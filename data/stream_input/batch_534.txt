B000002LND|5.0|This is still one of the best selling compilation albums ever, selling 23 million copies worldwide. It's truly wondering. It could use \\"True Blue\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", and \\"Who's That Girl\\", But other than that, this collection is wildly Immaculate! Madonna still reigns as the queen of pop, and always will!

B00005R24K|5.0|Ash (Campbell) and a few of his friends have rented a cabin among the rural woods in the middle of nowhere. They discover an old book and a tape recorder in the basement. The book turns out to be the Necromonicon and the tape recorder contains readings of its incantations. Yikes! After playing the tape, ancient horrors are unleashed through the woods and the cabin becomes a nightmarish slaughterhouse. One by one, they're possessed by demons. And the only way to finish off an out-of-control demonic zombie freak? Total dismemberment! As his friends succumb to the evil spirits, Ash must fight them off in a bloody battle of unstoppable terror. Evil shows him no pity as he fights for his life as well as his soul.<br /><br />Mixing together a sick sense of humor, bucketloads of gore, and a simple yet frightening story, I believe The Evil Dead succeeds at becoming the epitome of a great horror flick. This is a cult classic if there ever was one, and it certainly deserves the reputation. I recommend it to any fan of the genre. You must see it to believe it!
B000066JES|5.0|Excuse me, but you must be OUT OF YOUR MIND, Matt Stoesl. Calling Manowar soft power metal is like saying Iron Maiden invented the New Wave of British Heavy Metal! Manowar is actually certified as the loudest band in the history of music!<br /><br />Anyhoo, all anger aside, this album was one I came pretty close to buying once after watching the video for the awesome title track (even if it is shortened a bit from the full cut), reading mostly positive reviews on my favorite metal info site, Metal-Rules.com, and hearing some appetizing samples. Overall, Manowar are still a somewhat cocky band, but they still have come a long way from going crazy enough to call THEMSELVES the kings of metal (that would be Iron Maiden!) However, some might argue this statement, saying that if they are the loudest band ever, you might as well consider them metal's true kings because it's got a lot to do with the loud. Well...good point, but I don't buy it. Anyway, I recommend Manowar's 2002 album for its awesome production, sheer power, and strong musicianship..and also, I can safely say that this is by far their better album of two in a decade, the vocals sounded a little off on Louder Than Hell (1996), but all their albums at least deserve a good listen. That IS, if you don't mind how unbearably cheesy these guys can get, the utter volume, or the glass-shattering falsetto wail their singer is capable of.
B0002DB50E|4.0|After several viewings of Naked Lunch I have now indulged on this new dvd rerelease from Cronenberg and I must say that he is intent on getting his message out explicitly to whomever views this film. We hardly see any modern science fiction films reaching up to this level of subject matter in such a raw demeanor which easily sets this a timeless classic in its genre. The subtlety of the plot makes each scene more abrasive in its aim to shock the viewer and the special effects really set the bar to the era this film was made. Also the developement of Max Renn's character is convincing as he is becoming more and more desensitized to The Videodrome until the boundaries between the two subjects become blurred and Max inevitably becomes a \\"monster\\" as a result of his exposure to it. Cronenbergs' stories seem to deal with the mutation of the human being with the more perilous being that we created with technology and the end result and not a pretty one. Such a criticism on our modern evolution is definitely the point he wants to get out in his films and although I have yet to see \\"The Fly\\" I'm sure it will be a proponent of this inherent philosphy. By interpreting it in such a creative and entertaing way do I rate Cronenberg as being of the greatest science fiction storytellers of late, portraying the plight of human existence in the realm of technological overstimulation. A must for any modern science fiction or post-structuralism readers.

1594200106|5.0|I have read this book a few months ago and up to this day, I still am mesmerized with the story. This book will forever linger in my mind. I hope Carlos Ruiz Zafon will have his other books translated to English ASAP. It is a shame if only the spanish speaking people are able to enjoy his books. Pls. have it translated. It is difficult not to compare this book with books I have read afterwards. This is the benchmark. I have lend my copy of the Shadow of the Wind and so far it hasn't been returned. Honestly I wouldn't mind buying another copy again. After I have read this book, I felt so happy to have discovered such a wonderful book. It's like winning a lotto. I felt in love and floating on air. I was and is still eager to tell people that they should get hold of a copy of this book. It is just so wonderful. It makes you feel younger after reading it. Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing style makes reading enjoyable, not to mention I like the witty jokes injected in the conversations. Like most of the others here, I too got enchanted by the Shadow of the Wind!

B0006L16N8|1.0|The name of the band is like the explaination for that horrible music blaring out of the radio speakers.  They are so dull that I'd probably fall asleep before I got thru the first song... The singer's voice sounds like nails on a chalk board. Truly these songs sound like remixes of their old songs (ehhem, clocks). <br />Invest your money into something else besides this untalented man's sad, depressing, sound-like-your-dying, and DULL as sin music.  <br />The only reason I'd buy this CD is if I needed a cure for insominia or perhaps some music for a funeral of someone you hated.

Still like it alot and I'm glad I bought it and gave it a chance.
B000A6CLL0|4.0|The third season of \\"Enterprise\\" had its challenges: the ratings were sagging and the producers were hoping to increase viewership; facing strong critical reaction from fans the series became much more action based with stronger stories that separated it from \\"Voyager\\" and put it more in the leage of \\"Deep Space Nine\\" (still the finest \\"Trek\\" series IMO). If you like \\"Enterprise\\" this is probably the seasont that truly got you hooked. With the season long story arc of the Xindi, Enterprise went into uncharted territory for the series. The Xindi are a race that have designed a weapon to kill everyone on Earth. They've discovered that humanity will, in the future, destroy their planet so they've elected to strike before that event occurs. Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) and his crew have this information revealed by a time traveler involved in the Temporal Cold War from season one for his own nefarious reasons. By the way there is a podcast for one of the best episodes during the third season \\"Twilight\\" available at the offical \\"Star Trek\\" website with writer Michael Sussman and moderator Tom Gaskill. Why this wasn't included on the boxed set, I don't know but it's an excellent podcast. This one unlike the others was designed for the DVD boxed set for the third season.<br /><br />Enterprise goes into the uncharted Delphic Expanse where the laws of physics are sometimes altered by the anomolies encountered in the region and the mysterious metallic spheres located throughout the region. Enterprise is on a desperate mission to discover the Xindi homeworld in hopes of stopping the weapon (which has already been tested on Florida leaving 7 million dead at the end of season two)or convincing the Xindi that Earth is not a threat. Bakula came into his own this season playing a decision battle hardened Archer. The optical effects and sets are impressive as are the different alien species some of which are portrayed via CGI.<br /><br />Although it wasn't a perfect series, \\"Enterprise\\" offered much hope for the franchise during the third and fourth season (before the disasterous and horrible final episode of season four). As usual the image quality on this series is top notch and Paramount keeps getting better with the extras. I did, however, have to go back and return three separate sets before I got a complete set that wasn't defective which was extremely frustrating.<br /><br />The extras this time around include a discussion as to why producers Braga and Berman brought on Manny Coto (the talented writer/producer/creator of \\"Odyssey Five\\")as a writer/producer. There's also a discussion as to the reasons for the season long Xindi story arc introduced at the end of season two. There's a very good featurette on directing the show featuring Roxann Dawson, outtakes, deleted scenes, a couple of commentary tracks by Manny Coto and Assistant director Mike De Merritt on shooting the episode \\"North Star\\". Also we get text commentary on three episodes \\"Impulse\\", \\"Count Down\\" and \\"Xindi\\" by Michael and Denise Okuda. There's also a profile of Connor Trinner aka \\"Trip\\". Trinner honestly assesses the changes in the character he started to make as the series progressed (for the good). There's also a photo gallery, episode synposis booklet and Easter eggs.<br /><br />While this was a shorter seson (24 vs. 26), the third season was a huge improvement over the first two and made for compelling action driven science fiction. While there were a few missteps (\\"Doctor's Orders\\" which basically was a rewrite of a \\"Voyager\\" episode) most of the season was very strong with some of the best written episodes seen since \\"Deep Space Nine\\".<br /><br />Complaints? The price is still way too high although the design for the packaging is unique and nice (that's what you're paying for along with the extensive extras). Also, \\"Enterprise\\" should have been given another year to see what Coto and Alan Brennart (\\"The Twilight Zone\\") could have done as they did excellent work during season four as well. Now that \\"Star Trek\\" seems retired (for the moment) it does allow the oppportunity to reinvent the franchise and give it renewed energy. \\"Enterprise\\" wasn't a wasted journey but a worthwhile one with a top notch cast and writing/direction at the end of the series.ring season four as well.

B000A0GP4K|4.0|On Charlie Rose, Scorsese said that he would be willing to continue the documentary if there is more footage, but it is not his decision. I don't recall if he knew how much more footage there was -- clearly he'd want to avoid just rehashing stuff.

0393035158|5.0|Given the inertia of faith theology it is an uphill road to even discuss, let alone challenge, the 'faith myths' that are really exploitations of human belief psychology. Doctrinal or dogmatic injunctions to have faith cripple the rational powers of those who are just on the threshold of 'true religion/philosophy' in the mechanization of thought processes. This gets called 'religion' or the 'sacred'. So this nervy challenge to the whole game is quite on the ball, and in the current cultural/political atmosphere courageously to the point. That said, the discourses of 'faith' have a number of dimensions, and a simple change of terminology can help where genuine issues of faith have a philosophical, if not dogmatic, significance. And it should be pointed out in passing that Mr. Harris' readers might be fairly charged with a new kind of faith, in the Darwinian religion, this not being the place to go into that. Faith is not only an issue of divinity, but potentially also of questions of 'soul' or 'free will', in the Kantian perspective. There the question of what constitutes 'self' or 'moral agency' is confronted by the noumenal and the limits of our representations, likely to condemn us to a platonic cave of reduced self-consciousness. There the issue of faith in something more than oneself can arise as challenge to 'know oneself'. But of course the misuse of the term 'faith' in such a context is all too likely, and one should simply proceed to a new conceptual recasting: one should consider one's 'hunch' (not faith) as to a 'deeper self' more than mere imagination, proceeding with a dialectially skeptical 'faith' that this deeper reality might exist at one's psychological limits. There are many such issues in that vein, which point to original and lost meanings of 'faith', a term that deserves Mr. Harris' challenges, and which should be retired from discourse, short of suffering the tortoise effect of excessively dumbed down materialistic metaphysics.
B000002TQV|1.0|Radiohead are garbage. I never liked them. The lead singer is really ugly and you can't even dance to this music. Buy something from Jimi Hendrix or Bruce Springsteen instead.
B00005NGAL|5.0|Awesome dancing! Great singing/meowing! Fun characters!<br /><br />The DVD starts off with tons of pairs of cat eyes popping out with the introductory overture. Then the jellicle song comes audible in cresendo. You start seeing a number of cats crawling around the stage, that's when the action starts to come in. Andrew Lloyd sure made a explosive opening to the world of cats. Different cats are then introduced like Mankustrap, Macavity, Grizabella etc.<br /><br />Generally,there wasn't a fixed plot like a cat's life that has no plot at all. They spend most of their lives hunting for food and sleeping except that the cats in the musical broadway came alive preparing to be chosen to lead a new jellicle life.<br /><br />The part with Bombalurina and Demeter singing Macavity. Great voices and dancing! There were still some other well-composed songs like 'Jellicle song', 'skimbleshanks the railway cat', and more.<br /><br />The stage setting was marvellous. It was made to look like an abandoned alley at night when cats start coming out. Lighting effects were done really well too. One of the most interesting advantage is that the choreography was totally awesome! Every step was perfect and well rehearsed.<br /><br />Though all the music factors are perfect, there may be some understanding difficulty for some audiences. There's no doubt that in each scene, new types of cats are introduced. One critizm, Bustopher Jones and Gus were two very unnecessary characters. The songs were good though but the scenes were lame.Audiences who have hard times catching things up shouldn't watch this DVD for understanding purposes but to simply enjoy the songs.<br /><br />I believe this is one very unique type of broadway. Every cat has this slick, tight costume which enables him/her to dance more comfortably. Added up with the background scenes, the actors look like real cats. There may have been a few too many times of close-ups but hey! This is a movie right? You don't expect the camera to stay at one point!<br /><br />I already watched it in school last year during our music lessons but I thought it was just so great that I decided to buy it.

0790744295|4.0|As in other genres of film, the horror movie has always had a symbiotic relationship with the world of literature. Most of the really great fright films came from books. How many versions of Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" have made it to the big screen? Or how about Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\"? Dozens upon dozens of variations on those two novels alone sit on videostore shelves. A related scheme involves finding a hot horror author to pen a screenplay, one based on the writer's own work or pulled from his or her fertile imagination. Enter Stephen King, the modern master of horror and a man whose every dribbling seems to find its way to the big screen. A list of King's cinematic translations essentially mirrors his bibliography: \\"Salem's Lot,\\" \\"The Tommyknockers,\\" \\"Misery,\\" \\"It,\\" \\"Needful Things,\\" \\"The Stand,\\" \\"Pet Semetary\\"--the list could go on and on ad infinitum. Even his short stories reappear as pictures. But \\"Creepshow\\" is a bit different. Here's a movie uniting King's love of the old E.C. Comics of the 1950s and his writing skills with veteran horror director George Romero. The result is a wildly uneven anthology of five excursions into the realms of terror and madness.<br /><br />I'm not going to discuss each of the five tales in the film. I'll summarize what I think are the two best tales in the movie and then let you decide whether \\"Creepshow\\" sounds like your cup of tea. Hopefully, this approach will avoid spoiling the whole film for you. First up is \\"The Crate,\\" which on the surface doesn't seem like fertile ground for screams and gore. But give it a chance to warm up and you'll see some bloody shenanigans boasting enough fun for the whole family--if you're the Manson Family. Professor Henry Northrup (Hal Holbrook), a patrician English instructor at a small university, has a big problem. It has nothing to do with grading papers or recalcitrant undergraduates and everything to do with his wife Wilma (Adrienne Barbeau). Known as \\"Billie\\" to her intimates, Wilma is an abrasive alcoholic who constantly puts her husband down. Everyone on campus hates her drunken escapades, especially Henry, but there's nothing he can do until a gruesome discovery underneath a stairwell in the science department offers hope of salvation. A crate with a very special occupant resides there, you see, an occupant with a hunger for human flesh. Every henpecked husband would love what Henry does.<br /><br />The second tale worth discussing is \\"They're Creeping Up On You.\\" Essentially a one man show, this grotesque story will have you running for the shower. Upson Pratt (E.G. Marshall) is a Howard Hughes type tycoon spending the last years of his life living in a modern, airtight penthouse in a big metropolis. Pratt's fear of germs and bugs, primarily roaches, is matched only by his boundless greed. He berates his underlings on the telephone, ruins his competition with the click of a few computer keys, and laughs in the face of a woman who blames him for the death of her husband. What a nice guy! Not to worry, however, since Upson Pratt is about to get his comeuppance in a particularly slithery, crunchy way. Roaches have invaded his apartment, roaches that seem impervious to insecticide as they find their way into every nook and cranny. More bugs appear, followed by even more. Then the power goes out. Uh oh. In an attempt to make a stand against his greatest fear, Pratt retreats to a sealed chamber in the apartment. What happens next surely ranks as one of the most nauseating moments in horror film history. This scene makes the movie, and is a fitting way to conclude the film.<br /><br />Fun stuff, these two stories. Both are filled with plenty of memorable moments. I laugh every time I see \\"The Crate,\\" largely due to Henry's violence filled fantasy sequences in which he rids the world of Wilma. Good squib work on Barbeau's head! \\"The Crate\\" is also memorable for the icky gore effects seen in disgusting closeup. The special effects in \\"They're Creeping Up On You\\" are amazing too, at least in the one scene in which realism really counts. Ugh. If you hate bugs, you'll have trouble sleeping for years after watching this tale. E.G. Marshall ought to have won some sort of award for putting up with the things Romero made him do. These two stories are so good that they make the other three look lame in comparison--although the entry starring Leslie Nielsen as a betrayed husband works because we see a side of this actor rarely on display in his films. All five do share a few characteristics, namely a film style designed to make them look like a comic book story. Romero used framing and intense bursts of light during moments of fright and the denouement of each tale to give them that comic feel, and it really works. Trivia buffs will want to look for King's son in the story that frames the movie and Tom Savini as a garbage man. Fun, fun, fun!<br /><br />The DVD, unfortunately, isn't as much fun. As others have already noted, the \\"Creepshow\\" disc is a bare bones affair with a trailer as the only extra. Horror fans, and we are legion, would love to see a disc that includes at the very least a Romero/King commentary track. I'd also like to see an uncut version of the film that incorporates the ten minutes of footage left on the cutting room floor. Oh well. It's still nice to see a fondly remembered classic that I haven't watched in years. If you like horror movies, definitely give \\"Creepshow\\" a watch. The film's weakest moments are easily eclipsed by its overall greatness. Have fun!Creeping Up On You\\" are amazing too, at least in the one scene in which realism really counts. Ugh.

B00008J2DQ|4.0|I'm going to break this down very simply, because alot of very dumb sounding people have a habit of reviewing albums like this one. Godsmack started off excellently with their debut, and I think blew most people away. It reminded me alot of a certain style of metal that was missing on the airwaves between Disturbed, Korn, Slipknot, and System of a Down. Great songs, no doubt about that. Awake, their second album, was a disappointment. It was, in essence, exactly like the first one, but just harder and heavier sounding. Musically, they clearlymatured, but it was just too much the same. <br /> <br />Faceless is a step in the right direction. I still think their debut is their best one, but Faceless is finally something different from them. It points in a slightly new direction than the previous two albums did, both musically and lyrically. It's remininscent of Metallica, who, although maturing very slowly, did start to branch out on Ride the Lightning and on And Justice for All. <br /> <br />So, if you're a Godsmack fan like I am, I suggest finding this album on the cheap. It's good to have for a collection, but not for the full price.
B0006J28MI|1.0|Ouch! We can add another batch of compost to the trash heap that is Macaulay Culkin's career.  While he may have been somewhat entertaining in HOME ALONE, by the time RICHIE RICH was made, Culkin's lack of real depth is on full display.  While I won't say that this is the worst kid's movie I have ever seen, it is definitely up there.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that speak about the film's mixed messages.  For example, we are supposed to believe that a man who has singlehandedly built an empire that could topple other nations is completely disinterested in money & wealth, choosing instead to lock up his memories in his secret vault and spend all of his time canoodling with his wife.  Moreover, there is a problem surrounding Richie's dilemma.  It is an old one: the rich kid with no friends.  Richie just wants to play baseball like everyone else.  The movie is, to a large extent, a resolution of that problem.  What's the solution?  Have your father build a baseball diamond in your backyard, furnish your friends with uniforms, and allow you all to have a ball (complete with an in-house umpire).  The message: money can't buy you love.  But, oh boy, does it help!<br /><br />I remember really enjoying the cartoon while I was a kid, but this film fails to recreate the \\"feeling\\" of those comics.  Instead, it exploits the few talents Culkin has and goes for the classic, boring family movie.  Don't bother with RICHIE RICH.  You're better off sticking to other gems in Culkin's trash-pile, such as HOME ALONE or HOME ALONE 2: LOST IN NEW YORK.
B00007E8V4|5.0|People have varying views over this album. This one isn't as brutal and vicious as the debut or as Toxicity, but it's excellent in its melodic, fast paced, introspective metal ways. An album of contrasts, really. In particular, I want to address the issue of Thetawaves. Personally, I like this song alot. However, Steal This Album has become one of those cds I feel a need to listen to as a whole, without skipping songs. If you listen closely, Thetawaves seems to just end, however its end immediately leads into the compeltely different Roulette, and they almost seem to become two different approaches to the same idea. I suggest only listening to those songs together, back-to-back as they are on the album. Especially given that the lyrics on Thetawaves end on \\"and,\\" and seem to pick up again in Roulette. Just keep it in mind, and the album becomes that much more enjoyable.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|I heard about J.

B000002N2Z|5.0|I got into the deftones in 98 after their semi mainstream success with Around The Fur managed to catch my attention.  Ever since they have been competing for the title of my favorite band.  Adrenaline is their debut album and their most collectively heavy.  It features some of their best songs and trademark difficult to understand song meanings.  The singer tends to use his voice more like an instrament at times during this record.  The deftones were doing the rap/rock thing way before it because popular with bands like Papa Roach and Limp Bizkit.  Not to say that this album is some type of rapcore but it is more so than their other records.  Ironically its when the genre became popular that the deftones abandoned it all together going in a different direction.  Adrenaline is a great album to play when your feeling angry, or just wanna rock out to something heavy but intelligent.  As much as I like adrenaline its not my favorite deftones record.  I like them in this order.    1.  Around The Fur  2.  White Pony  3.  Adrenaline  4   deftones/self titled    Please note that no deftones album is bad,  so please check them all out because each own offers a different flavor.  Even though I say I like some better than others, its only by a very minute margin, I love every deftones album.
B000002KBD|5.0|This is it.  Sssshhhhhhhh.    We don't want word to get around about how fabulous this cd is because this one is for discriminating listeners; not the people who buy \\"best of\\" compilations.    If you can find a song that beats \\"I'll be your lover\\" I'd like to hear it.
B0009NZ3BO|5.0|After an abortive release due to the serious mastering errors noted elsewhere, the corrected version is at last available.  I've always felt this album was underrated by GG fans, largely because it was never properly mastered before--even the original vinyl release sounded weak. But now that this album has at long last been properly mastered, I can say that my high expectations have been more than met. \\"Interview\\" has never sounded so good! <br /> <br />So without further ado, for those of you who are not familiar with this gem, here's the blow by blow: <br /> <br />1) \\"Interview\\"--a playful adventure in hard-driving, pointilistic funk, with Kerry alternating between organ stabs and lilting electric piano until the instrumental bridge--and oh my god, what a bridge! First Kerry cuts loose on thumbtack (i.e. honky-tonk) piano for a bit--which slides into a minimalist section featuring assorted weird sounds while Gary plays a complex melodic line that's catchier than it should be--on what sounds like an electric sitar! It's nothing short of wondrous in that way only GG can do. Peaks out to a beautiful, majestic end! WOW!!! <br /> <br />2) \\"Give It Back\\"--Back in the day the band took some heat for doing this song, I guess because it seemed somewhat trendy to do a reggaeish tune in 1976. However, decades later it's hard to imagine why we wouldn't want to hear John and Ray tackle reggae in alternating 7/8 and 5/8 time, especially with a Zappaesque atonal bridge featuring MARIMBA!!! I think it's delightful, very fun and uplifting. Unlike anything else they ever recorded. <br /> <br />3) \\"Design\\"--It's natural to want to compare this to GG's other masterpieces utilizing a capella vocals, \\"Knots\\" and \\"On Reflection\\". While the others were, respectively, clever and joyous, this one could best be described as dark and haunting. Anybody who thinks that GG's experiments were lacking in passion should be exposed to this--Kerry's melancholy lead over dissonant background vocals,and jarring drums that crash in a tribal crescendo. THIS is the sound of dreams shattering. <br /> <br />4) \\"Another Show\\"--Another take on the \\"Cogs in Cogs'\\" style of controlled chaos, done in breakneck 10/8 time, with John Weathers absolutely all over the place. Could be alternatively titled \\"See Kerry Abuse His Hammond Pt. 1\\", as he plays tuned percussion and whammy bar sounds on his organ. Fun, fun, fun!!! <br /> <br />5) \\"Empty City\\"--I think this song in particular suffered from the poor mastering on the original release. Here, it's a lush, dramatic pop song featuring Ray and Gary on twin acoustic guitars, Kerry on tres '70s e-piano and string synth, great saxes by Derek (his best ever, IMHO), and another beautiful choral arrangement. Simply lovely. <br /> <br />6) \\"Timing\\"--or \\"See Kerry Abuse His Hammond Pt.2\\" as he uses his organ to play grunge guitar. Meanwhile Ray pulls out his trusty violin and saws into your brain, and Gary performs what Jack Black would call a \\"face-melting guitar solo\\". The atonal, crunching bridge suggests that GG had been listening to KC's \\"Red\\" album for inspiration. The band never rocked harder than they did here. Awesome!!! <br /> <br />7) \\"I Lost My Head\\"--Everybody's favorite song off the album in its original release, and it sounds even better now--partly because some sweet compression has been added to the track, and partly because everything else on the album sounds so great. Kerry's delicate vocals and fetching instrumental counterpoint (featuring real harpsichord, I believe) open the song. Then it rises, and adroitly slides into the closing theme while the hair stands up on the back of your neck, in anticipation of the glorious riff-rock coda. And there it is, perhaps GG's greatest riff, the band pounding it home while Derek wails passionately, before fading into eternity. A wonderful cherry on top of a perfect sundae. <br /> <br />The live version of \\"Interview\\" is rather poorly recorded, and not that well performed. Butno matter. If you think you've heard the album before, you haven't--the remastering has finally revealed the genius of the music. And if you've never heard the album before, well, you're in for a treat, because I think it stands among the pantheon of great GG albums now, alongside \\"Octopus\\", \\"IAGH\\", \\"Free Hand\\", and \\"TPATG\\"--really.  <br /> <br />My last words? BUY IT--NOW!!! <br />
B000777J2S|3.0|My sister harangued me until I bought this cd and, at first, I really didn't think much of it.  I dug out my Rufus Wainright cds and listened to them, instead (I didn't know he was on the cd, but the music reminded me of his).  But then \\"I hope someone\\" caught me and I've been a gonner, ever since. <br /> <br />I don't adore it and I have yet to play it for friends but, on a certain evening, when I'm in a certain kind of mood this - and a glass of wine- helps me relax on my deck while I look at the moon. <br /> <br />That in itself is remarkable.
0385424736|4.0|Rudy Baylor is about to graduate from law school in Memphis.  It's been tough but he's finally there, and he has a great job lined up with a respected local firm.  One of his last classes is legal issues for the aged and infirm, and part of it involves giving free legal help.  It is here that he meets Dot Black, who has a medical insurance policy covering her family.  Her son, Donny Ray, was diagnosed with leukemia, but the company has refused to cover a bone marrow transplant.  Things appear to favor the Blacks, and Rudy has his first client.  And it's a good thing because due to a merger he suddenly finds he no longer has the great job he'd been promised, and ends up working for the sleaziest lawyer in town with a bunch of ambulance chasers.  He's broke and it just gets tougher from there.<br /><br />A very exciting story and full of legal drama.  Plus, being told from Rudy's perspective allows for a very funny sense of sarcasm to come across.  A number of side stories keep it from becoming boring, and keep you guessing what's coming next, even though not everything is tied up all neat and tidy.  And there was a twist at the end that I found especially interesting, but still very satisfying (my book had about 15 blank pages at the end so it kinda fooled me into thinking the end wasn't as near as it really was).

0062502182|5.0|Well, here's one of the most amazing books i've ever read. I found it on my aunt's shelf before making a huge decision that would affect my life forever: whether i was going to marry or not. And this book came along not only to help me with my decision, but to help me face some of the difficulties i was going to encounter on my way to get where i wanted to be. Its simple narration makes it possible for different age audiences to read and enjoy this book, and for its teachings to sink deep in the heart of whoever reads it. You'll never regret reading this book.
B0001AP12G|5.0|When i first saw kanye west he was talking to Jimmy Kimmel on his TV show.  I had heard his name before but i had never heard any of his songs.  He came across as not only confident in himself, but he seemed VERY cocky when it came to his ability.  He claimed this would be the best rap album this year.  Of course i was a fan of 50 cent and thought to myself that this was just another cocky rapper trying to hype himself.  I could not be more wrong.  I heard Slow Jamz and i thought it was a very entertaining song.  Of course he had a rapper by the name of twista who was also from chicago as well as Jamie Foxx who was critically acclaimed for his performance in Ray as Ray Charles.  Needless to say this made me quickly realize that Kanye West was talented.  My sister bought the Album and I burned it from her.  It quickly became one of my favorites.  I was a huge fan of Jesus Walks, right before it became a smash superhit.  It was easily the most controversial and biggest hit.  After hearing the album the whole way through which i have only done with AC/DC's Back in Black, Led Zeppelins Greatest hits album, And The best of Guns n' Roses.  Needless to say, this was a heavily favored album by me and not even one of my favorite genres.  But Kanye West combined powerful lyrics, with a good beat and music with a message.  In my opinion the best debut rap album of my generation.
0156012197|5.0|I love this book. I didn't get to read until i was already a grown-up, but that made it even more meaningful. It's the first book a ever read with my husband when we first married. I recommend it, not only for kids (because you will obviously find it in the Children's section) but for adults, for those grown-ups that want to stick this book in a kids shelf because they think it would be childish to read it. Read it. You won't regret it... and i'll asure you'll treasure its simple but deep teachings.
B00005JNEW|5.0|In Odessa, Texas, the only thing the town cares about is football.  The boys are treated like Royalty in a town where football is king.  After being dubbed the number 2 team, with the Number one Player.  They still believe they will win the state championship.  Things look great in their first game but after leaving their star Boobie Miles in even after a blowout.  The other team starts gunning for him and he gets a career- ending injury.  After a devastating loss in their first game without Boobie, they find a star in 3rd string runningback Chris Comer.  Throughout the story they learn lessons about life as they face diversity to make it into the state championship.  The story isnt so much about a glory-filled victory season but more about overcoming adversity and doing as much as you can to not let your friends down.
B000002J09|5.0|This should be the second-best selling album of all time (behind the first Led Zeppelin album). It's great to hear \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in the context of the whole album, the way it was meant to be heard, before \\"classic rock syndicators, using data that said that it was consistently the 'most requested' song on American radio, played it to death\\" (from Russell David Harper's fun but slightly unhinged book about the High Life called BALD [2005]; none of the members of Led Zeppelin appear to have gone bald, more proof that they must have sold their souls--and not just to Atlantic Records).
0740748475|5.0|I grew up on Calvin and Hobbes and the Far Side. These two iconic comics share the common trait of ending their runs while very popular.  The wonder of Calvin and Hobbes is that it distils truth and opinion so simply (through Calvin) and each of us can relate to him. The set is vert nicely done, with nice color artwork and very nice reproductions.  I don't have problems with editorial changes to a few comics. I don't see the harm in it in the least.  I do wish that Watterson had included some kind of commentary to go along with some of the comics, as he had in some of the compilation books. The insights in the introduction are good, but left me wanting more.  I still rate it 5 stars. Its great to have in my home. I think my family will enjoy it for many, many years.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is the best I've seen Clapton play in years! The whole band is in top form, especially Jack Bruce's voice. Shot in High Definition. High point,(and there are many) 'We're Going Wrong'. Don't think about this one, BUY IT.

B000AADYRQ|3.0|I will be the first to say that I wanted to absolutely hate plans. I'm a bit of a snob about music, and the fact that Death Cab effectually \\"sold out\\" in switching from Seattle's Barsuk Records to the towering halls of Atlantic, as well as being featured on the 90210 of our days- \\"The O.C.\\" had me more than a little disappointed in one of my favorite bands.    But, much to my dismay, I couldn't bring myself to hate this album. I wanted to decry them as another indie band that sold out and flopped (see...well almost every one of them). Thanks to DFCF keeping underrated producer/guitarist Chris Walla behind the console, the music keeps much of its pre-big label feel.     The unfortunate thing about the album is the direction the lyrics have taken. Instead of keeping with the angst of middle class America, the theme which brought the band so dear to the hearts of so many, Ben Gibbard has turned to the more widely applicable themes of the struggle of humanity. The problem here is that Gibbard writes best when he writes about what he knows best, and he is clearly stretching on this album. He is forced away from clear, poignant lyrics into the substitution of ambiguous analogy when discussing the relationship of death and love. It works...but only kind of.    The album is musically top-notch. Atlantic has clearly given DCFC the tools and studio time they need to create a slick pop album. It flows well, even into the tracks that are obviously the singles.     My single biggest qualm with this album is simply personal. It just feels like it was written to be played as background music on a television drama (shockingly...). Death Cab's charm was in the intimacy of the lyrics, IMO. Gibbard wrote songs that captured moments that could be shared. He has strayed here, into the Big Themes, and lost the heart of the band's message.     That being said, there are some real stars on this album. \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" and \\"What Sarah Said\\" are some of DCFC's best work, musically. I hate to give the album with these gems on it a three star rating, but the interim songs are feeble enough to demand it.    Will the album be successful? Yes. Will millions of people hear it? Yes. Will it become the theme music for the twenty-somethings of this decade? Quite possibly. If those are the criteria for a great album, then this album is great. If a great album lies in heartfelt lyrics, genuine music, and experimentation, this album leaves much to be desired.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|when you have the perfect casting, they all have chemistry, like in Seinfield, Friends and X- Files you get a great show. I remember starting to watch this on tv back in 02 and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately as I got hooked, Fox moved it around and as I understand it showed in the wrong order and I do remember they did not show the first episode which explains Serenity's roots either at all or way into the show. <br />SO... now I get it all in order and I LOVE it. I love Mal ( Captain Reynolds) played by the charming and gives good face, Nathan Fillion, he's a dark and battered character with a smidgen of a heart and soul left buring and when he lets that show, its a good day! He takes a good beating too. the action is great. story by Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel) his character development is amazing , the language used is unusual and makes the characters all the more people you want to meet, to get to know and hang out with. Capt'ns right hand woman is strong and smart, the mechanic is a gal with kindness and sexiness and Ron Glass plays a preacher with a past that I am dying to uncover. Everyone on board is special and adds to the crew and your experience as a viewer in their life.  It's a western set in space, they have space ships with the best pilot ever who's a leaf on the wind when he needs to be,but no tractor beams or laser gus, just guns with bullets. I recommend this dvd set to anyone curious. go to the official Serenity site and check it out. You'll not be dissapointed. OH yea! there is a crew member named Jayne, and HE'S no one to mess with....
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I am probably the biggest Gilmore fan ever!  But I haven't always been.  I began to get into the series when it was in reruns on ABC Family.  Then I began to watch the new episodes on the WB, and it happened to be during season five.  I was very entertained by the first half of the season, however I am extremely biased seeing as I am a huge Dean fan, but when Rory got involved with Logan, I think that the show took a turn.  Not for worse but, a turn in itself.  However, I really do love this season.  It is probably one of my favorites and I CAN'T WAIT to own it.  It you have the complete collection, then of course this will be a neccesity, but if you are just getting into the show, you will really enjoy this season with its various plot twists, both satisfying and sad.  Season Five is exciting, and almost a rebirthing period- bridging Rory into adulthood and Loralai into a new level of responsiblity and maturity.  It is a MUST-SEE!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|If you have any taste in music, this is a great artist and a great CD.  The song 'Goodbye My Lover' is hands down one of the most well written songs I've ever heard.
0312995423|1.0|I don't generally write reviews, but this book was so bad I felt I had too.  The characters are clich, the plot laughable, the dialogue patronizing and from a technology standpoint, he completely misses the boat.  Both the main characters are people so talented and gifted it's impossible to identify with them.  They're the perfect people just waiting to be a hero.   The dialogue is under researched, reads like buzzword bingo and appeals to external authorities to make his tech analysis without actual understanding of the concepts.  If you want to read a good Crypto novel try Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson.  I am seriously sorry I picked it up.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|This album is f---in' great! A vast collection of RoadRunner artists on 1 CD & they deliver on every level!  I'll be the first to admit that I was skeptical how the whole thing would turn out, but like Slipknot's Joey Jordison stated \\"this thing has come out better better than anyone expected.\\"  That quote is definitely the truth!  Come on, w/ artists such as King Diamond, Glen Benton, Peter Steele, Dino Cazares, Max Cavalera, Rob Barrett, Steve DiGiorgio, Rob Flynn, & MANY MANY more how can you lose!  Great CD & a true testament to RoadRunner's history!
B000002H33|3.0|Is that all you do J.P. is insult people? You Blow! Master of Puppets is a good album, but i think it is overrated, i mean this is no where near Sodom's \\"Persecution Mania\\" or Overkill's \\"Years of Decay\\". And since when is it uncool to like Slayer or Dark Angle? two bands that could make Metallica into their b%tches. <br /> <br />Clifford \\"the big red dog\\" Burton is way way way way overrated, have any of you 8th grade heavy metal morons ever heard of a man called Jaco Pastorius? He is the real king of bass, not this Burton poser. <br /> <br />Burton is nothing special at all,
B000AWYOGE|3.0|I am not typically fond of dark gloomy films illuminated by 12 watt bulbs; reeks too much of B-grade. Still, if one closed one's eyes and thought hard enough, one could find some hidden psychological connotations in this trench cinematography from the bowels of suburban New York.<br /><br />The meandering script tells of a broken family - mother and daughter, and a father scrambling for custody. The custody thing quickly goes nowhere. The little girl has imaginary friends. The dingy apartment in in tatters, leaks and all. There is an element of soaked dreariness about the whole affair. The screenplay seems stylized at first but does a pretty good job of testing your patience from about half its length onward.<br /><br />As a clear attempt to flesh out on The Ring 2 and thus tinker with the horror genre, Dark Water is thankfully removed from your average screamer. It even offers a steady chill or two. But it goofs up royally with its climax -- all three of them. Or were there more?<br /><br />I would probably catch it on cable, with liberal channel flicks, but here's a film that's not going on my Netflix wishlist anytime soon.
0385006896|5.0|I very much enjoy having ALL the Sherlock Holmes stories in a single volume. I would very much recommend a complete edition, such as this one.    This is quite a large volume, over 1100 pages, but for having so many pages it is not very bulky and can be carried around fairly easily.    I am now completely addicted, not only to Sherlock Holmes, but the whole genre. I have read every page of my complete edition and enjoyed every minute of it.    Do yourself a favor and buy this book - it will probably take you awhile to read it, since there's so much material (it took me quite awhile), but it is definitly well worth the time and money. It is not without reason that Sherlock Holmes is considered some of the best detective fiction there is.

B0002PUHF6|5.0|All I can say is how did I never hear of this movie until a few months ago??? It is now one of my favorite horror movies, from the acting (well most of it at least), to the story, to the action to the gore and blood, it's all top notch, which is surprising for a movie of this type. <br />I've seen my fair share of horror movies, and this honestly ranks up with the best of them...Day of the Dead, Dead Alive, Zombie 2, The Thing, just to name a few.
B000AADYRQ|3.0|I hate to give three stars to the album that contains \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" and \\"What Sarah Said,\\" but I'm afraid I'm duty bound. The problem is that the rest of it just doesn't adequately support those two songs. \\"Where Soul Meets Body,\\" \\"Your Heart is an Empty Room,\\" and \\"Different Names\\" are decent, but \\"Summer Skin,\\" \\"You Will Be Loved\\" and \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" are quite feeble, and the others are mediocre at best. Even worse, the bad songs drag down the better ones by using similar musical themes. There is not nearly enough variation in melodic structure or arrangement, and Ben Gibbard's lyrics often sound rehashed (Though to be perfectly fair, they do occasionally shine).<br /><br />I'm not going to start a tirade blaming all the problems on their major label deal; the production is a little slick, but overall it sounds a lot like The Photo Album. The trouble here is that they just don't seem to have as many good ideas as usual. Maybe they didn't spend enough time on this record, who knows. I think it's safe to hope for a better one next time; meanwhile, Transatlanticism is a lot more energetic and varied, for those who are interested.
B0007VNGX0|2.0|Paul Anderson shouldn't be allowed in hollywood period. The guy can't direct, and he can't write a good movie. <br />His second try at the Resident Evil series, while better then the first, is still crap compared to REAL horror movies. It's kinda like asking to be kicked in the nuts once instead of twice...ones better but who really wants either option? <br />I guess this is fine though for people who can't handle the real horror movies, like 15 year old girls and horny guys who only want to stare at the hot main star. It's generic and cheap looking at times, much more so then the budget would suggest. <br />I would only recommend this if you can't handle real horror, or if you've already seen all there is to see in the form of horror movies.
B000002UJQ|5.0|...but I'll say it anyway.  \\"OK Computer\\" is one of the best, most creative, most realized albums of the 90's.  The multiple layers, the brilliant concept, the impeccable attention to detail.  One could extol the greatness of this album for days, and still barely scratch the surface.  Unfortunately, when I bought this album a few years ago, I was in kind of a narrow-minded metal snob stage (hey, give me a break, I was young), and as such nearly missed the greatness of it.  But time, as it does, has shown the error of my ways, opened my eyes to countless new avenues of music, and as a result I've come to love this album very much.  (You probably won't necessarily have to go through something like that to get into this CD, but whatever works for you.)<br /><br />We already have thousands of great reviews talking this album up, so I'll try to be brief.  There is just so much greatness here, from the dense layers of \\"Airbag\\", to the wild dynamics of \\"Paranoid Android\\", to the spacy ambience of \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", to the majestic hooks of \\"Let Down\\" (easily one of the greatest songs I've ever heard), to the elegant piano melodies of \\"Karma Police\\", to the raucous hard rock of \\"Electioneering\\".  Listening to this album on a good soundsystem, and allowing its dynamic waves and myriad textures to fill your living room is quite an amazing experience (especially on a rainy day).<br /><br />Thom Yorke's vocals are an acquired taste for many (myself included), but his performance here is quite spectacular.  People don't give him nearly enough credit for his versatility.  He goes from soaring and powerful on \\"Paranoid Android\\", to fragile and vulnerable on \\"Exit Music\\", to dark and creepy on \\"Climbing up the Walls\\".  Sure, he can often be nasal and off-key, but you get used to it, or at least I did.  He's got character and feeling to outweigh his technical shortcomings by far.  I'll take him over just about any power metal singer any day.<br /><br />And of course, the musicians are great.  John Greenwood is a really creative guitarist, who uses his instrument to create stunning melodic soundscapes (and \\"Paranoid Android\\" has a pretty damn wicked solo).  Phil Selway is a solid, unique, and dexterous drummer, and Colin Greenwood contributes some tasty basslines.  Not to mention the layers of keyboards and programming, to add some nice electronic atmospheres (perfect for the futuristic imagery), and lots of eclecticism.<br /><br />Well jeez, I said I was going to be brief, but I guess I failed.  Oh well.  If you're a music fan, you owe it to yourself to hear this album.  It's just that simple.  Oh, and Radiohead are going to be in the next Harry Potter movie (Daniel Radcliffe is a big fan of theirs), so that should be interesting.e, the musicians are great.

B0009MAO46|5.0|I now remember what all the fuss was about.  This beautifully crafted work of art is now better then it was before.  Not only is the picture and extras outstanding BUT they added a EX audio option so that those of us with 6.1 audio systems can enjoy hearing the back speaker kick in. <br />You'll remember the characters and the interplay (and perhaps some of the plot) but what you'll forget is how it felt to watch toys come to life. <br />It was so great to see again.
B000002UAX|5.0|If you buy one Beatles album, buy this one. It's got everything. The Beatles weren't the hardest rockin' band ever, but this album has four of their 10 most kick-arse songs (USSR/Birthday/Monkey/Helter Skelter). It also has serene folk (Blackbird/Mother Nature's Son/Longx3/I Will), desperate longing (Julia) and the ability to provoke vicious arguments (ObLaDiObLaDa/Piggies/Rev9/the various Honey Pies). The best drumming on the album is by Paul (the end section of Dear Prudence) and one of the catchiest vocal melodies is by Ringo (Don't Pass Me By). And I'm So Tired is the greatest song of all time (if you have 2 kids under 3). Sure, it's got some crap (I tend to think most of the \\"vicious argument\\" songs don't offer much - Honey Pie is especially annoying) but that's part of its charm and a significant reason why you should get it - the Beatles were human and they weren't perfect. It even has Yoko solo (followed by a line that predicted the Beatles' future - \\"his Mummy butted in\\") and Yoko and Linda together (harmonies on Birthday). It's definitely better than early Thomas the Tank Engine.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Ok, here it is in a nutshell, this is almost like a watching a Batman documentary, no over the top villians, no goofy sidekicks, just the complete origin of Batman. Very good acting and well paced, this movie is the polar opposite of Batman & Robyn.
B000000W5L|5.0|Better than the White Album and in many ways more diverse and dynamic. Probably the greatest pop or rock album ever made, at least in terms of scope, depth and vibe. Best use of horns on a rock record, Charlie's best drumming (Rocks Off and Rip This Joint blast outta the blocks) and Mick's best lyrics (Tumblin' Dice - could argue for Brown Sugar). Get it if ya ain't got it.
B000B0QOJA|4.0|Coming on the heels of Blue Note's highly publicized and equally highly anticipated \\"Thelonius Monk Quartet with John Coltrane At Carnegie Hall,\\" Impulse! releases yet another performance from the vault by John Coltrane and his celebrated quartet (Jimmy Garrison, McCoy Tyner, and Elvin Jones).  Produced by Coltrane's son, Ravi, and containing performances from two nights at the Half Note in New York City, such a cast and setting seems to make this recording too good to pass up.  However, even though this album features two full discs of live Coltrane, we are presented with only four extended cuts: \\"One Down, One Up,\\" which is the lengthy highlight of the album, a shorter \\"Afro-Blue,\\" an astounding, passionate rendition of \\"Song of Praise,\\" and a 23-minute foray into sonic pyrotechnics with Coltrane's staple, \\"My Favorite Things.\\"<br /><br />If you are a Coltrane completist, such as myself, then you probably realize that we've seen a release similar to this already: LaserLight's \\"Live at the Half Note\\" released a few years back.  And if you own this disc, then you'll find you already own two of the tracks featured here.  I find it disappointing that Impulse! is unable to deliver the entire performances from the Half Note.  However, in terms of sound quality, this album wins hands down<br /><br />In terms of live performance, these two discs cannot measure up to the audible ferocity and contrasting poignant lyricism which makes up the \\"Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings\\" or even the Master Takes from those sessions - but I doubt anything ever could topple such a performance from its throne.  However, I find this performance much more personable, more directed and whole lot more listenable than the 4-CD \\"Live in Japan\\" or the comparable 2-CD \\"Live in Seattle.\\"  In terms of an actual album, these two discs present a very cohesive rhythmic outfit with Garrison, Tyner, and Jones always keeping ahead of Coltrane's improvisational shenanigans.<br /><br />As a completist, this album isn't worth passing up.  However, as a casual listener still unfamiliar with Coltrane's more exploratory ventures within his own music, I recommend \\"Live at Birdland\\" or the \\"Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings\\" before diving into something as involved and multifaceted as this album.a completist, this album isn't worth passing up.

B000000W5F|5.0|The most under-rated Stone's album by the length of Wyman's conquest roll. Start Me Up has a great intro but I think it's a bit of a goin-nowhere track. The highlights are T&A, Hang Fire (a nice slap to Thatcher - whoever said Mick is a convert to the left?), Neighbours and Waiting on a Friend (best sax solo in rock ever - of course it had to be Sonny Rollins). The Fast side/slow side approach actually works, unlike Rod the Silly Sod's Atlantic Crossing, even if it's made redundant by the CD age. Better than Some Girls and everything else post-Jimmy Miller.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I rarely listen to music like this.  I suppose you could argue that the vast majority of people rarely listen to music like this.  There are few baritones that sing music that straddles pop and classical, choosing instead to sing pop where it is easier to attain commercial success.  How fortunate for us to hear this young man as he furthers his career with the release of this, his second album.<br /><br />The first song on this CD is one of the best.  \\"Oceano\\" is a gorgeous song that highlights Josh's wonderful voice, keeping the instruments just far enough in the background to keep from detracting from the power of his voice.  I believe \\"Oceano\\" will become one of those songs that are collected multiple times in the future.<br /><br />The second song on this CD belongs in a movie or a play.  \\"My Confession\\" has those elements that long for a pivotal romantic scene to complete the choreography.  The song certainly has the power to stand on its own, but I immediately think of the scenes between Conner MacLeod and Heather MacLeod in \\"Highlander\\" and think of how this song could have led up to the Queen song \\"Who Wants to Live Forever.\\"<br /><br />The third song is \\"Il Postino,\\" a lovely Italian song that I am clueless in understanding, but Groban sings the song so beautifully that I am instantly caught up in the emotions he places into the song.  Joshua Bell's violin is featured prominently in this song and is an awesome enhancement.  Be prepared to put yourself deeply into this song.  I like the following song, \\"Si Volvieras a Mi,\\" which loosely translates to return to me.  However, as pretty as this song is, I think that this song would have been better positioned before \\"Il Postino.\\"  This song is a bit of a let down after the previous song, and could have helped the build up to the previous song.<br /><br />Groban seems to be quite at home with romantic music, and \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" is a simple middle-of-the-road pop tune that Groban could do in his sleep.  While I object to the term \\"filler,\\" this song is much less than the average song on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Per Te\\" is almost as much above average as \\"When You Say You Love Me\\" is below average.  This song has a lot of drama and sweeping moments that provide an operatic flavor.<br /><br />\\"All Improvviso Amore\\" is Italian (I think), but sounds like pop rather than classical or opera.  Yet another song stylistically similar to the previous song is \\"Broken Vow.\\"  Both songs have moments of bombast in the second half of the song.  These are two very light and mellow pop songs.<br /><br />I am unsure of what Groban was trying to accomplish with \\"Caruso.\\"  The song is mellow with few of the heights that I would attribute to Enrico Caruso.  If Groban's intent was a muted tribute to the great singer, then he succeeded.  However, since the song is sung in Italian(?), I am unable to discern his approach.  The song finally scales some heights for about 15 or 20 seconds in the last minute of the song, but once again I am unsure of Groban's intent.  Groban's voice has the power to create a much stronger tribute to Caruso, so the song comes across as a lament rather than an operatic tribute.<br /><br />As much as I like some of the earlier music on this CD, I am positively wild about \\"Remember When It Rained.\\"  Groban uses his voice sparingly and well, imbuing the song with emotional power.  This song has a perfect combination of music and vocals, and is one of my favorites from this CD.  \\"Hymne a l'Amour\\" is a very good follow on to the previous song.  The mellow tone of this song building to the soaring vocals at the halfway point makes this a nice transition song.<br /><br />This song begins with a Celtic flavor.  \\"You Raise Me Up\\" borrows styles from folk music.  The song has lovely piano and violin music in the transitions between the choruses that will likely make this song another favorite of musical collections.  I was hoping this song would keep that simplicity to theend, but about halfway through the song the music and vocals become unnecessarily dramatic.  Just because Groban has the vocal power to sing dramatically does not mean that every song requires such drama.  In fact, Groban proves this with the final song, \\"Never Let Go.\\"  This final song sends chills down my spine, and is my favorite from this entire CD.  In this final song the musical style departs from the formula used in many of the other songs to tantalize us all with the possibilities that Groban has as a singer and an artist.<br /><br />I always want to believe that every musical artist I enjoy has ever more potential.  In Josh Groban's case, I think the potential is very real.  Josh is still very young, and this CD clearly shows that he has incredible potential in his voice and in his musical styles.  I believe that he will continue to impress us with his abilities, and I look forward not only to his next CD, but to what happens as his voice matures.simplicity to the end, but about halfway through the song the music and vocals become unnecessarily dramatic.

B000001G50|5.0|It is interesting to see the disparity of opinions on Karajan under reviews for this performance as they do reflect many of the prevailing views of audiences as to this style of symphonic interpretation for Baroque chamber works and Karajan in general.  I tend to agree and disagree with both which is the reason why I like these particular performances and find them a treat.    I don't find this 'frost-biting' phenomenon to be unique to Karajan as one reviewer makes it seem as this effect is more a product of romanticizing and symphonizing a chamber piece for more instruments that are almost all entirely modern.  It is therefore a phenomenon to all symphonic traditions and particularly those of Mahler and Wagner which means almost every conventional symphony.  Talk about frosty, try listening to Baroque with Solti after a short time: fossilizing!  It's hard to say which is the best piece here but among the Baroque it is certainly one of the most divine of Bach's 'Air' I have ever heard performed in either symphonic adaptation or traditional chamber performance.  The pace is neither hurried or extended and the strings glide majestically.  His interpretation of Vivaldi's 'La Notte' is also one of the best renditions I have heard even compared to those by traditional groups in terms of the pacing and performance for the flute.  The strings do appear somewhat hurried in parts however but the flute was still divine.  Albinoni and Pachelbel, as with Bach, are simply exemplary in tempo and consistency with the strings.  Gluck's piece is delicate and spiritual while Mozart's 'Serenata Notturna' has a lot of resonance and clarity than most other performances which makes it less mundane than it usually is.     All of the pieces in my opinion are really well done for the most part and exemplary of Karajan and the old school.  The recording quality is relatively good. Again, these are symphonic adaptations and so this is probably not what you want if you're looking for chamber and traditional performances.  There are various groups out there that play more within the traditional parameters for these pieces.  I Musici, The Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trevor Pinnock, Raymond Leppard, and, The English Chamber Orchestra are usually some of the better choices in that area.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|When I found out they were reissuing some of the best albums from some of their best bands on their roster, I knew there was a little more to Roadrunner Records planning to celebrate their 25th anniversary. They were planning something huge. 4 team captains, 56 musicians from 44 different bands, 18 original songs, 1 slamming record. Although at first you might think after reading the info, \\"can't happen.\\" Well, check for yourself. By no means a compilation album, this is a true account of 25 years of musicians that have been apart of the roster past and present. This is amazing, amazing stuff.    Cheers, may you guys at the label keep signing killer bands and putting out amazing metal and rock for years to come.
B00025ETIW|5.0|This cd showcases My Chemical Romance's creativity, talent, originality and risk-taking writing in a complete package-it's full of fast-paced guitar riffs as well as beautiful melodies, humor as well as darkness. The cd shows the duality of the nature of death and the many sides of MCR. Although not all the songs are immediately as \\"catchy\\" as their more widely known songs \\"Helena,\\" \\"I'm Not Okay\\" and \\"Ghost of You,\\" once you have listened to the cd a few times, looked at the lyrics and understood what they are about, you will be blown away at how powerful each song's emotion and message hits you. What I love most is that these aren't the kind of songs that you get tired of after a few weeks of nonstop play-I am usually fickle when it comes to music, but every time I listen to this cd, I get something new out of the experience.  <br />      <br /> I loved \\"I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love,\\" but this new cd is more polished and shows the band's maturation. Personal faves are \\"It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish\\" (it represents the concept of the album the best), \\"I'm Not Okay\\" (who can't relate to feeling different/depressed?), \\"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison\\" (powerful, hint of dark humor, great lyrics/melody), Helena (no matter how much it's played!), \\"Hang 'Em High\\" (LOVE the lyrics, makes me want to sing along everytime, really fast with breaks of slower emotion)...but really, every song is a favorite of mine in its own way, they each stand out really well on their own and amaze me. \\"To the End\\" has great vocal melodies overlapping one another...\\"I Never Told You What I Do For a Living\\" alternates intensely fast vocals with a slower venom-infused, powerful chorus...I could go on and on:) <br />     <br />Even though the cd is part concept album, Gerard Way (lead singer) infuses a remarkable sense of personal attachment and longing in every song-you start to really believe in the story MCR has created in this cdand feel attached yourself to the lovers separated by life/death. The songs are really therapeutic and uplifting despite their \\"dark\\" subjects...This is truly my favorite cd of all time, and I love it so much that I want to share it with everyone!:) <br />
B00007BHOE|5.0|Unless you're a diehard music fan sitting and watching a live dvd can sometimes be boring if all the band does is play but for Slipknot this is not the case. Not only is the music great but the band is just awesome to watch on stage. I've been to a Slipknot show and this DVD really lives up to what a Slipknot concert is all about. From People = S*** to Surfacing the whole DVD provides unforgettable footage from one of the greatest bands of the nu-metal era. Also the DVD includes the rare song Purity which is a great sogn and it's hard to find anywhere else unless you illegally download it.  <br /> <br />Track Listing <br /> <br />People = S*** <br />Liberate <br />Left Behind <br />Eeyore <br />Disasterpiece <br />Purity <br />Gently  <br />Eyeless <br />My Plague <br />New Abortion <br />The Heretic Anthem <br />Spit It Out <br />Wait and Bleed <br />(Sic) <br />Surfacing <br /> <br />***Note there are little bonus footage of Slipknot events through the show so watch the whole thing to see them all. <br /> <br />The Videos <br /> <br />My Plague <br />Left Behind <br />Wait and Bleed <br />Wait and Bleed (animated version <br />Spit it Out <br /> <br />The reason I say that this is the blueprint for all live DVDs is that it is not only a great concert is also doesn't leave you bored for a minute. A must buy for all Slipknot fans and I can't wait to see live foot from Vol. 3.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I originally saw these women perform on PBS as I was flipping channels one evening. I was amazed at how beautiful the music and their voices were. I may be a little biased as I am Irish, and some of the songs (i.e. Danny Boy) are sentimental favorites of my family, but honestly I think the music would be enjoyed by everyone. The music is very haunting and relaxing. Similar in genre to Enya (in fact, one of the songs is Orinico Flow).
B0002IU988|5.0|I was very happy that Alter Bridge was able to put out a debut that was almost as strong as some of Creed's best work. Stapp's departure seemed like Creed could never exist again but it's hard to really notice much of a difference. Open You Eyes and Metalingus are my favorite tracks but this is an excpetionally good album.  If you like Creed or any rock or alternative you should check these guys out. Myles Kennedy is no Scott Stapp but he's a good singer and it's really good for the band that they're not fighting anymore.  <br /> <br />Track Listing <br /> <br />1. Find the Real <br />2.

B000002C25|5.0|I became a die-hard Oasis fan after getting \\"Definitely Maybe\\" from my local library and falling in love with it. It has since become one of my top 5 albums ever, but Be Here Now is my 2nd favorite release of theirs. Yes, I know what you are thinking...this man is the only person in existence who likes BHN more than WTSMG. Not true. I love them both equally, but BHN has a special place in my heart. I don't really understand why so many journalists/critics/fans think of this as a \\"letdown\\". It contains at least 5 of the best Oasis songs ever (Stand by Me, I Hope I Think I know, D'you know What I Mean?, All Around the World, It's Gettin' Better (Man!!)). In fact, the last 2 are some of the best songs ever made. Seriously. Here's the truth folks: Oasis has never made a weak album. Some are better than others (the first 3-all masterpieces) and others have some weak songs (Standing on the Shoulders of Giants and Don't Believe the Truth - though both are still outstanding).
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Really good for what it is. I think a lot of people were surprised when a Guns 'n Roses compilation came out. Argue whether or not this compilation was needed,as some people have been saying that this compilation wasn't needed when others said that it was--but while I put this compilation down in my previous review of it,I came to realize what it is and then began to realize that while this isn't a five star compilation,it still is pretty good for what it is. Read on for my review of this:  <br /> <br />If you are a new or casual fan of Guns 'n Roses and you have heard some of the negative things old GN'R fans have been saying about this compilation,let me get those two concerns out of the way for you if are/were wondering about them.As mentioned above,this is a hits album,which strictly focuses on the songs Guns 'n Roses had that were hits(\\"Welcome To The Jungle\\",\\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\",\\"You Could Be Mine\\",etc.). As a matter of fact,most of Guns 'n Roses' hits are here,and the only original GN'R tunes on here that weren't hits(but were released as singles)are \\"Civil War\\" and \\"Yesterdays\\". The reason why songs like \\"My Michelle\\",\\"Used To Love Her\\",\\"Locomotive\\",among other Guns 'n Roses songs like those ones(again,songs that were fan favorites but not hits)aren't here isn't because the compilation producer of this CD got lazy while compiling material for it,but just because they didn't belong on a Guns 'n Roses greatest hits album that had already been planned to be strictly a hits album that focused only on the fan favorites that were hits;not the fan favorites that weren't hits. The sound on all of the tracks has been digitally remastered,so if you buy this compilation and let it serve as your introduction to Guns 'n Roses,you can hear several great Guns 'n Roses songs...sounding even better than they did when they were first recorded! That covers the good parts of this compilation and why this compilation is pretty good for what it is;now let me cover the two thingsthat are keeping this from being a five star compilation:  <br /> <br />TOO MANY COVER SONGS:While I disagree with some people who say that this isn't a good compilation,I do agree with the people who say that there are too many cover songs(\\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\",\\"Live and Let Die\\",\\"Ain't It Fun\\",\\"Since I Don't Have You\\",and \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\")on here. Knockin',Since,and Sympathy are all very good covers and belong on this compilation(especially since Knockin' and Since were hits and really good covers,and having Sympathy on here was a smart move,considering the fact that before this CD came out,to get Guns 'n Roses' cover version of that song,you had to search out the \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" soundtrack to get it,but now you can get it on a Guns 'n Roses CD or just download it off of Itunes if you don't want this whole album),while Live and Ain't also proved to be good covers,they still do not belong on here. Live should have been left out in favor of \\"Estranged\\" off of \\"Use Your Illusion II\\"(one of the best Guns 'n Roses songs and one of the greatest songs ever written) while Ain't should have been left out in favor of \\"Nightrain\\" off of \\"Appetite For Destruction\\"(not one of the best known Guns 'n Roses songs,but a charting single,and what about \\"Oh My God\\",the song the new line-up of G&R did for the film \\"End Of Days\\" that is on the EOD soundtrack and the long awaited \\"Chinese Democracy\\" album and can also be downloaded off of Itunes)?  <br /> <br />NO LINER NOTES:This is what surprises me the most about this compilation. With Guns 'n Roses being a band that left behind some songs that proved themselves to be one of the best and one of the most important hits of rock 'n roll and eventually got left in ruins(not the songs,Guns 'n Roses,just so you don't get confused),you would think that someone like David Wild would be hired to write a biography about Guns 'n Roses for a possible booklet accompanying this compilation that would not only a G&R biography in it,but would also have pictures of G&R,list every line-up of Guns 'n Roses(about four or five line-ups,including the new GN'R line-up),have a discography section of the booklet,and list what Guns 'n Roses albums the songs on here originally appeared on)--but in this instance,that's not the case here. I know that's a little flaw,but a booklet accompanying this compilation(not a huge one;similiar to the booklet accompanying Van Halen's two disc greatest hits set \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\" and the booklet accompanying Motley Crue's \\"Red,White and Crue\\" two disc greatest hits set)would have helped make this compilation really good...  <br /> <br />And all of the things mentioned above is pretty much all you need to know about this compilation. If you are an old fan of Guns 'n Roses and you already own the original GN'R albums,then it really is up to you whether or not you purchase this compilation. If you are a new or casual fan of Guns 'n Roses,then this compilation should do a pretty good and decent job at introducing you to GN'R--if you plan on getting the original GN'R studio albums and are thinking about getting this CD,then you might want to just do that and then decide whether or not you want this compilation(just because of the GN'R tunes that got left off of here that a lot of GN'R fans really like;even if some of those songs weren't hits)but if you are a new or casual Guns 'n Roses fan and you want your introduction to GN'R to be stricly with their hits before you become acquainted with the GN'R tunes that were fan favorites but not hits,or songs that were both hits and fan favorites)then this compilation should serve you just fine.
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I've heard so many good (and not so good) reviews of this, I've been teetering between either buying or renting. Well, I just bought this and wait until you see the packaging - there's actual blood sealed inside the front, clear cover and it moves all around!! Not only that, but there's a minature saw blade that moves too. It defintely pushed me over the edge. Hopefully the movie is as good (especially \\"uncut\\") and creative as the package it came in. I'll know soon enough. If only more studios had it in them to be this inspired (and willing to spend the cash).

B000035Z3K|4.0|The original film, replete with it's amazing cinematography, is rendered even more so with the addition of the newly commissioned soundtrack. I cannot believe how well it fits with what is seen. It is amazing. Fans should buy this unquestioningly. Just do it. Watch it on as large a screen as possible. On a technical note: while originally filmed in a 1:37:1 aspect ratio, using the zoom mode on a widescreen set yields a very acceptable (although cropped) re-framing. BLAH!
5550155184|4.0|In his final agonies, Jacques Saunieres takes a tour of the Louvre. Then, contrary to everything you learned about physiology, as he dies he aligns himself in the pose of one of Leonardo da Vinci's best-known images. Accompanied by invisible written messages. That a person with a bullet in his guts would find these tasks impossible is irrelevant. This is a conspiracy thriller and you must set reason aside. Saunieres' posture, various leavings around the Louvre, including the messages, and the fact that he has a granddaughter named Sophie [\\"wisdom\\" in the event you've forgotten your Antiquities 101 course] are all part of A Grand Scheme. Or Schema. Or something. Whatever it is, Brown gathers some obscure mythology, some devious plotting, some innocents abroad and weaves them all into a fast-paced, exciting story of plausible scenarios. Pick it up and it will remain open until you close the final page.<br /><br />American Robert Langdon, an antiquarian from Harvard, is brought in to explain the messages [nobody bothers to explain about the physiology]. Then, to keep the plot moving, Langdon's charged with Saunieres' murder. The real murderer, however, is more than just elusive. He's a monk. An albino, a feature which should make him glare like a torch to observers. Silas the Silent gets about like a wraith, fed the information he needs to accomplish his tasks by the Teacher. The Teacher is an obscure figure, communicating only when he wishes and remaining well apart from the activity. Is the Teacher a key figure in this tale? Is the Teacher THE key figure in this imaginitive story? You betchum! But his identity remains securely stowed away until the final chapters.<br /><br />Any story starting in Paris is bound to lead elsewhere with most authors, but not this one. Even with plots and conspiracies involving the Vatican and antiquities' scholarship, this account takes two sidesteps to Castle Gandolfo and one to near London. We aren't allowed in to any of the Italian museums. We learn something about the title's namesake, but only what is needed for the conspiracy to unfold. We never even make it to Harvard. However, in a bizarre jaunt, Brown conveys us to Scotland! What on earth is pertinent to Leonardo da Vinci in a remote town in auld Caledonia? The Grail! So, instead of Indiana Jones grubbing in the deserts of Arabia for the Grail, we have a Harvard academic and a goddess of Wisdom poking about in the stones near Scone in the age-old quest. It's good Grail fare. These days you can plunk the Grail down anywhere on the planet and make a story of it. And Brown has done just that. It's a good read and raises some interesting questions. But you have to leave your credibilty at the entrance to the Louvre. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]an museums.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater 3x and that is not something I normally do!  The music and the story just captured me unlike anything I've seen in my life.  Owning it on DVD was an absolute must of course -- Gerard Butler as the phantom is soooo awesome, I would definitely say this might be more of a chick flick as I've never met a guy who didn't laugh about this movie.  Myself, I've cried at the end every time I've watched it!! If you're into gorgeous music and an unbelievable love story with rich and beautiful images, I highly recommend this!!  I am also a piano player and bought the sheet music and play all the songs, in addition to having the CD soundtrack.  Andrew Lloyd Weber is a genius!  I guess you could say I'm a little obsessed but I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  One of my top 10 of all time!!!

B000B5IPLK|5.0|In this industry full of velvet voices and artists unable to deliver the same energy or voice quality off the record, it is rare to stumble upon an artist that actually sounds better live than the produced cd itself.  Alicia Keys is soulful, experimental, and a musician.  This woman is hyped, but can live up to all the buzz once she opens her mouth and her fingers hit the keys.  On \\"Unplugged\\" the familiar hits are there, all rearranged and have a new freshness to them, as she puts twists and turns in the songs that almost make them feel as new songs.  Her voice is as raw and soulful as ever and the guests on the cd only compliment her and at times just make us see, why she is where she is at today.  Her talent is limitless.  This \\"Unplugged\\" album puts to shame those artists out right now who would never be able to step up to the plate, stripped off the equipment that makes them \\"talented\\", it only adds to the true legendary iconic performers who have taken the challenge and performed on MTV Unplugged.  This album will not disappoint, Get yours now!
B000002JKA|5.0|...and their best ever. \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" ALONE is enough reason to buy it.
B0000062S0|4.0|I really expected this to be a horrendous belly-flop; instead, it turns out to be the best post-Led Zeppelin team-up that's been released so far. Probably in deference to Plant's decreased vocal chops, the frames of reference here are more HOUSES OF THE HOLY and PHYSICAL GRAFITTI than LED ZEPPELIN I or II, but that's a good thing. It gives both Plant and Page a chance to stretch out on their mysterioso sides and not stay so much on the crotch-rock postures that haven't worn well over time. \\"Shining In The Light\\" and \\"Most High\\" are the best of the bunch, to my ears at any rate, but everything here adds new lustre to the music which, oddly enough, seems uniquely these guy's turf and no one else's. I've been playing this endlessly for two days in the car and it still sticks to the ears. Real fine!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've never been a Green Day fan.  In fact, one could say I hated them.  Back when Dookie came out, my roommate at the time would listen to it non stop and sing songs from it all the time and it drove me nuts.  I suppose I was pre-programmed to hate them from the beginning. <br /> <br />Over the past few months, I've seen more and more of them and saw their performance at Live 8.  I thought their performance of American Idiot was kind of neat as well as their version of We Are the Champions.  I thought to myself, \\"Okay, so they are not as bad as I thought\\" but never went any further than that. <br /> <br />Over the past few weeks, \\"Wake me up when September ends\\" has been running through my head for some reason.  I went to iTunes music store and downloaded it and found myself really enjoying it.  I listened to a sample of some of their other songs and they seemed interesting as well.  I eventually downloaded the entire CD so i could listen from start to finish. <br /> <br />WOW.  I'm totally blown away and I have been gushing about how great this CD is to all my friends.  There's really not a single song I don't like.  I'd give a list of highlights of some of my favorite songs, but I'll end up listing the full track list.  Jesus of Suburbia deserves special recognition as being one of the best songs I've heard by anyone in a long time.  Brilliant. <br /> <br />I've seen comments like \\"Most people who listen to AI can't even name other songs from their other CDs.\\"  Count me as one of those people, but is this a problem? No.  I think any artist would be more than happy for new fans to appreciate their music.  People should understand that music is not about money as it is a desire to express.  I'd think the more people that connect with an artist reaffirms why they exist in the first place.
0307276902|5.0|This book is about what the worst case scenerio would be for an alcoholic, addict and criminal.  I, too, have to compare James Frey to Augusten Burroughs.  He has a real and true style of writing and I thought the book was excellent.  I could not put it down.  The part about the dentist office made my teeth hurt!  I am just so glad he is still writing, because it means he is still alive! Highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about addiction or just enjoys reading true stories that read like a novel. <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|5.0|I liked it alot, it kept moving, had some action, and a human side as well, and didn't rely on technobabble. The actors were great, and the script was a plus. Since SW. and ST. are gone now this series would be a good choice to fill the void with a couple more movies like this.
B0006GAZLW|5.0|As someone who learned to play the guitar by playing this guy's licks and solos, this Japanese, mini-lp replica version of his best work is a real treat.  Not only do I like the packaging, the remastered sound is very good indeed and is the best possible recording other than perhaps the SACD version if you actually have the required equipment involved that is out there.  With George Martin, the Beatles' guru at the helm, the master must have been great to begin with.  His work on \\"She's A Woman\\", \\"You Know What I Mean\\" and \\"Freeway Jam\\" has become legend and some could even say guitar standards.  This album opened the eyes of many guitarists out there and has been influential in the careers of countless guitarists, myself included.  Everyone from Brian May of Queen, Jimmy Page, Joe Satriani etc have all cited him as a major influence at some time or another.  A constant innovator from the strictly blues repertoire of the Yardbirds to the early Jeff Beck Groups to the hard rock of \\"Rough and Ready\\" to the Jazz tinged rock of this and the follow up \\"Wired\\" to the industrial techno of \\"You Had it Coming\\", this guitarist continues to explore new boundaries.  If you are looking for Jeff at his best though this album is it and if you want the best sounding disc in this mini-lp format, then this one is it.  Highly recommended and essential listening for guitar students.  If you like what you hear and want to explore more, Jeff's other classics are \\"Truth\\", \\"Wired\\", \\"Rough and Ready\\" and \\"Guitar Shop\\".
B0006A9FMI|3.0|I saw this amazing film on DVD and marveled at both the amazing visuals and truly annoying subtitle track. However, it looks like this was an accident:  <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />Dreamworks is offering a replacement program for everyone with a disc that has the English SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf & Hard of Hearing) track instead of a normal one. <br /> <br />Now, if only, they'd replace the insert with professionally-done case graphics... Seriously, I'm a professional designer (the kind schooled in the Swiss Grid, etc.), and this looks like it was done by a teenager in Photoshop for $20. It's amazing that a huge company like Dreamworks could devote so little money to this release.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I really have to thank a friend of mine for getting me in on the Sin City scene, after loaning me the first installment of the comic series, 'The Hard Goodbye', I was hooked and immediately wanted to see the movie.  Fortunately, he had the DVD, borrowed it to me, and I sat down for the ride of a lifetime.  From the opening scene the film is arresting and hypnotic, the imagery used by Rodriguez in bringing Frank Miller's 2-dimensional comic into a 3-dimensional realm is absolutely perfect, especially crediting the select moments in which the film was translated into a streaming animated comic-like appearance.    The opening scene already features two very accomplished actors, Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, and was shot even before the actual film was greenlit.  This scene was shot without Frank Miller's concent in order to persuade him into allowing a full-length feature to be made, and thankfully it was a success.  The finished product was something that I believe comic fans and movie-goers alike will find mind-bogglingly stunning for years to come.  But they won't have just this film to chew on, Sin City 2 has already moved into pre-production for a release date sometime in 2006, while yet a third installment is to follow in 2008.    Sin City focuses on the tales of three separate people, dealing with their own problems on the filthy streets and back alleys of Basin City, where crime is the law, violence a sport, and murder a means of survival.  The first full story centering around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking volatile Spawn-like figure goes on a murderous rampage to avenge the death of the only true friend and lover he ever had.  The violence is prominent, and the Kill Bill-stylishness of it all just makes you want to go back and watch it all again.  The second story follows a calm but insane and mysterious nightowl by the name of Dwight, as portrayed by Clive Owen.  Out of all the characters in this translation, he played the role with such ingenuity and twistedness.  This guy doesn't take crap from anybody, especially the two-timing infectious smug hot-headed cretens who get their kicks off of smacking women around and treating them like their own personal playthings.  The third and final tale (which begins before Marv's story and is continued after Dwight's) introduces us to Detective Hartigan, a good cop with a bad attitude and a real problem with authority, and on top of that, a heart condition.  But that doesn't stop him as he sets out to protect 19-year-old Nancy Callahan from the twisted clutches of Senator Roark's pedophile son, who has now become a disgusting, stinking yellow pervert.    Be warned, parents.  Sin City is very violent, so this isn't a movie you should be taking your kids to.  While some of the content is implied rather than over the top and in your face, it still does go, well, over the top, which is why the adult audience will get more out of it.  Hollywood is becoming quite overrun with tame PG-13 action films all centering around some low-rent deadbeat who loses his family and has to quote un quote \\"make them pay\\".  I won't lie to you by telling you the concept of revenge isn't beneath the surface of this film, but what I will tell you is this isn't just high-flying martial arts kick-to-the-face action with little blood and no pain to teach a lesson.  This is raw, bloody and extremely violent.  The bad guys are always getting limbs severed, ears shot off, hatchets to the nuts, what have you.  This movie is far from tame and it's far from PG-13.  I will say that some of the action is somewhat exaggerated, but that's the entire point.  You have to let yourself go with the flow and enjoy the comic-to-screen dynamics which are put forth here.  The dialogue, action, angles, shots, even atmosphere are all captured exacting to Frank Miller's original comic series, which is what most film adaptations are missing these days.  It just isn't bound by the laws most action films are, it really lets go and takes you on one heck of a wild ride.    As if the main characters weren't enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, there is an enormous all-star support cast featuring Jaime King as Marv's lover, the mysterious and hypnotic Goldie, Nick Stahl as the twisted Yellow B@st@rd, and let's not forget Elijah Wood as the cat-like cannibal martial-artist Kevin.  I'd just like to take a moment to point out that while Wood didn't exactly match the appearance of Kevin from the comic (i.e. in the comic he was taller, not as clean-shaven, etc.), he was still just damn cool to watch.  Now that I see him on screen and playing this character, it's hard to think anyone else could fill the spot, he did a flat-out awesome job in bringing the character to life, and this is a role that I will always know and respect him for.    Other supporting actors feature Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, and Devon Aoki.  Even most of the smaller roles are portrayed by relatively known people.  I don't know if I've ever heard of another film that had as many accomplished actors as this one, and it just goes to show you how much of a fan base this kind of film really has, and how it continues to draw fans from around the world.  I know I'm one of them.  Fan of the comic or not, if you like murder, revenge, blood, violence, action, and dark humor, this is your kind of movie.

B00005JMEW|3.0|In 2004, Hollywood was full of controversy, from the Bush-bashing film \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", directed by the gelatinous Michael Moore; to Mel Gibson's Biblically accurate epic \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"; to the ultra-violent \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" and \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" from cult favorite director Quentin Tarentino.  Even though all of these films were controversial in the public and media's eyes, though who really cares about anything Michael Moore does, and personally Mel Gibson's movie was not controversial for any reason, that is unless you don't believe in God.  The only film(s) that was controversial to me was Quentin Tarentino's ultra-violent, `Kill Bill' 2-part series.  Initially the movies were intended to be just one long film, except after test audiences felt the movie was too long after clocking in at around 4 1/2 hours, director Quentin Tarentino felt it best to break them apart into 2 films.  This decision was probably wise for two reasons, one is that audiences wouldn't grow tired of sitting, and second, it allowed for more money to be made off of this new franchise.    \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" begins the story of vengeful character known as, `The Bride' (Uma Thurman).  During her wedding rehearsal `The Bride' and her husband-to-be are going through the motions of the wedding when a team of assassins enters the small church and slaughters everyone in sight.  The slaughter, was ordered by the leader of the assassins, a man named Bill (David Carradine), who just so happens to be the former lover and mentor to `The Bride'.  After surviving the slaughter and awaking from a long coma, `The Bride' begins her quest for vengeance, by killing every member of the assassin squad, until she reaches their leader and gets the opportunity to `Kill Bill'.    As I said, out of the big three movies of 2004, the `Kill Bill' series were the only controversial ones, and that was only because of how unapologetically violent and depraved they were.  Truthfully, all the people whowere upset over the violence in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\", but were ok with the violence of \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\", need to have their heads examined.  In \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" the violence is the only thing propelling the story forward, truthfully there isn't much of anything compelling in the basic plot of the film to drive this movie at all.  Whereas, in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" the violence, though realistic compared to `Kill Bill's' over-the-top bloodshed, is not the main focus of the movie.  The main focus is Christ's final 12 hours on Earth, and what He went through to redeem humanity from itself and the love He had for all of us, instead of the mindless, quest for vengeance with elaborate death scenes that was featured in the popular phenomenon that I will never understand, that is \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\".    As a whole, the movie \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" was ok, it wasn't terrific, and truthfully I don't see what all of the fuss over it being one of the greatest movies of all time is all about.  But even with my gripes aside, I have to admit the acting was great, the story was somewhat weak, but the actors all made it work for them, which helped tremendously.  The action was energetic and entertaining to watch, but was over-the-top and somewhat redundant in places.  I must qualify these statements though, I am not a real big fan of Quentin Tarentino's work, I thought \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" was good, but I wasn't impressed with \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or \\"Jackie Brown\\".  If you are a fan of Tarentino then you will probably enjoy \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\", and more than likely will be among the many that felt it was one of the best movies ever made.    Overall, \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" isn't the greatest movie, but it's not the worst either.  It's at least worth seeing both \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" and \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" one time.    \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Subject says it all. Joss Whedon is an amazing writer.  This series has a great cast, is extremely funny and great plot lines.  The movie Serenity was amazing and I hope they bring this series back because of it.

0441012906|5.0|Alastair Reynolds has a way with worldbuilding that will draw you in like no other.  I expected this book to disappoint me (because it wasn't set in the Revelation Space universe), but after an admittedly rough beginning, it completely sucked me in.  It's a fascinating and well-told story set in as fully realized a world as any he's created before.
B00015HVI8|5.0|I was recently turned on to the Stargate SG-1 series by a friend... while I'd seen a few episodes and liked what I saw, I didn't really know the concept behind the series.  As I was going to have major surgery which would lay me up for a couple months, I ordered seasons 1 through 5, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  After the ascension of Daniel at the end of season 5, I just had to continue to see what happened and I didn't want to wait for reruns, so I ordered season 6.   <br /> <br />The very first thing I noticed was a substantial improvement in quality!  While 1 - 5 looked great, season 6 looked spectacular, almost HDTV-quality.  The only thing I can attribute it to was the fact that SciFi channel had taken over the series and was perhaps filmed in HD for future broadcasts. <br /> <br />Anyway, I've just gotten started on season 6 and like what I see so far, in both picture, sound, and story quality.  In fact, I like it so much I've bought season 7 as well!

B00003CXHJ|5.0|This has the feel of the older sub movies with a newer feel. Remember Torpedo Run, Run Silent Run Deep? Well this is right up there. Great DVD extras on the making of and history of the Enigma  Machine. A US sub desguises it's self to look like a German sub so they can pose as a resupply sub to a disabled German sub in order to capture the Enigma Machine (a device that encrypts info so no one else can read it) Things go horriably and a handfull of people are left to carry out the mission. This is a great movie, can't say enough about it. Don't just rent it, Buy it.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|Constantine is a movie that I believe you will have to be a genre fan to enjoy. There are several inside jokes and pokes at other sci-fi movies, not to mention comic book theology.  <br /> <br />On the whole, the movie does take itself seriously, but I believe that's what makes it so campy and fun.  <br /> <br />After the movie was over, I spent my time watching the 2nd disk commentary, and then watched it again. As you can tell from what I'm writing, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br />But as I said in the title of my review, you're either going to love it or you're going to hate it. If you're a sci-fi/religious fan, I'd recommend it. If you're a general audience type person who wants to know what the hubbub is all about, you might not necessarily enjoy it as much. <br /> <br />Is Keanu Reeves' performance as monotone as it is in every flick he does? Sure. Does it really detract from a fun movie? I don't think so. <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars, because frankly it's not a perfect flick by any stretch. But it's good popcorn fare, and the special effects are absolutely KILLER. <br /> <br />I hope you enjoyed my review.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This series on DVD is just unreal great. This is something that no DVD collection can be complete without it. It is kinda like a documentery on WWII but you will relate and have favorite actors. I've never seen such a movie I know that it's kinda pricy but I've had it for 4 months and I think I've watched it about 5 times (the movie is 11 hours long in it's entirety) I very highly reccomend it.

B00006879E|5.0|I really enjoy this cd.  I have a lot of cds that I like only 1 or 2 songs and end up hitting the skip button for most of the cd.  I've found that I can pop this cd in and listen to the whole thing while my husband and I are cooking dinner or just hanging out.  If you like the few songs they play on the radio, you'll like the rest of the cd.
B000007MVL|4.0|I have read many negative reviews of this album, saying it lacks the musical progression, of say 'Never For Ever' to 'The dreaming,' or that 'Lionheart' does not match the consistent quality of all  the songs from 'The Kick Inside.' Yes, this can be viewed as a patchy album, but it would be patchy when given just under 3 months to create and produce, as well as organise a show-stopping, highly influencial tour at the same time. And still, with just 3 months to do so, Kate has given us another album of breathtaking originality, that no other can possibly imitate, (as many have certainly tried.) Furthermore, given that many of the songs on here were written pre 'Kick Inside' ('Hammer Horror', 'Fullhouse')just adds another level of excellence to it.

B00006L7XQ|1.0|I've been a fan of Johhny Cash for over forty years now, listening to and buying his songs from time to time.<br /><br />So, based on the other laudatory reviews, I ordered American IV.<br /><br />I listned to it this afternoon and was very sad, listening to this man whose voice and songs had enthralled me for years struggling to catch enough breath to sing those ragged notes. One of the reviewers sad that he never had much of a voice and thus the ragged pain of this performance was OK. I disagree, Cash  had a vibrant moving style that that was deep and gravelly voice that could and did carry the melody faithfully and tell a story with energy and pathos. This was a very sad performance of a man I would rather remember in his prime not in decline at the end of his life. I miss Johnny Cash, but, I'll take a pass on this album.
0321213351|4.0|I found this book to be very readable.  It combines refactoing and patterns.  The refactoring shows how to improve existing code in order to improve maintenance and start on the road to patterns.  I find the ideas can be used in practice and a group of us are using the book to see how we can improve the code base.  The book makes extensive use of ideas from the Martin Fowler book, so it may have helped if I had read that book first.  The examples tend to be small subsections of java code and you see how to change by applying a series of refactorings.  Sometimes the examples seem to jump so a little larger examples would have helped.  I liked that the examples are taken step wise so you can see that the code can change in an evolutionary manner.I would recommend this book for anyone doing software development.

B00003BDXG|5.0|Natural Born Killers is a cult leading film. Filled with action, great acting, killer scenes and awesome music. A story of love and chaos.

They fall in love and together they murder Malery's family and start their life together as serial killers on the run across america experiancing a new life full of murder, drugs and full blown chaos.  <br />  This is a amazing story written by Quentin Tarrentino, excuse my spelling, and directed by screen writer of scarface the well respected Oliver Stone. This movie is a trip to watch with the camera magic and psychodelic scenes that make you feel like your one something. Truly a must, no movie collection will ever amount to anything without a copy of Natural Born Killers.

B00008OLIO|5.0|Motley Crue's \\"Too Fast for Love\\" (1982) is one of the band's finest albums, as well as one of their most overlooked. Originally released independently in 1981, the album was remixed and released the following year on Elektra Records. Although the Crue wouldn't break through and hit it big until the following year with their landmark \\"Shout at the Devil,\\" (1983) \\"Too Fast for Love\\" remains a cult/fan favorite.<br /><br />\\"Too Fast for Love\\" does and does not have the Crue's sound that most people are familiar with. \\"Too Fast for Love,\\" although quite pop sounding at times, does not sound like a pop-metal album, the way their other 80s albums do. While it certainly has the classic Motley Crue sound and feel; these songs sound rawer, more punkish, than the bands later work. Overall it is the band's least commercial, least polished album. Comparatively speaking, \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is like a diamond in the rough.<br /><br />While \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989) is a great album, no doubt, the songs are sophomoric and tailor-made for MTV. Although \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is a definitive album from that era, it's somewhat contrived. \\"Too Fast for Love,\\" in contrast, sounds far more dangerous, genuine, and lived in. When the band recorded \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" they were complacent multi-millionaires and on top of the rock world. When the band recorded \\"Too Fast for Love\\" they were struggling and hungry. The songs on \\"Too Fast for Love\\" reflect that.<br /><br />While most Motley Crue albums have four or five very strong songs, with the rest being good, but not great, every song on \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is memorable and well written. As the clich&eacute; goes, it's all killer and no filler. Calling \\"Too Fast for Love\\" a pure \\"punk\\" album in the truest sense of the word wouldn't exactly be accurate. But there is definitely an element of punk to the album. It's probably most comparable to Generation X or Billy Idol's early solo albums. In other words, it's not hard-core punk, but assessable punk, with a fair amount of pop-content.<br /><br />On thing that immediately strikes the listener is how young and hungry the band sounds. Motley Crue never sounded as good as they did on their classic debut. They really sound like their ready to take on the world.<br /><br />These are Nikki Sixx's best penned songs. Although always a gifted songwriter, on subsequent albums he would at times try too hard, or try to embrace a trend. There is nothing contrived or pretentious about \\"Too Fast for Love.\\" The songs are genuinely dangerous and come straight from the heart.<br /><br />Vince Neil sounds fully fearsome, an indisputable street punk. Mick Mar's playing is top-notch and gives all the songs a real vitality. Tommy Lee's solid pounding is stellar as always, even when he was just a kid.<br /><br />\\"Live Wire\\" is probably the most well-known song on this disc. Fast and furious with a great hook, it's a good way to start off the album. The up-tempo \\"Come on and Dance\\" is one of the album's more popish songs and keeps up the momentum. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" is one of the Crue's most underappreciated songs. Fast and highly melodic, it's an anthem that epitomizes youth and rebellion. The album slows down a bit for the bleak \\"Merry-Go-Round.\\" Young and poor at the time, when Vince Neil asks \\"am I going down?\\" he meant it, which makes the songs sound all the more real. \\"Take me to the Top\\" and the Motley staple \\"Piece of your Action\\" are fast paced and infectious. The strength in the former is its melody, and the strength in the latter is its fierceness. \\"Starry Eyes\\" has an almost hypnotic intro and a haunting chorus. The album's title track \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is another anthem, akin to Skid Row's \\"Youth Gone Wild,\\" which was recorded almost a full decade later. The grand finale, mini-epic, tragic \\"On with the Show\\" is a perfect way to conclude the album.<br /><br />I really don't have any bones to pick with \\"Too Fast for Love.\\" From start to finish, the songs are all superb. Althoughnot as well known as some of the bands later work, it surpasses much of it. \\"Too Fast For Love\\" stands besides \\"Shout at the Devil,\\" and \\"Motley Crue\\" (1994), as the band's edgiest, most genuine, rocking music.<br /><br />The reissue of \\"Too Fast for Love\\" has many bonus songs that should be of interest to fans. The upbeat \\"Toast of the Town\\" and the popish \\"Tonight\\" are up-to-par with the rest of the album's songs. It's great that they have finally seen the light of day. The mid-tempo \\"Stick to your Guns\\" is good, but not quite as strong as the other tracks. \\"Too Fast For Love\\" with the alternative intro is cool, and is a nice bonus.superb.

B000AL730O|3.0|Aside from the most embarrasingly corny 1800's flute solo in English Tea that makes me feel like i'm marching with George Washington maybe a bit TOO much, this is a pretty good record. Having grown up listening to the Beatles in my dad's record collection, there is a certain nostalgia that comes with his voice. However, i've yet to really like much of anything after Wings. And even with that, i'm a wayward fan.  I love what Goodrich did with Radiohead and Beck so i was pretty sure i could trust the collaboration. I think for the most part, i was right. I love the slower moody songs. I was never big on his sappy happy's but... they're still good. I heard Jenny Wren and i was sold. Haven't bought Paul's solo stuff in a long time. Actually... ever. I have Beatles records and thats it. Confident i'd enjoy it, i gave this one a chance without even hearing much of it. Its still got some clunkers (and that flute solo) but more often than not, i like what i'm hearing.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|It's great to have all these songs on one cd. \\"Savory,\\" a Jawbox with the band Far, is an incredible song. Great stuff and brings back fond memories of the Deftones/Far tour. I feel bad for the Duran Duran tribute album; Deftones' version of \\"The Chauffeur\\" is the only piece of gold on that crappy album. Thanks to this album, no one has any reason to buy that pop-punk mess. \\"No Ordinary Love\\" is beautiful; they really took a song that helped define one artists and made it theirs without insulting the original artist. Samething with \\"Simple Man;\\" I still felt the old school Southern Rock vibe, but the Deftones definately took this song and made it their own. Boy, the Deftones know how to cover a song. <br />Why isn't this album four stars? Well, check the title of the review. \\"I Can Barely Breathe\\" was from the Escape from L.A. soundtrack and is vintage Deftones. Sadly, it's missing from here. \\"Teething\\" is such a brilliant song and I am really bummed it didn't make this album. Here's hoping it will show up on the Greatest Hits; it belongs there. If you haven't heard either of these songs, go get 'em!  <br />Otherwise, this is a great album.
B000002GYI|5.0|Kraftwerk had put out albums before but none with short popish songs.  The previous albums were long concept albums.  Computer World came along and slapped the New Wave world up-side the head.  You could listen to it, dance to it, and count along with it.  This album created more electronic genres than you can shake a stick at.  I played it for a younger friend of mine that listens to trance and he came back and said that he could here the same stuff that the new guys are still playing. <br />If Kraftwerk hadn't made this album then the world would be a much different place.
B00006FM77|3.0|I have mixed feelings about the remastered re-release of the 1971 mega-album \\"Chicago: Live at Carnagie Hall.\\"  First, the original was famously flawed (even the band didn't like it).  While I agree that much of the performance is raw and exciting, the recording was sub-par on most songs and awful on a few.  Sad to say, I don't find the remaster to be much of an improvement in that regard (a re-MIX might have helped, but if something's recorded badly to begin with....) <br /> <br />Then, too, producer James William Guercio famously accused the band of being \\"drunk and sloppy\\" through much of the week-long engagement.  On a few tracks, it's obvious he was right.  The set sold a ton, though, and it's only right that Chicago fans have access to it today. <br /> <br />I've always like a few things about it.  The extended guitar solo at the end of \\"South California Purples\\" is absolutely EXCELLENT, as is the extended version of \\"Free.\\"  Too, I've always like James Pankow's solo on \\"Mother.\\"  I was excited to see a bonus disc for this version because \\"Listen\\" has always been one of my favorite CHI tunes (the almost half-speed version turned in here was, as such, a letdown), and Lamm's \\"Nasaltones\\" composition contains enough interesting chord changes to make me wish he'd used some of them in a tune. <br /> <br />Overall, with the reproduction of the original packaging and the memories it brings back, the set is worth owning.
B000001C6M|5.0|The production on the album is a little substandard, but the musicianship of Kerry King and Jeff Hannaman on this album are on point.  They were the first death metalists to focus on songwriting in my opinion.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|I bought this BEFORE reading the reviews. As I sat here in horror I considered the \\"car cd player\\" scenario since this disc is obviously thicker... *runs out to car* ... *comes back* ... the dual disc works great, the thickness is no trouble at all (I have a Panasonic, \\"Run of the Mill\\" player) Yeah you have to be conscious of not scratching the top, but that's OK.     Now for the music. Wow. Just Wow. I haven't enjoyed a Priest CD since, believe it or not, Defenders of the Faith. I knew in my heart they'd be back and for the most part they are. Sadly, in Priest fashion there are only 10 tracks and the last 4 songs are really a mixed bag... but then again there are the extra bits on the DVD side. I really didn't care for the \\"speed metal/trash era\\" like Hellrider seems to portray, I like fast, but not \\"fast for the sake of fast\\", there is a difference.    You MUST buy this for Judas Rising, Deal w/the Devil, and Revolution if nothing else!! Major props to Roy Z on the production it really is fantastic!! Unlike a Brave New World (Maiden) which really didn't work for me, I can say without hesitation... Judas Priest is Back!!    My assessment: (this actually comes out to 3.4 stars I think, but then I factored in the \\"Halford Factor\\":)    Judas Rising; 5 stars  Deal w/ the Devil; 5 stars  Revolution; 5 stars  Worth Fighting For; 3.5 stars  Demonizer; 3 stars  Wheels of Fire; 4 stars  Angel; 2.5 stars  Hellrider; 1 star  Eulogy; 2.5 stars  Lochness; 2 stars
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not having seen the series when it was aired on Fox, I caught it on the SciFi channel and was hooked right away. I wanted more. Firefly has the personal honor of being my first TV DVD set. This is science fiction, but it is not the \\"geeky\\" scifi. It is a western, but it is not Bonanza in space. It is the perfect combination of character driven story, witty banter and action to make it one of the best TV shows. <br /> <br />I recommend this DVD set to any one who wants an escape for 40 minutes. Once you watch the first one, you will be hooked, gauranteed.
B000002U82|5.0|There is no doubt, this is the best PF album. I like this album so much because it's their best! I was a bit skeptical about buying this album (because everyone knew about it) but i loved it!<br /><br />SPEAK TO ME/BREATHE IN THE AIR: 10/10: Slow drumming, clocks, cash registers and other stuff make it cool.<br /><br />ON THE RUN: 10/10: A good keyboard song, with one riff repeated over and over really fast, and evil laughs and so on. I love it. Best song when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />TIME: 10/10: Classic. I like the \\"Breathe\\" reprise ath the end.<br /><br />THE GREAT GIG: 10/10 A great song with spooky voices in the beginning, then orgasmic screaming and so on.<br /><br />MONEY: 10/10: Don't give me that do goody good bullsh**! I love this song.<br /><br />US AND THEM:10/10: Best song on the album.<br /><br />ANY COLOR YOU LIKE: ??????/10: Nuff said.<br /><br />BRAIN DAMAGE: 10/10: GReat. Reminds me of \\"Wizard of oz\\".<br /><br />ECLIPSE: 10/10: I love this song.<br /><br />SO go buy this cd!
0425188809|4.0|The only reason I won't give this five stars is because I've grown weary of the plots revolving around a troubled man, a woman, and some dog (ussually a golden retriever). Also, through no fault of Koontz's, certain aspects to the book are rather dated. Like the whole U.S. vs. U.S.S.R angle, and and some of the references to 80s technology.  <br /> <br />However, when the dog tells Nora that he would \\"Die of Lonely\\" without them, it had to be one of the most touching moments I've ever read in any novel. <br /> <br />How did this dog communicate with these two indivuduals? You're just going to have to read this book to find out. <br /> <br />\\"The Outsider\\" also reminded me of KMFDM's \\"Beast\\", which isn't necessarilly a bad thing.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|On her first album I gave it a three star rating(or was it two?) <br />Isaid that I could only hope that she could grow as an artist. And I can say with confidence after over a year since this release, that she did. <br />More highlights than her first album. More range of songs and yet holding a theme of carrying sounds from the soul of decades past.Better writing. This album is superior to her first in almost everyway. While I easily got tired of \\"Fallin\\", I don't think I'll easily get tired of great tracks like \\"You don't know my name\\" or \\"Karma\\". So here's hoping to a really good career. <br /> <br />
1400095913|4.0|\\"What was sleep, after all, but the process by which we dumped our insanity into a dark subconscious pit and came out on the other side ready to eat cereal instead of the neighbor's children.\\" - Dexter Morgan<br /><br />The world is singularly lacking in individuals worthy of hero worship. Or maybe I've just gotten cynical. However, there is a surplus of sociopaths, violent psychopaths, and generally sick puppies.<br /><br />Kudos, and 4 stars, to author Jeff Lindsay for creating in DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER a most unlikely hero, or at least protagonist, in Dexter Morgan, a blood splatter expert for the Miami Police Department, who's also a serial killer exercising his own brand of vigilantism. His victims - 37 to date - are those that society would perhaps like to see dead anyway, e.g. pedophile priests, child rapists, and at least one \\"mercy killer\\" RN. Dexter's modus operandi is to vivisection them to death. Nice.<br /><br />Here, Dexter is faced with a serial murderer of prostitutes whose method mimics his own. Morgan is torn between helping his foster sister, a Miami PD vice officer, catch the monster to jump start her stalled career and bonding with somebody who's obviously a soulmate. Wouldn't it be nice to work on some poor unfortunate together?<br /><br />In a world bereft hero figures, I'm left to seek them in fiction. Despite Lindsay's inventiveness, I don't see why I should have to adopt one whose elimination from the human gene pool would be so desirable. So, four stars to DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER notwithstanding, I don't intend to continue with the series.
B00005JOM9|5.0|The main character, Bree (Felicity Huffman), a week before her sex reassignment surgery, is forced by her therapist to fly from LA to New York to bail out of jail the 17 year old street hustler son, Toby (Kevin Zegers,) she she had been unaware even existed. They embark on a cross country road trip filled with self discovery, wry comedy, and pathos. The plot line is the tried and true formula of the transformational road trip, yet the irony of Bree's concurrent sexual transformation freshens a story that could easily have been clich. <br /> <br />Kevin Zegers and the rest of the supporting cast are superb, but Huffman's characterization of Bree is Oscar caliber.  <br /> <br />Transamerica has been making the film festival circuit, winning awards at the Berlin Film festival, the Tribeca Film festival in New York, and the Frameline International Gay and Lesbian film festival in San Francisco.  <br /> <br />Obviously a labor of love, Duncan Tucker wrote, directed, and wisely cast Felicity Huffman as Bree (before she had been cast as a \\"desperate housewife\\"). Huffman's husband William Macy is executive producer. <br /> <br />The Weinstein brothers recognized just how outstanding this indie is and have slated it for December 2, 2005 limited general release--one of the first post Miramax films to be released by their new company.

0156027321|2.0|I rate this book a two because I had mixed feelings about the book. I found Part I extremly boring and disappointing. Part I did not strike a bit of intrest in me. Honestly I didn't want to hear about his desire to combined three different religions. I found that irrelevant to Part II and III of the book. Yes there was some relevance but not as much as there should have been, especially since the first Part was about him and his religion. Part II was a hook I found it extremly interesting. Many of the fantasical events in Part II changed my feelings towards the book completly. Pi's story was just amazing. The idea of someone being stuck on a boat for 200 something days with a bengal tiger is fantastic. Survivg in a life boat for that long is incrediable. Who wouldn't want to read about such an amazing story of survival. After Part II I was confident that this book was one of the best I had ever read, then the book eneded terribly. At the very end of the book you are lead to believe that the whole book was a lie. Pi gives you two different stories; the one with suriving on the boat with a tiger and the other one was about him surviving completly on his own, after the murder of three other surviors. I absolutely hated the ending it makes the book almost worthless to read. The ending was so disappointing and it ended leaving you wondering which story was true. The ending allows you to make the story what you want to make it and I honestly hate that. So I give this book a two because of the terrible beginning and ending.
0385507755|1.0|I don't believe most of what this homophobic, misogynistic, egoist writes.  Not only that, but what he writes and the devices he employs in his writing are cliched and REALLY unnecessary.  Someone should tell this reject that random capitalization and random line breaks make a good book do not.  But by sales figures past, present, and future, people take this crap at face value and worship before the altar of James Frey (or at least he'd have you believe).  There are far more harrowing, realistic, and moving tales of the power of addiction.  Perhaps try William S. Burroughs, Hubert Selby Jr., or as one person noted, DeQuincey's \\"Confessions of an English Opium Eater\\".  Leave this crap on the shelf and don't give this bloated pig of a \\"man\\" anymore of your money.
B00005MP58|5.0|FANTASTIC! Such a great rendition of this classic book... other than a few add-ins (typical to all films made from books), the series follows right along with Jane Austen's novel. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle interpret the characters of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett very well. Overall, a 5-star film!
0689504764|5.0|What I love most about \\"We're Going on a Bear Hunt\\", by Michael Rosen, is that the adventure is being lead by a father!  In this modern era, dads are often left out of the picture (or the picture book).  Yet this book shows the beautiful interaction of a father and his 4 children (not to mention the family dog).  All the members of the family work together to help each other during the adventure.  They aren't running off it different directions, but they all have the same goal.   <br /> <br />But where's the mother?  I'm assuming dad gave her a much needed break, and she is off enjoying some quiet time somewhere.  And dad used the opportunity to take the kids on an adventure! <br /> <br />I suppose the moral of this story could be that we need to face our issues head on instead of going around them, but when I'm reading this book with my three boys, I'm not thinking of any grand moral to be taught.  I am just enjoying the time with them, as we embark on an exciting family adventure like no other!
0553573403|5.0|This is the real deal.  More action than any fantasy book I can think of (or any type of book once I think about it).  Please don't read this and complain about too many characters, too many plots and subplots, going for chapters before a character shows up again (if at all).  Emerse yourself in the story and the world that Martin has created.  The main characters come to life on the pages as you dig in to this series.  More twists and turns than a grande prix.  Don't read anything else until you read this series.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home, which I watched last night, provided an absorbing three and a half hours of insight into Bob Dylan's early life and his emergence into prominence and controversy in the mid sixties. I mention the duration of the movie because I can rarely sit and watch for so long without my attention wandering. Not in this film. Before remarking on the content of the film, it is worth considering Scorsese's direction. I recommend this film to anyone interested in watching or in making documentary film. The way in which archival material, concert footage and interview segments are integrated and paced is masterly. The film really tells a story and creates an atmosphere: I felt as though I was there. Scorsese's experience in making feature films has enriched his direction of this film. Although comparisons are silly, it may be his best film. It sent me back to The Last Waltz for comparison of his method.<br /><br />The film's most valuable asset is Dylan's own recounting of his past, and the most striking point about it is how much interview time in Dylan's early years was wasted in asking often trite questions of this most intuitive mind. He rarely answered them, and often could only express his irritation of the questioner. Scorsese's film of the contemporary Dylan rarely presents the questions, content to record what he has to say. Hibbing, Minnesota is stripped bare. Even Dylan's evasiveness, when dealing with his more questionable behaviour to friends and colleagues, is revealing. There is a conflict between Scorsese's intention to make a coherent narrative and Dylan's lifelong habit of crossing borders and categories, throwing dust on his trail and refusing to be pigeonholed that adds an interesting tension to the viewing.<br /><br />The main thrust of Scorsese's film is the impact of Dylan's crossover to electric instrumental accompaniment. Listeners then had become divided into self perceived groups, the folk 'purist', social conscience type and the mindless consumers of pop pap who just enjoyed the music, and Dylan outraged everyone by moving between these groups freely. His motives were neither pure nor particularly self aware. From the perspective of our own times the differences between these types of music seem less extreme: both were commercial entertainment; listening to a protest song was often a substitute for more committed action. Yet at the time the difference was important to those who were there. From the conflict that ensured, the boos and the cries of traitor, there would emerge something new in pop culture, the pop music artist, and Scorsese doesn't let us forget it. One disadvantage to this emphasis is that it focuses on the same period and phenomenon as Pennebaker's Don't Look Back, which is even quoted in Scorsese's film. The Pennebaker film (a masterpiece) has been available on DVD for some time, and most watchers of No Direction Home would be familiar with it (note the similar inspiration between the two titles).<br /><br />The film reveals Dylan's background, and then moves on to an overview of the music he grew up listening to, from Hank Williams to Muddy Waters, fascinating to those interested in developments in popular music. The society of Dylan's youth is sketched in vividly: Cold War, Greenwich Village, the folk music scene, the civil rights movement, the birth of folk-rock. The controversy over Dylan's move to electric instruments in the mid 60s is shown through concert footage. We see the Dylan who found, used and then dropped Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez and many others. One comment, that Dylan was like a sponge, reminded me of a similar comment about George Gershwin, who absorbed, or 'stole' elements from all the popular cultures of his time. But transformed them. This was the Dylan who became, unexpectedly, a pop star, who poured out a stream of literate, introspective pop lyrics which made pop culture 'respectable' to the intellectuals and had a transforming effecton the way popular music was presented by other artists. In a way Dylan could be said to have re-invented pop music in this period.<br /><br />So, everyone has his Dylan. In the 60s Dylan was for some The Genius; for others he was The Poet; for others again he was The Traitor. These are all projections of our own that tell us what we are looking for. No wonder Dylan dodged like crazy. Today if you become a star you deal with it by making it a persona, or you self destruct by taking it all seriously. Dylan survived because he had many personas. This film is Scorsese's Dylan. We'll never know Dylan's Dylan.<br /><br />Scorsese's film covers the period 1941 to 1968, when Dylan suffered injuries in a motor cycle accident when he was about 26 years old. Therefore the film does not deal with a lot of important things about Dylan: his marriage and family; his influence on popular music, especially on the Beatles; the literary value of his song lyrics and his stature as probably the greatest of popular song writers; his use, even quite late in his career, of traditional melodies (which is common folk practice); the creation of country rock; the disintegration and self healing recorded on Blood on the Tracks; his various religious affiliations; and his non musical activities such as paintings and novels. If anyone reading this knows Martin Scorsese would they ask if a second film is going to be made covering this material? Probably the elusive Dylan would consider it too defining and completing a study to be made in his lifetime, but you can only ask.effect on the way popular music was presented by other artists.

B00080Z53O|5.0|If you can get past the argument about euthanasia, you can enjoy a touching movie about one man's battle for years to die with dignity.  Based on a true story, Ramon Sampedro had a life-altering terrible accident as a young man when he took a dive into the ocean, just as the undertow took the water away.  Frightening, the consequences led to his pariplegic state and confinement to a bed for the next few decades.<br /><br />Winner of numerous awards, including Best Foreign Film at the 2005 Oscars, Goya Awards, and Global Awards, you might recognize Javier Bardem from \\"Mondays in the Sun\\", and  \\"Before Night Falls.\\"  The leading lady, Belen Rueda, is one of Spain's popular TV personalities.  Bardem, at the time of filming was only 35 and with excellent makeup, he was made to appear 55, the age of Ramon Sampedro.<br /><br />A story of love, death, life, dignity and freedom.  There are those who love him enough to help him and those who stubbornly challenge his right to die.  Embarking on a journey, fraught with legal hurdles, in between, he embraces his dreams of flying beyond his window to the beautiful see he loved.  Flying over the sea is symbolic of freedom of life without constraints.<br /><br />If you are new to foreign film, you will see that this has clearly labeled subtitles, a great benefit to your movie pleasure.  Another important feature is the commentary by the director!  Always give time to observe with great attention, the commentaries! ...Rizzo.

B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD concert was excellent! The visual was amazing! I saw a portion of it on PBS and decided to purchase it so I could see it in it's entirety.  My 6 yr old daughter loves it too and is always singing the songs.  We also bought the cd to hear those angelic voices in the car. I would definitely recommend it especially if you enjoy Enya and the like. I am not a music critic,just a regular person who found this DVD performance to be quite enjoyable.
B0002OERI0|5.0|God, why is everyone so stupid? Everyone's like: \\"They're  <br />getting old, I like they're older stuff.\\" It's so stupid. They <br />have gotten older. Everyone at my school says: \\"Oh, I like they're older stuff.\\" Oh my God!! The kids at my school were either babies or not even born yet during they're older stuff!! <br />      Here's my review: <br /> <br />I give this CD 5 stars because it's a great CD. It's fun to <br />listen to loud, and is very addictive. You probably want to <br />say that I don't know they're old stuff, since I'm a kid.  <br />But, I do know they're older stuff, and I even have Dookie memorized. Why does everyone keep saying they wear Hot Topic clothes? I went to Hot Topic once (it's a stupid store) and I didn't see the clothes that they wear. I give  every song 10/10 <br />because all the songs are really good. They don't all sound the same, either. My favorites are: Give Me Novacaine, Letterbomb, <br />WMUWSE, and Whatsername (the best one). My guy friend hates Whatsername, because he's an idiot, but I still love him. <br />I don't care what you morons say, but Billie Joe is hot. This <br />is the last time I read these reviews, they aren't going to change my mind, and they just find ways to criticize the guys. <br />A lot of you morons will think I'm stupid, but no, it's really you. Hopefully, some smart person will agree with me and find this review helpful. By clicking no, you're saying that you're freakin stupid, because you are. This CD is way better than they're older stuff. By the way, if you hate this CD, why are you even wasting your time making reviews on it?? I only want to read the 5 star reviews. Anyway, I like how this CD tells a story of Jesus of Suburbia, St. Jimmy, and Whatsername. All the songs make sense together. I hope that their next CD continues that story, though, everyone will think that it's getting old.  <br />
0307276902|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. No matter if you have faced drug adduction or not, this book will keep you in it the whole way through. The style of writing really makes you feel like if you were in the rehab facility watching the whole thing. The story is definatly the best memoir I have ever read.
0060987464|4.0|I loved reading it - very engaging, definately a book that's hard to put down. As far as content, the literary style shifts quite a bit near the end, with more interviews and tour journals (so the narrative you see in the preview is not the complete picture). Overall I think it's a good buy, and, although definately not the complete story of Marilyn Manson, gives you good idea of what he's really about.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|the beautiful painting on this cover, which could resemble a young boy riding a horse through a grove of trees or a slender man making his way through them on foot, is telling of the music contained here. \\"Takk...\\", the new offering from Sigur Ros (pronounced see oor roce) is the exact opposite of it's predecessor. Where 2002's ( ) (aka untitled) was a dense journey through ice and fog that could very well define the term \\"glacial\\", \\"Takk...\\" is a more linear focused work and it's clear from \\"Glosoli\\" (the album's second track) onward that there was going to be a punch about these songs. It should be said that every track on the album is still exceptional (as is the Sigur Ros standard), but these songs while they can work as a continuous movement are just as lovely taken alone. The thing that made \\"Untitled\\" exceptional as a whole is absent here, being replaced by structure unique to this album and submitting to it as the thing that makes this also exceptional. Another thing about \\"Takk...\\" is that it's been said this album was sung in a discernable human language instead of the improvisational style of ( ) (Untitled) that was designed to highlight the wonderful quality of the human instrument. Most listeners in the northern hemisphere (outside of Iceland) will not be able to tell a great difference for the simple fact that the Icelandic on \\"Takk...\\" sounds just as lovely and strange as anything sung on \\"&Aacute;gætis Byrjun\\" or \\"Untitled\\". Very seldomly can one thoroughly enjoy music sung entirely in a foreign language (discernable or not) as much as with Sigur Ros. The sorrow, pain and joy that they deliver transcends barriers and is very accessible to human ears regardless of culture or language. This could be the greatest strength of Sigur Ros and what they create.<br /><br />Their most recent, \\"Takk...\\" is a stunner and it may well be their most exceptional effort. This is because not only is it pristine and gorgeous but it actually injects some raw power which gives them even more depth and makes this something that's rewarding almost beyond words. In the year 2005, nothing that was released was better than this.even more depth and makes this something that's rewarding almost beyond words.

I've recommended it to other moms of adolescent girls, because it presents an excellent message about the superficiality of \\"beauty\\" and how society defines it- in a very absorbing, fun-to-read novel. I'll be surprised if this book isn't made into a movie!
0380789019|5.0|Here Neil Gaiman has created an enjoyable and just slightly disconcerting novel for anyone who likes dark fantasy, and especially anyone wondering if there's more to life than a stable, dependable existence. Office dweeb Richard Mayhew has a pretty good life with a lucrative job and a pretty fianc&eacute;e, but it turns out that the job is boring and unfulfilling, and the fianc&eacute;e is coldhearted and manipulative. Richard helps an injured girl on the street and is transported into the (literal) London underworld, the abode of odd folks and creatures who have fallen through society's cracks. But these are cracks in society's memories and beliefs. It's a world of strange magic and dark threats, where Richard slowly transforms himself from dork to hero. But will he truly be happy returning to his old life, which was stable but unfulfilling, or will he choose to stay in the lost world where he's a hero among forgotten dregs? Gaiman has created an engaging society of misfits and magic, with unique and intriguing characters who bring out a true appreciation for the worse things in life. [~doomsdayer520~}

B0000025DD|3.0|Pink Floyd fans will buy this album anyway, not least for Gilmour's uniquely haunting guitars solos.   <br /> <br />The rest will find this album to be a easy, pleasing listen - nice melodies with simple and occasionally wistful arrangements.  Gilmour's soothing vocals and his thick, sustained guitar notes lack the polish and verve of his work with Pink Floyd. His lyrics, even with help with a number of people, are mundane and can never compare to Roger Waters'. <br /> <br />Yet this album has that ineffable thing called 'feel', and it will render many enjoyable listens.
B00001P4RI|5.0|Brendan Perry, in his first and only solo effort to date, continues his magical musical odyssey strengthened in the goth-folk presence of Dead Can Dance.  Standout tracks include \\"The Captive Heart\\" and \\"\\"Death Will Be My Bride,\\" both excellent reflections of an uncanny ability to bring myth and melody together: linking DCD songs like \\"Severance\\" and \\"American Dreaming\\" to the forefront of this song cycle of Perry influence with the stripped-down ambience of guitar, drums, and synth.  A must for any Dead Can Dance fan.

Seems to be a lot of value for the money. <br /> <br />Pros: <br /> <br />Great range on 1.6x crop sensors (45-216mm equivalent on 35mm format) <br /> <br />Image Stabilization - I don't know whether it can get you two stops but I know it works. <br /> <br />Fast/Smooth/Quiet Focus with full time manual. <br /> <br />Crisp Images throughout entire range (may have something to do with the 1.6 crop sensor of the Rebel XT, no soft edges) <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> <br />Image Stabilization sucks down the battery quickly. <br /> <br />A bit on the bulky side, especially when mated to the small body of the Rebel XT.  I also bought the Battery Magazine for the XT which makes this lens more balanced. <br /> <br />Expensive - but a very good value for the money spent. <br /> <br />Construction - when extended beyond 35mm the end has some wobble to it. <br /> <br /> <br />Summary: great lens for the money (not a little), glad I bought it.  Would have gotten 5 stars except for the construction (end wobble).
0446310786|4.0|The book, To Kill a Mockingbird, really made me feel lucky that I was born in the time I was. Back then in the 1930s, blacks were treated badly just for the color of their skin. Nobody cared about them. As for the whites, some found it hard to live that kind of lifestyle, just like the main characters, Jem and Scout, two siblings living at this time. They live in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. The town seems very boring and desolate. It also seems like they are stuck in a bubble, not able to get out of the town. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by a young girl named Scout who lives during the time when blacks and whites were segregated. Her father is a lawyer and he is often made fun of because he defends black people. Later in the book, he has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is charged for the crime of rape of a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout. He raises him with their cook, Calpurnia. Atticus teaches Scout everything. He tells her, \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\\" She remembers this especially in the end of the book. Atticus says a lot of important things such as \\"There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son. I wish I could keep 'em all away from you. That's never possible.\\" He really cares about his children and he wants them to grow up right. <br /> <br />One summer, Jem and Scout meet their next door neighbor's nephew, Dill, who comes over every summer. They become amused with the house down the street, the Radley's. They want to see the son who is believed to have stabbed his father with scissors, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. They have a silent relationship with Boo because of the presents Boo gives them in the knothole of a tree near the Radley house. The presents that he gave them included chewed up gum and figures that looked like them. It was really odd. <br /> <br />When I finished the book and took time to understand the meaning of why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird it all came to me and I liked the book. The book very harsh with racial discrimination, but it is really funny that the children of Maycomb County care more about the blacks than the adults. There are some fun and interesting parts besides the harsh comments, but mainly it focuses on how the past really was. I am still very happy to have been born in the time that I was. You must read this book because it will make you understand the past a little bit better and you will learn from the mistakes people back then made.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I had very little exposure to Sigur Ros before \\"Takk\\" was released.  I knew a little bit about them, and their so called oddities.  I knew they were from Iceland, and nobody could understand (in the U.S. at least) what they lyrics were.  So this is not a cd I ever expected to purchase.  That being said, I consider myself very fortunate that I came across it, and had a chance to listen to it straight thru, thus gaining a full appreciation for the band, and what they do.  I'm slowly warming up to their earlier albums, but can't picture anything topping the beauty and sublimeness of Takk. <br /> <br />If I could sum this up (which is very hard, mind you) I'd describe Sigur Ros as an electrified Enya, with a touch of Bjork.. which is crazy, because I can't stand Bjork (but do love Enya!!).. anyways, the music is gentle, melodic, and sweeping at times.  Most songs on Takk run past 6 or 7 minutes, but in a way that doesn't give you the feeling of the song being overextended.  Many people would have a hard time believing this band is made up of men, not women.  The voice is truly angelic, and can put you to sleep if you're not careful.   <br /> <br />Track 2, Glosoli is a definite standout (with a great video if you get the chance to see it).  Track 3, Hoppipolla is probably the most upbeat track on the album, and hits you like a fresh wind after being underground for a month.  Track 6, Saeglopur is one of the best.  It's haunting, and very hard to explain.  Track 9, Andvari is simply a beautiful song.  Not my favorite after my first run thru the cd, it's now by far my favorite. <br /> <br />This cd leaves me confused, happy, and longing for more in life.. it's hard to explain, and I think anyone who has this cd would agree with me.  It's a must have, no doubt about it.
B0009JAENU|5.0|At first glance seeing Hilary Hahn and Natalie Zhu on the cover of a CD of Mozart Violin Sonatas seems like a nonsequitor.  Hahn is a very popular violinist but more closely identified with the big Concerto repertoire than with Mozart pieces.  But with age comes greater appreciation of the early important works of the masters and that seems to be the case here (and who can forget her recording of the Bach solo sonatas and partitas?).<br /><br />Though more often heard in the scaled down sound of Mozart's period with the pianoforte substituting for the contemporary piano,  here Hahn and Zhu find the beauty of tone and warmth of phrasing and textures that fits these sonatas very well indeed.  The sound Hahn produces is absolutely glorious: she frolics through the playful A Major Sonata, K. 526, dances with the lightness of  the  G Major K. 301 and  F Major K. 376 sonatas, and yet plumbs the sadness of the Sonata in E Minor K. 304.  The two artists are perfectly paired and their years of collaboration clearly shine in this very clean recording.  It is a welcome gift for Mozart's 250th birthday! Grady Harp, October 05
B000002W9P|3.0|Before you all ripp my head off over that rating, understand that i am a Helloween fan as well as you are. Even for my favorite bands, i still have to be critical with them. <br /> <br />This was my first Helloween album when a then freind gave me a old cassette copy of it in the 8th grade, needless to say, that was a very long time ago. I literally thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, listening to it on a almost daily basis. I never knew music THIS good could come out of a country like Germany. Sure, there were Scorpions, but they became way to commercial and Americanized for my tastes, and Accept were nothing more then AC/DC clones. But THIS was a whole new form of musical perfection for my then young ears. For a while i thought *Keeper of the Seven Keys* PT 1 was utterly flawless and unbeatable and that nothing could be as good as this.... <br /> <br />Then Keepers PT 2 entered my collection. <br /> <br />It thought utterly destroyed PT 1 as far as i was concerned, which i didn't even think was possible. A little older and wiser now, with almost every Helloween album in my collection, i can see PT 1's shortcommings pretty clear now. For a band like Helloween, this is an extremely SHORT album. It only clocks in about 36 minutes or so, and thats even including tracks 1 and 7, which arn't even songs at all. It has about 4 qaulity songs and one really exellent song. I think it is a good album, don't get me wrong, it is just that it is not up to the level of godliness that is PT 2. PT 1 is like reading the first few chapter of a really good book, good, but it leaves you hanging at the end. <br /> <br /> Track 1  <br /> 2/10  Nothing special, just a pointless horn section and intro to the next song. <br />  <br />Track 2 <br />8/10  A exellent power metal song and great start for the album. <br />  <br />Track 3 <br /> 9/10 One of the coolest songs they ever wrote, great lyrics but the chorus sounds like it was sung by kindergarteners though. <br />  <br />Track 4  <br />7/10 I used to skip right over this song all of the time, but it ended up growing on me. <br />  <br />Track 5 <br /> 3/10 &lt;A Tale That Wasn't Right> Uhhg!, a sleepy balad, i ALWAYS skip over this one! <br />  <br />Track 6  <br />7/10 &lt;Future World> I always thought it was just a little  overrated in my opion. It sounds way to bouncy and cartoony for me, think if Mickey Mouse and Goofey and the gang formed a metal band, it would sound like this. <br />  <br />Track 7  <br /> 10/10 &lt;Halloween> Best song on the album! Helloween's trademark song which goes over 13 minutes. This is so good, the lyrics are about October 31st and it almost borders on progressive rock territory. pure rollercoaster ride metal. <br />  <br />Track 8   <br />1/10 &lt;Follow The Sign> Utterly pointless and g@y. Just some arabic sounding guitars and some guy whispering \\"Follow the Sing!\\" for about a minute and a half. <br /> <br />Good album, just not great, nowhere near Keepers PT 2. If you are just discovering Helloween though, it is a great album to begin with. Just maybe if they had put more material on this, i would like it a little better.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />
B000089RVX|5.0|While I enjoy my classic rock music, there are a few new bands that come out that grab me. This is one of them. Beginning to end this cd is great. One of the best voices I've heard in a long time backed by a strong band. I'm looking forward to their next releases.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|I had been anticipating this album for a long time and was not put out to pasture and shot because of it.  Instead I was injected with some of the purest Metal steroids on the planet.  Roadrunner sure has come a long way from being a foreign supplier of American Metal to the single most powerful Metal record company on this or any floating piece of rock.  They displayed their dominance with this album.  With never a dull moment to be had this compilation of past and present bands literally kicks the dog piss out of you.  If you have any kind of a pulse that beats Metal then I would highly suggest buying this album before you go flat lined. This album gets two snaps in a row!  End note....
0553573403|5.0|This is a great book. Martin does an outstanding job at drawing in the reader with his careful character development, his care for a good plot and a story that comes across as masterful. The characters are all well developed, and I found myself skipping chapters to continue the thread of my favourite characters (I found I could do this without affecting the storyline - too much). There are many well crafted story lines that make this an excellent read for people who prefer an above average book. The world-building is solid and believable. Martin has the ability to create suspense with mere spectres, and I believe this to be the mark of a great story teller. I highly recommend this and all other books in the series - 3 so far, and one to be released in November 2005. This is a series with promise and for the keeping.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|If you were going to leave ten movies in a time capsule for future generations to see what movies were all about (I know you've played this game before) \\"North by Northwest\\" should be somewhere near the top.<br /><br />I forget where I read this but Hitchcock's resume for films goes back to the 20's when he was one of the early craftsman who worked with a moving camera. You know they did have talkies at that time and drama but up to that point it was all done with a stationary camera.<br /><br />So the old professor really had done it all when he came upon the series of movies which made him famous. This was preceded with the sexy, scary-as-hell \\"Rear Window\\" with Jimmy Stewart, who along with Grant might have been Hitchcock's other favorite leading man. While Stewart (very courageous man but that's another story) lacked Grant's debonaire good looks and savoir faire, he was (Stewart) ordinary looking and Grant on the other hand could play ordinary.<br /><br />Here in NBNW Grant as Roger Thornhill, just on the wagon, obedient to his Mom even though he's in his 40's, gets mistaken for a double agent by the ever sinister James Mason and we're off to the races. We see the old airports, Love Field and the old American Airlines Eagle as Roger and Eve Marie Saint and Mason and Martin Landau chase each other over the 1950 terrain of the USA.<br /><br />The remarkable thing about Hitchcock is his relentless presentation of the average guy caught in events way, way over his head. Brilliant movie. Brilliant cast. Brilliant Director, really, never to be replaced. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
6305428042|5.0|The Sanderson sisters are witches that vowed to come back in the future to steal the the souls of children in order to make them young again. That may sound too scary for children, but this movie blends lots of laughs with that theme. The witches are played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy. These women have wonderful comedic timing and make the perfect trio for blundering evil afoot. Both parents and kids will enjoy this one.
B000002KMY|5.0|Hey Dr. Stein from the U.K., it's good to see that you're into some good groups like Sabbath and Dio, and not just that Slayer crud. When you were refuting my Slayer review you said that Sabbath was the first band that was associated with the devil. I've never thought of them as being Satanic, but they do sound kind of doomy at times. Also, Judas Priest never made a young man put a shotgun to his head and pull the trigger. That young man was sick in the head, and Judas Priest had no culpability in this tragedy. The whole trial was a joke, so you're quite full of s##t. If by calling Armored Saint a 3rd rate band means that they play more melodically and you can understand their vocals and the sound quality is amazingly good and you can tell that each track is completely different from one another, then I love that 3rd rate band!!! Did you know that your I.Q goes down a few points each time you play that death metal crap?<br /><br />Well, enough of my tirade! Let's talk about this very good follow-up to the enormous success of &#34;Heaven and Hell&#34;. &#34;Mob Rules&#34; isn't quite the quality of H&H, but isn't as bad in comparison as some people have said. I've come very close to burning out on H&H, but don't seem to tire of &#34;Mob Rules&#34;. That's probably because I have played H&H so many times more than MB. Still MB is one of the all time great metal albums. Don't listen to Dr. Stein's mediocre review. Every song is a 8/10 or higher on this great metal offering. The only &#34;filler&#34; track would maybe be &#34;Over and Over&#34;. On &#34;H&H&#34; I really loved &#34;Walk away&#34; and I thought the track &#34;Lady Evil&#34; was the filler track. I kind of wish that the album would have been recorded more brilliant and clean sounding than it was. Sometimes it sounded like it was recorded under water or something. It's really a shame that Dio didn't stay for more than two studio albums, but the two he made were pretty extraordinary in my eyes. Just disregard what Dr. Stein from the U.K. has said and buy this superb metal offering from the metal masters Black Sabbath.rd what Dr. Stein from the U.K. has said and buy this superb metal offering from the metal masters Black Sabbath.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Certainly a rock star, certainly a musician still pushing the envelope, Plant comes forth with an intense and new level of . . . hell, it's rock n' roll.<br /><br />I think that there are those far more accomplished than I who can tear down (not put down) this stuff. I can't. But like the great jurist who said of the 1st amendment and its violation, \\"I know it when I see it,\\" I know rock n' roll because of what it does and where it takes me.<br /><br />My sibs and I were raised on Classical Music. See my reviews on Mazur and Solti and Bernstein. But we were born at a time when the Variety Top 40 was in vogue, and then along came this explosion of different sounds from Crosby and Stills, arena bands, the Tops and the Temps, the Commodores, Steve Winwood, the guys from the UK, Mama Cass, Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company, Bob Marley and all the rest. It never stopped. And there were voices. Incredible voices. Stills. Bob Seger. Lennon. Garcia. Lennox. Chrissie Hines. And then there was Plant and the Zeppelin. Unbelievable.<br /><br />Plant has always meant innovation. Zeppelin itself was taking rock not to a new level but to a new direction. He is the Magellan of rock, taking us always on his circumnavigation around the world.<br /><br />You need to listen to this a dozen times. You get something new each time. Great rock n' roll at a time when there's good music . . .it just seems less diverse. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury
B000063DHL|5.0|\\"Somewhere in Time\\" , coming after \\"Powerslave\\" and before the mind blowing \\"Seventh Son\\" album, continued the epic fantasy metal Maiden excelled in and took it to the next level. While most people  rest this on the shoulders of the introduction of guitar synths that are omnipresent here, Maiden's sound had a more sweeping sound to it , if you will. The sounds seem to have a little more muscle than most of \\"Powerslave\\".The guitar syth defenatley did have a very important role in the album though , as the full on synthesizers are used beautifully on the next album, 1988's \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\". <br />    I have absolutley no complaints about this masterful offering by my favorite band. Though technichly not a full on concept album, Adrian Smith's songwriting on this seems to mostly revolve around the subject of time and the whole thing has kind of a \\"spacey\\" feel to it. The romping , thundering openrer \\"Caught somewhere in time \\" grabs your immediate attention and keeps it for around 6: 30 I believe.\\"Wasted years\\" sweeps you through its entirety, and the wrenching guitar solos on \\"Sea of Madness\\" are one of this albums best moments. Some very cool vocals in the midsection of \\"Heaven can wait\\". 'The Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner\\" is probably the worst song on here , but that is by no means an indication of its quality. Soaring , epic, and awesome intro.You can feel the desolation of the soul lost in time somehere in \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", and \\"Deja Vu\\" pounds away furiously. One of the true overlooked Maiden gems, along with the album itself, is the closing epic \\"Alexander the Great\\". At over 8 minutes  , i have never found myself bored with it. Just a small notch down from \\" Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". <br />    If you are a fan of Iron Maiden, metal ,rock, or good music period , go to your nearest Fred Meyer, Circuit City, Best Buy, Target or whatever emediatley, or just scroll up and click \\" Add to Cart\\". I am 17 years old and this was relaesed in 1986 , so that shows how well this music stands the test of time.Absolutley incredible, do your civic duty to your own happiness and buy it as soon as you can.

In 50 years of watching Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror and loving even the schlockiest of it, I can count the number of times I've refused to watch something on one hand and have fingers left over, but this was one of the worst.  Don't waste your time!

I've never doubted her ability as a vocalist and has been a steady fan since \\"Always be my baby\\" when i bought it on cassette.  <br /> <br />I personally really enjoyed Charmbracelet as well as this album, even though honey and heartbreaker failed my expectation, nevertheless, she's back and i'm so glad that she's still making REAL music, she's invincible and will always be MARIAH CAREY, the NUMBER ONE RECORDING ARTIST IN MUSIC HISTORY! i'm ALWAYS goin to be a faithful MC fan.

0345451325|4.0|When I first checked this book out of a library, I was actually very skeptical. I really expected that any book with the name \\"Halo\\" on it would be a cheesy, half-baked attempt to cash in on the popularity of one of the greatest video games of all time. <br /> <br />Boy, was I glad to be wrong. <br /> <br /> Halo: The Fall of Reach is an AMAZING book. It's very well written from start to finish. There are in-jokes for players of the game (for example, the first time we meet the child who will one day become Master Chief, he's playing King of the Hill with other kids). There are simple back-story elements that are alluded to, but not explained, in the games, including the eponymous fall of the military depot/naval base called Reach. <br /> <br /> There are also some very nice touches, such as one of the absolute best ship-to-ship warfare fights I have ever seen, and some nice geek moments. For example, there's a cool little bit referring to Einsteinian physics, alluding to the Covenant's ability to travel unnoticed through slipspace (I.e., the ships cause so much gravimetric distortion, they appear to be a comet, instead of just several really huge ships). <br /> <br />All in all, I went from assuming I was holding a second-rate tie-in book to being delighted by one of the best sci-fi novels I have ever read. I HIGHLY recommend this work to anyone who enjoys science-fiction and/or good military stories, even if you couldn't care less about the Halo video game!

0393035158|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  He is a very good polemicist, both insightful and entertaining.      I found the chapter about Islam to be the weakest, and not because it was picking on that religion unfairly.  First, it seemed out of context, given the focus of the rest of the book on the United States, and second his view of the west seemed to change in that chapter and it threw me off.  In this chapter, the irrationality of Islam is not viewed in the context of the irrationality of Christianity, but in the context of the rationality of western secular liberalism.  So, rather than saying that the whole world is going crazy and that there is a real problem when you have two major forms of irrationality competing for dominance, that chapter makes us look really good in comparison.    Which, of course, we may . . . but that isn't the thrust of the book.    Harris buried a lot of his more technical arguments in the footnotes -- many of which are wonderful little essays in themselves -- leaving the body of the text as an informed look at this problem rather than an overly academic one.  And the look Harris takes is one which dares to question religion . . . an increasingly rare piece of courage in this country.    Harris is the only person I know of to write about ethics and morality without reference to intentions, thus denying a distinction between torture and accidents.  He gets transparently politicial in a few sections of this book, and you can see the quality of his reasoning change.

0807219908|4.0|This is in regards to the audio (CD) version read by Tim Curry:<br /><br />The story is a psychological drama pitting an evil adult against 3 seemingly helpless children.  As such, it relies heavily on nuance and character interaction to advance the story-line.  Action plays a very small role in this story.  Consequently it requires the listener to pay relatively close attention.<br /><br />I mention this because I listened to this with my two 7 year olds and a my 10 year old.  The 10 year old was enthralled but the 7 year olds didn't quite grasp it fully and were, as a result, less enthused.  Though the CD will make a valuable addition to your child's library, be aware that he/she will have to have achieved a certain level of maturity before it will be fully appreciated.<br /><br />As for me, I found it very entertaining and was pleased that it was not a run of the mill good versus evil story with a pat ending.  And Tim Curry did an outstanding job bringing life to the characters - of special note is the constantly coughing Poe.<br /><br />The only downside - At the end of the CD is an \\"interview\\" with the author that I was unable to get through.  He posed as Snicket's press man and would answer questions about Snicket as posed to him by a reporter.  A bit ridiculous and offering little insight.

B000B0WODA|4.0|Not really a fan of the Good Charlotte, Blink 182 genre, I had mistakenly categorized Franz Ferdinand as another TRL punk-rock band, without ever hearing any of their music. But after listening to \\"Do You Want to\\" on the radio, I couldn't resist picking up this CD. The thirteen uptempo/energetic rock tracks contained do not disappoint, and channel the Cure and the Beatles with memorable tracks like \\"This Boy\\", \\"Evil and a Heathen\\" and \\"Well that was Easy\\". But it is with the album opener, \\"Fallen\\" that Franz Ferdinand really shines, this is one of the most fun and crisp fast-paced rock song I've heard in a very long time..   <br />

0156027321|4.0|Yann Martel's novel begins with an extremely bold declaration; that it is a story that will make you believe in God. Unfortunately, while the protagonist's almost unwavering faith and will to survive are inspiring, the core of the novel is hardly redeemed with its barely-there conclusion. This fantastical tale of a young boy and a comically named tiger trapped on a lifeboat is heartwarming at times, but the novel's unbridled visual imagery is not for the weak-stomached.  All in all, the novel's redeeming qualities most definitely outweigh its shortcomings and even if it doesn't change your mind on God, it will at least make you think a little about survival mentality.
0143034901|5.0|I read a lot, and am always seeking a well-written imaginative book.  They can be hard to come by, but this is one!  Politics, love, intrigue, and the love of books are all factors in this book's plot.<br /><br />The little boy, the protagonist, is one of many characters who goes through all kinds of sleuthing and adventures to get to the truth of who wrote the book that he loves.  In reading about his quest for truth, we read a story in a story.<br /><br />Every character is distinct, and those who surround the history of the book he reads are closely related to the boy's own story.<br /><br />So good, I mailed it to the only person I know who would truly appreciate it.<br /><br />This book is a special find.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|First, for the reviewers that compare the Cream of the 60s with the Cream of today, ignore those reviews. The question should be- 'How is the music?' Well, it's great. The songs are well played by all three individually and as a group. There are moments when you can see they have no idea where they are going, but they make it work because of their individual skills and the fact that they listen to one another (improvisation a lost skill today). Each of them give wonderful performances. Jack's bass playing and singing are tasteful. How many three-piece bands could pull off the performance they give on 'We're Going Wrong', a very simple song? Sometimes, 'simple' is harder to play. Clapton is pushed to play more on the edge than he has in years. He really does benefit from the nakedness of the three piece ensemble. His phrasing and use of space are masterful. Baker plays like no other drummer in terms of his inventiveness. All I can say is that my wife, who doesn't like Cream that much, hates guitar and drums solos sat transfixed watching Baker's drum solo. I kept offering to fast forward through the drum solo, but she insisted on watching it all the through.  She couldn't stop singing 'Sleepy Time' for two days.    Regarding the songs they didn't play, all I can say is that the songs they played were well performed and even provided some surprises. There were some complaints about 'Stormy Monday' being included as it isn't a 'Cream song', well there is a hard to find record of the three of them with Mayall ripping through this song.
B0009S3HI0|4.0|God I was excited when I heard the deftones were going to be putting out a rareties album. I have been a diehard fan for years, but still there are a few tracks off this album I don't have. If you have collected the singles, you wil have a lot of the songs off of this release. For me, the highlights are \\"Chauffeur\\" from the Duran Duran tribute album, and \\"Savoury\\" a Jawbox cover featuring Jonah from the seminal Far. Jonah also appears on the Sade cover \\"no ordianry love\\" and \\"be Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away) (Acoustic)\\" I believe. This version is haunting and beautiful. Originally on the b-side of said single. <br />The majority of the record is pretty strong. So why only 4 stars? well, there are 3 tracks I can think off the top of my head that are missing. <br /> <br />1-To Have and To Hold from the depeche mode tribute album. An awsome track indeed. <br />And the older tracks from soundtracks: <br />2-Teething. <br />3-I can't breathe. <br /> <br />Where are these tracks, chino? there was space on this cd, why were they left off? <br /> <br />overall, lovely packageing and bonus dvd containing some very boring videos. C'mon, I love Deftones, but hteir videos aren't really their strong point. <br /> <br />Weakest tracks in my oppinion are Black moon featuring Cypress Hill vocals (never been a fan) and Sinatra, the Helmet cover. The production on this is pretty dodgy and doesn't really do the original any justice. <br /> <br />I recomend it though. They are still one of the best and most consistent bands around, and this should keep you happy until the new album comes out in 2006.
B000009FGB|5.0|This landmark album by Black Sabbath is the very peak of their collaboration with legendary singer Ronnie James Dio.  While \\"Heaven and Hell\\" is an excellent album for many reasons, I've always seen it as the album where Sabbath worked Dio into the mix and found a new sound post-Ozzy.  On \\"Mob Rules\\" we get a Sabbath that has fully reinvented itself for the 80's with an album that sets a standard that the next generation of metal bands would have to gauge themselves against.<br /><br />Despite my love of Bill Ward's work with Sabbath, drummer Vinny Appice is a fitting replacement on this album.  His drumming style seems to bring out the very best basswork from Geezer Butler and the heaviest riffs from guitarist Tony Iommi.  Under the expert hand of legendary producer Martin Birch, Black Sabbath's power and technical prowess are underlined on \\"Mob Rules,\\" especially on such tracks as \\"Falling Off The Edge of the World,\\" \\"Slipping Away\\" and the upbeat radio hit \\"Turn Up The Night.\\"  There isn't a bad track on this album, and Dio's lyrical musings are actually quite good, even when put up against the canon of Geezer's lyrics during the Ozzy years.<br /><br />If you like hard rock or heavy metal, \\"Mob Rules\\" is a necessary addition to your album collection.  Make sure you pick up the re-mastered edition.  And get yourself a copy of the animated stoner rocker movie Heavy Metal so you can see the songs \\"E5150\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" used very effectively as part of the soundtrack.
B00005R2IS|4.0|This is a strong, exciting story, built from lots of great parts. There's Australia itself: hot, sun-baked, and barely tolerant of the people crawling through it. There's the background situation: almost post-apocalyptic, society hasn't broken down all the way, but it's getting there fast. There's Mel: a good cop in a place where that means being the law more than upholding what's left of it. Then there's the story: biker gang tries to intimidate Mel through his loved ones, but that just makes him angry.<br /><br />It's a bit formulaic, but it's a good formula and executed very well.<br /><br />But I have to keep asking myself - was Mel Gibson ever really that young?<br /><br />//wiredweird
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a good book because even though I didn't really enjoy what I was reading about, it was written in a way that made it interesting.  It sounds like the story takes place in the future.  Jonas lives in this perfect world.  It is a controlled enviornment run by a group of elders.  The book is about Jonas recieving his assignment.  This is the job he will perform for his community.  Jonas recieves a very important assignment and the Giver helps him discover life outside the community.   <br /> <br />(Gabby, ELHS)
6305313687|5.0|\\"American History X\\" can be looked at two ways. (A) A liberating piece of film making which deals with some important social issues in our society today or (B) a piece of (...) that is merely an excuse to see a black man have his face smashed into a curb. I realize, from reading the reviews on Amazon, that people view this film usually from these two perspectives. \\"American History X\\" may be violent (the film is rated R for Graphic Brutal Violence Including Rape, Pervasive Language and Strong Sexuality and Nudity) but despite the reasons for it's R rating and despite the violence used to portray waht point they are trying to get across; American History X is a fantastic film. Edward Norton scored his second Oscar nomination for the film, rightly so, as Derek Vinyard. Derek is sent to Chino prison for three years after he murders two black men attempting to steal his truck. Derek is also the leader of a group of White Supremacists (one of which played by Ethan Suplee).  After getting out; Derek has changed and sees that his brother Danny (Edward Furlong) is following in his footsteps. The script, by David McKenna is right on target in showing racism and the consequences caused by it. The ending is sad & great; but movies are starting to develop a pattern in which the same ending occurs. Norton is brilliant in his role; going from playing skinhead nazi Derek to cleaned up Derek. Furlong is good, but wasn't the greatest choice to play Danny in my oppinion. I'm not saying this one of my favorite movies or even that it's one of the best films ever made; but I think this is one of those movies people should view at least once. A.
B000059TEP|5.0|This movie touches the heart strings - people always have questions about death and what happens after - this certainly gives folks hope.  The storyline is great, and the characters carry the feelings throughout the movie.  A keeper.
B00005JLEX|4.0|Some of the early episodes must be painful to watch for the stars themselves. It's interesting from a character development study over time for hardcore fans but somebody watching fresh for the first time may be surprised at why this series eventually became so popular. <br /> <br />There's not much to the first season - only five episodes. The pilot (the actual series pilot - not the episode the Pilot from season 4) and episode 2 are simply just bad from an acting standpoint. George is the strength of the show and he is probably what saved it from cancellation. But Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine really stumble out of the gate. There's some apparent ad-libs between Jerry and Elaine that fall completely flat and never should have made the final cut. There's some funny scenes in Episodes 3 and 4 and the acting gets a little better. Episode 5 is the first all-around good episode of the series. <br /> <br />Season 2 improves a lot. This is where we see the show starting to take shape. The Pony Remark contains perhaps the funniest single stand-alone scene in the history of the series when Jerry ruins the family get together with his dinner table remark and spends five minutes trying to rationalize his way out of it while his relatives stare at him in contempt. Most of the other season 2 episodes are good with some classics (The Jacket, The Statue, The Heart Attack) and a couple clunkers (The Chinese Restaurant -critics praise it as innovative but the comedy is mediocre - and the season finale The Deal). <br /> <br />The extras are fanstastic and really provide a lot of insight and trivia for long-time Seinfeld fans. <br /> <br />

B00005N56Y|5.0|The whole story of the composers-conductors have not been written may be well considered unfinished if the name of Britten is not included. His approach in what Mozart concerns is a fact worthy of the best and sincere epithets. He added these Piano Concerts not only elegance, cram, noblesse but also aristocracy and refinement.<br /><br />So when the imaginative melodic flight of Britten converges with the wisdom innocence of Sir Clifford Curzon -one of the few artists who \\"made sing\\" the piano- (Wilhelm Kempff was the genuine master in this field),  the result is a true enraptured and inspired Mozart, because as the Great Genius, Mozart 's significance is major by what suggests instead by the expressed.<br /><br />I should remark the special relevance of this CD because both works mean somehow, the alpha and omega of the best set of Concerts of Wolfgang Amadeus: the 20th is to my mind, the most complete and profound of all Mozart piano Concertos. It possesses humor, innocence, tragedy and redemption; all the mythic cycle expressed in thirty minutes.<br /><br />\\"The brevity is the soul of the cleverness\\"<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|Thanks a million for such treasures. Thirty-eight years after John Coltrane's death, it's still possible to discover new music by this master. And what a music!!! <br />Here is the original John Coltrane Quartet,with McCoy Tyner,piano,Jimmy Garrison,bass and Elvin Jones,drums.Shortly after,Rashied Ali would take Elvin' chair in the quartet.The music you'll hear in this two CDs set was taped at the Half Note,a small club in New York City ( with an audience of some 130 listeners;just try to imagine Louis Armstrong,or Duke Ellington,or Count Basie,at the peak of their career,playing for such a small group of persons!!!).The first set (CD n1) was recorded on March 26,1965,the second one on May 7,1965.The result is one of Trane's most amazing live performances.Far better,for me,as the great \\"Seattle concert\\" or the \\"live in Japan\\" 4 CD set.As great as the colossal \\"Village Vanguard\\" 1961 live sessions,now available on five CDs. <br />You'll only listen to four tunes on these two CDs.Only four.The reason is that Trane blow extented versions of these themes: the shorter is \\"Afro blue\\"(\\"only\\" 12 minutes long);\\"Song of praise\\" is 20 minutes long,\\"my favorite thing\\"(a tune Coltrane played regularely for more than six years) is 23 minutes long;and \\"One down,one up\\" is nearly 28 minutes long. <br />\\"One down,one up\\" surely is the masterpiece of these two nights.And it may simply be one of Trane's greatest improvised efforts we can listen to.To all who may be afraid by Trane's music during the two last years of his short life (1926-1967),I have to say that this very long interpretation of \\"one down,one up\\",as the three other tunes played here,is much easier to listen to than his \\"Seattle\\", \\"Japan\\"or \\"Village Vanguard again\\" concerts.Of course,if you've never heard a John Coltrane record,it may not be the best way to discover his music.You could be afraid of what your ears will transmit to your brain.But if you're grown accustomed to his music,this will sound as an achievement and a kind of perfection in the work of a man who created new things every day in his life.He never could play twice the same things. <br />\\"Afro blue\\",a tune written by Mongo Santamaria which received lyrics by the underrated and great Oscar Brown Jr (1926-2005),is magnificently played here.I always thought that the 1963 version,recorded live at Birdland,was the greatest;now this new version can match with the other one.And it's far better to me than the other versions recorded at Seattle and in Japan.Coltrane's solo is more relaxed,yet more creative.McCoy Tyner's solo is a masterful one.There is another great version of \\"Afro blue\\" in the magical \\"Live Trane\\" 7 CD set. <br />The May 7 broadcast (both dates were recorded for radio) starts with \\"Song of praise\\".The Coltrane Quartet would record this piece again ten days later at Rudy Van Gelder's studio.This version is ten minutes longer.Another model of perfection.During his very long solo effort,Coltrane never plays twice the same thing.New ideas come as water in the river. <br />And finally...finally,there is one of the most extraordinary versions Coltrane did on the old \\"my favorite things\\".23 minutes of very great music.A masterpiece you'll discover by yourself.23 minutes of fascinating,haunting music. <br />Of course,I wouldn't advise the new listener to start his discovery of Coltrane's music with this two CD set.You need to be accustomed with his music to appreciate.But if you already own his Atlantic works,and some of his earlier Impulse efforts (\\"live at Birdland\\",\\"with Duke Ellington\\",\\"Coltrane\\",\\"Village Vanguard\\" or \\"Africa brass\\",then you're ready for this trip into Trane's cosmic music.And if you dig it,then you're OK for \\"Seattle\\",\\"Ascension\\",\\"Village Vanguard again\\",or the \\"Olatunji concert\\". <br />This issue of these legendary Half Note concerts may be the greatest thing that happened this year in the history of jazz.Another one is the terrific 1957 Carnegie Hall concert of the Thelonious Monk Quartet,with... John Coltrane;another gem recently issued on Blue Note.I hope that in the next years,we'll have the chance to listen to new material by this immense musician,who created between 1960 and 1967 some of the most important music of all times. <br />Thank a million to Alice Coltrane,Michelle Coltrane and Ravi Coltrane for giving the world the privilege to listen to these treasures.
B00004UEIH|5.0|One of the most historically important studio sessions of 1950s Thelonious Monk, and one that will no doubt be receiving excessive attention due to the recent issue of a live recording, \\"Thelonious Monk With John Coltrane\\" contains the only studio recordings the famed '57 Monk Quartet with John Coltrane made (Monk on piano, Trane on tenor sax, Wilbur Ware on bass and Shadow Wilson on drums).  The recording consisted only of three pieces-- \\"Ruby, My Dear\\", \\"Trinkle, Tinkle\\" and \\"Nutty\\"-- all Monk originals and stretching about 18 minutes long, so the issue is augmented by a pair of alternates from the \\"Monk's Music\\" sessions and a solo piano piece from the \\"Thelonious Himself\\" sessions. <br /> <br />But to start, the material that everyone gets this for-- the quartet pieces.  Really, there's just not enough good things to say about the two of them.  Trane digs deep on \\"Ruby, My Dear\\", no doubt at least partially with Coleman Hawkins' quartet rendition in his head (it was recorded a month earlier as part of the \\"Monk's Music\\" session), he blows with a sensitivity and softness of tone that is rather rare in Coltrane's playing, and he out-Hawks Hawk.  \\"Trinkle, Tinkle\\" is fractured theme where Coltrane strolls over Ware and Wilson, soloing fiercely while Monk listens on without playing (both Monk and Ware also take fantastic solos, but Trane's is the highlight).  \\"Nutty\\" is an exciting midtempo piece with Monk positively exploratory in and around Coltrane's theme statement.  It's curious that he chooses to lay out and let Coltrane stroll, but the young tenor's performance is jarringly brilliant, there's little question in the wisdom of doing it. <br /> <br />The pieces from the \\"Monk's Music\\" session fare remarkably well, even if they are dramatically opposed to the sound of the rest of the record-- Monk, Coltrane and Ware all perform, along with three other horns (trumpeter Ray Copeland, altoist Gigi Gryce and tenor legend Coleman Hawkins) and drummer Art Blakey.  Theresult is a much bigger sound-- \\"Off Minor\\" features an almost little-big-band sound to it, with Copeland in opposition to the reeds and is comparable to the issued take, but it's \\"Epistrophy\\" that is the most intriguing-- it received a nearly eleven minute workout on \\"Monk' Muisc\\", here it stretches just over three minutes-- more importantly is that it captures an odd level of excitement and energy-- opening with a cadence from Blakey before settling into a horn statement and blowing wide open into a deep swinging theme statements with brief solos by Trane and Copeland. <br /> <br />The closing track is a piano solo titled \\"Functional\\"-- a different piece from the 'other' track titled \\"Functional\\" (on \\"Thelonious Himself\\").  This particular piece is a bluesy and moody extended piano solo betraying (as many of Monk's solos do) his love of stride music.  It's a nice piece and a great way to cool off after the hot take of \\"Epistrophy\\". <br /> <br />Like all the 20-bit remastered recordings, the sound on this particular issue is unnervingly superb, augmenting the listening experience without analog hiss, etc. getting in the way.  Make sure you get the remastered release-- its night and day difference! <br /> <br />There are better Monk recordings out there, but there's not a whole bunch of them.  Highly recommended.

6305511055|4.0|The strength of 3 Days of the Condor is in the role of CIA agent Condor, Joe Turner played by Robert Redford, a book reader for the CIA who finds the organisation he works for suddenly whipped out by a ruthless bunch of assassins led by the German Joubert, Max Von Sydow, in a famous sequence that is almost prophetic of the office rampages we hear about today in the news. Quickly phoning HQ, Condor is ordered to rendezvous with a pickup only to be speedily thrown into a game of cat and mouse with shadow agencies and his own competing against one another. Although there are some surprises in store, plot twists and the memorable tense elevator scene (did you drop these gloves sir?), 3 Days of the Condor is sadly let down by a lack of depth in the plot and some unconventional breaks in the pace, such as the overlong kidnapping background love story with Kathy, Faye Dunaway, and the Scooby-doo explanation ending that never really seems to answer much, leaving the viewer with a sort of half-satisfied explanation for the high body count shadow operations being witnessed. Although playing itself somewhat well to the tune of cold war atmosphere, this `man on the run' leaves many loose ends open and much to the imagination. This is mostly due to the very interesting confrontation between Turner and Joubert that is downplayed by the final scene where Condor confronts his boss.<br /><br />With a high television replay count 3 Days of the Condor has shown itself to be a very popular movie and Redford does his bit well, bringing out the bookworm's military manoeuvres now and again, this is a 70s conspiracy thriller highlight, although there are now better and deeper movies that revolve around the same theme. The Bourne Identity/Supremacy is really where the game is at now. 3 Days of the Condor, although being on the run for a good run, takes a backseat to the new pace.

B000002L9M|4.0|like so many of my fellow mode-a-philes, 'black celebration' long held a place as my favorite DM album.  it seemed to be the last dm album martin truly indulged his black fantasies (in later releases he would give religion/god equal time).  the entire album (as referenced in the title) reveled in its own gloominess.  the album's titular track left little doubt as to the album's direction: 'let's have a black celebration...tonight': a rather ominous foreshadowing of the album's tone.<br /><br />as with most dm albums, martin delves into similar lyrical territoy.  'black celebration seems to focus on two primary themes--death and sexuality (it also includes martin's first overt political statement 'new dress'). 'black celebration,' 'fly on the windscreen' touch on death and darkness, while the remainder of the album visits and revisits sexuality ('question of lust,' 'here is the house,' 'stripped,' 'it doesn't matter two,' 'a question of time,' 'sometimes,' and 'world full of nothing.').  Each song deals with, in some way, sexuality--particulary it's emotional impact. i think this makes 'black celebration' something of an overly-obssesive album, but it still works as an album. one can't help but wonder about martin's emotional state while he wrote the album.<br /><br />sex, innuedo and double-entendres aside, it's gone some of dm's better songs including my all-timer 'stripped' (find the highland mix if you can--it smokes the original). the synth-line intro in 'stripped' almost makes the album worth buying in and of itself.  'a question of lust' is 'somebody's' dirty little sister in stiletto heels and fishnets. 'a question of time' is a dance floor stomper with a slightly unsettling (though affecting) synth-line.<br /><br />the album's closer, 'but not tonight,' while one of my favorite dm songs ever, is so out of place on this album. it seems as though it was thrown on as an after thought, and since it didn't appear on the u.k. release, i assume it was (it might have been better to include the b-sides 'breathing in fumes,' and 'black day' instead of 'but not tonight.' that would've made the album complete, in my opinion).<br /><br />thematically speaking, i wonder if martin in some way views death and darkness synonymous with sexuality.  it could be me reading too much into the material, but i think it's a valid argument. i doubt there was anyone else out there writing material like this in the mid-late 80s. does that make martin a bit of a radical or renegade? sure. i think that's what makes 'black celebration' an important album, not just and important dm album. think about 'love' songs of the mid-late 80s--richard marx, debbie gibson, tiffany. all fluff. martin was a nice foil for superficial, empty, teenaged 'love.'<br /><br />in all, dm fans celebrate 'black celebration' for precisely these reasons. martin delves into subjects and themes a lot of are just too squimish to address. in this way, 'black celebration' is very much a vicarious listening experience and will alway hold a top spot in the dm canon.de the b-sides 'breathing in fumes,' and 'black day' instead of 'but not tonight.' that would've made the album complete, in my opinion).    thematically speaking, i wonder if martin in some way views death and darkness synonymous with sexuality.  it could be me reading too much into the material, but i think it's a valid argument. i doubt there was anyone else out there writing material like this in the mid-late 80s. does that make martin a bit of a radical or renegade? sure. i think that's what makes 'black celebration' an important album, not just and important dm album. think about 'love' songs of the mid-late 80s--richard marx, debbie gibson, tiffany. all fluff. martin was a nice foil for superficial, empty, teenaged 'love.'    in all, dm fans celebrate 'black celebration' for precisely these reasons. martin delves into subjects and themes a lot of are just too squimish to address. in this way, 'black celebration' is very much a vicarious listening experience and will alway hold a top spot in the dm canon.
B0006B2A42|5.0|This movie has a strong star name cast - Patrick McGoohan, Ernest Borgnine, Rock Hudson and Jim Brown.  McGoohan is brilliant as ever.  A perfectionist of an actor, he once again is play a Brit super-spy (Secret Agent, Prisoner).  It's a role he is comfortable with and he brings his subtle, yet incisive touches to conjur this character alive.  Borgnine, never gives less than 110% to a role is perfect at the anti-Russian Russian.  Brown to fierce as the man no one really likes and suspects he might be more than he pretends.  Hudson is the weakest link.  His lines were written to come out of an actor with the same power and presence as McGoohan and Borgnine - Robert Mitchum.  Had Mitchum played the role this movie would have been dead on target.  Against McGoohan and Borgnine, Hudson shows he had all the range from A-B.  In the very dramatic scene where McGoohan is telling how to wreck a sub, he is dead on perfect - every word every gesture.  Hudson gives his rebuttal and comes across as trying to echo McGoohan's strength.  Mitchum could have looked McGoohan in the eye and it would have been a long staring contest before either blinked!<br /><br />It's a race to the North Pole to reach a weather station that has gone out of contact after a camera that contained spy film lands there.  You have the Russians rushes to reach there, and the US group with their multinational spies trying to make it there first.<br /><br />Great adventure from start to finish a good adaptation of Alistair MacLean's best-selling book.

Why did western European civilization come to dominate the world in the last few centuries instead of the Chinese or the Native Americans? The fundamental answer to this question is the title of this scientific masterpiece: Western Europeans had the \\"Guns\\" that won them the beachhead in the Americas, and the \\"Germs\\" that gave them the ultimate victory in the Americas, and thus the necessary sociopolitical base away from other Europeans, from which to develop the \\"Steel\\" that gave and keeps them in dominion (after 513 years). Brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002V0Q|5.0|I bought this CD about 2 years ago, and quite frankly, it's one of Megadeth's best albums and probably my favourite (\\"Peace Sells...\\" is also incredible). \\"Countdown To Extinction,\\" was a bit of a deviation from Megadeth's all out riffage, as can be seen on their previous and highly impressive album, \\"Rust In Peace.\\" Whoever said this is more mainstream is snorting coke...just because the production is cleaner doesn't mean it's more mainstream! And Megadeth have been making videos since 1985! Those giving this CD less than 4 stars either need a damn good reason for giving it less or they need their heads checked...so on to the album...<br /><br />Opener \\"Skin O' My Teeth,\\" begins with a killer drum roll and superb riff. Dave Ellefson's Bass work on this song is great (as it is for the whole album). The song is full of energy and angst. The song seems to be talking about how all humans feel pain in life and how our existences are so fragile and temporary. Friedman dishes out a scorchin solo and the climaxes and anti-climaxes are cleverly interspersed. It's a brilliant piece and a phenomenal opener. 9.5/10 for \\"Skin O' My Teeth.\\"<br /><br />\\"Symphony Of Destruction,\\" was the song that got me hooked on Megadeth. It starts with an opera warm-up and then bursts into a heavy, angry guitar riff. The lyrics growl and moan, and have a very political edge. The whole song links to the theme of the album. We as humans are headed down a road of destruction with poor leaders, violence, protests and conformist thinking. The chorus is sonic and the solo is so incredibly awesome! Just close your eyes and think of everything bad in the world, I nearly weep from the emotion in that one solo! \\"Symphony Of Destruction,\\" is heavy, apocalyptic, angry, sorrowful and simply superior. 11/10 for the 2nd track.<br /><br />\\"Architecture Of Aggression,\\" is yet another out-of-this world song. It starts off with sounds of machinegun fire and a keyboard synth. Then the riff kicks in, followed by the drums and finally the bass. This song reeks of brilliance and energy. The bass work on this song is the best on the whole album, and it sounds like Ellefson is using a pick at certain points on this song, giving a kind of clang to the bass which heightens the emotion of the song. Once again the use of climaxes and anti-climaxes are well placed. The solo is scathing and yet another feather in Friedman's cap. The song talks about war and its effects, and how it's nothing but destructive. Another 11/10 for \\"Architecture Of Aggression.\\"<br /><br />\\"Foreclosure Of A Dream,\\" begins with an electric guitar being picked. The start of the song is quite slow and emotive, whereas the chorus is heavier and full of angst. This song is underrated in my opinion and is one of Megadeth's better slow songs. The lead work is nothing short of pure skill. The song talks about the realisation that some things that you want really are unachievable and that some dreams will never become reality. The solo is epic and sharp. I really enjoy this song, and it deserves 9.5/10 I think.<br /><br />\\"Sweating Bullets,\\" is one of Megadeth's more technical songs, but really kicks a$$. The video for this song is disturbing, but also has a dark humour...I can't help but laugh at all the Dave Mustaine's, I dunno why. This song seems to talk about what it feels like to be stricken with fear and also says volumes about humanity's foolishness and insanity. The guitar work sounds superb, the solo is slower than most of the solo's on this album, but is highly effective and a brilliant listen. The main riff chugs and carries the song along, the drums sound clear and punchy. The refrain is also pretty strange, with the vocals fading in and out, a sense of being seperate from yourself. It's yet another one of Megadeth's greatest songs and fully deserves 11/10. I'll fight to the death (or deth) against anyone who opposes that, I swear!<br /><br />\\"This Was My Life,\\" is a really great song, but not my favourite. The song begins with guitars growling and then kicking in to a full, all-out riff. The lyrics are intelligent and poignant, and seem to be talking about the \\"struggle\\" for people from day to day, and also reminds one of the temporary state of our existence. There's also a heavy focus on the negative side of humankind. The solo is fairly simple but still effective. It's technically very well structured and deserves 9/10 I think.<br /><br />\\"Countdown To Extinction,\\" begins with some heavy guitars which then die down to allow the bass to have a \\"solo\\" bit. The song talks about how we as humans kill animals for sport, using only the most advanced equipment and we are no longer worthy of our prey. The main chorus riff has a strange Irish feel to it (I know it's weird, I just sense something there that sounds Irish). The bassline is terrific and the main riff is energetic and full of rage and sadness. The song is really moving and makes you think about man's terrible destructiveness. It's a song I won't soon forget, especially for its originality. 10/10 for Track 7.<br /><br />\\"High Speed Dirt,\\" is a good song, but is probably the weakest song on the album. The main riff is fast and the crescendos are effective, but there's nothing that you really remember about this song. I can sometimes remember the lyrics, but I'm not 100% sure of what this song's about. It's good but definitely not the best. Track 8 gets 7.5/10 in my book.<br /><br />\\"Psychotron,\\" is a better song, but also not my favourite. The main riff is steady and hard-hitting, and the bass sounds great. This song seems to be talking about the future and how one day we as humans may not be distinguishable between robots. However, Psychotron may be one of Megadeth's weird characters, like good old Vic. It's an enjoyable song and one I usually listen to. \\"Psychotron\\" gets 8.5/10 as far as this album goes.<br /><br />\\"Captive Honour,\\" is a song that I used to absolutely adore. I still love the beginning (it starts off with Dave singing and then a \\"Trial\\" being conducted where the main character, whoever that may be, is found to be guilty.) Then the song kicks into high gear with some inspiring lead and vocal work. The song talks about the problems with the judicial system and how innocent men are put in jail while the guilty walk our streets. The song moves along like a steam-engine and the verses are powerful and angry. This could've been another single I believe, it's a really great song. The solo also rips, the finger-tapping at the end is just...WOAH! 10/10 for \\"Captive Honour.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ashes In Your Mouth,\\" is an unbelievable song that only suffers from its somewhat awkward arrangement and structure. The song begins with all instruments and has a take-no-prisoners (excuse the pun) approach. The song talks about the pointlessness of violence and how humanity can be unbelievably cruel and callous. The verse sounds cool and the chorus is emotive. The refrain is incredible and chugs away like a bonesaw. The song also seems to talk about the improbability and unpredictability of the future (i.e. \\"Where do We go from here?\\" and \\"the end is finally here.\\") The solo is epic, and the second park is undeniably wonderful. \\"Ashes In Your Mouth,\\" does have a slightly disjointed structure though, so it gets 9/10 I think.<br /><br />And there you have it. All 11 songs rated. You have 3 Godly songs, 2 Outstanding songs, 2 Excellent songs, 2 Very Good songs, 1 Good song and 1 Pretty Good Song. So overall \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" gets an A+, and about 96% (106 out of 110). I hope that serves you well. It's a great buy and an epic album. Buy it now or else...else...well, something bad may happen to you! Whatever you think, I know that this album is just crazily amazing!my favourite.

B00004T9UF|5.0|Well what can i say Lookin Back At It this was da greatest Em album too date and one of da best albums in da hip hop culture , all da tracks on these albums were dope and had meanings to them , and what made this album so great is how em can go from a dark gorey song too a hillarious song , that what seperates em from da other greats , Da writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of his ruptured Sychopathic Attitude , Which Makes It All Da More Better. The production is nearly as evocative as the raps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. Da production was just so ill and then his clever rhymes of comedy and da dark life was just legendary, This is gotta be one of the best Hip Hop Albums Too Date.
B000AYEIZY|4.0|This Concert is for people like me who remember Cream.  The 60's are gone. This album is three musicians who were at the top of the world at one time. You have to remember 37 years have elapsed. The group broke up on less than good terms. The feuding between Baker and Bruce was effecting Clapton. So Clapton told the band he wanted to move on. 37 Years later they seem to be the best of friends and enjoying the music as well as the friendship. I guess the band knew they were lucky to still be able to perform together after such a long time.  Thank God, they did  Eric Clapton was then and still is the show. Clapton actually plays better now than he did then.  Jack Bruce is still an outstanding bass player, and Ginger Baker can still drum with the best of them.  Vocally the album has something to be desired. Neither Clapton nor Bruce can hit the high notes anymore. They both on several songs have to sing an octive lower.  What this does do is give those of us who never saw Cream live a chance to see them perform their music on DVD and CD.  Unfortunately the concerts provided in the 60's are not well filmed and leave much to be desired.  This is exactly what you would think it would be. Three great musicians who are past their prime who still can play with the best of them............The word \\"Cream\\" still applies
B00000294R|5.0|Having made a name for himself as a guest MC on D.I.T.C. (Diggin' in the Crates) projects such as Diamond D.'s Stunts, Blunts & Hip-Hop and Showbiz & A.G.'s Runaway Slave, the flamboyantly gifted Lamont Coleman (aka Big L) dropped his debut in early 1995. A product of the mean streets of Harlem, L made his bones in the rap game with his rapid fire freestyle delivery and clever punchline-peppered rhymes. A patchwork album with a few outstanding cuts, Lifestylez fails to package the lightning-in-a-bottle talent of this cut-above MC. The album showcases L as a master of the lyrical stickup undressing his competition with kinetic metaphors and a brash comedic repertoire. The lead track, \\"Put It On\\" produced by Kid Capri, is a party cut with a criminal attitude. \\"M.V.P.\\" snatches a brief segment from DeBarge's \\"Stay With Me\\" (later aggrandized on the Notorious B.I.G.'s popular remix of \\"One More Chance\\"). \\"Da Graveyard\\" features a young Cam'ron (here Killa Kam) and most notably a superb verse from a pre-Jigga Jay-Z (at the outset of his solo career). With better production and marketing, Big L might have found himself with a platinum album but instead he settled for platinum respect. This album captures the dynamic potential of a street legend, a legend who would later be gunned down in his prime. This is definately the most under rated rap album i know , and Big l arguably the best lyricall rapper too ever grace the mic. but too bad the world would never really know , this would be his only album he recorded. (The Big Picture LP was never fully recorded bye L it was just a bunch of underground stuff he recorded mashed together , was pretty good but still wasent really his real shidd) R.I.P. BIG L
0525457585|5.0|I don't know if anybody else has noticed this, but Micheal Ende must have been spiritually enlightened, to have written this book. <br /> <br />For starters, the fact that Bastain reads a story and becomes part of it, is Ende's way of telling the reader that everything is just a story, even Bastians \\"Reality\\". <br /> <br />Fantastica is a creation of the human mind. For a human to exist they're mind needs to be full of stories. That's why fantastica dies when no human makes up stories for it. <br /> <br />At the Southern Oracle, Ende perfectly descirbes what it is to become spiritually enlightened. <br /> <br />Atreyu must pass through three magic gates. <br /> <br />The first one Is guarded by two sphinxes. If the sphinxes open their eyes as atreyu is walking through he will be rooted to the spot until he has answered all the riddles in the universe. <br /> <br />The second gate is a magic mirror gate, in which you see a reflection of yourself. It states in the book that some people run screaming from what they see in that mirror. That's because alot of people aren't aware of their true self, and if someone were to show them what they really are, they would be terrified. Sometimes people go to seek emotional help, and they find out who they really have become, and it's not easy. That's what Ende was showing us with the Magic Mirror gate. It shows the truth. <br /> <br />The third gate, doesn't open unless you forget why you wanted to go through it. This is one of the most amazing ideas ever. <br /> <br />If you want to become enlightened you can't, because to become enlightened, you must let go of your story (your mind). So for the mind to \\"want\\" to get enlightened, it gets in the way. Your story needs to be gone, before you can become enlightened. You can't \\"Want\\" to become enlightened. So that's what the third gate is. <br /> <br />Then we come to the Old man of Wandering mountain, where we learn that the Neverending story is a story that has already been written, and is unchangable before and after, and in starting to read the story from the beginning creates a vicious cycle that will never end unless Bastian breaks it. We learn there that our whole life is just a story in our imagination. <br /> <br />Later in the book, Bastain learns that Fantastica lies on a bed of memories. This is because we would not exist without memories. <br /> <br />Think about it. Your whole lives story is a memory. Fantasica is a story of the human mind, and the human mind is based on memories. Then he must forget who he his, to go back to his world. In other words become enlightened. Let go of the \\"self\\", the \\"I\\" that is just an illusion. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant book. I've read it 2 or 3 times, and am in the middle of reading it again. It is SO amazing. <br /> <br />The old man of wandering mountain (chapter 12) is one of the most brilliant sections of writing I have ever read. It nails the nature of the universe more clearly than any science book, astrology, or anything that's meant to teach what Michal Ende put so brilliantly into this book. <br /> <br />If you've already read it, read it again with this in mind. It's like a different story.
B000063DHL|5.0|I still remember the first time I heard this album almost 18 years ago.  It blew my mind, at the time I didn't pay too much attention to the lyrics but as time went by and my english got better, i started paying attention.

Up to this day, anytime I feel down and life seems to get hard, I listen to the loneliness of the long distance runner.... <br /> <br />I've got to keep running the course <br />I've got to keep running and win at <br />All costs <br />I've got to keep going be strong <br />Must be so determined and push myself on <br /> <br />Never fails to give me a lift.  Too bad I never saw them perform this live.  This is a must have. <br />
0743455967|5.0|My agent said I needed to read King's book.  She told me to skip the exercises - to spend the day, read the book through, and get back to work.      The first part of the book, King's life story, was interesting, offering encouragement to this author who has lived life mostly in the ditches, rarely on the main road.    The other part is filled with great little tidbits for the experienced-but-unpublished author.  Especially helpful were his lecture on telling the truth about life and your characters - Don't give a damn about what the world thinks, be true to your story and characters.     King's essay on work surroundings, atmosphere, and habits proved especially helpful.  While I haven't yet reached my two-thousand-words-a-day goal, I'm closing in on it.    Thanks to Stephen King for taking the time to share his experience with this soon-to-be-published author!    Bob Walker  [...]
B000AL730O|5.0|This Macca album extracts from Paul and we the listeners a number of unexpected demands  <br /> <br />1. Patience - the album doesn't reveal itself fully until a number of listens.   <br /> <br />2. Professionalism...besides for the occasional Martin. In contrast, much of Driving Rain sounds incomplete and insufficient.  <br /> <br />3. Subtlety - The Devil is in the little details The choices made are the right ones.  Melodies, trings, bass lines, vocal harmonies, guitars, percussion weave in and out. <br /> <br />4. Cleverness - weaving of melody and harmony in and out. It doesn't sound like Steely Dan, but there's the same CARE and THOUGHT <br /> <br />5. Challenging - Godrich pulls from Paul his best - wrung the laziness right out of him. <br /> <br />6. The whole is more than the sum of parts...Sometime, someway, some day, you'll get the flow from How Kind of You to Anyway and will be hooked. <br /> <br />Instead of the choke-hold of instant melody imprinting of the Beatles, we have a more persuasive introspective writing and production. This is an album for adults, not arrested-development adolescents. In the end Paul makes it sound so damn effortless. Almost as if these songs and recordings had ALWAYS existed. The mark of true genius. <br /> <br />Certainly one of the best of the post Beatle recordings for a Fab Four, if not the best. <br /> <br />How Kind of You, Jenny Wren, At the Mercy, Friends to Go, English Tea, Too Much Rain, Riding to Vanty Fair, Promise to You Girl, This Never Happened Before, Anyway are classic recordings. Follow Me. and A Certain Softness are close. <br /> <br />Friends to Go, This Never Happened Before, and Vanity Fair in particular are darn near perfect.  Friends to Go would be my choice for a single.  George and Paul would be proud. This album is almost an apology for most of his career and \\"Freedom.\\" <br /> <br />Now someone else can worry about Paul.  There's no longer any need for him to.
B000BBYMA2|2.0|Battle Royale (Kinji Fukasaku, 2000)<br /><br />I committed what may be the cardinal sin where watching movies based on books is concerned-- I saw the film less than a year after I read the book. I have always hypothesized that this was the reason for my, shall we say, overly hostile reaction to Malick's desecration of James Jones' brilliant novel The Thin Red Line; at least I can say with some authority that I didn't hate Battle Royale anywhere near as badly as I hated The Thin Red Line.<br /><br />Most of my problem with the film adaptation comes from changes that were made to the events in the book that didn't need making in any way, shape, or form (for example, the timing of Yukiko and Yumiko's deaths, which comes later in the novel, or, most notably, Kawada's assertion that Kiriyama \\"signed up\\" for the game, which changes the whole atmosphere). There are some things that, we're all aware by now, simply don't translate well to the screen (e.g., the portions of the novel where Takami goes into Kiriyama's mental state), and those were forgiven before the movie started rolling. Still, there were some changes made that those who have already read the novel will find unforgivable, if not unconscionable.<br /><br />The plot of the movie, as thin as it is, has excited a good deal of controversy: in an alternate-world Japan, the government has instituted a yearly Battle Royale, where a high school class picked at random is sent to an out-of-the-way island and forced to kill one another until there is a single survivor. The controversy seems to be over the ages of the subjects, given that as far as the actual action is concerned, this is pretty standard thriller fare (there's nothing in the film even remotely as disturbing as the \\"curbing\\" scene from American History X, for example). One of the most amusing things about the movie is that those unnecessary changes made to the novel while it was adapted are the only places in the film where truly gaping holes arise in the premise (it's impossible to go into detail without major spoilers, so I'll just say that some of the characters' ages couldn't possibly mesh with this being one high school class [IMDB specifies they're a ninth-grade class]; this is confirmed during a critical piece of dialogue about two-thirds of the way through the film).<br /><br />If you're looking for a solid action flick with a high body count, you don't care about plot holes, and you haven't read the book, you'll probably greatly enjoy Battle Royale; I know many people who have. If you've read the book, however, I urge you to avoid the movie. **in the premise (it's impossible to go into detail without major spoilers, so I'll just say that some of the characters' ages couldn't possibly mesh with this being one high school class [IMDB specifies they're a ninth-grade class]; this is confirmed during a critical piece of dialogue about two-thirds of the way through the film). <br /> <br />If you're looking for a solid action flick with a high body count, you don't care about plot holes, and you haven't read the book, you'll probably greatly enjoy Battle Royale; I know many people who have.

0525948023|5.0|This is another humble and clearly written contribution to the literature of self understanding.  It has been long anticipated and its timely arrival brings with it a sense of optimism and peace. In his typically non-judgemental fashion, Tolle delineates the current state of human development, explaining his insights into the limitations and dysfunctionality of thought.  Woven into the fabric of this symptomatic and descriptive analysis of the human condition are his insights into what steps can be taken to lessen the limitations and neutralize the dysfunction.  The state of our world today and the insanity that is abundantly present in all directions begs for an accurate diagnosis and workable cure. This work is a step forward in the direction of accomplishing that goal.

Who cant forget those humorous moments on our friends's lifes: Chandler in a box, Monica dancing on top of a vacuum cleaner, Ross get stuck on his leather pants, Joey not having a commited relationship, Phoebe marrying Mike even though she was freezing, or thinking her aunt was stuck in a cat. Yep I will treasure those moments forever. The cast of Friends lives on my heart forever. They help us all thru tough moments.

B00006V9A0|4.0|I'm generally a generation behind everyone when it comes to music.  I had never heard a Nirvana song until someone played \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" for me no more than two years ago.  From the second I heard that song, I knew that Nirvana was all it had been cracked up to be.  My friend loaned me this album, Nirvana, and I couldn't get it out of my stereo.  From the first dark guitars of \\"You Know You're Right\\" straight through to the fading applause at the end of \\"The Man Who Sold The World,\\" I couldn't keep myself from thinking just how good Nirvana is (was)--whatever.<br /><br />  Many have complained that this is a scant greatest hits offering from such a terrific band.  But I don't think this album is intended for die hard fans.  This album is intended for those such as I, who never bothered listening to Nirvana before, and have heard maybe one or two songs and want to hear more.  This album is intended to whet the appetite, and make you want to go and pick up one of Nirvana's albums.  So, I would recommend this to anyone who has never really listened to Nirvana much, but wants to give them a try.  If you're a fan who already has their 4 albums, I wouldn't bother.<br /><br />Overall, this is an album that's only flaw is that it is not longer, but what is here is pure rock gold.
0321213351|3.0|The book is good in terms of how it is organised and the topics that it covers.   <br /> <br />However, the choice of the type of  examples used are poor. I recommend that the entire  listing of the code before refactoring and  after refactoring should be provided along with each chapter. Often I got lost while walking through the code snippets, as the steps that the author is walking through does not necessarily match the way I would walk through the code while refactoring using patterns. Sometimes it is hard to predict why the author did what he did, although it is just an intermediate step to to reach the ultimate goal. Some of the code snippets does not match the class diagrams and caused added confusion.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is simply an incredible film that captures the minds of the people who watch it; this feature-length movie contains REAL squirrels, trained squirrels that is, a REAL river and waterfall, gynormous imaginative big views of the humungous factory, magical things and ideas and machines that capture your interest, and many, many more. <br /> <br />Make sure you have a chocolate bar with you when you watch this, you'll need it. This is a chocolate sensation, filled with tons of tasty treats that will send your mind spinning and your hungry growing. This movie seems to be the most hungry-making movie in history, and unlike the previous 'Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory,' this movie contains many, many more scenes relating to the smashing book by Roald Dahl that started it all. <br /> <br />With crazy names like 'Wonka Whipple Scrumptious Fudge-Mallow Delight,' and 'Fruity Wobble Drop Supreme,' these movie will STARVE you. <br /> <br />The amazing views and colorful factory make this movie so incredible, you can hardly imagine any other movie like it. You've NEVER seen a movie like this, and the characters are so acting-filled and so colorful, this movie is lacking NOTHING, all except the rather disappointing fact that the Oompa Loompa songs are slightly shortened, but that can all be solved if you buy the soundtrack, which is REALLY worth the money in my opinion. <br /> <br />Willy Wonka's new dressing design really captures your eyes, with dark-colored themed clothes and glowing hints of red all over his jacket and shoes, it makes Jonny Depp a whole new person. <br /> <br />The wacky 'W' shown everywhere in the movie is posively perfect, and you can buy these Nestle Wonka Bars in the UK, unfortunately for US residents. <br /> <br />You'll want to watch this movie over and over again, and the song lyrics ripped from Dahl's book are wonderful and with tons of Techno/Rock/Dance Musical Themes, making them much more exciting to watch. <br /> <br />Many say that Jonny Depp cannot beat Gene Wilder, you watch this and see what you think. <br /> <br />The movie is darker and adults will also like this, along with children and of course the sweet happy ending as usual won't leave any terrorizing thoughts in your mind, especially with the 'Wonka's Welcome Song' credits to follow. <br /> <br />The INCREDIBLE music by Danny Elfman, with harp and rock and computer-made musical sounds, along with the great camera filming that's not a bit bumpy can really catch your mind as you watch this. Tons of amazing special effects and wild ideas are incredible as they are placed into this movie, and I give this sweet adventure, with all of my movie-rating heart, a 5/5. <br /> <br />Simply Incredible.
B000AA305M|1.0|I have loved David Gray's music for 4 years. He is a hardworking artist and deserves to be paid for his work, as all artists do, but the copy protection on Life in Slow Motion goes beyond the pale. I cannot even hear the music or watch the DVD.  <br /> <br />I purchased the dualdisc version of this cd and neither iTunes nor the DVD player on my new Mac can read either side. It's not a problem with the computer; every other cd and dualdisc I've ever loaded has worked. Not this one--the computer just kicks the disc right back out. The copy protection has made the disc useless. I still don't even know what the album sounds like.  <br /> <br />Why would David Gray agree to this--did he even have a choice? The miscreants at Sony BMG should be ashamed of themselves. They must be aware of iTunes and the iPod: millions of people use them every day, and use iTunes as their home stereo. And Sony's decision is to make this cd totally useless to all those people? And by the way there is absolutely NOTHING on the packaging of the dualdisc that says it will be incompatible with a Mac. It just says \\"not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc.\\" What does that even mean? Why would a new computer not be able to play it? And how does anyone know whether it will work on their system or not?  <br /> <br />I will never buy another \\"copy protected\\" cd, at least by Sony, and I'm returning this useless dog. They've not only stopped copying, which may be legit, but they apparently believe even after you've purchased it, that they can determine how and  if you're able to listen to the music. I'd love to rate the music if I could hear it.  <br /> <br />What a disgrace.

B000AL730O|5.0|Yesterday I had a four-hour drive ahead of me and I purposed to finally buy and listen to \\"Chaos\\" on the way home.  Like so many I expect, it's hard for me to separate myself from my history with McCartney and the Beatles.  But I'm a lifelong musician/songwriter and I'd also like to think I know Shinola from that other substance!  From the very first notes of this disc to the very last, I was captivated.  Although the song titles may be somewhat interchangeable, almost every McCartney listener has their own dual lists of his albums and/or tracks: \\"The Stuff He Probably Phoned In\\" and \\"The Stuff Where He Really Tried Like He Meant It\\".  You know, \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" balanced against \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". <br /> <br />The sounds of \\"Chaos\\" are wonderful, the vocals are superb, the melodies are classic McCartney but not totally predictable either.  I guess Paul should officially join the \\"Guys Who Still Sing as Good as They Did Back Then Club\\", joining Jon Anderson of Yes, Richie Furay, Michael McDonald, Stephen Bishop and Brian Wilson.  Having been thrilled by Brian Wilson's \\"Smile\\" and now listening to \\"Chaos\\", I kept wondering \\"Geesh, what kind of bottled water do these guys drink?\\" and \\"How can I get some?\\". <br /> <br />I also tried to imagine an impossible thing: What if this exact set of songs/recordings had been released as McCartney's first post-Beatles solo album (instead of number thirty-plus)?  I think we would have been blown away then ... and I have to admit that I'm blown away now.  It's not perfect, but I do think this outing is, for lack of a better benchmark, absolutely \\"during-the-Beatles\\" good ... and it sounds to me like he really means it.  For that, I'm grateful. <br />
B000002JPA|5.0|A great album from Dream Thaeter, My favorite track is of course Under A Glass Moon, where Petrucci show's of his infamouse talent as a technical as well as melodic guitarist. Another Day is also a great track with an addictive Saxophone line. I would definitely recommend this album to any Dream Theater fan.
0393327655|1.0|All the world loves a villain; especially an all-powerful one upon whom every conceivable human misfortune can be blamed.  For Mr. Harris that villain is religious belief.  He is astounded that some people in this would have the audacity to believe in a power higher than themselves.  Moreover, he is convinced - like a conspiracy nut looking for a grand unification theory - that there would not be misery but for the irrational propensity to religion.  Never mind that there would not be a Sistine chapel or Handel's Messiah either- humanity has been held back by monkish superstition foisted upon it by charlatans. <br /> <br />There is really nothing new here, except perhaps for the level of vitriol aimed at modern believers.  When you impose a philosophy of objective characterizations on a matter that summons personal and subjective beliefs it is called chauvinism.  When you condemn a people for their religious beliefs it is called hatred.  This quibbling mountain of twaddle somehow relishes in both.  Bowing in homage to the humanist altar of `science', Mr. Harris writes with myopic intensity that makes the reader question his motives.  Is he disheartened by American political trends which polarize policymaking on the basis of moral approbation?  Is he threatened by those who challenge the ironclad orthodoxies of his `Star Trek' like world-view?  I suspect that his work has its appeal for an insular minority of nattering intelligentsia, but almost no marketable potential as a political movement.  In the United States an object called the Constitution (drafted by pernicious Christians) presents a formidable obstacle to his `final solution' of eradicating religious inclination.  Atheistic fascism of the early 20th century failed to give this sort of ranting any political traction in American life.  Why should this book be any more successful?   <br /> <br />Somewhere a college professor is thumbing through this book madly with ecstacy.  I suppose even the nonbelievers have their Bibles.
0762405457|5.0|I would recommend this book to all people with a good vocabulary and an affinity for science. It begins and ends with letter writing, but the meat of the book is of Frankenstein telling his tale. It is rife with extremely long sentences and difficult words, but also has wonderful insights of strong hatred, vengeance, love, and passion. It is at first a little hard to read, but once you get into it you can't put it down easily. So, to all you well educated children and adults, or even you who want to strengthen your vocabulary and read a superb tale of emotion and adventure at the same time, [...]. You won't be disappointed.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I love it, bought it today.  Most stand out cut is \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Love It Or Leave It Alone\\".  The live songs are great has \\"Karma\\" sounded any better live? <br /> <br />
B00007L4MJ|5.0|...but you have to suspend modern day disbelief to truly enjoy it. The storyline has been thoroughly presented in these reviews: the segregated society of the haves and have-nots living in a mechanized world. The saintly Maria who wishes for a mediator between the Hands (the subterranean workers) and the Heads (the surface revelers but most specifically Mr Frederson senior, the 'Creator' of Metropolis). There is a significant and rather clumsy religious overtone to the story which in retrospect (it is a 1927 movie) should not have been a surprise. What also should not have been a surprise was the lusty frolicksome behavior on display (pre-code!!) considering that the movie was, again, filmed during the Weimar Republic. Think \\"Cabaret\\". Anyway, the visual are truly spectacular once your disbelief is fully suspended. The \\"mad scientist\\" scenes rival modern day attempts and are simply amazing. Another scene of note to movie afficinados is the one where Frederson fils discovers what he believes is his paramour Maria in his father's arms...the rage and confusion is palpable and excellently expressed by blinding flashes of light. I think I have experienced just what Oedipus felt! Recommended.
0321213351|3.0|It would have been much better if it contained the FULL source code or at the very least the availability to download such. The book however has benefited our group of about 12  in identifying \\"smelly\\" code. After which and using Joshua's examples we were able to apply some low level refactorings and some of the more comprehensive refactorings  which has made our code more clear. Good Book. Hopefully the source code becomes available...then I will revise my stars to 5.

B000002U82|5.0|See, THIS is what music is supposed to be about. Pink Floyd shows in this album that rock music can be a work of art. Take the song 'Money'. You can distinctly hear the sounds of coins and cash registers in the background. However, they seem to go along with the beat of the song. This is demonstarted throughout their entire album, which I find amazing. If you are a fan of rock music, any type of music, Pink Floyd, or just want to see why everyone loves this album, then you definetly need to pick this one up. <br /> <br />5/5

0307276902|4.0|Lyrical, poetic prose while reading in some places like a whodunnit, with ever larger revelations being dropped like small bombs into the story as you progress. Well crafted. I have to admit I found the first 100 pages a bit slow and couldn't imagine what all the fuss was about. But the payoffs are enormous as you close in on the end of the book. Halfway through it I finally understood why Oprah chose this book for her book club. Frey is smart, talented and ruthlessly honest.    A word of caution. Frey takes two deeply heretical positions to pull himself into recovery that some readers will find very threatening or politically incorrect. The first is that addiction is a choice, not a disease, and addicts always have it within their power to walk away. The second, which is a logical extension of the first, is that the belief in a Higher Power that 12 step programs require is simply another form of addiction, a fiction recovering addicts choose adopt to replace their drug addiction. Frey rejects both as fake, believing that responsibility for addiction -- or bringing it to heel -- lies solely with the individual. These are not positions I am used to hearing people publicly express. Some readers won't care; some will be angered.    Regardless, this book is worth reading.
B00005JNY4|4.0|I thought this movie was kind of long and SLOW.  But girls if you're fans of Paul Walker, I definitely recommend this movie.  There are PLENTY of scenes with him shirtless and HOT.  He looks ssooooooo good, it makes the movie TOTALLY worth watching.  Over and over and over.... <br /> <br />In the movie, the character played by Paul Walker and his girlfriend, played by Jessica Alba are looking for a sunken ship called the Zephyr, which is worth millions.  No one believes that the Zephyr ever existed so they think that Paul Walker's character's search for treasure is a futile attempt at achieving wealth.  Watch the movie if you have about 2 hours and an eye for the sexy Paul Walker.
B00005JM02|1.0|Nemo is born into the seaworld without mother or siblings but with a crippled fin.

B00001OH7O|5.0|Hello.  If this is the first review by The Curmudgeon that you've read, the above title may seem a little odd. Well, you see, my Amazon schtick involves rating only the very worst DVD's and CD's imaginable. I'm talking reality TV spawned singers. I'm talking lame sequels. Hell, I'm talking Martin Lawrence.<br /><br />But not today. I reached 50 reviews slating the worst things I could find, and so decided for a change of pace for 5 reviews. Here I will review only the very best, the things that makes The Curmudgeon's world all bright, pink and fluffy. Strictly in a macho, hetero way of course. Ahem.<br /><br />So, \\"Hunky Dory\\" by David Bowie. First off, let me squash an unkind assumption, that all of Bowie's more recent works are fairly worthless. They're not at all. His more recent albums have been excellent, and, indeed, it was his jungle-inspired dance song \\"Little Wonder\\" that got me into old weird eyes in the first place.<br /><br />This though, I believe, is his best album. A record of depth, character and considerable humour, it goes from pop perfection, (\\"Changes\\", the chorus of \\"Oh You Pretty Things\\" is simply irresistably bouncy) to heartbreaking (\\"Quicksand\\", quite possibly my favourite every Bowie song). What it lacks in Ziggy Stardust's guitar feedback and snotty attitude, it makes up for in quiet contemplation and honesty, yet still managing to be a superb listening experience.  Years from now you'll still be playing it, still be discovering something new.<br /><br />Hunky Dory is, quite simply, a rock masterclass. Decades ahead of its time (the remastered version, away from some of the hiss and crackle of earlier pressings, sounds like it could have been released yesterday), it raised the bar about twenty notches over everything else. I doubt anyone has ever managed to top it.<br /><br />There. Part three of five. That didn't hurt it, did it? Two more to go, but what, but what?<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B00009W0WM|5.0|Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it? <br /> <br />I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be. <br /> <br />But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (\\"This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!\\") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (\\"What watch?\\"). <br /> <br />But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (\\"I was misinformed.\\") and Claude Rains (\\"I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here\\"). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that thefilm wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple? <br /> <br />About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Caf Amricain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (\\"Vultures everywhere!\\") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the \\"What watch\\"-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, \\"being a German, he would have taken it anyway\\". His performance is simply criminally overlooked. <br /> <br />So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed thatI'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements. <br /> <br />So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!
0440238609|5.0|First you have to open your mind, and put your religious beliefs behind you. <br /> <br />If you do that, this trilogy will blow you away.  It is a fantastic piece of literature.
0385121679|5.0|Okay, granted, I've always heard the book is better than the movie, but I never truly wanted to believe.  I have owned Kubrick's classic since its arrival, and it has always been one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Well, forget the movie, because this book is absolutely unbelievable.  From the very beginning, maybe from anticipation, but most likely from the way Mr. King keeps you on the edge of your seat, bed, hell...on your feet...this book is frightening. <br /> <br />Because of the masterful storytelling and descriptive power, I found myself, after the first night, not wanting to pick this book back up, out of sheer terror.  When I finally talked myself into it, I could not put it down.  Amazing how quiet, yet truly alive, your own home feels, late at night, when there is nothing but your thoughts, awakened by this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Truly unbelievable is the way so very many character's, from Jack, Wendy, Danny and TONY, to Halloran, Lloyd (who could forget good old Lloyd) and the undeniable Grady, are intertwined in a way the movie only begins to uncover. <br /> <br />If you like a good scare, one that wears on you from beginning to end, and truly appreciate the art of imagination, you must give this book a read.  Once you do, you will need to watch the movie, again, just to calm yourself down.
B00003CXS4|5.0|\\"Snatch\\" is a wild ride with a complicated plot that centers on a stolen diamond and 3 different gangs who try to steal it.  This was Guy Ritchie's second film after \\"Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels.\\"  I'm looking forward to Ritchie's \\"Revolver\\" with Jason Statham & Ray Liotta.  Obviously, \\"Swept Away\\" with wife Madonna starring was a misstep.<br /><br />The cast is excellent.  Jason Statham is now a star after the two \\"Transporter\\" films.  As Turkish, he has a droll sense of humor, his own code of ethics and loyalty to his friend Tommy played by Stephen Graham from \\"Gangs of New York.\\"  Turkish serves as the film's narrator.<br /><br />The obvious scene-stealer is Brad Pitt as the nutty Irish boxer Mickey O'Neil.  Since Pitt's breakthrough role in \\"Thelma & Louise\\" back in 1991 and through his Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for \\"12 Monkeys\\" (1995), he's developed into one of Hollywood's brightest stars.  The frustrating and amazingly hilarious schtick here is that you can barely understand a word of the inarticulate Mickey's dialogue, yet all his friends nod and agree profusely.  It really is funny once you get into the swing of noncomprehension.  The fight scenes are also excellent.<br /><br />Somewhat overlooked, but equally impressive is the short cameo of Benicio Del Toro as the Jewish gangster Franky Four Fingers who loves crime but has a weakness for gambling.  Del Toro is obviously a highly regarded actor with his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for \\"Traffic\\" (2000) and his nomination for \\"21 Grams\\" (2003).  His ability to go from Jewish Orthodox to the volatile Frankie demonstrates great range.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones plays Bullet Tooth Tony who is hired to find Frankie.  He does a great job.  Jones was excellent in \\"Swordfish\\" (2001) and is set to appear in next year's \\"X-Men 3.\\"  Lennie James who was in \\"Sahara\\" this year plays Sol who owns the pawnshop and has two bumbling cohorts to help get him in trouble.  Alan Ford who was in \\"American Werewolf in London\\" back in 1981 and in \\"Exorcist: The Beginning\\" last year plays the wild gang leader Brick Top who likes to feed his enemies to the pigs.  Rade Sherbedgia who was in a film \\"Fever\\" (2003) with Vanessa Redgrave & Angelia Jolie (--makes you wonder, eh?--), plays the delightfully sinister Russian gangster Boris the Blade.  Dennis Farina who had a great cameo in the HBO mini-series \\"Empire Falls\\" romps around as Avi.  And of course, the dog that swallows the diamond is also tremendously funny!<br /><br />\\"Snatch\\" is excellent because it combines the MTV-style editing with a complex plot whose unifying element is the stolen diamond.

B00005JNTX|4.0|Let me start by saying I'm not a huge Robert Rodriguez fan.  I've seen a number of his films.  I saw all three of his El Mariachi/Desperado/Once Upon a Time in Mexico trilogy, each time thinking, oh surely I'll like _this_ one.  But I never really was crazy about his stuff.  So when this came out, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it.  And I didn't.<br /><br />Then one night in a hotel room I saw a trailer for it.  And I changed my mind and immediately rented it.  It was visually incredible. It's like you could stop each and every frame of this movie and it would replicate a page from the graphic novel/comic book.  (No, I haven't read any of them, but you can just tell the artistry in framing everything.  It's stunning.)<br /><br />There are some down sides.  It's excruciatingly violent, so if you are offended by that, then obviously stay away.  In addition, I never felt particularly close to any of the characters so when violence happened to them, I didn't really feel anything.  (I am particularly thinking of the Carla Gugino character here.)  I'm not sure if that was deliberate or not, but I wish it had elicited something more from me emotionally.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke was incredible and almost unrecognizeable, but I thought Elijah Wood did a great and creepy job as well.<br /><br />My favorite Rodriguez movie ever.  Hands down.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when family sci-fi members told me of the show.  A gritty wild west sci-fi show about a ship of misfits...I watched the entire series back to back. Loved it. Where is the rest? I hear there is a movie on the way. My thanks to Ken & Alli.
B0007P0LPC|4.0|If you are collecting ballet, this production is highly recommended. If you are a fan of Nureyev and Fonteyne, especially Nureyev, this must be added to your collection. I can only post my honest opinion since I am only starting to be exposed to the great art that is ballet.  <br /> <br />The costumes and stage settings are on a grand scale, top notch. The color theme is very earthy, except for the prince and the swans. The various guests at the prince's birthday celebrations all dress elaborately and those who study costume design, I must recommend this to you.  <br /> <br />The way the story is told is mainly from the prince's point of view, and there are a lot of Nureyev's solos. Great solos they are too. So strong and graceful. His high jumps and fierce spinning will catch anyone's breath. However, there was so much of his solo and not Fonteyne's. I felt that this was a little unfair. From beginning to the very end of the death scene, the story focuses mainly on the tragedy of the prince. I must also add, that death scene is one of the coolest thing I have ever seen done on stage!!! I get chills every time.  <br /> <br />The first appearance of Fonteyne is also a sight to behold. She truly embodies the tragic swan princess. Their Pas De Duexs are not to be missed. Corps de Ballet is also a highlight of this DVD. The swans enter the stage endlessly, and dance like they were one soul. My favorite is the four swans dancing, hand in hand...I'm sorry, I am still studying and I do not know what this is called.  <br /> <br />This is not a recording of a live production, and therefore, there are no applause between the scenes. This also allows camera angles that would not be allowed otherwise.  <br /> <br />Classic ballet it is. Swan Lake a ballet lover must have. This one has Nureyev written all over it.  <br />
0671027344|5.0|I'm 18 and I always feel comforted or inspired or in a place of wisdom after i read this book. While I'll admit that some issues in it bothered me, I was moved by Charlie's insight, his genuine love for Sam, the relationship with his friends and mentor and just being the misfit that took a stand. I find MTV really lame and pointless, but this is a beautiful story. We all can relate to Charlie somehow. Certain profound lines in the book just grab you by your heartstrings, if you listen to the music from the book it matches the moments and you fall in love with the characters rapidly. I have like 3 favorite parts in this book I can't choose between. Definitely my favorite. I lent it to my best guy friend and he fell in love with it too. It makes an interesting topic for conversation. So to the author, I don't think the rape and drug use was necessary, but I loved how fearlessly you wrote this book with such raw honesty. Good for you :)   <br /> <br />

0316666343|4.0|This remarkable novel gets off to a rough start as 14-year-old Susie Salmon's neighbor man, George Harvey, brutally rapes and murders her, and to our dismay, gets away with it.  From Heaven, Susie narrates the entire book as she watches her family (parents and two siblings) shatter into pieces while slowly tracking their lives as well as those of several friends over the next 15 years or so.  The writing is vivid and emotional, and many a reader will shed tears along the way as the family grieves their way into breakdown.<br /><br />We thought the first half of the story a little better than the second.  Sebold did a fine job revealing the frustration and suffering of the family members, and how in turn they each coped differently.  What happened to some of Susie's friends was also entertaining, as they \\"came of age\\" in various ways.  During the latter half, we were a little disappointed that the story bogged down - and despite various buildups, several opportunities to identify and catch the killer, find the poor girl's body, and give all the characters some ultimate satisfaction were passed over by the author, leaving us somewhat unsettled as well.  Moreover, an unusual love scene near the conclusion seemed really wrong and out of place, somewhat destroying the \\"magic\\" of the heavenly narration by an out of context earthly event.  And we weren't sure that the family reunion at the end was as likely as portrayed.<br /><br />But - a 2300-reviewer 4-star rating can't be all wrong.  Many a provocative scene depicts the good and bad of life, and rarely have we seen a novel so delicately interweave both hope and despair.  The author's perception (or at least creative expression) of what Heaven is like is certainly different and less utopian than typical.  Maybe that people seem to want to talk about \\"Lovely Bones\\" long after putting it down may be the best recommendation of all!
B00008IHN1|4.0|What an amazing video. We saw the movie on television and needed to purchase the video to see it again. The drumline is amazing!

B000AMWIVM|1.0|The movie starts out kinda good (first 1/2 hour). Gets lost in the middle with Danny Glover running around for no reason. His character in the movie seemed pointless and reminded me in a small way of Glover in Predator 2 (sweaty and bloody, but not in as good of shape). Anyway, the acting was horrible (Cary was the WORST) and the ending was VERY predictable. If you bought this before DO NOT buy it again! If you didn't buy the first release do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this one either. Severed thumbs way down!!!
0740748475|5.0|And, in my opinion, no other strip is even close.  None was consistently funny over the years as Calvin & Hobbes.  It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since Watterson retired.  It's my understanding that he is living in sem-seclusion, very rarely granting interviews (although he did for the release of this set) and spending his time painting with no desire to return to a full-time strip.  His enigmatic departure at the height of the strip's popularity will forever cement his fame.  He's the Barry Sanders and Jim Brown of Comic strips.  It's like if Charles Schulz had abruptly retired in the early 1970's.<br /><br />The Detroit Free Press has just begun reprinting Calvin & Hobbes strips and will continue for the rest of the year.  This is a great thing for perhaps younger readers who may not have been familiar with the characters.  The strip is so simple really...a boy and his stuffed tiger who Calvin imagines (or does he?) comes to life when just the two of them are together.  Calvin's over-active imagination takes them on a wild ride of adventures but some of the very best strips are when the pair are just lying about, philosophizing about life in general or picking out shapes in the clouds.<br /><br />My personal favorites were always the holiday strips, expecially the Christmas strips as Calvin was always scheming for presents or to catch Santa as he comes down the chimney.  I still love reading those.  This set collects every Calvin & Hobbes strip.  All ten years worth in a handsome three volume set.  It's a great collectors item but it's also great for reading.  It's definitely cheaper to buy this complete set than to try and buy all of the smaller collection books.  A fantastic Christmas present.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I am a die hard Final Fantasy VII fan.<br /><br />And I have played several other RPGs, console and PC.<br /><br />Even the older Nintendo ones.<br /><br />But the storyline in FFVII was just mesmerizing.<br /><br />I just received the imported version but I will be buying the north american version. Hopefully they do not cut parts out like they mangle a lot of other good foreign films. (blame our wussy fcc, other countries have more violence in movies but less violent crime -- go figure).<br /><br />I will not give away the plot, but if you love FFVII you will enjoy this movie.<br /><br />It was like reentering the game with the familiar characters.<br /><br />The fight scenes were marvelous.<br /><br />I have import films from Anime to Romance and this film is one of my all tiem favorites. Stunnign graphics and cool storyline.<br /><br />Until they bring out a Street Fighter CG movie with AKUMA, make mine Final Fantasy VII.<br /><br />P.S.  We need a new PS2 or PS3 game made to continue the Saga. much like the matrix series.  FFVII-2 anyone?<br /><br />Sephiroth Rules !!!!
B0006IIKS0|2.0|I don't care what merits this has as a documentary _ actually I'd say it's alright _ but let me just say that Cliff Burton, the personification of balls, must be rolling over in his grave right now. The higher you rise the harder you fall _ and these guys have long been done as a significant band. Still, gotta give props for what they've accomplished because records like Lightning and Puppets have and always will stand the test of time. No one will ever make a more genre defining or essential metal record than those two. I'd like to think they'll once again enter a studio with strong material and leave Bob Rock at home _ but it's not going to happen. If anything, this film just solidifies the fact that I will never spend a cent on anything they ever record again. Oh wait I haven't done that since '91. Watch it if you're interested in witnessing the pratfalls of fame, or if you really want to see what a snobby rich-boy douche Lars really is. I mean a Basquiat???? Are you kidding me????
B00008PC2O|1.0|I just payed very little for this but still, what is the point?  There are bairly any special features on Disc 2 other than a bunch of DVD rom CRAP.  The only way to watch the theatrical version of the film is to make sure Inter Actual (rolls eyes) will run the disc (which it won't for my computer and it makes me really really mad).  For some reason the Special Edition is the main attraction with 16 minutes of added scenes I guess.  It really makes me mad though since there is only one way to see the theatrical version, and that is through a pesky computer that will become outdated along with the programs, and eventually there will be no way to watch the theatrical version of the film.  The whole point of this DVD is apparently to have the best visual representation of the film, yet it is only for the Special Edition.  Sure, the theatrical edition in \\"high definition\\" on a computer would probably be good too, but there is no way to watch it unless everything on your computer is compatible to what Van Ling wants it to be compatible with.  VERY FRUSTRATING
B000B0WODA|4.0|This has to be the catchiest album of the year.  Not quite the best album of the year, but close.  Haven't decided if it is better than their debut or not, but I love the way it expands their sound in new directions but still stays true to their sound (they can mix-up their sound on their third album).<br /><br />Their debut was all about reviving dancey post-punk.  This album retains that core of dancey post-punk but expands to include harder rock (The Fallen), punk (Evil and a Heathen), new wave (Do You Want To), jangle pop (Walk Away) and Beatlesque ballads (Eleanor Put Your Boots On, Fade Together).  Not to mention I'm Your Villain, which is probably their most ambitious song, but encapsulates what Franz is all about.  Highly recommended.
B00004RFFS|4.0|There were a series of things around this movie that turned me off when it was first released.  Firstly, I can admit I was not framiliar with Anne Rice's work before she met mainstream success.  Couple that with the fact that they had chosen Tom Cruise to play Lestat and Anne Rice was vehemiently opposed to it made me question both this movie's integrity and quality.  I was pleasently surprised, however, that this wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. <br /> <br />Brad Pitt, in perhaps his best preformance (double for Tom Cruise), plays the broading, reflective Louis, a two hundred year old vampire who is telling his story to an interviewer, played by Christian Slater (in perhaps his last noteworthy role, ironically).  Louis is lonely, that's for sure, and hopes that by telling his tale that he will somehow atone for all the good and bad he's been through as well as caused during his two hundred year exile. <br /> <br />Louis takes us through a sweeping epic, crossing time and history.  Already depressed over the death of his wife and child, he is hoping for death when he meets Lestat and is given the gift/curse of eternal life.  Lestat, obviously lonely for a companion as well, makes Louis immortal yet keeps him at his side without being the best teacher because he wants Louis to stay dependent on him.  Later on, they create a sort of odd family when they bring an orphaned girl whose mother had died in some sort of epidemic, Claudia.  This family is dysfunctional, to say the least.  Eventually tired of Lestat's codependency and controlling nature, Claudia and Louis eliminate him and flee to France to start anew.  Here in France they meet another group of vampires in a macabre theater.  Claudia, as she did Lestat, grows weary of Louis and craves a new companion, but when the new companion is created the theater vampires take their revenge.  Claudia and her new companion are fried up in the sunlight, and Louis, deprived of his lady love, is left truly alone. <br /><br />This is a tradgic tale as much as it is a fantasy.  Louis is an unusual vampire, as he seems to have more respect for human life than his counterparts.  He chooses to go through eternity alone, as it's best for him and the world around him.  I liked the aspect of being able to live forever, slogging through time and seeing the world as it changes.  But, Louis is still a monster, he's not the hero of the story even though he's the main character.  And the acting on all parties is a little on the hokey side, but then again the dialogue is preachy and a little silly too.  Kristen Dunst, although only a child when she made this movie, stood out as the femme fatale innocent child, an immortal Lolita if there ever was such a thing.  The sets, make up and wardrobe make for a lush atmosphere. <br /> <br />I've never been a goth girl, still am not, and have no desires to be, but this was right on in the most mainstream of horror / gothic movies as you can get.  Enjoy it for it's scenery and insights into the world of the undead.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|When a band puts out a Greatest Hits package, one of two things has happened: They are moving onto the next chapter of their music careers, or they are caput and have decided to put a period on the sentance.  The second is what the case is for Guns N' Roses. <br /> <br />Purchasing a Greatest Hits package, on the other hand, is also a tenative venture.  If you were already a fan, you probably already have all their greatest hits in your collection and they are pulling you in with the promise of a digitally remastered version of something you already own with one or two floater songs you didn't get.  I discourage people from buying Greatest Hits packages if they have potential to explore all the great stuff that wasn't a radio single.  Don't limit yourselves, people!  There is a whole universe out there that the radio never played!  If you have a passing knowledge of said band and really aren't all that interested in anything but the radio singles, then go ahead and buy, this is really all you need.   <br /> <br />Guns N'Roses had some great songs.  Their peers from this era (Poison, Motley Crue, etc) might have sounded similar and charted as high as they did, but their music is the one and only that has truly endured because it was the greatest.  They had hard rock stadium anthems that still can whip a crowd into a frenzy if played today.  Though they had some personal problems (to put it mildly) that keep them from reunion tours, they perhaps have the most dignity by not continuing to tour on 80s revivals or nostalgia summer tours.  They produced some true classics and are letting them remain as such. <br /> <br />Here we see the monster hits as well as the rather curious that we still can't explain.  From their glory days of \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" and the \\"Illusion\\" albums, we see the one and only single released from their all covers album of \\"The Spaghetti Insident?\\" and their cover of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" from the Interview With The Vampire soundtrack,their last group effort.  \\"The Spaghetti Insident?\\" left the audiences a little confused as to why they felt the need to put out an album of all covers, the Rolling Stones cover sealed their fate.  Appropriate now that I think of it, considering the movie theme as well as their last gasp. <br /> <br />If you are 18 and under and have only heard a few of these songs, then this is a fine addition to your collection.  For those of us who were there at their peak of glory, it's a period on the sentance.  Some might want to buy if they didn't get the Rolling Stones cover, otherwise it's just another Greatest Hits package.
B0000667RO|5.0|This album ROCKS! What a wonderful collection this is... <br />Includes everything from Everything I do to summer of 69' and cloud nine and many other hits. A must buy if you haven't heard Bryan Adams before!
B00006690G|1.0|Eminem has no musical skills.  All of his productions are awful.  There is nothing more to say, it is that simple, really.  Without MTV, nothing could have sold this guy.  That's why he writes songs about himself to remind you how tough and cool he is in case you were intelligent enough to realize he is a dork.  And a poser.  <br />  <br />Fin.
B000002JPA|5.0|And the best to start! I love this album, Kevin Moore rules! Best song is 4.
B00004T9UF|1.0|This guy is talentless. He's on MTV yet mocks MTV. Hypocrite. He writes songs about himself and how hard his life is/was. Redundant. He writes songs about people that don't like him/he doesn't like. Boring. The songs are stale, the beats are wannabe, and the voice/lyrics are really stupid. Eminem is for kids who don't know any better. If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you. <br /> <br />Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each \\"song\\". Please throw away your Eminem material. Don't sell it, just toss it. Thre is NO WAY that Eminem is cool.  After a few years pass and the kiddies grow up, this will be (already is) an abomination to music collections through time.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is a great concept album. The songs tell about a great story in which can find out about in other reviews. Best song: ALL of them!
B000002AZ8|5.0|\\"Can't buy what I want, because it's free,\\" wails out the distressed frontman, Eddie Vedder, of one of the biggest bands in the mid-90's. If only everyone understood Pearl Jam. How much better off would the world be? Not at all, and that was Pearl Jams' main goal on this album. To seperate themselves and their true fans from the rest of the world. This was the last Pearl Jam album to receive large record sales, and sadly, only their 3rd studio album.  <br /> <br />This album is a creative gem. Yes, some songs may be toooo creative/abstract (Hey Foxy..., Bugs, Pry to), but this is Pearl Jams' songwriting and Vedders' lyrics near their peak (peak was No Code, IMO). Vedders vocals are also very strong here, but, as you can see, his style alters greatly (see: Nothingman). <br /> <br />Nothingman, Cordouroy, Betterman, and Immortality are all among the best songs of the 90's, no matter how objectively you think about. They all contain what is also some of Vedders' finest lyricism. \\"Satans Bed\\" is my personal favorite of this album, and it contains another great guitar solo from Sir Mike McCready. The rest of the album contains songs which are mainstays for the hardcore Pearl Jam fans (much like myself), and a few flatout songs that make you say- \\"WTF were they thinking????!?!?!?!? Yeah, those are Pry to, Bugs, and Stupid Mop (aka Hey Foxy...).  <br /> <br />If you're looking for one of the most difficult and challenging albums of our time, then look no further than here. If you are not going to listen to this album with an open mind and heart, then please, go listen to another band. Pearl Jam bashers are far too common.
B000002JKA|5.0|I love this album, Scarred is wnough of a reason to buy this album!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|i got this cd awhile ago, back in like june, and of all my cds i've had over the years, i believe i have listened to this one (the ENTIRE album) more times than any of the others. i still love Toxicity, its one of my favorite albums still. i don't know what it is about this album, but i LOVE it! EVERY songs is fantastic! (*giggle*) perhaps the last song or 2 are a little weak, but weak for SOAD means kick-... well, you get the idea. a MUST have!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|It's all here! At least for me, Friends is the best TV show ever...it has everything you can ask for, laugh, romance, tragedy... It's a real shame that it's over, but let me tell you, I've been a Friends fan since 2003 (9th season), and I really missed half of my life along with Friends, and ever since, I've bought almost all the seasons separately, and let me tell you that if you get this or any season, you'll NEVER GET SICK OF WATCHING IT!!! It's the best DVD you could own. FRIENDS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY!!!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|Haven't seen the DVD yet, but the movie was \\"The BEST Movie Ever\\", according to one seven year old who is not easily impressed by movies.  From an adult point of view, it is pretty corny...but the scene where the villians are struggling with infant car seats is a classic!
0312323859|5.0|\\"Something Blue\\" is a wonderful follow-up to Emily Giffin's first novel \\"Something Borrowed\\". It's  honest, heartbreaking, and makes you laugh out loud. I recommend this book to anyone who needs to be reminded what love and friendship is all about. \\"Something Blue\\" is a great read... One that you can't put down.
B0000DIJO2|4.0|This disc is preferable to \\"Bee Gees - Live by Request (2001)\\", cause there's no irritating MC in it. Good sound (DTS), but the downside is that it's not widescreen. <br /> <br />
0321213351|3.0|The lack of full source code makes it hard to see the big picture of what the author is trying to convey. It doesn't even have a CD nor a link to a page where you can try and download the snippets he has in the book. These drawbacks prompted me to rate this book to 3 stars, though it could have been better had he provided those resources that could reinforce the concepts, and of course for me to test them.
B000A2X9ZQ|2.0|My dad lent me this book to read, so I thought I'd watch the video to see how it translated.  The book is pretty farfetched (Abraham Lincoln ends up in the African desert?, they just happen to come upon a vanished flyer's plane?), but I liked it much more than the video. I can see why the author would be upset with the film.  Too much Penelope Cruise (her character's hardly in the book and ends up in a wheelchair in the end - not in a bikini on the beach) and where the heck did she get a different outfit for every scene out of a small carry on bag?  The villians aren't too villanous, the whole section about the old fort is missing, and there was no gold left on the ship (carted out by tribesmen after all the original shipmates died - a much  more believeable premise).  I guess it makes an OK straight to video release, but if you're looking for the book on film, this sure isn't it.  I'll end up buying a copy to sent to my dad so I can hear him rant - that's always fun!
B000002JKA|5.0|This album is the best album of the 90's AND of all time! Best songs are A Mind Beside Itself (the whole thing), The Mirror, and Space-Dye Vest.
0802713319|4.0|I was hoping that this book would be to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem what The Elegant Universe is to string theory: a good overview of the topic accessible to a layperson.  In that respect, this book failed to meet my expectations.  While it does discuss the logic behind the proof in the broadest possible terms, this book is primarily a historical account of the theorem and the people who have contributed to its proof.  In this respect, the book is a success.  The author does an excellent job telling the human side of this story.
B000002JPA|5.0|Proves they made the right move in hiring him! Pull Me Under kicks so much ass!
0393317552|1.0|The author cleary has an agenda.  He is out to prove that no group of people is any \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any other group.  To meet this end, he argues that geography and geography alone is responsible for the success of some cultures and the failure of others.   <br /> <br />Sure, geography might be the correct explanation.  Another possible explanation, and one that is far simpler, is that some groups of people, on average, innately possess abilities that others don't.  In today's day and age, this is very politically incorrect.  Nonetheless, it should be addressed. <br /> <br />The author does address this latter theory.  It takes him about a page and half to dismiss it based not on science, not on any sort of study, but on his personal observation that certain aboriginal people, who belong to cultures we might not find advanced, are in fact more intelligent, on average, than caucasians.  He came to this conclusion by observing their ability to navigate through the woods (and the fact that their children don't grow up watching TV). <br /> <br />To me, this isn't science.  In fact, it's junk science invented to affirm the author's personal views.
B000021XS0|5.0|All else you need to know: Fatal Tregedy ALONE is enough to buy this album! Buy this with I&W and Awake.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|There's nothing like a soul singer who plays the piano, and like Aretha and Roberta before her, Alicia Keys knows how to take possession of keyboards and work her voice around her playing. This disc, while not \\"Unplugged\\" in the technical sense, gives Alicia a chance to shine, and her playing and singing are impeccable. <br />All the hits are here (\\"Falling\\" still sounds great, and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" beats the original in this production), along with some clever covers - her version of \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" is right up there with Brenda Holloway's original, and while some Stones purists might balk, I really enjoyed the version of \\"Wild Horses\\" on this project. And the closing number \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\", a Damian Marley song that features he and Keys, along with Common and Mos Def is a perfect wrap for this show. <br />Truly great stuff, from a performer who is maturing into a true artist.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I loved it. It's different and you must have an open mind going into the film. I got my mom who is 75 to watch it and she liked it too.
B00008IHN1|2.0|I liked this movie... until I really learned how to drum.    The playing isn't clean, the focus is not on drumline but on snare line (ok, ok, I play tenors so I'm biased), and there is virtually no story.  If you are impressed by this, go watch some DCI and WGI videos so you can see that this movie is laughable.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it at least HAS drums in it and it beats watching other really, really boring movies; also, I am ashamed to admit that I was entertained by it for a little while, until I learned more.  But don't try to watch this specifically to learn how to drum/march/be in band... go get a pad and sticks and a decent teacher and some DCI/WGI vids.
015603252X|4.0|Others have written what this book is about, so I will not try to describe the content of this book.  Like the way he presented his mother, Amos Oz is a born story teller and a great painter with words.  There is not a place, a person or an activity but that he presents it in such detail that you can actually SEE them.  But I must say that often I found the detail excessive.  He seems to have total recall, which is often rewarding but can at other times be a bit of a bore. He tells you the number of steps leading up into a house; he describes the smallest objects in a room without asking himself whether they are truly necessary to establish the room's atmosphere; he is inordinately fond of lists.  Here, for instance, is a sentence describing his mother working silently and efficiently in the house:  &#34;She cooked, baked, did the washing, put the shopping away, ironed, cleaned, tidied, washed the dishes, sliced vegetables, kneaded dough.&#34; His aunts, who tell him about the family's life in Poland, also seem to have had total recall: that life is richly reconstructed, but again for my taste the pudding is often over-egged. Then he describes in minute detail and several times exactly which streets he or his mother would take from one location in Jerusalem to another.  That might possibly be evocative for Jerusalemites who know the city; but if they know the city, do they need such a guide?  These tiresome excesses are most in evidence when he describes his earliest years, until he is about eight years old; but those chapters take up  about 2/3rds of this massive book (though his tale is never entirely chronological).  Then, when he is eight, the War of Independence happens (excellent description of Jerusalem under siege), to be followed by the establishment of the State of Israel, and now the narrative becomes rather more concentrated and  with fewer of the mannerisms of the earlier part.  There is a magnificent description how, at the age of 15,  this pale, immensely precocious cerebral but romantic youth escapes from the stifling intellectual world  represented by his father and his father's friends, to live among the bronzed young gods on a kibbutz.  He will stay on that kibbutz for the next 31 years, but his story ends with his adolescent admiration of the goddess who will become his wife five or six years later.  And that is where, chronologically, his story ends (though throughout the book there are brief references to events in his later life).<br /><br />This is a totally inadequate account of the book, and does not even  touch on the thread that runs throughout: his relationship with his parents and their relationship with each other.  Despite the irritations I sometimes felt, I was never tempted to put the book aside: it is far too interesting and well-written for that.sely precocious cerebral but romantic youth escapes from the stifling intellectual world  represented by his father and his father's friends, to live among the bronzed young gods on a kibbutz.

B0001HLVS2|4.0|Made for a very quick 2 hours, this film.  There really is nothing bad to say about it, it is solid and well made in all departments as one might expect from a fine director like Peter Weir.<br /><br />I became interested in this movie mainly from some audio forums which suggested it as a good test of one's home theater system, and not only did this film fit that bill but it was actually not at all your typical brain-dead, cliche-ridden, FX-dependent Hollywood action flick at all.  Even the ending had a slight twist to it, there were remarkably very few predictable plot turns which is quite remarkable in this genre.  A minimum of cheesiness, thank God---no artificially contrived romantic or family-oriented subplot, no moronic paens to machismo or jingoism...it's pleasantly well-balanced and self-restrained.<br /><br />I don't think Russel Crowe has starred in a bad movie yet...
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is a rare book indeed. It is based on the life of Lin - the author - and tells the tale of his escape from prison, his new life in the slums of India, his involvement with the mob, and his adventures as a soldier in afganistan. It is a huge book, but will go by fast as the story is all engrossing. Lin meets many people people in his travels, some wonderful and magical, others dark and dangerous. He tries to atone for his past life, but fate has a way of following people seeking retribution. No matter how hard a person tries to atone, the devil is there to lead you astray.

B000AL730O|5.0|Like any other album, there are of course songs that aren't as good as others. Rarely in the history of music has an ENTIRE album been excellent. Certain songs appeal to different people.  <br /> <br />I'll admit that listening to it the first time I was unimpressed, but after a few listens I can honestly say that I think this is his best work since The Beatles. There have been some scattered masterpieces throughout his career, but some of the songs on this album are simply awesome! \\"Jenny Wren\\" as someone else said, is the \\"Blackbird\\" of 2005. <br /> <br />Whatever, blah blah blah, I highly recommend this album and can't wait to see Paul in concert in 3 weeks!
B00005JO0J|5.0|I was a little concerned that the series and Wheadon's brand of wit\comedy would not translate well to the big screen.  My worries turned out to be completely unfounded.  The movie was a gem.<br /><br />Featuring intelligent dialogue and wonderfully developed characters, Serenity manages to make an interesting and fresh foray into a genre that has been victimized by mediocrity on so many occasions.  Truly, Serenity proves that a great movie is first and foremost about the writing.<br /><br />A great script, wonderful acting, and outstanding direction make Serenity one the best sci-fi feature films of the past 2 decades.  Highly recommended to all.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The first time I heard this album was when I dropped a phonograph needle on Bill Brasky's nipple. Ever since then, I've been hooked. You won't disappointed, whether you buy the CD or listen to the original Brasky recording.
0060989157|5.0|I'm not the fastest reader but in one weekend I flew through the 400+ pages of this confessional/biography book. The book shifts between time frames, characters (band members, managers, friends, etc.) narrations, and bio facts to amusing and crazy stories pretty much each chapter. But it does this in a very cohesive way that makes this one of those books that is interesting and easy to blaze through. Whether for good or not, after reading this book it will definitely change your attitude and the way you act when you cruise the town. Not many books can do this but this book really will affect you...at least for a week or so.
B000AL730O|1.0|After I bought the cd, I put it into the cd player and cruised down the highway expecting some good stuff. What I got made me yearn for \\"Octopus's Garden\\", \\"Your Mother Should Know\\", or maybe even something from Yoko.... and I've always liked McCartney!    I hated it. It was drivel. It was weak lyrically and musically. Sir Paul was trying to be Sir Mathis. If I wanted syrup, I'd listen to my wife's Josh Groban collection. (Naw, that's asking too much.)    Fortunately, by the time I got home, I put in \\"I am the Walrus\\" and I woke from my near coma.
B0007G89G4|5.0|This movie is about four boys Chris,Gordie,Teddy,and Vern. <br />Chris is the one with crappy parents and A bad reputation.Gordie is the quiet one the writer.Teddy is the rather odd one because his father held his ear to A stove and burnt it off.Vern is the fat kid who is funny and A bit dim.One day while sitting in there tree house Vern comes up and tells the rest of the gang he has overheard where the missing kids dead body is so they all travel to find it so they can be hero's and stuff along the way they battle leech's trains and the heart ache of growing up. <br />I loved this movie the first thing I thought when I saw it was man those are some bad kids I mean they cuse there heads off,smoke,and play with guns.Anyway the ending was true you will never have friends like you did when you were twelve.

0156027321|3.0|I found Life of Pi a very interesting book. I rate the book a three because I was very disappointed with the ending. I did not like that I had to pick between which story I believed was true. The ending made me feel like I wasted my time reading the first 381 pages of the book. I thought the ending would tell more about Pi's adult life. In chapter 36, the reader is introduced to Pi's children. This gave me the impression that the end of the book would show how Pi went on with his life after the seven months spent in a boat with a tiger. I also was very confused on how in the beginning of Part II, Pi tells the reader that the sun had destroyed his clothes, but towards the end of his journey on the boat Pi tells the reader that he uses his shirt as a wet rag to put on his face to cool him down. How is it possible that the sun disintegrated his shirt in the beginning of the book, but Pi was able to use it again towards the end of the book? After reading the entire book, I was struck with numerous questions similar to the one above. I did, however, like most of the book. I found the beginning very interesting. I like learning about the three different religions Pi wanted to be. I was able to see the way Pi thought giving me a better perspective on three different religions. Pi helped me see how all of them had some factor in common. I also liked how Pi was a struggling young teen just like everyone else. He struggled with his name and which religion he should become. Many young teens struggle with similar issues. In the book, Pi shows the reader how he overcomes this struggle. He has the courage to go in front of his whole class and change his name. He also has the courage to tell his family that he wants to become three different religions. I believe everyone would benefit by reading this book. The author writes in a way that makes the reader feel like he/she is in the boat with Pi.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|We live in an age where music that sounds exactly the same gets popular and rich while music that sounds completely different gets critical acclaim and respect. <br /> <br />Music reviewers get off by listening to music and immediately likening it to other artists they know, creating a proverbial MY music knowledge is BIGGER THAN YOURS contest. When a few reviewers listen to a few sample tracks and here a similarity to another, better-known band, they can't help but contain their orgasm of joy in getting to show people how elitist they can be by claiming its \\"all been done before\\" and sounding off musical references.  Then everyone saves time by listening to the hype before listening to the music, and continue the trend because \\"all the cool kids are doing it\\". <br /> <br />If you're not a bandwagon type, give Muse a real listen. Stop thinking Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, or whoever else you've heard, and listen to the majesty of Muse. <br /> <br />Just because Bellamy decides to sing in the treble clef, or occasionally in falcetto, all of a sudden he's SHAMLESSLY STEALING MATERIAL from Yorke? Listen to Bends and OK Computer, then listen to Absolution (and Origin of Symmetry and Showbiz), and you will find two bands that are VERY different. <br /> <br />So what if they have influences, ranging as vastly as Rufus Wainwright to Rachmaninoff? This band simply sounds amazing.  Their melodies blend like a strawberry smoothie. It is the most powerful, yet catchy (not a bad thing as dumbass Music Reviewers and Indie Punks like to bitch about) music i've ever heard. <br /> <br />Bellamy is a genius as well...singer, piano, guitar, he surpasses almost any i've seen, on those individual instruments of sound, and he seamlessly plays all three. <br /> <br />And for anyone who's had the amazing pleasure of seeingthe band that won Best Live Show in England, you will understand this music better than most. <br /> <br />I wont do a song for song analysis of this CD, but ifind the beginning songs to be the best. Apocalypse Now is an amazing intro, then there's the amazing Stockholm Syndrome and Hysteria, both with great riffs.  Butterflies and Hurricanes is my favorite, and it really portrays Bellamy's genius on piano. Time is Running Out is probably the catchiest (and a crowd favorite live), and finally Sing for Absolution is an aptly strong ballad. <br /> <br />This is a great CD, though I will say that the dramatic quality of it all may be a bit much for some listeners who can't take that much adrenaline, in which case I recommend Origin of Symmetry, a slightly more varied album, which if it doesn't match Absolution in power, it surpasses it in amazing melodies. <br /> <br />I will also say that while Bellamy might not belt out the best lyrics of the era, they are wholly appropriate for the music, and are merely an \\"outlet for Bellamy's voice\\", as one reviewer put it.  I guess they aren't always wrong...
B000A5044C|3.0|\\"Nobody Knows\\" shows the slow descent of four shockingly abandoned children into an urban savagery of sorts.  It's a harrowing tale, all the more so because it's based on real events.  The script is subtle and well-played by the actors.  You learn, for example, that  Mom's brood comes from four different fathers, none Nobel Prize winners.  In one telling sequence of scenes, the two candidates (a Pachinko gallery worker and taxi driver) who potentially sired the littlest daughter both try to distance themselves from any sense of responsibility.<br /><br />If you read between the lines at some of the critics' reviews (\\"unfolds with leisurely beauty\\") of \\"Nobody Knows,\\" what you'll divine is that the film is overly long by about 20 - 30 minutes.  It could have used a good editor.  And, this is one of those movies where you watch and say to each other \\"okay, good rental, but I'd be perturbed if I paid $8.50 a ticket at the theater.\\"<br /><br />That aside, the acting by the four child protagonists is at a very high level, especially that Yûya Yagira, who portrays the eldest son; you can literally see the wight of responsibility eating away at this kid as the movie progresses.  It's a fairly astounding acting job.
0060537639|3.0|If you're really interested in these issues, I highly recommend that (before or in addition to reading this book) you read the review by Robert Finlay in the Journal of World History v.15 no.2 pp.229ff (June 2004) (Go to the nearest state college or univeristy library).  In his detailed review, Finlay does what scholars are supposed to do and cites sources for all his points!  Decide for yourself.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The best superhero movie of all time.  I don't have any idea how they are going to top this one with the sequel, but I can't wait to find out.
B00008WG3U|1.0|These guys have become the type of people that they use to make fun of (see liberal animation). I think it had something to do with them moving to the liberal wonderland of san francisco where they celebrate \\"diversity\\" but hate you if you're not just like them! tolerance? yeah right! once upon a time these guys use to play some great punk rock, check out RIBBED, S&M AIRLINES and LIBERAL ANIMATION instead of this mindless junk. And by the way, if BUSH lied about the war, then so did John Kerry, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Ted Kennedy, And even Saddam Hussein himself thought he had nukes, but he was duped by his own man who was later beheaded by Saddam's son.

THIS IS PURE BUBBLE GUM POP FOR THE AMERICAN IDIOTS WHO JUST EAT UP WHATEVER IS FORCED DOWN THEIR THROATS BY MTV, CLEAR CHANNEL AND BIG MONEY-MAKERS IN ARMANI SUITS. PLEASE PEOPLE, WAKE UP AND START THINKIN FOR YOURSELF. THERE IS A LOT OF GREAT MUSIC OUT THERE. IF YOU LIKE PUNK, TRY: BAD BRAINS, CRO-MAGS, MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, AGNOSTIC FRONT, SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, BIG BOYS, DEAD BOYS OR SOME NEWER BANDS LIKE PROJECT 86, NO INNOCENT VICTIM, DODGIN BULLETS, STAVESACRE, ANYTHING BUT THIS! THESE IDIOTS ARE NO MORE PUNK THAN (...)!
B000B0WODA|5.0|Not too crazy about the lead off single `Do you want to' (a noisy unsuccessful attempt to recreate `Take me out') off Franz Ferdinand's sophomore set, I must admit, and I was rather worried the rest of the album would be the same. However, one listen to the new CD `You could have it so much better' allayed my fears. They have still got it!!!<br /><br />These four lads from Scotland can still rock out and make you dance like crazy. This is the follow up to their US platinum and UK quadruple platinum debut. Still haven't decided if I like it better than the debut but I love it!<br /><br />While still sticking to their original template, they manage to get in a Beatles-esque sound on the stunning ballad `Eleanor Put Your Boots On'. There's the piano drenched epic `Fade together', and the lovely, jangly `Walk away'.<br /><br />Cranking up the tempo are the Bowie-like sexy `I'm your villain', `The fallen', `Outsiders', the infectious `This boy' (love the intro riff), and the creepy, pulsing rocker `Evil and a heathen' (with distorted vocals).<br /><br />Vocally and lyrically, this is up there with their debut; witty, funny, innuendo laden. Brilliant!!!
B000002A3T|5.0|This is the only review I've written on Amazon and it might be the last, but after reading the editorial review of this album I had to disagree with the writer. I love Pink Floyd, and of the eleven Pink Floyd albums I own, this album is my favorite to listen to straight through, uninterrupted.  Every single song is wonderful and affecting. I can't believe that anybody could listen to the soaring, dream-like \\"Marooned\\" for instance, and still describe the guitar work as 'uninspired' -- it practically puts me in a trance!  Along with Comfortably Numb it might be my favorite Pink Floyd song.  \\"Keep Talking\\" and \\"High Hopes\\" are also highlights, but the whole album is excellent.  I highly recommend The Division Bell, along with the more traditionally heralded Pink Floyd albums (DSotM, The Wall, etc.) - you won't be disappointed.

B000002JKA|5.0|Just read Dan's review. Best songs: The Mirror, Lie, Voices, Scarred.
B0002OERI0|5.0|You probably won't find a better written, better played, better produced pop/rock record anywhere. If you're dragging the baggage of what Green Day used to put out and what it meant to you as an angry kid, you're going to stay angry. On the other hand, the songs explode out of the speakers at you, the lyrics are good, and the playing is outstanding. A great sounding album.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I think it's hilarious that after all the times the release has been delayed, Amazon.com listed the final release date to the year 2025! That sounds about right. Anyways, I saw the Japanese version w/ subtitles, and subsequently soiled myself as a physiological reaction to the animation and special effects, plot points, character appearances, and some other bits and pieces. All I have left to say that has not yet been said is, I want the FF battle victory ringtone! Dun dun dun da dunnnn dunnnn dun da daaaaaaaaaaaaa!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I am very much looking forward to receiving the 4-disk Special Edition of the movie, which I'm ordering from Amazon.co.uk because I have a \\"universal\\" DVD player and want the complete set.

Is branching going to be hard to do??  I've never heard this term before, and have not seen Lord of the Rings.... <br /> <br />Thanks for any help you can provide!!
1400032717|3.0|This book, to me, was a mixed bag.  It was somewhat interesting, somewhat tedious and somewhat entertaining.  However, I haven't given it another thought since I finished it.  Not a good sign for me.  But, maybe that's just me and you'll enjoy it more.  It is still worth buying, just not one of my favorites.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first heard they were doing a musical episode of 'Buffy' I wondered exactly what they'd been smoking.  The surprise was that, not only was it an excellent episode, very well done, but that the music was really pretty good as well.  When my wife brought home the soundtrack, I thought she had a screw loose.  However, after listening to it a couple of times, I found myself burning a copy to play in the car.  Several years later, I've gone in search of guitar tabs and find myself randomly singing selections from \\"Once More With Feeling\\".  Joss Whedon may very well be the oddest genius in Hollywood but I, for one, am glad he's making entertainment.  (Only with the possible exception of the theme song to \\"Firefly\\".)
0060825219|1.0|This last novel from Coelho actually deserves no star at all.  <br />The books that came before this one, are all stellar novels, to the extent of being instant classics - genious at times.  <br /> <br />This one, however, is nothing but what the title says; a spiritual rape of the reader.  <br /> <br />Coelho claims many things in this book - amongst them, that he has found the meaning of life, the universe and everything. Which we all know to be 42... and Coelho's explanation makes just as much sense as Adams'.  <br /> <br />High-flying, lacking a storyline - and a plot, self-righteous and bragging besserwisser-ness pollute this book like a leak from a broken sewer-pipe, killing whatever joy I had for this writer and his books from the outset. <br /> <br />The bottom line is, that it's not the worst book I've read, but it's bad, and it's definately the most disappointing book I've ever read. <br />
B0001I55NS|3.0|After reading the overwhelmingly negative critic reviews for \\"Timeline\\", I didn't want to go, but I got talked into it. And guess what? It was really stupid. But I have to admit I kinda liked it.<br /><br />Based on the book by Michael Crichton (from which significant details have been changed), \\"Timeline\\" stars Paul Walker, the poor-man's Keanu, as the son of Professor Johnston, a devoted archeologist who is working on a dig in France. Johnston has been receiving advice from a tech company based in New Mexico, who mysteriously seem to know just where to dig for all sorts of interesting finds. The professor gets suspicious, hops on a plane to New Mexico, and disappears. His son and some of the archeologists pay the tech company a visit, and are shocked to find that the Professor has gone back in time to the 14th century, and somehow managed to get himself lost in medieval France. They follow, and our story takes off.<br /><br />THE BAD: Okay, bad news first. Two words: Paul Walker. Oh man. His \\"acting\\" is beyond bad. When you consider the staggering amount of people who struggle in Hollywood, how does this maroon have a career? His performance is a giant void which sucks in all around him, including the normally good Frances O'Connor, who's terrible here. On the plus side though, if you get the DVD and watch the behind the scenes doc you'll see Walker behave like a complete jerk, on camera, when the cast pulls a practical joke on him. Heh heh.<br /><br />THE NOT-SO-BAD: Director Richard Donner (of Die Hard fame) is to be honestly commended for keeping it real, literally. Special effects are used sparingly; when we see thousand of flaming arrows hurtling threw the air in a battle scene, they are REAL arrows, not CGI. Ditto for fireballs and castles and all sorts of medieval coolness. The story itself is a bit tighter than a lot of Hollywood sci-fi, and the technology fairly feasible.<br /><br />THE ACTUALLY GOOD: Characters are usually a moot point in this type of film, but the wonderful romance between Marek (played by uber-hottie Gerard Butler) and Lady Claire (Anna Friel) is riveting. Watch her eyes when he insists on going back for his friends. Such a sweet, old-fashioned romance is rare in movies these days. Butler especially is one to watch, and along with his performance in the otherwise dreadful \\"Tomb Raider 2\\" proves he has the ability to be mesmerizing even when spouting the most ridiculous lines imaginable.<br /><br />AND IN CONCLUSION: Even though this is an action movie, \\"Timeline\\" has a decent amount of nuance and subtlety (largely due to Butler and Friel), even when fireballs are raining from the heavens. Fairly entertaining and occasionally exciting, it's worth the price of a rental. You can always laugh at it.<br /><br />GRADE: B-pe of film, but the wonderful romance between Marek (played by uber-hottie Gerard Butler) and Lady Claire (Anna Friel) is riveting.

B000AQBA1W|4.0|Beautiful instrumentals are showcased on this record of some traditional covers by the band. Vocal harmonies are good too as always.  I would have liked the bonus track from the Japanese version rather than new versions of \\"Old Town\\" and \\"Haste to the Wedding.\\"  Beautiful, thoughtful music.
B00004RF97|5.0|I am a big Katharine Hepburn fan. The actor I most watched happened to be Cary Grant. I also saw quite a number of George Cukor films(Dinner at Eight, David Copperfield, Little Women). And this is the best film made by any of them. It was not just Miss Hepburn, but the concerted effort of the whole cast and crew that made this B&W classic so dazzling.     The whole play is closely knitted and fast paced  (sometimes the dialogues were so fast that it took a second time to watch the movie before I could truly appreciate the story). From the two reporters (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey) to the whole Tracy's family (younger sister Dina, father and mother, Uncle Willie), their performances were most credible and delightful. Even though the whole play revolved around Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn), each of the remaining cast was given an intriguing personality. Dina (Virginia Weidler) was the smart and critical teenager who balleted, singed and played the piano - an act of mockery for the inquisitive reporters. Liz (Ruth Hussey) was the photography reporter who chose not to disclose his love of Mike (James Stewart). Both reporters were honourable and would not blackmail the Lord's family for an exclusive coverage of Tracy's marriage. I remembered when I first watched it on a 20\\" TV, I was already captured by the grand mansion the Lord's family lived in and the atmosphere of the high class the film successfully created around the Lord's family. Miss Hepburn also put on 5 elegant sets of costumes within the first 15 minutes!    It is also interesting to note that though \\"High Society\\" , a remake of Philadelphia Story made 16 years later, was very successful with the unforgettable song \\"True Love\\" sung by Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly on the movie, Philadelphia Story still stood the test of the time and remained a classic unsurpassed.    As for Miss Hepburn, Philadelphia Story was her vehicle and she deservedly re-established her fame and success through her unparalleled portrayal of Miss Tracy Lord. Katharine Hepburn was Tracy Lord - a role specially created for her on Broadway and she subsequently owned the movie rights, with the role of Dextor (Joseph Cotton on Broadway version) assumed by Cary Grant. Whether you are a fan of Katharine Hepburn, this is a classic of a classic you should not miss!
B000000HU1|5.0|Pothead Pixies?  Space whispers?  Zero the Hero?  Musicians giving themselves nicknames like Bambaloni Yoni and Dingo Virgin?  For a long, long time I had trouble thinking of Gong as serious progressive rockers for those reasons and more.  Having foolhardedly dismissed these guys as a young proghead, I was fortunate to rediscover them back when Ozric Tentacles were starting to make a name for themselves.  You could barely find an article about the Ozrics without a mention of Gong and this album in particular, and I really dug the Ozrics so I picked up some Gong CD's and this one has become one of my very favorite CD's over the years.<br /><br />Daevid Allen had lost none of the offbeat, whimsical humour he had brought to the early Soft Machine, and while by this point in Gong's history he had become more of a ringmaster, and would soon leave the band, it is his crazy sci-fi/stoner storyline that provides the framework for this record.  The whole Radio Gnome Trilogy concept may sound silly on paper, but it keeps these records together and gives them their uniqueness.  Without the story, this would be an excellent album of space/prog/fusion jams but with the storyline it becomes something more special, more lasting.  You was the third and final entry in the Radio Gnome series, but newcomers please trust me on this-you do NOT need to listen to the first two to \\"get\\" this one, and in fact I would easily recommend You as an entry point to any new listener.  This one stands on it's own just fine and serves as an excellent introduction to Gong.<br /><br />Guitarist Steve Hillage and woodwind master Didier Mahlerbe were the two featured soloists in this edition of Gong, playing over the monster rhythm section of Mike Howlett and Pierre Moerlen.  Synth player Tim Blake approached his instrument like no one before, treating the synthesizer not as a keyboard but as a means to \\"colour in\\" the music with a stunning array of bubbles, swooshes, fizzles and washes.  It is here that the greatest influence on Ozric Tentacles can be heard.  Gong were completely one-of-a-kind for many reasons, not least of which is Blake's contribution.<br /><br />The record opens with two very short psychedelic \\"pop\\" tunes that set things up for the fireworks to come.  Things really get going with \\"Magick Mother Invocation,\\" an extended intro to the awesome \\"Master Builder.\\"  The buildup to this track is simply incredible, and in no time at all you'll be chanting along with Gilli Smyth's space whisper invocation and starting to realize that far from being dopey, all this cosmic hippy nonsense actually does start to make sense, and sounds terrific too!<br /><br />From here, Gong blasts off into mostly instrumental space prog jams of the highest order on \\"A Sprinkling of Clouds\\" and \\"Isle of Everywhere,\\" while Allen and Smyth return once and again to perpetuate the story (such as it is.)  Hillage and Mahlerbe turn in some killer performances while the rhythm section grooves away and Blake blankets everything with his creative sounds and atmospherics.  \\"You Never Blow Your Trip Forever\\" wraps up the album and the trilogy with an epic slab of everything that made Gong great wrapped up into one song.  The perfect ending to a perfect album (and a Perfect Mystery!)that the greatest influence on Ozric Tentacles can be heard.

1573223026|4.0|Another great piece of literature from Nick Hornby. Laugh-out-loud humor with plenty of plot twists and a heart warming ending. It is truly hard to find an author as good as Hornby, one who brings me back with every new novel. This book is just as great as any of his previous, but this time with four main characters in switching roles. Each character in this book is hillarious; The shunned former TV star, the troubled teenage girl, the washed up rock musician, and the mother of a retarded child. All four of this crazy suicide support gang found their way into my heart as i read chapter after chapter of Hornby's latest masterpiece. Nick Hornby is a modern day Jane Austen, packing crazy love tangles and humorous results into every page.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Ok so I've been watching Veronica Mars since The Pilot and have been a big fan for a long time so when I herd that the DVD was available(I actually got it before the season finished because of my dad) a week after the finale in Canada suprisingly enough, I was thrilled.

A definate must have for the holiday season.  <br />

B000B63IEI|5.0|After Andsnes' superb Grieg Concerto, also with the BPO (under Jansons rather than Pappano) I was anxious to hear this new recording, and was glad I did - it's excellent.<br /><br />This CD comes into competition with Krystian Zimerman's recording of the same two concertos with Ozawa, released by DG last year. That version of the First was also extremely fine, but with a rather different interpretation. Zimerman's was fiery and intense (he explained in interviews at the time that these were youthful works and needed to explode - `you don't play the Rachmaninov concertos, you live them', I seem to recall). His playing was high voltage throughout whereas Andsnes, with no lack of fire, takes a more patrician approach which give just as fine rewards. Pappano gives superb support as well, this is very much a successful symbiosis, with the BPO playing like the great orchestra we know they are. This ranks alongside the greatest Firsts: the composer himself, Janis and Pletnev as well as Zimerman.<br /><br />Also the DG recording was sharp-edged and intense, whereas this EMI disc is slightly mellower with the piano and orchestra wonderfully blended. I do prefer the piano sound here as well: it's rich and sounds beautiful, but is ideally focused as well. Some found the Zimerman `sound', coupled with his high octane pianism (electrifying though it is) tiring on the ear after a while.<br /><br />Zimerman has often said that recording the sound of his playing is problematic; he hasn't made a solo recording for 10 years for this exact reason - which is perhaps one reason why sonic deficiencies all but wrecked his version of the Second, where the solo instrument is much too closely observed, giving a clattery feel to the performance, with every note audible.<br /><br />No such problems here: recorded live in the Berlin Philharmonie, Andsnes' version of the Second is very enjoyable, full of wonderful touches from soloist, conductor and orchestra: the exciting climax and coda of the first movement are finely handled, while in the slow movement, slightly more flowing than normal, the collaboration between Andsnes and orchestral soloists (particularly the flute, presumably BPO Principal Emanuel Pahud, given fine presence) is gorgeous.<br /><br />In the Finale's lovely second subject Pappano manages to impart some idiomatic Slavonic melancholy, if not quite as much as Ashkenazy when conducting for Helene Grimaud in her excellent version, which alongside this new Andsnes version is my favourite in digital sound. Also hear the brooding lower strings in the build up to the finale's climax which, as with Andsnes' Grieg, is played at full throttle but strictly `a tempo', with no playing to the gallery. Even so, they don't surpass Grimaud and Ashkenazy in sweep and power here. There is about 15 seconds of applause, not separately tracked.<br /><br />If you've got Richter's classic account on DG, Grimaud on Teldec, and Andsnes in the Second, I think you've got all bases covered.coda of the first movement are finely handled, while in the slow movement, slightly more flowing than normal, the collaboration between Andsnes and orchestral soloists (particularly the flute, presumably BPO Principal Emanuel Pahud, given fine presence) is gorgeous.  <br /> <br />In the Finale's lovely second subject Pappano manages to impart some idiomatic Slavonic melancholy, if not quite as much as Ashkenazy when conducting for Helene Grimaud in her excellent version, which alongside this new Andsnes version is my favourite in digital sound.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|There is so much I can say about Miss Keys...This woman is extremely talented. I was able to attend the taping of the Unplugged in NY and I witnessed history and by listening to the cd, I could relive every moment. This is truly an amazing cd, by an amazing artist. All lovers of music should have this CD in their collection. After listening to this CD, people who doubted her will be proven wrong..Alicia is the real thing.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|DAMN THIS CD IS FIYAHHH!!! I didnt get to attend the Unplugged taping in Brooklyn, NY...but this cd makes you feel as if you were there! Alicia's voice is so incredible! My favorite song most def has to be \\"Stolen Moments\\". That song was taken from her Tears For Water book. She also flips up some songs.....this is def a must see! I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of ALICIA KEYS!  <br />one luv <br />GABBY RENEE
B00002ND77|5.0|Malcolm X cannot truthfully be said to be one of Spike Lee's best films, but it was an important step for him, perhaps the most important one of his career. This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else. <br /> <br />So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before - it does, after all, span 200 minutes - and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice. In a biopic, and for that matter, in any docu-drama, the most important factor is for the director to care about the subject, and I'm yet to see a director who's more passionate about his subject than Mr. Lee. <br /> <br />Malcolm X boasts a huge ensemble casts, with wonderful performances by Delroy Lindo, Angela Bassette, Al Freeman Jr. (in a harrowing performance as Muslim extremist Elijah Muhammad) and Spike Lee himself - but the movie is still entirely Malcolm X's, and therefore Denzel Washington's. Spike's protg gave a lifetime performancein Mo' Better Blues two years earlier, but he surpassed it with his gut-wrenching portrayal of Malcolm X, which earned him an Oscar nomination (unfortunately lost to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman) and based him as one of the best actors of his generation. <br /> <br />Although Malcolm X is not Spike Lee's best film, it's an important film that needed to be made, and it's a good thing that Spike was the one to do it. More than it's an impressive, moving, beautiful movie - and it is - Malcolm X's story is a story that must be heard, and this biopic is a film that, truly, every cultured and intelligent person needs to watch.

B00005JKG5|3.0|I saw this movie for the first time last night. In 1983 OI had just graduated from high school and somehow missed it. I do however remember owning the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />I must say that the movie stands up pretty well despite its age. It could be that the story of follwing one's dreams is timeless. It also doesn't hurt that the movie starred the beautiful Jennifer Beals who unfortunately hasn't been seen again in ages. <br /> <br />The story of welder by day and dancer by night is well known. One could say that it became a cultural phenomenon in the eighties. Looking back the movie brings to mind some good memories and some memorable music(Who could forget the theme song by one hit wonder Irene Cara). <br /> <br />This film is not by any means something that is indespensible to your film collection but serves its place as a sort of sweet reminder of a what seems too distant past. <br /> <br />One should note that this film launched several Hollywood careers.Its director, writer, and producers have gone on to become icons of the industry.  <br /> <br />The DVD offers a decent enough transfer but falls short in that it has no special features.
B0000024ZT|5.0|This is my favorite!  The songs, the lyrics, the rhymes, the feelings, the laughter and the interesting observations.  Whatever covers were made (of any of these songs) are not as good as the originals by Bruce.  \\"For You\\" still gives me shivers whenever I hear it.  \\"Lost in the Flood\\" is great - what a story!  Every single song on here is fabulous.  1973 - what a year for the Boss!
B00007E8V4|4.0|Considering it took four years to make \\"Toxicity,\\" it's not (or shouldn't be) surprising that System of a Down had some leftover songs that they wanted heard. What is surprising, however, is that these b-sides were so good. Some songs here, like \\"Innervision\\" and \\"Chic `N' Stew,\\" are as good as anything on System's last two discs. In fact, the band left some of these songs off of their last album not because they weren't good songs, but because they wanted \\"Toxicity\\" to have a different, more serious theme. A song like \\"Bubbles\\" wouldn't exactly fit if it were next to, say, \\"Aerials.\\"<br /><br />These 13 songs don't have as many powerful lyrics as \\"Toxicity,\\" so \\"Steal This Album\\" doesn't have the sharp impact or depth that its predecessor had. But this C.D. is still very fun to listen to! Daron's riffs are still crunchy and heavy, sometimes (as in track three) almost flattening, and Serj's vocals are (as always) top-notch. (\\"Roulette\\" is probably the best example of his proper, nasal, almost soulful singing.) Plus, even though they're not AS good, the lyrics are still pretty intelligent. \\"Boom\\" is a bold, unabashed anti-war tirade, and has lyrics like \\"four thousand children die per hour from starvation/while billions spent on bombs/creating death showers.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Pictures\\" is a fairly odd song with catchy drumming, making it kind of sound like it's a b-side from System's first, self-entitled album. Next, \\"Highway Song\\" has a good soft-loud-soft dynamic, as well has a good give and take between the guitars and drums. \\"Ego Brain\\" seems in the same mold as \\"Toxicity\\"'s album closer, \\"Aerials,\\" and \\"Roulette\\" features acoustic guitar plucking and even some violins. Other highlights include \\"Mr. Jack,\\" \\"I-E-A-I-A-I-O,\\" and the silly \\"F**k The System.\\"<br /><br />When it was first released, \\"Steal This Album\\" served as a nice snack to whet fans appetites for what was to come. Now, since \\"Mezmerize\\" was released earlier this year (2005), \\"Steal This Album\\" isn't any less good, it's just the band's best album, and not essential for casual System of a Down fans. But if you liked SoaD's first two albums, you're sure to like this, as well.d, it's just the band's best album, and not essential for casual System of a Down fans.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|I have only listened to Welcome to Jamrock so far. <br /> <br />WELCOME TO JAMROCK  - Damian Marley <br /> <br />encapsulates the history <br />pulsates with vivid imagery <br /> <br />expresses the cold blooded violence <br />through use of dialectic utterances <br /> <br />epitome of true 'dancehall stylee' <br />emanating the sound of Barrington Levy <br /> <br /> <br />From the first time I heard it on 95.7 FM The Beat, Tampa Bay, FL, I knew that I had to purchase the music and learn the lyrics. <br /> <br />This is the most Jamaican sounding music I've heard in a long time. It is profoundly powerful in its delivery. The sound of it is reminiscent of the style of reggae rap, which originated in the late 70's and proliferated in the eighties. In terms of art, this cut is the peak of what Jamaican reggae rap is. It is a poetic reflection of the reality of living in Jamaica. This piece is wonderfully arranged.   <br /> <br />It explores politics, gang violence, and a drug atmosphere, which a tourist wouldn't understand. Damian's father, Bob Marley, was a victim of the gang warfare. He was shot while performing at a concert for peace. The lyrics are true to the experiences of ghetto life in Kingston. <br /> <br />
038073186X|3.0|The bad news first: the central mystery/revelation here is a) unoriginal, to put it kindly  (Beautiful Mind, Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Memento, or that one with John Cusack at the motel, to name a few), and b) betrayed by clues of about a 5th-grade level of complexity (well, at least no one was running around yelling \\"REDRUM! REDRUM!\\"), so if you're paying the least bit of attention you'll figure it out about halfway through at the latest.<br /><br />I really wish Lehane had come up with a better way to get this story and his themes across, because, despite its huge flaws, this book is still unsettling and extremely sad.  The last couple of chapters (after the big nonsurprise is gotten out of the way) are very moving and dark, no mean feat when you consider the cheesiness of much of what comes before (I half expected Bugs Meany to pop up as an orderly and say he remembered he took the patient back to the cell at dusk because he saw the sun setting through an eastern-facing window.  But I digress.)<br /><br />It's a shame his editor didn't send Lehane back to the drawing board to take another crack (or two) at this, because there is a lot to like here (Lehane absolutely nails the dream sequences).  Of course, if that had happened we might have ended up with a great book but a plot that would fetch a lot less in film rights.  And THAT would be criminally insane.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|Alicia is a real artist, a beautiful person, with such amazing and strong voice. Since the day one I knew shes gonna do something new, something different in the world of music, and I was right. When you hear her voice, its all clear. She`s so great. And all of her songs are just amazing, we can see she`s doing it with a passion and her heart and soul. And I haven`t seen so much artist like her, doing it their own thing. I love this Unplugged cd and dvd. AMAZING! She really put everything in this project, like in all her things. Just amazing, great voice, great audience, great music, and i love it. I think every1 should have this cd and of course the dvd, becasue its so wonderful to see Alicia playing on the piano and singing like an angel, cracking jokes.... She`s a true artist and she`ll be doing this for a long time...

078681859X|4.0|A tale introducing two radically different and contrary main characters, Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimeus the powerful and clever djinni. The book focuses on their strained relaltionship and differs from the Harry Potter books in its portrayal of magic as the conjuring and subsequent binding of mischievous spirits, rather than spellslinging and waving of wands. \\"Cthuluesque\\" could be a good description of the Bartimeus-magic, when the mythology-part is slightly subratracted from the lot. The idea of a Britain run by a stuck-up class of magicians, takes some time to get used to, but eventually works. The language is fluent and does not strand with any particular age-category. Recommended.
6304106017|5.0|Somewhere in Texas, bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his brother Ritchie are in a tight spot. They've got two gorgeous hostages at gunpoint (who were those angels anyway, and why were their roles so small?), and are anxiously waiting for the local lawman to make his way out of the roadside liquor store they're hiding in. Things don't move fast enough for psychopath Ritchie (Quentin Tarantino) when the cop asks to use the restroom, so bullets start flying. Let the bloodbath begin! From here on out, it's carnage candy, Tarantino/Rodriguez style!<br /><br />Seth and Ritchie, who is now shot through the hand, head south for the Mexican border with a ton of dirty money and a slightly less attractive hostage in their trunk (why they let those other two go and kept this one I'll never understand). They eventually stop at a cruddy little motel to eat and plan their next move. Seth foolishly leaves the hostage with his maniacal brother as he goes out for burgers. When he returns, he finds her a victim of rape and murder; brother Ritchie acting like the innocent victim. These guys have problems.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the completely innocent Fuller family, former Minister Jacob and his two teenage children Scott and Kate, have found themselves at the same motel. Seth eyes their motor home and decides it's exactly the transportation he and his brother need to get them across the border with their money, and to the nudie bar where they plan to meet their shady business associates in the morning. Before we know it, the Fuller family is taken hostage, and the whole gang is on the road down Mexico way. After a brief search by a perverted Border Patrol Agent, our little group of adventurers is given the okay to cross, and soon enough they find themselves at the most boisterous gentlemen's club on either side of the border. Once inside, the gang is treated to a show like most of them have never seen before, featuring Salma Hayek as the main attraction. But when Ritchie gets himself into a scuffle and his bloody hand starts flowing red again, the mood of the hosts begins to change, drastically. As it turns out, the ancient Mexican nudie bar is run entirely by vampires! Soon, our anti-hero Seth is leading his hostages and a couple of new friends on a fight to save their lives, at least until dawn!<br /><br />From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what you'd expect from a Tarantino/Rodriguez vampire collaboration! And, like all the Tarantino films I've seen so far, every second of it is totally captivating. You don't want to miss a moment! Yes, it's violent to the extreme, but you should be expecting that. There's more than that, though. You get a Tarantino style tale of redemption, survival, and triumph of the human spirit over the most evil of adversaries. The entire cast is first rate, including Tom Savini's best work as \\"Sex Machine,\\" the outlaw biker, reminiscent of the character he played in the original Dawn of the Dead. This film is part \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" part \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" and part \\"Vamp,\\" all rolled into one kickbutt ball of pure adrenaline. With the awesome make-up and creature effects and the excellent soundtrack, it's easily among the best Vampire movies ever made. And, for me, the real payoff is that pull-away shot in the end, when we get the FULL view of the Mexican nudie-bar. Definitely one to watch over and over again. I also can recommend \\"From Dusk Till Dawn 3,\\" a pretty decent direct to video prequel that tells the tale of how Salma Hayek's character came to be the leader of this very ancient clan of bloodsuckers. From \\"Dusk Till Dawn 2\\" wasn't all that great on the other hand, but hey, it's not unwatchable, and ya gotta have the whole set. Oh, one more thing!

0027164403|5.0|Dear Zoo was a favorite first book for both of my boys.  They both learned to anticipate and lift the flaps by the age of 14 months.  My two boys couldn't be any different so this book must be a classic if they both love it so much!  And the best part is that my 3 1/2 year old now reads it to his little brother all by himself.  They love it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Let me preface this by admitting...I don't really watch TV. I enjoy movies, I enjoy movie theatres, but I don't watch \\"TV\\". It wasn't always like this. I used to swear by Sliders, dream of the X-Files,  I even watched Seaquest with devotion.  <br /> <br />The sad thing was that I grew up. Most \\"TV\\" is hollow and consists of low-risk, high-reward reuse of the same tired concepts again and again (ex., Reality Shows). <br /> <br />Enter Firefly. When was the last time you could watch characters on a TV show that you actually cared about. When was the last time you could watch a show and not care if it revealed one of the \\"mysteries\\" that seem to be the lone driving force behind all dramas today. I watched Firefly just because I loved the world, I loved the people in the world, and I wanted to be a part of it everyday (not literally of course).  <br /> <br />It was cancelled.  <br /> <br />If you didn't watch the show when it was on TV, buy it now and see what TV could and should be. You'll also be doing your part to insure it makes it's triumphant and well-deserved return someday.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Please understand, I'm giving this 3 stars because of the possibilities of what is out there, it is still a high quality release.<br /><br />Sorry folks, but \\"The Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" is a better film of a better concert for a MUCH better album. And, while I would be hard pressed to use the word \\"sucks\\" with Floyd, comparing the version of \\"One Of These Days\\" on this to the magnificent version on \\"Thunder\\".... well...all I can say is I can't even listen to any other version and if you haven't heard \\"Thunder\\" you just don't understand!<br /><br />Being a huge Floyd fan, I did buy this the day it came out but am still hoping for a DVD release of Thunder. I have a PAL import of Thunder but would still pay $$ for a domestic version. I perfectly understand Gilmour's concern about the quality, considering his obsessiveness. The company that released the PAL version also released a DVD of his Solo 1984 \\"About Face\\" show (YES!!! Floyd fans should seek it out by all means!!) and both are kinda grainy compared to modern DVDs. But come on David...Floyd fans trade mono VHS bootlegs for gosh sakes, they'll forgive you for lack of perfection!!<br /><br />And I won't even go in to other shows that could be released other than the following. Where is \\"The Wall\\" live (parts of which were shown on VH-1's \\"Behind the Wall) or something from the \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" era. And there was a professional film crew at the \\"Animals\\" concert I attended as a Teenager so I know that's out there too!<br />Bottom line...I own it but when there's so much superior material out there, why this?
B000AA305M|4.0|When David Gray takes 3 years of to record a new album, you know he's putting a piece of himself into the music.  Gray mentioned his last album \\"A New Day at Midnight\\" felt rushed and a bit unpredictable.  Here, Gray has taken his time and used his resources to the fullest.  The sound is big, produced and often times too dramatic for Gray's dynamic Welsh accent to benefit.  But altogether the quiet and reserved Gray breaks through on tracks like \\"Aint No Love\\" where his voice dominates the clear and resonant meaning of a simple chorus backed by a quiet piano and weeping strings.   <br /> <br />The lyrics are nothing out of the ordinary.  Gray clearly told the world he could write on his debut album \\"Flesh\\" and he does not deviate often from his original prose.  Many of the songs are a bit more repetive such as \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" where we find him repeating the same line three or four times.  But the point is much more poetic and the result is a big finish to a very new beginning for David Gray.  Fans of the \\"White Ladder\\" era will inevitably fall for the single \\"The One I Love,\\" but who wouldn't?   <br /> <br />Gray hits strides with the upbeat \\"Hospital Food\\" and \\"Nos da Cariad\\" where we find him on new ground with droning guitars and a flooring rhythm section.  It is somewhere we have never seen him before ,and it is a rewarding place to find Gray merging his early acoustic records with the new pace he found in \\"White Ladder.\\" <br /> <br />Overall, the experience on Gray's album is a somber, but meaniful joyride.  You can't help but find meaning behind the songs here.  There is no slow piece in the set, though a metronome may tell you differently.  David Gray is painting a story here.  And it is a dynamic one of many pieces.

B000B0QOJA|5.0|John Coltrane is one of the greatest musicians of all time, and the fact that even just four new songs have been brought into the world in this high quality is worth the long wait.  I have always enjoyed Coltrane's playing, ranging from his Dizzy Gillespie days to his final releases, but his famous quartet is his most cohesive unit.  Jimmy Garrison, McCoy Tyner, and Elvin Jones provide the foundation for Coltrane's most remarkable performances, and these two radio performances are no exception.  While the mixing is done incredibly well, there are some annoying hiccups that had to be incured in the mixing process in order to provide smooth playback.  Despite this, the recording is one of Coltrane's most impressive live recordings, which is impressive to say the least.  \\"One Up, One Down\\" is an incredible track as Elvin Jones and John Coltrane really synchronize during their duet.  Not a good introduction to Coltrane, but for the appreciators, this is an must.
B0002OERI0|4.0|So many reviewers here state that this record sucks because it's not punk. Well, duh. I have a brilliant observation: it's not polka either. How about if we take this for what it is: good, fun pop music with a healthy dose of left-wing politics. It is a damn fine record.<br /><br />PS it's not New Age Country Waltz music either. In case you were wondering.
B00005OM5L|5.0|Clapton is still at his peak. Playing as good and even better than he did back in the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />I bought this DVD, Clapton's Guitar Festival DVD and the Cream 2005 Reunion DVD all within the last couple months. All of them are just great, but I'd give the Cream Reunion DVD a solid 5 in all categories...to me its even better than this DVD.<br /><br />However back to Clapton's Live in Hyde Park, the footage is great, the sound is great, the band is solid, and Eric really plays with fire on most tracks. He's definetely one of the most reserved/modest guitar players, but truly shines above all others when it comes down to who has the real substance to stand above his peers.
B00004W510|5.0|I was looking for something else but ended up at this album by The Band.  The first reviewer pretty much covered it.  This is my favorite album of all time, too.  I bought it when it came out, at a Sears of all places but this was before the megastores.  There is just nothing missing from it, and it was timeless then and remains that way today.  It was almost spooky how they had tapped into something so close to the soul of America and with love, pride, and faith. I swore I'd not fall behind as music evolved but there is just something about what is happening in music when young that is a natural connection.  Rock and Roll got to the point it started to repeat itself and it's cool, but been there, you know.  Something like this album simply transends any pretense and I hope people hearing it today make the same connection with the music and get that crazy feeling they have been there before.  Best heard as a vinyl 33rpm record on any player at hand, it is in it's natural form.   <br /> <br />There is so much great music in the world I am rather astonished I can name one album as my favorite.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I was fortunate enough to get tickets for the event in london when my girlfriend won the 2 tickets in the text lottery. From the opening song performed by U2 and Paul McCartney to the closing Hey Jude performence, it was class. The show ran over by nearly 2 hours so it had everything you could want from a gig. The best singers, songwriters and bands put on one hell of a show. This DVD set is highly recommended. I cant wait for it myself. I was close to the front so this DVD release will bring back great memories.
0688170528|2.0|This is the second novel I have read by this author and I have come to the conclusion that she has a problem with endings.  She starts out great and the stories are interesting and she is taking on tough issues but then she wimps out.  The first one of hers I read was My Sister's Keeper.  Like this one, I picked it up because the synopsis sounded intriguing and like this one I was disappointed because she doesn't handle the very issue she's writing about.  In The Pact even she admits (in an interview) she let Chris off and the ending wasn't right.  Then why write it?  Her endings are emotional cheats.

There's the solo-singer songwriter-Bob Dylan-folky sounding \\"Heartbreaker\\", his most classic rock / alt country album \\"Gold\\", the 80's rock alt inspired \\"Rock and Roll\\" and the almost British sounding \\"Love is Hell\\", need I go on......  He continues to mimic new influences in \\"Cold Roses.\\"  Upon listening I wanted to immediately dislike this album.  After listening time and time again I began to enjoy this collection getting past the initial shock.  There are some knockout songs on this disc which no doubt is most definitely inspired by the Dead.  To prove it, \\"Rosebud\\", a song on the second disc is a song about J. Garcia's guitar.  \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", the opening song, is by far the most \\"Dead\\" influenced song on the album and jams on for a little too long.  However, he strays from this GD theme and delivers tunes that sound more of the RA we all know.  My favorites include the likes of \\"Friends\\", \\"Sweet Illusions\\", and \\"When will you come back home\\", all of which I could listen to repeatedly.  This album is killer and totally proves that Ryan Adams is the most versatile and well rounded musician in today's society.  People may state that this album is a \\"Grateful Dead\\" rip off, but I believe they are too quickly dismissing this amazing effort.  He is totally capable of switching genres and styles and does it with so much ease it is truly remarkable.  I hope the critics can look past the initial shock as I have and take this album for what it truly is, a collection of great songs backed by a great band.  Way to go Ryan!!  I can't give 5 stars but I would give 4.5 if possible.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I LOVE this CD!  Ray Charles IS a Genius.... <br />the duets are amazing.  My favorite by far is Sweet Potato Pie the with James Taylor.  Although...the duet with Nora Jones, is a VERY close second. ALL of the artist's that performed are wonderful...and I highly recommend this CD to everyone!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This television series got lost somehow among potential viewers as it was short lived. Maybe the gratification factor wasn't quick enough to grab a large viewership. Maybe it was poorly or under promoted. Maybe the television executives long ago traded in their sense of pride in craftsmanship for the almighty buck. Nevertheless, the writing and directing produced a synergy of characters and storytelling unlike anything I've seen on television since Twin Peaks and Babylon 5, not that there are any parallels to be made. Firefly enveloped you with every second of storytelling. In Firefly, character development and synergy are unmatched, and I couldn't help but feel like the crew should be in my own family; when the series ended I felt left behind. The new movie, Serenity, will, I hope, revive the television series, or at least spawn a series of cinematic sequels, that will hopefully fill the coffers of the moguls to keep it going but will unquestionably satisfy the fans.
630471193X|5.0|PHENOMENON could have been one of those syrupy, maudlin-filled stories we've been handed, but thanks to an intelligent script, astute direction by Jon Turteltaub and a stunning cast, this movie is poignant, touching and an affirmative nod to the human spirit.  John Travolta in one of his best performances plays George, an auto mechanic who one night \\"sees a bright light\\", is stunned by it and wakes up changed.  He is now obsessed with knowledge, of learning, and he's a little telekinetic to boot.  How this affects him and the people in his small town overrides the obligatory governmental intervention subplot.  Travolta is marvelous and so is the rest of the cast: Kyra Sedgwick as the relation-phobic young mother who is the object of Travolta's affections; Robert Duvall is superb as the doctor/friend who tries to get Travolta through this change; Forest Whitaker as his farmer buddy.  In fact, the whole cast is right on target in support of this remarkable leading performance.  PHENOMENON is touching, and offers a look at how Travolta's friends find themselves both in awe and in fear of his newfound powers.
B0009XT8YW|4.0|Listening to Guilty I recalled how very nicethe Streisand and Gibb voices blended.  I enjoyed hearing this pairing once again in their new CD Guilty Pleasures.
B000002VCE|5.0|Unbelivable, I've also owned this in multiple formats and can't imagine not having it in my collection.  It's Southern, it's rock , it's perfect.
0060763280|5.0|The book is spiritually smart and holds secrets to earthly levels of mastery. I love the book and I'm not rich yet, but the mind-set is pretty much astablished. It takes a lot of personal will to pull it through though....You cannot just read the book, you REALLY gotta want to change your inner world, and de-associate yourself from past fears. I suggest NET ( neuro emotional technique ) as a additional tool for releasing our negative patterns, and also to constantly monitor your thought forms in other levels too, not just financally. The book is amazing, and none have said these triths better than T. Harv Eker. I recommend HIGHLY this book.
B000002KKK|5.0|It wasn't Eliminator that made these guys great.  This is the rubber meeting the road. Not many finer Rock/Blues exixt.  On many famous must have lists, this album has a place in history.
B000035Z3K|5.0|The orginal 1931 Dracula is 1 of the best films ever made. I'm really into the old time films. I must say the effects were very good for those times.
B000003NA4|4.0|Diana Krall's voice is very relaxing. When you listen to this CD, have a drink in your hand, sit back and just breathe. It's even better if you have someone you love to lean against on when you're listening to this. But either way, it's a great CD that I think any jazz or adult contemporary listener would love.
B0007YMUZW|4.0|Album crosses over quite a few genres. Not a country fan by any stretch of the imagination but this alt-country stuff is good. I have read numerous reviews about Ryan Adams concerts and concluded I am not a fan of him but love this album.  <br />
B000B0QOJA|1.0|Sorry, I should have known better.  Not my favorite Coltrane period but I thought what the hey.  Impulse usually delivers the goods.  This is god aweful.  The sound quality on the title track is just terrible with drop outs and distortion galore.  Yes I know when and where it was recorded and there will be some Trane-iacs that will just have to have these discs and that's fine.  I'm not one of them.  I do own just about every side Trane ever did including all the Riverside/Ojc discs, Blue Notes, Atlantic (the deluxe Atlantic packages are the ones to have here, the sound quality is several notches above the previous cd issues), & Impulse.  There is just too much good Trane out there to have to listen to this.  I am very disappointed.  As one music magazine back in the 70's used to say, \\"Savory, but for special tastes.\\"
B0009S3HI0|5.0|I first thought this album would suck completely.  I was prepared to just write it off.  Why won't they release their new album that is supposed to be incredible? Why would I want to own a collection of music videos and songs that could not make any of their albums? These questions and many more filled my brain along with anger. Well, I was wrong and will never doubt the tones ever again.  The acoustic songs were way better than I thought and The Skynyrd cover is very good.  I really liked this CD and the DVD.  It would be a great gift for a birthday or christmas.  As everybody says : It is a must own for the serious tones fan.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption is my personal favorite movie, and I think you'll find that it's also the personal favorite of many a film lover.    I wouldn't say there's an overriding reason for this, but in general I believe the main reason is because people generally choose a favorite movie or book because it relates to their lives in many ways. And I believe the story of The Shawshank Redemption is a story that many individuals can, in fact, relate to. It is for this reason, among other reasons of course, that the film has reached such a level of popularity with the movie-going public.    Certainly, most of us (I hope) will not go to prison for a crime we did not convict and face an evil warden and prison guards before our eventual redemption. But what we do face, though, are many of own \\"prisons\\" and our own hardships, and I truly believe that those who love this movie see the main character (Andy Dufresne) as a representation of themselves -- and how they would like their life to eventually end up despite having \\"impossible\\" obstacles of their own to face. As The Shawshank Redemption says, to come \\"out clean on the other side.\\"    Many of America's greatest films did not get their proper acclaim at the time of their release, and only as time went by did the public elevate them to their legendary status. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption, and in the future, I expect you'll find that The Shawshank Redemption is widely accepted as one of the greatest films ever made.    If you relate to the film's story and of Andy's experience in the movie, you'll almost certainly think the movie to be spectacular. Five stars. One of the best. If not, you'll probably find yourself thinking it to be a drawn-out prison movie. Three or four stars for a strong plot -- nothing spectacular. But, honestly, isn't that what's so great about movies? We all pick our favorites based on how they relate to our lives and our experiences. It just so happens that in the case of The Shawshank Redemption, the movie relates to a whole LOT of us.
B00005OAA6|5.0|i give vicotoria beckham mad props. this cd is actually pretty decent. i wasnt a spice girl fan, but my older sister was, and i always disliked them. but by far, i would have to say that posh was my favorite.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Like many others, no doubt, I first saw Citizen Kane in 1998 when it topped the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest movies. And being 18 when I first saw the movie (and being like many other young people), I thought Citizen Kane was overrated. I thought the movie was good -- certainly -- but great? Among the best ever? I just didn't see it. <br /> <br />Seven years down the road, however, I must admit that I've changed my mind. I just purchased Citizen Kane to add as an essential to my DVD collection, and having just watched the movie again, I must say that I now have a much greater appreciation of the classic film. <br /> <br />I still don't think it's the best movie ever, but I think it more than deserves to be in the top ten or top twenty. Certainly among the best. <br /> <br />All the discussion of film technique and groundbreaking cinematography aside, the STORY of Citizen Kane is a fantastic one; and to realize it parallels not only the life of William Randolph Hearst but of Orson Welles, as well, makes it even better. <br /> <br />In fact, if not for the supplemental Battle over Citizen Kane DVD included with this two-disk special edition, I would never have understood all the history surrounding the film. <br /> <br />All in all, I think Citizen Kane is one of the best movies ever made for two reasons. First and foremost, it's a brilliant tale of how a good man can destroy himself and crumble to nothingness (something from which anyone pursuing excellence in his/her life can learn). And, secondly, when Citizen Kane is placed in its historical context, it only helps to elevate an already great picture. From the story of its subject(s); to Welles' original battle just to get it shown in theaters; to its resurgence in the 50's; to its grandiose stature today; it's certainly a fascinating journey of how powerful art can't be held down. In the end, it will triumph and be recognized. <br /> <br />Mix those two reasons in with all the discussion of groundbreaking filmmaking, and you have one heck of a motion picture. <br /> <br />I highly recommend not only giving the movie a chance but watching the supplemental Battle over Citizen Kane DVD, as well. If after watching both the movie and supplemental DVD, you're not convinced Citizen Kane is deserving of its stature, I think that (at the very least) you'll understand why so many others think it is.
0375432302|5.0|The book was a real page turner. The first few chapters had me wondering about where the book was going. Be patient. It all comes together with a great ending. Aside from that, the book got me thinking about possibilities other than what organized religion would have us believe. And, it got me thinking about other related subjects that turned out to be quite interesting. Read the book, you'll see what I mean!
B000002OX7|5.0|Can someone please explain to me how a couple of idiots can use this space to ramble on and on about nonsense?  ALL of the negative reviews here appear to be by the same one or two people who obviously have nothing better to do than use this space to ramble on and on about I don't know what- it's hard to tell what they're saying with all the misspelled words.  Did they even listen to this CD?.  Hey Idiots- if you want to promote some other band, fine, go review that CD.  Hey amazon- please try a little harder to keep these idiots off of here. <br /> <br />On to this CD.  A classic.  All 9 of the original album songs are great.  The bonus songs are just that- a little something extra that are nice, but not as good as the first nine, except for Pure and easy, which should have been on the album, and the alternate version of Behind blue eyes, which should have been on the album instead.  If you don't have this- buy it today.  For $10 it's a bargain; the best I ever had!
B0000DCGT3|5.0|It was so funny, heartfilling, and I liked it better than the rest of the others American Pie & 2. It is one movie that you cannot keep from laughing from beginning to end thank you I enjoyed it.
0689865384|5.0|I got this book from my local library, and I had no idea what it was about.  It sounded interesting and I thought I'd give it a try.  This book was AMAZING.  The story is so original, and the way it mixed futuristic with the past was so cool.  I really enjoyed how they viewed our world - everything there is so advanced that they see what we did and what we have as insane.  This book allows you to realize that everybody looks good in their own right.  I personally hate my nose, but after reading this book I'm more \\"Ok, my nose is me.\\"  The length may deter some, but it's a fast read and very well written.  Now I just have to wait for my local library to get \\"Pretties\\" in so I can read that one. :)
B00005O3VC|5.0|I always have this disconcerting bafflement and not a little bit of annoyance whenever I teach my \\"Comedy Unit #1\\" to my sophomore English students.  I wrap my \\"Comedy Unit\\" in a cloak of pseudo-science so that I can watch funny stuff while being able to justify it to the administration (should they walk in when I am showing a clip from \\"Young Frankenstein\\").  I make the students write a definition essay at the end, \\"What is Comedy?\\" as part of our state curriculum requirements. Anyway........we study the various types of comedy: slapstick, parody,satire, scatological, etc.  Then as an example of a movie that incorporates almost every type of comedy, I show \\"Monty Python and the...\\"  I still find it hilarious and as I watch it over and over again, I am struck anew each time when I see how smart it is.  Here's my question:  I see each year that the smarter the kid the harder they laugh.  I don't mean to sound elitist but my honors classes hoot and holler.  My \\"general\\" students, who are proud of having read \\"a\\" book in middle school, sometimes laugh at the slapstick and then there are a significant number who mutter the whole time, \\"This is so stupid, why are we watching this? This is stupid....and so on.\\" I start to get fed up after the first two mutters because:   1) They could be deconstructing *War and Peace* if I was in a really bad mood and    2) I love this movie.  I warn them ahead of time that they might not \\"get\\" all of the satire (peasant/king political debate) but how can you resist a line about a moist bit throwing scimitars at you  or a watery tart etc.  This movie is very, very smart and very, very funny.  Anyway, I propose we throw out the traditional IQ test and show this to high schoolers to assess their intelligence or at least intellectual potential.    How can you not love this movie?  Someone please tell me how to respond to those unfortunates who \\"don't get it\\".
0156030306|5.0|This is truly one of my favorite books.  <br /> <br />In the beginning, it was funny. In the middle, it was terrifying. When the end came(and all too soon,) it was sad. <br /> <br />Not \\"oh no that guy was so happy and then his dog who was always with him and died\\" sad. It is sad in the fact that it is true. True fiction, that explores every aspect of a person as he goes from an IQ of 68 to be a genius, and back again. Every character is fully developed, every moment beautifully described; it remains ingrained in memory as though it happened to someone I know. As though I know- knew- Charlie, and Miss Kinnian, and even such characters as Frank and Joe.
0312330529|5.0|The people who gave this amazing book under 4 stars are criminally insane!!!! Seriously, I have never been more outraged reading a book review before! I am at a loss for words when I try to think of the sheer ignorance they have demonstrated in saying anything negative about Shantaram. I feel personally insulted! Really, what other modern ficition book is better than Shantaram? I have read it twice, the second time right after I finished the first read, because I couldn't bear to part with the characters and the city, Mumbai. I recommended it to my friends, family and co-workers and everyone LOVES the book and after reading it cannot find another book that matches its scope, characters and superb, if slightly over-the-top writing.... <br /> <br />Ok, I'll stop now because thinking about the idiots who didn't undersand the genius of this book is upsetting me...
B000A3DFZE|5.0|Sixty-year-old Eric Clapton is rocking a little harder again. He hardly rocked hard on 2001's REPTILE. This album features one track personally penned by Clapton. Another was written by his late friend,ex-Beatle George Harrison. Some songs Clapton wrote with Simon Climie who both collaborated on 1998's PILGRIM. One song has an unusual key change(it goes from C to D flat then B flat)*. In certain aspects,some songs are similar to those on REPTILE. Very good album,though. Hey,EC fans would be surprised to know(those who didn't) that Clapton reunited with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker for several concerts in May. The threesome is known as Cream,who had a string of hits between 1966 and 1969. Cream disbanded in 1969 due to the strain of all three members being major stars individually. The reunion concerts inspired the recording of an album and a DVD counterpart. *Those who read and understand music would immediately figure this out.
B000000Y2F|4.0|All compositions were written by Thelonious Monk. If you are at all familiar with Monk, you will not be disappointed. There is an easy familiarity to some of the songs, and that wonderful twisted oddness that is Thelonious Monk in some songs. John Coltrane plays on five of the six cuts with a trio or quartet. Track #6 is Monk solo on the piano. Although it is approx. 38 minutes, with only one cut in stereo, it is a good addition to the collections of those who want some more Monk or Coltrane.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It is awesome...great to have the whole show in one place :)
B00005YUPO|2.0|When I want to sit my toddler down to watch a DVD, I don't want to have to wait for silly Walt Disney DVD intros, or a plug by the founder for more stuff on the website.  It takes me a full minute to get the DVD going.  Please, let's just get to the material, I am very busy.  Overall this DVD is okay, but not stellar, just keeps my little guy entertained for a bit.  Much more prefer \\"Signing Time\\", which is much higher quality throughout, with no annoying intro filler.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|Firefly, like any show, has its ups and downs in season one. But what great Whedon-esque characters and stories! This is like a Western in space, with the the clever dialogue we've come to expect from Buffy the Vampire Slayer's creator.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|all the compositions on PLANS are water-tight ocean-going vessels.  PLANS should move these kids into arenas if they're not there already.
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Having never watched Enterprise before I started buying the DVDS, because I don't have UPN, I am only now watching these episode for the first time. I have to say that Enterprise Season Three is the best out of the three seasons released so far.<br /><br />It really has matured into Star Trek. There is action mixed with thoughtful plots. There is a revenge story the entire season and the pain of the crew's loss can be felt on almost every episode.<br /><br />The entire storyline is based on the tragic event of 9/11. Earth is minding it's own business and is attacked, killing seven million people on Earth. The storyline is so close to what happened in real life, you'll be on edge hoping Earth gets revenge for the slaughter of seven million innocent people.<br /><br />The Xindi themselves are an interesting new species of aliens that have never before been seen, but arguably have been mentioned in Trek before ENT. They make the Suliban seem weak.<br /><br />Overall, Enterprise Season 3 is the season to get if you are a fan of Trek or ENT alone, even non-fans would enjoy this. I've been a fan of Trek for years and I have to say that Season 3 is a must own even for those who didn't like the previous two seasons. This has to be in the top 5 seasons of all time for any Trek series. Get it, and you won't be disappointed

B0002S947K|5.0|First heard this artist on CBS Sunday Morning several months ago. The clip sounded GREAT so I purchased a copy of TROUBLE from AMAZON........WOW......what a great buy!  Every track is superb.  AMAZING voice.  Bet he goes BIG.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|This piece of excement of a \\"movie\\" comes straight out of the old Edgar Rice Burroughs school of racist propaganda cloaked as popular entertainment. The theme is the same - white man ventures into deep, dark, chaotic, lawless Africa, rescues the non-African maiden, physically dominates many African men, and miraculously emerges with nary a scratch at the end.     An utterly ridiculous fantasy, but one carefully calculated to send unmistakable messages to all viewers. It would no doubt surprise viewers that Mali is ruled by a democratically-elected President and government. There is no corrupt \\"general\\" as unflatteringly portrayed in this garbage production.    Here we are in 2005 and the old stereotypes about Africa are still being relentlessly propagated. One wonders why? If I could give this stinking heap of offal a zero or minus rating I would.
B00097DX3U|5.0|When I purchased AUDIOSLAVE's new release, my husband could not believe it.  He has lived long enough to come home and find me rocking out to them!  It definitely keeps me young!  Each track is a treat.
B000AL730O|1.0|First of all, I am a huge Paul McCartney fan.  I have loved almost everything he has done with The Beatles and beyond.  I also really like his recent work.  Flowers in the Dirt, Off the Ground, Flaming Pie, and Driving Rain were all decent albums, but Chaos and Creation is awful.  This album suffers from three problems.  First, all of the songs sound the same.  If it were not for the pause between songs, I could not tell where one song ends and the next begins.  Second, it suffers from dull, overly simplified, uncreative, clich ridden lyrics.  I can hardly believe this is Paul.  Cool lyrics were what made his music so good.  Finally, the music from the last song on this album sounds as if it was plagiarized from the song \\"People Get Ready,\\" with \\"People Get Ready\\" being the better song.  I am so disappointed with this CD, I want my money back.  The strongest tracks here are \\"Fine Line\\" and \\"Jenny Wren,\\" but this CD is still not worth buying.  Anything Paul did in the seventies is way better than this. <br /> <br />Everyone is comparing this CD to Paul's first solo album McCartney, this CD is nothing like McCartney.  That album was cool, this one is filled from start to finish with corny \\"Barney the Dinosaurish, I love you, you love me\\" songs.  Paul wanted to fill the world with silly love songs, and his prior work has done that and more, filling the world with beautiful music.  But here he just fills a disc with boring love songs.  Even Barney would not take credit for this music.  Has Paul been hanging around with Michael Bolton? <br /> <br />I can understand Paul wanting to make a more introspective acoustic album.  Music does not have to be hard rocking to be good, but it should not be dull either.  Artists like Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash have all recently made such albums and done it well.  They pulled it off because they kept the music creative and edgy.  Chaos and Creation is about as edgy as a bowl of tomato soup. <br /> <br />This album leaves me wondering, what went wrong here?  Driving Rain had a lot of cool stuff on it, this album has none.  I tried to let this album grow on me, but it never did.  The lyrics on these songs are so simple and clichd that the first time I heard them I could almost tell what word was coming next in the phrase.  It is sad to say, but this album sounds like the work of a man who is creatively all tapped out.  I hope that is not the case.  I hate being so hard on Paul, but this album is just such a disappointment. <br />
0321213351|2.0|A number of times I thought I understand the refactoring after I read the summary at the beginning of each section, as well as the benefit and liabilities.  <br /> <br />However, I got myself into trouble when I started reading the source codes. Code snippet worked in certain occasions, but failed in others.  <br /> <br />The author could help readers like me if he could provide complete copies of source codes before after the refactoring on a CD or a web site.  <br />
0743454537|5.0|I loved the book, and although I thought the ending could have possibly been a little better, it is still something that could have happened in real life. <br /> <br />However, I must make the point that (SPOILER WARNING) Campbell was not driving in that last scene. If you read closely, it makes a reference to the driver being a \\"her\\", and so the driver must have been Julia and not Campbell. (END OF SPOILER) <br /> <br />I honestly don't like writing book reviews, but I had to at least write that. And the fact that I did actually really like this book, and I would definitely read another book by Jodi Picoult.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Here's a chance to catch the best new show of the 2004-2005 TV season - ratings challenged Veronica Mars.  While the ratings are low, it has a loyal following for a very good reason.<br /><br />In the seaside town of Neptune, California, there are the haves and the have-nots.  You're either one or the other with no middle ground.  Veronica used to be part of the popular click.  But that was before her best friend Lily was murdered, her rich boyfriend Duncan dumped her, and her father lost his job as the town Sheriff because of his handling of Lily's murder investigation.  While her dad opened a PI office, her mom split for parts unknown, leaving the two to cope with the changes in town.<br /><br />Because of her station as a former popular girl, Veronica doesn't fit into either crowd.  Fortunately, the detective skills she's learned from her dad help her make friends.  Seems like classmates are constantly coming to her to help with little things like bomb scares or missing pets.  Even teachers turn to her in times of crisis, like false accusations of statutory rape.  Along the way, Veronica begins to pick up pieces of the puzzle of Lily's murder.  Will she piece them all together and figure out who really done it?<br /><br />I tuned into the premier because several friends were planning to watch as well.  I was hooked from the start.  The show is smart with decent mysteries each week.  The clues to the season long mystery of Lily's death were tantalizing as well.  The show is definitely shown through Veronica's eyes, with her voiceover narrating events as well.  Veronica has a sarcastic sense of humor that livens things up and keeps the often-serious storyline from becoming too depressing.  Newcomer Kristen Bell does an outstanding job in the roll, believably hitting all the peaks and valleys each week.  It is rather funny to see Zachery Ty Bryant and Jonathan Taylor Thomas show up in guest rolls as high schoolers.<br /><br />The DVD was rushed out to help build interest in the currently playing season two.  As such, the list of extras is small, limited to some deleted scenes and a season long gag reel.<br /><br />Some of the plot lines are for the more mature, but teens and adults will love this smart, noir drama series.  If you haven't watched yet, this is the perfect chance to find out what you've been missing.build interest in the currently playing season two.

B00082IJ08|5.0|When I first heard about this CD, I heard that Dan The Automator and Del were gone. I almost didn't want to listen to it. But when I heard that Danger Mouse was Dan's replacement...I bought it sound unheard. And after hearing Feel Good Inc. on the radio, I knew The Mouse still had tricks up his sleeves - as well as the Gorillaz. Demon Days is by far, one of the best Cds i own - and one of the only ones i can listen to from beginning to end and never get sick of it. Now it's time to break it down track by track. <br /> <br />1. Intro - Short but sweet. The intricate pattern of this song, is so simple but at the same time so complex. The \\"food Chain\\" sample thing is great too. 5/5  <br /> <br />2. Last Living Souls - Another great song. Kind of a slower vibe than the rest of the album. But that just adds to the diversity. About halfway through the song it breaks down to an acoustic and a piano...and is simply amazing. Danger Mouse's String techniques come in and the song is great. 5/5 <br /> <br />3. Kids With Guns - Great Bass Line! so simple. but amazing. Great guitar riffs. great effects. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. O Green World - The intro fooled me. I thought i wasn't going to like the song but it's another great track. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Dirty Harry - Another great upbeat, groove song. synth in the breaks is great. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Feel Good Inc. - 1st single. Damon Albarn (2-D) sticks with his favorite little voice effect and it still works great for the songs. De La Soul definately filled the Funky Homosapien gap. Again, 5/5 <br /> <br />7. El Maana - Great slower song. Kind of like a second Tomorrow Comes Today. 5/5 <br /> <br />8. Every Plant We Reach Is Dead - Apparently my favorite word is great...but this album is jus amazing. Kind of slow again. but the beginning doesn't seem it. good song. period. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. November Has Come - MF DOOM! all that needs to be said..also..buy DangerDoom (Danger Mouse and MF DOOM)'s CD \\"The Mouse And The Mask\\" 6/5 <br /> <br />10. All Alone - Can't understand a one word Roots Manuva says, but i love the rythm. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. White Light - Short, Interesting, break is amazing Great 5/5 <br /> <br />12. DARE - 2nd Single, one of my favorites. the snyth in this song is amazing as well as the harmonies. The Mouse Really shines On This One. 5/5 <br /> <br />13. Fire Comming Out Of A Monkey's Head - Dennis Hopper reading a story, 2-D singing. What more could you ask for? 5/5 <br /> <br />14. Don't Get Lost In Heaven - Part One of the end. Amazing.  music is awesome, and the London Community Gospel Choir is displayed greatly on this (and the next) track. 6/5 <br /> <br />15. Demon Days - Again. Danger Mouse is ridiculously amazing. Thank you and Gorillaz fro making this CD. great way to end a Cd Part two of the end. <br /> <br />Overall an amazing Cd and technically the fourth in the Gorillaz collection, but actually only their second original release. Amazing!! Buy It Now
B000002UAR|5.0|To give this album anything less than a five star review is criminal. It's mind-boggling the influence this album and the band have had on music since their inception. I'll accept that somebody doesn't like the Beatles, though with the overwhelming influence they've had it's hard to imagine that to be the case, but there are those who fail to grasp the impact and importance. But, to say that this album is dated is to completely admit your ignorance and complete lack of musical knowledge. A few pointers: 1)Amazon places a \\"Iam over the age of 13\\" check box for a reason. Make sure that you understand and use it properly. 2) If you're going to be ignorant enough to give this classic album 1 star don't perpetuate your ignorance by allowing others to view your \\"OTHER REVIEWS\\". You continue to make yourself look small.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|After the epic concert at Budokan, Dream Theater comes with a new idea and a good new twist for its music.  Octavarium still resambles the same style, but the voice has found a new style that give the songs a very nice and original touch.  I recommend it very much as a hard-core DT fine, you cant miss it.
0895260131|1.0|This book is written by a hatemongering, ignorant idiot who has no real sense of what is going on in the world, but would rather continue to fan the flames of ignorant hatred. If you want to read a really good book on Islam read Bernard Lewis's book or you could read Fareed Zakaria's book, The Future of Freedom. (And imagine, it's written by a Muslim who doesn't want to blow up buildings and kill Christians.) What saddens me more than anything else is that there are so many reviews for this book that use words like \\"enlightening.\\" Nothing could be further from the truth. This may sound elitist, but stupid people should not be allowed to put their opinions out there for everyone to see. It might encourage more ignorant people to buy this awful book.
B00005JNQA|2.0|We suspend disbelief all the time. But the ending is plain insulting. That a character could hide, as suggested here, just ruins the movie.
B0001XAS1M|1.0|What else can you possibly say?  This album is ridiculous and annoying.  The worst of corporate rock.  Focus grouped music by committee.  Lowest common denominator.  If this is your music, then you are just not looking hard enough.  There is plenty of good music out there, honest.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie's good the first time and better the second time. If you're reading because you've seen this movie, liked it, and want to relive it through other people's reviews, please say this review was helpful. Better yet, go through all 1147 and counting and say all the positive ones were helpful and the negative ones were not.

0812550706|5.0|This novel is the greatest science fiction book that exists.  If you had to read only one science fiction novel in your life, this would be it.  This is not just a personal view, but also that of the website of the top 100 science fiction novels where anyone could vote and this came up as the number 1 science fiction novel.  Since the website also included fantasy, The Lord of the Rings, as expected, came up as the number one over all, but for pure science fiction, this is it.  I read this book when it was passed around the office and everyone that read it, loved it.  This has everything good and exciting science fiction is known for, aliens, space war, fate of the human race.  Really it touches upon good and evil, which is a cross genre topic, so many not generally interested in science fiction can find it interesting.  Like the Matrix, Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, the main character is `the one' and all the responsibility that entails.  What would one do when everything depends on ones actions and decisions.  The basic plot I'm sure you've read elsewhere.  The book is somewhat historically similar to the conditions leading to the defeat of the Japanese in World War II and the difficult decisions made then.
0385338686|5.0|Oh my god.  This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The twists and turns are amazing.  A truly delightful book and a definite must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The characters take on a life of their own and once you get into the book you feel like they are real life people.  I laughed out loud as I was reading this book (good thing I was home).
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This CD is incredible!  All of The Eagles great songs and some fascinating interviews with the band members.  Play it on a big screen tv with surround sound and you'll swear you're there!  Very, very well done!  The Eagles are a first class band!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles demonstrate why they're the best. You'll be dancing all night long! Even my kids (9, 11, & 13) love it! It just goes to show how good music transcends generations. Buy it, you'll Love it!
038551123X|4.0|This is shaping up as a very nice series. Dexter is a very orginal concept and Lindsay's light amusing touch turns these books into \\"Fun to Read\\". <br /> <br />I have to say I'm finding Dexter's development fascinating. Dexter reminds me of a Miami verson of Parker's Spencer, a wise cracking monster with good values.  <br /> <br />This is a book to read when you need cheering up or are having problems sticking to one book. You won't be able to put Dexter down. Buy this book and enjoy.
B0009YA386|4.0|The editors are a good band - really good, in fact.  Great music, a great voice that's somewhere between Joy Division's Ian Curtis and Dead Can Dance's Brendan Perry, and great catchy hooks.  So why are they just really good, and not truly great?  Because they take that catchy hook that sounds so good and they run it into the ground.  They're hanging onto their punk roots, and holding themselves down.  It's like a contest - how many times can he repeat the chorus before I give in and skip ahead to the next track?  I got it the first 20 times you said it, Tom - write another verse, already!  If they had more verses than chorus repetitions, or at least an equal number, that could catapult them to true greatness.
0060930187|3.0|I opened the book and found it a quick read, but I noticed that something was missing. Then I figured it out. Sylvia Plath's brilliance is contained in her poetry. Her book does convey her message quite well (at least what most people consider the message to be) and it is fantastically well written and contains many of the contrasts and comparisons betweeen two seemingly very unrelated things, which distinguishes her work, but it lacks luster. It seems great upon first read, but when compared to her poetry, it is like a candle that is lit, but sputtering. I think her book is a more logical explanation of her madness, but it doesn't make her seem like she is mentally ill. She makes you feel like she is healthy and the rest of the world is sick. Kudos for putting us in her shoes. But aside from that, the rest of the story seems drab, despite the imagery. It didn't evoke many feelings in me. I think literature is meant to stir and inspire. But maybe she just wanted us to feel nothing at all, as if we were trapped under a bell jar and the only thing you can feel is the pain which is so persistant that eventually you become used to it and don't feel it anymore. I guess that's the reason I didn't like the book as well as I should have. She intended for us to feel nothing at all.
B000AMF7BK|5.0|I was able to catch Sigur Ros in Las Vegas a couple weeks ago. The Cd is.. amazing, I mean the last few albums have been not only groundbreaking musically, but.. very emotionally charging and inspiring music. <br /> <br />Then I saw Sigur Ros live. <br /> <br />heh, I don't care waht your favorite genre is, or what kind of music you prefer...  do your a self a favor, pick up atleast this album, as it is in my opinion, the most accessable of any previous Sigur Ros album.    and for god sakes, see them live... you'll never forget it.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|Let's get right down to it...if you don't own all of his solo albums, you should.  They're hardly an easy listen, the man did like to challenge his audience, but with the Abbey Road remix and remastering team on board, John's solo stuff is getting the aural clean-up it deserves. <br />I'm not going to analyze the songs.  I bought it today for the remixes, and they're there alright, with varied results.  \\"Instant Karma\\" is in gorgeous stereo, much clearer mix, but the vocal is still distorted, just like Phil intended.  \\"Woman Is The Nigger Of The World\\" seems to have lost some of punch, but there are some nice lead guitar lines and string parts that were previously impossible to pick out.  John's vocal is clearer, and technically, his singing is unbelievable on this track.  \\"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\\" sounds amazing as well, with great separation of the instruments which wasn't the case before.  \\"#9 Dream\\" should have been left alone - the original mix was perfect, and hearing the balance changed is pretty unnerving - someone messed up the EQ on Keltner's toms, and now they sound out of place.  \\"Bless You\\" sounds great, like it was recorded yesterday.  \\"Nobody Loves You\\" also suffers from too much clean-up on John's vocal - it no longer sounds gruff, deep and down and out.  Someone pulled all of that out of the mix, now it's very trebly.  Still, the band and strings sound incredible on that and all of the remixed \\"Walls & Bridges\\" tracks. <br />Now, will the Abbey Road staff and Apple PLEASE get it together and start remixing and remastering The Beatles catalog for 24-bit in 5.1 sound???
B00004T9UF|5.0|Miss Lizz Mendez Berry, the person who wrote the \\"official Amazon review\\" of this album is an idiot. I do not understand why the reviewer's political opinion is being included in the reviews of an artist's personal statement. If every one was politically correct, then we would all be exactly the same; clones of our money-run government, who can't think for ourselves. While I, personally, am not a fan of rap music, and while I certainly do not agree with racism or homophobic bigotry, I respect Eminem for speaking his mind, and making a brutally honest piece of art, no matter what everyone else thinks. If no one spoke what they thought, even if it wasn't politically correct, then guess what? We would still have slavery, and everything else that was changed when some one finally decided to speak their mind. <br /> <br />So to put it short; if you are expecting some mindless tool singing about a bunch of crap that will not make you think or feel, (God forbid you are offended!) then spend your money on some thing else. But if you want the exact opposite, then this is good album for you.
B000062YAZ|5.0|the best of Slayer. <br />\\"The\\"  Album ,by \\"The\\" Group !
0525948023|5.0|If all of you who knew Mr. Tolle way back when had read the preface to The Power of Now, you would have learned that the person you knew underwent perhaps the most profound spiritual transformation possible around the time of his 29th birthday.  It would not surprise me if that person was arrogant, egotistical, sexist, or worse.  He himself suffered from this egotism to the point of contemplating suicide. <br /> <br />I think it's be safe to assume that the person that emerged from that single transformative experience, lived his teaching for twenty years and began to write it down only recently, bears little relation to the person you knew. <br /> <br />Though I've never met Mr. Tolle, I can imagine that the personality of a fully-realized, or \\"enlightened\\" human being might still manage to offend certain people.  The enlightened state is one of both detachment and great compassion; ironically, the detachment of egolessness can easily be misinterpreted as egotism.  I believe Ramana Maharshi appeared that way to some.  See the Tao te Ching (Stephen Mitchell translation) for a more detailed description of such a person. <br /> <br />And once again, even if Mr. Tolle could not embody his teaching 100% of the time, it detracts nothing from his works.  The proof of the value of his teaching lies in the lives transformed by it, such as mine, from one of brooding, self-involvment, and pain, to lightness, joy and ease.   <br /> <br />Pick up a copy and give it a try.  Just keep reading it, and try to live with the teaching.   <br /> <br />Review: I have not read this new book yet, but thus far the original is my favorite book.  I can go back time and again.  In Stillness Speaks, Tolle experimented with a more concise, poetic style that I believe did not suit him as well as his extended discourses.  From the sounds of things, his new book goes back to that original style.
0375703764|5.0|This book is unlike anything you'll ever read. If you let it, it will invade your life and change your perspective. Well worth it, if you can handle it's terminal uniqueness.
B0000UJL96|5.0|The Undiscovered Country wraps up the original series quite nicely. It helps to connect the original series with The Next Generation, and its dark, militaristic atmosphere really set it apart. Plus, Nicholas Meyer, the man who brought The Wrath of Khan to life, is sitting in the director's chair once again. <br />The movie is a great commentary on prejudice, and portrays a great parallel to the fall of the Soviet Union when the Klingon Empire reaches out to the Federation. The set design is great, as are the special effects and makeup. The character of Martia has a wonderfully distinctive avian look, and General Chang stands out from the rest of the Klingons, not just in his sleek, hairless appearance, but also in his habit of quoting and paraphrasing Shakespeare (whose Hamlet provided the movie's title). <br />Some appearances worth noting are Michael Dorn, playing an ancestor of his character Worf, and Rene Auberjonois, later known for his role as Constable Odo, plays a Starfleet officer named Colonel West. <br />Star Trek VI is a very good movie, and I recommend it to anyone.
0689878451|5.0|Wonderful story (all the better for being based on fact), well written and great illustrations. Really relevant and useful book for discussing same-sex parent families with young children. One of the best on the subject I have come across.
B00008H2LB|4.0|First of all, don't believe all the one star raters. Notice that they don't actually go into detail about the cd. This is because they haven't listened to it and all they want to do is bring the band down. <br /> <br />IF you hate a band so much, don't write a review with no actual information about the cd! <br /> <br />My first thought about the cd was that it was better than Hybrid Theory. It is more catchy and diverse. On other hand, you can't play it 20 times in a row like Hybrid Theory. Still, it has a few great songs like Numb, Breaking the Habit, Somewhere I Belong, and From the Inside. <br /> <br /> <br />Foreward/Don't Stay- 8 <br />Somewhere I Belong- 9 <br />Lying From You- 8 <br />Hit The Floor- 7 <br />Easier To Run- 9 <br />Faint- 8 <br />Figure.09- 8 <br />Breaking The Habit- 10 <br />From The Inside- 9 <br />Nobody's Listening- 8 <br />Session- 7 <br />Numb- 10 <br /> <br />I listen to many genres and artists like coldplay, green day, evanescence, Black eyed peas, and even some country so don't say that im a nu-metal lover. Take me seriously!
B000002AGE|5.0|Heavy Weather was not the dawn of a new era, it was the pinnacle of  the era in which it existed. This era was started by Miles Davis with the release of Bitches' Brew, which marked the end of traditional jazz music and gave rise to a new era of synthesizers, recording effects, and fusion with rock music (hence, \\"fusion jazz.\\"). <br /> <br />Two artists from this Miles Davis, two of the artists which helped begin this particular age of jazz, also played on this album. They were saxophonist Wayne Shorter and keyboardist Joe Zawinul, two of the founding members of the group. Even before Weather Report, they were widely hailed as some of the world's greatest jazz musicians. <br /> <br />This album would also help solidify the reputations of the other members of Weather Report: bassist Jaco Pastorius, percussionist Alex Acuna, and drummer Peter Erskine. Pastorius gets a special note here, he is hailed by most bassists (including myself) to be the greatest electric bassist of all time.  <br /> <br />This album has 8 tracks, 5 of which (Birdland, A Remark You Made, Teen Town, Palladium, and Havona) are some of the greatest songs ever played. 3 of the very greatest jazz musicians of all time, 8 songs, 8 bucks, just buy it!

B00024BHTC|5.0|finnish metal band nightwish strikes again with this great cd.  Although this is the common version i got like the super rare unreleased finnish exclusive cd i'm writing a review for this one because i cannot find the one i bought on amazon, note: if you want to shell out an extra of about 2 dollars do so and find the rare version because it includes the orchestral version of nemo which you can only find here or on the single nemo pt. 2. <br /> <br />this cd is great and i bought it after hearing \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\" in Alone in the Dark's Soundtrack (Great CD BUY IT NOW!!!) <br />this probably being one of the most played songs off this album.  My favorite song though is nemo which is great i love the piano intro to this song and the short but good guitar solo keeps things fresh.  Well, whether you are a die hard nightwish fan or this is your introduction to the band this cd is a great addition or begining to your nightwish collection. <br /> <br />ps. for everyone that knows how to play piano the intro to nemo is... d,d,c,d,a,d,d,c,d,f,c,c,d,a,g,f,e,c,d.  ENJOY!!!

B000B5IPLK|2.0|to Me if Alicia Keys was as Talented as the Hype she gets then she would be out of this world. the Problems I have with Alicia Keys as a Artist:tired of Her pulling a Mary J.Bliege,Ashanti&Early Mariah Carey amongest others of  Song jacking:\\"Unbreakable\\" jacks Eddie Kendricks \\"Intimate Friends\\". just as Fallin jacked James Brown's \\"it's a Man's world\\". then on this Disc she covers Prince's How come u Don't Call me anymore?(Which she took all the Soul out of,Prince's version is soulful,Alicia's version is Calculated Frosted flakes.She covers the Rolling stones\\"Wild Horses  with Adam Levine of Maron 5 who Bores me already&doing this cover puts me to sleep. the best thing I can say about Alicia Keys is that Her Band is cool.Alicia Keys would be better served teaming up with folks like a Carol King,Patrice Rushen,Brenda Russell or a Roberta Flack in terms of Bringing Words&Music together better.right now Alicia Keys is still trying to find a Idenity.she is trying to appeal to all segements&in a hurry.She wants to Project a Classical Piano Playing Hip-Hop R&B/Pop Musician who is cool with everybody.but the Bottom line is that at best She is just marginal.the chick is Sexy,but Appeal doesn't make you a Superstar&Jacking songs doesn't have long term appeal either.at the end of the day if Mary J Bliege or Ashanti Played Piano how much better would Alicia Keys look then to you?? MTV knew this is sure money,but all the Hype can't cover the lack of Originality&Idenity as a Artist.will the real Alicia Keys Ever please stand Up?? we may never know.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon started out as \\"Eclipse: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\\" and has become one of the leading examples of the concept album. Pink Floyd went into the Abbey Road studio in June 1972 and in the following months recorded 10 songs, which gel into a single track. Due to the space constraints on the original vinyl pressing, this was broken into two parts, with side one ending with \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and side two beginning with \\"Money\\". Although \\"Money\\" did achieve success as a single, the album is not set up as a string of singles and \\"filler\\", but as a single unit. Many a theory has been written on the material, from synchronicity, which can be observed when watching the MGM movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" in conjunction with the album, to the deeper meaning of the lyrics in regard to compassion, greed, lunacy, conflict and war. <br /> <br />This album showcases Pink Floyd's mastery of their instruments in general and of the studio in particular. In an age before computer-controlled mixing desks, Pro Tools and countless available tracks were at the disposal of musicians, the Floyd were able to create a sound, which is still unsurpassed today. Even after repeated listening new details and sonic surprises appear. The 10 pieces featured on this album cover everything from slow, spacious piano, odd 7/8 time signatures to the incredible vocal performance by Clare Torrey in \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\". <br /> <br />When compared to other albums and tracks recorded by Pink Floyd only \\"Echoes\\" from the \\"Meddle\\" album sounds faintly similar. Even after all these years Dark Side... still sounds fresh and not dated in the slightest. From the opening heart beats, to the cash register sounds, recorded interview voices, outstanding singing, beautiful piano and Hammond organ parts, tasteful and inventive drumming, to synthesizer sounds and pure rock solos everything fits perfectly. Few albums come close to achieving the sales records Dark Side... has. But will those otheralbums still sound so stunning 30 years later?
0783226837|5.0|This movie is fun from the start.  This movie has all the \\"cheese\\" the old 50's sci-fi horror movies had and enough comedy to make you forget the cheese.
B000A3DFZE|1.0|Eric Clapton truly has a golden voice and is one of the tastiest guitar players around, but this CD with lots of horns, added electronics and backing vocals sounds like a good R&B album for music on hold / elevator music.  There is one good song on the album \\"One Day\\".  Eric Clapton needs to get some sleep and do an album by himself; I think this album would have been much better and most people would have enjoyed this album if it was just Eric and an acoustic guitar on it...
B000B5IPLK|1.0|I am so, SO disappointed in this album. When I think of Unplugged I think of raw, in-depth performances. Alicia is great on this album but I did NOT buy it to hear her back-up singers sing over her and most of the songs. This album was a waste of my money. Wild Horses was one of the worst covers (thanks to Adam Levine) that I've ever heard. I re-sold it the day after I bought it.
B000B0WODA|1.0|Every day I hear the Killers on the radio (no choice really) because they force it down your throat here in San Diego.  Theyve recently decided its a good idea to mix in Franz Ferdinkook, probably because they figure I dont have to deal with enough rotten horsesh*t from the Killers.  Franz Ferdinand is horrible, unimaginative, radio friendly garbage designed for sheep.  I guess your all sheep since you all seem to lap up Franz Ferdinand like a bunch of mindless idiots.  This music is so void of talent, I tend to doubt anyone that enjoys Franz Ferdinand has ever seen a monkey with 4 asses.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|This series definatly had potential. I really liked the characters and the story line had some substance.  I liked this because it didn't rely on stupid catch phrases, special effects, or sex to keeo viewers engaged.  There was a brand new universe created and it was created with originality.  I think I watched it too fast because I started to get tired of decifering their slang and I had to stop watching the DVDs for a month before I could finish them off.   I do understand why it has such a cult following.  It really grows on you and makes you want to see more, like any great sci-fi series.  (After you get through the slow parts.)

Every girl finds herself addicted to shopping or spending money in one way or another and Rebecca makes this characteristic hilarious...she just can't seem to help herself.   <br /> <br />She tries and tries to curb her spending then tries to make more money and get herself in all sorts of predicaments with lies and debt.  It's a hilarious story taking what's honestly a common female addiction to the extreme! <br />

0895260131|5.0|Most of us Westerners by now are awakening to the fact that Islam is not a \\"Religion of Peace\\" or that it is \\"The most tolerant of faiths.\\"  Too many bombs have gone off. We have believed these lies because we wanted to and because they fit into our assumptions about how a religion should be practiced.  In our mythical universe we liken Mohammed to Jesus - a benevolent man wandering around the Arabian desert preaching goodness to ones fellow man. At some point though, you have become suspicious that maybe there is something about Islam...that caused well-educated men fly airplanes into buildings, to yell Allah Akbar! when they sawed off the head of an infidel, to blow up a train, a hotel, a subway and themselves.  There is something about Islam...and Robert Spencer will tell you.  Everything he says is well documented and referenced so that you can check it out for yourself in case you don't want believe him.  Still, people will call him an Islamophobe.  They do not want to hear the truth. They do not want you to know the truth. That Mohammed was in reality a warrior, had all the men in a villiage beheaded, then handed over their wives and children to be slaves and raped by his followers.  They do not want to hear that as an old man he married a 6 year old, then consumated it with her at age nine and still playing with dolls. They do not want to hear that he told all his followers not to associate with us filthy infidels and that Jews are apes and pigs.  And yet he did.  All these things are in the Koran and documented in \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades).  Find out for yourself.
0316548189|2.0|Ya, sure Mandela is a great person, a personification of a accumulation of moral and ethical supremeness, but lets face it, this book sucks.  I had to read this for a high school english class, and it bored me to death.  So many facts, so many potentially useless information, its as if Mandela intentionally tried to put emphasis on the less entertaining portions in his life.  Personally, I dont see how all the other commentors could stand finishing this book.  Good story...badly written.
0312330529|1.0|Apart from the one-liners, which were sometimes brilliant, this was an extremely poorly written novel. The descriptions were cheesy, cliched, and unbelievably mango-breasty: \\"eyes the color of the desert before a rainstorm\\"... come on, that's terrible! <br /> <br />The stories about the slums, the prison, and the passport laundering were interesting, if you could get through the orientalist prose and suffer through his pathetically overwrought passages about Karla, her green eyes, her quick half-smile, and whatnot. <br /> <br />This book should have been a Bollywood movie. It had all the absurd constructs of Bollywood fantasies - the elusive love interest, guns and violence, a hard, lonely hero, the comic low-class Indian side-kick, and the evil gangsters and patriarchal wise men. <br /> <br />And if it had been a movie, at least it would have been over sooner.
B00014NE62|3.0|A very detailed and beautiful/refined looking show with good themes on gay love, conformity and class differences and well acted characters but a large deal is assumed that the viewer will know or will get without proper dramatization of those points or, in some cases, even mentioning them or showing background. Some statements/acts seem to come out of nowhere or aren't shown what's their significance. As the film progresses however and characters become more honest and open things become alot better for the viewer and the characters and story improves. The powerful values of love and honesty shine forth.<br /><br />I think most of this assumption is that you have read the book. For someone that has there is probably no issue, but for anyone who has not, the average viewer, the assumptions very much detract from the enjoyment of this beautiful flim.<br /><br />Note: Some nice nude shots, some cuddling but no real footage in the film of even \\"sanitized\\" sex. There is definitely intimacy however.
1896597890|5.0|This is the sixth travelogue memoir I have read in the past year including Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis books (the best of the lot), Craig Thompson's Carnet de Voyage and Rick Smith's Baraka and Black Magic in Morocco (the worst of the lot). This book is somewhere between Thompson's book (actually more of a traveling sketchbook than story) and Satrapi's tome of her youth in Iran.  As with Thompson's book, this is an outsider's view of things we may perceive as absurd (and though I believe most of what Delisle writes about is totally absurd and unbelievable, I also believe his depiction of North Korean existence under a dictator is probably very accurate).  This is an excellent beginning for Delisle and may be hard to follow.  I highly recommend the book.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the \\"Off The Wall\\" & \\"Thriller\\" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the \\"Bad\\" singles..the only one that was missing is \\"Liberian Girl\\" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from \\"Dangerous\\" are here besides \\"Jam\\". I am not sure why the title cut \\"Dangerous\\" included. That should of been where \\"Jam\\" should of been. Also the final single from the \\"Dangerous\\" album is not included \\"Gone Too Soon\\". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song \\"History\\" & One song from \\"Invincible\\"? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single \\"One More Chance\\"? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was certainly better than I expected.  I remember when it was on TV and the top rated shows were mostly \\"reality TV\\" (ie. people unlike most of us sitting around in unrealistic situations talking inanely).   <br /> <br />Perhaps with the diminishing interest in reality shows and renewed interest in this series through the movie release some TV network might invite the involved players to bring the show back.  It worked for Star Trek and its universe.  Why not Firefly? <br /> <br />While the marriage of westerns and sci-fi is unusual, given the chance, this show will grow on you.  It would be interesting to see where this show might go.

B000B5QWKG|4.0|The only place I've found where this CD works is my work laptop.  It doesn't work on any of the CD players at home or in my home computer--and YES, it is turned right side up.  Too much technology, and I can't even listen to this CD at home!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|This movie centers on the idea that most people take their lives for granted and don't care how they treat others or even themselves. But a new serial killer on the loose is trying to change their minds. The killer puts people in situations that require a major moral dilemma in order for them to live. Sadly, the actors in this movie don't seem to be able to portray any of their emotions on a convincing level and that takes away from the movie. It is still worth renting though and perhaps even seeing 'Saw II' which is coming soon to the movie theaters.
B0000507OD|4.0|Isn't The Battle Over Citizen Kane included in the 2-disc Citizen Kane? If I'm right, why buy the doc when you get it with the movie? Sorry, but I saw Kane and Battle were paired as recommended package deal. That makes no sense to me.
0802130208|5.0|I read this book when it was first released in the late 1970's. It was recommended to me by my father, an avid reader and bibliophile. I was only 18 years old, but this wonderous novel had the same impact as CATCH 22 or RAGTIME did for me. I knew this book would be with me my whole life, and that I would return to it time and again. I have since read it four times, and I just finished it again late this evening. Instead of sleeping I decided to write some slender memories: seeing John Kennedy Toole's mother on THE TOM SNYDER SHOW in the early 1980's had a profound impact on me. When she told of her son's struggles and difficulties getting this work published, prior to taking his own life at a criminally young age, I realized that it is one of life's great mysteries how so many publishers passed on this book. It was only at the urging of Walker Percy that the LSU press first published this masterpiece.  Being blind to genius is a universal privilege, after all! <br /> <br />On my fifth complete reading I still laughed as Ignatius rolls his hot dog cart down the street with the sign \\"12 Inches of Paradise\\" handwritten on the side. And I was once again felt melancholic when I finished this book, because I will never be able to read another novel by this misunderstood literary genius. Ah Fortuna, what a cruel vixen you are.......
B000AQBA1W|5.0|The latest album by the Corrs is an instant classic! Every song is beautiful and full of emotions and the vocals by Andrea Corr are pure heaven! The Corrs pulled out their late mother's favorite Irish tunes and reworked them in their own beautiful way. Favs are My lagan love,Buachaill on Eirne, Old Hag, Old Town, Dimming of the day but theres not a bad track on the cd. Be sure to buy this album and experience a little bit of the wonderful place that is Ireland!  <br />
B00006RCNW|5.0|Very few police dramas expand or redefine the genre. Dragnet, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue and CSI are among the few that have. Add to that very select list, The Shield.<br /><br />Although Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue featured police officers straying into gray areas of morality, in The Shield, cops operating outside the law are the center of the action. Like in the Sopranos, viewers are challenged by these characters: Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) isn't a good guy, he isn't a bad guy, he's something in between. To Vic, his rogue behavior serves the public interest. To everyone else, a cop with a pet crack dealing operation who murders, plants evidence and savagely beats suspects is a danger who needs to be taken off the street. But Vic is an old pro at this, and viewers get to watch him attempt to out-maneuver the forces trying to take him down, and not always for the best of reasons.<br /><br />But the show is an ensemble, as the best cop shows have been, and everyone from beat cops to detectives to the police captain get their moments to shine. Especially impressive is Detective Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder), who radiates morality, maturity and wisdom. Claudette has to deal with an over-eager partner (who, on paper, the audience should love, but who in practice practically invites the abuse the other officers heap upon him), a politically minded captain and, of course, the Strike Team, led by the obviously corrupt Vic Mackey.<br /><br />Bear in mind that the series, which will begin its fifth season in January 2006, is constructed in 13 episode arcs. At times, the first few episodes will seem slow, but it's always building to a shattering conclusion at the end of each season.<br /><br />This is one of the few television shows that can justly be called a classic. More importantly, The Shield redefines what audiences can and should expect from police dramas in the years to come.<br /><br />Strongly recommended to fans of police dramas. Be warned that The Shield skirts an R rating much of the time, especially in the adult and dark subject matter.e Shield skirts an R rating much of the time, especially in the adult and dark subject matter.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|Joe Hisaishi has worked with Hayao Miyazaki for most of this cult director's award winning animations. It's almost like a John Williams-Steven Spielberg or Danny Elfman-Tim Burton partnership. And the good thing is this merge of geniuses really works.  The original score to HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a gem.    The original score to SPIRITED AWAY was treasure; it was a complete misfortune that it was not nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Score. Never mind that. But just note that if you've somehow wanted to buy either SPIRITED AWAY or HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, then buy both, because you're sure to like them.    The original score to HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE revolves around one main key theme. Watch the movie, or test the CD, you're sure to catch it. It appears on almost every track. But that's not necessarily a bad thing (just in case you're wondering that if every track sounds the same, it must be dead boring). Joe Hisaishi has crafted a very memorable and instantly likeable tune, and milked it for what it's worth. But he uses the main theme in different variations and tempo. There is your typical minor key to signify danger or that something mysterious, but in general there are two standard variations.    The first is the 'merry-go-round' type music. Some may think that it is (also) similar to some grand ball during the 17th or 18th century. Indeed, this piece of fast paced, light hearted music evokes a certain grandeur, yet manages to transport the listener to a far-away magical, fantasy kingdom. There are even hints of accordion, meaning that you might hear some Parisian sidewalk cafe-type music. This piece gives the listener a very warm and cosy feeling too, as if sitting in front of a fireplace, on a winter's night, snow falling outside, wrapped in a nice woolly blanket. It's amazing how much this theme captures.    The second is a much slower, piano-heavy variation. It reminds me of John Williams in The Reunion on the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE soundtrack and RachelPortman in the Main Theme on THE CIDER HOUSE RULES soundtrack. It's very thoughtful, very emotional but such a pleasure to listen to.    Joe Hisaishi has generally sprinkled this masterpiece with the main two variations as described above here and there, with some other lively instrumentation and orchestra playing throughout. The style does not depart greatly from that found in SPIRITED AWAY. If you had to compare Joe Hisaishi to a Western composer, perhaps you would find great likeness in John Williams. A maestro in telling the story with his music, Joe Hisaishi's music sends images and scenes from the film into your head starting from Track 1. Joe Hisaishi's music, like John Williams, is occassionally grand, loud, lush and rich and at times quiet and serene - but just as powerful.    I'd recommend that you get this soundtrack. It's not your average cartoon music. It easily stands as one of the best soundtracks released this year (and perhaps years to come).    Liam Foo
B000067J1Q|4.0|It's a little embarassing but I admit it. I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out in '65 when I was a lovestruck, impressionable thirteen year old. I had quite a crush on Julie Andrews back then. But as the old adage goes, \\"The day eventually comes for childish things to be put away.\\" After watching this movie recently on DVD I think this might be one of \\"those things.\\"<br /><br />Yes, the scenery is magnificent, the Bavarian/Austrian architecture superb, the music delightful (though overly sachrine) and seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful dancing across the Alps brings back wonderful memories and youthful fantasies. But that's good for about thirty minutes and then what? Maybe I've just become jaded as I've grown older, but I now find the blatant overacting and the excessive sentimentality difficult to watch. Whatever the case maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is best remembered as a pleasant memory of my youth and leave it at that.<br /><br />With that said, I still can't give it less than - 4 Stars - just for old-times sake and those lingering feelings for Julie Andrews. A great movie if you have young children, or if you're really nostalgic about this genre of film. Otherwise look for something more challenging.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  Alicia Keys is trully talented and very soulful.  The one song I can listen to over and over is \\"If I Was Your Women.\\"  She sings this song with so much emotion it gives me chills.  This is a must have for any CD collection.
B0001I55SS|4.0|This movie is all about artistic SFX. The dialogue is silly at times and the characters are fairly uni-dimensional. Vincent the robot is really a cheesy looking droid compared to something like R2D2. So, why am I giving it 4 stars? because I like this film mostly for the way it looks. I love the Cygnus, I think it is a very elegant ship and I am in the process of building a 10\\" model from scratch. Overall: GOOD in a different way.

B000002I6X|3.0|This album was originally released in 1971.  It has 12 songs and the total time is 43 minutes.  The sound quality of the original CD is good, but not excellent.  It does have some problems with level control.  Some of the songs are very quiet, requiring you to crank up the volume.  And then, the next song will be very loud.  Is there a remastered version of this CD yet? <br /> <br />With the exception of three tracks, all the songs on this CD are very good.  That have that Stephen Stills atmosphere about them.  Some of them sound as if Crosby, Stills and Nash could have done them (especially since Crosby does background vocals).   <br /> <br />A number of tracks have horns.  Some people call it a wall of sound, referring to Barry Gordy and Motown.  I think it is more of the style of the time, driven by groups like Chicago and Blood, Sweat and Tears.  Many groups were including horns and brass at the time.  On this CD, sometimes it works well and sometimes it doesn't. <br /> <br />A number of the songs sound dated.  They aren't bad.  They just have that sound that you know came from the late sixties.  So, when this album came out in 1971, it had a little of a dated feel. <br /> <br />There are 3 songs that I don't really like, Sugar Babe, Marianne and Bluebird Revisted. <br /> <br />Sugar Babe is not to be confused with the Youngbloods song, Sugar Babe, which came out a little earlier.  This might be one of the worst songs Stills has written, with pretty bad lyrics. <br /> <br />Marianne, along with Change Parnters, was the a hit from the CD.  To me, it is a basic pop hit without much character.   <br /> <br />When I was a kid, Bluebird was one of my favorite songs.  It was also the Buffalo Springfield concert jam number.  They would play it for 20 minutes or more (I never got to see them but once heard a bootleg).  This new, slowed down and stretched out version called Bluebird Revisited is a major disappointment.  There is no soul to the song.  It sounds like something one of those cover groups from the seventies, like Up With People, would do. <br /> <br />But, overall my complaints are minor.  This is a great CD to pop in and be taken back to the early seventies.   <br />
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Oh my God. If I had one word to describe the unspeakable bilge that is Firefly, it would be poop. <br />As I settled down with my cup of beef tea, a bowl of crackajaks and my favourite starwars action figures, I expected a show that would reflect the hype, the hyperbole and the excitement that surrounded the DVD box set. My love for the captain, born out of staring at my captain action figure, soon dissapated as I realised that this really was just a space western, only with worse special effects than an arcade game circa 1985. bip bip bip, oh no captain, the reevers are coming, at worst they will bum us, eat our flesh and tear our very eyes from the sockets, before grinding us up for their bovril, and if you're very lucky, they'll do it in that order. <br />Dont worry though, because the simpering female mechanic with the bad teeth, despite having a bullet hole in her abdomen, will instruct the preacher to put Serenity on full darn throttle and blast those pesky reevers into space route 66.  <br />Well, perhaps I had expected way too much. My Stupid nerdy friends told me it rocked, and the guys were hot, and it was like star wars, but, without the force. <br />No force, but certainly farce, as this bumbling crew of bad actors and tinny special effects, throw in a few horses, a bad tempered captain (who, incidently, despite sometimes bending the rules, always gets results) and a ship whore, who, for some reason, doesnt whore once despite getting my hopes up. (how DOES she pay the captain for the rent on her ship bordello if she has no johns.....? hmmmmmmm me wonders....ay ay captain honk honk) <br />I hated it, don't buy it, unless of course you like being slowly bored to frikkin death, sandwiched between a bunch of people who wouldnt know hair serum if it jumped up and whacked them around the head.  <br />No force, no fun, I'm going home to play with my Red Dwarf action figures and rest my coffee on the Firefly DVD which is now a pretty expensive coaster.  <br />fin
B000B8I8X2|2.0|there are a lot of songs on this album that just plain suck.  do yourself a favor.  save your money & go to itunes or another downloading program and get the dagger, independent, and absolutley get rich man.  those 3 songs are the only ones that made the album anything at all.  the rest of the songs just seem to be fillers.  i really wanted to give this album a good review, but i can not because of the inconsistancy of quality songs on the album
B00005G8NH|5.0|In many reviews, I see that we compare Apple's first CD to this one. We always come to the conclusion that her first is better because none of the songs on When the Pawn compared to Criminal. <br />And after much deliberation, I've decided that that theory is false. When the Pawn seems completely like the song Criminal, blended with the hauntingness of Shadowboxer, and with a deeper toned Fiona. The odd random little noises that make Criminal awesome appear over the entire album and her lyrics all seem so sexy in this naughty unsung way. Her piano demands attention in a way that we never heard in Tidal and her voice, husky and deep, seems to have forgotten the self-conciousness that clouded her first album and instead, speaks bravely and unabashedly. Something that, while listening to the CD, I can imagine myself doing though I might never do so.
B000002897|4.0|This record got a decent amount of attention for a Seattle band that wasn't Soundgarden or Nirvana. Thanks to Nearly Lost You and the movie, Singles, music fans at least heard SOME of this great record.

So, bying the DVDs is a great opportunity for fans of Jane Austen to watch on our own tv screens the images we create in our minds when we read her masterpiece, which is Pride and Prejudice.
B000002LCI|5.0|In my opinion, this is their best album. <br />4 Big hits (Behind the Wheel, Never Let Me Down Again, Little 15 - my favorite - and Strangelove), plus wonderful little-known songs like the instrumental Pimpf and the two songs sang by Martin Gore, I Want You Now and The Things You Said.
B00000I01A|5.0|This truly is great music. Some people think that just because its from the 80's, its bad. NOT TRUE! i enjoy listening to this music in the car from place to place, its very addicting! <br />          this music is also good when excercising. if your lifting weights, running, or doin any phisical activity, play this music real LOUD!!!! it gets you pumped up and wanting to do more. I lost wait from exercising recently, and i know a big part of it was being inspired by this great soundtrack. it can really boost you not just for exercising, but even for just getting u in a good mood. before u completely forget it, at least listen to the free 30 second samples above, trust me, youll love 'em!!
B000AXSN5G|3.0|Fans of Harvest and that country rock genre of Neil Young's will hear that familiar style in Prairie Wind, but this new album lacks something important lyrically.  The words just don't seem to have been written with the tunes in mind. They're plastered over the music carelessly, compromising the beauty of the tunes. Maybe he thought the words themselves were more important than how they mesh with the music to form the whole song; fair enough, but it doesn't make for great music. If you like Neil's beautiful country rock, I highly recommend Harvest, Harvest Moon, and After the Goldrush instead.
0525948023|3.0|(I give it *** and 1/2 stars)  I enjoyed Eckhart's earlier book and have read it several times. I am not a big one for listening to talks on CD and such, but I see there are several out there to choose from. There seems to be  an entire industry built around Tolle and yes, he's making money. Okay. <br /> <br />I also know that on his website, there are these pictures of him that you can actually buy, and I believe in various sizes! I think that's kind of ridiculous. As far as what one person may know of Tolle, I am sure he puts on that  \\"pious\\" and virtuous impression quite well with many or probably, the majority of people.  <br /> <br />As an ideal, Tolle speaks of getting over the ego, etc. but those pictures? The money he's making? To me, he looks like  the proverbial cat that swallowed the canary! <br /> <br />You New Agers! <br /> <br />I did hear Eckhart speak at an event, and  I definitely saw someone who's got quite an ego. Sorry. It's what I witnessed and I don't altogether buy his \\"persona\\".  These others have a right  to say what they experienced with the man and to say that they are coming from this bs about a \\"pain body \\" is  pathetic if not, presumptuous. You have an unpleasant experience. You say something--especially about a person who contributed to that so-called state, and claims he's so knowing about such things. <br /> <br />I  think there are people who are so loyal to this man, they don't want to see anything else. And that can be dangerous. <br /> <br />But I have to admit, I like this guy's work!  <br />

0316172324|1.0|In the 'blink' of an eye, I knew this book would be a waste of my time, yet I continued to read it because I wanted to give it a chance.  After all, everyone and their mom was raving about what an 'enlightening' experience this book was.  Gladwell does little more than give new examples to old ideas, and I'm not really sure if he thinks split-second decisions are a good thing or a bad thing.  I quit reading after the chapter about Van Riper's big victory, so maybe all the interesting stuff is in the end of the book (I wouldn't know because I kept falling asleep by this time).  This book was overrated. If you want to hear a bunch of mindless psychobable, just watch the Dr. Phil show (cbs 4et,3ct)

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock was a true genius in terms of making a good thriller or horror film, and he invented the slasher genre for many filmmakers to follow. PSYCHO is the ultimate testament to that, and along with THE BIRDS, established Hitchcock as a true visionary with the movies.  <br /> <br />Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane (with such gusto too!), a woman unhappy with her job at a real-estate establishment. But when a man comes in with a bunch of money to invest, Marion suddenly develops other ideas on her way to the bank and decides to run with the money, ultimately changing the outcome of her life. She runs into the police, but nothing happens and she heads to the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates (played perfectly by Anthony Perkins) and is completely unaware of his evil nature.  <br /> <br />One of the most shocking happenings of the movie is the killing of Marion only 30 minutes into the movie, something no bold filmmaker (except Hitchcock) would dare do. The rest of the movie unravels the madness of Norman's world and the madness of his mother, and you'll find not what you're expecting. The end shot of the film of Norman's face features a creepy on shot of a superimposed skull and it will leave chills on you.  <br /> <br />When Hitchcock made PSYCHO he made sure that all the theater owners closed the doors after the movie started to make it an enormously successful device, and it worked. PSYCHO is not only a masterpiece, but a lesson that sometimes the person next to you might not be who you think they are. Definitely a must-own, a must-buy, and a must-see!
0141301155|3.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory      I think Charlie and the chocolate factory is a good book. I think kids should read it. I like the Oompa----Loompas songs when the kids get lost. I have read better books than it though, so I will give it an eight out of 10.  It is still a good book to me. I don't think some parents would let their kids read it though because of some of the bad language used. I wish that they talked about chocolate more because I like it. I think he should have had chocolate more than gum. It was good thinking to put Charlie's golden ticket last because it made the reader wonder what's going to happen. (...)I think it was nice thinking to put it in there.
B000B0WODA|5.0|For the most part, this CD kills. Fast paced and includes many different new elements for the Scottish gang. Superb grooves and riffs, and more attention to detail on the melodies and bridges. I like the forward progression for each song, there are a few that remind the listener of Louis XIV, or QOSA they are less repetitive and more technical than those on the first album. Some of the slow songs are just ok, one in particular is super sick though and quite enjoyable. There are many pace changes,momentum swings, and sections of songs that seem to include a double kick drum for the beat (CD almost seems to skip) -pretty cool, on the whole a great rock album. Monster rip on track 3, with a surf riff to it, almost reminds me a bit of Dick Dale.     I gave this album 5 stars because the 2-3 songs that are more filler really do not need to be on the album, as there are lots of songs on the disc, pick it up.

B000002JNJ|5.0|Out of all my pantera cds I do belive this is my favorite. (2nd being trendkill) This was the cd that introduced me into the world of pantera. I remember the first time I heard the opening riffs to cowboys from hell and knowing from that moment on that my outlook on guitar playing woulnd never be the same. There has been alot of dime bashing all over pantera reviews, and to be honest it makes me sick. I fully understand the complaints about phills voice because I can understand how it wouldnt be appealing to people, but people are trying to say the dime was a 3 chord musician....like I have said in previous reviews, take one listen to songs like floods or cemetary gates these posers will be eating there words. <br />  but back to the record...I do belive this was one of panteras first records (unless you count there hard core 80's sounding records lol) but the 80's vocals are evident on this record, so if you are not a fan of the high pitched voice, I suggest getting a differet record. some of my favs on here are cementary gates and cowboys from hell. <br /> <br />RIP DIME BAG....you will always be missed
B00006G8K0|1.0|This is one of the movies that arrived 100% damaged, totally balck screen, I could not see any of the movies. I did return it and then, Amazon com refunded me. I would love to get this movie, but what garantee am I going to have that it is not going to arrive damaged again? It came damaged twice when I ordered the collection \\"Hammer Horror Collection\\" and when I ordered separated. Please review and if you are interested in sending that one to me, I am INTERESTED in buying, however, I want you to open it up, test it out in two computers, two dvD FIRST, so that we all make sure it is REALLY working.  <br />Thank you, <br />Jacqueline Grecco <br /> <br />
B00005B4GU|5.0|I have a hard time creating an ordered \\"best album\\" list for Radiohead. Practically everything they've done (minus Pablo Honey) is absolutely brilliant, and Amnesiac is right up there with Kid A and OK Computer. I don't agree with the appraisals that call it expiramental or challenging in comparison to Kid A. Then again, I wouldn't think of either album as being particularly \\"difficult\\" to get. Perhaps the most elusive aspect of Amnesiac is due to the wide variety of musical styles it tackles (all the while retaining the band's signature and unique sound).<br /><br />On the contrary, I find it difficult to understand how songs like \\"Life in a Glass House\\" and \\"You and Whose Army?\\" could fail to immediately grab the listener. They're infectiously evocative and beautiful. The single \\"Pyramid Song\\" is one of the most visual and atmospheric songs I've ever heard. True, there is a harshness and an intentionally cold/lonely sound to some of the songs, but Amnesiac also features some of the band's most tongue-in-cheek tracks; such as the driving and quirky \\"Pakt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box.\\"<br /><br />This album is also possibly their greatest achievment electronically. \\"Pulk Pull Revolving Doors\\" may not be radio friendly, but it's a brilliantly atmospheric and harsh instrumental (almost IDM) track; paying a somewhat large tribute to Tri Repatae era Autechre. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" may also not fit so well into a radio playlist, but it's blatantly pretty and moody in a way that fits perfectly into the album. The guitar atmosphere of \\"Hunting Bears\\" may not blow you out of your seat, but it's a short and essential movement in the album.<br /><br />There are a few low points on the album for me, but that would only be from the context in which they were framed. In particular, I thought \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Dollars and Cents\\" are fairly unremarkable by comparison. It could almost be said that Amnesiac does not have the same epic cohesiveness of Kid A, but I don't think that matters. It may be a companion piece of sorts, but it's more of a standard \\"collection of songs\\" album, while Kid A could almost be seen as a story or fully symphony. This is not to say that the album is disjointed or meandering in any way, I just think it needs to be understood differently when it is viewed as a complete album.<br /><br />In the end, Amnesiac is an amazing album, and I think that the future of music owes more to it's brilliance than people realize. This should be understood as a seminal album by what is probably the greatest band out there today, and to overlook it would be a grave mistake.t think that matters.

B000068PQ0|5.0|This CD has so many great songs that are wierd and fun and creepy at the same time.  My three year old daughter wants me to play the \\"robot songs\\" all the time and I can't argue with that.  I also like this because it is hard to find cool music that isn't offensive.  There isn't a song on this CD that I don't love.
B00006SKRX|5.0|Sometimes a piece of work is so esoteric and eccentric that it defies categorization and comprehension.    When Pros was first released in 1984, reviewers and listeners who like their rock music straight balked at having to deal with an album that was nothing like they had ever heard before.   Well, almost never heard before.    A year before Pros was released, Roger Waters, then still the primary force behind Pink Floyd, had created The Final Cut.       Together both albums occupy a singular place in music, and represent a totally new kind of approach to rock - one that struggled against the linear limitations of the form and strove to express a range and complexity of ideas and emotions within the confines of a 40 minute LP.     The Final Cut, essentially a lament to continuing war 50 years after the end of WWII, remains the more accessible of the two.   Pros is far more personal, a seemingly disparate and unsettling journey into the depths of human consciousness and sub-consciousness.   The album follows a sequence of dreams and nightmares a man, clearly Roger Waters himself, has in the course of one night.   In a deft touch that helps make this point, every song has a time prefix to show the time the man has the dream.      This concept serves as an excellent vehicle for Waters to create what he himself has said is his only album about only sex.   But it is sex in its deepest and fullest sense, and Pros explores the fears, fantasies, and challenges of middle age: from dreaming about seducing bright-eyed young hitchhikers, to divorce, loneliness, depression and, somewhat strangely for Waters, the redeeming power of love.      Apparently Waters wrote this album about the same time as The Wall and presented both ideas to the rest of Pink Floyd.   That the band chose The Wall is easy to understand, for, as band members later confessed, they felt awkward about working with material that was so intimate.   Waters was going through a hard time between 1977, when Animals was released, and 1984, when he broke with the band.  In-between, he also got divorced and struggled with some personal issues that he still has not spoken about publicly.   But the clich that pain produces passion is true, and this period was amongst the most creative of Waters' career.      If Waters was exorcising his personal demons through his music, then Pros is where a lot of them collected.   The album begins with a guitar lurch that has to be among the most dramatic openings of any rock record.   As the song-cycle progresses erratically, shuttling between vitriolic screams, nervous brooding and placid passages that show a gentle side of Waters that remained obscured on earlier albums, they create a nervous tension and sense of foreboding that invade the entire album.       In many ways this is vintage Waters: dark, intense, and evocative. But the one difference is that unlike earlier Waters albums that dealt with broad issues, this time the lyrics are precise, blunt.    They don't rhyme as the did on Dark Side of the Moon, and comparing Pros to this 1972 classic is like comparing a Dali dreamscape to a Manet landscape.   Waters' verses in Pros are sharp, asymmetrical and at first it seems as if the wordsmith in him didn't quite do the job.   But as one settles into the album, especially after a number of listens, one appreciates the dark edgy lines, the ingenious symbolism and the powerful imagery it creates.     Given the album's fixation on sex there's plenty of deep breathing, moaning and grunting.   But beyond that there is a sense of urgency and sensuality to the music lurking just beneath its somewhat perplexing exterior.     Waters voice also sounds different from the way it did on previous Pink Floyd albums, and here it has a drier, more somber quality.  Waters half-speaks, half-recites his lyrics rather than sings them, and in keeping with the albums startling shifts in dynamics, there are also sections in which he does some of his best singing.Musically, the roots of Pros are pure blues.  But, like Wish You Were Here that is also rooted in a slow blues rhythm, the blues blood in this album sometimes becomes unrecognizable because of the variations Waters takes it through.        The sound on many songs is sparse, much like The Final Cut, and at first listen a lot of the material sounds like just filler.   But Waters makes the best of the few notes and harmonies that frame many of the songs with his traditional attention to musical detail.  The timing on the album is excellent, and the arrangements, sound effects and instrumentation Waters uses combine to give all the songs poignancy and weight.    The 3 or so more traditionally structured songs on the album, such as Sexual Revolution and the title song, simply explode through your speakers.   These tracks are the closest Pros gets to previous Floydian albums, excepting The Final Cut, though here the sound is tighter and less atmospheric, so space rockers will be disappointed.    That Waters used his hunting mate Eric Clapton to replace David Gilmour as guitarist on this album is now part of rock lore.   Clapton's guitar work is masterful, and whether whispering or exploding into incendiary blues riffs, Clapton's guitar follows Waters erratic and innovative musical ideas effortlessly, giving perfect voice and tone to the range of moods the album demands.  True, Gilmour's mournful, moving sound would have been more suited to the album, but Clapton's precise and fluid playing is a pleasure.   People who attended the Pros concert tour said the music was even better live, though it was rumored Clapton found Waters' demands for precision tiresome.  Still, the two remain good friends.     To compensate for David Gilmour's absence in the vocals department Waters makes extensive use of background singers Doreen Chanteer, Katie Kissoon and Madeline Bell, who rise exceptionally well to the challenge.   Interestingly, Waters also makes extensive of the saxophone, the first time he has done this since Dark Side of the Moon.  David Sanborn is the man he chose on this album, and what a good choice it is.   In fact, Clapton, Sanborn and Michael Kamen, who co-produced the album and played piano on it, got along so well that they worked together to create the soundtrack for the movie Lethal Weapon.     Ultimately, it is the story Waters is trying to tell in Pros, and the message he is attaching to it, that make this album an essential part of any serious music lovers collection.   When a man tears his heart out and places it on vinyl, as say Leonard Cohen does, it is hard not to sit up and listen.   Pros may try our patience at first, but once inside this incredible work, it is hard to leave it, or have it leave you.
6305428271|5.0|I loved this when it first came out but that was years ago.  I had forgotten the entire movie.  Watching it today was so much better. The commitment to the students was overwhelming and the students reaction to a teacher that truly believes in them was very moving.  I cried like it was the first time I'd seen the movie. <br />
B00006M183|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Despite what some critics think, Pearl Jam has gone nowhere (and I mean that in a good way).  This band has matured, maybe moving past their early rebellious personality, but still a band with a conscience and certainly a sturdy moral compass.  My favorite tracks are Save You (reminding me of Hail Hail from the album No Code), I Am Mine, Get Right and You Are.  Eddie Vedder is still the best male vocalist in rock music today, and he and the rest of PJ should be proud of the direction they have gone; refusing to sell out and making great, grass-roots, inspiring music that has gone underground and yet still reaches out to us little guys everywhere.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I became aware of the work of At the Drive-In after I heard the album \\"Frances the Mute\\" by The Mars Volta, one of the bands that derived from At the Drive-In. Upon hearing \\"Relationship of Command\\" the first time, I thought I was in front of one-more-of-those-neo-punk-albums out there, but then I sat back and listened to it a few more times and realized too that this album came in late 2000, before the neo-punk movement started taking shape. It was then that the brilliance of this album started to strike me.<br /><br />The work by At the Drive-In is not for everyone, nor is The Mars Volta. Just like bands of the caliber of King Crimson, these are musicians that are in it for the art, not the fame, and as a result, they pour their hearts into their music. At the Drive-In will pose striking changes in tempo and a few challenging moments that you will need to go through in order to fully immerse yourself in the musical proposition they have to offer. The best example there is of the type of work they put together is the song \\"Enfilade\\", where they even drop in a few beats of fresh congas, right in the midst of a powerful track that brings to mind Rage Against the Machine and the likes.<br /><br />Once you listen to the album, you will be glad you did. My advice, quite simply is: get it.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The Final Cut is one of those works that reveals as much about the listener as the composer.      The album is first and foremost an intellectual and emotional journey full of angst, fear, sarcasm, and despair, and how one reacts to it is based more on one's internal makeup than one's musical ear.     The album's songs are intense and laconic, and framed by an elegant but sparse musical structure that relies more on subtle details than lush melodies to communicate the eccentric concept at the heart of the album - that the dreams of peace and tranquility people had after the end of WWII have been torn apart by the continuing greed, ambition and paranoia of world leaders.     Waters feels a sense of personal betrayal at the fraying of what he calls \\"the post-war dream\\" because he father died creating it by fighting in WWII, the war meant to end all wars.   So this is a very intimate album in the Leonard Cohen style, and one that makes unapologetic and unnervingly frank revelations of the Waters' personal and political life.      Some people say that with the other members of Pink Floyd relegated to being sessions musicians on this album, there was no one to foil sone of Waters' more eclectic tastes when The Final Cut was recorded.  But I think the absence of the others, who lack Waters' inner drive and vision, allowed Waters to create a truly distinctive work that will stand alone in the annals of rock (with perhaps only his solo album, the Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, for company).     That Waters sewed The Final Cut together with songs left over from The Wall speaks to how creative (but troubled) he was between 1978, when he began working on The Wall and Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, and 1983, when The Final Cut was released.    For example, album was initially named The Final Cut, as in the final version of an edit, because it was meant to contain new music written by Waters for the 1982 film version of The Wall.   But as the albums concept grew, Waters deftly transformed that title to refer to a failed suicide attempt by the central protagonist in his concept, as also to the idea that the 1982 Falklands war was the final cut, as in fatal stab, into the heart of the post-war dream.     The Final Cut's delicate music and literate lyrics will disappoint space rockers longing for the sonic landscapes of Wish You Were Here or the edgy menace of Animals.    Waters' oblique references to people such as war poet Rupert Brooke, and some of the imagery he conjures might also be lost on more than a few listeners.   For example, the touching song Southampton Dock loses much of its meaning if you don't realize that's the place from where the British navy departed to fight the Falklands war in 1982.     True, elements like that can make The Final Cut seem pompous, and at first listen the album sounds stilted and lacking in melody.   But no piece of music can be everything and the genuine artist chooses his place, his style, and his message, and embraces them unapologetically.  For example, an exquisite padded leather chair cannot be rustic at the same time.     The beauty of this album is that Waters doesn't try to do everything for everybody.  He takes a stand.   If The Final Cut sounds pompous it's because Waters feels he has a right to comment on the human condition and the price leaders make unwitting citizens pay in the pursuit of greatness and power.   If the album sounds stilted it's the album's song-cycle aren't designed to give listeners a comfortable, predicable ride.   Instead, the album shifts dynamics sharply between a fiery intensity and a wounded melancholy, initially alienating all but the dedicated listener.   And if The Final Cut sounds unmelodic, well, melody has never been Waters' forte.   But someone once said that music is the space between the notes, and the Final Cut illustrates this perfectly with its subtle musical texture that is the musical equivalent of blank verse.    Though David Gilmour said he couldn't abide the The Final Cut, probably because his own musical tastes are more conventional and the shabby way Waters treated him and the others Floyd members during the time the album was made, he did contribute some indelible guitar work to it.   Gilmour's few but moving guitar solos perfectly complement the searing emotions that tumble out of Waters throughout the album.  Nick Mason's under-stated behind-the-beat drumming is perfect for deliberate pace at which the Final Cut moves, and even though Rick Wright does not play on the album his absence haunts this tremulous and unsettling work (though only die-hard Floyd fans might feel that!).     Waters, and co-producers James Guthrie and Michael Kamen, who conducts the National Philharmonic Orchestra for the album and who also adds some elegant piano work to it, also extract some stellar performances from the backup musicians.    The overall sound of the album, particularly on the recently issued re-master, is also superb.     For the fullest experience The Final Cut needs to be heard with full concentration, lyrics in hand.   And it takes many listens to understand and appreciate the album.  But if you perceive you will be rewarded with a rare nugget of music that will exhilarate and enrapture, and in the end reveal something of yourself to you.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|Pocahontas was the 1995 follow up to Disney's blockbuster success of The Lion King. Although it didn't manage to even gross half of what TLK did, it managed to pull in over $141 million domestically, which is quite respectable. Many don't care for it because of its historical inaccuracies. For a while as of late, I did push it aside and thought that I no longer cared for it like I did. However, when Disney announced a 10th Anniversary 2-Disc DVD, featuring a new extended version of the film with the previously and wrongfully deleted If I Never Knew You song, I decided to get it and gained an all new appreciation for the film, its themes, and its visual beauty...an appreciation I never had at 12 when I first saw it. <br /> <br />The transfer is much better than the Gold Collection DVD, which was riddled with grain and softness. There's not a speck of grain or any other video flaws. Audio is excellent. It's kind of hard to believe Pocahontas is 10 years old. And the film finally feels complete now that If I Never Knew You has been restored into the film. <br /> <br />While not as packed as a Platinum Edition, this DVD is thankfully void of the countless games (Instead, only one game is included here.) and cheesy pop remake videos and gets down to the MEATY stuff. The two videos for the pop songs heard during the end credits ARE here, however, but they all provide nostalgic fun while looking at videos riddled with mid-90's video cliches. Nostalgic fun. Also included is a 28-minute making-of docu produced in 1995 for the Disney Channel. It also includes cliched mid-90's touches. Nostalgic fun, yet again. It's also surprisingly not completely fluffy. Also included are various featurettes on the premiere, the making of the If I Never Knew You scene, and the music, as well as an early presentation reel featuring an early demo of Colors Of The Wind, deleted scenes, and theatrical trailers. <br /> <br />For a non-Platinum disc of a more overlooked film, Disney has certainlygiven Pocahontas an awesome DVD treatment, complete with a deleted song. I definitely recommend it, and I hope Disney does something similar in 2006 for the 10th Anniversary of another cruelly overlooked classic, The Hunchback Of Notre Dame.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|Everything I hoped for and more. The last minutes of Sunshine of Your Love are a reminder of the 1968 Cream who played with and against each other at the same time. I know because I saw them in Cleveland on May 12, 1968.
B00063MBU8|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst schlock passing itself off as emo I've ever heard. This isn't emo, this isn't punk, this isn't even rock music.

And trust me kids. That's saying A LOT.
B00005MAM2|5.0|This is one of those few movies that you can truly say that there is nothing else like it. Akira achieves everything an anime fan wants. Great, lovable characters, a moving storyline, atmospheric settings, and plenty of surprises. There is, actually, little more to say about this without spoiling it for newcomers. What I can say is that this is the model for introducing either yourself or someone you know to the anime artform.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|After two lackluster DVD releases, Disney finally gave one of their most beloved and most popular films a dazzling DVD treatment for its 40th Anniversary. <br /> <br />The transfer for this movie is nothing short of breathtaking. No grain, no film flaws, nothing of the sort. Colors are vibrant, the audio is clear and crisp, and it's the best this movie's ever looked or sounded. The songs will sound nothing short of spectacular while special effects sequences will still be as magical as ever. <br /> <br />The bonus features are excellent and this DVD boasts some of the best bonuses ever for a non-Platinum Disney DVD. You have an INCREDIBLE making-of documentary that totally goes in-depth and is not at all fluffy. The short The Cat That Looked At A King is charming and a wonderful watch. The Musical Reunion and Musical Journey featurettes are both charming to watch. There's lots of footage from the world premiere, still art galleries, publicity materials, and more. <br /> <br />In addition to this DVD, Disney also released a 2-CD Special Edition soundtrack. Disc 1 boasts the most complete soundtrack album ever available. Disc 2 contains all kinds of bonus materials. The packaging and content is truly excellent. <br /> <br />I can't find any fault with this DVD or the Special Edition soundtrack. I definitely recommend both with full enthusiasm.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've ever seen, bar none.  Where it lacks slightly, however, is in originality.  The T-1000's morphing ability was obviously stolen from Bill Brasky.  We all know Brasky's semen can form into a liquid human.  Yep, he's that strong.

0895260131|2.0|I have been looking for an objective rewiew of Islam since it is having such a profoundly negative effect on conditions in the world today.  I was pleased that this book does document most of it's references so they can be checked, since I have seen some really wild \\"quotes from the Koran\\" which have no similarity to the actual text.  However, the focus of the book seems to be to convince the reader of the superiority of Christianity.  Since I am already a Christian, I didn't need that.  Some comparisons are useful to an understanding, but there are far too many in this book.  It does contain some useful information but you have to wade through a lot of anti-Musllim diatribe to get it.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I grew up with the 1939 Judy Garland film The Wizard of Oz. I still love that film, and hope to soon buy the 3-Disc Collector's Edition DVD. I love the songs, the story, Judy, the colors, the sets, everything. It's a charming slice of old Hollywood that we'll never be able to recreate. <br /> <br />In 1985, Disney didn't even attempt to. In fact, the only connection between the two movies is the fact that the magic slippers are ruby. I don't treat this as a sequel to the 1939 film. I treat it as a totally different movie. It's not all Judy Garland singing happy songs in Technicolor settings. It's darker, with the first 20 minutes featuring Dorothy nearly receiving shock therapy. Yes, everyone thinks Dorothy's nuts! However, this film is much more faithful to Baum's original books than the 1939 film was. But I still refuse to poo poo on the 1939 film for that, because as I said, it's still one of my all-time favorites. However, upon its release, Return To Oz was a box office disaster and continued to be much maligned to this day for not being the 1939 film. For many years, Disney practically pretended that they had never had anything to do with this movie. In fact, this DVD release marks the first time Disney had even had this movie in print themselves since the 1980's video/laserdisc releases, with a late 90's video and DVD release by indie video/DVD company Anchor Bay. <br /> <br />The film is a five star film for me. However, the dreadful DVD treatment knocks two stars off my rating. All we are given are the introduction and interview with Fairuza Balk from the Anchor Bay DVD. However, we are given a bit more. We are given a theatrical trailer, some TV spots, and the opening Walt Disney Pictures logo is restored, whereas it was absent on the Anchor Bay video and DVD release. However, there WERE featurettes on the making of the movie, so they would have made a nice inclusion as well. <br /> <br />The transfer is fairly clean, but it could benefit from a (very unlikely) digital restoration. Still, it's quite clean for a mid-80's film. The sound is also fairly clean. All in all, the presentation is not bad. The worst of the transfer problems occur within the first ten minutes, where you'll see the occasional artifact, speck of dirt, etc. I didn't expect much better for this DVD. <br /> <br />In conclusion, if you believe that Oz can only be as MGM told it in 1939, this movie isn't for you. However, if you're open minded to different visions of Oz, give this movie a look. The DVD isn't the all-out Special Edition that fans would like, but it sports a fairly decent presentation of the film with a few nice, if not completely satisfactory, bonus features. I'd definitely recommend this release.
0525948023|3.0|Yes, yes. It's a good book. No one is saying it isn't in line with Tolle's general view. And it's well-written. But I'm going to give some consideration to what some very intelligent people are saying about the messenger. It is important. And I can't help but notice that the reviewers writing this off are both MALE. (\\"Clowns\\"?)     I am female and I am definitely looking at this. Why? Because I know if Eckhart were female, that person would have never gotten such praise. We are trained to think of \\"God\\" as Male from toddler-hood. Yes, it leaves an impression as to who has spiritual \\"authority\\". That this  other person was saying Tolle is Sexist--no one seemed to bat an eyelash. \\"Clowns\\"? Hardly. Those entries are smart and thought-provoking commentaries. Very legitimate. And yes, they aren't exactly referring to Tolle BEFORE his big spiritual breakthrough. (Glastonbury, England is where Tolle lived back in the early 90's.) Or that \\"detachment\\" is ok in the light of morality. He's a big spiritual guy, that Tolle, so he's excused.  Right? You bet that's a typical male viewpoint.     How nonsensical!.
B000069KGM|4.0|Chicago Transit Authority is the band's debut album and remains their best work in an over 35 year recording career. At its inception, Chicago were one of the most exciting bands in popular music. Although Blood, Sweat & Tears had been riding high at this time with their brand of jazz-rock, Chicago were much more versatile, sporting top notch musicianship, stellar songwriting skills, and distinctive vocals from guitarist Terry Kath, bassist Peter Cetera, and keyboardist Robert Lamm. Although Chicago would slowly abandon their roots and ultimately become a pop band in the '80s, the band's early releases still sound amazing and their debut release is the best example of their greatness.<br /><br />The opening \\"Introduction\\" shows Chicago's versatility at the outset. One of their most dramatic tracks, the song begins as a hard rock tune lead by Kath's husky vocals and the band's snappy horn lines. As the song reaches its peak, it softens considerably into a light jazz tune before gradually building momentum and returning to its original theme. The next two tracks, \\"Does Anybody Know What Time It Is?\\" and \\"Beginnings\\", remain two of their most enduring tracks, featuring memorable melodies, excellent harmonies, and great vocals from Robert Lamm. \\"Questions 67 And 68\\" would introduce the world to Peter Cetera's soaring tenor voice which would in time become more dominant than their jazz-rock sound. Also worth noting is that Cetera's bass work is outstanding, especially on \\"Listen\\" and \\"Introduction.\\" Their percussion heavy version of \\"I'm A Man\\" blows away the original and features all three lead vocalists taking turns on the verses as well as wild soloing from Kath. Like Cetera, Kath's instrumental talents were very underrated and he steals the show on \\"Liberation\\" and \\"Poem 58.\\" The stellar horn section of Lee Loughnane, James Pankow, and Walter Parazaider are in fine form throughout, particularly on \\"South California Purples\\" and \\"Someday (August 29.1968).\\" The only misstep on the album is Kath's \\"Free Form Guitar\\", a 7-minute excursion in feedback that eventually becomes unbearable. Despite this, the performances presented here show why Chicago were truly something special. Just the fact that both classic rock and oldies stations still play several of the tracks is a tribute to the timeless material presented here.

However, I have a few problems that keep me from giving it a full 5 stars. <br /> <br />By now, we all know the story of this beautiful film. We know the songs by heart, and it doesn't need to be mentioned that this is still the only animated movie to recieve an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. However, this DVD offers THREE versions - the \\"original theatrical version\\" which is the \\"Special Edition\\" but without the Human Again song that's in the \\"Special Edition\\" and a new version of the Work-In-Progress edition, previously available only on laserdisc and VHS in the deluxe box set Disney released in 1992. If you get a chance, please watch the Work-In-Progress edition. <br /> <br />This DVD also includes a plethora of bonus features for kids and adults alike. Games for the kids, and serious behind-the-scenes materials, trailers, TV spots, galleries, etc. for the adults. <br /> <br />However, I have some gripes about the transfer - namely edge enhancement. Cramming three versions of the movie onto one disc was a bad idea. In my opinion, the Work-In-Progress edition should have been on disc two. Also, I'm not too happy with how the film has been lightened up. The film was intended to have dark, muted colors. However, despite these flaws, the movie still retains all the beauty and charm I fell in love with nearly 15 years ago. And I love the newly added song, Human Again. Now, the original theatrical version feels empty to me. <br /> <br />I'm also not too happy with how the bonus features sometimes appear in more than one spot, such as the Celine Dion music video appearing in two spots and having two versions of the making-of docu...one substantially longer, having more material, etc. It makes it look as if Disney padded this disc so it'd look like there were more bonuses than there are. <br /> <br />However, I can't NOT recommend this DVD, but that's only because I'm absolutely biased. Unfortunately, it is now out of print, and copies tend to be expensive on eBay and Amazon Marketplace. However, it's definitely worth it, especially if you can get it used for a good price, and if a disc doesn't work, call 1-800-72-DISNEY, and for a fee of about $7, you can have the discs replaced through Disney's Disc Replacement Program. <br /> <br />In conclusion, please don't hesitate to get this if you're willing to pay a good amount of money for it or if you're willing to risk buying it used. It's a gorgeous movie, and the bonus features are good. Despite my few gripes, it's worth the price.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|I bought this dvd version, because I thought it would come with a free movie ticket, but, it did not, thath sucks, I guess they decided not to have it come with a free movie ticket to see the remake, oh well, but at least the movie is good,
B0001I561E|5.0|In 2004, after about a decade out of print, Disney finally released Aladdin for the first time on the DVD format and they did a bang-up job on the whole package.    First of all, the video and audio are FLAWLESS. Colors pop out, there is absolutely no grain to be found, no artifacts, no edge enhancement, none of that crap that sometimes affect DVD transfers.    The bonus features range from the vapid and unnecessary (Music videos by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, anyone?) to the fun and fabulous (Genie's Lamp Tour) to the incredible meaty bonus features we've come to expect from a Platinum Edition release. Deleted song demos, still frame galleries, awesome games, and the super-meaty making-of docu make this DVD worth every single penny.    In conclusion, Aladdin is one of the best Disney films. Filled with awesome songs including the Oscar-winning A Whole New World and featuring memorable characters, this fabulous movie has recieved a worthy DVD treatment.    EDIT: This DVD, along with the sequels, are now locked away in the Disney vault as of January 31, 2008, so if you've hesitated to pick it up, do so while you still can!
B0007GADZO|3.0|I'm a loyal Vai fan, so I always buy his new releases, no matter what.  This album follows the pattern of the last few discs: a handful of great instrumentals, plus 5-6 \\"songs.\\"  I tend to fast-forward through his lyrics, until I hit the solos. <br /> <br />If there is a God, I wish he'd tell Steve to stop singing.   I love the guy, and he's got a decent voice.  But damn, those lyrics are ridiculous.   <br /> <br />On a positive note, his compositional skills continue to astound.
B0000640VM|3.0|During the 80's, the studio hit an artistic, creative, and commercial slump. However, I still find that I quite enjoy Disney's 80's films, many of which experimented with computer animation, non-musical storylines, and different source materials. One of my favorite pre-Little Mermaid 80's Disney films is Oliver and Company. Boasting a soundtrack filled with great songs and a wonderful cast of characters, Oliver and Company finally gets the DVD treatment, albeit a less-than-stellar one. <br /> <br />For one, the transfer is good, but it could be much better and it has a fair amount of grain. <br /> <br />The bonus features could have been much better as well. A few fluff EPK-type featurettes, which are nice, but still fluffy, are sadly enough the meat of the bonuses. Also included, fortunately, are the original trailer, original TV spot, and the 1995 re-release trailer. Two sing-alongs are included as well as two classic Disney short cartoons. <br /> <br />Overall, it's nice to see Oliver and Company on DVD at last. This is probably the best DVD edition Disney will give it for at least a while, so if you're considering picking it up, go for it.
0307276902|5.0|Never having endured some of the horrific realities that Frey has, I feel somewhat lacking in my abilities to understand the enormity of the consequences of his life.  I can offer this though, I have been down some of these roads and this account of that plight is so truthful it almost hurts.  Frey is truly inspirational and a true testiment to the power of the human mind over itself. <br /> <br />If you have a child, loved one or anyone you care for that has or could ever face difficult decisions involving alcholoism or drug addiction, have them read this book.  Seriously!
B000003TAL|5.0|Rarely is the type of praise that \\"Daydream Nation\\" receives deserved by ANY band.  In this rare case, it is, and then some.  Possibly the great, defining indie/experimental/art-rock/alternative record of all time, \\"Daydream Nation\\" is a ride from beginning to end and represents the zenith in a string of classic records Sonic Youth released back-to-back; a series stretching from \\"EVOL\\" to 1990's major-label breakthrough, \\"Goo\\".  Nearly every song is a mind-blower in it's own, unique way.  Forget the Arcade Fire.  Forget The Mars Volta.  Put Bright Eyes on hold for a second.  None of it can hold a candle to the destructive, fragile, violent, crude, refined power of this record.  Sonic Youth's daring masterpiece has a very obvious hand in just about all of today's left-of-center music. <br /> <br />There is not a single filler track on this album.  Although the ominous, dreary \\"Providence\\" (a collage that includes a lo-fi recording of a delicate piano melody, various shadows of distant guitar chaos, and a garbled, likely substance-induced answering machine message left by a member of fIREHOSE whose name escapes me at the moment) would seem to be there to simply take up space, this soundscape splits the album into it's two critical parts.  The confused sounds that seem to have been spawned by a tumbling, grey, chaotic sky separate the frantic, terminally rocking first half of the album, containing tracks such as \\"Silver Rocket\\" and the upbeat \\"Teen Age Riot\\", from the sprawling, spacey second half.  \\"Candle\\", possibly the album's best song, starts the show.  The duo of \\"The Wonder\\" and the slow-burning \\"Hyperstation\\" follows a few tracks later, and the album closes with the rapid-fire ranting of Kim Gordon on \\"Eliminator Jr.\\". <br /> <br />In short, buy this record.  Clear your mind of all pre-conceived notions.  Kill the lights, sit back, and perhaps turn your stereo up a bit louder than usual.  If it doesn't sink in the first time, keep trying.  I didn't buy the hypeat first.  And one day, it hit me: those indie snobs actually got one right back in 1988.
B000002W9Q|5.0|I really enjoyed the music in the film so this was a must have for me. Buy it, you'll like it, besides Patrick Swayze sings on it.
0451163516|4.0|Follette's best characters in the \\"political intrigue\\" stage of his writing career are to be found in this lightning-paced novel. Set in England in the year before the outbreak of the First World War, this story concerns an anarchist named Felix, and his efforts to assassinate a Russian Prince, who is visiting England to cement a treaty of mutual protection in the event of hostilities with Germany. The anarchist, a Russian who has endured much injustice in his life (so much, in fact, he has somehow lost the capacity to feel fear in his plummet from idealistic pacifist to hardened killer)  is no purposeless psychopath.  Though he has come to regard himself as \\"lost\\" Felix holds out hope that if the chains of tyranny can be lifted from the peoples of Europe, then peace and goodness might rise. He sees no need for governments or for law. He feels humans can best direct themselves and authority is by definition corrupt. It is to the end of disrupting the treaty between the two powers, England and Russia, that Felix travels to London in 1914, intent on stopping the alliance and making war that much less attractive to the great powers. Opposing Felix is an English Earl named Walden, who, unknown to both men, has a unlikely mutual connection with Felix from the past-the Earl's wife. This novel moves at a brisk pace and flashes through the underworld of post-Edwardian London, as well as its halls of government. Winston Churchill is a minor figure in this book, although most others, including the memorable eighteen-year-old Charlotte Walden, at the time of the novel, supposedly a ninety-two-year-old  friend of Follette's, are fictional constructs. I found this novel skillfully rendered and immensely  enjoyable. It is possibly the best of the novels Ken Follette composed before his turned out his 1989 masterpiece: The Pillars of the Earth.
0790733226|5.0|I am a fan of Jodie Foster and think that she did a great job in this film. I also am a huge fan of sci-fi, so this movie was a great combination. I would give it two thumbs up.
B000B0WODA|4.0|Franz Ferdiand isn't a band that is going to change your life but they are band that will provide some of the best foot-tapping music and make the most entertaining music out there with smiles on their faces.  You could probably say that they had a sophmore slump because they didn't churn out all of the those memorable songs like \\"This Fire\\" , \\"Come on home\\",  \\"Dark of the Matinee\\" etc instead they made some great softer songs like \\"Walk Away\\" which is probably my favorite song on the album.  This is less of a rock of an album and went in a slightly different direction which I didn't expect because I figured they would have felt pressure to make another \\"Take Me Out\\" and would take an entire trying to make a song that was just as hit worthy as that song was. They didn't, I am glad and this album is awesome.  Buy it if you wants some fun music with some swagger.

B000000OSG|5.0|After AFD and Lies, GN'R were looking to go into a different direction with their music. Actually, it was more of Axl's decision than Izzy's, Slash's, or Duff's.  <br />        When I put this album in, I was shocked at how much GN'R had changed. While \\"Civil War\\" recites a quote from the movie Cool Hand Luke, songs like \\"You Could Be Mine\\" return GN'R to the roots of rock n' roll. Use Your Illusion II is one of the greatest albums I own, and is probably my favorite GN'R album. Even though I could live without \\"My World\\", the rap song Axl added at the last second, I still love this album.  <br /> <br />Here's a quick rundown of the songs. <br />1) Civil War 10/10. One of the greastest Guns N' Roses songs I've ever heard. From the beginning till end, I was headbanging.  <br />2) 14 Years 8/10. Good song, but not GN'R's greatest. Still, its a fun song to listen to. <br />3) Yesterdays 9/10. Good song. Not only does the piano enhance it, but the opening solo is great. <br />4) Knockin' on Heaven's Door 10/10. One of the greatest covers GN'R has EVER done. <br />5) Get in the Ring 6/10. Filler track; vulgar; pointless. <br />6) Shotgun Blues 5/10. Never liked this song, never will. <br />7) Breakdown 10/10. A great intro, which includes a banjo. Can't believe they never played it live. <br />8) Pretty Tied Up 8/10. Cool intro, sounds sorta Egyptian with the sintar. <br />9) Locomotive 9/10. Great song, but seems a little repeatitive near the end. <br />10) So Fine 6/10. Never sing again Duff. <br />11) Estranged 1,000,000/10. One of, or THE, greatest song GN'R has ever recorded. I absolutley love the mood changes, piano, and Slash's rockin' guitar solos. <br />12) You Could Be Mine 9/10. The return to Appetite. A great rock song. Brings the band back to their roots. <br />13) Don't Cry (Alt. Lyrics) 7/10. A good song, but I still love the original version.  <br />14) My World -100/10. Axl... what the hell were you thinking?! Rap and rock do not mix. I refuse toconsider this a GN'R song since its just Axl, a drum machine, and some other girl. Absolutley terrible.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Listening to American Idiot is like having a dazzling fireworks display going off in front of your eyes.  It's bright and brash and the best thing to happen to music in a very long time.  I gave up listening to radio in the 90's for all the homogenized pop crap and/or \\"hits\\" of the 80's that were all that I could  find there (limited selection, having moved from metropolitan to rural area- I never knew of Green Day until they \\"mainstreamed\\" here with the editted version of Blvd of Broken Dreams; vh1's Storytellers gave me the chance to find out how great the rest of American Idiot is.)  Anyway, as a self-styled punk diva who came of age listening to Blondie, Patti Smith, the Pretenders, & the Ramones, you can imagine how blue this could cause a girl to be!  But Green Day has pulled me out of my funk and made it clear that someone, somewhere still has the ability to put together a punk-pop masterpiece.  Every song on the disc is great, not one throw-away in the bunch.  How often does that happen?!   AI has been on my stereo in my house & car every day since before 10.12.05 and I've yet to grow tired of it...in fact, it gets better the more I hear it!  And for the doubtful, \\"Whatsername\\" will grow on you- when that wall of drums & guitars crashes in around the vocals, isn't that what it feels like inside when some fragmented yearnings from a shattered yesterday suddenly pop up? Think about it.
B000B0WODA|4.0|what surprises me most about franz ferdinand's sophomore album is the sheer rapidity with which it was released.  these days most decent bands go three years between releases.  franz, on the other hand, released 'you could have it so much better' before the debut ever cooled down.<br /><br />i suppose the notion of 'striking while the iron's hot' is valid--why not capitalize on popularity while you've got it? fortunately, it's not a 'sell-out' on the band's part because they've actually got the tunes to back it up.  it would have been relatively easy to release an album of duds for the sake of releasing an album.  'you could have it so much better's' first single, 'do you want to,' is vaguely similar to 'take me out'--complete with intro, stop/start dynamics and of course, the KILLER hook.  i suppose this is what franz does best. they're not out to make an album (save that for radiohead or the flaming lips). rather franz assaults your senses with dueling guitars (the best aspect of their music, in my opinion), alex's tongue-in-cheek vocals (is he marion gold's lovechild? sounds just like him), and a relentless rhythm section. forget 'concept' albums, forget about 'themes' and 'cohesion.' it's all about the three-minute pop song, and they do it *amazingly* well.  you'd be hard pressed not to hop off the couch and relive the college days when clubbing was actually fun.<br /><br />thankfully they've also expanded their sound. 'eleanor, put your boots back on' is quite a different franz song, yet it's still a franz song.  the opener, 'the fallen' is perhaps the album's finest moment. it's the proverbial blitzkrieg, encompassing all the best parts of the franz repetoir (especially the frantic, dueling guitars). 'walk away' is another stand out track, as we actually hear a little acoustic guitar.<br /><br />my gripe with 'you could have it...' is that it's about 3-4 songs too long. i can't fault the band, entirely, for it's evident they absolutely LOVE what they do (if you have a chance to see them live, go! it's well worth the price of admission. these guys SHRED on the guitar). having said that, sometimes less is more and 'you could have it so much better' would be so much better if it were a tad shorter.<br /><br />in short, it's not as immediately engaging as their first album; however, it's still got 1/2 dozen GREAT songs. and any album with 6 GREAT songs, is a worthy album indeed.them live, go! it's well worth the price of admission. these guys SHRED on the guitar). having said that, sometimes less is more and 'you could have it so much better' would be so much better if it were a tad shorter.     in short, it's not as immediately engaging as their first album; however, it's still got 1/2 dozen GREAT songs. and any album with 6 GREAT songs, is a worthy album indeed.
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Alright, the moment all Priest fans have been waiting for...Judas Priest reunited in full metal form! The return of the Metal God himself, Rob Halford had many fans eagerly salivating at the mere thought of a new Priest album. Although I am a big fan of the \\"Ripper\\" Owens era, I too was quite excited to hear what the boys had in mind. 1990s Painkiller was the climax of the Judas Priest catelog...leaving little room for improvement which led to Halford's departure...(as well as many differences between he and his bandmates). Fastfoward 15 years later, the beast known as Judas Priest give us Angel of Retribution. A collection of songs varying in style and form dating all the way back to their second release Sad Wings of Destiny. It almost seems as if they purposely wrote each song with each previously released album in mind. Deal With The Devil is in the form of Hell Bent For Leather and British Steel, Revolution sounds like something from Defenders or Turbo, Demonizer is unmistakingly Painkiller (more so like Jugulator...oooohhhh how dare I compare a Halford release to a Ripper Owens/post-Halford release...well, too bad....I JUST DID...), and Angel is so close to Sad Wings of Destiny and Stained class' Beyond The Realms of Death....it's chilling. Eulogy (the weakest track on the cd) is Sad Wings style too...and it takes us to the last track, Lochness. Lochness is a heavy riff (almost like Dio's Egypt), with a VERY annoying chorus melody and 10 times annoying lyrics. One would have to hear it to understand what I am talking about. <br />So, overall, Angel of Retribution is a really good comeback album considering the amount of pressure they must have been under from their record company. A band as legendary as the Priest, reunites with great anticipation from the Metal industry all over the world and that spells reunion tour, Album and world tour. That's a lot to deal with. I really think this is a good warm up for what's to come next.... I think the next album will be a 5 star release. <br />Why did I give it 4 instead of 5? Well, if Angel, Eulogy and Lochness would have been stronger tracks, it would have been 5 stars. But to be perfectly honest, they are not as strong as those I mentined earlier...not even close. The other thing that is quite annoying about this album is the way the drums are mixed. Scott Travis IS the strength behind Judas Priest. Sure Glenn and K.K. are the perfect example of classic riffs, and Rob's voice is what defines the Priest sound...but, listen to the albums before Scott joined and what you will hear are great songs, great riffs, but very substandard drumming. I will give a lot of credit to the drummer that Scott replaced, Dave Holland. At times, he came pretty close to hitting the spot just right, but Scott has been hitting it over and over and over since he joined. Overall, it's good Heavy Metal by one of the mightiest figures in Metal. It's good to hear and see Metal alive and well.
B000002KHH|5.0|Although this album receives much more recognition than its predecessor, it is equal in quality and both are a must in any collection of music. Each song is excellent, although others are classics. War Pigs does not get the recognition it deserves, although the melody drives this song in the first half more than the guitar. Paranoid is a metal  classic. Although little more than 4 chords and a solo, this song has set the standard for speed metal, and is addictive. Planet Caravan is not one of the standout tracks, but on most other albums it would be. Iron Man. Iron Man Iron Man Iron Man. The most overrated song on the album, but still a great song. The riff is excellent, but that's the only thing the song is memorable for. Face it. Still a great song. Electric Funeral is a slightly slower track and has a slightly eerie overtone. Worth listening to. Hand of Doom is probably my least favorite song on the album, but is still better than any other metal band could do (such as Korn). Rat Salad is one of Sabbath's best instrumentals (my favorite is Embryo before Children of the Grave). And the closer. Fairies Wear Boots. Basically Tony Iommi jamming with some lyrics added. The outro riff is probably the best on the album, and the entire song has a very catchy tune.  (And if you want a REALLY catchy riff, listen to Dirty Women on the album Technical Ecstacy). All in all, ties for first with Black Sabbath for the band's best album. Excellent in all areas, and a must for anyone listens to music.

B00013AXEE|2.0|I am not criticising Stephen King for the sake of it; I enjoy his books, around a dozen of them are on my list of all time favorites. But as a writer, I must caution aspiring writers about some of the advice King gives in this book. He describes his forumla for drafting as a first draft, second draft, and a third which is essentially a 'polish'. He also disparages plotting, going as far as calling writers who plot mediocre. This is a bum steer; there are many great books written using this method. Also key is the careful, almost obsessive redrafting, going over one's work with a fine-tooth comb, pure elbow grease. There is not enough emphesis on that part of the job, and King is one of the only writers I have ever read who neglect to emphasise the importance of careful and laborious revision.    If you are a King fan, you will enjoy the insight into King's life and work, told in entertaining style as we've come to expect. But if you are a serious aspiring writer, look elsewhere for advice on the craft. King is not a help to you here, and maybe King didn't realize what was at stake by giving bad adive ... a young writer could waste years going about the job in the wrong way.
0743201140|3.0|This book begins to scratch the surface of your place in the working world.  It's a good book for those in the professional/doctoral ranks to evaluate and a risk for most to get useful results.   <br /> <br />The usefulness of the book is totally based on your taking a one-time-only on-line evaluation based on a code on the inside coverslip of the book.  If that evaluation fails in some regard, you'll be lost with no confidence in the results.  The book comes across as chintzy, with no foresight in these cases.  <br /> <br />The first recommendation, then, if you do use the book, is to take the evaluation, immediately, based on the instructions in CH 4.  If you feel that it didn't go well for whatever reason, return the book (or throw in the trash) if you had planned to get personal help with it -- it won't be possible any longer. <br /> <br />Again, the book does present ideas which professionals in human resources, psychology, or school systems may find useful.  Some of these professional readers may find the ideas useful to sift into their own ideas on how to discover your strengths.

But he doesn't reign in the mannered technique enough for you to relax and enjoy the story.

006016848X|4.0|Before writing this review, I spent some time looking over many of the other reviews on here.  The spread is interesting, and I think it comes from a misunderstanding of the very limited scope of this book.<br /><br />First off, if you're looking for a book to explain the innate differences (if there are any?) between men and women, this is definitely not it.  Further, if you're looking for a book that dives deep into communication theory and has profound statements regarding the nature of good communication, this is equally lacking.  The title betrays the purpose.  This book is a badly written collection of common sense ideas and tactics to use when communicating in a relationship.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?  Because common sense is not as common as people think.  I am amazed at the 1-star ratings by \\"intellectuals\\" who charge that this book stands on very shaky philosophic ground, and that it does not live up to the high caliber of true scientific studies into communication fundamentals and/or gender differences.  Get a grip!  That's not the purpose of the book!<br /><br />This book is equivalent to an \\"Idiot's Guide to Listening, Respect, and Communication, with Easy-to-Remember Examples.\\"  Intellectuals charging that the common person should read XYZ's scientific study about the fundamentals is missing the basic point -- I don't want to know the fundamentals of communication (at the moment), I just want to know why my last girlfriend got offended when I offered solutions when she was complaining about work.  Sounds simple?  Not for all of us.<br /><br />I have a degree in rocket engineering and I am very confident that I could tear a book about \\"Physics for the common person\\" to ribbons for making vast over-generalizations and ignoring (what I consider to be) key details in the trade.  I could easily humble half the readers of this review if we were talking about rocket dynamics.  But would I criticize a beginner's physics book if it generates interest in my favorite subject? Of course not! You can't mock a beginner's book for not addressing the advanced issues.<br /><br />Further, it is hard to argue with the couples who say their marriage has been saved by this book.  All idealism and charges of misogynistic text aside - if it works, it works.  Period.<br /><br />I find it kind of humorous that those most offended by the generalizations made in this book are the ones most quickly to generalize.  You must remember: Not all stereotypes are false, or even bad.  When I go to China and sit down at a restaurant, I'm going to ask for chopsticks, and not forks.  Why?  Because I stereotype all people in China as eating with chopsticks.  Is this bad, or just efficient?<br /><br />Many men and women fall into the stereotypes as described in this book.  Whether or not you agree with those stereotypes as being \\"right\\" or \\"acceptable\\" is really irrelevant to the point.  Further, the stereotypes are just a method of conveying the information.  Gray is just trying to document the two different most common reactions to stress, and labels them \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" according to stereotype.  He might as well have labeled them \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" for all I care -- the point is not the male/female generalizations, the point is understanding BOTH ways of dealing with stress (talking about it or receding into thought) and how to correctly handle it when you or your partner starts doing either.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, let's get off the charges of women-hating.  The book is almost literally a mirror within itself, as every paragraph generalizing women has its counterpart generalizing men.  While you can charge that he mislabels both equally, those who look at this evenly stacked book and somehow derive a women-bashing lean are simply playing up their own insecurities, opinions, and political stances regarding the genders.  The book is an almost word-for-word split between the two (if you don't believe me, go back and look!).  If youcan only see the women-bashing side of things, while nonchalantly accepting all the male generalizations, then you are reading through your own mental filter, and should take a moment to consider that.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those of you who may not have the common sense that the elitist intellectuals profess, nor the ludicrous sensitivity to one side of an equally balanced portrayal of (admittedly overgeneralized) gender roles.back and look!).

B0006L16N8|1.0|This album was completely unacceptable.    I am a huge fan of Coldplay, and I have been for years. I've listened to them since their \\"Yellow\\" days. However, even being as big a fan as I am, I cannot say that this album was worth a tenth of what I paid for it.    The lyrics are absolute drivel. Chris Martin has never been any Bob Dylan, but this disc is chock-full of lyrics like (and I'm not kidding. This is from \\"Twisted Logic\\".):    \\"You'll go backwards,   but then,   you'll go forwards,   again.\\"    This lyric is not only a ripoff of a line from Radiohead's \\"Electioneering\\", but it also has no aesthetic value whatsoever.    Lyrics aside, we have to look at the actual music involved. Chris Martin has cited that the album was heavily influenced by a number of artists, and boy does it show. Not only does this hodge-podge mix of \\"songs\\" reek of unoriginality, but Coldplay has lost that unique sound that has made them unique in this MTV-dominated national music scene filled with bands like Fall Out Boy and Pussycat Dolls.    There are two songs on this album of even the vaguest value: \\"Fix You\\" and \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\". \\"Fix You\\" is a requisite recall of the vibe that \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" had, and \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" was written for a planned duet between the band and Johnny Cash, with a sound that recalls \\"Ring of Fire\\". So, even the mindset of the two decent songs are lifted from other songs, whether it be Johnny Cash's or their own.    What it comes down to is that if you like contrived sometimes-ambient disco-rock that sounds like it's being done by a cover band, then \\"X&Y\\" is the album for you.    If not, don't waste your time.
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir's The Six Wives of Henry VIII is quite possibly one of most engaging books I've read dealing with Tudor history. I'm no expert on the Tudor period, but I know enough to realize that Weir did her fair share of research. In the past I had mainly concentrated on reading about Anne Boleyn(she being the most famous of Henry's wives), and had not taken the time to study the other wives. This book endeared me very much to Catherine of Aragon and Kathryn Howard; it was an excellent experience. <br /> <br />Weir's text is written in such a way that it can be understood by someone who is a beginner in Tudor history, thus making it very accessible in a way that other writers sometimes are not. For instance, David Starkey's text on Henry's six wives is an excellent source of information, but I find his writing style a bit stuffy(no offense to any Starkey fans).  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone. Read it--you don't know what you're missing!

B000AYEIZY|4.0|I was taken aback at first by how much they have aged.  They are NOT young men anymore, by ANY stretch.  But then I realized that I am significantly older than I was when I first heard Cream (I was only 2 years old when they disbanded in 1968) so what did I expect?<br /><br />It took about 2 or 3 songs for me to get past how frail Ginger looks and to stop daydreaming about them getting around on walkers and eventually dying.  Then I started listening to the music.<br /><br />Jack Bruce is still a very expressive singer.  He may not have the blues-y voice Clapton has but he is far more interesting to listen to.<br /><br />The last time I had seen Cream onstage was at the 1993 R-n-R Hall of Fame induction ceremony, which aired on VH1.  They played a version of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" which will NEVER be topped.  Ever.  Guess I was expecting more of the same here.  On this DVD they aren't really on fire but they are a very tight and solid power trio and deserve every accolade they get for this series of shows.<br /><br />[...]I met Steve Howe in 1986 and to see him now I thought he had aged 49 years instead of 19.  One stiff breeze in Howe's direction and the guy will probably hit the dirt.<br /><br />As for this Cream DVD, I see no reason why this could not have all fit onto one disc.  No reason at all.  Maybe there is something \\"eventful\\" about it being a 2-disc set  ---  makes it seem like there is more value for your money, I guess.  Marketing people sure have us figured out, don't they?<br /><br />Good DVD.  Buy it.  But prepare yourself for how Father Time has intruded on your mental images of how Cream looks in your memories.
0743442539|4.0|This is just a great, solid, easy to read and dramatic spy thriller.  Won't change your life, but is perfect for a long airplane ride.  Definitely not trite fluff like so many other spy novels.  This one rings true and has that authentic feel to it.  Very well written.
B000002J3W|5.0|I orginally had the casette version about three years ago, but i gave it away, i regret that choice if this cd came out maybe three years earlier it would have been on par with vulgar display of power or painkiller. I recommend this for any fan of true straight up hard rock metal music, this is a classic. <br /> <br />Tom
B000B8I8X2|2.0|There are a few good songs on this cd.  I figured i was going to like the King Diamond track \\"Into the Fire\\" because I am such a big fan, but it wasn't that good.   <br />And Trivium sucks... They shouldn't have been allowed to be part of this.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|When i purchased this album, and actually heard the root of all evil on the radio, believe it or not before this record came out, I was expecting a follow up on par with Train of Thought which i probably enjoyed most of their albums, it was definitely heavy. Well on the plus side of this album the titled track was almost a pink floyd cover, but you knew it was dt about the middle of the song, Panic Attack and Never Enough were very strong names and familar DT standards. These Walls was straining to listen too, I walk beside you was probably the worst song i have heard from a major label band. I would say this is the not record you want to look at if your new to the band, but buy it anyway, start with scenes  from a memory or awake i would say to start. <br /> <br />Tom
B000B8I8X2|5.0|Now obviously Roadrunner records if you were to look at it from start to finish is a rock/metal label no matter what. Yes in the past 10 or so years they have signed some \\"mellow\\" acts but they never forgot their roots. Which brings me to Roadrunner United.  <br /> <br />I've been looking forward to hearing the complete album since they announced the line up of people who would be collaborating on this simply awesome outing. What I like about it is the fact that it bounces all over the place. Never stops to be \\"one\\" thing. You start off with a metal song and then a few songs in you are treated to a crazy death/grind track. Mean while as you continue the musical journey through the cd you have various styles come up but they are all AWESOME.  <br /> <br />I give this CD 5 out of 5 stars because Roadrunner had the determination and means to create something like this. Now if only century media records would do the same...... <br />
0321213351|2.0|This is a very good reference/utility book for any software designer, developer, maintainer...  Unlike the traditional design pattern books, which talk about how to apply various design patterns under various situations, this book focus more on how to find badly designed and implemented code and apply simple yet effective patterns to make the existing code better.  The author starts with listing some common problems in the existing code, such as conditonal complexity, long method, etc.  He goes on by suggesting some possible solutions to the problems, such as using a strategy pattern to reduce conditional complexity, etc.  He uses some very good examples and shows the detail steps involving in the refactoring process. <br /> <br />This book deserves \\"*****\\" if the complete source code before and after refactoring is available.  Without the complete source code, it takes much more time and effort in trying to understand what is involved in the refactoring process.

B0000VAFO0|5.0|Ok, so notwithstanding Kate Beckinsale, who happens to BE the entire movie...the storyline was pretty decent, too.  I'm a horror purist and don't usually go for bastardized, hybrid versions of the  Matrix meets Blade Runner, but I loved Underworld!  What's not to like - old world, medieval Budapest shot through a dark filter gives the overall feel of the movie something straight out of Nosferatu.  Loved the soundtrack too.  Loved everything about this movie, in fact, except - Note to wardrobe:  Assuming Len Wiseman can pull himself off his bride long enough to film Underworld II, can you please *not* raid Hellraiser's Cenobites' or Dark City's The Strangers closets!!  Get your *own* look, please!<br /><br />Lastly, to the people who \\"laughed\\" through the entire movie and wrote a review to emphasize to everyone else how very sophisticated you are- get a grip.  Underworld is, after all, just a movie.  Another Hollywood creation that couldn't *possibly* live up to your oh-so-dark & mysterious-life.  No one is going to try to stop you from painting your fingertips black or wearing black lipstick.  Carry on, freaks.  Nothing more to see here.
0894803123|4.0|I liked the Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream book.  The instructions were easy and the ice cream was very good.  I also liked the history section where Ben and Jerry tell how they started their business.  My only disappointment was the lack of a real vanilla bean ice cream.  I can't wait to try many of the exciting flavors of ice cream and frozen desserts.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I had previously seen the movie, and I love it! It's one of my favorite movies. I was so happy that I could get it for myself for less than 20 dollars on Amazon! I recommend this movie because it's a wonderful story, with beautiful music and a really cute, misunderstood man in a cape. I am a hardcore Phangirl! While occaisionally Gerard Butler's brash singing style gets on my nerves, it does make him much more sinister and angry-at-the-world. It is such a captivating story. I watch it obsessively!
B000068PQ0|5.0|An electronic/acoustic sound-clash experiment for the enigmatic art-house Oklahomans, which resulted in their most anthemic and (gulp) focused LP to date. Fight Test and the heavenly Do You Realize? raised the profile of one of the music world's real maverick artists. <br />The robots vs. humanity theme prevails throughout, elevating Yoshimi... to the status of full-blown concept album, albeit a far more accessible one than 1997's four disc (to be played simultaneously) set Zaireeka. A modern classic.     <br />
B00005NGAL|5.0|Back in the 80's I saw this musical live on stage and it has stuck with me for all these years...twenty-one years to be exact!  When it was first released on VHS, I received a copy as a gift, but I must say the DVD with all the extra bonus material far exceeds the VHS.  And it wasn't until I received the DVD that I parted with my tape.  I handed it down to my godson, Jayden, who just turned two and LOVES it! <br /> <br />Elaine Paige is awesome and performs with overwhelming emotion. <br /> <br />I highly recommend CAT'S to everyone, no matter what age and even if you don't like cats.  I'm a dog lover myself!
B000002TWN|4.0|Virginia born Michael D'Angelo Archer re-mapped the stagnant '90s R&B/soul scene with this stunning 1995 debut. A whole host of others followed in wake of this and Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite to create the `nu-soul' movement. Key tracks are the title song's smokey piano bar ode to Mary Jane, the swinging When We Get By, and the violent, blues-style narrative Sh*t, Damn, Motherf*cker; a response to a lover's infidelity. Not quite as well executed as 2000's follow-up Voodoo, but a landmark in any case. When the third album from one of America's least prolific - but most talented and visionary - artists will emerge is anyone's guess. However, these two slabs of classic soul have established an enviable legacy already.     <br />
B000AJJNPY|3.0|Not to take away anything from the music, but anyone with minimal marketing knowledge knows you do NOT go outside the industry defined parameters as far a packaging goes. The Takk CD case is too large to fit in any storage for standard CD Jewel cases rendering it useless to be put in a library. This also means some retailers will not display it alongside other CDs and will be hidden away. Hopefully The label will have enough common sense to re-release it in a standard jewel case.
B000AA4LAK|5.0|i love the killers! they are the best band out today and screw what everyone says about them being mtv darlings. theyre a great band, of course theyre gonna get airplay. anyone who doesnt like this band and their music needs to take a self-examination and realize that they probably like arcade fire and pitchforkmedia and want to be cool hipsters.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Unlike its predecessor, \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 1,\\" which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, \\"Kill Bill, Vol. 2\\" is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man`s thriller in its climactic scene.  This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiance and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding.  Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him.  But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.<br /><br />The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today.  Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic.  Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.<br /><br />Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role.  She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth.  It is here where the \\"Kill Bill\\" saga finally becomes a work of art.  As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first.  But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal \\"Pulp Fiction\\" from ten years earlier.e another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth.

B00000K44W|4.0|This CD came out about 1977 and in my opinion shows Jethro Tull during the period where they did their very best work. <br />I love Jethro Tull when they are using Mandolins, acoustic guitars. and Glockenspiels. I love Tull's acoustic side and there are a few songs that in my opinion are among his very best. <br />The first would be \\"Acres Wild\\". another would be \\"Moths\\", moths reminds me of Songs from the Wood, and finally \\"One Brown Mouse which has been a personal favorite of mine since the album was released. <br />Heavy Horses is among my top five favorite Tull songs. <br />I love the way Ian Anderson moves from electric guitar and to acoustic and back and forth. These are some of Martin Barre's finest lead runs ever. This could be Martin Barre' finest hour. <br />The Acoustic guitar on Heavy Horses could be his finest was well. <br />This is among Jethro Tull's finest albums ever. No collection is complete without it
B0000B1OFL|2.0|Shallow characters, uninspired directing, a lackluster screenplay, and tasteless \\"hollywood\\" music make this shameful wannabe of Ocean's Eleven a huge waste of considerable talent and resources. A great cast is relegated to sketchily developed characters that barely transcend the status of \\"stock\\". A great deal of potential depth and intrigue is lost by making Edward Norton's villain not only conspicuously absent from much of the film, but also by depriving him of any interesting persona whatsoever. Even Ed Norton, coerced into working on this questionable film, could not bring anything worthwhile to the role. or maybe he didn't care to. The music oscillates awkwardly between blatant ripoffs of the sly double-bass/breakbeat grooves used by Soderberg, and the most tasteless and unoriginal of grandiose film scorms, piling huge string-section crescendos and mind-numbing pounding of drums into chase scenes that are already chaotic enough.    Artistically speaking, this is a terrible film, practically a catalog of all that is wrong with big-budget Hollywood fare. However, like most bad Hollywood movies, as a no-brainer two hours of visceral entertainment the film succeeds. Caper/heist films are inherently enjoyable for me, and some funny supporting character interplay and spectacular location work make it a decent action film. But shutting down Sunset Blvd or shooting a boat chase in Venice doesn't bring life or depth to a film, and when the film leaves the action to work on the story or characters, it's the same uninspired nonsense that is in every movie of this type. As an action film on its own merits, I would have given this 3 or 4 stars, but I was so horribly dissapointed by the waste of acting talent and general lack of taste that i can't really \\"reccommend\\" this film. Mos Def, in an inconsequential supporting role, is probably the most interesting person to watch in the film, which doesn't say much for the leads of Theron, Marky Mark, and Norton, all of whom turnin wooden performances as the most predictable of recycled, mechanically-motivated characters. Like I said, i wouldn't care if this was just another hollywood mashup, but there's so much talent wasted.

0061015725|3.0|As a great Crichton fan, I was looking forward to this new novel (as I much as I am looking forward to the one coming out in November). It seemed so very much on the pulse of the newest and hippest technology today : nanotechnology. It seemed as promising and \\"fresh\\" as Timeline. Unfortunately... it turned out not to keep any of those promises. <br />First, it takes half to book to get actually thrilling and tense. We spend too much time in the family life of the characters. Then the suspence starts and pick up slowly. By the time they hit the cave, there are only a few pages left and you wish the book would have been longer. <br />So all in all, OK but could do a whole lot better.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|And not just a great Batman movie but a great film! I was in awe at how fantastic this movie was that I saw it twice in IMAX! The acting, direction, pacing, f/x, set design, etc. . . . all top notch.  <br /> <br />The film is an \\"action film\\" but also very thought-provoking and inspiring. The world of \\"Batman Begins\\" is so real and believable, yet fantastical enough to sweep you away. Comical at times, yet frighteningly horrific at times. Lots of twists and turns with plenty of characters for all kinds of sub-plots. I'm amazed they packed it with so much and still kept it moving right along. I'm curious to see an \\"extended cut\\" should one ever become available. Pay attention to the little details for some \\"answers\\" to lingering questions. <br /> <br />Looked and sounded awesome on the big screen; I expect it to hold up well on a nice DVD home theater set-up. So, if you haven't seen it yet, see it! Just make sure it is not on a tiny TV or laptop, etc.   <br /> <br />I can't imagine how a sequel to this film could compete as this was one tough act to follow. I did read a few negative reviews on here and quite frankly, I have to shake my head at those. I'm a tough critic myself that typically loathes Hollywood garbage but how could you not think this movie is AT LEAST pretty decent? Did we see the same film?! Anyway, 95% of the reviews all over the world about this film are very positive so that should speak volumes. <br /> <br />Batman - ok, decent <br />Batman Returns - not very good <br />Batman Forver - barely passable <br />Batman and Robin - awful, unwatchable <br />Batman Begins - INCREDIBLE! <br /> <br />Kudos to the cast and crew of BATMAN BEGINS!
B000B0WODA|4.0|I have been waiting for this album to come out since I heard about the follow up to Franz Ferdinand's wonderful self-titled debut.  The Scottish quad first took the music world by storm in early 2004 with their single, \\"Take Me Out.\\"  While this was the only song off the first album to be released as a single in the states it did very well, reaching number three on the Billboard charts, garnering the group three Grammy nominations, and praise from some of music's biggest names, including this quote from Bono, \\"Franz Ferdinand is going to take over the world.\\" Not bad for a band that started with only one goal in mind:  Make girls dance.  <br />And they succeeded in that.  It is very hard to put the group into a genre because they have such an unique, fresh sound.  Because of this the new genre dance-punk was created especially for them, however, I think that as soon as the public gets a hold of the new album, they will again have to do a little genre-bending to fit Franz Ferdinand into a mold.   <br />When I received my copy of the new LP, You Could Have It So Much Better With...Franz Ferdinand, I was a little scared.  I liked the first album so much, I didn't want to be disappointed in their sophomore effort like I was with so many acts this year (Weezer, Ryan Cabrera, the White Stripes, even British wonder's Coldplay).  But as soon as I began listening it was evident, this was not to be the case with Franz Ferdinand.  I will admit, it took me a while to warm up to all of the tracks, but after a few listens I really do appreciate every song on the album.  There is no filler, it's all single worthy.   <br />One of the early highlights of the album is the ballad, \\"Eleanor, Get Your Boots On.\\"  I wasn't sure I had put in the right CD at first, I honestly had to check, because when I heard this song it was like the ghost of John Lennon had infiltrated my stereo.  Now, I would be the last person to compare the lackluster music of today to the Beatles, but in \\"Eleanor\\" lead singer's Alex Kapranos' voice, mixed with the scale-sliding guitar of Nick McCarthy and easy piano piece, it really does sound like some of the stuff from the middle of the Beatle's career.  It gave me the chills. <br />Another one of the tracks that I took a quick liking to was \\"The Fallen.\\"  This is the one song that stays true to their earlier established sound, and was a highlight of their live show might I add.  Those with quick ears will be able to pick out the Christ-like storyline from Alex's lightening fast nonsense lyrics.  It also features a nifty guitar riff from Nick, which is a rarity from this Ramones inspired band. <br />The second track on \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" is \\"Do You Want To,\\" which also happens to be the lead-off single.  It sounds like bubble-gum pop with a guitar, and could very possibly be the catchiest song in the world.  I know I have found myself singing it on several occasions.  \\"Do You Want To\\" recently topped the MTV Rock Countdown, and is climbing on the Billboard charts. <br />Adding to the genre confusion is the track, \\"Evil and a Heathen.\\"  It can only be described as swing music, complete with bold drumming and a brass section, but if you listen carefully you can hear Kink's inspired dirty guitar that gives the track a depth unheard of in today's pop music. <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the most sick and twisted bands that I have ever heard. In all my years of listening to hours upon hours of Death, Grind, and Black Metal, Tool takes the cake for being the most disturbing. When I heard this album for the first time, I was blown away my the musicianship. When I listed a few more times, I began to really listen to the lyrics and take in all the between song ditties. It's dark, sick and twisted and F**ks with your mind, but it is also brillent. Tool might never reunite, but at least they left us with this masterpiece. This CD in the best of the bunch of all thier releases and I highly recommend it to those that havent heard it to listen to it and be ready to take the ride of you life
0156027321|5.0|I've been trying to figure out why this book stands out as possibly the best of the fifteen I have read this year.  Surely because it was the Booker Prize winner.  I think, in large part, it is also because this novel honors animals in an almost mythological way, not surprisingly, perhaps, because the narrator Pi is himself of the  Hindu faith, as well as being part Muslim and part Christian. \\"Life Of Pi\\" makes animals seem if anything more important in the chain of being than humans. This is a habit of thought that may have been lost in urbanized modern society, though it wasn't too many decades ago that even American farmers were dependent upon animals for transportation and for work in a way that we are now dependent upon the internal combustion engine.  There are other books that do so (possibly Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book,\\"; perhaps \\"The Lion King\\", though I don't know \\"The Lion King\\" very well; certainly American Indian  and apparently Hindu mythology.)The other novel that I have read recently that comes the closest to achieving this same effect is John Nicols' remarkable  \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\" which does so by also telling a very human story about traditional New Mexican farmers, and also, to a lesser extent, its sequel \\"Nirvana Blues\\" which has certain elements of Hindu religion--in particular monkey worship-- as part of the plot. All of the above  anthropomorphize animals in a very positive way. \\"Life Of Pi\\" does so by placing Pi on a liferaft in very close proximity with animal refugees from a zoo after a freighter sinks, and Pi, after losing his family,  also encounters numerous denizens of the sea, fish, reptile,mammal and fowl, on his 200-plus day ocean journey. In the early part of the book, Pi reflects on his early life as son of a zoo keeper in French India and the tone of respect for animals is consistent in these early sections as well, even when he describes why he believes animals are better off in zoos, than in the wild, or when hereflects on the personalities of animals.  Furthermore, Pi describes his religious beliefs in these early sections. It may have been a stroke of luck, but this book is exceptionally well written, concise and not overblown. It also includes many passages,naturally, about survival skills.
B00006JJ51|5.0|NWA meant so much to me when I first heard in back in 1989. I was never much of a fan of music that was the \\"popular genere\\" and was always looking for something more raw and powerful, no matter what kind of music it was. I was from an all white area at the time of this release, and being a white boy from the suburbs, Hip-Hop (even at this time)was still more of an urban type of music. As I was familar with some of the artist of the time, but when NWA came along, it was so powerful and raw that I thought it was the greatist thin since sliced bread. It was so damn hard and raw that I couldn't beleive what was being said. At the same time, the members of NWA had true talent, and of course most of us know that some of the members went on to be sucessful solo artist. To this day, NWA still means as much as it did went it was first released in 1988. It means more to more know because most (not all) of todays hip-hop has no feel and no energy. This is the one that put ganaster rap on the map. This one is still a treaure and hopefully it will find a new generation to listen to.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I'm a fan of horror.  Not a big one but I like being scared.  Before I watched this movie I was told \\"it's not a spoof.\\"  I didn't quite understand what that meant until about 15 minutes into it.<br /><br />It is definitely not a spoof.  It's a zombie movie.  People die in hideous fashion not in the cartoonish ways of \\"Scary Movie\\" et al.  There are also some emotional moments that harken back to the master of zombies himself; George A. Romero.<br /><br />What's the difference?  Well, the writers asked themselves how two (below) average British blokes would handle themselves in such a situation.  (Oh, and it takes place in England.)  For me the result was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a long time.
B000020617|4.0|Call me crazy, but I believe that the Foo Fighters are the best Rock band that is around today. With so much Rock music sounding bland and dull, the Foos are a treat the the musical ear. This was actually the First Foo fighter album that I picked up, as I wasn't listening to alot of Rock music when they first came out in the mid 1990's. This album, like most of the others defines Rock. David Grohl is a musical Genius, and the Foo's prove again with this album that they should remain on top for many years. ENJOY
B000B0QOJA|4.0|The Half Note set, recorded in 1965 by the classic John Coltrane Quartet, has been floating around for years as an authorized bootleg, available in the only shoddiest fidelity.  This Impulse! Recording, sanctioned by the Coltrane estate and produced by John's son Ravi, sounds wonderful.  Finally, we get to hear \\"One Down, One Up\\" in all its glory from the March 26, 1965 performance.  This performance stands right up there with \\"Out of this World,\\" \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" and \\"I Want to Talk to You\\" (the \\"Coltrane Live at Birdland\\" performance) as one of his great transitional, commanding performances.  There is an extended section in the middle of the track where Coltrane improvises with only drummer Elvin Jones accompanying him.  This looks back to the amazing \\"Countdown\\" (on \\"Giant Steps\\"), but also looks forward to similar sections of the \\"A Love Supreme\\" suite as it was played in France later in 1965 and the sax/drums duets with Rashied Ali on his swansong studio session \\"Interstellar Space.\\" <br /> <br />The other performances here are very good, but better live excursions exist elsewhere.  \\"Afro Blue\\" appears in its definitely state on \\"Coltrane Live at Birdland,\\" while the 40 minute version on \\"Live in Japan\\" is also a formidable performance.  The version of \\"Song of Praise\\" here is quite lovely.  \\"My Favorite Things,\\" as performed here, can never top its studio version, though the live version from Coltrane's last recorded concert on \\"The Olatunji Concert,\\" where he ferociously duels with Pharoah Sanders and the drumming of Ali, is much more compelling. <br /> <br />This set is highly recommended, but proceed with caution.  It is disrupted by radio announcements (by Alan Grant) which cut the songs off.  This is quite a buzzkill, to say the least.  If you can forgive this (is there a mastertape without the announcements?), \\"One Down, One Up\\" is a very high quality set for those interested in Coltrane's journey following \\"A Love Supreme.\\"
B00025ETIW|1.0|I must say that I had heard so much about this band, so I decided to give this CD a whirl. I try to listen to all kinds of music with an open mind, and even though most of my reviews are for metal, I am not some Mullet-Metal head that goes around bashing anything that isnt metal. What I am bashing is the musical talent of this band. NONE! I understand that MCR isn't a flashy rock band and try to write simple songs. It just doesn't work for me. It seems like every single song lacks any kind of emotion or feel, and MCR might just be another flash in the pan punk-rock act. If you like simple music or this genre, then stick to Nirvana, Chevelle, or even old school punk/rock like the Sex Pistols or The Clash. This one is a solid turkey, and unless they do a huge turnaround, I dont see them lasting to long in the music biz.
0380733358|5.0|I have always wanted to tell people about this superb thriller, but other things kept interfering - until now. The story has all of the elements of a first-rate novel with high stakes. During World War Two, the allied invasion of Europe will likely fail if the German army is waiting on the French coast, so the allies construct a massive, fake army pointed toward the Pas de Calais. If it misleads the Germans, the allies can invade Normandy with hope for success. But a larger-than-life, German spy, Henry (Heinrich) Faber photographs the fraud and heads toward Scotland to contact a German submarine and carry his photos to Germany. If he succeeds, the invasion will fail. But the British MI5 detects him, and the chase is on, as Faber makes his way north, killing person after person. Can the British stop him? The outcome depends on a professor, a police officer, and a young, British woman. The climax may leave you breathless. It is a tale that you should enjoy immensely.
B0000029DD|5.0|I have just purchased this CD for the first time, after remembering a friend of mine played me a song off this album many years ago. I thought I give it a whirl, remembering what an amazing voice he had, and to tell you I am only halfway through the CD and I am already blown away. Not only is Buckly's voice an instrument in itself, his backing band outstanding. Its to bad that we lost a singer with this talent, and he never really got a chance to get his musical career started. This CD is a muscial masterpiece for any music fan. Hopefully it will be passed on through the gererations as such other great artist as Hendrix, Zepplin, Yes, and Pink Floyd. ENJOY
B0007TKNCY|5.0|My husband and I can quote every funny movie we have ever watched and give each other one liners at appropriate moments.  Or inapporpriate moments as it were.  This movie has us cracking up even when were not watching it.  When ever I am looking about the house for some lost item we both shout \\"George!\\" while we look for it.   <br /> <br />Cary Grant looks wonderful without his glasses and Katherine Hepburn is a complete upper crust screwball. They have always had chemistry and it positively crackles with it.  Their comedic timing is impeccable.   <br /> <br />You have got to watch this movie.  Another good movie to get along with this is the Philadelphia Story.  Another one of my all time favorites.
B00005AQF7|5.0|When Doggystyle was first released in 1993, I don't think anyone would think that it would become the classic that it is today. Here we sit in 2005, and the album still sounds as good as it did when it was first released. Hip-Hop has taken a change for the worse over the last few years, as it has become so mainstream, that it is hard to think that there is much feel put into the CD's as there was back in the day. This is why CD's like this are a sigh of relief. We can still go back an listen to this, and remember how much hip-hop meant. Snoop does an excellent job on this album. The lyrics are first rate, and the background beats and samples are some of the best that were ever used. Its ashame what is happening to hip-hop, but we are lucky enough to have artist like Snoop that gave us this treasure to listen to today.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I LOVE this cd! The weaving of a similar theam through out all the pieces is lovely. And there is a full, bright sound quality to the whole recording. I particularly enjoy the use of the orchestra; The score successfully uses many different instruments to reach it's full potential. From soaring violins into exalting horns, and dramatic crashes of drums and cymbals.<br /><br /> My favorite tracts would have to be 2, 7, 16. However it is hard to go wrong with this cd. As was mentioned in other reviews the whole cd length is a bit short, but as the music has so many layers, it is hard to listen to just once! A definite must buy! Even if you haven't seen the movie.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Some bands can pull off writing slow, drawnout songs with whinny lyrics. Coldplay can't, as this is the most boring thing that I have ever sat through. The problem isnt that they are slow, the problem is they are slow with no musical creativity. Bands like Radiohead and Pink Floyd have made a living of creating slow, dark, and depressive music. So why does it work with them and not coldplay? Musical integrity, Different Sounds, brillent guitar work...Coldplay does none of that, and I am falling asleep more as the CD goes on...Try on something different then this yucky yukca mess
B0000026WD|5.0|This is clearly not one of MJ's best albums.  But boy is it hard hittin nonetheless.  The MJ/Teddy Riley collaborattion worked.  He comes out the gate funkin with Jam and keeps it funky all the way to track 6 Can't Let Her Get Away.  The remaining songs I bet were done mainly by MJ.  Though they are inspiring, I was expecting at least one love song.  That was a disappointment that he makes up for on future albums.  Despite his personal issues, his music skills are phenomenal.  Keep jammin!
B0006L16N8|1.0|Let me first say I liked the first two Coldplay cds. The third cd has directly ripped off their biggest hit for \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\" You probably already know that I'm speaking of the band ripping off their own harmony from 'Clocks' for 'Speed of Sound.' <br /> <br />Not only that, but their other \\"hit\\" 'Talk' directly rips it's \\"riff\\" from Kraftwerk's 'Computer Leibe.' That's no joke, these guys are hacks.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Well first to say that I like a lot these kind of first horror/suspense movies. I like Haloween I, The Exorcist, The Fog, The Shinning, Christine, The Thing and Jaws I. I have to say also that most new titles in series usualy stink. <br /> <br />Jaws is a great suspense movie and the edition is very very good. Sound, Picture, package and extras. <br /> <br />If the evolution in special effects sometimes is great (Lord of the rings as an example) most of them just permit Movie companies to make stupid films, with stupid storyboards, with ridiculous representations. <br /> <br />But go for me, this movie is before that time and so it relies on everything else, atnosphere, suspense, imagination and without compromising picture quality and sound wich are great. <br /> <br />Go for this one.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I've had the fortune of watching my friend's import awhile ago and I found the movie just okay. Decent amount of action, great graphics, but the story was kinda bland. I found myself confused and lost on some stuff, even though I was able to understand the language, what little I knew about FF7 (from what my friends talked about weeks before he got his disc in the mail) wasnt too helpful. <br /> <br />Its definitely a \\"fan service\\" material.... And because of that story lacks a little bit. Every character in the game tries to make a cameo which the fans will like, but doesnt contribute much to the overall story. Including sephiroth, just for the pure reason of having a last final fight? if you're not a fan of it you might enjoy it a little from the graphics and the fight scenes.  <br /> <br />Overall, it plays out like a typical mediocre anime thats meant for the fans.
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|This entire piece is really quite haunting after you've seen the movie. Anyone who has seen this film will recognize 'Winter: Lux Aeterna', for it is the song that plays during the downfall of every character at the end of the film. It is a chilling, beautiful piece, with sorrowful violins and easily conveys a loss of hope. <br /> <br />The rest of the music is similar. You will be truly affected if you have seen the film, but even if you have not, the scores do invoke vivid emotions and imagery. <br /> <br />For fans of the movie, or for fans of well composed scores.
B000B0WODA|3.0|Franz Ferdinand are fun.  They are bouncy, light hearted, and make me want to dance around the apartment playing air guitar.  This is what they do.  They aren't the most earnest band in the world.  They don't make grand statements about death like The Arcade Fire, or have the poetic inclinations of Wilco.  And i've learned not to expect that from these guys.   <br /> <br />You Could Have it So Much Better is the second album from Franz Ferdiand, and it's really a refinement of their first album.  Most of the songs have a similar agular feel with a catchy hook as the songs on their debut.  All the songs however seem to be very amped up.  It almost seems like streamers should be shooting out of my stereo when this album is on.  It almost borders on self parody on a few songs like This Boy and Well That Was Easy.  These songs aren't bad, they just don't seem as solid as the songs on their debut.   <br /> <br />They do slow things down a bit on a few songs Like Elenor Put Your Boots On.  They sound like they are channeling the Blur on this song, and they do a pretty good job of it.   <br /> <br />Overall, You Could Have It So Much Better is a solid second disc from the a fun indie rock band.  That may seem like an oxymoron, but these guys manage to accomplish being fun and smart at the same time.  The album is not as strong as their debut but it's still worth a listen.
0618001905|4.0|Definetely a book to read for anyone interested in colonial Africa.  The book definately helps readers learn about a period in time which most no one even knows about.  It exposes the Western world for their acceptance of slavery outside their own countries. The book is pretty interesting and is easy to keep on reading.
0440237688|4.0|My 13 year old Godson read The Giver and he was so interested, I decided to read it too.  It took about an hour, it was so compelling.  However, the ending really disappointed me!!  WAAAAY too many unanswered questions!  I am not talking about tidy resolutions, but it seems like the author got tired, and just stopped!! <br />I teach lit, and also read avidly, so have a lot to compare it to. <br />Do read it, though.  It's worth it.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Yeah the acting wasn't very good.  Other than that it was great.  The ending was definitley surprising and I loved it.  I can't wait until the sequel.  The first was great and from what I've seen of the second it will be no less.  October 28 can't come sooner.  If you haven't seen this then go rent it or buy this new edition.
B00079FUI6|5.0|The women of Wisteria Lane drew enormous interest in the media since this adult rated TV show began airing on ABC. The story revolves around Martha Stewart-perfect Bree (Marcia Cross), who has it all, until she finds out her husband is cheating on her. Gaby (Eva Longoria) is a bored trophy wife whose addiction for shopping and clothes are the perfect decoy for her affair with the hunky teenage gardener (Jesse Metcalfe). Former career woman Lynette (Felicity Huffman) is the most stereotypical housewife raising four kids and frustrated, and Susan (Teri Hatcher), the divorcee looking for love sees her prospects brighten with the arrival of hunky plumber Mike (James Denton) who has some desperate secrets of his own.<br /><br />It is a fast and wild mix of plot and characters that made this a hit show. There are 23 episodes on this DVD set, and six of the episodes can also be viewed in unrated extended versions. The DVD also includes five leading ladies' separate commentaries on few of their favorite scenes discussing the characters' clothes and homes, the show's appeal, casting decisions, the show's much-hyped secrets, and how naked Teri Hatcher had to be. There is also a segment in which talk show diva Oprah pays a visit to Wisteria Lane. If you are a fan of this soap opera your dreams are fulfilled; the DVD is out there for you to check it out.
B000A7DVR2|1.0|The only new feature on the \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD is the remastered picture and sound? The bonus features on the new DVD are already available on the DVD that is out now, excluding the remastered picture, a possibly very short 'Intro,' and the I'm sure ultra-exciting photo gallery? I'm sure the 'Making Of' feature is the same one we have already. The ONLY reason I'm even buying this one is because of the new transfer on the DVD. As for the Achiever's gift set, it should AT LEAST include a second disc full of REAL bonus features to warrant THAT price.<br /><br />For more information:<br />[...]<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Both Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline sparkle in this hilarious film featuring various vistas of beautiful France.  Watch Meg Ryan almost spoof her \\"faking it\\" scene from \\"When Harry met Sally\\" and Kevin Kline using that French accent fom \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\".  Both play their respective roles to perfection.  Additional cast includes the fabulous Frenchman Jean Reno (check him out in \\"Just Visiting\\" or \\"Crimson Rivers\\")and of course, as mentioned France.  This movie takes in parts of Paris, the countryside including vineyards, and the Cote Azure on the Mediterranean Sea. <br /> <br />Anyone who wants to spend an enjoyable evening with a movie that really is a comedic romance should check this one out.  I promise, with all the police chase scenes and slapstick comedy, even the men in your family should enjoy this film.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I never doubted that Mariah would bounce back after all of the negativity that has surrounded her career after the flop of \\"Glitter\\". Since Charmbracelet, I have to say that this is her best CD to date!!! The songs are great and it's a wonderful mix of ballads and up tempo songs too. A must have for all Mariah Fans!!!
1565117808|5.0|I did not read this book, I listened to it.  I recommend this to anyone who has the time to listen for nine CDs worth of content.  I actually have a hard time imagining reading this book as it really is designed as a story and is directed towards a listener, not a reader.  The voice talent did a fabulous job, with the main reader (there are two) portraying accents including Indian, French and Japanese.  The main character is introduced in a very lengthy manner, which some have considered a waste of time, but I found very revealing to the character and his flaws, reasonings, and manner of thought. Yan Martel vividy describes several different worlds to readers including information for all five senses allowing the readers to truly experience the story, not merely read it.  I often found the detail so specific I found it hard to believe this wasn't a true to life account. <br /> <br />The story is just what the title suggests.  It is an early life (until he is 16) biography of Piscine Patel (he was named after the finest French swimming pool).  Martel plays the biographer in this first-person account of a boy who is raised in a zoo (beware the guinea pigs), discovers that God is, no matter how you look at him, and gets stuck in a life boat with a Bengal tiger for an impressive 227 days, including a short stay on a carniverous island (think giant venus fly trap). <br /> <br />The end leaves readers wondering what to believe, but the truth of the matter is academic, as it's not true anyway, so the reader is free to believe whatever he wants.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|Excellent score.  High Drama yet so subtile.  Not for everyday listening but certinly worth hearing.  If you like Glass, Listen to his great opera Akhenaton. This is his masterpiece!
B000B5IPLK|5.0|For those who haven't had an opportunity to see Alicia Keys in concert, her new Unplugged album will give you the chance to feel what the experience is like. From the eclectic instrument play, to the blending of musical genres, this album excels in every facet of performance.    In her new Unplugged album, Keys finds ways to make even her classics like \\"Diary\\" and \\"Fallin\\" sound new and improved. Keys adds some spice to \\"Diary\\" with a catchy salsa beat, while an African beat gives \\"Fallin\\" more power than ever before. \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" comes out smoother in Unplugged, as opposed to The Diary of Alicia Keys, using a smooth Jamaican rhythm to groove to. Its impossible to listen to Unplugged and not notice the soulful voice of background singer Jermaine Paul. At times he almost steals the show, nonetheless, it is Keys who remains the center of attention.     Alicia's first two albums were great, but after hearing this live album it'll be tough to listen to those now. Her ability to interact with the crowd, and her confidence to experiment with new sounds make Unplugged the best album I've heard this year.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|Wonderful album. Great purchase, don't hesitate to buy it. I've been waiting for oct 11th just to buy it. It has all of her old hits, but never old in her sense; along with the new tracks. Definitely receives a 5 in my book.
B00004TWZF|5.0|People that  have not visited the meditteranian countries find it hard to believe that this deep blue colour of the ocean is real. Well, be sure it is. I have spent many summers on the greek islands and this is what you get. Watching this movie was as if a sea-breeze was coming through my window. The friendship depicted also of two persons that are so different is very interesting. The soundtrack too is excellent. If you have visited places like this, watching this movie will make you nostalgic. If you haven't, I am sure it will give you a strong motive to do so. I highly recommend this movie.
B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends is my favorite show of all time and I say this without any hesitation. I have seen each and every episode at least 10 times each and still I laugh my ass of everytime I watch them. They never get old. When I saw this ten season boxed set, I knew I had to get it. I mean 200 bucks, thats 20 bucks a season and just take a look at the box. Its fricken awesome lookin. Oh and I've read a lot of peoples reviews on here saying they are pissed because they already have 9 of the season and they want to get the collectors box also. To all those people, dont fricken give the product a rating of one star. The product is fricken amazing and deserves a five star rating. Besides from what I have heard, when you buy season 10 there will be an order form inside for the collectors box and you can just buy it seperately. You dont have to rebuy all your seasons. Anyway if youre a friends fan ... buy this immediately. If your not a friends fan ... buy this immediately anyway. You'll thank me later haha.
0515123447|4.0|Child's character, Jack Reacher, is the action hero for the new millennium.  Reacher is a retired Army MP Major who left the service because the downsized military after the fall of the Soviet Union left him with too small a field of play.  He spends his days now, traveling about, seeing the things he missed as a career soldier.  He gets off a Greyhound bus in the middle of Georgia to visit the birthplace of a blues musician his brother once recommended to him.  What he encounters is an almost immediate arrest for the gruesome murder of an unidentified victim.  Reacher is able to prove he wasn't even in the state at the time of the killing, and offers a tip to the sheriff about how to identify the body.  His tip was successful, but devastating to Reacher, as he learns that the body is that of his brother, a US Treasury agent on assignment.  Reacher makes finding the killers his own responsibility and leads the reader through a tale of local corruption, brutal adversaries and close calls for himself and the beautiful deputy who befriends him.  A great adventure read that mixes the technical detail of a Clancy novel with the almost superhuman capability of a James Bond type hero.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I caught the show when it was aired on tv.  Now that I got it I can sit down and watch it anytime that I want.  I love all the actors in it and I really don't think it would have been as good if the parts was played by others.  Thank you so much to Joss for making the series and for all others that he created!
0452285186|5.0|While we don't know what has brought these poor bunnies to such a lowly state, we are glad to share in witnessing their self-imposed demise.  These creative little critters find such compelling ways of doing themselves in.  We laughed and laughed as we turned each page of this book as a family, then we shared it with our friends.  Funny...  British funny, but we unsophisticated Americans enjoyed it too.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|The Corrs' latest album is a collection of Irish songs taken from their late mother's songbook--hence it was titled HOME. Unlike their previous efforts, Home is a collection of Irish songs with tinges of pop, not the other way around. 2 songs resurface again on a Corrs album, 'Haste to the Wedding'(which appeared on IN BLUE special edition) and 'Old Town' (in UNPLUGGED). Both songs in their new versions were tweaked given fresh new arrangements, with OLD TOWN being more similar to the Thin Lizzy original this time. Love odes 'Peggy Gordon' and 'Moorlough Shore' tell of love that is powerful, young set in a more earthy backdrop of instruments that never fail to soothe the ear and tame the heart.    The first single of the album 'Heart Like A Wheel' is an emotional piano piece with Andrea's sweet and heartfelt vocals, and 'Dimming of the Day' features Sharon on lead vocals--and she really owned this track. There are 2 songs sung in Gaelic. The first one, 'Buachaille on Eirne' (translated as 'Irish Boy') is just so beautiful, even though I didn't understand a word Andrea was saying, the piece was just so serene, uplifting and dreamy. The second gaelic song, 'Brid Og Ni Mhaille' also has Andrea singing acapella in the beginning of the song--definitely a highlight. It's just so nice to hear the traditional instruments full force in this album, the tin whistle, bodhran, violin--and it never gets tired.     I highly recommend this album. It just takes you to another place and time, an enchanting land that you could call Home.    TOP 5  1. Heart Like A Wheel  2. Buachaill On Eirne  3. Dimming of the Day  4. Peggy Gordon  5. Black is the Colour
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Or is that \\"every nightmare has its pieces?\\" Pardon me if I confuse this latest installment in \\"kill-people-in-grisly-ways-as-punishment-for-things-they-don't-know-about\\" cinema, since \\"Cube Zero\\" is Saw-cut from that cloth. But unlike the first two \\"Cube\\" flicks, this straight-to-DVD creep-out allows us to see the drone bees that make the machine go \\"slice.\\"<br /><br />The film opens just like the first two, with a cube inmate getting offed in a particularly gruesome manner. Then you fade back to the two jump-suited worker ants that monitor and record all the fun. One is a \\"just-following-orders\\" old fart and the other is a younger \\"what's-it-all-mean\\" puzzle-solving genius.<br /><br />Before you can say \\"that could be me in there,\\" young idealist rushes into the cube itself to try and save a potentially innocent prisoner from a fate worse than pointless sequels. Then down comes a Government over-the-top sadist wacko and his two lackeys, and soon Mr. \\"Just Following Orders\\" gets a too-late conscious and our cute female prisoner and the young know-it-all are playing beat the clock to escape.<br /><br />Fortunately, the script is plausible and no-one tries too hard to make any deep cultural significance out of all this. That means \\"Cube Zero\\" at least betters \\"Hyper-Cube\\" as much as it spools out its running time with a minimum of WTF moments (as opposed to \\"Saw.\\" Which I thought the first \\"Cube\\" writers should have been calling their lawyers over).<br /><br />But on that note, one supposes that this little cheapie will gain a cult following (along with the first two \\"Cube\\" features). And \\"Saw 2\\" will pack them in with the same kind of sadistic mayhem.<br /><br />Worth a rental.
B0009XT8YW|5.0|Barbra was never in better voice.  Still fantastic years later.
B00006LIRI|4.0|What a mixed bag this is! U2's journey through the 90's was a twisting turning ride that saw the band careening from one style to the next, trying to force themselves away from inertia and only being intermittently successful. While \\"Achtung Baby\\" is widely heralded as a masterpiece and \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was universally acclaimed for the band reclaiming their strongest attributes, I doubt many regard either \\"Zooropa\\" or \\"Pop\\" as monuments to the band's greatness.<br /><br />Which makes this best of set a true case for song. Fortunately for us, U2's songwriting was very rarely anything less than great, even if the costuming was oddball. So while the band was off exploring their musical wild hairs, they were still writing incredible material like \\"Staring At The Sun\\" or one-off's like \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me.\\" The wild hairs aren't completely gone, though. It means they had to tweak \\"Numb\\" and \\"Discotheque\\" unnecessarily. It is odd, as other reviewers have pointed out, that the remixed versions are from the weaker middle two of the four albums, while \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"ATYCLB\\" are allowed to stand in their original recordings.<br /><br />And it also means omissions abound. Conspicuous in their absence are \\"The Fly,\\" \\"Elevation,\\" \\"Walk On,\\" \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" and \\"Lemon.\\" You do get a couple of bonuses, in particular the contribution to Martin Scorsese's \\"Gangs Of New York\\" Oscar nominated \\"The Hands That Built America.\\" This collection is also worth having for what could possibly be one of the greatest songs of the 20'th Century, \\"One.\\" That song alone makes this a four star rating and saves the set from dropping to a three via all the missing material.<br /><br />As for the bonus \\"B-Sides\\" disc: frankly, not much here is really \\"bonus.\\" \\"Lemon\\" and \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" make their appearance here, but remixed (ugh). \\"Electrical Storm,\\" one of the new songs, shows up again.

B0006213WG|5.0|I still don't understand why people need to express their \\"hardcore\\" feeling by ranting online. Sum 41 is an excellent band with a top-of-the-line CD here. And I also disagree with those who say this CD is ripping off other bands. I have nearly one thousand songs, most of this punk/rock/metal type music, and they are as original as any other band out there. Sure, they're straying from their comedic roots, but if you can find one band that has done the exact same thing over a period of five to seven years, I don't want to listen to them. Part of what makes a band good is change, especially when that change shows off hidden talents (hint: Chuck is ten times more metal than All Killer No Filler). <br /> <br />The point is, this CD has more insightful lyrics and excellent instrumental skills than most metal bands out there, and since half the headbangers out there only want to listen to music that screams out of their stereos, Sum 41's talent is lost. I'd like to see all those guys in fifty years trying to bob their arthritic necks to Disturbed. <br /> <br />So stop hatin', and try to open your mind to a different noise.
B00005JO0J|5.0|Serenity is that rare combination of an action packed movie with a brain. It has Joss Whedon's trademark humor and whip snap jumps from laughter to tears to gasps and edge of the seat exhileration. The first ten minutes pretty much fill you in on all you need to know about the `verse, although certainly a familiarity with the characters from the series Firefly can only enhance your enjoyment.  It does what science fiction does at its best, takes modern issues and ideas and put them in a new context. Truth, belief, freedom, all with a delicious candy coating of space battles and gun fights. And if you're still unconvinced, so a web search, there are sites out there that have the first nine minutes of the movie for a free look. Try it. You'll like it.

Thomas Jane and LL Cool J was good and the scenes between him and his bird were funny. Saffron Burrows is really a good actress and a very good looking woman!

0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises in my opinion is an ok book. The scenery never really changed during the book which kinda made the book boring in a way, but since it was mostly conversation it also went at a decent pace. The characters in the book were quite pathetic ecept for the narrator(Jake). He seemed to have a decent head on his shoulders when he wasn't drunk. The character Brett Ashely was terrible! If a woman acted like she did now days she'd have no friends and would have to move from place to place after she was done making her rounds with all the men in town. She was a horrible drunk that couldn't make up her mind about who she wanted to be with or when she wanted to settle down. By the end of the book she was 34 dating a 17yr old spanish bull fighter and had been with every man in the book except Jake. However they did kiss a lot in the beginning and he'd always ask her to be with him and i never knew why they didn't ever settle down b/c they both claimed to \\"love\\" each other. If you love someone and are toying with the idea of settling down shouldn't you consider marrying them? This Brett chick had me going nuts through out the whole novel because one minute she'd be with one guy for a while, wind up breaking his heart and move on to the next cute guy she found. I just don't agree with that. Another thing that kinda bothered me about this book was the fact that they were always drinking. I've never heard of people that drink as much as they do, not even alcoholics. Over all I did like the book because it wasn't just in America's back yard, it took place in different countries. I never really grasped a moral or lesson out of this book. The ending was annoying in a way because it left you wondering what was next in the middle of action. I love to read those books as long as they have another one right after to explain it.  <br />-PRCHELSEAPENNY
B00004STUL|5.0|I loved this movie. It's without a doubt Will Smith's best. Martin Lawrence was very good, too. If you want to catch Lawrence at his best I suggest everyone see \\"Nothing Lose\\" (loved this film)! Anyway I think this was a brilliant film. Smith and Lawrence made a great team. This is definitely Bruckheimer's best.

Would someone please hand this guy a copy of the Gould recording and tell him to go out to the woodshed for 50 years.<br /><br />It is just not intelligible and void of intelligence. Too many changes in tempi and dynamics brings out all the wrong emphasis.

B000000P17|1.0|This was just strange as far as I'm concerned.  It's not unusual for a band to do cover songs, but it is unusual for a band to put out an entire album of cover songs.  I wonder why they - or let's be frank here, Axl - felt like he needed to do this.  To say this was a weak ending to their career is the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it.  After the phenomenal success of the Illusion albums we get ... this?  Well, it's something.  Covers are covers, even if it's one you really like.  I never listen to this one, but it will remain in my collection.  This is like all those boxes of cereal in the pantry - not enough to eat but too much to throw away.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Any \\"reviews\\" of the reunion discs, though interesting to read, are quite unnecessary. The simple fact that the DVDs and CDs exist is more than reason enough for a Cream fan to grab them immediately. Hey, I would have happily paid for a DVD of Ginger, Jack and Eric just talking about the possibility of getting together, let alone actually playing. <br /> <br />Ignore any comments you find here about today's Cream versus yesterday's. The guys are consummate players regardless of age, and they clearly care deeply about the music. The songs are indeed performed differently than they were in the old days, but they are still every bit as authentic. The band is truly extraordinary, and they have nothing at all to apologize for - except keeping us waiting for this for so many years! <br /> <br />(Actually, I do have one more wish in case you guys happen to be reading this: How about a brand new, never-before-heard Cream song? or two? or three? or more...?!)

B000AVFLX0|5.0|<br /> <br />This is an amazing film, that gets better with each repeated viewing. \\"2046\\" is a hotel room number, which for the hero, Chow, encapsulates his lost love, as it unfolded in the prequel to this movie, \\"In the Mood for Love.\\" Here, \\"2046\\" also becomes a year to which one can travel by a time-machine type of train, a year in which it is believed people can recapture their lost memories. The film consists of the hero, who has loved and lost, going through a series of encounters with women, who in their turn have loved and lost. Throughout his series of experiences with women, he is in fact only looking for his lost love, Su Lizhen, but he can never refind her.  <br /> <br />This is a rough, simplified plot synopsis, but the movie is much more complex than this, and it requires repeated viewings to enhance understanding. The repeated viewings are extremely rewarding, as this film is one of those art objects from which the viewer can draw new insights with each reexperiencing of it. <br /> <br />The cinematography is beautiful, and the musical score is absolutely superb and moving, underscoring the emotions felt by the characters. The music is designed to enhance our experience of each scene and to intensify emotion. Granted, the film is not an easy one to follow. Personally, I felt confused at times, especially on a first viewing. But at such moments you can just let yourself go with the emotion carried through image and sound.  <br /> <br />\\"2046\\" rewards us with a beautiful and talented cast. I really enjoyed watching all the actresses that paraded on screen, among them Zhang Ziyi, of \\"Hero\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,\\" Gong Li, Carina Lau, Faye Wong and Maggie Cheung, all of them giving superb performances. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, it is not mandatory to see the prequel \\"In the Mood for Love\\" to understand \\"2046,\\" but it is well worth it, as there are many symbols from the previous film repeated in this one, and a scene where Su Lizhen reappears in Chow's memory. Personally, I liked \\"2046\\" better. <br /> <br />Finally, I have to add that this film, though from my point of view amazing, is certainly not for everyone. If you prefer a straightforward storyline and a plot where things are happening all the time, then this film is not for you. This film emphasizes emotional experience at the expense of plot. As long as you come prepared for this, and with the right expectations, it is a great film, very rewarding and very worthy of repeated viewings. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000524CY|5.0|I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was nine years old.  From that time on, it has haunted me ever since.  I have never seen a movie that deeply effected me like The Exorcist.  Now that I'm a grown adult, I'm able to sit through a full viewing of the film, but still feel an eerie feeling surround me as I watch what true evil looks like.   <br /> <br />I think that is why so many people are frightened of this film.  For the first time, people are able to come face to face with The Devil himself. There are no one liners to break up the tension.  In fact, this movie is so dead serious that it's almost like watching a documentary as to what would happen if some innocent person were to have Satan knocking on their doorstep.  Many people will say that this film is blasphemous, and in a way it is, but the writer and director wanted to truly show how evil Satan can be.  Copious amounts of profanity, desecration of religious objects, and freakish supernatural incidents are prevelant throughout this film, not to add to shock value, but to convey the message of true evil.   <br /> <br />In some other horror movies (such as the slasher films), victims are able to escape from their enemies either by physical force or intellegence, but for some innocent person being attacked by an invisible, malevolent force is scary as hell.  It is something that cannot be explained.  The victim is being surrounded by a macabre scene that is enigmatic over a prolonged period of time.  The viewer gets to witness what a tortured soul is subjected to.   <br /> <br />For those who do not believe in Satan or for those who do, but believe that possession could never happen, can still be frightened by the visual aspect of the film.  Sure, some of the special effects may seem outdated, but the general ambience is still frightning.  Anyone who has not seen this movie, but is a big fan of the horror genre or just wants to get scared, this is a must see.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I havent listened to this album for my love of the Foo died out really back in 2000 when Nothing Left... came out. The first two Foo albums are amazing and while I repspect the talent and mystique of Dave Grohl they just dont do anyhting for me anymore. All mY Life is a good song but the rest of One by One is boring. Times like These was cheesy. bleh. <br /> I see a lot of negative reviews, so I dont think I'll even waste my time just to be disappointed. The first single Best of You sucks and the second DOA is actually pretty good.  <br />Do yourself a favor and get Foo Fighters and The Colour and The Shape. They are two of the better albums of the 90s

0792164903|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies to watch at Halloween.  I've always loved the original story by Washington Irving and have enjoyed the various film and animated adaptions over the years.  Tim Burton takes a few liberties with the script turing Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) into a NY City police constable rather than the skittish school teacher.  Then there's the witchcraft subplot which I could have done without but I guess Burton felt was needed to beef up what was a short story.<br /><br />Depp shows why he is so good at playing diversified, slightly askew roles as his constable Crane is every bit as timid and nervous as Crane was supposed to be as the school teacher.  Crane believes the story the villagers tell of the Headless Horseman is pure myth and sets about using his modern detective ways to uncover the killer.  Jeffrey Jones has appeared in several early American themed films including Ravenous and the Crucible and this time plays the town Reverend with his usual fervor.  Christina Ricci also shines as katrina Van Tassel and Casper Van Dien is the jealous Brom Bones who torments Crane disguised as the Horseman.<br /><br />What really makes the movie is the atmostphere...I love the opening with the wealthy merchant travelling the misty shrouded road as he has the films first deadly encounter with the Horseman.  Burton does a wonderful job of capturing an authentic look and feel of early America.  The effects were very well done and also give credit to the great Christopher Walken as the Hessian soldier, sharpened teeth and all, who would go onto become the phantom horseman.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are slight but very good.  There's a lenghty making of documentary, interviews with the cast, and commentary by Burton.  Just a fantastic movie to watch at this time of the year.

B000059XUI|5.0|Superman II, almost 25 years later remains one of the greatest superhero movies ever made and is one of the few cases where the sequel was better than the original.  Superman II was actually shot at the same time as the first although I did not know this until seeing the Special Edition of the original film.<br /><br />In this sequel, Clark and Lois are sent to Niagra Falls to cover a story leading to Clark being outed as Superman when he falls into a fire place and doesn't suffer a scratch.  This leads to Lois expressing her love for Superman/Clark.  Clark makes the ultimate sacrifice.  He flies lois to the fortress of Solitude and uses a strange Kryptonian machine that takes away his power and makes him as human as the rest of use.  A fact that hits home hard when Clark is beaten up by a trucker in a roadside diner.<br /><br />meanwhile, the three Kryptonian criminal imprisoned in the Phantom Zone in the first film, General Zod, Ursa, and Non, have escaped and come to Earth, basically wreaking havok and forcing the president (E.G. Marshall) to surrender the White House to the trio who have all the powers of Superman.  Meanwhile Lex Luthor (gene hackman) offers his services to the trio and is about to be killed until he reveals what that he knows that Superman is the son of Jor-El, the man who imprisoned them.<br /><br />Once Superman learns of the trio he's shattered.  He returns to the Fortress of Solitude.  Now, it's never explained how Superman gets his powers back since the process was supposedly irreversible, but this of course this leads to a tremendous battle in Metropolis and dazzling, pre-CGI special effects.  The fight with the trio is the highlight of the film.  Especially Superman tossing Zod into a giant neon coke sign.  The product placements in this film are some of the most outlandish in film history.  Especially when Superman gets thrown through the Marlboro truck.  The only weak effect was when the villains throw the bus which looks pretty bad.<br /><br />This is what a superhero movie should be about...great action, true heroics, and evil villains.  Some complain about the choppy editing and humor, but I really loved it all, especially the guy getting blown over by the villains wind and continuting his conversation on the pay phone.  Hackman was great again as the scheming Lex Luthor who didn't like playing second fiddle to the trio of Kryptonian villains.<br /><br />What we need now for next years 25th anniversary is a special edition with some commentary and more extras.  No reason a great film like this should have to be content with an ordinary DVD release.  Come on Warner Bros.!bad. <br /> <br />This is what a superhero movie should be about...great action, true heroics, and evil villains.

B000002LSV|3.0|ZZ TOP-GREATEST HITS: Originally \\"That Li'l Ol Band From Texas\\" was a greasy power trio steeped in gutbucket southern bloozer rock which served their legions of fans admirably. Starting with the mega-selling ELIMINATOR, those infernal curses of rock and roll, the dreaded synthesizer and the sequencer, began to dominate their sound. A red hotrod, dark shades, gyrating \\"Top-ettes\\", and Rip Van Winkle beards completed their schtick in trade. If any or all elements of this MTV makeover appalls the RNB purist in you, then pick up a copy of THE BEST OF ZZ TOP, crank up JESUS JUST LEFT CHICAGO or BEER DRINKERS AND HELL RAISERS, and pretend these cats called it quits in 1982. Otherwise, read on...GREATEST HITS offers the interchangable SHARP DRESSED MAN and GIMME ALL YOUR LOVIN' as the best of their musical metamorphesis, while the nadir is represented by new wavey duds SLEEPING BAG and VELCRO FLY (the latter thankfully missing here). The classic booty ode TUSH, JOHN LEE HOOKER chug-fest LA GRANGE, and funky fashion statement CHEAP SUNGLASSES are welcome \\"oldies\\", but where's their soul-searin' cover of SAM AND DAVE's STAX chestnut I THANK YOU? A new version of VIVA LAS VEGAS, complete with Elvis soundbites, is either good or awful, depending on your tolerance for such stuff. In short, if you like your ZZ over the Top, GREATEST HITS is a no-brainer.<br /><br />RATING: THREE RAZORS
B000069AUI|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say something to all you people who are wondering if you should buy coldplay or not. Take a look at all the people giving this cd, along with X&Y, and parachutes bad reviews, and 1 stars. Take a look at what else they have reviewed. They are giving everything poor reviews because their life is so boring that they have nothing better to do. Also, the poor reviews come from someone who listens to a completely different genre of music, such as rap, pop punk or metal. If you are a huge fan of rap,or metal and decide to listen to a coldplay cd, you probably wont like it you idiot. Just look at the kid above me who gave this cd 1 star. He gave simple plan and My chemical Romance 5 stars! Dont come on amazon and review cds when you obviously have no good taste in music! Why are you even reviewing this cd if you cut yourself off to only a certain couple genres of music. Of course, most rappers today have admitted that they are fans of coldplay. Weird huh? Second of all, if you listen to their cds once, and decide you dont like it, you dont know how to listen to music. A lot of music has to grow on people, but in this day in age of impatience, people rush through music and dont give it a chance. I myself have only reviewed a couple of things on amazon. I dont give reviews on bands, or movies that I have no idea about.     This cd is great if you like contemporary rock, even alternative, but dont go by the singles on the radio. Some of the singles coldplay have released arent even the best sounding songs on the cd, although, if you like what you hear on the radio, pick up their music.     Also, if people are comparing this to pink floyd, and suggesting that they are better than pink floyd or U2, why are you even arguing with them. Of course coldplay isnt better. The band themselves have even said that they arent very good. While, I think that they are a great band, and they are very talented artist, they will never be as good as the people that camebefore them. Just realize that. I am a huge coldplay fan, but Pink Floyd is obviously better. Maybe in time, coldplay will be known as one of the best bands ever, but until then, just enjoy the ride. This cd is great. Every song is good. Wait, no, a whisper is actually my least favorite coldplay song ever. Other than that, every song on here is classic, and you should definitely pick this up before you buy X&Y, because this cd is far superior.
B0001XAS1M|5.0|MEAT LOAF-BAT OUT OF HELL: Mountain's Leslie West and Mama Cass aside, rock has produced precious few 300 pound icons like this one time Ted Nugent vocalist, unnoticed Motown artist, and ROCKY HORROR SHOW scene-stealer. Even if you've never heard a note of BAT OUT OF HELL (which is unlikely), this everything-INCLUDING-the-kitchen-sink masterpiece deserves legendary status for its jaw-droppin' cover art alone. Backed by a quirky cast including sax maniac Edgar Winter, soul-beltin' mama Ellen Foley, motormouth baseball legend Phil Rizzuto, and members of the E Street Band and Utopia, Meat Loaf's debut was a schlock-splattered tag team effort with bombastic, lyrically longwinded composer/pianist Jim Steinman. Crammed with SPECTOR-esque groove-ology and maniacal musical maneuvers, the seven sonic slabs of operatic slam-glam here are really mini-plays...in fact, boy-meets-girl barnburner PARADISE BY THE DASHBOARD LIGHT is divided into three subtitled acts. Super-producer/guitar guru Todd Rundgren lets rip like a Harley in heat on the crash 'n burn title track, the Loaf sweetly laments lost lust on TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T BAD, and you can almost smell the sexual sweat on ALL REVVED UP WITH NO PLACE TO GO. He may be thinner now and sport a better hairstyle, but BAT OUT OF HELL will forever remain Meat Loaf's meal ticket to musical immortality.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE BURGERS
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When FOX aired the \\"Firefly\\" series, they fell into the typical network programming trap of under-promoting and irregular airing, or pitting it against a ratings monster like \\"CSI\\". It's like executives don't understand that some shows need time to build an audience. But oops, here comes Ratings Time; your show doesn't get the numbers, so off you go! I had only seen half the aired episodes (if that) and by the time I could find the show again, it was gone. Then I heard there was a fan club and through it heard that series producer Joss Whedon was coming out with \\"Serenity\\", a \\"Firefly\\" movie. Joy! Panic! What have I missed? Can I ever catch up? <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" wasn't crash-bang from the start, it wasn't an epic, it was just a decently written space-cowboy show, only nowhere near as cheesy as they premise would have led you to believe. (Anyone remember groaning at the title, \\"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer\\"?) By viewing one show at at a time on DVD, you discover an arcane oddity they used to call a \\"story line\\" and you realise what a wonderful TV series we've lost. Like a good book, it takes a little time to get into it and open it up, more time than a network is willing to give you before trying to sell you something. <br /> <br />Basically, if you want to completely understand \\"Serenity\\", see the whole series as it was intended to be shown. Watch all the special features. Listen to Ron Glass laugh out loud for the first time since \\"Barney Miller\\". Crawl through the Serenity set by set. Feel \\"caught-up\\", as I did, and then go see the film and catch what the rest of the audience missed--unless they're already Browncoats.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Except I DID when I watched this one. I'm a grown man for gosh sakes, but when the grandfather got down beside her bed, called her a name of honor and made his confession, I totally lost it. Just lost it like a baby. Heck, I'm getting tears in my eyes just thinking about it. I went on to read the novel, and I must say that it helped me understand the movie in an even deeper way. If you enjoyed the movie, you really must read the novel. You must. I mean it. <br /> <br />This story, while the setting and some of the cultural backdrops are unique and intriguing is a retelling of the One great story--you know, the story of the innocent one who dies for those who are not worthy, returns to life and brings hope and joy to all. This is a brilliant way of retelling it, absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br />
B000B5IPLK|1.0|I was so shocked when I saw that ugly \\"content protected\\" logo on this CD.  Copy protection means that this CD is incompatible with the iPod, the largest-selling MP3 player in the world.  Why Sony/BMG would knowingly make a CD that can't be used on iTunes is a mystery.  Copy-protection lessens the customer experience and alienates honest consumers who use iPods.

B00005JOHU|1.0|Cage on par with his usual wooden acting self, with a host of grimaces of disgust and dismay, but i ll hand it to him his growing more and more hair as he ages. <br /> <br />The plot is so formulaic and simplistic also. I got sick and tired of having my emotions blackmailed by the symbolism of children in this movie, first a couple of kids are getting shot by a firing squad in pakistan, then there's nick's own nauseating toddler being \\"shot\\" (he,he) up close to emphasize the child's wild eyed innocence and the dad's guilt and complicity (how deep is that?) then a few kids thrown here and there amongst the mayhem and debris in the countries nick \\"visits\\", and i almost puked in the scene where the drug dealers plane force lands just a few centimeters away from a two year old. Please, no MORE! And, come on, i know this is aimed at maistream audiences in just about every corner of the world, hence the lowest common denominator stategy, but even your average movie goer deserves better than that. <br /> <br />Then there's the action, nothing much happens, and i mean that, the movie just doesn't change pace, nick's chased here and there by an interpol agent (and that doesn't happen all that often either) and by some loophole or trick he manages to escape the long hand of law, till, the catch him on a technicality and that about it folks.  <br /> <br />Then again, there's the complete implausibility of cage as gun dealer opperating alone (he occasionally takes his younger bro, presumably for the ride) with just a few paid contacts, come on, he's a friggin gun dealer!!! These people don't just pop up sell a few guns and leave... <br /> <br />And then besides copola's nephew we get two very badly drawn, almost cartoonist, characters to serve as his wife and bro (the bro perpetually sniffing coke as a running gag i suppose) and the trophy wife in complete oblivion till just about five minutes from the end, talk about an undevelloped script, but i guess that's what hollywood wants these days. (The cliches of the film don't stop even when it comes to the music, one case in point, nick and bro crack a couple of lines of coke while driving around, and what inspired musical piece do we get? Can anyone guess? And yes, yes, it is j.j. cale's cocaine the bilionth time on film to emphasize, well, what else, coke.) <br /> <br />Oh, and dialog is sharp, razor sharp, it's so sharp the screenwriter would probably have used this razor sharp analogy to say how sharp it is. Nick's bro out of the blue turns to him, gives him an intense and meaningful look, and goes \\"these things are killing, you, on the inside\\". Wow, the poetry in that. But of course an artful director muses with his camera too, as when nick finds his kid's toy gun and throws it (up close on the garbage bin) away. Brilliant, just brilliant. <br /> <br />Barring the antirussian propaganda as another reviewer pointed out, i suppose this is one more of the multitude of cia financed flicks, i 'd be willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt  were it in any respect half decent, but trust me it isn't, or watch it if you got half a brain and weep over your hard earned money.
B00005JO0J|2.0|I am a HUGE sci-fi fan, and my sister felt that taking me to see 'Serenity' would be a nice birthday present...unfortunately it just plain wasn't.  I have read so many reviews and heard so much from those who are familiar with the background of this movie, and almost all say you do NOT have to know anything about all that to understand and appreciate 'Serenity'.  I say BS.  As the movie began I felt like I had come in 20 minutes AFTER it had started.  It took a while for me to pick up what was going on and I really don't think I am stupid.<br /><br />For some to call this a modern-day Star Wars is an Injustice to that masterpiece.  Sure, many will say that 'Time will tell' regarding that statement...but I think the box-office numbers are already saying that FOR me.  I don't CARE if Ebert & Roeper gave the film two thumbs up (which they apparently did), the movie was okay at best, and without being really well versed with the back-story in the plot and where it all came from, this movie simply did not \\"Do It\\" for me.  I honestly wish that it had, but sorry, it just didn't.<br /><br />Aside from all of that, there WERE some genuinely entertaining moments throughout the film.  The special effects were by and large pretty good (which I am a real stickler about noticing).  Even though I knew virtually nobody from the movie (for the most part anyway) I felt that all the characters were well cast and the fact that I was unfamiliar with most of them did not bother me in the least.  Surprisingly funny moments came out of left field on occasion which made the experience much better than it would have otherwise.  On the whole, I guess for those who are better acquianted with the movie and how it came to be, this is probably wonderful, and I can see many really enjoying it -- however for those of us who are NOT aware of all that, be prepared to be confused from the get-go.  Don't worry, it all seems to make sense by the ending, but unfortunately the movie takes way too long to get there to make it all that worthwhile.ng to get there to make it all that worthwhile.
B0002KPHXS|5.0|Ingrid Bergman made her English-speaking film debut in the romantic tear-jerker, \\"Intermezzo.\\"  She plays Anita, a young woman who gives piano lessons to the daughter of a famous violinist, Holger Brandt (Leslie Howard).  Brandt is first attracted by her musical talent and soon they are a couple, meeting in dark cafes.  He leaves his family and takes Anita on tour with him.  They are having a wonderful time until a friend from home visits them.<br /><br />Bergman is so young and luminous; who wouldn't fall in love with her?  She's very good as Anita, having played the role in the 1936 Swedish film.  Howard channels his Ashley Wilkes role; he's tortured, weak, and confused.  At 70 minutes, the movie is too short; I would have liked for it to move slower and show the couple together more (they meet and in the next scene, they are already guilty lovers).  The music, chiefly \\"Intermezzo\\" by Provost, is lovely and adds to the bittersweet quality of the film.  A touching romance with beautiful stars.
B000055ZB8|4.0|OK, my kids saw Van Helsing (dumb movie) at a sleepover last weekend and got into the whole Dracula thing so I sat down and did my research.  In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version.  Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!).  I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic.  Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times.  Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like \\"Count Liberace\\".  As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting.  I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and \\"Freaks\\" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled \\"Even Dwarfs Started Small\\") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the \\"Nosferatu's\\" are superior.  I'm gonna have to see every flick about \\"Drac\\" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.  The version with the \\"Type O Negative\\" soundtrack is also cool or just turn it down and lay down your own soundtrack!
B000A6T1KE|3.0|Nemesis is far from a perfect film.  We've still got Wacky Picard, Action Hero and another gratuitous scene of Data singing, two constant blights on the TNG film franchise.  We're asked to accept that Remus is not, in fact, inhabited by Romulans, but evil devil goblins we've never heard of before, and that Shinzon wants to destroy Earth for no discernable reason.  And yeah, the movie \\"borrows\\" many of its best parts from The Wrath of Khan.  But you know what?  It's *still* the best TNG film.  Generations captured the spirit of TNG as it was on TV, but had a terribly lame rehashed storyline.  First Contact was marginally better, but still owed much of its storyline to old Trek episodes and jettisoned everything that made TNG what it was, turning Picard into a weak Kirk analogue and Data into Spock, Jr. while sublimating the rest of the cast.  We shall not speak of Insurrection.  Nemesis, in spite of its obvious weaknesses, mostly gets the characters right and resurrects several characters (Guinan, Spot, Wesley Crusher) and character dynamics (Geordi and Data as friends) that haven't been seen since TNG ended its TV run and made its inaugural voyage to the big screen in 1994.  The plot is somewhat rehashed and occasionally cryptic, but it's not aggressively bad the way Insurrection's was, nor as obviously recycled as Generations and First Contact were.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a real two-hour epic featuring the Star Trek:  The Next Generation crew, I suggest you seek out The Best of Both Worlds 1&2 or All Good Things...  But if you're just looking for a minor diversion with some old friends, you really can't go wrong with this film, IMO.  Again, I simply cannot understand why it inspires such hatred amongst die-hard Trekkies.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Breathtaking, classic, inspiring, wonderful, I don't think there's a good word that can't describe this album. Ms. Keys is a wonderful performer as I have learned on her \\"Diary\\" tour. But this album is different because it's more intimate. She has a song on there called, \\"Stolen Moments\\" which is a good enough song to buy the whole album! She also has some other new songs. \\"Wild Horses\\" with Adam Levine is amazing!!! Go out and purchase this album! It's definetely worth it!
B000AA305M|4.0|It's no White Ladder, but what is? I actually like this album a bit more than his last one. The good thing about DG, I've noticed, is that you can't go wrong with his music. Even if you're disappointed and expected/hoped for more, you're still getting quality music. This album is good. It's not fantastic or spectacular, but it's good. <br /> <br />I will say I appreciate his approach on a lot of these songs of starting the song slow and building it at the end, almost as if he takes a shot of coffee and really gets into the song. It's kind of like earning it. Alibi, Lately, and Now & Always are what I'm talking about in this regard.
6305657947|5.0|It is rare to find such a fine blend of drama, culture, and romance in a film and this one has got it all!  Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo give excellent performances in this remake of the old Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway classic!  A must see!
B00006EXL5|4.0|I hadn't heard this album before I bought MCR's second album Three Cheers. I was absolutely astonished when I bought Bullets becasue the two are completely different. Bullets is a very raw and hard album. Three Cheers is more polished and not as heavy when it comes to the sound. The lyrics for both though speak volumes. If you are an MCR fan, or wanting to become one, this album is a necessity.
0446608955|4.0|\\"A Walk To Remember\\", though written only a few years ago, is already a classic romance novel. It's the best one I've ever read probably. I can't believe it's written by a man!! Wow. I think that any girl or woman over the age of about 12 will absolutely adore it. Boys and men probably won't, but I don't know, some might. And it's not nasty at all, like many books written lately, it's just a nice book that younger people can enjoy as well as older teens and adults. If you're any fan of romance or of Nicholas Sparks, or just loved the movie, then this book is for you!
B000001Y79|5.0|No Doubt's first three albums are great. While my favorites are their self titled and The Beacon St. Collection, they still have the magic here. They always have some magic moments where the weird sounds come together just perfect with Gwen's voice. There's many highlights here I won't even try to go through them all.
B00000634J|5.0|Great collection of varying moods from John. Working Class Hero is as timely as ever along with Watchin the Wheels. C'mon US federal dictatorship, GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!
B000001FA4|5.0|U2's 1984 release, the Unforgettable Fire, has proven to be the key to U2's timelessness.  The album proved to be a shock to those fans who had come aboard during the Boy/October/War era as it was nothing at all like the band's first three albums.  It's a very moody, atmospheric piece that has proven to be timeless, something much music from 1984 has not proven to be.  It is this album that forever removed the possibility that U2 would be just another guitar band or protest band and paved the way for the landmark 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, which vaulted U2 to the pinnacle of the music world, a place they've inhabited ever since.   <br /> <br />U2 had experimented before.  The previous effort, War, featured more politically oriented lyrics (U2 had been very personal on the first two LPs) and introdduced more vocalization, keyboards, and even brass and strings on some tracks.  The Unforgettable Fire would go far beyond the attempts of war, changing the sound completely. <br /> <br />So what do we have?  Pride (In the Name of Love) is well known.  Much else here is not recognized by the casual listener.  A Short of Homecoming comes with beautiful imagery and a beat that moves it forward.  Pride is what it is, a great rock anthem.  Wire is much more kinetic and confused, though I think this is intentional.  The Unforgettable Fire is a beautiful song that contains more poetic imagery.  Promenade is a personal favorite.  4th of July is a moody instrumental.  Bad is one of the best songs U2 has ever written.  Indian Summer Sky is akin to Wire - very kinetic.  Elvis Presley and America is often hammered, but it may be favorite track.  The lyrics was improvised at the behest of Eno and the imagery is fantastic.  I also find the song to be full of raw emotion.  MLK is an atmospheric tribute to Dr. King. <br /> <br />Throughout the album the lyrics and sounds are imprecise and not as firm as the U2 of the previous three albums.  This lends a real timelessness to the album.I'll admit, it took me several listens to really get into the album - the most of any U2 album - but the rewards are even more satisfying.  This album takes you somewhere and leaves you with a smile as opposed to U2's darker works that would come after it.  This would be U2's brightest effort until All That You Can't Leave Behind and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.  Most of their catalog is somewhat optimistic albeit dark.  This one is not so and is a joy to listen to; give it a chance.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|The film that recusitated the historical epic, \\"Gladiator\\" is an awesome filmmaking achievement. Exciting fight sequences, cutting-edge special effects, and breathtaking performances help to take the viewer back to the Roman era, a time of both intolerable cruelty and technological advancement. The film is truly the masterpiece of Sir Ridley Scott!<br /><br />The new DVD release has a great host of special features, including a 200-Minute Making-of Documentary. But, best of all, the DVD features two versions of the film: the 155-Minute Theatrical Cut, and the 171-Minute Extended Cut. Both versions are given terrific sound and picture quality! Any fan of the film, or of historical epics for that matter, will want the new Extended DVD Edition of \\"Gladiator\\" in their collection!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B000002A3T|5.0|This is just one amazing piece of music.It feels like every track just perfectly blends itself unto the next.it is a real visual piece,and it really taps into all the human emotions.my feelings for this album rate very highly,a true classic and imo the best in this catalog.
B000002LE6|5.0|I can't describe why this is one of my favourite Prince albums. It came out at a time where it complimented my life--my own personal soundtrack. It's a joy to be heard.
B000286RNY|4.0|A silly movie on martial arts masters playing soccer with lots of action.  Give it five stars if you like Kung Fu Hustle or martials arts classics.
B00003CXAE|3.0|Randal Kleiser's twelfth film \\"Grease\\", starring high school heart-throb Danny(John Travolta), and Australian goody-goody Sandy(Olivia Newton John), is a pure classic. Everyone has seen and loved this hysterical musical.  <br /> Danny and Sandy spend their summer days frolicking on the beach, content in summer loving. Once school starts again, Danny, thinking he will never see Sandy again, is back to his old tricks, until he finds out she is also going to the same school. Of course the standards of being as slick as hair grease don't exactly make him very appealing to Sandy, and the two go through a series of ups and downs before finally reuniting at the film's end. <br /> The high school starts to buzz with stories about Danny and Sandy, as one by one everyone puts two and two together and connect Danny with Sandy. Danny, completely unaware of the extent of the rumors runs into the boys late one night who question the truth of these stories.  <br /> I thought that every song in this lovable comedy were interesting and funny. I was laughing constantly. It had a very thin plot, pretty much the basics; Boy mets girl. Girl mets boy. Boy and girl fall in love. Boy looses girl. And in the end Boy gets Girl back. Typical romance film. I had never seen one of Randal Kleiser's movies until I saw Grease, and I think I might pick one of his other movies the next time I go to Flicks And Picks.  <br /> I don't know if Randal Kleiser intended for the watcher to take anything away from this film, but I guess if u look really hard you could say that it is like a 1950's version of Romeo and Juilet. Two Sides, the greasers, Danny, and the goody goodies, Sandy. Even though their friends say that they shouldn't be together they still want to be with each other, but unlike Romeo and Juilet, Grease has a happy ending, and Danny and Sandy don't die.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|Remember back in the early eighties, when filmmakers like Steven Spielberg just told great stories without all the politically correct nonsense which has inundated moviemaking in recent years?  A perfect example is \\"E.T.\\" <br /> <br />Probably my all-time favorite movie, \\"E.T.\\" still makes me laugh and cry like it did when I saw it in theaters over and over again when I was nine (about the same age as Henry Thomas was in the film).  I think I related to it very well because it's really about the boy Elliott, not about the alien.  Elliott is a young boy whom no one listens to or takes seriously until the end, when he proves himself to be intelligent, selfless, and brave.  I liked this theme because it should teach parents that their children are human beings with feelings with a lot more brains than they are given credit for. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have pointed out, I don't like the changes that Spielberg has made in the Special Edition DVD.  He should have kept the rifles in the chase scene because when the rifle is pointed at Elliott before his bicycle takes off into the sky, it proves that Elliott has grown and cares more about E.T. than himself as he faces imminent danger to save his alien friend. <br /> <br />I also didn't like the CGI effects used which made E.T.'s eyes look different as he was watching TV.  It's easy to see that it was computer-generated.  <br /> <br />Although it was a mistake for Spielberg to tinker with his classic, it would take a lot more than what he did to ruin this movie for me.  \\"E.T.\\" still brings back great memories for me as a child, and it is a film to be cherished from generation to generation.  I feel honored that it was in my generation that the movie was made.
B000001Y5D|4.0|There is some great screaming here, great guitar playing as well. Almost all of the vocal harmonies work, and are extremely expressive. It sounds like everything they had inside came out recording this, their only album. It's straight from the gut.
B000002J09|5.0|It's simply still far too early to adequately quantify Jimmy Page's 'way before time' genius as a record producer. And if any Zeppelin fans were naive enough in 1969 to doubt that the second album could ever be surpassed in terms of both melodic and lyrical content and then again with quality of production, well - with this '71 planet of a work, they must have wondered whether their lives were to be mapped forever. Whatever the eventual outcome of the heated deliberances of the millions of Zeppelin fans - both present, and future (trillions), I'm personally convinced that the fourth album will remain the band's eternal anchorage. It woke the world to Zeppelin; it fuelled the imagination for both the film and what immediately followed the film in terms of 'now what?' And 'Stairway To Heaven' - its piece de resistance - has since topped numerous alltime polls served up by numerous crap radio stations of numerous standings, who all HAD to eventually admit they couldn't fend it off for ever, and base a national vote around it!  Don't just get it. Get it on everything. Then stick it at the back, for when class comes round to visit. The kids'll thank you. You'll thank you.

0307276902|5.0|Like many of you, I scan these reviews for recommendations on what next to read.  And also like many of you, I have very little free time to waste on fluff or repackaged ego trips. <br /> <br />So after reading many perceptive and highly various reviews, I electronically threw down my ten bucks and change and got myself a copy of \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" and I haven't looked back since. <br /> <br />The editorial reviews provide enough story outline that I need not repeat it here.  Instead, I will relate the effect this book had on my life. <br /> <br />I read this manual (yes, I see it as a manual, for reasons which will become obvious) in a fevered trance, picturing every nerve-razing detail with hallucinatory clarity.  I read the last sentence, closed the book, and immediately began drinking, sniffing, smoking, and shooting up. <br /> <br />Why would I do such a crazy thing, especially after having finished a tale full of cautionary woe?  Because it is the first step to fame and fortune!  Who can deny the authenticity of the author who willingly and freely indulges his basest needs and then calls them addictions?  I'm not saying it's an easy path.  My alcohol bill alone would fund an ivy-league education, and I apparently owe \\"The Cowboy\\" over fifty Gs in drug money, but these are investments, investments which will bear rich fruit years from now after I get myself detoxed and an agent. <br /> <br />America loves a reformed sinner!

B0009JAENU|5.0|I had very high expectations for this album, as I do for all of Ms. Hahn's recordings.  As always, my expectations were met, and in this album I was pleasantly surprised with even more!  Anyone familiar with Ms. Hahn's playing knows she has amazing intonation, vibrato to die for, clear-warm-brilliant tone, and clarity and precision like none other.  This album lacks none of these techniques, and in addition contains energy and spirit of good Mozart.  Her well thought out phrasing shows she never stops maturing as a musician and I must emphasize this album does not lack musicality.  The years of collaboration between Ms. Hahn and Ms. Zhu show on this album.  A must for any Hilary fan!
B0001Z52RU|2.0|The movie is bad.  Really.  Doesn't follow the rules that establishes at the beggining, the acting is wooden, and overall seems rushed.  If you look at the \\"behind the scenes\\" featurette, you can understand that the two young directors have energy, but don't seem very, how to say it, intellectual in their approach to cinema.<br />This movie is about sadism and violence in general.  How people act against each other, and the results of their actions.  In this sense, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" work as an indictment of the cowboy syndrome.  But being this a latent interpretation, is not enough.  Anyway, the show of violence makes all of us voyeurs of many disturbing things.  As in any Hollywood war movie, to show violence and to insinuate or say that is bad is to be hypocrital.  For those who gave this movie many stars, please watch more (and better) cinema and then re-watch and have a say (again).
B000089RVX|5.0|I love everything about this album. This band is fully entrenched in their own sound that haunts and chases you down on every song. <br /> <br />Of course I love the more popular songs on the CD, but I really appreciated that little touch of Verdi's Requiem interlaced in the song> Hello. I grew up during the 60's and 70's so the older I get the fewer bands I enjoy of this generation; UNTIL NOW!! I can't wait for their next effort, it is sure to be a great one.
0380820846|5.0|I have read quite a few of Ms. Quinn's novels, and this one is by far my favorite!!!  The story flows very naturally, without elaborate twists, yet with interesting turns.  You really see Colin and Penelope grow closer, and pull for them through the book.  And the supporting characters are great.  Highly recommend!!!
B00004RF98|5.0|This is my wife's alltime favorite movie. She is a Gene Kelly fan. Personally I think Donald O'Conner does an incredible job. They along with Debbie Reynolds make this a delightful movie.
B00005KARK|5.0|As a Progressive Scan, HDTV Fan, I was brought back to basics when my 11 month old son ignored \\"Finding Nemo\\" in HD glory, in favor of Disney's \\"Dumbo\\".  This movie from the 1940's is a true classic, as he is fixated on the music and images.  I have thought about buying the Soundtrack, but am afraid to ruin the magic of the movie for him.  I would put this on a new parent DVD list along with Baby Einstein (Mozart & Nemo DVD's).
B000063DI9|5.0|Well, I have all albums chronilogically up to this one and I would say by far, this is their absolute best.  All the songs just kick ass.  There is not one song I don't like.  Do yourself a big favor and buy this masterpiece.
0743454537|4.0|Am I the only one that saw this ending coming from a mile away??  I was disappointed. I thought it would be a lot more interesting to read another variety of resolution, if a family could ever achieve such a thing, under those circumstances. <br /> <br />Other than the ending, I found the book compelling and thought-provoking.

B000AARKOO|4.0|Kingdom of Heaven was one movie I had been waiting to see even before they started filming it, and I kept monitoring it until it's release date (and of course I was among the first to see it at the cinema). After I left I felt very unsatisfied. I felt the movie was extremely hollow, empty and lacking serious depth. The characters were paperthin and uninteresting. The editting was mediocre (never showing or giving full explanation of Why and How things happened). Orlando Bloom's portrayal of Balian was very boring and dull, and it feels like the moviemakers didn't focus on the character development. This is such a shame, since Kingdom of Heaven had so much potential: epic story, good characters, good setting, good director, good composer, good actors (Ed Norton, among others), etc. However, in the end, the movie is a dissapointment...a big, luxurous box with little content inside. This was the definate dissapointment.    However, visually, this movie surpasses many in recent time. The looks of Kingdom of Heaven is just STUNNING, and here Ridley Scott succeeded in what he does best: to create a visual epic. From the dark, cold, dreary winter forests of Europe to the bright, sandy, and windy deserts of Jerusalem saturated in blue and orange color respectively...Kingdom of Heaven is a success in this department that makes this movie simply worth watching. Seeing a massive army march through the barren plains of the desert is an awesome spectacle. So this movie isn't an entire failure, since the director succeeded in what he is known for. Fans of Ridley Scott should not spend one minute hesitating to see this movie. The attention to visual detail he puts into the making is extremely impressive.     Anyway, the movie revolves around Balian of Ibelin, who went from a French blacksmith to become a Knight taking command to defend Jerusalem against the honorable Muslim leader Saladin. All of this is based on a true story and all characters (except Godfrey of Ibelin played byLiam Neeson) existed in real life. The characters all have their places in the movie and a purpose, but none are particularly developed 100%. We already know for what purpose they serve in the film, but it's a shame that there wasn't enough time and space to truly develope them. The dialogues aren't bad, and some are in fact powerful. But the editting is just horrendous, and I think is a major factor how the movie got damaged. Things happen without being properly shown or explained, and there are huge gaps in between. Basically, this movie jumps forward too far a lot.     All in all, Kingdom of Heaven is a flawed and empty epic, but what makes up for the lack of depth is the looks, feel and atmosphere. But don't have any expectations before you watch this film and do not expect it to be better than Gladiator, Braveheart (alongside other epics) despite the state-of-the-art technical achievements.
B00028HBKM|1.0|Please DO NOT waste your time, money, or energy on this worthless film.  It is filled with lies, and far too much violence.  We must teach peace and love.  Jesus is surely ashamed of this film.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I missed the original airing of this series and only learned that the new movie Serenity was based on it.  All the trailers looked good and as a fan of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\", I figured anything by Joss Wheedon was a safe bet.  I was thrilled when I got the set - a whole season of shows for $30!  Can't beat it!  It's a shame that Fox didn't let it survive, but if you saw \\"Serenity\\" the movie and loved it, you'll love this series and get all the back story.  If you haven't seen the movie, getting this series will leave you wanting more and you'll go see it to get another taste.  It's well written (with a Western flair) and the characters are engaging.  I recommend this to any fan of Sci-Fi.
B00006YXP0|4.0|Although I bought this collection a couple of years ago when it first came out, I had not been able to review it on Amazon because I could never find it listed on the website.  (I'm still unsure why the title is listed in French here.)  &#34;The Art of Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli&#34; is an 8CD &#34;collectors edition&#34; box set featuring many of the pianist's best recordings for Deutsche Grammophon from 1957-1990, all in stereo.  As no track information is listed above, this set contains the following:<br /><br />CD1: Mozart PCs 13 & 15, Garben/NDR-Sinfonieorchester<br />CD2: Mozart PCs 20 & 25, Garben/NDR-Sinfonieorchester<br />CD3: Beethoven PCs 1 & 3, Giulini/Vienna<br />CD4: Beethoven PC 5 (Giulini/Vienna) & PS 4<br />CD5: Schubert PS in A Minor, D537; Chopin Mazurkas (10 total), Prelude (op. 45), Ballade (op. 23) & Scherzo (op. 31)<br />CD6: Schumann Carnaval & Faschingsschwank aus Wien; Brahms Ballades (op. 10)<br />CD7: Debussy Preludes I & Children's Corner<br />CD8: Debussy Preludes II & Images I & II<br /><br />Most of this material has been available on CD before, with three discs worth continuing to be available on single titles in the midline &#34;DG Originals&#34; series -- the Beethoven 1 & 3 with Giulini, Brahms Ballade/Schubert Sonata & Beethoven Sonata, and Debussy Preludes & Images -- and the Mozart 13 & 15 at full-price.  The highlights of the set in my opinion are the Debussy, the Brahms Ballades, and the Beethoven 1st and &#34;Emporer&#34; Concerto, made for TV along with the 3rd, which is not as strong.  Of lesser importance to me were the Mozart Concertos and Chopin pieces, though they were still enjoyable.  But regardless of individual performances, Michelangeli is without question a unique artist and most deserving of being included in all classical music collections.  The question is whether you want to start with such a large collection, or just a single title.
6305546789|5.0|I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth.  The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era.  I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all.  There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature.  Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast?  That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.<br /><br />John Carpenter is the master of horror.  While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career.  This is his ultimate film.  While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next.  Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves.  With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you.  I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser.  That was scary, yet utterly brilliant.  I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air.  There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere.  Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't.  Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters.  This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.<br /><br />Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music.  I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window.  Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next.  It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster.  Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling.  The use of the \\"clown\\" mask sent shivers up my spine.  The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever!  It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film.  You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one.  I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again.  It is worth the repeat visit many times!<br /><br />Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history.  Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre.  This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats.  The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest.  Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters.  What can be better?<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****get tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre.

0307155102|5.0|I still have my book - 11th printing, 1971.  I have been reading it to my 2 year old son.  He loves it and I love it to.  I spent hours and hours poring over this book as a small girl.  I am getting my son a new copy for Christmas.  For me, this is a must have for every child.  It encourages reading, dreaming and imagination.  I LOVE THIS BOOK!
B00029LNHS|5.0|BEP has been one of my fave rap groups in the beginning and this CD (and its many variations, try out the chinese version, it has live songs) is definitely a stand out in awesome grooves. I've always loved their style of rapping and the fact that the members are avid breakdancers, they know exactly the knid of music that gets you moving on the dance floor. <br /> <br />I love this band because they are willing to try something NEW. They really catch your attention with the variety of themes in this album. This is a great album to cheer you up or wake up or if you work out. Very peppy and good tempos.   <br /> <br />My only regret is that Elephunk Theme is not on this album. I think thats one of their BEST new songs. Its use of the indian samples and choral pattern is hypnotic and really gets your head moving. <br /> <br />Don't be deceived by their poppy/party beats, this album has explicit lyrics and sexual content (no violent content). <br /> <br />As for the use of the word retarded in \\"Lets get retarded\\", i hope you people listen to something similar to what George Carlin said. <br /> <br />It's not the word you should be worried about, its the person who is saying it.

B00004SA88|5.0|Nicolo Paganini is primarily a virtuoso composer who did not compose anything other than for the violin in the early 19th century. He was a true prodigy of the instrument whose ferocious and innovative style of playing frightened many of the credulent folk into thinking he was the devil. With the increasing popularity of the waltz, he along with other romantics such as Beethoven completely revolutionized the concept of violin concertos that were still then mostly in the antiquated Roccoco menuet formulas of Mozart and Haydn. The caprices are more technical excercises for this new revolutionary style and are the cornerstones of all Romantic traditions of violin including the Romantic German and, to a much lesser extent, the Polish/Klezmer tradition of Joseph Joachim.    Salvatore Accardo is an accomplished violinist who performed many times with the most reputable groups such as I Musici di Roma and the English Chamber Orchestra. He was a long-time mentor of Anne-Sofie Mutter who performed with Karajan. Despite working often with various Baroque styles, Salvatore Accardo is primarily a specialist at Paganini and the Italian Romantic period and this is the main reason this recording is one of the best you can obtain for Paganini. Charles Dutoit is also an accomplished orchestral conductor and generally works very well with Rossini whose light romantic style in his operatic overtures have overlaps with the style in Paganini's contemporary symphonic arrangements for his violin concerti. Accardo and Dutoit were therefore a perfect match in performing Paganini and this ablum is a great example along with their other collaborations for the composer available on single CD. The music is light and joyful in its interpretation while many others tend to be heavy and sluggish. Accardo's performance is filled with vitality as he has complete mastery over the instrument and feels at ease in his performance without ever faltering. His performance brings out the fluidity and full range of Paganini's style very well. Salvatore Accardo's  performance of the caprices is also legendary in which he performs all of the most difficult pieces briliantly without effort: they are truly divine in every respect!     Although it's extremely difficult to make a judgment call between these three undisputed virtuosos of the violin and Paganini, Perlman and Heifetz would not be my first choices because they are not really masters of the Italian Romantic style as that of the German/Polish/Klezmer traditions.  However technical the differences might be, they do make a significant difference and so I prefer Accardo for Paganini as he is simply the foremost expert with this composer and the Italian Romantic style which Heifetz and Perlman are not.  This album is a great buy where you can get all of Paganini's passionate violin concerti and caprices at a good price. There are really few if any performances equal to this one on the market other than those of Perlman and Heifetz.  Such other performances, even by child prodigies, are simply beneath them in every respect to the point that they actually sound amateurish in comparison.  No matter which of the three you choose, you can't really go wrong with any of them but I would really look no further than them as everything else is far beneath their legendary talents.  Enjoy!
B0002858YS|5.0|The BEST SONGS on this album aren't on the radio! I have to say that the most overlooked and the absolute most awesome song on this album is the first track \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\". It blew me away when I first heard it, and it was even better when I saw them live. The Killers are in the spotlight, and some of their songs are overplayed, but don't let that stop you from getting this tremendous album! Midnight Show is the finale to the \\"murder trilogy\\", (Jenny being part 1 and Mr Brightside being pt 2), and is my second favorite song on the album.. On Top is also stellar. Get this album now!
B00004BZ16|5.0|yes london calling and give em enough rope is good original punk, but the clash improved so much into SANDANISTA. I have the 3 album set, vinyl and i love it.

B000777J2S|1.0|If I was deaf, and I read Antony's lyrics, I would assume that this cd was a joke. <br />\\"And still you're coaxing me <br />To come on out and live <br />Well I'm a crippled dog <br />I've got nothing to give\\" <br />I would also assume that antony was a tormented pre-teen. <br /> <br />Now if I was miraculously cured of my hearing-impairment, and I heard Antony's music, the subsequent fit of laughter would probably kill me.
B00005JNEW|4.0|As I watched this film, I kept thinking about a recurring 'Married With Children' joke, \\"I played high school football for Polk High. I scored four touchdowns in one game.\\" If only one of the characters, like Al Bundy, sold women's shoes after graduation. Unlike this movie, the end of High school is not the end of life, but the beginning. If fifty-five thousand people have nothing better to do than go to a high school football game, as portrayed in this movie, three millenia of philosophy, literature,and art has been wasted on simple-minded dolts. Friday Night Lights illustrates how pathetic and shallow high school football and American culture is. Move on, please.
B0002U0UKS|5.0|Joe (or Jo) Hisaishi has composed the beautiful, ingenious music used in all of Hayao Miyazaki's animated films since 1984. The two understand one another in the same kind of classic collaboration that Tim Burton has with Danny Elfman; Miyazaki provides wonderful images that make the music resonate and deepen its meaning, and Hisaishi creates music that strengthens the imagery and the emotional connections in the artwork. Hisaishi's music continues to grow and flourish in \\"Howl's Moving Castle,\\" for which he creates a waltz theme (track 3 is perhaps the most moving) that captures the otherworldly, but still somehow English and Dutch, trappings of the film. Hisaishi's work is never less than moving, nor his work dependent on a film to carry it. It stands on its own as a composition of wondrous, captivating music.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I love this album! I perfer music like this rather than some of the gangsta rap that is out now. Being a male, I didn't think that I would be interested in getting this album, but when MTV kept on playing that little snippet of her song \\"Unbreakable\\" at the end of every MTV show, I was instently hooked onto Alicia Keys. Go buy this album, male or female. Just look how high this album ranks on the Amazon.com CD list. So far it ranks #6 out of what...a million?   P.S. My favorite song is Diary on this album!!! Holla!!!
0792151712|1.0|First of all may I address the hacks of Hollywood: CAN'T YOU PEOPLE SPELL ANY OTHER NAME BUT JACK??!!! Come on, it's the most overused name and it's in almost all the movies! I think there's a button on your word processors that spell \\"Jack\\" and all you have to do is press it and it will print it over and over in your script, kind of like the \\"F\\" word that you folks use in place of actual LANGUAGE! <br /> <br />It was bad enough that Cameron couldn't use as characters people who actuall LIVED; he had to go and invent the most BORING characters who ever ate up 16 hours of my time (well, it FELT like 16 hours!) <br /> <br />First of the casting! Leonardo DiCrapio looks like (and always will) an aging teen-ager. If Leo strained really, reeeeally hard, he might sprout a 5 hair mustache! He's just another of the aging boy types Hollywood is all agog about: Jude Law, Colin Farrell, Orlando Bloom and others. The only real adult male actor around today is Russell Crowe and he has totally karate chopped his career as brutally as he does hotel employees. <br /> <br />And Kate Winslet! Lord, in terrible need of an extreme makeover! Nose needs refining, body needs to drop 45 pounds at least! She looked more like the older girl next door than Leo's lover, or maybe like his sister which is incest and that's just eeeeewwwwww!! And the hair color on Winslet and her \\"mother\\" who bore absolute NO physical resemblance, but they tried to \\"fool\\" us by dousing both with Lady Clairol Un-natural Tangerine Red #45. <br /> <br />As for the excrutiatingly irritating \\"love story\\" that seemed to suck all the attention and lenghthen this stupid movie, listen up all you ditsy teen-age girls. Here's what really happened if Jack had lived: <br /> <br />Jack and Rose run away to New York to live by the sea... in a cardboard shack with a corrugated tin roof. Since Rose has STUPIDLY put love above security and Billy N.Zane's (well, that's the characters he plays!) millions of bucks, she's paying for it now. <br /> <br />She's had one kid, added another 60 pounds and has another Little Leo in the oven. New York summers are very HOT and humid,especially if you live in a hot tin box. Leo never comes home from the bar where he hangs with his mates because the big cow beats him up for not working to give her the rich life she almost had. Unfortunately there are no phones, so she can't call up Billy N.Zane and beg him to let her come back, but Billy's into appearances and doesn't want a fat broad on his arm who has un-natural orange hair and is breast-feeding!  But I think Billy mercifully drowned before he had to endure to the end of this dreadful flick. I don't know, don't remember, don't care. <br /> <br />So to make ends meet, Rose must scrounge aluminum cans so she and the little King Of The World won't starve.So much for Happily Ever After. <br /> <br />This is reality girls, so make this movie a lesson in life! Go for the money! <br /> <br />Now as for the title of this review, if I'd had a dollar for each time Rose was screaming Jack, I'd have paid this month's mortgage! And why was she, with the generous body fat, floating on the raft/door when the skinny meatless squirt was in the ice water? You'd think she'd have taken turns. I was hoping someone would just shove Leo into the water so she'd stop yelling \\"Jack, Jack, Jack.....!\\"like yelling your name in your face will keep you from freezing.  <br /> <br />And dropping the big jewell into the ocean??! WHAT? ARE YOU CRA-ZEEEEEE??!! Absolutely no way! You think Jack is down there alive thanking you?? No, put that baby in the bank for nine decades, draw interest, if you don't want the money, give it to the victims of Hurricane Katrina for God's sake! Sheesh, this movie just got dumber as it went along. <br />    <br />Anyway, my 2 cents and this could have been good if it had only stuck to what really happened. Maybe someday someone will make this story correctly.
B000002I25|5.0|I don't usually like classic rock. I'm into Punk, some metal, a bit of Grunge, and  Hard Rock. This album is groundbreaking, I think it lead to the reballious Punk rock acts of the late seventies (the Ramones, The Clash, and of course the Sex Pistols) this is classic rock at it's best. buy buy buy!!!!!!!!!!!
B000007WNN|5.0|This album is so simple musically, but full of so much emotion and energy.  The recording is stripped down and mixed in wallace fashion with heavy bass drums, hi hats.

B0007P3582|1.0|hip hop is so gay, i don't see why it's so popular. Rap used to stand for something back in the ninetys, now it's all about stars and their cars. Any one listening to this is probably some twelve year old thinking he knows good music, or some faggy little skateboarder who lip sycs to the fresh lyrics of this jackass or that retard Kanye West. P.S the dancing in Hip hop videos look so gay, everyone will notice this by 2006, I gaurantee.

B0000022WA|5.0|Haley Mills plays twin sisters Sharon McKendrick and Susan Evers, separated at birth by their parents divorce.  When they both end up by chance at the same summer camp, sparks fly before they realize they're sisters.  But after they figure that out they hatch a plot to switch places to get their parents back together.  Of course, once the switch is uncovered they need to be un-switched, and complicating their plans is the surprise upcoming wedding of the father.<br /><br />I remember watching this as a kid and howling with laughter at the antics at summer camp, and again during the camping trip near the end.  It still remains one of my all-time favorite movies, and my kids love watching it with me every once in a while.  I've seen the remake Disney made a few years back, but it has nowhere near the charm the original has.  The split-screen special effects may not be entirely seamless, but it works well enough, and is a fun movie.

B0006L16N8|2.0|Am I the only one here that is disappointed with this effort from Coldplay?  So I admit, this is a decent album, but not anywhere close to the level of \\"Parachutes\\" or even \\"Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  The album is different from any of their predecessors and definitely has a more rocking U2 quality to it.  For some, this may be a positive aspect, but if I wanted to listen to U2 I wouldn't buy a Coldplay album.  Chris Martin and Coldplay are definitely not one of the greatest bands of all time and I believe this album was almost written by them to tribute themselves. The best song is \\"Fix You\\", this is because it actually is somewhat reminiscent of their previous work on \\"Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  \\"Speed of Sound\\" is basically a rip off of \\"Clocks\\", I honestly cannot even tell the difference between the two.  While listening the whole time I was hoping to hear them mellow out and go back to their roots. I recently saw them live, and while their performance was good, they had this huge light show which was totally unnecessary and overdone.  Not to mention since they are playing multiple shows all shows will be the exact same.  This band has just gotten \\"too big\\" and it's seriously gone to their heads.  I recommend buying \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"Rush of Blood\\", but if you're a true fan and not just jumping on the Coldplay bandwagon you should be disappointed with this release.  Also, the Johnny Cash song is ok but too strange for me to truly appreciate.  As I mentioned in the heading, this album is just overrated, overproduced garbage.  Due to a few halfway decent songs which are listenable, I will give this 2 stars.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have owned this CD for a couple of months now.  I hadn't really heard anything about 'Tool' until I was reading a review of Alice in Chains/Dirt and they made the comparison of that album and this one.  My very next action was to get to Ebay and bid on this.  It has been one of my very best choices so far!  I want to agree with \\"cflynn\\" about Christians and this music.  I would like to add that the emotions shared by Tool on this album are shared by ALL of us at one time or another.   There is no reason to fear this music (unfortunately many many Christians live their lives out of a fear motivation, which is very sad), this is different from anything else in my music collection, and it gets WAY more than its share of playing time.  My taste in music is probably as diverse as anyone on here (check out the HUGE differences in the music that I've already reviewed), and I can enthusiastically recommend this CD to any true lover of music.  Beware that this may become addictive to some!  Get it, listen with an open mind, and enjoy!!! <br />
B000ASATWQ|5.0|In 2005, an already fantastic year for hiphop releases, this stands out as the best. Easily. Best album since Kanye's College Dropout. When's the tour and who is opening? Bobby Brown? Yammobethere mon!
B0009DBXXG|5.0|Almost a year ago I was away on a one week photo workshop. After a few days our teacher treated us to this dvd while saying that \\"this is to show you that real artists also struggle to achieve what they want. They are not merely superstars that always can deliver at the tip of a hat\\".......... The film started and we watched the great ensemble of artists giving their all to get the best possible result out of the recording sessions. I have to say it was kind of encouraging for me to watch and to hearing a voice saying \\"take 132\\" while the great artists are getting ready to record. It shows that no man is infallible. We're getting a really interesting glimpse into how things are working when an artist is recording an album. I was sitting there watching and then came the clip where Carreras is singing Maria and my mouth just fell wide open. Something went \\"click\\" in my head and it's possible that my heart skipped a beat too and I was completely hooked on this absolutely beautiful voice. The first thing I did when returning back home was to order a copy of this dvd and then I started checking out Jos Carreras and at the moment I'm the proud and delighted owner of a substantial opera collection - all of them of course with Carreras singing the tenor role.    This dvd is showing us clips from rehearsals and recording sessions as well as some brief comments from the singers about how they feel about working with Bernstein; Troyanos and Te Kanawa are talking about their \\"connection\\" to the music of West Side Story and of course we have the more or less (in)famous episode where Carreras is cut of in the middle of \\"Maria\\" and someone is saying that this was the end of the session and they have to continue the next day. Carreras, who obviously had worked a lot to get into the right mood to sing this song, in addition to the tension because of a vital top G still not recorded, gets cut of and reacts in a very natural way, I think. He utters a few words in Spanish; (not sayinganything nice, I guess) collects his notes and then storms out of the studio. However, the next day he returns in resplendent voice and delivers his top note without any seemingly problems.....     It's also really fun watching the recording of \\"America\\" where the artists in addition to Bernstein himself are literally dancing around the studio. I just love watching this. I especially love the look on the face of one of the singers when the song ends; you can see the satisfaction just glowing, because she knows they have pulled it off perfectly.    There are lots of things I could say about this dvd, but I don't want to spoil all the fun for those who haven't watched it yet. What I can say is that this is a \\"spirited\\" injection for all those people out there struggling to achieve something, in addition to being a wonderful testament to Bernstein and his music as well as the musicianship of Carreras, Te Kanawa and the late Tatia Troyanos. Don't miss this opportunity to watch real geniuses at work......    PS. I just have to add that \\"my\\" workshop ended with almost all the participants going around singing \\"I feel pretty\\", becuase we felt that we had triumphed at last, and I can tell you that this song is really \\"contagious\\"....
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This is one concert I truly would have liked to have gone to. I chatted with someone who went to the concert. She said that the people there who were mostly those who where around when Cream played Royal Albert Hall in 1968. On the audience shots, I saw plenty of younger people, so it looks as if Cream does indeed transcend generations. I myself know a few younger people who are into Cream.  <br /> <br />If you aren't familiar Cream you should go out, get this CD and DVD and see what all the fuss was about then, and why the fuss is starting out again. Cream was the first supergroup and years after they dissolved and went onto to different things, their music still stood out on the airwaves. Who hasn't heard White Room, Badge, Sunshine of Your Love or Crossroads?  <br /> <br />I purchased both the CD and the DVD. Let me tell you: if you've been waiting for an excuse to buy a home theater system, this is it. The DVD is absolutely fantastic. I just have a small 14 inch (I'm not an extremely materialistic person) but even on that the concert was just fantastic. It's also got me thinking about buying a big screen TV and a home theater system. That's going to have to wait, I think!  <br /> <br />I'm going to concentrate mainly on the DVD, mostly because it's a complete experience. It was filmed in HD, stereo and 5.1 Surround Sound, so you can just imagine how sweet the experience is.  <br /> <br />You don't have to spend a lot bens either. I purchased the DVD at Costco for $18.49 and the CD at Best Buy for $18.99. One great thing for you vinyl fans: it was released on high performance vinyl as well.  <br /> <br />And now for the music. I decided to do a song by song commentary. No particular reason.  <br /> <br />I'm so glad What a great start. It really gets you hyped up and ready for the rest of the concert. Drums and vocals are just fantastic.  <br /> <br />Spoonful Originally performed by Willie Dixon around 1960. This song has the unusual quality of being both raw and polished at the same time. The solos are just long enough, but still there is a small, intimate club feel when listening to this song. It's like you are sitting in a small smoky club late at night nursing your Maker's Mark while you kicked off your shoes and are leaning back in your chair, eyes closed, just groovin' with the band. Great blues.  <br /> <br /> <br />Outside woman blues What can say, other than that I listened to it three times in a row.  <br /> <br />Pressed Rat and Warthog Oh, I love Ginger Baker's voice. Ginger usually adds some outrageous facial expressions but this rendition was rather straightforward. It's still great. And I do hope Pressed Rat and Warthog reopens soon.  <br /> <br />Sleepy Time Time How I love this song. The bonus cut, I think is even better. It's slow, rockin' blues at it's best.  <br /> <br />N.S.U. This just rocks. That's all there is to say.  <br /> <br />Badge Everything comes together in this song. This is one of those songs that gets my car radio turned up full blast and annoys all the drivers in a five block radius.  <br /> <br />Politician What a song. It's like Jack Bruce seduces the audience.  <br /> <br />Sweet wine Hypnotic, and really hits home near the end when the lyrics pick up.  <br /> <br />Rollin' and Tumblin' I absolutely love that harmonica and drum combo. Vocals are great. Now this is blues tune to dance to!  <br /> <br />Stormy Monday God, this is good. It done by T-Bone Walker originally, and I think he'd be very happy to hear what Cream has done with his song.  <br /> <br />Deserted cities of the heart I love this song, it just makes me melt.  <br /> <br />Born under a bad sign Originally by Booker T. Jones. Fantastic. That's all there is to say. This is one song that got my stereo cranked up to the max.  <br /> <br />We're going wrong Jack is wonderful here. Listening to his voice and having Eric's guitar so hot at the same time is just magic. Throughout it, you can hear Ginger's drumming - just heaven. I replayed this at this at least five times, the last one with a great glass of cabernet. It's a song to just put the earphones on, sit back in your favorite chair and get lost in the music.  <br /> <br />Crossroads Classic, classic, classic. What more can I say? First done by Robert Johnson; if you don't know who is, you should because he is probably the greatest American Bluesman EVER and he definitely has left his mark in both blues and rock. Of course that's my personal opinion. Someone should make a movie of his all too short life. (Hey,Chris Thomas King, are you listening? You'd be good in the role. A little sideline here, which explains why I think he'd be great in the roll. If you saw Oh Brother Where Art Thou, the character of Tommy Johnson was played by Chris Thomas King and it was based on the legend of Robert Johnson at the crossroads.  <br /> <br />White room Pure Heaven It's incredible. I couldn't help getting up and dancing!  <br /> <br />Toad This is just a masterpiece. Baker's solo drumming is hypnotic at one point. IMHO, no one can do a drum solo better than Ginger Baker! At the end it feels like a gigantic fireworks explosion!  <br /> <br />Sunshine of your love Probably the classic of all the Cream songs, followed closely by White Room and Crossroads. Oh my god. How fantastic! Best cut? I think so.  <br /> <br />Sleepy time time (bonus track) I like this one better than the first. It has a soul of its own.  <br /> <br />The DVD has two more additional bonus tracks: We're Going Wrong and Sunshine of your love.  <br /> <br />If you are forced to choose between either the CD or DVD, choose the DVD. Aside from the extra bonus tracks, there are interviews with Ginger, Jack and Eric, plus you get to see the stage with the computer generated lightshow. It's based on Chet Helm's Family Dog Productions at the Fillmore.  <br /> <br />I do have some minor complaints. I would have liked expanded liner notes myself. And I had to get a magnifying glass toread the insert, butI guess that's more part of aging than anything else. You know, on the CD cover (less on the DVD) they were very creative with the colors. If you take a magnifying glass, and tilt the cover slightly, under the right light it looks three dimensional. Look for the blue and yellows to pop out the most. Groovy, man.  <br /> <br />So, will Cream attract a new group of followers and will they tour again? There is concert in New York at Madison Square Garden on October 24, 25, and 26. If you can, go! You will have a great experience. It would be great if young music lovers \\"discover\\" Cream. It would be nice if they did some new material, but reunion concerts are fine too. It will be interesting to see what they decide to do after New York.  <br /> <br />I know some people who think Cream was just a short term experiment for the three before they went on to their \\"real\\" careers. I think they are totally wrong. Even if Cream only lasted two short years their influence on rock was undeniable, and even today Cream's music stands on its own.  <br /> <br />Crossposted at wavesoflight.blogspot.com
B000AQBA1W|5.0|What can we say about an album of traditional irish songs performed by the Corrs? This is a \\"wish come true\\" to every fan of the band, especially for those who always search on the pop songs of the Corrs theirs irish backgrounds. This album is very well produced, with beautiful traditional arrangements for the songs and inspiring lyrics. The first track is the outstanding \\"My lagan love\\", with violin & tin whiste solos, played by Sharon and Andrea. \\"Spancill Hill\\" is like a tale about the return of an irish man to the place where he was born,where he meets old neighbours, friends, the old bridge  and his first love. \\"Peggy Gordon\\" is a love poem, related to someone who loves, but is not loved back.\\"Black is the colour\\" is my favorite song of \\"Home\\". Andrea declares her love in a very submisive way, loving the ground he walks and waiting for the day when she and her loved one will become ONE. \\"Heart like a wheel\\" is another highlight on this album, very traditional. \\"Buachaill On Eirne\\" and \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" are sang in gaelic, with translation to english on the CD booklet. \\"Old Town\\", already presented on MTV Unplugged album, returns on \\"Home\\", with a renewed studio version. \\"Moorlough Shore\\" and \\"Dimming of the day\\" also deserve to be praised. Don't think twice. Pick up you copy and bring \\"Home\\" a real irish songbook!   <br /> <br />

B0002OOUP0|5.0|The Rolling Stones are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time. That's not an opinion. It's a fact. However, as with many great rock and roll bands, the reputation of the self proclaimed Greatest Rock And Roll Band In The World is being eaten away by a number of unneccessary greatest hits collections that add nothing to, if not take away from, their rich legacy.<br /><br />In 2002, the two cd set \\"Forty Licks\\" was released. That 40 song collction was the the ideal set for a casual Stones fan, and it seemed as if us harcore fans did not have to endure any more unneccessary greatest hits packagaes.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />On August 24, 2004, a new compilation called \\"Jump Back: The Best Of The Rolling Stones 1971-1993\\" was released. Or was it? \\"Jump Back\\" is anything but a new Stones compilation. I wore out at least three copies of it before it was (re?)released last year. And unlike the reissue of Queen's very first greatest hits collection that was released a week before \\"Jump Back\\", there is nothing axdded. No enhancements, no bonus tracks, just a digital remastering job and some new packaging. Other than that, it's essentially the same cd released back in the 1990s'.<br /><br />So why such a high rating? Simple. If you're a fan whose only interested in having all of The Rolling Stones' later hits, this is an ideal collection. All the later hits are here, including \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Start Me Up\\", \\"Angie\\", \\"Miss You\\", \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" and \\"Mixed Emotions\\", as well as some minor hits like \\"Hot Stuff\\", \\"Respectable\\", \\"Bitch\\", and \\"Rock And A Hard Place\\". Plus, the songs have been given a spruce digital remastering job, so they sound better than ever.<br />I'm actually going to agree with another reviewer and say this cd gives a more concise overview of the latter half of the band's career than the second disc of \\"Forty Licks\\" (which is awesome in its own right because of the four new songs).<br /><br />It is not, however, the perfect anthology of the band's later years. Bona fide Stone classics like \\"Sister Morphine\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\", \\"Heartbreaker (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo)\\", \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\", \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\", \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\", \\"Memory Motel\\", \\"She's So Cold\\", \\"Neighbors\\", \\"Little T & A\\", and \\"One Hit (To The Body)\\". Plus, the collection only goes up to 1989's \\"Steel Wheels\\", not 1993. Thoygh they didn't release the followup to \\"Steel Wheels\\" (\\"Voodoo Lounge\\") until 1994, they could've at least thrown on maybe some live versions of the old songs or the two studio tracks from the live album \\"Flashpoint\\" (\\"Highwire\\" and \\"Sex Drive\\"). Other than those flaws, \\"Jump Back\\" is an ideal collection for fans of only The Rolling Stones' later material.sics like \\"Sister Morphine\\", \\"Dead Flowers\\", \\"Heartbreaker (Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo)\\", \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\", \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\", \\"Cherry Oh Baby\\", \\"Memory Motel\\", \\"She's So Cold\\", \\"Neighbors\\", \\"Little T & A\\", and \\"One Hit (To The Body)\\".

1400031362|5.0|Oh, dear!  I'm nearing the end of the series!!!  Mr. McCall, please write another one quick!  Mma Romatswe has become a friend I don't want to lose!  This is the best series since Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys!  Fit for all ages of readers 14-100!  Oh, if we were all like Mma ... what a wonderful world it would be!
0143034901|5.0|I wont recap the plot as that has already been done but I did want to say that this is a rare find.  I could not put it down unitl I finished.  Its a page turner from start to finish without the typical cookie cutting ending that often ruins mystery novels.<br /><br />I hope to see more from this author in english soon.
B0000931OG|5.0|While it took a while to get used too, (ive been a big Blur fan for some time now) I do believe that this album is one of Blurs strongest. My highest recommendation.
0375432302|5.0|It was awesome, inspiring and inspired a desire to investigate further symbologies and other rituals taken for granted over the years.
B00003CXMG|5.0|For a long time, I thought that this was another one of those silly romantic comedies - afterall, that was the section it was in.  I thought, why bother with another coming of age movie that will end up stupidly happy, with the wrong lessons, and puerily unrealistic.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong on that one!!  This is a wonderful, sensitive film that develops a number of themes:  finding a mentor, making your first foray into the world, discovering what (relative) failures most of us are as people, and of course, the decline of rock in the 1970s.  Not only was the psychology of the characters subtle and realistic, but the evocation of the time - when the 60s idealism gave way to crass commercialism and, well, genuine mediocrity - is vivid and accurate.<br /><br />I am almost the exact same age as the protagonist, so I identified with him on many levels:  rebelling against a parent he loved to go his own way, accomplishing something original by getting inside with his own talent and gall, and seeing the people behind the idols of cool.  It is amazingly successful at all this, and for kids there is a lot to learn from it.  Heck, even I re-wrote my life somewhat while enjoying this adventure of youth!  It is lovely, sad, and uplifting.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  This is a great director.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I love the way this movie turns traditional sci-fi movies upside-down by breaking cliches left and right, while still being exciting and, most of all, making you care about the characters. Probably the best part is the humor. I can't remember the last time I saw real, genuine humor in a sci-fi movie. Even the Hitch-hiker's movie fell short in that regard. Serenity's humor is based in the characters, so it rings true. The movie also jumps so quickly between laughter and pathos and back again that you really need to hold on to your seat. A great adventure-- A movie to make you excited about movies again.
B000929AJQ|5.0|great... in my view....simply great <br /> <br />tracks like all the love in the world give it a new feel then all the other NIN albums i have heard and my fav track is definitely Every day is exactly the same.  Just such pure emotion that is more clearly defined then all Trent's other albums
B00000DCH9|4.0|Billy Joel's follow-up to his incredible debut \\"Cold Spring Harbor\\", is a step down, but not much.  Some of the songs sound a little more like filler material than the great album tracks that would follow on his later albums.  The songs on here that are good, however, are among his very best. <br /> <br />1.  Travelin' Prayer-2/5.  This is one of his absolute worst songs ever.  It's very country and bluegrass flavored, very fast-paced with not very good lyrics or vocal delivery. <br />2.  Piano Man-5/5.  Billy Joel's signature song.  The lyrics are typical Billy Joel, the music and vocals are superb.  If you have any knowledge of 1970's rock music, you know this song.   <br />3.  Ain't No Crime-3/5.  Very bluesly.  Not one of the better songs on the album. The lyrics are okay and the vocal delivery is good, but this sounds too much like a filler song. <br />4.  You're My Home-4/5.  Very good album track with a slow country flavor to it.  Lyrics are very good, the vocal delivery is superb. <br />5.  The Ballad of Billy Kid-4/5.  Very cinematic song about the legend of Billy the Kid.  The last verse switches it to Joel being Billy the Kid.  Music has an epic, cinematic feel to it, with great vocals. <br />6.  Worst Comes To Worst-3/5.  Another filler song.  Very bouncy, goofy sounding music.  Lyrics aren't very good, but the vocals are. <br />7.  Stop In Nevada-3/5.  Another filler track.  Similar to \\"Worst Comes To Worst.\\"  Good vocals with not so good lyrics and so-so music. <br />8.  If I Only Had the Words (To Tell You)-5/5.  This is one of the best songs on the album.  Music and lyrics are superb.  Vocal delivery is perfect.  A great love song that will make your heart swell. <br />9.  Somewhere Along the Line-4/5.  A good song with great lyrics and vocals.  Mid-paced with a country feel to it.  A good song. <br />10.  Captain Jack-5/5.  One of Billy Joel's best songs ever.  Great music and vocals with Joel's typical cynical lyrics.  The lyrics are a little racy,especially for 1973, but they are excellent.  A superb song. <br /> <br />All in all, it's not Billy Joel's best album, but it's not his worst either.  For a casual fan, it is not recommended.  For Joel fans, it is obviously a must have, because there a great songs on here that cannot be found on any greatest hits package.
0375757422|3.0|Yes, that's how I feel about the book. I absolutely LOVE Pride & Prejudice and Northanger Abbey, so I thougt: time to re-read Emma. And boy did I have to push myself to finish it ! Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring. <br /> <br />But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice. If that is what life was like for a lot of high class girls in the early 19th century, than I am so gratefull that I'm born at the end of the 20th century !!! Miss Bates monologues were kinda funny the first few times, but after that... The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies. <br /> <br />We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good. <br /> <br />Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences. Of course, we still have them, but it is not like they cannot mix, these days. Or that we still have those rules about visiting and inviting. or at least nog were I live.
B000B5IPLK|2.0|She has the looks and the personality for this industry but this Unplugged Album does not show-case her vocal ability.  She needs to grow vocally and she hasn't yet.  \\"Unbreakable\\" sucks.  Too chessy.  I was expecting her to really vocally step up her game but she can't.  I give this album 2 stars just for effort only.  Expected more from her vocally.  MTV is happy however, instant cash.  The music industry thinks we are dumb.  She needs to work on her lack of indentity, vocal range, and originality.
0689835604|3.0|My son is 14 months and he really likes this book.  We have lost a few of the flaps because the flaps are thin and difficult for a 14 month old to lift.  My son has points to his body parts when we read this book together.  Over all it's a fun book to read with your child.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I am in my early fifties and don't mind admitting that my 19 year old got me hooked on the OC last year in their 1st season. <br />Bought series 1 for her birthday and again this year bought her the second series.  We watch the reruns together and watch the third season every thursday evening.  I especially liked the so called bloopers included in the 2nd season DVD, it was not a part of series 1 so this behind the scenes filming mishaps were comical and thoroughly enjoyable.  I would rate this DVD 5 stars.
B0002858YS|5.0|this is a great CD and my kids love it too.  we fight over who's going to get to use it first!
B000002H2H|1.0|As a bass player myself, i study and look up to bass players in rock/metal for inspiration. One of my teachers reccomended i check out this album becaues this guy called Cliff Burton is on it and that he was one of the more popular bass players. <br /> <br />Let me just say that this guy is very overrated in the music circles. 'Ride The Lightning' would get about 3 stars b/c it is a decent metal album, but Cliff would get no stars at all, talk about one of the most hyped up bass players known to man. I'v heard better bassists in Nu Metal, and i utterly hate Nu Metal.  <br /> <br />Lets get this strait right now, this drug-addict was no Steve Harris, Geddy Lee or Geezer Butler. <br /> <br />I looked up the bass tabs for some of these songs and just laughed. I don't know how Burton was ever considered good at all, he has very simple bass lines much like Gene Simmons or Cliff Williams, but those two have about 10 times the talent that Burton had. I'm starting to think that it is all just hype behind what Cliff Burton was, or could actaully do. Just one more overrated notch under the belt of the machine known as Metallica. They use his death as an excuse as to why Metallica is no good anymore, maybe that is why is is so overhyped and worshipped. <br /> <br />Cliff Burton was essentially the Kurt Cobaine of bass, extremely untalented and oversimplistic, yet highly revered and lauded for no real reason at all. <br /> <br />If you wan't to hear some REAL bassists go listen to: <br /> <br />Timi Grabber* Mercyful Fate <br />Steve Harris* Iron Maiden <br />Geezer Butler* Black Sabbath <br />Markus Grosskompf* Helloween <br />Jimmy Bain* Rainbow, Thin Lizzy, Dio <br />Geddy Lee* Rush <br />Dan Lilker* Anthrax, S.O.D., Nuclear Assault, Brutal Truth <br />Peter Baltes* Accept <br />Angle Ripper* Sodom <br />Flea* Red Hot Chili Peppers <br />Jeff Pilson* Dokken, Dio <br />Rudy Sarzo* Ozzy, Quiet Riot, Dio <br />Bob Daisley* Vinnie Moore, Rainbow, Ozzy, Black Sabbath, ect <br /><br />Man, there are so many more that could wipe their @$$es with Cliff Burton, but Amazon only has a 1000 word limit so i will leave it at that.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I would give this CD 10 stars if I could. Awesome CD - the entire CD is fantastic, not just a few songs.  Great artists - it's my favorite CD right now.
B000089CJI|4.0|Everytime I listen to this album I enjoy it. It is good on so many levels for me. Music, Singing, lyrics all are very good. They have the talent to be great.
0743454537|4.0|This was a great book. I loved how you got to see the situations from everyones viepoint. I definitely did not see the end coming. I thought it was a great ending though even if it was sad. This book eally makes you appreciate your family and the time you have with them.
1577314808|1.0|Beyond the first few lines it's a load of waffled gobbledygook. If you want something excellent about meditation buy: Angel Tech by Antero Alli, Prometheus Rising by Robert Anton Wilson, and Undoing Yourself... by Christopher S. Hyatt.
B000ASATYO|2.0|I put 2 stars only because this DVD is announced as a single disc. I'm wondering if this DVD is really single disc. Because I have some embarrasing informations about Japanese DVD. <br /> <br />According to the Universal Pictures Japan's official website, they are going to release \\"The Frighters: Special Edition\\" on 12/23 as 3-DISC SET which includes OVER 4.5 HRS of extras. <br />As far as I can tell, the extras in Disc 2-3 appear to be the same documentary found in \\"Signature Collection\\" laserdisc, which is described on a website in details by some fan who owns it. <br /> <br />However, Japanese DVD has some downside. The movie itself is listed as 110 mins. To my understanding DC is 122 mins. (But Amazon lists US DVD as 110 mins above.) <br />Also, while \\"introduction by Peter Jackson\\" to extras is listed, audio commentary is not mentioned. <br /> <br />If all these are correct, it's very embarassing. Why don't they release DC of the movie with complete extras together, in every country? <br /> <br />I really hope US DC edition has full length documentary. <br />Otherwise I'm going to have to buy both of US & Japanese editions.
0743455967|5.0|Thumbs-In-Vest Earned In Every Effort.<br /><br />Leave it to Stephen King to write one of the few books I could recommend on writing, without fearing that, in doing so, I would be damning a potentially creative individual. As a bonus, King recommends my standby reference on writing, \\"Elements of Style,\\" by William Strunk Jr. & E.B. White.<br /><br />Leave it to King, The Master, to write this semi-autobiographical expose on authorship craft in a more intriguingly unique organizational setup than anyone else could conjure or dare. Leave it to Him to force (or else) a (sort of) \\"how to\\" book into mesmerizing entertainment; to step into the job with a horrific grab about a kid suffering ear drum puncture; and to coerce an anomaly of styles and content to coalesce into a gestalt of genius which WORKS, period.<br /><br />How can a book on writing be riveting?? Read it and see.<br /><br />King includes only those riveting parts of his personal history which have contributed to his writing career. He includes only the necessary elements to \\"teach\\" how to spark and stir creative fires. He includes only the necessary keys to his success (amazingly, he does know what those keys are).<br /><br />I was impressed with King's exposure of his method of writing from a SITUATION rather than from a precise PLOT outline; I still find myself chewing on that daring technique (though I do still appreciate a strongly plotted story).<br /><br />I was interested in his examples of bad and good prose, and agree with his praise of other works, though I reserve judgment on a few of his criticisms, and have developed techniques to take breaks whenever I need them without permanently losing a creative flow, which I can renew at almost any point if I can set up the right conditions.  (When I break through with as many Number One Best Sellers as Mr. King has, maybe my opinion on writing will be as viable as his.)<br /><br />King has many times earned the right to have an opinion on writing and to offer it for sale. Yet, he has approached this project with genuine humility, which is, to me, endearing (sorry about the sentimental slip, Oh Master of Horror).<br /><br />What do I admire most about this author, which is evident in this book? I absolutely enjoy his regenerating honesty, his uncanny originality, and his demand of himself to toss reader boredom into a black hole and perform, within his printed words, 24/7 without fail. Also love the way he sincerely and humbly exposes his respect for his wife.<br />Given what this man has endured and accomplished in his life, he's earned the best type of REST available to a human being, and I don't mean the big \\"D.\\" He deserves to be quite proud of himself. He deserves to have his thumbs permanently posed in the sides of a vest, to sit back and smile at his trail of effort and result.<br /><br />What a gift that he would attempt in earnest to share his secrets of writing success. And his uncanny self-awareness allowed him to share clearly what those secrets are, in this valuable gift for the youngest as well as the most seasoned of writers. This I say as a 2 decades professional writer and previous English and creative writing teacher who has published various articles and finished and polished 8 fiction manuscripts and has another 8 + book-length works in progress.  I'm not EVEN near King's level in the marketplace (yet), but I am a highly productive creative spirit who knows how to maintain, ride, and design the flow.<br /><br />There's always more than one way to approach any creative endeavor, and my approach to writing is similar to King's in some ways, somewhat different in other ways (I can only compare, of course, to the content offered in this book).  This insight to King's techniques exposes what works for him and what could work for other, though of course not all creative spirits.  Young writers should allow themselves leeway in deciding how to tap and work with their talents.  Creativity should be allowed to flourish, even when establishing a personal method on how to use that force, and sometimes it's necessary to forge a unique path diverging from even the greatest masters.  When I was teaching creative writing in the public school systems, I asked my students to at least try some of the established methods of writing prior to setting any of them aside to break away from them.<br /><br />Another great book which exposes a writer's path and techniques (through a novel rather than through a unique how to book) is THE NOVEL by James A. Michener.  See my review.<br /><br />What I believe On Writing has exposed better than many writing \\"how to\\" books is tapping into the Right Brain.  As I've observed the styles of many authors of novels, they each seem to be almost \\"designed\\" by DNA to work in different precise balances of Right/Left Brain.  The Left Brain wants steps, plots, outlines, plans and structure to be elaborately perfect prior to that leap into the ozone.  The pure Right Brain wants only the chaos of riding a storm of the absolute unknown, describing it as it explodes into the presence of present time, constantly changing, churning.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, telling a fledgling writer how to do it is, for me, a frightening extension of my uniqueness, because I would not ever want to hamper the growth of a maverick creative source needing by its design to walk a path not taught by any master before him.  Possibly every \\"how to\\" book should carry a warning.<br /><br />This one enters the effort in fairness, with humility and honesty, and does not say or imply, \\"This is THE only way to write.\\"<br /><br />Thank you, Stephen, for sharing your personal and professional views on writing, which expose your adept use of both sides of the brain, highlighting your ability to slip into the quirks of the Right side in intriguingly clear ways.  Not all writers can explain how that slip into the ozone happens.  Great books have been produced with various balances of Left & Right.

B0000AQS6R|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and we consider it a *relatively* new classic.  Unfortunately, though, there are a couple of scenes that have unnecessary sexual undertones (or overtones?), and one scene where profanity is used in an excessive manner. The great thing about DVD's is you can skip those unwanted scenes.  For the most part, though, we really enjoy the movie because it shows the joy in family Christmases together.  It also reminds us that we all have our own *challenges* with family.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Alicia keys never ceaes to amaze me with her ability to take a song and put a new twist on it.  A prime example is the grammy version of If I Aint Got You.  In this album she does that with many of her well known songs and throws some new ones into the mix wonderfully.  You can tell by the way she performs and interacts with the audience on the set that the smaller the space the more she seems to shine.  The smaller intimate places is where he work shows best, so the unplugged setting fits her perfectly.  This album might be her best work to date and a preview of things to come.  Excellent set by her with suprising twists on old and new tracks.  Highly reccomended album for anyone.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|I was waiting for this album. She is hands down the best live performer on the planet today. This album however does nothing to reflect that. The new arrangement of \\"Fallin\\" does not work. \\"Unbreakable\\" is one of the most god-awful songs of this year. A few of the songs are also not in full-length, such as \\"You Don't Know my Name\\", \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\" & \\"Diary\\". They are missing verses, bridges and what not. \\"Wild Horses\\" & \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" are nice. I would not recommend this album though, just seems to much is missing.
B000001FGG|4.0|As a Cream fanatic myself, I have to say that this album is still far better than most albums out there, but overall, there isn't that much substance. I wasn't quite born yet in 1968, when WOF had its greatest impact. At the time, the entire concept was revolutionary: take one album of live material, one album of studio material and sell them together in a single package. It was a totally new idea that fit perfectly with Cream's two-way split personality: live and studio.     On vinyl, the album makes perfect sense. It flows well, and despite a couple of Baker stinkers, the studio album was great, and the live stuff was, well, beyond description. On CD, however, WOF loses its pacing. The second CD is only 44:22, and extra live tracks should have been included. I know that the Atlantic Tape Vault burned in 1975, but if an alternate version of \\"NSU\\" was unearthed for the TWTD box set in '97, then there certainly should be more live tracks sitting around somewhere. Otherwise, though, the music on the live CD is, of course, fantastic. The versions of \\"Crossroads\\" and \\"Spoonful\\" certainly make up 20:04 of some of the finest blues music ever made.      The studio album, however, pales in comparison to the live disc. Of course, there are the requisite classics \\"White Room,\\" \\"Politician,\\" \\"Sitting On Top,\\" and (of course) \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" the latter of which ended up being the most overlooked Cream track because it was never performed live and never had a chance to be made into a monolith like \\"Spoonful.\\" The tracks \\"As You Said,\\" \\"Those Were the Days,\\" and \\"Deserted Cities\\" are acceptably decent while the Baker originals \\"Passing the Time\\" and \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" simply haven't held up at all over the years. \\"Pressed Rat\\" especially is a stinker with Ginger reciting stoned-out poetry over a tepid pop-ish melody. Why they played this number at the RAH shows is beyond me.    However, even with WOF's flaws, it stands head-and-shoulders above most other rock albums. Why? Because Cream was one of the best bands on the planet, and even though they weren't as good at the RAH shows as they were 37 years ago (who would be), they still beat out every other blues and rock band currently together today. And I do have to say, the packaging on the CD version of this album is exquisite. So get it, right now.
B00006RAKP|3.0|To spend the extra cash for a 4-CD box set of nothing but hits and album cuts - as this collection represents - would make more sense. The songs on this package are great, if not Fantastic, and the collection is perfect for the Elton fan starter kit. But the inclusion / exclusion factor of songs, doesn't tell quite half the story of the John/Taupin legacy. <br /> <br />My home CD-R collection contains that 4-CD set and it doesn't go anywhere but with me no matter where I'm driving. Fact is, you CAN NOT sporadically place Elton John songs on two discs and expect to fit the last 32 (now 35 years) onto. <br /> <br />I think true Elton fans would go out of their way to purchase a monster box set of Elton's career wrapped up in a cool package of hits, b-sides, album cuts, photos and stories by Elton and Bernie. <br /> <br />I love you Elton, you are the earliest memory in my entire lifetime and some of my best years as a child. Many of us TRUE fans will be holding our breath for the ultimate package with all a fan would ever ask for. ANd please give me something better than these old Sony CD-R discs. I'll be the first in line!!!!
6304696566|5.0|What is The Great American Film? THE SEARCHERS has a claim to this title. Released at very nearly the midpoint of the American filmmaking experience (1956), directed by The Great American Director (John Ford), starring The Great American Actor (John Wayne), and filmed in The Great American Genre (The Western), THE SEARCHERS embodies American film as perhaps none other. But John Ford filmed other westerns starring John Wayne in the middle of the last century. What makes THE SEARCHERS stand out?<br /><br />THE SEARCHERS is an adult western which addresses themes largely absent in the genre up to that point: psychological conflict, racism, rape, and massacre. The film is far more violent than any other Ford western up to that point, and the line between hero and villain is blurrier. Disaster strikes early in this film, and the rest of the movie is a complex narrative about picking up those broken pieces that remain after such a tragedy. The epic timeframe of the movie allows complexity to seep into the characters realistically and believably.<br /><br />Most old-time westerns seem dated to me today; I grew up after the heyday of cowboy films. THE SEARCHERS is one of those rare movies, however that transcends not only its genre, but the decade in which it was made. A fan of classic cinema, I steered away from westerns for many years, not thinking them worthy of being considered great films. After viewing THE SEARCHERS, I knew that I was wrong. No library of classic American film would be complete without this movie.<br /><br />Jeremy W. Forstadt
B000AL730O|5.0|And that's the great thing about music, and art.  Paul McCartney is a recording artist; one who can create all types of \\"art\\"...silly stuff (English Tea), heavy stuff (Helter Skelter), danceable songs (Saw her standing there), quiet thoughtful songs (Mother Natures Son), even country songs (Sally G).  As such, someone will love it and someone will hate it, depending on the song.   <br /> <br />If 70% of people love the Mona Lisa, or Picasso, or Star Wars, that means 30% don't.  Presidents at the peak of popularity rarely exceed 65% approval ratings.  I love this CD, as do many others on this board.  But some people rate it as terrible.  Well, OK, we can disagree.  Some people on this board think Flowers in the Dirt is great; I think it's pretty bad.  Some people think this CD is bad; I think it's great.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, if you like the following Macca songs, you'll like this CD: <br /> <br />Martha My Dear <br />Blackbird <br />I Will <br />Lady Madonna <br />My Love <br />Put it There <br />Mother Nature's Son <br /> <br />If you only like Paul's uptempo rockers (Back in the USSR, Jet, I Saw her standing there, etc) this CD may disappoint.  You may rate it 1 star and ask what's wrong with Paul.  That's OK.  In 1967 when Dick Clark showed the Strawberry Fields promo film to his audience, and interviewed them afterward, it was 50-50 split.  Some loved it, some hated it.  \\"They look like old men.  What happened to my Beatles?\\".  So even a classic like Strawberry Fields was met with love it or hate it.  And so it goes!  In my book, this one's a great one.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|`Cream Royal Albert Hall London, May 2-6, 2005' is a long drink of cold water for those of us who discovered Cream with their release of their first album, `Fresh Cream' in 1966. They were both the first `supergroup' and the vangard of the second British invasion, lead primarily by members of lesser `first British invasion' bands such as the Spenser Davis Group, the Graham Bond Organization, Them, the Manfred Mann group, and the Yardbirds.<br /><br />Listening to this live performance which includes virtually all of their well-known numbers, it's surprising to realize that virtually all of their best-known numbers come from their first three albums, `Fresh Cream', `Disrali Gears', and `Wheels of Fire'. And, every one of the eighteen numbers on this album are longish versions of tracks from those three albums.<br /><br />Another surprising thing about Cream is that at least half of their best-known performances were not written by band members. Of these eighteen tracks, seven (`I'm So Glad', `Spoonful', `Outside Woman Blues', `Rollin'and Tumblin', `Stormy Monday', `Born Under a Bad Sign', `Crossroads') were written by great blues / R & B composers, seven (`Sleepy Time Time', `N.S.U', `Politician', `Deserted Cities of the Heart', `We're Going Wrong', `White Room', `Sunshine of Your Love') were written by Jack Bruce (with or without collaboration from others), three (`Pressed Rat & Warthog', `Sweet Wine', `Toad') were written by Ginger Baker, and one (`Badge') was written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison.<br /><br />Of these, the most distinctive Cream numbers are `I'm So Glad', `Spoonful', `Crossroads', `Born Under a Bad Sign', `White Room', and `Sunshine of Your Love'. This is probably a very subjective take on these 18 numbers, but compared to, for example, Traffic, where virtually all their numbers were written by Steve Winwood or other band members, this is a high proportion of borrowed material.<br /><br />The performances on this album are as good or better than any performances I recall from my vinyl copies from the 1960s. By some combination of the power of nostalgia, the strength of the three principals performances, and the live ambience of Royal Albert Hall, this is a truly powerful set. And, if the audience was treated to all 18 numbers in a single performance, that must have been a rare treat.<br /><br />As a live album, I would rate this high, almost, but not quite as high as The Who's `Live at Leeds' (for all his hype, Ginger Baker is still not as impressive a drummer as the much missed Keith Moon). I also may not rate it quite as high as `Frank Zappa, Filmore East, June, 1971.<br /><br />For as great a surprise as this album is, there are remarkably few notes on the circumstances surrounding the performance. I'm sure Eric Clapton didn't need the money, but Bruce and Baker may actually have suggested it as a sure moneymaker, especially when you add in a tour with astronomical ticket prices.<br /><br />This album unquestionably trumps any other Cream live albums and gives us performances which stand tall next to their original studio performances. In fact, it is remarkable that at least for the vocals, the performances are so close to the originals. If possible, I think Clapton's guitar and Bruce's harmonica performances are even stronger than the original.<br /><br />This album is a winner if you were there when Cream was fresh or if Cream is nothing more than a memory of a line on Eric Clapton's very long resume.better than any performances I recall from my vinyl copies from the 1960s.

0974153001|5.0|Well set out, this book takes you through all the basic & even more detail on modeling the human form in polymer Clay. Great for the beginner, I like the simple language & detailed discriptions & diagrams. Excellent!
B000AARKOO|5.0|I wish folks would stick to reviewing the movie rather than voicing thier opinions, or should I say trashing the religous faith of others.    In response to the idiot Mark A. Cartier who claims Christians bad, Muslims good. Congradulations upon your self appointed judgement seat over humanity. By the way note the correct spelling of Muslim..not Moslem.    I loved this movie. Not on religous ground but because Ridley Scott did such a tremendous job of delivering. It was beautiful, the music was top notch, and I thought the acting was great. I love war epics and this one kept me engaged throughout. It helped wash the bad taste Alexander had left.    The extras are nice also. I am a history buff, but am certainly no expert. I liked the A&E History vs. Hollywood extra on disc two. I know there was plenty of artistic liberties taken, so it was nice for balance sake.    I highly recommend this movie to those who liked Troy, Braveheart, The Last Samurai, and Gladiator. I wouldn't say it was better than any of those but held its own against them.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Ok.  As quirking, trippin', and wild as this movie is, let me make one observation.   IT IS A wELL SHOT MUSICAL!  THE UNION of camera and music is EXAMPLARY.  The music and what not are all OK, nothing particuarly timeless.  So why do I tell you this?  BECAUSE THE MOVIE-VERSION OF THE MOST POPULAR MUSICAL OF ALL TIME WAS MURDERED (FOR MORE REASON THAN ONE BUT) MAINLY BECAUSE IT WAS SHOT SO BADLY FOR A MUSICAL.
B000002A3T|4.0|Let it be known, first and foremost, that I would have given this 4.5 stars, but the option wasn't available...not the perfect cd that \\"Wish You were Here\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" were (which it sounds like a modernized combination of the two), but impressive none-the-less. <br /> <br />I remember when I first heard it - like Wish You were Here, much of it slipped right by me - t'was nice, but didn't grab me by the throat.  The playing is EXCELLENT, the production pristine, and Gilmours vocals are like syrup - smooth and aged to perfection. <br /> <br />I started listening to Pink Floyd at \\"The Wall\\", then consumed everything I could get my hands on.  Personally, the only cd's of theirs I don't really enjoy is \\"Obscured by Clouds\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\", \\"Umma Gumma\\" and the wretched failure of a Waters solo-trash called \\"The Final Cut\\".  That being said, this ranks in my top 5 PF cd's. <br /> <br />The songwriting is personal, witty, and interesting - the songs are deep and reward long-term repeated listening...pop it in, listen, then return to it in a week or two...rinse, repeat.  The longer I've owned it, the more I grew to love it. <br /> <br />I hope Pink Floyd have another in them - esp. with Rick Wright involved in the writing.  If Roger's in the fold, I hope they keep his singing to a minimum (his vocals at the \\"reunion\\" were a very sad display - made Robert Smith of the Cure sounds like an opera singer, or Bob Dylan like Maria Carey)...maybe he'll bring a bit more of a rock-opera edge to the songwriting, which wouldn't be a loss. <br /> <br />Anyway - long live Pink Floyd and classics like \\"The Division Bell\\".  To the future!
B000002G7E|5.0|Hawkwind used to propagate this theme they called Sonic Attack; they had a little poem thingy about it on 1973's SPACE RITUAL, and even released an entire album by that name in 1981.  Well, The Velvet Underground never bothered with such propagation; they just put out this slab of vinyl in 1967 called WHITE LIGHT WHITE HEAT and were done with it.  Yep, this is truly a sonic attack.  `Here She Comes Now' actually got a little airplay upon its release, but anyone who bought the album based on that brief song's mellow darkness was probably unprepared for the 17-plus-minute audio onslaught of `Sister Ray' or pretty much everything else here.  You want anti-social?  Sex?  Drugs?  Noise?  A headache?  A catharsis?  Look no further.  As for poor old Waldo Jeffers, well . . . that's just True Love's way.
B0000640SA|4.0|Excellent movie as long as you don't turn away from the screen. If you do, you will have no idea what has happened or is getting ready to happen. I happen to enjoy the way that each of the film's scenes tells a story unto itself. The ending was perfect. It kind of socked you right between the eyes and I love that kind of non-predictable, edgy side to this film. It was definitely not your average ho-hum drama. It was intense from start to finish. I highly recommend this film for anyone who is into edgy, dark drama.
B000002H1T|3.0|The Cars' blockbuster 1984 album, Heartbeat City, reached #3 on the 1984 Billboard Top 200 chart, and contained five hits, the biggest hit being \\"Drive\\", which reached #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and #3 on the Billboard Top 100. It was produced by \\"Mutt\\" Lange, who also produced several other 80s blockbuster albums like Pyromania- by Def Leppard and Back in Black - by AC/DC.<br /><br />While I like the hits on the album, especially \\"You Might Think\\", and also \\"Heartbeat City\\", the remaining album tracks are marred by overprocessed vocals and incessantly cheesy background vocals (for example, listen to \\"Stranger Eyes\\").  This album was basically both their commercial zenith and swan song, and the \\"new wave\\" that the Cars helped jumpstart was approaching its end in the mid-80s.
B000002H33|5.0|Great album as I've been told by so many people. Best thrash album, mature and loud! \\"Welcome Home Sanitarium,\\" \\"The Thing That Should Not Be,\\" \\"Battery,\\" and, of course, \\"Master of Puppets.\\" This sort of compiles much of what they used in \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and comes to together perfectly.    \\"Obey Your Master/Your Light Burns Faster  Master, MASTER!   Master of Puppets I'm pulling Your Strings   Twisting Your Mind and Smashing Your Dreams\\"    Awesome!
0446310786|5.0|I watched the movie many years ago, and I thought it was great (and it is), but the book didn't make it to the top of my to-read list until a few months ago.  When I read it, I was so glad I had.  Unlike some classics, this book truly deserves every award that it has gotten.  It's a perfect example of how a book can do things that a movie, even a good one, can't.  It uses beautiful writing and an interesting and heart-warming story to confront some very hard issues.  This book is definitely a must-read.
B000002HMH|5.0|I can understand why some would be turned off by the new direction that Metallica went. But, being open-minded, I listened to this album and still thoroughly enjoyed it. It doesn't thrash like the first five, but it has one thing that those albums do not have... humanity. Songs like \\"Hero of the Day,\\" \\"Until It Sleeps,\\" \\"Mama Said,\\" etc. actually mean something more deeper than getting into fights (i.e. \\"Kill 'Em All\\") or politics (i.e. \\"...And Justice For All\\"). The sound may be different, but the vocals, the drums, the strings are much more mature and human. I encourage those to listen to it again, REALLY listen to it.     Trust me, it's a pretty good album.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek IV plays as a fish-out-of-water story, with Kirk and his crew from the 23rd century going back to 1986 San Francisco. The visual effects are not too great, but the story does not need them. Giving this movie a more comedic value than the others was a risk, especially after the dramatic Star Trek II and the moody Star Trek III. Leonard Nimoy returns to direct after directing the previous movie, although this time, he is also acting as Spock. It is an understandably grueling task to alternate between acting and directing the movie, but Mr. Nimoy pulled it off, paving the way for future Star Trek actors to direct future installments on the television series and movies. <br />A lot of the movie involves Spock trying to rediscover what it means to be human, after his mind has been retrained as a Vulcan. This leads to some of the movie's comedy, such as the fact that he takes Kirk's advice that in the 20th century, you have to swear a lot to be taken seriously. <br />I have seen a non-Trekker watch this movie and enjoy it, so I can reccomend this movie freely.
0671027344|5.0|At the end of my freshman year last year, a friend suggested I read a book about a boy in high school since I like the Rocky Horror Picture Show and old alternative. So, I picked up \\"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower\\" and started to read it. <br /> <br />Oh.My.Gosh. I was amazed. The book follows a Freshman boy and shows the struggles we all go through in life. It's captivating, really. After reading this book, I proceeded to re-read it two more times and get really into it. It makes you think about your life, relationships, and friends. It makes you want to feel infinate, 24/7.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|After the dark and violent First Contact, Insurrection seems much brighter and more optomistic. The story also is centered around one main moral, which brings it back to what Star Trek really is (although there is still some action in it). <br />The movie brings in a Picard romance for the first time since TNG, and each of the characters has their own moments as well. Of course, no TNG film would be complete without Mr. Worf, so he comes to visit from Deep Space Nine. <br />I would say this film is good for Star Trek fans, as the air of the original series hangs around it.
B00005JOGU|3.0|Have you ever read or heard of an instance of a woman falling in love with a jailed murderer and thought, \\"How pathetic is that!\\"?<br /><br />On November 14, 1959 in Kansas, four members of the Clutter family were brutally murdered by Perry Smith and Richard Hickock. After years on Death Row and multiple appeals, they were hung by the neck until dead on April 14, 1965. Truman Capote's book based on the crime, IN COLD BLOOD, was published in 1966.<br /><br />CAPOTE is the cinematic depiction of Truman's 4-year obsession with the case, and his growing emotional attachment to Smith, as he researched material for IN COLD BLOOD. The author is played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Smith by Clifton Collins, and Hickock by Mark Pellegrino.<br /><br />Hoffman's Capote is 5 stars and worthy of an Oscar nomination. I would be satisfied if he wins, regardless of the others nominated for Best Actor in pictures that may not even have been released yet, because his performance as the brilliant, tormented, self-affected, and pathetic writer is that excellent. That being said, however, the film is a joyless and tedious character study that is one of the most boring films I've seen recently; my wife had to jab my side to keep me eyelids-up. The only highpoints for me were the achingly beautiful, but all too infrequent, wide-angle shots of the \\"Kansas\\" landscape (actually filmed in Manitoba), and the visual jolt when, towards the film's end, Smith reveals to Capote what actually happened in the Clutter farmhouse.<br /><br />CAPOTE is a must-see movie for any admirer of Truman and his writings, but it just wasn't for me.
B0009UC7H0|1.0|What an appaling waste of time this little number is.  We all love the mindless excitement of films such as Armageddon, Top Gun, Gone in 60 Seconds and other high concept, high camp action adventures.  Films that give us nothing but explosions, tension, the occasional laugh, all wrapped up in a neat package after 100 minutes.<br /><br />This film does not achieve any of that.<br /><br />If people think that this film (set a good couple of hundred kilometres away from the Sahara?) is the dawning of a new Indiana Jones then they are sorely mistaken.  It's not escapism, it's not fun, it's just dull, totally far fetched and unfortunately, not funny or witty in any way.<br /><br />I'd have to classify this film by saying it's two hours of my life that I'll never get back, and for that I am truly regretful.
B000002GQH|5.0|The Moody Blues third concept album \\"On the Threshold of a Dream\\" mesmerises the heart, mind and soul with musical themes on romantic and universal love. \\"Are you sitting comfortably?\\" Give this 13-song album a spin, and let the Moodies cast their spell.<br /><br />\\"In The Beginning\\" (by Graeme Edge) starts off with Pinder's mellotron droning, melding in harmony with an organ , then acting as ambient filler in a dialogue between the Individual Everyman and The Establishment.<br /><br />\\"Lovely To See You\\" (by Justin Hayward) is a electric guitar driven song juxtaposed with an peppy bass line about meeting up with and inviting a friend to \\"walk along to the next bend\\".<br /><br />\\"Dear Diary\\" (by Ray Thomas) is a jazzy bass and flute inspired song about a person noting a few events in his day.<br /><br />\\"Send Me No Wine\\" (by John Lodge) has Lodge and Hayward harmonising to a robust country and western type tune, accompanied by Pinder's mellotron.<br /><br />\\"To Share Our Love\\" (by John Lodge) is a throbbing bass, electric guitar and percussion song with superb vocal counterpoint built around the lyrics. Surprisingly, Pinder is the lead singer.<br /><br />\\"So Deep Within You\\" (by Mike Pinder) is a jazzy upbeat song, reminiscent of the original Moodies' line-up, using timpani, guitar and flute to excellent effect. Pinder sings it with passion and conviction, \\"Your love is like a forest fire. I want to touch the fire, so deep within you\\"<br /><br />\\"Never Comes The Day\\" (by Justin Hayward) opens with a softly strumming guitar and Hayward pensively singing \\"Never comes the day for my love and me,\\" then building to a crescendo with mellotron, harmonica and the Moodies in harmony.

B000026OHN|5.0|A very generous friend gave me this set several years ago and I will be forever in her debt. I had never considered buying Sviatoslav Richter playing Bach. For me he simply didn't seem to come out of the right tradition to play the Master of Leipzig. But I was mistaken, completely mistaken. This set of the WTC has become one of my most treasured possessions. For months it was in my car - a perfect way to listen to the Preludes and Fugues, a few at a time while driving short distances around town - and by now these performances are burned into my aural memory, as if they had always been there. There is such a feeling of inevitability about Richter's playing that I now cannot imagine them played any other way. Well, that's not entirely true, but close. Unlike Huibert Jonkers, whose review was posted here some months ago, I was a Glenn Gould groupie who thought his way with Bach was the best way. And though I still admire Gould, I must say that Richter has converted me. It's hard to put one's finger on what it is about Richter's playing except that it is so straightforward and full of good ol' artery-clogging cholesterol and yet so nuanced and highlighted, that it is impossible to resist. It's Romantic, I guess, and that's totally out of fashion these days. But I don't care about that. In fact, as an old pianist who has played the WTC at the keyboard for nigh on sixty years,  I continue to have a hard time listening to WTC on the harpsichord. I suspect I'm not alone in that. We've been swept along in recent years by the 'historically-informed performance' folks and yet there are some of us who are not entirely convinced that the old-fashioned way with Bach isn't the best. Richter certainly fits in the 'old-fashioned' camp and that's fine with me.<br /><br />Others have written here about individual details of these performances and I have little to add there. I am, like others, struck by Richter's wide dynamics and sometimes extreme tempi. For instance, the second prelude in WTC I goes faster than I've ever heard it and it is all the more exciting as a result. The overall shape of the performances, though, reveal a penetrating intellect and flawless technique put at the service of the music, granted Richter's own conception of the music, but who's to say that's not what Bach would have wanted?<br /><br />I urgently recommend this box, especially since it is so attractively priced.<br /><br />Scott Morrisonude in WTC I goes faster than I've ever heard it and it is all the more exciting as a result.

0895260131|4.0|I found the book to be very entertaining and informative. I particularly       enjoyed the insights of such intellects such as Churchill and de Tocqueville.
B000002H33|5.0|I didn't say it wasn't good to like Slayer, Dark Angel, etc. since they are good bands. But it's just when an elitest s**thead has to bash the music we all enjoy, it pisses me off! I don't always bash people, it's just d**kheads you like you and Anti-Pantera Fag that piss me off. Just mind your own business and suck each other off like you normally do!<br /><br />Metallica's best album is by far MOP, best song is Disposable Heores.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|Alicia Keys has revived the MTV Unplugged franchise with her show and this album.  Ms. Keys doesn't go the traditional unplugged route of stripping the songs down to their acoustic base, but she gives a stellar performance.  She doesn't alter the grooves from the studio versions, but she lets the songs breath and flexes her voice muscles without going over the top.  \\"Karma\\" and \\"Heartburn\\" perfectly segue together in a funky mix.  \\"Fallin'\\" has a haunting violin and the combination of Gladys Knight & The Pips' \\"If I Were Your Woman\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is the best moment on the album.  There are several other covers on the album and they are hit and miss.  The Rolling Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" is a duet with Maroon 5's Adam Levine that never gels while her take on Brenda Holloway's \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" is a high note.  Ms. Keys burst on the scene in 2001 with much fanfare and she has more than lived up to the hype.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Originally, I didn't want to see this movie.  I thought it would be another silly hollywood romance with the added burden of too much comedy (Carrey).  But when I actually saw it, I was just blown away by the understated acting talent evident in every single member of the cast.  I thought Carrey should have gotten an academy award.  The basic story has been described indepth by others -- but the important thing to get from this film is that nothing that ever happens to us is wasted or really to be regretted.  Even the worst relationships teach us something, and have some good, good memories.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Great movie, just a pity that it is so lightweight in terms of extra material. Fingers cross we'll be satisfied come the Special Edition in December
0307276902|4.0|I read this book because Oprah recommended it and she usually has Sixth Sense when it comes to good books!  <br /> <br />I wish I had ordered Martha Stewart's new book instead. <br /> <br />Although Frey is a good writer--even masterful in places--too much of the book was repetitious.  <br /> <br />One thing he does well is flesh out his characters so they become real, enabling his readers to sympathize with them. I felt the pain of his characters, but the joy of reading about the \\"overcomers\\" was the highlight of the book. And his dialogue seems realistic. <br /> <br />While I think this book might benefit some people with addictive personalities--in danger of becoming addicted to alcohol and/or drugs--I could only give it a 4-star. It's not for everyone. <br />
B00005JOHO|4.0|This true story follows a poor young caddy, Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) as he breaks golf's class barrier in 1913.  Francis is an immigrant's son in Boston, and knows only gentlemen are allowed to play golf.  But his idol, Harry Varden, was also a poor boy and he rose to become England's top professional golfer; Francis wants to do the same in America.  He manages to qualify for the U.S. Open and ends up playing head to head against Varden (Stephen Dillane) for the championship.<br /><br />This story has two protagonists, Ouimet and Varden; both are sympathetic and likeable characters, so it was hard to know who to root for (although the outcome is never in doubt).  Shia LaBeouf is very good as 20-year old Ouimet, and has a convincing golf swing.  Dillane is also quite watchable as the champ who is haunted by his past.  Peyton List plays Ouimet's high society love interest; it's a small part, but she is so sweetly beautiful that she steals all of her scenes.  Golfers are sure to like this movie, which takes place mostly on the course.  Non-golfers can enjoy it as well.<br /><br />Kona
B000002S4R|4.0|I can't help myself... Karajan just does it for me.  He's not for everyone, but I've heard too many wonderful works of his to every doubt he's a conducting genious.  This \\"Hollander\\" is no exception.  An underrated work, to be sure.  Karajan outdoes himself with a lavish performance and the Berliner Philharmonic was never better.  The only reason I didn't give this recording a '5' is that the voices are far subdued in some passages, almost to the point of being inaudible.  The voices are quite satisfactory, though probably not a 'premier' cast.  I'm quite pleased with this edition and I highly recommend it for any Karajan fan.
B000002GBD|5.0|Great album! Nazareth Rocks! Brings back lots of memories! A true blast from the past!!
B000AARKOO|4.0|Ridley Scott has done a good job in presenting this story.  Howevery, like most Hollywood productions in the last 20 years, there is a sentiment of bias against people of faith.  Christianity has been the favorite whipping post of Hollywood for some time now.  In this venture, both Christianity and Islam are shown for their better and lesser sides.  We see that both religions had their fair share of true heroes and true villians at a time when the world was in religious chaos. Religion is at the very core of human nature, and yet, Hollywood seems to hate this aspect of human life.  Christianity and Islam are the two most prevalent religions on Earth today and the Hollywood machine seems to hate them both with quasi religious fervor.  Maybe Hollywood has become totally Atheist and they resent the fact that the vast majority of people do believe in a God and in the supernatural.  The Hollywood moguls need to get back in contact with their audiences and stop alienating people of faith.  Religion and religious conviction are the overwhelming reality for most people on this planet.  Hollywood needs to stop making all religious people to seem like over zealous radicals, and rather as the day to day people that we are.  Monotheistic religions (particularly Christianity) have been spurned as psychotic for far too long.  GET A GRIP!  Most people are religious, and it is about time that Hollywood assented to this fact!
B000002B2T|5.0|Mad Season's Above was released early 1995 when Seattle rock was on the decline.  Temple of the Dog was done back in 91 and in 1995 Layne, Mike, Barrett, and Baker made theirs.  The album ventures with introspective ballads and classic metal.  Also there's a bluesy number Artifical Red, and nice saxaphones in Long Gone Day.  Long Gone Day and I'm Above were two of the best songs here, except River of Deceit.  Mark Lanegan's voice is always flawless and it shows on these two songs.  The heavier songs are great too.  The chemistry is amazing considering they all met up in drug rehab.  If you put Mark and Layne's voices together like I'm above.  The result is just perfect.  This was when music was honest and passionate.  Too bad Layne is no longer around to make another album like this.  In the meantime, everyone should go check out Bubblegum by Mark Lanegan.  He is one of the few artists from that era who's music is as fresh today as it was then.  Above is a great album and one of the best of 1995.
B00005JL78|5.0|The \\"pre-cog\\" crime thing was popular in '60s and '70s sci-fi. It's good to see it modernized in film. The plot strays far from the short story's. Yet it does, somehow, stay true to the author's typical formula and... weirdness. Great sets, acting, and special effects carry a gritty suspense story across the screen, darkly. Very enjoyable.
B0000035E7|4.0|This was the hardest CD of Nirvana's to adjust too. The last Nirvana studio CD i pruchased. I didn't like it the first several times I heard it, put it on my shelf and forgot about it. This is another CD (Insecticide being the other) which I didn't appreciate until after Foo Fighters and really started to accept the Metal sound as opposed to rock I'd always liked so much more. Admittedly not a big production recording it's based on only a couple of days of studio work. It's amazing to listen too in retrospect. Kurt's song writing, singing and guitar playing hadn't yet developed to full potential at this stage. Nirvana still lacked some confidence at this point (as well as Dave Grohl!!!). Given these draw backs the tracks reflect much of what's been written of Nirvana in these days. They were adolescents without any major money backing them. What they did have was a great deal of entusiasm, spirit and pure raw talent. Only there efforts in writing, performing and marketing themselves brought them to the attention of the bigger labels.<br />Mr. Moustache, Negative Creep, About a girl, School and Blew being particular highlights providing some indication of what was to come. At their very worst Nirvana still seem to come off better than most other bands in this \\"catagory\\". If you really like Nirvana this CD is another must have.
B000002J1U|5.0|Zeppelin lovers were disappointed when they got the third album. For them it is much less powerful, feel like where is THAT Zeppelin!! <br /> <br />However I like it. I even prefer it to the last two albums. Probably this third album attracts wide range music lovers like me, who listen from Classic, Jazz, Pops to Rock, rather than pure Rock `n' Roll fans. <br />This album is mentioned often about using acoustic guitar. But Page already used it at the first album and second too. I think he just loves playing guitars and want to try anything on it. And that makes them outstanding from other bands, doesn't it? <br />They already tried to combine folk song and heavy rock 'n' roll rhythm at the second album and at the third this approach got more sophisticated.  <br /> <br />I love ALL numbers in the album except Tangeline. I would like to comment some numbers which are not popular. <br />Frends: String section is amazing.  <br />Gallows Pole: I wonder how many times they play it in live, anyway I am glad Plant and Page revived this number in \\"No Quarter\\". That sounds combination of country music and contemporary music. <br />That's The Way: Simple and impressive number <br />BRON-Y-AUR STOMP: They often played this number, they must love it. You can't hear it without STOMP. <br />Hats Off to (ROY) Harpper: It obviously comes from south area in the US like old time New Orleans, Mississippi river. Page's guitar is just say \\"WOW\\". Unfortunately this number never performed in Live according to the \\"Zeppelin Completed Guide\\". <br /> <br />
B0002OOUP0|5.0|Raw Stones! The best music they've played in their own style  in years! Production is incredibly well done so the sound is sharp and clear. Crank it up and enjoy!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best Sci-Fi shows... EVER.  It is really too bad that Fox decided to cancel this series... it could have really gone places.  I highly recomend this to any Sci-Fi fan.  It has action, cool gadgets, great humor and excellent storylines. <br />A must see for all Sci-Fi fans!
B000002J1M|5.0|This is a timeless classic combining the best elements of 70's rock and 70's technology with mythology and classical music. Genesis is band that was continually experimenting, expanding and growing. Foxtrot is arguably their best work. The following albums Selling England by the Pound and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway are excellant albums as well however don't seem to hold the overwhelming strength of Foxtrot. Mostly due to the inclusion of the epic Supper's Ready. A fantasic pschydelic 20 minute vision of good verse evil with good being triumphant in the end! Horizon's a solo acoustic performance preceeds Supper's Ready so well it's always seemed more as the intro as opposed to separate song as it was treated by Genesis.<br />The disc starts out with Watchers of the Skies which was a concert opener for Genesis at the time. Gabrial appearing on stage with a reverse mowhawk haircut, bat wings cape and glowing eyes. Very powerful peice of music.<br />Get Em Out by Friday is a whimiscal comentary on social progress in the form of genetiaclly engineering human beings of smaller stature in order to conserve living space.<br />Time Table & Can Utility and the Coastliners reflect the type of materail Gabriel's Genesis is remembered for mixing mythology, classic music, rock with 70's technology.<br />This album is an excellant example of 4:20 in the aftetnoon escapism.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Eric Clapton on the guitar. <br />Jack Bruce on the bass. <br />Ginger Baker on the drums. <br /> <br />What more do you want?  A case can be made for all three being the best ever on their instrument of choice.  I loved these guys in 1968, when I discovered them.  They were truly \\"Cream\\".  Take a listen to any of their numerous bootleg concerts, or even the officially released live stuff.  They could play like no band before or since.  They could play fast.  They could play mid-tempo.  They could play slow.  They could play really, really slow.  And they did it better than anyone. <br /> <br />Finally, the reunion.  They can still play better than anyone.  My son listened to the DVD, and asked, can you imagine ANY of today's rock bands trying what they are doing?   <br /> <br />Eric Clapton may be better now than he was back then.  A couple of his soloes poured off the fretboard in a sizzling, dazzling display of speed and emotion that I don't remember him matching in his Cream days.  A couple of his soloes on \\"The Layla Sessions\\" outtakes maybe, but that's about it. <br /> <br />Jack Bruce plays with both power and finesse.  And, he makes it look so easy.  His voice doesn't have that elasticity it had when he was in his 20's, but the vocals were only startup and ending window dressing for the playing, anyway.  He is the only bass player I've ever heard that I listen to instead of the guitar.  The guy is a monster. <br /> <br />Ginger Baker makes it look easier than Jack Bruce does.  All that rhythm, all that power.  He never even breaks a sweat.  All four limbs doing something different, flailing about....amazing. <br /> <br />Put the three of them together, and the sum does exceede the parts.  An amazing, satisfying concert set that doesn't make all the waiting worth it, but comes close.  <br /> <br />5 Stars.
0739313126|4.0|This is an excellent story to put out as an audio book. Early on the story jumps around a lot while the plot is being set, listening to the story rather than reading it helps to make the story flow better and increases plot retension.<br /><br />Paul Michael does a fine job of reading and keeps your interest with voice inflections in the reading and the use of different voices for the major characters.
B000002U8G|4.0|opens with Pink Floyd's, and the world's,  greatest heavy rock song - One of These Days - an outstanding rollicking, heavy rock instrumental. Also a great opener to PF's \\"Collection of Great Dance Songs\\" superb compilation album.  <br /> <br />great PF album, good variety. <br /> <br />Echoes is very good, in the early stages maybe the gensis of Dark Side of the Moon ? Later, the haunting strains of guitar and synthesisers. Enjoy this track, just lay back, close the eyes, and listen. <br /> <br />Just get it !! <br />
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|the oc second season was great. it was shipped on time and works just fine. im a huge fan of the oc so it all worked out great!
B000003TAB|4.0|Sometimes it takes awhile to \\"adjust\\" to new music. I bought this CD shortly after it came out. Gave it a quick listen, didn't much like it and forgot about it for a long time. Now I lose it and plat it more than their major releases Nevermind & In Utero.<br />Kurt hated having labels put on thier music (they're too confining in defination) and here I go labeling them!<br />I had to adjust to the Metal aspects of the Foo Fighters in order to really appreciate just how good this disc really is. I've never been a big fan of Metal unless if had a good mix with something else. I've always been more of a rocker. Nevermind and In Utero contained many aspects of metal but they were so well constructed it was not a hold back on these disc's. Incesticide being an earlier effort, contains a much stronger influence of the traditional metal and punk treatments and techniques. I'd always been intriqued by punk as it's closer in relation to rock than metal, but I didn't know anything about. None of my friends listend to punk they all liked metal!<br />Although not immediate, after a few times listening I've found this to be one of my favorites. Many of the tracks included (Dive, Stain, Been a Son, Son of a Gun, Aneurysm) are just as compelling and important to the Nirvana catalog as Comes as you are, Heart Shaped Box, etc. Molly's Lips, a Vaselines cover for Nirvana, includes the best use of only two (2) guitar chords I've ever heard before. An absolutely amazing song.<br />The disc is a mix of previously recorded material this disc was actually issued prior to In Utero, while the band was still together.<br />I miss Nirvana so much, what a tragic loss. It still hurts!!!!!!
B000127LW2|5.0|I really enjoyed watching Season 1.  I must admit, the crew seems awkward after watching the greatness of season 4, but the plots are still great and the character development is amazing.  Very enjoyable.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I watched the Special on MTV and she blew me away . I knew the album would be hot. I've been listening to the album ALL week on The Leak. I fell in love. The standout tracks/performances  were \\"Streets of New York\\", which was cut from the TV special. Alicia goes \\"Love Jones\\" on us. She delivers a terrific and mood drifting perfromace of her poem \\"The Constant State of Going Nowhere\\" at the begining of the performance. This poem is featured in Tears For Water as well. Her rendidtion of \\"Every Little Bit Hurts\\" is also a good showstopper. She does a good job, of this Brenda Hollaway remake/Teena Marie. it sounds like church a lil bit. lol. Alicia Switches up on us with \\"Wild Horses\\". This is one hell of a performace because it blends soul with country beautifully. THE BEST TRACK/PERFROMANCE which was cut from the special was the brand new \\"Stolen Moments\\". This is a slow, dark, and midnight type of song. Alicia pulls u into her world of blues and darkness and delivers a spectacular piano solo as well. This is a jazz song and stays on repeat at night. \\"We can take flight, like a thief in the night, Stolen moments with you\\". so poetic. The song was based off her poem \\"stolen Moments\\" in Tears for Water.  I also LOved her performance of \\"Fallin\\". Before u go, \\"thats so old\\", Alicia sings this song differently with the same lyrics and music, but a different style. Just Listen. And get pulled into an intimate night of PURE music. A+++
1591840562|2.0|I was disappointed - the sub-title is 'the time-tested, battle-hardened guide for anyone starting anything' - however this is not a true reflection of the contents.  The book is aimed at people starting a company or organisation.  I was hoping it would be more about motivational techniques for people trying to start other projects - the title suggested that to me.  There were some useful items in it nonetheless, and no doubt people starting a company would possibly find it a good resource, but if you want to start anything else, then read Jack Canfield's 'The Sucess Principles' which is a better all-round resource !
B00000K0T8|5.0|I love this CD.  Bought it new 3 times.  Buy this album, and listen to it on headphones.  It's the only way you will truely come to appreciate the perfect balance of beats, lyrics, emotion and tone.

B00005R5G9|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time, epecially the 10-minute 1980s-intro to the movie. Its two main characters are Andrew McCarthy (from Pretty in Pink) and Kim Cattrall (before SATC). Though it is a corny movie, it appeals to both girls AND guys. And, of course, it includes the typical fantastic music montage.
0060594888|4.0|This book is definitely worth reading.  I found it quite inspiring and have taken stock of my life since I read it, and have come up with some goals and direction for myself !  There are a few parts that are repetitive, however, all in all it is an easy and enjoyable read.  A lot of it is common sense of course, but the authors present it all in a positive and inspiring way.  It will definitely help people to look forward and think about what they want from life.  I am definitely glad I read it !! :)
B00005RDRO|5.0|I thought this was just ok the first time I viewed it and now realize that I have seen it many times since and finally bought my own DVD copy, it's great hammy fun!  <br />Just think Mr. Lionel Twain living at 22 Twain played by Truman Capote and go from there.
0525948023|3.0|I have read THE POWER OF NOW and enjoyed much of the points Tolle makes and this is a credible and sound follow up--as well done as the former. It is a further discussion on the first book, but not much more. I have read all of the reviews here--and I think it's very important  to observe the teacher. History knows the true value of this.  <br /> <br />One correction I want to make is to the gentleman who refers to what someone else pointed out in reference to Rudolph Steiner--what he called the ETHERIC body. That is an exclusive term that only Steiner used. \\"Ethereal\\" body sounds like a \\"new age\\" term--but essentially, I am not sure what this man is trying to say that it is \\"outmoded \\"--that's like saying spirituality is \\"old hat \\". You know? <br /> <br />Anthroposophy (Steiner's term) was started as a decided departure from Theosophy--mainly because Steiner was not interested in the \\"hero-worship\\" of the young J. Krishnamurti. (Krishnamurti later left Theosophy, too , and went on his own). Steiner is considered a luminary of the first order--there has been no one quite this man; this, I want to say, very modest and self-effacing man, whose works are in the hundreds. Thousands of his lectures have been turned into books. (see the Anthroposophic Press). He is \\"heady\\" stuff, and not easy to read (at least, for me). <br /> <br />With that said: I visited Tolle's website. Read his \\"interview\\" on his new book. He seems to be quite enamoured with himself. (You know, all this \\"change\\" he's responsible for.) This can become a bit dangerous. That's what  I see. Only an observation.Think of it as you wish. <br />
B0002OERI0|3.0|Pisser \\"The Misser\\"...Ever heard of a band called The Clash? How about Hsker D? Maybe X? Or how about The Pogues? Just for chance, The Slits? Hell, maybe even Crass? The point is: Although this record isn't the eight wonder of the world or the savior of \\"alternative land\\" as a lot of critics seem to think, the sole notion that punk rock WAS (Since punk rock cannot be undestood and doesn't make sense without the historical, social, political, cultural, blah, context where and when it happened.), ONLY (as in \\"a unique purpose\\"), about being able to pull out something from a guitar, a bass and a drum kit, dismissing every other instrument, is utterly anti-punk. At least from my point of view.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This movie is very good but very disgusting!! Jesus starts getting beat in the middle of the movie so you gotta wait for it. I cant believe what they did to Jesus. Well, there burning in hell right now. The part that was sick was when they were beating him with a chain whip covered in blades and it stuck in the side of his tomach and pull his flesh out the back. And it was sad when they beat him while they made him carry his cross. This movie is NOT for people who hate bloodshed. Mel Gibson did an excellant job at making this movie, and deserves to be recognized as a legend director.
0743455967|5.0|As a writer in the very early stages of my career, I found this book to be very inspirational and informative.  Mr. King tells you about his life before being published and his struggles with drugs and alcohol, and how he rose above them.  After an autobiographical section, he gets into the mechanics of writing fiction and all of the do's and don'ts he learned during his career.  If you're in college or just out, I highly recommend this book.
0671027344|5.0|I first read The Perks of Being a Wallflower my senior year of last year and believe me when I say you will absolutely fall in love with this book. To me I think of it as a work of art. Each page flows brilliantly into the next and by the first few pages you instantly become consumed into Charlie's world. I believe that everyone can relate to Charlie's story, especially teens. Read the story for yourself and you'll know what I mean when I say that this book is a book that everyone should read and will enjoy :-)
B000089CJI|5.0|This CD has taken hold in my music collection.  It has already become one of my favorites.  I tell all my friends about the almost techno sound/almost poetry lyrics or The Postal Service only to discover that most of them already love this band.  I recommend this CD to anyone.
B000AL730O|3.0|I have been a McCartney fan since I was 12 years old when the Beatles first hit these United States shores. I think that he is one of the most talented musician/singer/songwriters to come down the pike, however I can't agree with the critics that this is the \\"only thing that matters since the Beatles broke up.\\" <br />In my opinion \\"Flaming Pie\\" is a much superior album, and one of my all time favorites. I feel that Macca still has the greatest album of his career yet to release.
B000B0QOJA|5.0|It seems that quite a few historic unreleased recordings of John Coltrane have been making their way to the shelves as of late. Just weeks prior to the Impulse release of \\"One Down, One Up: Live at The Half Note\\", EMI unveiled an excellent top notch 1957 Carnegie Hall performance recorded during Coltrane's brief but legendary stint with Thelonious Monk's Quartet. With the release of this present 2-disc set of Coltrane's legendary 1965 performances at New York's Half Note club, another Holy Grail of jazz has finally seen the light of day.<br />Much has been written and discussed on these performances but until now, no official recordings had been available. Now with the release of this double CD, the world can finally hear what all the rage was truly about. The recordings were taken from late night radio broadcasts and apart from the final tracks on each disc being incomplete (due to time constraints on the original broadcast) and some minor dropouts on the performance of \\"One Down, One Up\\", the sound quality as well as the performances are outstanding.<br />The legendary half-hour performance of \\"One Down, One Up\\" is worth the price of admission alone. The piece is one continuous tenor sax improvisation with Coltrane spontaneously creating and recreating musical ideas that never let up. It's a performance that literally leaves one stuck to their chair. The piece becomes more intense as McCoy Tyner's piano drops out followed by Jimmy Garrison's bass leaving Coltrane going head-to-head with drummer Elvin Jones for over 10 minutes before everyone comes back in the bring this powerplay to an exciting finish.<br />Also included are a stellar but sadly abbreviated version of \\"Afro Blue\\" which ends just as Coltrane is letting rip on soprano sax following a solid McCoy Tyner piano solo, a nearly 20-minute take on the spiritual \\"Song Of Praise\\" which is arguably superior to the studio version included on the \\"Quartet Plays\\" album with its endless torrents of spontaneous invention and to close the set, an awesome but also unfortunately abbreviated version of \\"My Favorite Things\\" which displays just how far this piece had come from its original 1960 version. There is fortunately more to listen to with \\"My Favorite Things\\" as it fades out after 23 minutes whereas \\"Afro Blue\\" faded just short of 13.<br />What else can be said about Coltrane's performances at the Half Note except for the fact that this is truly some breathtaking music. Coltrane and his Quartet were in their prime during these performances and these recordings are proof that they definitely were giving it their all.<br />Besides the great music, this CD-set includes some well-written essays and sleevenotes from Ashley Kahn (the author of a book that gives detailed analysis on Coltrane's immortal masterwork \\"A Love Supreme\\") and Coltrane's son Ravi who also oversaw the production and release of this music.<br />If you're a die-hard Coltrane fan, this CD-set is definitely a must. If you're just starting out, this is definitely worth picking up later on down the line. Thus is positively a genuine piece of music history and is classic Coltrane at its very best.<br />Recommended!!!close the set, an awesome but also unfortunately abbreviated version of \\"My Favorite Things\\" which displays just how far this piece had come from its original 1960 version.

B000068OCS|1.0|\\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" is a pretentious \\"man vs. nature\\" film that is repetitive to the point of annoyance. It only presents the serenity of nature, and the worst of society, and evades the achievements of mankind, as well as the violence and shambles nature can create, without any human assistance.<br /><br />The beginning and end of this film is in normal or slowed time (with much use of time-lapse photography), but the bulk of the film is a hyper journey through highways and downtown rush hours, at a dizzying pace. The music by Philip Glass is particularly irritating in this section, and its effect is like having a frenetic ice cream truck parked in front of your house for nearly an hour. The music for the rest of the film is a Hopi chant, and would be nice if it was a little more varied.<br /><br />The scenes presented of human habitation are of dire slums, Las Vegas garishness, rusted machinery, etc. It is a never-ending parade of the most dreary and unattractive filmmaker Godfrey Reggio could find no doubt, in his search for images in which to despise his species, and particularly America. One has to ask, if technology and modern life are so evil, and we would be better off living in caves, how much fuel did Reggio waste making all that aerial photography? And what of the fancy cameras and color film? Total running time (better spent watching something else) is 90 minutes.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I have their self-titled debut, Sad Songs, and Alligator and, while they all are fantastic, what I notice most is a band that has really found itself and developed over time.  Alligator takes off where Sad Songs left off.  They are individually brilliant musicians that combine to form a awesome sound.  Bryan Devendorf's ability and syncopation on percussion is especially stirring. <br /> <br />Buy this album, these guys are gonna be big.

1559409010|5.0|I highly recommend this move. I don't think it is anti Christian. I believe that this is the Monty Python groups best work. They are so educated - in the best tradition of English universities, they know their classical history, Greek Roman to the transition to Judeo Christian.<br /><br />In the Python Movie, Jesus Christ has only a brief appearance and he is presented as a noble, great spiritual speaker of truth. But, he is trying to speak simple, spiritual truths to well, regular people who are mostly morons, idiots, people like the people we know in our age.<br /><br />I love the scene where Jesus is preaching his sermon on the mount and saying to the crowds:<br /><br />\\"blessed are the meek\\"<br /><br />Some regular idiots in the cheap seats at the back say:<br /><br />\\"Did he say blessed are the GREEKS? Why should the Greeks be blesses\\" and the arguing and bickering starts, Christ message is screwed up and politicized from the start.<br /><br />This movie also has a very, very interesting take on the conflict between Roman rule, the Pax Roman (Roman peace) and Jewish political ambitions with the Judeo Christian split happening.  Jews were upset that they were defeated and occupied by the Romans, non Jewish Gentiles who were arrogant in believing that the Roman way was better than other ways, including Jewish ways. The Jews were plotting secret terrorist rebellions against the Romans with the Jewish religious myth that a Jewish Messiah would appear to restore the glory of Jewish rule in Jerusalem. Christ comes as a prince of peace and this isn't the Messiah that many of the Jewish political leaders, high priests want.<br /><br />There is a great scene where John Cleese is shouting at his Jewish terrorists to incite them to fight the Romans.<br /><br />\\"What have the Romans ever done for us? Name one good thing Roman rule has brought us?\\"<br /><br />A small voice in the back says:<br /><br />\\"The aqueducts\\"<br /><br />Then other voices start adding<br /><br />\\"Roman roads, rule of law, modern medicine, schools etc\\".<br /><br />Cleese clearly frustrated says \\"Yeah, well outside the aqueducts, the roads, rule of law, schools, modern medicine, civilization, what have the Romans ever done for us\\"?<br /><br />The idea being that yeah, the Romans weren't the complete bad guys and terrorists and anti colonial rebellions aren't always noble etc.<br /><br />I really liked this movie. I enjoy movies about important parts of history, the Python Troop was the best. Maybe they will reunite to do a tongue and cheek movie about the prophet Mohammed and his followers who might not have gotten the message right..... don't think this type of humor goes over well with Muslims who are not known to have a good sense of humor.adding <br /> <br />\\"Roman roads, rule of law, modern medicine, schools etc\\". <br /> <br />Cleese clearly frustrated says \\"Yeah, well outside the aqueducts, the roads, rule of law, schools, modern medicine, civilization, what have the Romans ever done for us\\"? <br /> <br />The idea being that yeah, the Romans weren't the complete bad guys and terrorists and anti colonial rebellions aren't always noble etc. <br /> <br />I really liked this movie.

B000AL730Y|5.0|I always approach a new McCartney release with cautious optimism.  Let's face it, it's late in the game, not only for all those 60s demigods ( who are still kicking), but also for us so-called fans.  I'm not the same person that got goosebumps in wild anticipation of a new Beatles LP, and for sure Sir Paul isn't either.  When I survey his entire solo output, I still have a soft spot for his early stuff, McCartney and Ram in particular, and for Tug Of War.  I also really like the She's My Baby/Beware My Love sequence on At The Speed Of Sound, but two songs do not an album make.  All of his LPs have their moments, but none of his subsequent work, not even Flaming Pie, approaches the level of brilliance of his work with the Beatles or the aforementioned LPs.  Frankly, I'd given up even dreaming he'd ever approach that level of brilliance again.  Really.  But, unbelievably, he has. <br /> <br />It's interesting to ponder what makes this album work so much better, at least for me, than Driving Rain or Flaming Pie.  Certainly, Nigel Godrich was an inspired choice for a producer.  His production absolutely brings out the best in each and every song.  I know that Driving Rain received much accolade, but remained a fairly empty listening experience for me.  Song for song, this LP has it all over Driving Rain.  The hooks might not be as sharp as they were in his heyday, but they are there.  There is richness to this LP, particularly with repeated listenings, that just hasn't been there for me with his previous LPs.   <br /> <br />Also, and I may be dead wrong about this, but there seems to be some torment and unhappiness in Paul's soul, and artists in torment always do their best work.  I know that not all lyrics a songwriter writes can be taken as a personal statement but, as Paul himself says, \\"I'm sure the analysts could have a heyday.\\" <br /> <br />Paul can be very proud of this piece of work, and it is a wonderful addition to his cannon.  For me, it's a wonderful surprise and a wonderful gift.  For the first time in ages, I'm enjoying repeated listenings of a new work by my favorite musician.  It feels really, really good.

0375758992|4.0|In her blunt and honest memoir of her childhood in Rhodesia, Zambia, and Malawi in the 1970s and 1980s, Alexandra Fuller does not offer retrospective apologies or justifications for her family's intransigent defense of white rule. And her parents are far from contrite: \\"If we could have kept one country white-ruled, it would be an oasis,\\" her inebriated mother told a visiting stranger a few years ago. Instead, Fuller's story simply presents what it was like to live and think as a white African, in whites-only communities; she does not attempt to convey the Africa beyond her immediate experience. In other words, this isn't a book about living in Africa, per se; more specifically, it is a book about being a white African.<br /><br />I imagine that the reason the racial component of her account has received the most attention--and the most resistance--from readers and critics is largely because we have grown accustomed to confessional memoirs and reflective chronicles that depict such upbringings repentantly, regretfully, or harshly. Fuller's goal is to present her youth as it seemed to her then, not as it seems to her (and us) now. In fact, appended to the end of the paperback edition is a reader's guide in which Fuller acknowledges and explains (perhaps belatedly, for some readers) that \\"almost half my life was realized in a bubble of Anglocentricity, as if black Africans had no culture worth living and as if they did not exist except as servants and (more dangerously) as terrorists.\\"<br /><br />The cultural \\"bubble\\" aspect aside, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is, I think, even more successful in presenting the comedy and tragedy of living in a uniquely dysfunctional family, which had more than its share of personal tragedies--including the death of three siblings. While Fuller's father was participating in combat operations on behalf of white rule against black insurgents, her mother was slowly losing her mind--descending into a maelstrom of alcoholism and madness. Some of her family's exploits have to be read to be believed. (I can't imagine what her parents, both of whom still appear to have been alive when the book was published, thought of their portrayals.)<br /><br />It's quite remarkable how the author manages to retain her sense of perspective, her dignity, and her humor (and she is quite funny, if dryly so). The other surviving aspect of her childhood is Fuller's love of her homeland--perhaps not the people, who (outside her family) are always viewed peripherally, but its \\"hot embrace\\": the sights, sounds, smells, and \\"the incongruous, lawless, joyful, violent, upside-down, illogical certainty of Africa.\\"d madness.

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Since the release of her first CD, I have been enamored with Alicia Keys. Her piano chops, her songwriting skills, her singing talent, everything is just simply amazing. And that's just on the CD. Bring it to the stage, and Alicia is the epitome of the words \\"performer\\" or \\"entertainer\\". She completely draws you in, and the setting is so intimate with all live instrumentation, enhanced by the 9 foot grand piano used during the concert. My favorite tracks are the 3 new ones (I count \\"Streets of New York\\" as one), and the remakes of \\"Fallin\\", \\"How Come You Don't Call Me\\", \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" and \\"Diary\\" (haunting, to say the least). I was not particularly fond of the Mos Def/Common/Damien Marley collab, merely because it seemed so out of context with the rest of the unplugged atmosphere. Also, Adam Levine tries hard, but unfortunately brings the Stones' \\"Wild Horses\\" down to a \\"filler\\" status. But the other highlights are ubiquitous, causing the listener to forget about the lowlights. <br /> <br />About the \\"Content-Protected\\" feature, these are almost always posted on Amazon.com. So when I see that a CD is content protected, and I have the knowledge that it will NOT be playable on my iPod, I simply purchase the album on the iTunes store. That way, you never have to worry about compatibility. And it all goes towards the final count for the RIAA. <br /> <br />That being said, I encourage you to purchase this CD - from whatever venue - because it is simply no short of breathtaking. I also recommend purchasing the accompanying DVD of the Unplugged concert, just because watching the show, feeling the energy and the vibe is so real when it's on video. The energy is almost tangible.

B000AQBA1W|4.0|The Corrs have been my favorite band ever since I first heard \\"Breathless\\" on country (yes, that's right) radio. <br />Ever since then, i have bought every Corrs album. When i bought this one, however, I knew i wasnt going to be treated to the same pop that defines all their previous work.  <br /> <br />This album is very good, though. I listened to it for the first time when i was getting ready for bed, and i fell asleep right after the cd ended, it was that relaxing. <br /> <br />All of the tracks are very light traditional Irish songs with somewhat silly lyrics. Nothing like I've ever heard before. The instrumentals, in all their albums, have been some of my favorite songs of all time! The two included on this album, Haste to the Wedding and Old Hag, are more traditional sounding, and truly better for it.  <br /> <br />Top tracks on this album:  <br />1. Old Town <br />2. Buachaill On Eirne <br />3. Haste to the Wedding <br />4. Old Hag <br /> <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|At the beginning of the 2005 I would have told you that 'Firefly' was one of Batman's enemies in the cartoons.I never knew who Joss Whedon was. Never saw Angel or Buffy. I heard about this show on a Star Trek forum talking about the upcoming movie. So I decided to rent the series and check it out.  <br /> <br />I wasn't sure if I liked it at the beginning but as the episodes went on I started to care about the characters and enjoy their freshness. Something I can't say anymore about predictable Star Trek.  <br /> <br />What ranks it for me as wonderful is the sense of humour. It's so difficult for scifi to get humour right. It's so geeky at times(Worf saying, \\"Assimilate this\\").  <br /> <br />Also, THE WOMEN!!! Beautiful, charming, smart, sexy, and strong.  <br /> <br />If you want something different and well done in the scifi genre then check out Firefly. It's a pity this got cancelled. It could have been the next big thing.
B0002S947K|5.0|When buying a pair of jeans I found myself hoping the queue would move slower becuase I was really enjoying the song on the instore speakers.  I found myself asking the guy at the counter, who bounced me to the office, who bounced me to one of the staff who was off.  I ended up ringing them later to find out who it was.  <br />30 seconds of 'Shelter' a bitter lovesong with a dusty country feel, sold me on the album.  'How Come' provides a funky upbeat take on the state of the free world, which I recommend you blare on your car stereo and sing at the top of your lungs when you're stuck in traffic.  'Narrow Escape' has a very Damien Rice feel - especially with the sweet mournful female backing, not unlike Lisa Hannigan. The fiddle and piano playing on 'Hannah' is a little country, a little bluesy, and resulting combination pulls on the heartstrings.  The album could be called a little slow overall - but if it's what you love, you'd hate anything else.  Mostly it's an album for sitting in windowsills, dancing slowly to with someone when the party's over, and in your ears on train journeys.
B00012FXAE|5.0|In many ways this is my favorite Aliens film.  It takes a couple of watchings to realize that this isn't just a clone of Alien, even if the monsters are pretty much the same.  Sigourney Weaver plays Ripley again, awakening after some fifty years of suspended animation to discover a world with which she has little connection.  Her daughter dead of old age, and the company intent on punishing her for destroying one of their ships, the embittered Ripley is left no choice but to become a dock worker in a world that has no use for pilots who have lost their licenses.<br /><br />The world of the alien has been terraformed and colonized.  The company's chilling decision on learning that there might be a death ship on the planet is to send in some investigators without any preparation.  The inevitable happens, and contact with the colony ceases and the worst is suspected.  Ripley is drafted by Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a sleazy executive with few moral and a lot of greed, to act as consultant to a team of space marines that should be able to handle almost anything an alien life form can try.  Emphasis on 'should' of course.<br /><br />The marines find that the colonists are dead, except for one young girl - Newt Jordan (Carrie Henn), who has stayed alive by hiding from the host of aliens that now have full run of the colony.  The marines can kill the aliens, but the aliens can kill them.  And there are a lot of the slimy things.  Even worse, the creatures seem to have developed into something more than an animal and pretty soon, the humans are trapped on the planet and caught in a protracted last stand.<br /><br />The story itself is excellent.  The film is full of a lot of action, considerably more human interest than Alien did, and an excellent level of acting for an action film.<br /><br />Overwhelming special effects are avoided, but there's no lack of detailed scenes and spooky alien photos.  Even where the action is predictable it's still great fun to watch.  I found the special edition of the film is even better than the theatrical release -- good to the last bite.ound the special edition of the film is even better than the theatrical release -- good to the last bite.

0743454537|5.0|I really loved this book and the topic it was about. In the book Anna is a 13 year old girl who wants to be normal but can't because her older sister Kate has acute lukemia and Anna is gentically designed to be a donor to Kate. Feeling like she's had enough Anna decideds to file a lawsuit for emancipation and it causes ripples through the family.<br /><br />The characters were all very well written and developed over the length of the book. Anna who is trying to find herself and yet already has. Sara who as a mother thinks she is doing the best for her children. Brian who doesn't really take sides until the end. Jesse the boy who is a juvenile deliquent just wanting attention. Campbell the hotshot attorney who finds that not all things are about work and sometimes you have to be honest with others. Julia who is still trying to find love after being hurt by Campbell in the past. And Kate rounds them all off as the sick daughter who everyone wants to live but she in fact hates living the way she is.<br /><br />I really found the book as an eye opener to what if I was in their shoes. Would I make the same decisions they did or would I make different dicesions. The ending really made me cry because it was so tragic but yet it had to happen as a resolution. This is one book that will always remain one of my top favorites.

0312954468|5.0|It's a guilty pleasure of sorts, and although it is well written, it really is (on the most basic level) an epic action/adventure novel. I'm generally not into books like this, but I've read this one 3 times, and it still never gets old. It's a book you read purely for entertainment, and it's got a captivating story.<br /><br />The characters are incredibly well developed throughout the book, as it traces an entire generation, and manages to carry the humanity of the characters through the epic reach of the story.<br /><br />Since so many others have already delineated the story, I guess I'll just give it my stamp of approval. It's one of the few books I have really had a hard time putting down, as (appropriately) simple as its narrative is. There's convincing emotion, and complex human interractions. The narrator Taita is an unexpectedly charismatic lead; a narscisistic but brilliant eunuch defined by his dedication and compassion. His characters are at times architypal, but Smith is a true master at manipulating your emotions. His villains are completely (if not transparently) depraved, and his heroes pure and chivalrous. The clash between them is pure hollywood style extravaganza, and it's entertaining as all hell.<br /><br />The book might be too much for people offended by gratuitous violence or graphic sex, because the book is loaded with both. It's actually somewhat indulgent in those respects, but what good adventure fiction isn't?<br /><br />People here have complained that it is historically innacurate, but what epic fiction isn't? And really, who's pretending that this is a tome to cull some kind of real understanding of ancient Egypt. Nobody's trying to claim that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a misrepresentation of history, and this novel should be comparably exempt from such criticisms. It's meant to be fun, so be warned by the overly cynical critics of the book; you're not going to learn anything. It's a book meant to entertain, so enjoy it and don't over analyze it.<br /><br />And, at all costs, avoid the terrible sequel \\"Warlock.\\"l costs, avoid the terrible sequel \\"Warlock.\\"
B000A0GP4K|3.0|I wholly understand some reviewers' frustration with director Scorsese's \\"artistic pretension\\" in the construction of \\"No Direction Home\\" - the use of Dylan getting booed during his \\"electric\\" set on a British Tour in 1966 as a link to various aspects of his life and career. <br /> <br />Personally, I found the device both fascinating and helpful. I walked away with the feeling that I finally understood what Dylan was about: all he ever wanted from the get-go was to be a rock 'n' roll star.  His immediate goal, as shown in his high school yearbook, was to \\"join Little Richard.\\" That's about as far removed from emulating Woody Guthrie as you can get without dyeing your hair fluorescent pink.  <br /> <br />By the time Bob Zimmerman graduated, there wasn't much of Little Richard left in \\"rock\\" music; top 40 radio had been overtaken by the Fabians, the Ankas, and those three other Bobbys: Darin, Vee and Vinton. So Dylan discovers folk music, and is captivated by its raw honesty - something the young man from Hibbing has a problem with, given the tall tales about his upbringing.  Still, he pursues the genre, eventually discovering his prowess as a writer.  On his way to becoming the poet laureate of the coffee house, his songs grow more and more abstract, which eventually earns him the blind adoration of the great unwashed and the scorn of genuine poets like Ewan MacColl. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, there's no denying he became a driving force.  And yet... every time somebody makes a statement about Dylan's contribution to the music, or his impact on audiences, or his effect on other folk musicians, the man himself responds with comments like: \\"That wasn't my thing.\\" \\"I didn't mean for that to happen.\\" \\"I couldn't understand where they were coming from.\\" \\"That wasn't what I was trying to do.\\" <br /> <br />Well, what WAS he trying to do when he was knocking every folk artist, from Baez to Seeger, for a loop?  Dylan won't tell us, but according to Scorsese, he was just making his way back to rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />Thus, at strategic moments throughout, we pop back to 1966 and watch electric Dylan on stage getting harrassed.  Of course, he's thoroughly stoned - presumably to anesthetize himself from the rejection.  You're a rock musician, Bobby... happy now?  Hmmmm, apparently not. <br /> <br />Ultimately \\"No Direction Home\\" is as transparent as its subject tries so very hard not to be.  It does, however, strive for an enigmatic ending.  When all is said and done, you're left to ponder: did Dylan realize at the time that the rock 'n' roll dream for which he'd bolted Hibbing wasn't all it was cracked up to be, or did his post-tour motorcycle accident simply knock some sense into him?  Surely it had to have been one or the other. <br /> <br />Just don't expect the Bard of Vague to tell you.
B0000019PA|4.0|When I first heard In The Aeroplane Over the Sea, I never could have imagined that it would be as influencial as it obviously is. I've talked to a number of people who are quick to name it in their top five albums of all time, but I can't quite understand the fanatacism that endorses the album.<br /><br />It starts off amazingly, and continues to be incredible up to \\"Two Headed Boy.\\" From that point on the album significantly (and incrementally) goes downhill, but it reaches quite a height before it does.<br /><br />The vocals that front the music are some of the most unique and expressive found in this kind of music... which comes across as something like a cross between acoustic-singer-songwriter and flamboyant orchestration. The songs soar in a stripped down way, and are propelled by (mostly) poignant lyrics. The songs can be inspirational and uplifting while being simultaneously heart-wrenching when it wants to be, and it all works...<br /><br />It just loses steam. The vocals, as expressive and unique as they are, started to grate on me after a while. I can take the album in segments, but listening to it all the way through gets tiresome for me. The second half of the album is primarily dominated by comparatively minimal acoustic songs, and it feels a little detatched from the mystery and grandiosity of the first half.<br /><br />All that aside, it's still a great album, and it deserves a great deal of the praise that's been heaped upon it. It has influenced countless musicians since the album dropped, while the band dissapeared without a trace off the face of the planet.<br /><br />There's something intriguing about that enigmatic drive behind the music. It is intensely emotional and yet guarded in a variety of ways. If you want to hear something different and authentic, pick up the album. There's something great going on in this music, and it refuses comparisons to other bands, as much as countless other musicians have bitten off its style.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Much has been made of this CD, in both positive and negative aspects.  Many have claimed that this is not Green Day's best CD.  That would be, in my opinion, entirely correct.  Green Day's best was, without question, \\"Dookie\\". <br />That said, this is an entirely different Green Day than that of ten plus years ago.  This is a matured, aging (yes, that's right) punk rock band that has decided to take a new track, a more political one.  They're not the only ones like this, either.  Consider bands such as Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, The Ataris - none of which sounds remotely like they did when they put out their first demo albums in the mid 1990s.  Green Day has been around considerably longer than any of those bands - they certainly have the right to change! <br />And change they do.  From the first note of \\"American Idiot\\" to the last note of \\"Whatsername\\", they relentlessly hammer a message into the head of the listener - don't be an American Idiot.  But, more than just repetitively hammer a message, they make a story out of it - similar to what you might find on Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" or The Who's \\"Tommy\\" (don't get me wrong; Green Day is not in a league with either of those bands; it's just a point of comparison). <br />Green Day has changed drastically in the last sixteen years.  Some might say that it's for the better; some for the worse.  I personally say that \\"American Idiot\\" is destined to be a rock classic, a CD that dared to speak out against the Bush administration in a cohesive, intelligent way.  Whether or not you agree with Green Day's politics, if you are a true American, then you must admit that they are one of very few to make use of their First Amendment rights in a way that will actually make people listen and think.
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|This movie is generally fine for the whole family.  It's really funny,has a good plot and is hard to stop watching...even the second or third time through.  There are several 'comical' scenes where gender confusion is introduced.  For families who care about religious values, some of those scenes may bother them.  Also, it may be offensive actually to people who are in favor of alternative lifestyles, because in this movie those traits are laughed at.<br /><br />The plot of greed being a force to destroy people is a healthy and instructive plot for young people to learn.  The idea that one must go for the big dream in their heart or they will live to ever regret it is emotionally palpable and very effective.<br /><br />This movie should be seen by everyone!
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|Ian Anderson has finally graced us with a Christmas CD.  It was just a matter of time. Ian Anderson plays the Christmas classics as only he can. He uses a celtic style flute on several of the songs. Ian Anderson as you would expect comes up with exquisite arrangements, that only he would be able to do  The music is the type of music you would expect from Ian Anderson, acoustic music with alot of flute.  Many of the songs are recycled songs from Tull's calalog, but there are some new songs that are truely Gems.  God rest ye merry Gentlemen is very good. Pavane is also worth the listen.  This CD will satisfy your sweet tooth for Jethro Tull and surprisingly will get you into the Christmas mood as well.  Enjoy........................
0394806220|5.0|Mr. Brown was a gift to my son.  I have been reading it to him since he was a few months old.  He is now 9 months old, and still no other book keeps his attention quite like Mr. Brown.  The sounds are fun and interesting to him.  I now give the same gift to my friends who are pregnant or have infants.
B000008H1U|5.0|Crest of a Knave is a CD that put Jethro Tull back on the map after several substandard albums. <br />This CD is second only to Aqualung and could be considered a \\"Career album\\" <br />Martin Barre is back to playing the best lead guitar of his career and Anderson is playing his flute and acoustic guitar as well as he ever has also. <br />Steel Monkey is a heavy metal rocker with a very hard driving sound, all about Iron workers. <br />Farm on the Freeway is another solid song with a very lively flute. <br />She said she was a dancer is a nice acoustic piece and has a very lively guitar. <br />Budapest is another song on the album that is as good as any song Ian Anderson has ever done, either with Tull or solo. <br />No Jethro Tull collection is complete without this CD. <br />After all it was voted Heavy Metal CD of the year, a Prize Ian Anderson would probably like to forget............Enjoy
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I was expecting more celtic music, but they do sound great anyway. A pleasure to listen to.
B00005ASIL|3.0|What you have here is technically Jethro Tulls most commercial songs. Yes Aqualung is on it and so is Locomotive Breath and many other of their best known songs. <br />The problem is that you get an edited version of Thick as a Brick and another edited version of Heavy Horses and the Minstrel in the Gallery is edited as well. If you want a true best of Jethro Tull CD get their double CD titled \\"The best of Jethro Tull. You not only get more songs but they arent edited either. <br />If you want a short commercial version of Tull this is as good as any
B000B0WODA|5.0|Excellent follow up to a good album.  Has the same feel but shows a little more range and diversity.  It's rare that the last track is the best but \\"Outsiders\\" is my fave.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS A CLASSIC . BUT I AM GONNA TALK ABOUT THE ULTIMATE EDITION DVD OF DAWN OF THE DEAD <br /> <br />IMAGE: <br />The Anamorphic widescreen picture looks quite good. Color is excellent and detail is reasonably good for a low-budget picture of this type. The main defect is excessive edge enchancement ringing that's particularly noticeable in the outdoor sequences. Black levels are solid and little other artifacting is evident. <br /> <br />SOUND: <br />Not one, but four English tracks are provided, including the original mono, which sounds quite serviceable. The best of the other tracks is the DTS track, which has a broad and expansive soundstage, though not much in the way of surround effects. LFE is fairly light, and the sound is a bit piercing and shrill in all version. There are obvious source material limitations here, but the audio is free of significant noise and hiss and thus quite acceptable for its time. The european cut lacks the DTS audio track and the extended version only carries the origianl mono, but they're all of comparable quality to their theatrical cut equivalents. <br /> <br />SPECIAL FEATURES: <br />Full Motion menu with music <br />Scen Acess with 24 cues and remote access <br />Cast and Crew Biographies <br />Cast and Crew Filmographies <br />5 Original Trailers <br />5 TV Spots/Teasers <br />2 Documentaries <br />3 Feature/Episode comentaries 1)George A.

B0000AFONX|5.0|I am thouroughly shocked that people that hate the band can sway the rating. People that like the band and buy the CD should only post. I think that this is a great album. It is equally as moving as there other Cd's.  <br /> <br />Amy Lee has an absolutely beautiful voice.  <br />1.) Going Under- it mixes her awesome voice with powerful guitar and melodic drums. 9/10 <br />2.)Bring Me To Life- although overplayed, still a moving song that sends chills up my spine! 8/10 (due to it being overplayed) <br />3.)Everybody's Fool- I find my self singing this all the time. Its very catchy. 9/10 <br />4.)My Immortal- Just plain pretty, enough said. 9/10 <br />5.)Haunted- this is a good song, not spectacular, but good none the less 7/10 <br />6.)Tourniquet- fun to listen to as are all the songs 7/10 <br />7.)Imaginary- ah, take it or leave it 7/10 <br />8.)Taking over me- I personally love this song 9/10 <br />9.)Hello- very dark, sad 6/10 <br />10.)My Last Breath- this is a good mix of the melodic voice Amy has along with the power of the band behind her 9/10 <br />11.)Whisper- Friggin' awesome. I am constantly singing this! lol <br />12.)Farther Away- Another great song 9/10 <br /> <br />All in all, I can listen to every song. There is not one song I skip over. Each one is catchy and before you know it, you'll be singing them all (and trying your hardest to sing as lovely as Amy Lee can! LOL)
B000244EMO|5.0|I thought that this was a great movie. I recomend anybody that is a arnold fan or a action fan see this movie. I am gonna talk about the stuf about the new collectors dvd. <br /> <br />   IMAGE : <br />  This collector's edition has been issued in a rather dissapointing 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen tansfer, one that dosent sppear that all different (if at all) from the previous Predator dvd release, which means its fair to middlin at best. The quality of the print varies dramatically during its run, moving from jarringly awful and grainy Fox searchlight logo opening to edge halos to fequen bouts of specking and other minor detritus. When the transfer is on its game, it looks fairly good, with its solidly reproduced fleshtones offset by often soft background coloring. Its a tolerable tranfer, but this title deserves better treatment, image-wise. <br /> <br />                       SOUND: <br />The paring of Dolby Digital and DTS tracks is a nice touch, but it was already done on an earlier release, so we're not getting anything new here. The good news is that the're both pretty active mixes, and though you can dicker and bicker about the subtle differences. you will rumble quotient. The minimal dialogue is presentable, and the rear channels are aggressively mixed, so when the big fight sequences take place the mood is appropriatly frenetic.  The real winner, however, is the depth and fullness of the macho posturing of the Alan Silvestri score. A french 2.0 surround and a mono Spanish track are also included. <br /> <br />                        SPECIAL FEATURES: <br />Full motion menu with music <br />Scene Acess with 25 cues and remote acess <br />Subtitles/Captions in English,Spanish with remote acess        <br />2 Trailers featuring Alien vs. Predator, Alien Quadrilogy <br />1 deleted scenes <br />1 documentary  <br />12 featurettes <br />1 feature/Episode commentary by John Mctiernan <br />Packaging Tri-fold Amaray with slipcase <br />Picture Disc <br />2 discs<br />Layers: Dual <br />     <br />   The first disc has a audio commentary and it is pretty interesting <br /> <br />Disc TWO: <br /> <br /> If it Bleeds we can kill it\\" The making of Predator <br /> <br />  Classified Action <br /> <br />  The Unseen Arnold <br />   <br />  Old Painless <br /> <br />  The Life Inside : A tribute to Kevin Peter Hall <br /> <br />  Camouflage <br />  <br />  Welcome to the Jungle <br /> <br />  Character Design <br /> <br />  Predator Special Fx: This section offers a series of short pre-effects sequences <br /> <br />   Predator Red looking down <br />  <br />    Predator Red in Jungle <br /> <br />   Predator Red Main Walking Layer <br /> <br />   Camouglage Moth Test <br /> <br />   Camouflage Effect Layers <br /> <br />  Fleeing the Predator(This is the only deleted scene) <br /> <br />   These are just three scenes that are considered outtakes(dont know why) <br /> <br />   Chameleon <br />   <br />    Building A Trap <br /> <br />    Sliding downhill <br />     <br />    This disc also includes a Predator Profile made up of nine screens of text and artwork explaining the dreadlocked alien's specialized weaponry. <br /> <br />   Then there is also a Photo Gallery <br /> <br />    AND LAST is a trailer of Alien Quadrilogy <br /> <br />     THAT IS ALL THAT IS IN THIS DVD! <br />   THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEW! <br />HOPE YOU ENJOY THE DVD !
1932100385|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  There are quite a few chapters before he even gets to China where it becomes clear that he is anti protein.  He did 10 years of studies on how one protein, casein, affects the growth of one kind of tumor, liver cancer from aflatoxin and uses that to make all kinds of judgements about what people should or should not eat.   <br /> <br />As the Weston A. Price Foundation points out, some forms of casein, because of how they are dried, are carcinogenic.  They also pointed out a fact that Campbell ignored, that those who ate the most saturated fat were protected from cancers and diseases of degeneration.   <br /> <br />It's a good read if you want to justify being a vegan, but if you really want answers, it's a waste of money.
B000006MS3|5.0|You want a short review?   Here it is:  this is art for art's sake, Kate doesn't stoop to her audience, she elevates them.  Relentless torturing of the (then cutting-edge) Fairlight CMI married to imaginative and lyrical storytelling.  Forget everything you think pop music should be and let Kate entertain you!  While \\"Hounds of Love\\" was a crowd pleaser, \\"The Dreaming\\" opened doors for other artists and gained Kate a status amongst her peers that is unequaled by any other artist to this day.  For those who think Bjork invented \\"quirky\\", think again.  One of the essential albums and that's all you need to know.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I bought Franz Ferdinand's debut CD the day it came out. I didn't like it right away, but after 5 or 6 spins I totally got into it and thought that Franz was a blast of much needed fresh air in the putrid field of American pop-rock radio.<br /><br />So, I bought Franz Ferdinand's \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" the day it came out and didn't like it right away either. But, after spinning this disc for 2 weeks, I can honestly tell you that this record is AMAZING. FF has beaten the so-called \\"sophomore jinx\\" by miles and miles.<br /><br />The songs \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\", \\"Walk Away\\" and \\"Fade Together\\" are worth the purchase of this entire CD alone. These songs are absolutely superb on the highest levels. Period. And nevermind that at least half a dozen other songs are awesome as well, including \\"Villain\\", \\"The Outsiders\\", \\"The Fallen\\" and \\"What You Meant\\".<br /><br />Franz Ferdinand has made an heavy statement with \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" and they're not taking any crap from you.<br /><br />Get it!
B00006LI4D|5.0|When I first looked up the album, I was surprised not to see a drummer listed. My assumption was it was going to be kind of boring without somebody like Jeff Hamilton, Karriem Riggins, or Greg Hutchinson(former Ray Brown drummers) in the ensemble. How wrong I was! <br /> <br />Monty Alexander and Russell Malone are just awesome on this recording. Malone has such stylistic range but still maintains a rich tone. Alexander has softer approach that is equally playful. And of course, Ray Brown is always amazing. <br /> <br />Definitely worth purchasing for anyone who likes Jazz, Ray Brown, or just wants some relaxed listening with a swinging trio.
0790740443|3.0|I didn't expect to like this sf/f action movie when I picked it up, but it surprised me by having quite a bit of heart to it. There are still too many things going up in fire for my taste, but the characters are good and the trash planet of Arcadia is beautifully shot. All of the actors turn in good performances. Of special note are Jason Isaacs as the sleazy Colonel Mekum, Gary Busey as Captain Church, Jason Scott Lee as Caine, the super soldier, James Black as Riley (he has one, maybe two lines total in the whole movie yet conveys so much through his eyes and face that you come away feeling that you know something about his character), Connie Nielsen as Sandra, Brenda Wehle as Hawkins, and Sean Pertwee as Mace. It's a good ensemble cast, and while no one performance overwhelms the others, I was quite impressed with Sean Pertwee's turn as Mace. He has a quiet presence on screen that makes you want to watch him and see what he does.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay have gotten too big. They play huge venues with visual effects (the horror!). A few of their new songs are similar to past work. They borrowed a Kraftwerk melody for \\"Talk\\". Guy Berryman cut his hair. These are all nitpicks that are recycled ad nauseum (except the last one of course) simply because the band is so successful. But they are just that--nitpicks--that don't have anything to do with the quality of music on X&Y, which in my opinion is quite good.
B000002GYN|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable (if not the most) EAGLES studio albums they ever made. There's no filler on this baby! I promise! &quot;Take it easy&quot; and &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; are definitely top notched songs, but everything on this release is in my opinion a 10/10 rating. I used to do a lot of drinking listening to &quot;Chug all night&quot;. Just a killer drinking song! &quot;Take the Devil&quot; is also one of my all time favorite EAGLES songs. When people talk about the great debut albums I don't usually hear many talk about this one, but in my eyes it's definitely one of the greatest. Just buy this great album. Get ready for a real treat.
B000AARKO4|2.0|Yet again, Hollywood's political correctness seeks the almighty $.This is Hollywood BS at it's worst. Chritian Europe was under attack from the Muslim hodes. By now, we should know what Muslim jihad is. This movie is nothing more than the typically leftist, anti-US, politcally correct, Hollywood re-writing of history. If you watch this, read your history! Two stars for cinamatography.
0060574216|1.0|Wow, this edition of \\"Dr.\\" Gray's work was released even after his PhD has been debunked.  And yet he still appears as \\"John Gray, PhD\\" on the cover of his book!  He bought his PhD from a diploma mill.  He's a fraud, a charlatan, a huckster. <br /> <br />I'd like to think that after a man who rose to fame peddling himself as a relationship guru -- while using false credentials to bolster his claims -- would find himself humbled after his PhD was revealed to be a fraud.  Apparently, John Gray lacks humility and basic human decency, as well as a PhD. <br /> <br />What John Gray has is the ability to tell people what they want to hear.  Maybe he should sell a diet & exercise book too, and tell us we can eat all the chocolate we want, and sit on our fat behinds while watching 7 hours of TV, followed by 5 hours in online chat rooms, and we'll get slim & trim by doing so! <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Madame Beige, PhD, B.S.A., XyZ, PdQ
0307276902|5.0|I am a Mother who lost her son to a drug overdose I highly  <br />reccomend this book to all who are recovering from addiction of any kind.I never knew until i read this book how devistating <br />it is to be at the mercy of these Demons. all family members   <br />Who have felt the pain of loss ,due to addiction this will open your eyes to what the people you love go through .no other book i have read brings this pain to light.James Frey lived to tell us what our loved ones could not.I donated my copy to the recovery house in my town with hope it will help save one person.
B00009EIQE|5.0|This is very overlooked new cd from Buddy, playing acoustic. True blues. Best effort.
B00000272N|4.0|Many heavy bands are out there,in my opinion though there is only a good handful of them and Alice In Chains is one of them.<br /><br />Alice In Chains is  no doubt the heaviest grunge band out( doesn't mean the best though).Just think of them as metal.Anyways,\\"Facelift\\", is a very good overall album.Though many casual listeners will pick this up for the first two songs.As they are the most familiar radio play wise, but actually end up enjoying the rest of the songs.<br /><br />Now even though \\"We Die Young\\" and \\"Man In The Box\\" are two fairly big songs don't forget you still have 10 more enjoyable songs.<br /><br />\\"Sea Of Sorrow\\" \\"Confusion\\" and \\"Love Hate Love\\"<br />are three other solid songs that are on this album.Though you<br />may notice the whole album seems a slight bit lighter after the first two tracks.\\"I Can't Remember\\" is my favorite as it is probly to many others, opening with a chilling acoustic intro and ending with heavily distorted guitars this is AiC prime.<br /><br />Basically if you are caught up in the whole grunge era buy this album.If you like metal buy this album.If you just like overall decent music buy this album.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|This is it. Another album this year. Quick listening and what. No just slow down. This is quality music and you feel Buddy, he is tru, Nothing but the blues man. All songs are pure blues and he is unprecedented King. I have all cds with him and this one will be on my top shelve. Do the do do man.
0440418569|1.0|I am, thank goodness, finished with this last book in the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series. Whew! Too gloomy, too wordy, and frankly, I wound up doing a combination of reading/skimming about 3/4ths of the book. I only hope any of the kids reading the books haven't lost someone to death, because the world Pullman portrays of the afterlife is just plain horrible, and so NOT the way it most likely is, in my opinion, it would be truly, deeply, completely dismal and frightening to them. \\"Harpies\\" whispering endlessly in the ears of the dead reminding them over and over of every single bad thing they did in life? Geesh. Kids wondering where their mothers and fathers are and wondering if they miss them? Again, GEESH! I did manage to find a whopping 2 whole paragraphs at the end I could actually agree with the author on, regarding how we should try and live our lives, and really, I think if this guy would sit down and actually think about it, his particular views about it don't seem to be at all in opposition to what he purports to have a conflict with. I did notice he very carefully left out any mention of the staggeringly unselfish and loving Grace God affords us in the form of Jesus Christ. Hmmm...wonder why? Could it be it would have completely negated his views?  <br /> <br />
B0001GF2DS|3.0|Keep in mind, this review refers to the (Extended Version Collector's Set) specifically, NOT the movie itself.  A review of each \\"Special Feature\\" that had something that--in my eyes--deserved some criticism, even if it's something small.      \\"Special Features\\"    -Commentary by film historian Richard Schickel:  Personally, I wished they would of had the people who made the movie do the commentary--Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Mickey Knox, maybe a seperate one for Alberto Grimaldi.  Clint Eastwood said he wanted to watch it sometime again anyways.    -Newly restored, extended three-hour version:  And that is all that's included.  URRGH!  It's sooo long, they edited it for a reason! I wish they would have put the three versions on this DVD--the Original American Cut, Italian Cut, and the cut that played at the Roman Premiere...just like they did for the Beauty and the Beast DVD!!!!!!    -\\"Leone's West\\" making-of documentary and \\"The Leone Style\\" documentary:  These are so poorly edited and underdeveloped.  They have Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Alberto Grimaldi, and some film history guy.  I wish they would've gotten everyone they could find, still alive, English-speaking or not (subtitles!), to talk about their little experiences in making the film.  I would have had everyone, from the little Mexican boy in the beginning to the dying soldier in the end, to say something.  These documentaries weren't half as good as the ones on the James Bond DVDs.    -\\"Il Maestro: Ennio Morricone and The Good, the Bad & the Ugly\\":  What was up with this?  It's just horrible. Some dorky Movie Soundtrack Music Scholar with a lot of make-up just talking about the movie's music.  I wish they could have had the actor's opinions of the music, but also, more importantly, Ennio Morricone.  He's still alive and making music and I would read English subtitles to actually know what his inspiration for the music was.    -Collectible theatrical mini-posters:  These are neat to flip through on the DVD but the poster cards are useless.  I wish they put in a mini-version of the American theatrical poster, so I could put something on my wall.    -8 Page Booklet:  Roger Ebert's review of the movie. I think you can look it up online for free.  It's just a waste of paper putting a printed copy of it in there...plus we all agree the movie's great anyway...    All in all, I wish I hadn't spent $30 on this cut that is too long with below average Special Features for a Special-Edition-Collector's-Set.  Don't take me wrong, there are a few special features on the DVD that are neat, but not worth the money.  The best part, honestly, is the new remastered 5.1 surround sound.  Still though, I wish I had spent $3 less on the boxed trilogy that still keeps the original nostalgic feeling of seeing them 35 years ago in American theaters.
B000A3XY9Q|5.0|Okay. Granted...most of you are here because you are a fan of this terrific cult classic. But for those that are unfamiliar with this flick, don't make the same mistake that I made almost 20 years ago now when I first thought about renting this at my local video store.<br /><br />The mistake I made was not renting it. It was the title of the movie that scared me away...the word \\"evil\\" to be matter of fact. I was sure that it was just one of those poorly acted shock-value festivals of \\"evil\\" people, zombies, whatever, doing really mean, torturous things to others. Well, I finally rented it sometime in like 1989 after it was on the shelves for a year, and, boy, was I wrong about thinking that this would be a bad movie.<br /><br />The flick starts out with a guy and his girl heading to a supposedly deserted cabin in a remote forest. And the horror and hilarity then begin. Upon first view, I didn't even realize the deliberate humor that was going on until the infamous hand possesion. Henrietta's appearance then makes for a good scary several minutes, and is then lightened to one of the most humorous moments in horror film history...let's just say it's eye-popping.<br /><br />There are chills and laughs all throughout this classic, even on the second, third, etc viewings. I suggest that you will watch more than once, because, as with me, once you realize this is as much a comedy as it is a horror flick, you will want to look for the jokes that you might have mistaken previously for campyness.<br /><br />A must for any film collector.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Foo.  I don't think I need to say anything else.  Thanks.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|One the most underrated records made by EC. Stand out tracks: <br />Same old blues, Just like a prisoner (one of his best studio guitar solo's), Never make a cry (stunning synth.guitar), Forever man (strongest single since layla).
B000000WJZ|5.0|I must say, that after purchasing \\"Gish\\" and hanging out with my music snob circle of friends, that you couldn't get better than that first Pumpkins album.  But I think I was wrong, because I actually like Siamese Dream better.  Don't get me wrong, Gish is a classic too, but this album is fantastic all the way around.  You listen to it and you easily begin to realize Corgan's musical genius.  This album, to me, has some pretty obvious metal influences, probably moreso than Gish, and Corgan really tears up that sing string on quite a few of these songs.  It's always good to hear that from a band that emerged during the 90s.  My favorite cuts from this album are: \\"Cherub Rock,\\" \\"Disarm,\\" \\"Sweet Sweet\\" and \\"Luna\\" (an ending double-threat).  This album rocks so hard, you don't even know.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Stop the critics!! <br />I have heard them all about how they sound like who and what album they are comparing them two or what two albums they used to mix this fine example of jams.  Also Opeth is not burning up or selling out in any way.  Ghost Reveries is a fine example of who Opeth is...they dont stay in just one place.  Opeth have the qualities that every band should have.  For example, if a band just goes hard core through out an album, believe me that is such a bore.  What two Opeth albums sound the same?...none. <br />  I think, in my opinion that Opeth is just trying out new sounds...true 3 of the songs sound like they came out of the Damnation album, but then again that would be a continuation of that Damnation album.  Where is Opeth album going after this controversial of sort album?...who knows and who cares..it is their uniqueness of change that makes them who they are, quite simply the best band out there right now.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This is a great modern rock album.  Grohl is a great frontman who writes great riffs and lyrics, and great acoustic songs as well.  Dave Grohl flippin' rules!  This album is flippin' sweet!  Grohl has some sick talent, I'll tell you what.  It's a great album all the way through.  Foo Fighters really know how to keep good rock music alive!  Buy the album.  'Nuff said.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|I don't remember seeing the name Ross Robinson (aka Batman) anywhere in the CD book. Not saying it's not there, I just got the CD. However, if it's not... that's the only downfall. All Roadrunner aficionados would probably agree. To hear all of these great band members teamed up with others from the Roadrunner roster is so great. Of course, I wish they could have brought back some of Earth Crisis, Biohazard, etc. Again, the work that they've completed is great and I hope it don't take another 25 years for this to concur. BUY THE CD AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN! Also, read my other CD reviews.
0385513755|5.0|I loved the story and especially loved the pictures that coincided with the author's description of certain places/artwork/etc. I think without the illustrations, I would not have enjoyed the book as much (as I do not know many artworks and buildings referenced to in the book). I highly recommend getting the illustrated version if, like me, you also are not familiar with artwork and buildings
B000070WJE|5.0|It is rare for me to go outside of my normal little world of music. But when I bought this album, I could not stop listening to it. It still haunts me even when I am not listening to it.  <br /> <br />This has to be one of the best albums ever made by any singer. The lyrics are put together very, very well. Most of the songs are autobiographical which is rare to find in this day and age. The music is performed by some of the best musicians ever. Listen to the pianist on 'Feel' and you will see what I mean. <br /> <br />Overall, an excellent album and I recommend everyone listen to it more than once. <br /> <br />And a song about a monkey?? Talk about hilarious!!!
B0002DRDBE|5.0|This DVD is amazing.  The extras are definitely worth the purchase, the Q&A alone had me laughing even after it was over.  The extended edition is really no big deal, there's some good stuff, but mostly bulk; the original ending is a piece of crap anyway and even Kevin admits it. <br /> <br />A must buy for anyone who enjoys Kevin Smith's work.
B000001FG1|5.0|This was the only Kiss solo  CD I had for a long time. I'm an Ace fan and had to buy this when the LP came out. Fractured Mirror, Rip It Out and New York Groove are the best tunes on this Cd but also of the other member's Cds. Gene, Paul and Peter had some highlights on their releases but not as many as Ace. <br />This is well worth the money.
0525948023|5.0|what is with the slandering character reviews?  This sounds like a gossip column.    How can you take these slandering reviews seriously?  How do you know they're true when you can tell they're coming from a place of fear, hostility, and jealousy?      Eckhart seems like a very private person.  He is not even doing a book tour to promote A New Earth, so he obviously doesn't care about fame, publicity and money.    You can get a free interview DVD from his website so you can all judge his character yourself and quit writing here about it.  This is about the message in the book folks!    The book I found to be very good.  A wonderful, truthful message.  No need to bring the man into it.  That is all ego and distracts from the message.
B000B8I8X2|5.0|From the long standing history of the Roadrunner label comes this great idea to make a compilation that includes artists from many of their past and current artists. From that group of 50+ artists comes an 18 track CD that is dressed to impress, with alot of the talent that has made metal what it is today. From King Diamond and Type O Negative, to Trivium and Still Remains, Roadrunner boasts one extravagant roster of musicians and music writers. The four captains were absolutely impressive.<br /><br />Although, Rob Flynn stayed more on the thrash and heavier metal side of things, captains Dino Cazares and Joey Jordison sported much more far ranging tracks (from a mid-nineties alternative to death metal). Matt Heafy's tracks were absolutely impressive to hear. He wrote a track in the style of King Diamond, a black metal masterpiece that made me say \\"huh? Whoa!\\", a southern hard rock style track (with a rather unimpressive Jessie Leach fronting), and a very unique, almost Pennywise sounding track. I give huge props to teams Heafy, Jordison, and Cazares for adding a hell of a lot to listen to.<br /><br />I am a fan of the much heavier stuff on the CD, so I focused more on tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13. Come to find out, the whole CD is equally impressive. There is one track that I have a really big problem with, but its purely political and doesn't destroy the fact that the track was well written and that it is only the opinion of the people who wrote it, and whatever audience they were attempting to cater to. Anyway, this CD is one of the greatest ideas ever invented by a record label. Plus, it turned out to be one great CD. I think that is enough to spend your hard earned money on it.<br /><br />I think that Century Media needs to take a hint from this idea. Think of the bands they would be putting together; Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquillity, God Forbid, Watch Them Die, Soilwork, Lacuna Coil, the mighty Shadows Fall, Candiria, and so many others. Are you listening CM. Or, here's another idea...since Century Media and Roadrunner cross so many paths on the road, why not combine their best metal acts for something like this. Just a couple of thoughts. Anyway, buy this CD, BUY IT NOW!!!e you listening CM. Or, here's another idea...since Century Media and Roadrunner cross so many paths on the road, why not combine their best metal acts for something like this. Just a couple of thoughts.

B00005JNZP|3.0|Actor turned director Liev Schreiber (The Sum of All Fears) does an above average screen version of the novel, Everything Is Illuminated, by author Jonathan Safran Foer.  This tale of journey and self discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enlightens the soul.  <br /> <br />Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who has seen his grandfather, Safran, pass away.  Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic ziplock bags to display them on his wall.  Safran gives Jonathan an old picture showing a young Safran standing next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago.  Thus Jonathan commences on a long journey to locate this mystery woman in the Ukraine not knowing if she is still alive.  He enlists the help of a brash, young tour guide named Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to drive him to his goal.  At first the trip hits dead ends and false leads, but as the group nears its target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past ghosts of a nonexistent town.  There, they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn.   <br /> <br />This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors.  At times, the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film.  The title itself is a play on self discovery.  This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past, and his past ironically involves his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well. It's a tale of bonding over the long haul and the guilt one must carry for a lifetime.  By the end of the film, these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizingand also cleansing the soul.  It's also about one's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past.  Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light.  Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told.   <br /> <br />The story is deceptively simple.  It functions as a road trip movie (like The Straight Story) combined with an interesting mystery story.  It really involves a great many layers of emotions and subplots that range from the past to the present.  The ending is a bit surreal with its dj vu feeling.   <br /> <br />Elijah Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Here, he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show.  Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively.  Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion.   <br /> <br />The spare music score by Paul Cantelon is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the film.  The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly.  The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath. <br /> <br />The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental.  We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivations are.  Likewise, Jonathan's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man.  At times, the film feels a little downbeat and depressing as more horrific revelations are exposed.  But these are minor criticisms of what is a good, introspective story withgood performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure.  That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future.   <br />
B00006LLLN|5.0|I ordered this CD set after having heard it on a friends iPod.  It was as a result of that introduction Alison Krauss' music that I've started investing in her other CDs that she has out.  This set is one of the better live performances I've heard from anyone.
B00005QXDD|5.0|For those who are puzzled by the backwards message you heard on yer CD & tape copies between \\"Karate\\" & \\"Rock Your Socks Off\\", go out & see if yer mom&Pop or small-chain record store carries a 2-LP vinyl copy of the D's album (that's what I own & am proud of it) so you can unscramble that backwards message. If you have no turntable, go out & buy one.  WHAT?! yer store only carries CD players?! Check da thrift store for a working turntable! <br />so ROCK HARD with the D ON VINYL!!!!
B00004TEUX|5.0|Peter Maag was a superb conductor who pitifully has been forgotten for a remarkable audience. His sumptuous and noble style, the perfect articulation of the harmonic languages, color tonal, mercurial lyricism and adequate melodic balance, fit out to play Mendelssohn a colorist composer.<br /><br />Herder and Goethe in literature and the composers Mendelssohn and Bruch were perhaps, the most enthusiastic artists engaged by this dreamingly land.<br /><br />According Donald Tovey the second musical motive in the First Movement of the \\"Scottish\\" has been to his mind the most expressive and inspired melody ever written. The certain is that this Symphony remains not only as one of the most expansive and delirious Symphonic works ever written. Mendelssohn 's muse reached a peak hard to climb even by himself. We would have to wait for the Fifth Symphony to enjoy such enraptured inspiration and magic spell.<br /><br />I have to remark that version is after the unbeatable Munch 's Boston Symphony, the most expressive and eloquent version that I have listened. The pureness and grace; the charm and lyricism literally float as a cloud around the members of the orchestra of the London Symphony.<br /><br />In the Hebrides; we must employ a well known French expression: Chapeaux!. It is simply overwhelming. Elegant phrasing and  aristocratic conception conform this beauty Overture.<br /><br />Midnight summer 's dream finds two serious rivals: Ferenc Fricsay and Rafael Kubelik. But a deserved third place behind these two mesmerizing readings definitively confirms the status that many times we use to forget around the figure of this legendary director.

I loved the way this book reads, and it's a great one to pick up and open to any page, sure to get enlightenment from any one of them! I've highlighted so much in this book.

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|Love it, Love it, LOVE it! OK, now that I got that out of my system, I'll tell you this: listening to this cd is like being at a lovely beach on vacation and being deeply in love. There is something endorphin-raising about the songs on this album, and it makes you feel as though life is looking rosy. It's not a sappy, superficial happy feeling, it is a deep contentment: well, drat, it's difficult to explain. The only time you start feeling sad is when you remember that George Harrison is no longer on this earth. Otherwise, this is a happy cd. If you want angry, if you want dreary, get another cd. (The one and only song that really doesn't belong is \\"Faster.\\" I wish that could have been on \\"Cloud Nine\\" with Jeff Lynne producing it. I loved Russ Titleman and George Harrison's production of every other song, though. Very \\"Guitar-centric.\\" )<br /><br /> George Harrison wrote some of the most beautiful love songs EVER. People mistakenly have this impression of him as the weird Hare Krishna Beatle who wrote all that w00-w00 sitar music (which I enjoy, frankly) but I'm tellin' ya, this man wrote some gorgeous love-music! Maybe his spirituality contributed to his ability to appreciate romantic love and life's simple joys as \\"Good Gifts;\\" and how fortunate we are to be able to listen to his interpretation of those gifts.<br /><br />\\"Dark Sweet Lady\\" is sublime. \\"Your Love is Forever\\" made me stop what I was doing and just listen in astonishment. \\"Blow Away\\" reminds us how easy it is to let go of a bad mood, and forget about it, as easy as warm winds blowing away a cold, dreary day.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes the Moon\\"  has a totally different feeling than \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"  I'll explain in my pathetic way: You know how you sit outside at late summer dusk, and the sky gets progressively darker and this big full moon climbs up slowly 'til the day's heat is gone and the balmy breezes start wafting around all these summery fragrances, and it's suddenly turned into a beautiful summer night?<br /><br />Yeah. THAT'S what the song is like.<br />Yeah. THAT'S what the song is like.
0307276902|5.0|This book is gripping in the reality of pain and suffering and how to try to overcome it. The throws of addiction and the pain to overcome felt chilling while reading it. It's one of the best books I've read. Really an outstanding book!
B00005UKE0|5.0|I own the original on vinyl, and I am so glad that this remastered cd version was released. This is not to imply that the vinyl version was sub-standard, but, WOW! I can hear things on this one that I could not on the original. What I wish I could hear more of, however, is George Harrison's voice and guitar work, and less of the Phil Spector \\"Wall of Sound,\\" particularly on \\"Let It Down,\\" and \\"Run of the Mill.\\" Listening to the demo version of \\"Let it Down\\" in all its sultry simplicity, then going back to the produced version, I felt Phil over-did it on the chorus. Kinda like getting into a real nice smooching session and then having your Dad throw cold water on you. But that might just be me: I have always loved George Harrison's unique, melliflous, sexy voice.<br /><br />  \\"Run of the Mill\\" starts with that crisp guitar intro, and has great lyrics, just excellent, they read like a poem. I don't understand the use of that horn in the song. Maybe Phil Spector's style just isn't as much to my liking now, as it was when I first heard the album as a young teen.<br /><br />  But those little nitpicky items notwithstanding, this cd is still a masterpiece. \\"Beware of Darkness\\" is my favorite song on this album, it is pure perfection. \\"Hear Me Lord\\" is hauntingly pleading,totally astounding in its power. You can hear the smile in Harrison's voice on  \\"Apple Scruffs,\\" it is almost impossible not to smile along and tap your feet.  Spector did a great job with \\"My Sweet Lord\\", the 2000 version is nice, but not as joyous. \\"I Live For You\\" was a lovely surprise! I enjoyed reading the comments by George Harrison, and looking at the new photos.
B00070Q7VO|4.0|Michael looks like a young Buddy Greco or Bobby Darin with this CD. Some great songs and interpretations like \\"Try a little tenderness\\". But why he has to copy and use Nelson Riddle arrangements? I think this CD was over-produced. Micheal's version of Quando, quando is terrible and sleepy. But still four stars.

0679720200|5.0|I sometimes wonder, why assign this great novel to high school children?  It's a handbook of perversion, in a sense.  That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but how many nowadays have read the book?  No wonder there are incidents like Columbine every day in the papers.  Young boys (sadly, they are always boys) read THE STRANGER and decide, if Meursault could commit a murder in far off Algeria, why can't I do the same here in snowy Colorado (or wherever).<br /><br />We all suffer from existential angst, sad to say, and this book cleverly pins down the five points of fear, the points by which a good school psychologist should be able to recognize that a potential Columbine is likely to happen within a year's time.  The five points include-look at the way Meursault deals with Marie, his lovely and complaisant girlfriend.  Although he says he is attracted to her, he often leaves her for long stretches of time.  He is disaffected, as the psychologists say.  Camus isn't writing a medical textbook, more like a novel, so much of this ennui is a product of his own literary imagination.  A few years later Roland Barthes took pen to hand to compose WRITING DEGREE ZERO, in which he famously divided the author's tools into three broad sections-language (for we all must write in language), style (which individuates us from our peers), and what he called \\"ecriture\\" in response to Sartre, Camus and other existentialist novelist for whom modernism was a disastrous wrong turn in humanity's social progress toward the Good.<br /><br />Another of the five points of fear comes in Meursault's interaction with his neighbor, Raymond.  Is it me or do these guys seem more French than Algerian?  Today we would recognize THE STRANGER as an example of the colonial system gone berserk.  If you are living in occupied territory, you can't expect to feel very stable.  Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, telling the story of POLTERGEIST, picked up on some of Camus' themes when they set their poltergeist-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.  What is difficult for Meursault is to make a decision.  In this he reminds us of Hamlet, and as we know, the stature of Shakespeare's Hamlet was at an all-time high in the immediate postwar era, what with the Olivier film, etc.  His eternally questioning figure rang a bell with veterans and citizens weary of endless war.  For Meursault, to act or not to act are pretty much the same.  How to detect a difference?  Often we look for signs from the outside world, for example, watching a fly cross a table.  If it zigzags this way, we pull the trigger.  If it flies away, lives are spared.  Think of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as another cinematic analogue to Camus' STRANGER and its five points of fear.  Just the fly creeping around Jack Elam's face in the opening sequence gives you the creeps, for violence and terror depend on which way the fly falls.-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.

B000AARKOO|3.0|Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie with an epic length. The acting is good, with many great actors. The plot and costumes are excellent and sets the stage. The battle scenes are choreographed and well shot. I'm no fan of big epics, but Kingdom was a good movie.
B000AQBA1W|5.0|The Corrs have done it again, just when you thought they couldn't get any better, they out do themselves!  HOME, their new album is simply BRILLIANT!  With songs like \\"Old Hag\\" to \\"Haste to the Wedding\\" to get you dancing and songs like \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" and \\"Peggy Gordan\\" to help you over come a relationship, this album has something for everyone, of all ages.  Sharon Corr, the bands violinist and back up vocalist also takes front stage for the song \\"Dimming of the Day\\" where she sings lead, her voice is truly impressive and her debut is a GREAT success!  Andrea Corr's melodic voice goes right through you, and sent chills down my spine the entire album through.  This is the MUST HAVE album of the century!  5 out of 5 stars for sure!!
B000A88F22|5.0|When \\"Chaotic\\" first aired on UPN, I was just silent with shock at how down-to-earth Britney Spears really is. It's actually refreshing to see a celeb who doesn't have an inflated ego and can just be herself! Even if there were times when I thought she needed to ride the short tour bus: \\"They look like boobs... They're my KNEES! HAAHAHA\\" *slaps forehead* <br /> <br />Alright, here's the review: This set includes all SIX episodes of Chaotic as well as some pretty cool extras. Personally, most of the DELETED SCENES should have been aired instead some of the stupid, asinine stuff they chose. For example, in one of the deleted scenes Kevin actually mentions Shar Jackson (his pregnant wife) for the first time and explains to Britney that he has a kid. It shows the situation in a totally different light as it shows Brit's sympathy toward Shar until Kevin assures her it's been over \\"for a long time.\\" <br /> <br />And I couldn't stop laughing during the one episode, \\"Magic Happens,\\" 'cause Britney is still being goofy when she's genuinely scared at the French-Spanish border: <br /> <br />Britney: \\"We're being interrogated. Therre's a dawg... he gon' get on my bus! If anyone finds this tape, I just want to be remembered as a good person.\\" <br /> <br />Hey, I'm a Brit fan so I was loving it--it was cute. Just plain, unscripted footage of Britney while she was on tour. <br /> <br />Although I liked the show, well most of the show (especially the special Wedding episode), JIVE didn't do such a hot job with the Special Features. I mean, most of Britney's DVDs are jam-packed with videos, interviews, and other cool things but this set included the videos for \\"Do Somethin'\\" and \\"Someday (I Will Understand), both awesome songs but why didn't they include Chris Cox's \\"BS Megamix\\" video? <br /> <br />The Bonus CD was a'ight... not the best bonus disc I've heard from her. The MP3s of both \\"Chaotic\\" and \\"Someday\\" have been available on the internet for at least 6 months and I can't speak for everyone but the 3rd track, \\"Mona Lisa,\\" was just annoying. I heard she had some kind of fascination with the Mona Lisa painting a while back but she never publicly explained it... as a result, that song's a head-scratcher. <br /> <br />So, after all is said and done, I just have a couple things to iterate: 1) If you are NOT a Britney Spears fan, don't buy this Britney DVD; try \\"In The Zone\\" or \\"Live and More!\\" 2) Don't review this package unless you've bought it 'cause it's not just episodes of \\"Chaotic\\" (3 hours of additional footage) and 3) If you're a fan and you're afraid of buying this set 'cause of the bad reviews, take a chance and decide for yourself--it's cheaper than her other DVD sets and I didn't expect to like it AT ALL, but what can I say? It grew on me! Like fungus. <br /> <br />Hope this helped, y'all!
B000A7S4B0|5.0|I was intrigued by the plain black cover of this cd. I had never heard of the band and I read the rightious, rambling comments on the LP-looking back of the cd and decided to give it a try. I like new and unique bands. This is by by far the cleanest, focused, (mostly) acoustic album I have heard in a long time. I think it is infused with sounds of The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Band and Bob Dylan. This band is amazing. I have listened to it over and over and find myself liking it more each time. It has a southern, gospel oriented rock feeling to it. It is heart-felt and moving, rocking and rolling. I have listened to clips here, of their previous 2 albums and could not believe this is the same band! I can say I would not have been inclined to buy their first 2 albums if I had not gotten this one first. I find their evolution amazing. The other 2 albums sound nothing like this. I look forward to their next album and hope they evolve again! It is about time a band like B.R.M.C stepped forward and broke free and evolved with each album and not just put out the same sound, but different lyrics each release. Remember The Beatles-- they evolved with each album. Praise and thanks to B.R.M.C for stepping up to the plate and hitting a home run. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

Although increadibly detailed, Dallaire writes almost poetically when describing his personal feelings toward the country, the people, the genocide and the Western indifference to what was happening.  <br />Romeo Dallaire has not held back at all, he has not been afraid of what his collegues would think, and for that I call him a hero.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|Great blues album from the inspirational birthday boy Mr. King. Standout track is definately \\"All Over Again\\" with Mark Knopfler and its nice to hear a modernised \\"Thrill Is Gone\\" with Clapton's lovely sparce lines. <br /> <br />BB don't need to do duets but when he does the result is a welcomed addition to any new or old blues fans collection.
B000AARKO4|2.0|I am an enthusiastic movie watcher...but this movie was just another one of those 2000 Historic genre movies that only has battles. Maybe a \\"guy\\" thing but I'm tired of movies just going from one battle to the next. I want a story line which this movie didn't have. Yes, there was a story there but not clear and rather improbable. <br /> <br />Good costumes and scenery. <br /> <br />I kept waiting for something really bad to happen to the son after his proposed wife said he needed to do a little evil for the greater good. Nothing happened except he fought another battle and went home. <br /> <br />This high profile movie with good actors (wasted) falls in line with Troy, Alexander and all those huge movies. Just one battle to the next and snippets of dialogue here and there. <br /> <br />Bought this movie, but giving it away because it isn't something I'd watch again or give shelf space.
B00005GL0P|5.0|If you were between the ages of 16 to 22 when this album was released you would probably feel this was their best album ever. I was 18. It was a coming of age album. Most of the people that i grew up with felt the same way ( and the ones i am still in touch with still do). My only criticism is that the album had such meaning for me that I can never completely get used to the British version. After so many times on the turntable, the order of the songs from the American version is forever engraved in my brain. I miss the songs that are left out (I'm A Loser), though i do not dislike the ones that have been added ( especially Nowhere Man and If I Needed Someone). I agree with most reviewers who find the song Girl to be a masterpiece. All in all, most boomers would give it a 5.
B000AARKOO|2.0|This is no Blackhawk Down, Gladiator or Blade Runner. It's not even Hannibal or GI Jane or (heaven forbid) 1492. <br /> <br />Christians are for the most part, bad. Moslems are good and you best get your roman tails out of Jerusalem.  <br /> <br />With that said, Orlando Bloom cannot carry a movie, you don't care about most of the characters. Christian religious zealots are bad (I feel the need to repeat it because the movie certainly does ad nauseum). The script and the story are light brush strokes on what had the potential to be a lovely colorful canvas.  <br /> <br />If you can suspend your tolerance for indifferent writing and some poorly casted parts - I am sure many will enjoy the special effects. <br /> <br />While Ridley Scott has successfully created other worlds you feel a part of, this isn't one for me. <br /> <br />Rent, don't Buy.
1400032717|4.0|As an adult reader of this book I admired the author's skill in crafting and revealing a protagonist with such a unique outlook (and one that evidently rings true for many people). The plot is artfully devised to convey some very interesting character studies of the autistic \\"author\\" of the story and his parents. In reading this book I found much to consider about the nature of what it means to be human, humane, \\"normal,\\" functional, and brave, among other things, and I concur with the many other reviewers here who found this book to be ironic, poignant, resonant, and of true literary worth.    But as a parent confronted with this book being assigned to my child in school, I feel that the following facts about the book should be made known in advance to parents in considering whether this material is appropriate for their own children:    The novel is filled throughout (from page 4 through page 214) with extreme profanity including the nastiest four-letter words which cannot be reproduced here without getting my review deleted. The rationale for this is that the protagonist has a photographic memory and no ability to censor incoming sensory stimulation, so the inclusion of this language simulates a replication of his surroundings as he moves through his lower-class neighborhood and around the transportation system from his home and into London. Also included are Christopher's uncensored musings about toileting situations and \\"doing sex.\\" Christopher is a physically chaste \\"emotional innocent,\\" but this book deals with adult subjects viewed through his eyes, including infidelity, a marital breakup, arguments among foul-mouthed adults, and Christopher finding pornography in his father's bedroom. Violent scenes include Christopher discovering a neighborhood dog murdered with a pitchfork, Christopher and his father physically fighting, and Christopher hitting a policeman and being arrested.    I found it telling that in his interview with [...] (\\"The Curiously Irresistible Literary Debut of Mark Haddon\\" by Dave Weich), the author, Mark Haddon, admitted that he had definitely written this book as his first novel intended for adults (he was before this solely an author of children's books). He was surprised, he said, when he gave the manuscript to his agent and she said, \\"Let's try it with both adult and children's publishers and see what happens.\\"     What happened is ringing cash registers in suburban America as teachers assign this novel to our children. Next time, Mr. Haddon, please stand firm with your better instincts. Your adult writing can stand successfully on its own with adults where it belongs.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is anything but conventional. If your looking for a plot here, you're in the wrong movie theatre. Instead just imagine if someone was able to film an entire two hour dream sequence and bring it back intact and you can buy it. Would you? And if not, why not? And when am I going to stop asking you questions? I....Don't...Know.<br /><br />This movie has some great heady dialogue, and I would think that it could turn some people off right away. If you mind is shallow as a kiddie pool and you don't know how to swim, it would be best to stay away from these waters. If you enjoyed \\"What The Bleep Do We Know\\", this movie gives another slant on that.
B00005JNJV|4.0|while the movie turned out to be nicely done, it seemed to lack in a few areas. i found myself laughing at the movie during serious seens. one reason because of christain bale pouting his lips when he was batman and the ridiculous lines 'rattle the cages'. some holes in the story also stood out
0060872675|5.0|This childrens book by Terry Pratchett is delightfull for both chilren and adults.  If you have ever been a parent that had to read to their children the same book about a million times in a row only to have the little darlings ask for it again, then this book is for you.  \\"Where's my cow?\\" is the perfect companion to \\"Thud\\".  Adults will enjoy the book because it is slightly subversive and if you have read \\"Thud\\" then you will want to scream with laughter because you are in on the joke.  Small children will love it because like every good children's book, it is full of color and great sounds to make.  The little darlings will want you to read this book to them the next million time in a row.  Could be worse ways to spend quality time with you kids.  Highly Recommended.
B000002A3T|5.0|I have had this CD for years (I believe I bought it when it the first week when it came out in 1994)and never really listened to it. I call it one of those hidden treasure, you know one of those CD's you bought but never really listned to it, then many years later you decide to give it a listen and kick yourself for not listening to it more years ago. I am really happy with \\"The Divison Bell\\" which is a nice follow up to the mildly dissapointing \\"Mometary Lapse of Reason\\" Sure Lapse of Reason had some good cuts, but it was way to 1980's sounding with eletric drums and keyboards. This album really reminds me of Dark Side of the Moon. even though its not as depressing or dark, the back-up vocals (done by some very talented women) are wonderful, as so is the overall feel to the album..just like darkside.... I am amazed that I never really got into this one yrs ago, because it is a real treat. I really recommend this one to Floyd fans, and if you not, this might be a good album to start with as its not to over the top and you can get an overall feel for the band, then move on to the more trippy, spaced out CD's from the 60's and early 70's. Once again a real treat for any music fan.
B000B5IPLK|2.0|I'm surprised that MTV has \\"revived\\" Unplugged performances because 90% of the artists today can't perform  live anyway. I had a difficulty time listening to this CD because 1) Alicia is in dire need of vocal training  and 2) it was boring. Let me tell you about Alicia's singing style. She either shouts, talks, or whispers her way through a song. That is NOT range. And to top it off, Alica's voice sounds raspy and strained. Then there's that stupid song \\"Unbreakable.\\"  The actual title of that song should be called \\"Unoriginal\\" because that's exactly what it is. She sampled from Eddie Kendrick's \\"Intimate Friends\\" and threw in her own lame lyrics.  Yeah, like, that song is really deep! I can't see anyone in the future sampling and covering an Alicia Keys' song. She has no original style of her own. If anyone does cover a song by her, I'm sure it'll be \\"If I Ain't Got You.\\" I've heard contestants on American Idol sing that song waaaaayyy much better than Alicia. Anyway, this CD is tired. Don't waste your money.
B00007LTIC|5.0|I am not going to write a long review for this album, but this is one of my favorite Yes albums and if you are into the band, you have to have this one in your collection! Track # 5, Awaken, not only remains my favorite Yes song, but might be my favorite song of all time. Check this one out as \\"Awaken\\" is worth the price of admission alone
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made!  I can't believe the lousy quality of the DVD, they put out from 1997.  Eight years later they decide to put out a good copy of this movie.  Between watching the DVD, and seeing it on cable so much, the thrill is gone.  With all the money and awards this movie received, they should've put out a good quality DVD in the first place.  Everyone who owns this movie on DVD, should be allowed to trade their crappy (NON-ANAMORPHIC) 97 version, for the new one (FREE)!  That would be the right thing to do!
0525948023|5.0|There is a lot in this book that portrays the human condition to be one that needs to gain a deeper perspective and insight into the catalyst for inner change within the mind in order for outer change to be evident. An engaging read that is distinguishable as one that lights a path for transformation. A most worthwhile book to disengage from the egoic drama and into a more awakened state.
1577314808|5.0|This was the first book I read from Eckhart Tolle, and it's a darn good one! There's a lot covered that I learned about which led to many new realizations about ego, and how to overcome it. Being in the 'now' is a powerful place. I know i'll re-read this book again, and highly recommend it!
B00005JNY4|5.0|GREAT acting GREAT story GRATE looking people.       thats right Great LOOKING PEOPLE but the movie is'nt all bathing sutes & bikinis,it also has a good story too. Jessica Alba (Sin City,The fantastic four)plays Sam a nice inicent HOT girel & Paul Walker (The fast & the ferios,Joy Ride) plays Jarid,the two of them play a hot capole just getting by in the bahamas.Jerid's brouther,a loyer & his girlfrend come on vacaation & they find a sunken plane full of illegal drugs near there clamed shipreck the Zephr       This movie was flat out asome with everething you'd want in a movie action, suspence, JE$$ICA ALBA & I hiley recomend it!!!
0525948023|5.0|I really liked this book and came here to write my review when i noticed the attack reviews. What's up with the reviewer below attacking and making fun of others?  <br />This is the epitome of what Tolle is NOT teaching. It's about removing the obstacles of EGO to bring greater peace on the planet. And what's up with reviewers attacking Tolle's character? It's a book, and a darn good one too. This is not the forum for airing personal attacks, it's a forum for worthwhile BOOK reviews - not personality reviews.  <br /> <br />Aside from the reviews, I enjoyed reading this book, and learned a lot. I only read `The Power of Now' not the other ones, but this book is a great follow up. Highly recommended! <br />
B000062YB1|3.0|\\"Seasons in the Abyss,\\" is definitely a whiplash on you back, \\"War Ensemble\\" cracks your skull with speed rifts and war lyrics.  The dark lyrics of this album are tantamount to aggressive butt kickin you'll definitely enjoy!If you are a Slayer fan you would definitely enjoy this album.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|It's a pretty good documentary....Kind of droll, though.  I just didn't find it very involving, somehow....kind of distant.
B0000634EV|5.0|Down II is by far the best mix of blues and metal I have ever heard.  The rifts alone are a kick ass mix of Southern blues and metal that make you wanna get in a mosh pit.....Anselmo is awesome in Down, more so than Pantera!  \\"Beautifully Depressed,\\" \\"Ghosts of Mississippi\\" show the true range of Anselmo's voice, and how blues and metal can truely mesh to make a kick ass album that screams, \\"BUY ME!\\"
B000AMF7BK|5.0|I give this album 5 stars, triple platinum, a sweep at the Grammys, a 30 minute time slot on late night television, a 2.5 hour uninterupted network concert broadcast and a key to the world. <br /> <br />The calming, self-titled intro \\"Takk\\" leads into what is arguably the best composition Sigur Ros has ever produced thus far in \\"Glosoli\\".  The first time I heard it I played it like 30 times in a row as I couldn't get enough of Jonnsi's falsetto and bowed guitar.  I saw Sigur Ros open with this song in Philly in September 05 and it was very powerful. <br /> <br />Every song on this album is fantastic and it has a very good pace in that (unlike U2's last two albums)you're not slammed with 5 slow songs in a row.  The strings that conclude \\"Soeglapur\\" flows nicely into the crisp piano that leads into \\"Milano.\\"  \\"Gong\\" picks up the pace a bit and places itself in perfect sequence followed by the masterpeice that is \\"Anvardi.\\"  An absolutely stellar performance on this track.  \\"Heysatan\\" concludes this work as if Sigur Ros are saying \\"Takk\\" for the very last time. <br /> <br />Without a doubt the best album Alternative music has seen since Radiohead's OK Komputer.  This CD will be a classic album palettable for generations. <br /> <br />More about the concert - I had been salivating to see these guys live for the last three years.  I can honestly say that this was a concert like none other that I've seen before.  My wife began crying at points in the show because the music was so beautiful.  At the conclusion of the show, Sigur Ros took two curtain calls in the midst of a 7 minute standing ovation.  I couldn't keep a dry eye during the ovation as I felt such strong gratitude in witnessing Sigur Ros' playing their hearts out in what was a powerful and emotional performance.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I'm not going to bother telling you the storyline of the film as Amazon tells it, I dont know why people bother...<br /><br />That guy that said Friday the 13th was better is talking jack obviously! Your talking about cheese? cheese? Oh my god cheese, Friday the 13th has more cheese than a cheese factory!<br /><br />This film is the greatest horror of all time and possibly the all time greatest film.<br /><br />Lets get this straight this was a low budget film, the film cost just over $50,000, yes thats $50,000. It doesnt shock you too much as there wasnt much blockbusting scences so to speak.<br /><br />The camera work in this film is superb. Tick's all boxes. The lighting is also very good and sets the mood of the film.<br /><br />Michael myers ( The Shape ) played by Nick Castle was top class. The guy was genius, he had the perfect walk, composure and attitude to play The Shape. Myers will always be the greatest ever Slashing Maniac. Myers is now around 50 years old and they cant turn his age back so, the child Jamie had, which we found outi n halloween : the curse of michael myers may be the maiac slashing son, you never know.<br /><br />The \\" scare \\" factor in this film is quite high but not as high as other halloween films that have came in h4 h5 h6 perhaps.<br /><br />This film doesn't need any gore as it doesnt have much because as the story unfolds it gripp's you.<br /><br />Friday the 13th vs Halloween? no A nightmare on Elm Street<br /><br />Halloween beats a nightmare convincingly in my book but a nightmare is alot lot better than friday the 13th, its more fun.<br /><br />Michael vs Jason<br /><br />I mean Michael has the composure and charisma !<br /><br />Jason is just a tall powerhouse he doesnt have the weapons like michael.<br /><br />Thanks for viewing my review, hope it helps out!
0156027321|4.0|The good parts of this book were based on plot and descriptions. Pi's creativity and strong will keeps the reader entranced and often surprised. Even in Part I, when the novel seems to be random tidbits about Pi's life, the little descriptions and short stories are creative and often humorous. However, I had thought that this book would, as it said, make me \\"believe in God.\\" Because I thought I was going to discover insight on God, I was disappointed. The majority of the book does not focus on religion or God at all. Even though Pi lives and that probably required God's help, a story like that should not be called one that makes you \\"believe in God.\\" If you do not expect to gain truths about God and wish to fall into a captivating story of a young boys fantastic survival, Li of Pi can fulfill, but it can not fulfill its promise of making \\"you believe in God.\\" I rated it a four because of this disappointment in its lack of fulfillment in its promise and for a lack of definite conclusion. I did find the twist at the end with the other version of Pi's story to be fascinating. I had accepted pretty much everything he had told us up until that point, and I thought it was great that Pi could have been making up/ imagining the animals and other things. To me that seems to be a great coping mechanism for young Pi that helped him deal with the problems he faced. I do however wish that the author would not have left the book hanging with the reader wondering whether or not Pi's story with the animals was the one that really happened or the one with the humans. If the animal version was true, this would not necessarily make me \\"believe in God;\\" it would make me believe in the power of imagination.
B000002UAU|1.0|I just bought this CD and I dont' see what all the hype is about.  My teacher always talks about the Beatles but they have no lyrical skills, my cousin Rodney is a better song writer than these clowns.  I think they should remix these songs with 50 Cent or Snoop, then they'd really get some fans behind them.

B000000H3W|5.0|I first got into Sepultura when a friend lent me \\"Chaos A.D.\\" It was pretty good, but my estimation was that the band wasn't in the same league as Metallica, Testament, etc. One day, Amazon recommended \\"Arise\\", and I figured, \\"Why not buy it? It can't be bad.\\"    To use a cliched phrase: it blew me away. The band brings an energy to \\"Arise\\" that was lacking in \\"Chaos A.D.\\", and it's that energy that elevates this album to the level of metal masterpiece. All four members kick some serious ass on this album - Max Cavalera's voice is at its best here, and damn, can he play a guitar. Lead guitarist Andreas Kisser flawlessly executes solo after jaw-dropping solo. Bassist Paulo Jr. gallops along, easily keeping pace with both guitarists. And drummer Igor, Max's brother, tears it up like his American thrash comtemporaries only wish they could.    And it's not just the band, the songs themselves are awesome. Standouts for me include the title track, \\"Dead Embryonic Cells\\", \\"Desperate Cry\\", and \\"Subtraction\\". But each person has their own favorites, mostly because every single track is awesome. There is truly no filler here. The bonus tracks also rule, especially their cover of Motorhead's \\"Orgasmatron\\".    To sum it all up, I guarantee that if you love thrash metal, you will love this album. If you haven't heard of the band, or if you're staying away because you've only heard their modern material and want to see what they sounded like before the change in vocalists, then start right here. And take it from me, you WILL be headbanging to this album years after you bought it. It's just that good.
6305428387|5.0|This is a classic...The performances are all well done, by John Candy and the others as well.  It tells of the Jamacian bobsled team and their quest to get to the Olympics.  It shows their struggles and teamwork they use to overcome them, and provides plenty of laughs along the way.  It is awesome.  I recommend it to anyone who likes movies.
B0007OE15O|4.0|FYI: This is cover for Rosenrot 2005 album. 4 stars based on \\"Benzin\\" video.
B000B0WODA|5.0|When I First got this, I ran to my cd player and popped this right in. I was exited as I heared the strong opener, \\"The Fallen\\" (my favorite song on the album). That exitement stayed all the way through \\"Do You Want To\\", but diminished a little. My excitement faded to the end of the album. I was shocked. I put the old Franz in, beleiving this to be a sophomore slump. However, there, too was something missing with the old Franz. I started to listen to the new album, and the more I listened to it, the more I came to realize, it was excellent in a weird sort of way. <br /> <br />     \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" is not a second album, it is a new album. Each Franz is a unique experience on it's own, not in comparison to each other. Say what you must, but don't give up hope on Franz, and you too can see the good in it.
0345446798|5.0|Wonderful insight and an easy read.  I couldn't put it down and was amazed at how her techniques worked on my puppy.  It is more of an all around book i.e. the whys of dog behavior rather than just how to training-although I still did get a notebook full of pointers to use.
B00003CX8U|4.0|I resided in New York from the 70's until the late 80's,and had a number of friends who worked on Broadway consequently, I spent a lot of time in the area and I would spot Mr. Fosse here and there on the Great White Way,  always cloaked in black,  with that omnipresent ciggy dangling from his lips (seldom held, just jutted it out from his lower lip). I met him once in 74' and he was charming and edgy, just like, \\"All That Jazz\\". The dance sequences are, as you would expect from a world class choreographer-spectacular. This is a film with music about a man who is chasing his demons down as Mr Fosse obviously did. Great fun to watch and Roy Schieder and Anne Reiking are terrific in it and the opening sequence of the dancers \\"cattle call\\" is remarkable. Sadly, Mr. Fosse did not expel all his demons for he died at a very early age in 1987 (60) in Washington D.C. walking back to his hotel with his wife Gwen Verdon where he was directing a revival of \\"Sweet Charity\\", both he and the show closed out of town. A self destructive life that in the end destroyed him, as he forecasted in \\"All That Jazz\\". A truly great showcase of his outsized abilities.
B00008DDSC|4.0|I found this to be one of the most interesting and unique films that i have seen in a long while. I was entertained right the way through. All of the actors play their parts brilliantly, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal, who really lets herself go as Lee, giving the audience great insight into her character. I felt slightly let down at the end however, as it did not seem to fit with the rest of the film. Still, an excellent movie, would recommend it to anyone who likes something a bit different!
B000000OTU|3.0|AEROSMITH-BIG ONES: Although the Bad Boys from Beantown's first greatest hits package was for from perfect, lacking long time fan faves such as TRAIN KEPT A ROLLIN', BIG TEN INCH and MAMA KIN, it's still a helluva lot more fun than this \\"Second Phase of Aerosmith\\" mix. DREAM ON may have been the definitive power ballad of its era, but BIG ONES is overstuffed with interchangeable metal mellow-dies such as CRYIN', AMAZING, and CRAZY, that have unfortunately become the group's bland schtick-in-trade (their chart topping DON'T WANNA MISS A THING goes missing here). Even slick uptempo fare such as DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY, RAG DOLL and LOVE IN AN ELEVATOR can't hold a Bic lighter to the greasy, funked up hard rockin' seventies groove-a-thons BACK IN THE SADDLE, SAME OLD SONG & DANCE and WALK THIS WAY. BIG ONES will no doubt suffice as a sampler for fans who didn't grow up on the 'SMITH's original hyperkinetic bone-bruisers, but Boston's longest lived band of head-bangers sure doesn't shimmy n' shake the paint off the walls the way it used to.<br /><br />RATING: THREE LIPS
B000002G8H|4.0|This album is an example of one of the reasons Eric Clapton is still popular after all these years. He knows how to please the majority with his consistently pleasant, middle of the road music. Recommended for casual, curious, or hard core Clapton fans (who probably already have a copy). His strong cover of J.J. Cale's 'Cocaine', and his two self-penned songs, the beautiful and earnest 'Wonderful Tonight' and the toe tappin', knee slappin' 'Lay Down Sally' (co-written with bandmates, Marcy Levy and George Terry) are reason enough to purchase the album.
B000005B0U|3.0|BLUES BROTHERS 2000/ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Like the movie itself, BLUES BROTHERS 2000 is a flawed, if spirited musical sequel to the classic 1980 film and soundtrack album. Stacking the deck with welcome RNB guest stars ranging from the old school (Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, B.B. King) to the new (Blues Traveler, Jonny Lang) sounds like a can't-miss idea. Dan \\"Elwood\\" Aykroyd and new Blues Brother John Goodman do their noble best to recapture the old magic, but John Belushi's ribald charisma and raw energy are naturally missed here...perhaps brother Jim should have been drafted for this project? At least the B.B. King-led Louisiana Gator Boys (an all-star turn featuring every cool cat from Bo Diddley and Jimmie Vaughan to Steve Winwood and Gary \\"U.S\\" Bonds) generates enough righteous riffing to pull off HOW BLUE CAN YOU GET. The Paul Butterfield Blues Band oldie BORN IN CHICAGO is uniformly excellent and Dr. John kicks out the jams on Donovan's spooky SEASON OF THE WITCH, but too much of BLUES BROTHERS 2000 falls short of Jake and Elwood's original vision.<br /><br />RATING: THREE PIECES OF DRY TOAST
B000784WMW|5.0|This is by far the greatest film version of this classic book ever!  Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton absolutely smoulder in every sceen they did together.  This one I can watch forever!
B000002J5K|5.0|THE BLUES BROTHERS movie soundtrack is probably even more fun than the legendary John Belushi/Dan Akroyd flick, which had its best moments via high spirited musical interludes and legendary guest stars Cab Calloway, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and Ray Charles.  You get a genre-jumpin' grabbag of jazz (PETER GUNN), rock (GIMME SOME LOVIN' and JAILHOUSE ROCK, wailed out in ragged-but-right Belushi fashion), gospel (James Brown's sweaty testimonial THE OLD LANDMARK), country (THEME FROM RAWHIDE, which suits Akroyd's deadpan vocal ability to a tee), swing (Cab Calloway's signature hit MINNIE THE MOOCHER), and pure, unabashed soul (from the &quot;Queen&quot; and the &quot;Genious&quot; of it, Aretha and Ray). The bluesiest moments on here are a joyous eight minute workout of the ROBERT JOHNSON warhorse SWEET HOME CHICAGO and the infectious EVERYBODY NEEDS SOMEBODY TO LOVE, which may not top Wilson Pickett's soul-shredding version but boasts an enthusiastic spoken word Akroyd intro.  Even apart from the fractured flick, THE BLUES BROTHERS disc works beautifully as the background to a road trip, beer blast, or spontaneous dance party...in short, if you've got the blues, pop this baby in and watch 'em disappear faster than the Bluesmobile itself!<br /><br />RATING: FIVE PACKS OF SMOKES
B000AYEIZY|4.0|....and probably a bit picky because of that. I have the CD by the way, and not the DVD, so I can't comment on how old these guys look. They definitely play like old men, which isn't really meant to be mean, but picture three Italian tenors, past their prime, singing O Solo Mio before a house full of people who've dropped several hundred dollars a ticket to see their former gods perform their farewell concert, and you have a reasonable understanding of what I'm finding (so far) wrong with the album. It's possible that things will get better here. I'm only up to Sleepy Time (took that long to get back from the record store!) and I note that Clapton just ran off a  furious little lick that sounded fairly tight, but if you are a Cream fan, come prepared for the following: Clapton still insists on playing the piece-of-crap Stratocaster that sounds great on \\"Lay Down Sally,\\" but which makes him sound like a second-rate bar-gigger when he tries to lay into \\"Spoonful.\\" Instead of the bright, overdriven distortion that makes the live solo on the 1960's Cream LP the second best Clapton moment outside of \\"Have you Heard,\\" we get that muddy, Strat-generated distortion that sounds like it's being produced by a solid-state amp miked into the PA system. Yes, I'm being a little cruel here, and perhaps a little outspoken, but there are plenty of older blues players who managed to generate stunning sound with their set-ups, so Clapton shouldn't be excused casually for failing to recognize that Cream had a unique sound which can't be faked by choosing the wrong gear for performance. Still, as other reviewers have pointed out, this is a much, MUCH better performance than many of Clapton's recent albums, and I give credit to these guys for at least TRYING to get back to their early roots. No one expects Clapton to still play exactly as he did in 1968, but he should at least try to match the sound, even if 40 years have changed the way that he wants to approach the structure of the songs.
B000B0WODA|1.0|Seriously, am I the only one not blinded by the hype? Am I the only one who actually hears this album? This albums is a perfect example of why we even have terms like \\"Sophomore Slump\\" and \\"Sellout.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Do You Want To\\" is the cheesiest song of the year with horrible lyrics and an irritating riff. Why anyone would listen to this more than once is beyond me. The title track is so horribly horrible and boring that I'm not even going to try and come up with something clever. It just sucks. <br /> <br />The rest of the album isn't much different. They seem to have been reading the titles of too many Ramones songs. Their favourite word is \\"wanna\\" and they don't use it as well as Joey Ramone.  <br /> <br />I love their debut. Maybe the best album from last year. This album can't be their debut's toilet paper. If someone tells you this is a really great follow-up, don't listen to them. I wasted 20 bucks on this, don't make the same mistake.

B000002AP1|5.0|After seeing the Doors in concert, James Osterberg A.K.A. Iggy Stooge (before he became Iggy Pop) was mesmerized by Jim Morrison and started his own band, the Stooges, which inspired alot of punk bands. The Stooges were a truly groundbreaking band and the godfathers of punk. They were fronted by Iggy Pop, a legend of punk and one of the greatest frontmen around. With albums like \\"The Stooges\\", \\"Fun House\\", and \\"Raw Power\\", Iggy and the Stooges helped define the punk rock genre.<br /><br />This album is a CLASSIC, and Iggy Pop's remix is great. As others have said, he cranked the volume knobs to max when remastering this album in 1996, therefore, everything literally went from RAW to ROAR. In my opinion, \\"Search and Destroy\\", \\"Penetration\\", \\"I Need Somebody\\" (sounds better than ever before!), and \\"Shake Appeal\\" benefit the most from his remix. The muddy sound is gone from the songs in this remix, and I, for one, am glad about that. I definitely hope whoever listens to Iggy's remix version of this album via headphones checks the volume level first. Raw Power is a classic! Buy it, download it, whatever you have to do to hear it.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B00005MP58|5.0|I believe that this is the best dramatization of Austen's most beloved novel brought to the screen.  It should be revised in high definition!  On a dreary day, this DVD set can brighten your day.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Ripping off greater artists (and in this case, some lesser ones), \\"Under My Skin\\" is perfect for the \\"rebellious, angsty\\" teenager in your life who isn't discerning enough to know good music, yet too picky to buy non-pretentious pop. Just about every element in this CD is stolen - the Alanis vocalisms, the 'powerful' (s$@*$#^) Nickelback chord progressions, the lame introspectiveness of \\"How Does It Feel\\" and lyrics which could only have been stolen from a write-your-own lyrics thread on a Linkin Park fan forum. It sells itself as a work of insightful genius, but has the depth of the mould on my bathroom mat. This is music made by someone who doesn't give a sh*t about music, audience or even basic dignity.<br /><br />Her lyrics are vapid and possibly she got better on her newest album. But her \\"guitar skills?\\" Please. Look closely at her Complicated video. The only real chord she played was a G. Look at the tabs now. You there? Good. There is no G chord anywhere in the song. Guitars are meant to be played, they are not for decoration. She lied about her songwriting in her first album, why wouldn't she on this one? Listen to her live to see what REAL talent she has. Don't buy this CD.<br /><br />Here's how I sum up Avril: She claims to be into rock, yet can not pronounce and probably has never heard of David Bowie (one of the greatest musicians EVER). She originally wanted to be a country singer. Says she hates pop music, yet sings it. All her songs are the same, it's the old \\"I had a boyfriend but he dumped me because I'm ugly, boo hoo\\", roughly translated as \\"A six year old could write better music than me! Buy my CD to inflate my ego and lower your IQ further!\\" Only teenagers addicted to MTV who lack the determination and talent to do well at school and think they're marginalised because of this will find it at all acceptable.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B00020HEG6|5.0|I bought this CD just for Buckbeak's Flight. I will play it over and over. It is truly beautiful!!! I also found A Window to the Past is also gorgeous!!!  <br />The woodwind runs are always fun to hear...and so impressive (well for me as I cannot play such).  <br />This soundtrack is fun and more interesting than the last ones. Double Trouble is very interesting...a Harry Potter song with words.  <br />This CD has much more attitude than the past and is much more interesting and a bit darker, but not too dark.
B0000041Z5|5.0|This Brahms Symphonies set with Sir Georg Solti/Chicago Symphony is one of Solti's better recordings in Chicago.  Recorded in 1979, just before the Digital age and technology took over, these are beautiful, smooth and creamy recordings with rich bass and nice mid range.  Solti is intense but never driven, and he knows just how much intensity to put into Brahms without over-driving him and making the music become melodramatic or vulgar.  The sound London's engineers got in these recordings is better than for the Solti/Chicago Beethoven Symphonies recorded earlier that decade, 1972-74.   <br /> <br />The Chicago Symphony under Solti was \\"HOT\\" in recording sales during the 1970s.  I was in college from 1977-81, and all the brass and woodwind players raved about Chicago's recordings of Strauss, Mahler, and other composers which were currently being released.  I especially recall a flute player who was estatic because she received three Solti/Chicago LPs for Christmas gifts one year.  The brass and woodwinds are often emphasized in many Solti/Chicago recordings, with the strings less prominent than some orchestras;  but here the balance is very equal where needed, and the brass do yeoman service in the passages most needed, such as the running figures at the end of Symphony 2:IV.   <br /> <br />Solti does take alot of repeats, especially in Symphony 2:I, which makes this movement several minutes longer than most recordings.  And he isn't afraid to take his time - tempos aren't too fast, and never feel driven:  not always the case in a Solti recording.  I of Symphony 1 and Symphony 3 also have repeats, thus making these movements longer than in recordings of Bruno Walter or George Szell. <br /> <br />The companion works, Academic Festival Overture and Tragic Overture are also excellent in every way, recalling Bruno Walter/Columbia Symphony (Sony), who recorded these works in stereo 20 years before Solti/Chicago.
B000AXSN5G|3.0|\\"See the bluebird fly back as in a dream, dippin' & bobbin' in the sun,\\" opens \\"No Wonder,\\" my favorite track on \\"Prairie Wind.\\"  It has Neil's thundering guitar giving the song energy and his most determined vocal on the set.  When Neil Young covered \\"Imagine\\" on the \\"America: A Tribute to Heroes\\" CD that was in response to the 9/11 tragedy, it was a stately reading that I believe would have made John Lennon smile.  On \\"When God Made Me,\\" Neil attempts his own anthem and works fairly well with a powerful sentiment.  The title track and \\"He Was the King,\\" an Elvis tribute, both are strong songs.  The only track that makes me hit the skip button is \\"Falling Off the Face of the Earth.\\"  I also really like the artwork and packaging on the booklet.  While this is not Young's strongest set, it is a fairly interesting set for those who like \\"Harvest\\" & \\"Comes A Time.\\"  Enjoy!
B0009S2T0M|2.0|The whole movie centralizes one theme: Revenge. Dae-su is imprisoned for 15 years not knowing why, and subjected to gas and mind control. Then released. You will understand why he was imprisoned in the end.  <br /> <br />It's a two hour movie, but I found myself bored with the majority of it. Sometimes fragmented going from one scene to another with no apparent order, but it all comes together in the end. I gave this a two stars because the movie could have been done in ONE hour.  <br /> <br />It also has a very very long sex scene which grossed me out. I really did not want to watch so much sex (something reminding me of porno), and it was entirely too long. You understand why the sex scene was shown in the end, but I thought it was WAY too long. The message could have been put across with just 1/4th the amount of sex scene. I considered it a \\"filler\\" to use up time. made the movie even more boring.  <br /> <br />I felt like during the watching of this movie..waiting..waiting..waiting for something to happen. I was mostly bored. <br /> <br />The last 20 minutes is exceptional. Everything comes together. But I was thinking why do I have to sit through 1-1/2 hours which only led up to this point? In short a lot of the movie dragged and dragged and only 20 minutes of it was really good.  <br /> <br />It earned five stars among critics, but I honestly wondered how. Just the last 20 minutes...but I felt bored watching this before this point. If you can get this movie rented, by all means get it. And I would say it is probably worth under nine dollars if you have to buy it, but no more than that. <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I am more of a classic rock fan if anything, so I usually dispise metal, and I put it into the catagory of screaming into a microphone, but System of a Down is different. They mix loud melodic screaming with soft and beautiful sounding breaks in between. Each song is different in it's own way, which sets it apart from most metal. I admit must rock fans won't like, but if you are willing to give different genres a try, I say this is worth listening to if anything.

0425166805|1.0|I had seen the \\"Psudo-documentary\\" movie based upon this book back in the early 70's as an impressionable teenager. After having been introduced to the \\"theories,\\" I was a firm believer that, yes, we had been visited before.<br /><br />Over the years, the cracks began to appear as much of Von Daniken's \\"evidence\\" was shown to be either fraudulent or, totally misrepresented. It did not take long for me to realize that the only thing Von Doniken was interested in was making money for himself by selling this tripe.<br /><br />I soon discovered such wonderful publications as \\"Skeptical Inquirer\\" and \\"Skeptic\\" magazine. My conversion was complete! I can say, that Von Daniken was a valuable learning experience for a young teenager in the 70's.<br /><br />I think the true first words in this book, at the top of the very first page, are the most telling:<br /><br />This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, business establishments, or locales is entirely coincidental
B00001PE4D|5.0|This movie gives a sexy, sensual twist to the sterotypical \\"teen flick.\\" It communicates a new idea of sexuality amongst present-day teenagers, rather than the \\"bang her and leave her\\" mentality that is most commonly portrayed. I think the cast was very well chosen, and the dynamics of the cast were amazing. There weren't too many \\"no means\\" or \\"B list\\" actors, but on the other hand there weren't too many \\"A listers,\\" which would have thrown the focus off the plot. The music used in the movie was perfect because it accentuated the tone of the movie.
B000AQBA1W|4.0|After the disappointment of last year's Borrowed Heaven and the obvious pressure the band was under from Atlantic to score big in the States with urban synth rhythms and country flavors, it's wonderful to hear the band do something they are not only very familiar with, but to put a nice poppy sheen on.  In fact, I have waited for the Corrs to do an album like this for 6 years, and the wait has paid off handsomely if not exactly as I'd hoped.  Being a huge fan of Irish music and culture, I felt this album was just a bit too poppy, thus the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />Some of this tribute to their late mother Jean works and some of it doesn't.  For instance, their contemporary arrangement doesn't do anything for the old world poetry of \\"Black is the Color.\\"  Imagine contemporary keyboards and strings against these lyrics:<br /><br />I go to the Clyde and I mourn and weep<br /><br />For satisfied I never sleep<br /><br />I write him letters, just a few short lines<br /><br />And I suffer death 10,000 times<br /><br />Then again, the same sort of arrangement works for beautiful \\"Moorlough Shore.\\"  Why, I don't know, because the lyrics are just as old world and romantic, if not even more!<br /><br />If you're a fan of Clannad's, as I am, forget the Corrs' interpretation of \\"Bauchaille on Eirne,\\" because you will find the rendition too fast paced and Andrea's gaelic enunciation far from the graceful treatment of Maire Brennan's.  I will say, however, that I love Andrea's clear enunciation, because I'm studying gaelic, and it's very hard to grasp!<br /><br />Enough of the comparisons, as I'm here to accentuate the POSITIVE!  Without apology the two instrumentals, \\"Old Hag\\" and \\"Haste to the Wedding\\" are simply more of the delightful instrumentals we have already loved the Corrs for since 1995!  Gorgeous studio version of Thin Lizzy's \\"Old Town\\" cannot be missed as it's bouncier and more beautiful than the version you may be used to from the Unplugged cd.<br /><br />\\"Spancill Hill\\" is definitely among my top three favorites here because it's contemporary, yet maintains a traditional sound--especially near the end with Andrea's tin whistle, Sharon's violin, and Caroline's bodhran.  \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" is so beautiful, a song about a man's longing for his woman who's married another.  Not an unusual topic for traditional Irish songs, but one of the most stunning.  Absolutely the best?  Look no further than Anna McGarrigle's \\"Heart Like a Wheel.\\"  Where Linda Ronstadt poured too much vocal emotion into her phrasing 30 years ago, Andrea does it sensitive and gentle service.  The lyrics are already so painfully and emotionally charged, that a tortured vocal isn't the key to this track.  It's Andrea's sweet, soft delivery on top of that beautiful piano accompaniment.<br /><br />In summation, don't judge this album based on their last one, because you'll be missing lots of good music this time.  It's still a little more contemporary than you may like, but if you love the original version of Talk on Corners and the spirit of their debut album, Forgiven Not Forgotten, I think you will appreciate Home.br />\\"Spancill Hill\\" is definitely among my top three favorites here because it's contemporary, yet maintains a traditional sound--especially near the end with Andrea's tin whistle, Sharon's violin, and Caroline's bodhran.  \\"Brid Og Ni Mhaille\\" is so beautiful, a song about a man's longing for his woman who's married another.

0525948023|4.0|So please, chill. I truly enjoyed this follow up to \\"The Power of Now\\". I read it in one night I liked it so much! But I am a mature, open-minded person. So what is the matter with you die-hard Eckhart fans? \\"Barbara-Rose\\"--you know --the one with the advertised website and PhD written next to her name couldn't be more indicative of someone who's on the \\"New Age\\" bandwagon. So, \\"spiritual\\" girlfriend needs to chill, too. <br /> <br />Yes, he's brilliant. No one  here is saying he is not a good communicator--and that goes for the individuals who are simply saying: his CHARACTER IS IN QUESTION! That is an important thing. No matter the brilliant talks. I heard him do a most fascinating talk in Canada that went on for four hours and it was the most brilliant thing I had ever heard. No one is discrediting his work as a spiritual messenger--but just get it, please, that there's another side to his character. According to people who have had real experienced with this man. (they don't trash his work!). It seems shocking, but many people are like this. Usually men who want to \\"rule\\" in what they do and it looks like Tolle is not giving up the scepter any time soon.(I realize I `m now going to be labeled a blasphemer by alluding to the idea that he may be \\"ego\\" tistical-?) But I say, yeah, he's probably a conceited jerk, even though he's as cute as a chipmunk. For shame!   <br /> <br />These other \\"reviewers\\" are not \\"clowns\\" nor do they sound stupid. What they've said is worth considering. In fact, I'd love to hear more. <br />
B000007ODY|5.0|Karajan is largely considered the greatest exponent for mainstream symphonic works- Mozart, Brahms, Tchaikovsky Mahler, Dvorak and Bruckner. This collection is a terrific buy and it's affordable. You can't go wrong. Recorded in 1977 and 1978, Karajan delivers all the rich melody, grace, grandeur and musical harmony that Brahms suffused his four symphonies with. The Berlin Philharmonic are trained so that even the strings move with miraculous exactitude. The only other worthy set is Solti's. This one has everything one can hope for in Brahms symphonies. <br /> <br />Karajan was always a champion of his own German music's history. He is still regarded as the first-rate exponent of Wagner and Strauss for example. Brahms, born in Austria, was another composer whose Germanic music Karajan was able to aptly depict through the magic of his baton. The impressive parts of this set include the entire 1st symphony- not reduced to the Beethoven parody some make it out to be. Instead, it holds its own as a work of compelling power. The finale is inspirational. The finale to the second is equally as moving. The 4th symphony is my favorite symphony of the post Beethoven Romantic Era. In this symphony we find a mixture of mysticism, romantic beauty and classical balance. In it we also find, in the last movement, the greatest example of theme and variations, Brahm's strongest suit as a composer. Karajan knows his stuff. You can never go wrong with any of his interpretations, though he, too, has his detractors. His Tchaikovsky tends to be too fiery and melodramatic for example and he was never at home with Italian opera as he was in German. Karajan is brilliant and his Berlin forces electrify. At a cheap price, this is a must have if you call yourself a true classical music fan.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|If you like films filled with humor, eccentric characters and cross-cultural connections in unexpected places, this is a film for you.  Jasmin (Marianne Sagebrecht) is a Bavarian tourist, who, upon growing tired of her husband, promptly abandons him, unfortunately taking his suitcase of clothes, with her, instead of her own.  She arrives in the Mojave Desert, only to encounter the Bagdad Cafe, run by Brenda (C.C.H Pounder), who has also recently separated from her husband---or, rather, she has kicked him to the curb.  This chance encounter, between two women who have lost their husbands and the identities they possessed up until that point, is life changing for both.  Though, the beginning of their relationship is rather rocky, their feathers smooth as trust is mutually earned and kept.<br /><br />Bagdad Cafe presents us with a cross-section of quirky, eccentric characters, whose world is put in a slight tilt, upon the arrival of the Bavarian lady.  This is something they all need, and is made more evident as the film progresses.  If you are looking to be moved in an unexpected way, I really reccomend this film.  It is a little treasure......
B00005JO0J|1.0|Notice how highly rated this movie is across the internet? This <br />is because of the over-zealous fans of this garbage who vote perfect scores again and again in at desperate attempt to keep <br />this franchise afloat since its bombed bigtime at the box office. <br />
B000005J56|5.0|It was the music of the Buena Vista Social Club, brought to the U.S.A. by Ry Cooder, that brought the sound of cha cha, bolero and son to the foreground.  These songs are, first and foremost, some of the most authentically beautiful, sensual musical forms in the existence of Cuban music.  I remember watching the artists, featured in the soundtrack, on the big screen.  All I could keep thinking was, \\"How could these artists be 'forgotten'?  Their music is so amazing!\\"  Artists like Omara Portunda (the beautiful, sensuous lone female vocalist featured with Ibrahim Ferrer on \\"20 A&ntilde;os,\\" a haunting bolero) and Ibrahim Ferrer, well into their seventies, eighties, and, even nineties, still singing and playing their instruments with wild abandon!  What an inspiration.<br /><br />I guarantee that this album has something for everyone.  We have the popular \\"Chan Chan,\\" a slower tune, played with guitar and percussion, \\"El Cuarto de Tula\\" (a wild number, great for salsa dancing to!) and many other cuts.  This is a true example of the triumph of the human spirit, how nobody can overcome it, and how it transcends ages and cultures.

0061020710|5.0|I really love all of Terry Pratchett's books, but this one is probably my favorite.  The main character Rincewind (aka wizzard with no magical abilities and an ever presesnt sense of danger)  must guide the tourist Twoflower, who continually assures him that because he's a tourist nothing bad could ever happen to him.  For example, he want's to stop and take a picture of the cuddly dragon with razor sharp claws, and Rincewind insits very strongly (emphasized with running) that they leave.  Sometimes he does have a point.  Anyways, not only are the charcters amusing, but the sattire is perfect.  It's not slapstick humor, the characters create the humor.  I hate reading books where all the humor is forced and just doesn't fit,  but all the nonsense allways makes me think, \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\"...  Don't listen to what other people say about the chapters not flowing, and they don't seem like one story or all that,  it's all nonsense.  If you are actually reading the story and not just looking at the pretty pictures you'll see that everything fits.  Terry Pratchett's books are brilliant.  He deserves a nice little badge that says \\"BEST AUTHOR EVER!\\" and maybe a nice little orangutang as well.  Color of Magic is an excellent start to Terry Pratchett's colorful world.

B000002G7E|5.0|I learned \\"Sister Ray\\" from a blues band in Mount Vernon, Ohio in 1969. From a professional musician's point of view, this recording is a total disaster. But the last thing on Lou Reed's mind was professional musicianship. So we treat these recorded performances the same way we treat the Bible: A hardcore few say this is the unmitigated truth; most of the rest say this is material ripe for interpretation. And Reed proved this himself on the much-maligned \\"Rock and Roll Animal.\\"  <br /> <br />All this by way of saying that Lou Reed and company had musical ambitions that far exceeded their actual abilities. This is not a complaint, it is a compliment. One of these days, this album will be revered as much as the recordings of Robert Johnson.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This is a visually stunning and thoroughly enjoyable film.I don't think it will appeal to everyone.However,if you try not to be put off by the look of the thing - the story and action are interesting enough on their own.To be honest,the style of the film only serves to enhance it's watchability and afterwards you are left with the sense that-if it wasn't so stylized you would probably feel that something was missing.
B00005JO0J|5.0|First off, I want to warn everyone that I am not going to reveal any of the specific happenings of the movie in this review, because someone will shoot me in my sleep for spoiling it.<br /><br />Although my sister watches many of Whedon's television series, I myself do not. Unfortunately, she is not a big sci-fi outer-space type person, otherwise I would have been an avid `Firefly' fan a lot sooner. I discovered the show on DVD well after it had been canceled, when I was pre-ordering the prematurely canceled `Wonderfalls' series on Amazon. Many of the people who rated Wonderfalls mentioned how FOX had canned their 2 best shows before giving them a fair chance, and named Firefly as the other of FOX's major  bubble follies. This intrigued me, so I read a lot of the Amazon reviews for `Firefly'. After seeing that even though quite a few people gave it 0-1 stars, it still came out on top of 550+ reviews with an astounding 5 stars, so I ordered it as well. I was not disappointed in the least. It started out a bit slow over the first couple of episodes, but what show doesn't while trying to introduce all of their characters and get the plot going without totally confusing the viewers? After the first few episodes, I was totally hooked. The special effects of the series, as well as the movie, might not be up to par with Star Wars, but that combined with the perfect cast members, are what make it all the more realistic and believable. I truly can not decide if I like the show or the movie better, but that's a good thing, isn't it? In my opinion, they are both most excellent.<br /><br />When I first saw the `Serenity' trailer, it appeared that Whedon had remade a lot of the previous tv series so that it was big screen worthy and easier for the audience who had never seen the show to follow, but boy was I wrong. He actually just gave supplemental information from what had already been revealed on the show, which in effect answered all the previously posed questions. Instead of that creating a true ending, I am hoping tying up all of the loose ends gives Joss more flexibility for incorporating new ideas into possible upcoming Serenity flicks. And may there be many more to come.ad of that creating a true ending, I am hoping tying up all of the loose ends gives Joss more flexibility for incorporating new ideas into possible upcoming Serenity flicks.

B000065U1N|5.0|As many of us may know, Black Hawk Down is a movie that pertains to an event that not too many of us know. Taking place in Somalia in 1993, the events that occured at that time was one of the worst: 300,000 deaths from starvation. <br />   The movie begins with the scenes of starving people slowly withering away like a shriveled plant. The facts are clearly stated in words and the sad part of it all is that every word holds true. <br />   The movie revolves around the action taken by the marines to find and arrest the warlord, Mohammed Farah Adid, who was responsible for the deaths of 300,000 people. As it was stated, \\"years of warfare among rival clans cause famine on a biblical scale.\\" <br />   The movie isn't focused around a specific person but rather a group of young marines sent into one of the most hostile places in the world. The resistance they faced and the events that followed brought them into a battle for their lives. The brotherhood that exists between the marines is undeniably the strongest and most courageous I've ever seen. It clearly shows that it's all about the \\"man next to you\\". Personally, I felt that these men gave their lives and risked countless more all to serve their country and to help those in need on the other side of the world and it'd be blasphemous not to be proud of our men serving in the military and overseas. <br />   The movie also gave a sense that many of us do not have it that badly. There are countless people who face the same kind of suffering and struggles in their own homeland; let alone, many of our soldiers risk their lives everyday to serve us and others. Black Hawk Down is a movie with meaning and serves as a reminder of what occurs in the world and about what our men are doing to make a difference.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Pat Metheny and his Group never fails to amaze me with  <br />new compositions of sheer brilliance . <br />The sound is undoubtedly Metheny  and just like Miles he will be remembered for his genius and technique . Not forgetting Lyle Mays  magical contributions and Steve Rodby's terrific production . <br />This album laid out like a classical piece of four tracks  three much longer than the first is a joy to behold and easily accessible.
B000AM1TGC|5.0|This remaster has improved the faulty sound of the original CD release. This is very noticible in \\"The Lovers\\" and \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\". The original \\"The Lovers\\" sounded like it was lifted from an old vinyl record that was scratched to hell. Now it is crystal clear with an airy sounding mellotron. The orginal \\"Shadow ...\\" was a little fuzzy but not to bad as the previous track. Actually in whole, the album benefitted from the remastering and anyone from a whole hearted fan (such as myself) to a newbie of Steve Hackett's solo work should get this.  <br />As for the two extra tracks...there not too bad. The live version of \\"Ace of Wands\\" is like the other live versions. So if you so not own a live Hackett album, this would give you a good idea on how he retools some songs for the concert. The extended playout of \\"Shadow ...\\" is all right, the extended part actually is at the massive end of the song. The other 3/4th are much the same as the original.

When Mr. Harris describes how religion is the one thing that hasnt progressed over the years, it really makes you think.  Perhaps if we Americans can go about things in a new and improved way, we may have a chance at saving this planet from our own destruction.  The overwhelming christian way of thinking in this country has to end...it simply isnt working.

Until now, that Graphitti Designs edition was the one to own...This tops it due to it's oversized pages and superior quality printing.<br /><br />Want to see how this story was originally about about Captain Atom, Blue Beetle, and the Question (along with other Charlton characters) and how it changed to what it is?

You got it.<br /><br />Bottom line, I can't think of anything that could possibly be done or included that would make a superior edition to this.
B00005JLWN|5.0|For someone who's always been a fan of action movies, this was a treat. I mean, I didn't know what to expect, but as the movie went on I found myself cheering the hero on. <br /> <br />  All right, there are movies out there with better action and  higher budgets. <br />But this movie stands apart from the rest for several reasons. ***SPOILERS**** <br /> <br />1. Christian Bale is in it.  I don't know what it is about him but he invests so much into each role he plays that it just draws you in. As an actor, he makes you care for the character John Preston. <br />2. You see the hero's character unfold before your eyes and you cheer him on as he comes to the inescapable conclusion that he needs to use his talents to right wrongs.  <br />3. The spectacular action in the end.  I found myself running out of breath just watching one fight after the other. Gun kata is especially cool. <br />4. I see John Preston as every man.  He's a family man in a position to be able to do something about fighting for those he loves, and he does. Spectacularly. <br />5. The puppy scene won me over completely. <br />
B0000047EC|4.0|Sometimes listening too closely and too critically impedes the hearing process. Charlie Haden and Pat Metheny delve into the realms of quiet, pulsing, minimalist presentation, expressing a shared vision inspired by calm.<br /><br />Admittedly, it's taken some time for me to appreciate the strengths of this collaboration between these two musicians from Missouri, the hear me state, for purposes of this review. Rather than listening head on, I've found that listening obliquely seems best. The melodies swirl around in aural pools, languish a bit, and meander on like leaves floating on a slow creek.<br /><br />There is plenty of space here, as Mr. Haden sometimes tacks a counterpoint on his bass and sometimes takes the lead. Mr. Metheny does not really forge any flights of fancy yet he achieves a great deal by keeping within the lines.<br /><br />Certainly not for everyone, \\"Missouri Sky\\" has and will offer a calming grace to many.
B00008G9JO|5.0|This is really a great CD. All the songs in it are just great. The music has such quality, that you can talk freely about a R&R masterpiece..!!! I love it!!!
B000AM4PBS|5.0|The reason to buy this (to the reviewer below):  The sydicated episodes are CUT.  Even what was shown on NBC isn't complete.  The DVD's have MORE footage than was shown on NBC, and way more than is shown in syndication.

0790729407|2.0|I watched this movie in preparation for a trip to Dublin, per a recommendation from the Rick Steve's series to assist in understanding recent history of Ireland.  While we were in Dublin, we met two teenage girls who said they were required to watch the movie in school for the same reason.
B000002LND|2.0|Uh, Dont quite know what to say about this release, besides the fact that it is Lackluster and not Great..Its just, well-okay.. <br />Madonna was big in the 80's, that decade that we all look back on and cringe..well, i believe she is one of those reasons..I think she became talented in the 90's w/ Ray of Light and w/ the Secret Album...that is GOOD Pop Music...Her and Mariah are vying for the Crwon of the Most Successful and Still Relevant Diva Title, But My Money is On Mariah b/c in 100 years I think people will soon realize Madonna was never really pushing any buttons, she was just a clever girl who was always interested in making as much money as she could--she knows how to manipulate the shhep-le...But Mariah's Voice will stand the test of time..no matter how she dresses...Buy Mariahs four disc Greatest Hits/Remix Albums..or even her #1's c.d...That is FANTASTIC Pop...
B00006LI4S|5.0|Today is my 50th birthday and I treated myself to a great show of David Gilmour. Yeah, I'm getting older and so is David. But I'm so tired of my Pink Floyd CDs, and this great DVD allows both myself and Floyd to age gracefully. These versions are actually fresh to hear and to see. And the biggest treat for me was when David brought fellow Pink Floyd member Richard Wright up on the stage to sing a beautiful version of his song Breakthrough from his Broken China CD of 1996. So far as I know this is Rick's only performance of his solo work. Too bad! But at least we have this one song to cherish. And also along for the show: Floyd saxophonist Dick Parry. It's just Gilmour and Parry opening the show with a spare but beautiful Shine On You Crazy Diamond. It's a wonderfully intimate show, beautifully filmed and recorded. Every Floyd fan should have this.

B00005K3OT|5.0|\\"Chocolat\\" is delicious! It captures the spirit and lusciousness of chocolate and personifies it in a terrific cast. Not only the writer of the original story, but the director, too, must be chocolate lovers. Highly recommended.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Whoa, man.  Take a deep breath.  Here we have it: the cinematic equivalent of \\"Hamlet\\" -- meaning, the piece of work that re-writes all the rules on its own terms, and so creates a newer, bigger idea of the \\"Self\\" in art (and thus, in the world). <br /> <br />Nothing you can say about this thing can fully encompass what it IS.  There's a whole universe in there.  Do I know what this movie \\"really\\" means?  Of course not!  (or, only a little bit.) <br /> <br />Some movies are like a deep, clear well that people can drink from, and get refreshed by, again and again over time.  But \\"Persona\\" is like the enormous underground aquifer that feeds all of those wells.  Almost every really serious movie that's been made since 1966 has had to come to terms with it: either they are kinda-sorta attempted re-makes of \\"Persona\\" (everything from 'Two-Lane Blacktop' to 'Apocalypse Now'), or else they are struggling to avoid its immense gravitational pull -- the way that American novelists from the '70s until now had to either imitate \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" or else pretend that it didn't exist.  You can never really get to the bottom of this movie: it shows you something new and startling every time you watch it.   <br /> <br />What's really astonishing is that it all unfolds on such a \\"small\\" scale: the whole thing is really just two women in a hospital and then a summer house, with no big sets, no effects, and almost no \\"story\\" to speak of.  Kind of like splitting the atom: you had no idea so much energy was hidden inside that tiny speck. <br /> <br />One of the five or so films* that I would use to try and explain to space-aliens what \\"movies\\" are, and why they're so cool, and so important.  And don't get me started on that opening sequence.... <br /> <br /> <br />(* -- for those who care, the others are \\"Casablanca,\\" \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" Renoir's \\"Grand Illusion,\\" Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" and a choice handful of Bugs Bunny/Daffy Duck shorts.) <br /> <br />
B00004RFCM|5.0|at first i thought this was a really dumb show so i never bothered to watch it. not even once. until i went to camp last summer and met this girl who watched it all the time. she told me it was actually very good and that i should give it a chance. i had nothing to watch one day and sex and the city just happened to be the only somwhat decent thing on at the time. to my surprise, it was funny. i ca hardlyget enoghu of it now. maranda kills me.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far my favorite show of any out there, including other Joss Whedon efforts.  Not a single bad or even mediocre episode; all of varying degrees of goodness and greatness!  An amazing tour-de-force for which all of the elements that make up any TV show that is worth watching, came together in a most dazzling way!  And to think that I swore before this to never watch another western, ha!

B0009WFFS6|2.0|This would have been a great Cream show if Jack and Ginger had toured with a handful of great guitarists instead tired, worn out Eric Clapton.  Eric's a bit of a bore -- it's obvious when he's interviewed -- but proved without doubt in his playing.  If they had toured with Eddie Van Halen, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck and Robin Trower - this would have been the show it should have been. There's just enough here to get you excited, then let down everytime you focus on Eric's horrible tone and thoughtless solos.  If Eric had played a different 335 and SG everynight, he could have sold each for a small fortune afterwards, and made the show sound stronger.  I don't think he ever even used the bridge position on his stratocaster!
0061040967|4.0|This book was fun, mostly for the pictures.  I found the short novella that went with the pictures to be a bit on the watered down side for a Pratchett novel.  It seemed like Pratchett was trying to come up with a short story line that he could fit everyone's favorite characters in without taking up too much page space.<br /><br />But the pictures make up for it.  My favorite is the picture of Death with the kitten.  It is exactly how I imagined Pratchett's Death to look like.  The other pictures are just as rich in detail and depth and make this book a must look for die hard Pratchett fans.
B00001W9G0|3.0|I remember sinking down into a theatre seat and being totally riveted by this movie the first time I saw it, nearly 20 years ago. From the first, haunting notes of the song, The Way we were, to the incredibly handsome face of Hubbell (Robert Redford), I was entranced.<br /><br />When I saw the sparks fly between Hubbell (Redford) and Katie (Streisand)from their first days at college to their later reunion, years later, I hoped that maybe these two very different souls could make it, in spite of their very different values, background and... most importantly, Katie's umwavering and uncompromising  political commitment.<br /><br />I was that much of a romantic. I was that young. An older, wiser person might have seen this as the impossible situation it was.<br /><br />And yet... who hasn't felt an attraction to the person that logic says is all \\"wrong\\" for you but for whom you still yearn, against all reason? Who hasn't felt instant physical attraction, so intense that you nearly convince yourself that it is \\"love\\", must be love?  Who hasn't been swept up by passion, hope and yearning that it will all work out somehow, even as the danger signs become clearer and clearer?<br /><br />This movie is for those people. When I was much younger, I used to be one of those people.<br /><br />Now, years later, as I watched it again, I wondered how I could have been so sucked up by this movie. While I still admired Katie's committment to her political beliefs, I also saw how strident she was, how judgmental and intolerant....so much so that I had to wonder why Hubbell stuck around, subjecting himself to her angry tirades, which seemed more like a prolonged temper tantrum of a young child trying to batter his adversary down by sheer anger and willpower. She sulked,she stormed out of parties, she launched verbal attacks on Hubbell's friends - and yet he stuck around? Nope, this time around I didn't buy it, although her YEARNING for him was palpable and touching.<br /><br />But in the end, he remains true to his background as the perpetual, charming Golden Boy, always in demand but never truly challenging himself to be the \\"best\\", at least not in Katie's view. He is willing to \\"settle\\" - but she is not. He is content to have a decent job, a happy life and plenty of luxuries and playthings (sailboats, expensive wine) to pass the time.<br /><br />And THAT is the crux of the problem. The differences that drew them so intensely to each other, even fueled their passions of being with an strange, unique and ultimately unknowable person...didn't hold over the long term.<br /><br />The wonder is that anyone found this movie even remotely convincing, let alone romantic....but then, there are some actors who pull you into even the worst of movies as their charisma simply takes over. Redford and Streisand are two such actors and it is a credit to their skill that they drew audiences into theatres to watch this film.r /> <br />But in the end, he remains true to his background as the perpetual, charming Golden Boy, always in demand but never truly challenging himself to be the \\"best\\", at least not in Katie's view.

B000059Z8J|4.0|\\"Superman\\" is one of the first films I ever saw in a movie theater when I was a child.  It wowwed me then, and it still does today. <br /> <br />Christopher Reeve made such an indelible impression as the Man of Steel and Clark Kent that I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  Reeve convincingly created Superman and Clark Kent as two very separate people.  Unlike many other actors who have played this role, Reeve made Clark his own person, not just Superman with glasses and a suit. <br /> <br />In addition, this movie has some of the greatest cinematography I have ever seen, especially the scenes on Krypton and in Smallville.  And the special effects, though they may be considered primitive by today's CGI standards, are spectacular.  I'm glad this movie was made before computer imaging took over the world of cinema special effects because it actually looks better and more real to me than if it was done with CGI.  When I look at this movie, it not only looks but feels to me like Reeve is defying gravity. <br /> <br />This DVD has a lot of excellent bonus features for Superman fans like myself, and the film is shown in widescreen, as it should be.  Some of the scenes which were added back in the film I think were unnecessary, though interesting.  I could see why they were removed from the original version.   <br /> <br />In some ways, I like \\"Superman II\\" even more than the original because of the sequel's faster pace and script structure, but no other superhero movie is as epic and as grand as this one.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I just read the books and had never seen the movies.  This was the movie truest to the book.  Can't understand why they class this as a kids series.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Tom Hanks is terrific as a FedEx engineer who is marooned on an island after his plane crashes.  \\"Cast Away\\" proves that a great actor, with a good script, can tell a compelling story even if he's the only one in it. <br /> <br />Though the script unfolds in a predictable way, Hanks keeps it afloat (no pun intended).  Director Robert Zemeckis could have tightened the film a bit here and there, but \\"Cast Away\\" is still an engaging adventure story about how the will to live can help us survive.
B000002WPI|5.0|CLASSIC! Nuff said....got my first taste on a plane on the way to Germany in 1994, was a fiend for the Wu for years!   Still stands as one of the best hip-hop albums ever, and one of my favorite albums period!
B000B5IPLK|4.0|Let's face it, for a singer, no matter their caliber of expertise, it is hard for a singer to sing live.  Only the most distinguished and artistically credible singers can sing live, let alone release a whole disc of live performances.  Live performances in general are often plagued with pitch problems by the singer, recording quality, and a plethora of other minute issues that add up to making a very mediocre recording.  Alicia Keys, even on a live recording, never fails to amaze.<br /><br />True, this recording is not the caliber of her two official studio albums, but I don't think the critics, nor the fans truly expected it to be.  It is what it is and that is a live recording that is somewhat unplugged (acoustic).  What is innovative about these so penned \\"unplugged\\" recordings is the fact that the arrangements of her hits have been altered slightly to make them unique.  While that technique doesn't work for all artists recording live discs, it works well for Alicia Keys as she produces a notably cool reworking of \\"Heartburn\\" as well as \\"If I Was Your Woman\\" and \\"How Come U Don't Call Me\\".  While the other reworkings are good, they don't stand out as much as the above.<br /><br />Some tracks weren't really reworked, and hence work very well all naturale.  Key's slight addition of certain nuances in \\"Fallin'\\" and \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" make for two incredibly tweaked performances of two already history making tracks.  Keys also incorporates several new/ remakes including the incredible new first single \\"Unbreakable\\", new song \\"Stolen Moments, and \\"Wild Horses\\" feat Adam Levine (though Keys steals the show here more than Levine, who has sounded better on other collaborations).  The huge collab between Common, Mos Def, and Alicia Keys has a catchy chorus \\"Love It Or Leave It Alone\\", but it is more hookiness than substance.<br /><br />Most importantly, this album is another nice addition to the discography of a neo-soul diva.  4 stars

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this CD to listen to it before I saw the musical. This CD is great. I love the music and I am sure I will enjoy the musical now that I have listened to the music. This is a must have for any fans of the Wizard of Oz.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|In my opinion, the review written by Amazon editor Elisabeth Vincentelli was way off the mark.  This soundtrack is one of the most toe-tapping, singable, catchy musicals to come along in quite some time.  The songs stay in your head after you play them.  Everyone I know that has seen this show comments on the music, and the strong vocalists.  Just the other day, the teenage kids from the Arts Magnet high school down the street from office building where I work were skipping down the road, hand in hand, singing \\"One Short Day.\\"  It was like something out of the film \\"Fame.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Defying Gravity\\" IS Chicken Soup for the Witch, as the editor put it. How beautifully ironic....Most of the songs are filled with such hope and optimism, coming from the character of a green witch, whom quite honestly scared me to death when I was a child.  <br /> <br />How about some Chicken Soup for the Lousy Editorial Writer of the West? She writes as though she has seen and ...I guess from hher comments....hated way too many musicals, to even enjoy the genre. I read her review before buying the CD, and before seeing the show, and all I could think while experiencing it over and over, was how wrong she was.  SO, I felt I must strongly recommend this musical soundtrack to anyone who loves theater, the musical genre, the Wizard of Oz, flying monkeys, underdog stories, and the dramatic irony that makes for truly interesting theater. Listen to the samples and see for yourself. <br />

6302824729|5.0|Having worked and lived in five countries, doing from Law to Commerce and watching thousands of movie in a few languages for the past 25 years, I CAN CONFIRM with experience that the KArate Kid II (even all of them) belongs to classics with quality! <br />True, the story is not a profound dramatical one or the acting is not amazing but all of it, still, has got a high level of good acting: the characters are all believable and most of all, you feel for them. <br />I, myself, have lived in quite a big porcentage the Karate Kid story! I lived with my Sensei for a year and he taught me what Karate is all about, one on one: Honor, Sharing, Friendship, Inner Peace, Equilibre even to grow into yourself like a strong tree and of course, techniques for self defense ONLY at the last resort. I did the training on the beach, the Karate chops on trees, the philosophical research into my soul... <br /> <br />ALL THIS, is represented by the Karate Kid movies. Judge them for what they are: A \\"can do\\" story with tolerance of different people and how to turn you anger into peace and harmony somehow...It never pretented to be anything else. Be dreamers and realize your dreams! the Karate Kid is what people need again nowadays: an underdog tale that comes back for winning especially into himself by being a better person

B000AARKOO|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is a movie that got a bad rap at the box office.  It's a movie about medieval siege warfare, and probably the most accurate depiction which you will ever see.  Hollywood however loves flaming projectiles.  In Middle Ages they had Greek fire, however they did not use flaming rocks or arrows.  A better title for this movie would have been Crusade. <br /> <br />This movie shows what can go wrong when people start taking greed and fanaticism in the name of religion or any other subject to far, and forget our basic humanity.  <br /> <br />The movie is visually stunning, and the extras are very good.  Particularly the production grid, and Hollywood vs.  History.  If you find that you like this movie: you might also like, The Wind and The Lion, The Lion in Winter, The Adventures of Robin Hood, and Ivanhoe with Robert Taylor.  Becket with Richard Burton is also available on VHS here at Amazon. <br />

0307276902|4.0|In his memoir \\"A Million Little Pieces,\\" James Grey wrote about his days at a rehabilitation center in Minneosta as a severe drug addict and alcoholic. Wanted in three states for various felonies, he found himself on a plane heading towards Chicago, with a broken nose, bloodied eyes, wounds on his cheeks, four teeth were missing, and basically no recollection of what happened. His parents met him at the airport and they drove him to the rehab center. In rehab, James wrote about the gruelling headaches and vomits, the difficulty of concentrating and just plain difficult. There, he became friends with a Las Vegas mobster, a judge, an administrator of a Catholic university and a former prostitute.  <br /> <br />This book is extremely disturbing and raw. James Grey was extremely graphic in his description of pain and suffering. He described having gone through root canal surgeries on two of his teeth without any medication and the picture that he painted was one very mesmerizing and yet disturbing. He was successful in describing his days in the rehab and his slow but successful completion of the program. I would not recommend this to anyone as it was very graphic and contained lots of expletives.

B0000039LE|4.0|While my favorite 'Halloween' will probably always be Part 5 'The Revenge of Michael Myers,' this first chapter will probably always be seen by most people as the best and the definitive chapter. Turning the clock back, people at this time were used to black and white horrors. To be sure, color televisions had become available in the 60s, but black and white televisions were still more popular. (Adam West from Batman will claim with some convincing arguments that the Batman series of the 60s was responsible for the growth of color tvs, but I am digressing.) During the 70s, color televisions were starting to become more and more popular. So this first Halloween was dealing with a transition in moving horror movies from black and white to color. (The color is there, but it is not garrish. It is somewhat controlled.) If you are reading this, you probably don't need me to tell you that the story revolves around a mental patient (Michael Myers) who killed his sister when he was but a child. Some years later, he escapes and goes on a killing  spree. Jamie Lee Curtis seems to be the one Michael is after, but we won't find out the whole reason until Part 2. (While this movie was a horror classic in itself, and while this great package has a neat start and end, it was arranged to allow for a continuation of the story.) While on the surface, it may APPEAR to be a typical slasher, it is anything but that. Perhaps you are asking why. Well, the answer lies in the hero Dr. Loomis, portrayed nearly to perfection by the wonderful Donald Pleasence. Much of the horror lies not in Michael's killing, but the psychological turmoil the benevolent Dr. Loomis suffers as he tries to stop this monster Michael Myers. Dr. Loomis is very well defined in the fact that he DOES NOT always click well with his peers. I.E. When because of his knowledge of Michael's evil, he refers to him as 'it,' his peer asks if he could refer to 'it' as him, and Dr. Loomis in an annoyed manner answers: 'If you wish.' Another aspect of the scarred but benevolent Dr. Loomis's character is that while he clearly has an impressive amount of education, he still has some notable redneckish traits. I.E. When he tells his superiors that Michael has stolen a car, they deny that Michael would be able to drive. Dr. Loomis answers: 'He was doing very well last night. Maybe someone here gave him lessons.' I could go on and on, but there is no need for that. The chemistry between the monstrous Michael and the determined hero Dr. Loomis is a piece of history not only in the 70s, but horror in general. I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who haven't seen it, but I will say that while the ending would have been perfect on its own, it hints that there will be more to come. If you like this classic, please don't waste your time with the farces 'H2O' and 'Resurrection.' BUT PLEASE DO see 'Halloween 2' which follows this story almost from the moment 'Halloween' ends. Also, do see 'Halloween 4, The Return of Michael Myers,' 'Halloween 5, The Revenge of Michael Myers,' and 'Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers.' SIDE NOTE: If you like the wonderful Donald Pleasence in this series, check him out as one of the three wise men in the beautiful \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (1977) and as Dr. Seward in the phenomenal \\"Dracula\\" (1979)..'

The band wasted no time recruiting former Flotsam & Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted and churning out the covers EP \\"Garage Days Re-Revisited\\", but the issue remained just how much of an impact Burton's influence had on Metallica's material.  <br />When \\"And Justice For All\\" was finally released in late 1988 it was not only a breath of fresh air but the dawning of a new era as well. \\"Justice\\" furthers the sociopolitically charged vision of \\"Master of Puppets\\", a bit icier and more distant, but no less potent in either it's intelligent lyrics or the increasingly challenging song structures. \\"Blackened\\" is the lead off track, and despite having enough song ideas to fill an entire EP, the melange of riffs works well as a cohesive whole. Metallica weren't the first thrash band to express an environtmental lean, but with lyrics such as \\"see our Mother [Earth]/put to death/see our Mother die\\" there weren't many fans who were ready to write them off as born again hippies.  <br /> <br />The title track and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" continue to heighten the standards for the rest of the album until we at last arrive at what is perhaps Metallica's all-time magnum opus: \\"One\\". When Lars announced in pre-release interviews that the song would be about a guy with no appendages, no sense of sight and sound, and no way of communicating with the outside world it reminded of those old jokes. Ie. what do you call a man with no arms and no legs that hangs on the wall? Art. What do you call a man with no arms and no legs swimming in a pool? Bob. Etc etc.  <br /> <br />Of course the end result turned out to be nothing so exploitative, but instead a tone poem set to the theme of the old Dalton Trumbo flick \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\". This is not only one of their more complex songs thematically but it's far from aimless art school wankering, building up to a riveting climax and a powerful denouement. As apostscript, \\"One\\" has turned into one of those oft-played tunes that has more than worn out it's welcome amongst many rock fans, similar to other songs like \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" (or \\"Highway to Hell\\" for that matter). However, that in no way detracts from the objective quality of the song, and it's only the radio programmers we have to blame for ruining all of the above examples through unmitigated repetition.  <br /> <br />The truth is, \\"And Justice For All\\" is equally as compelling as \\"Master of Puppets\\" from a songwriting and performance perspective. There is only one reason I can see that it doesn't get the same amount of reverence as its precursor, and that is the infamous production of Fleming Rasmussen. Fleming also produced \\"Puppets\\", and this would be his last Metallica production, so he has been given the blame over the years for essentially ruining what should have been a flawless masterpiece. However, with the similarly awful production on \\"St Anger\\" I can't help but wonder if the band members didn't push for this sonic experimentation themselves.  <br /> <br />Here's hoping that one day the masters will be brushed off and remixed (a la the Beatles' recent \\"Let It Be: Naked\\") and \\"And Justice For All\\" will be recognized for the landmark that it is.  <br />
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Nick Cave has always been an interesting figure in music with: strong, passionate, gritty and romantic songs that are pure intensity and yet have personal side to them.  Cave, being ever original produced \\"Abattoir Blues and Lyre of Orpheus\\" are two albums simultaneously released in the same packaging which is almost too artistic for a mass release (but this is Nick Cave).  The Abattior Blues is a more rock/gospel sound that is somewhat less experimental that other Cave works.  However don't think this weak music. While sounding uplifting at times and miserable at others, the wry and strong, although less guttural, Cave is present in al of this and while it isn't so raw it is very enjoyable.  \\"The Lyre of Orpheus\\" sounds far more in line with other Cave Works and almost harkens back to his early days with the Bad Seeds.  Don't worry, this isn't a regression,  in fact some of the songs on this album are very experimental and among my favorites are the \\"lyre of Orpheus\\" and \\"supernatural\\" and \\"oh Children\\" which has a great gospel sound combined with Cave's low groveling.  Both of these tracks are straightforward but not simple and require a few listens to sink in and become appreciated.  This album is filled with that dark gospel, fire and brimstone sermonizing, that makes Cave so interesting.    This is a great double album that might prove to be a great introduction for the new fan or a cherished work for the hardened Cave fan.  This one won't take long to \\"get into\\" and will be enjoyable for a long while because of its large amount of content and its deliberate style that juxtaposes the misery and joy.  I was expecting that I would be appreciating one of the albums more however but they are getting equal play after lots of listens and are equally great. Buy this one.    Ted Murena
B0006A9FKA|4.0|While \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" wasn't as drop-dead funny as I'd hoped it would be, in the end it amounted to much more than the dogpile of semi-related gags my preconceptions would have necessarily entailed it to be. The movie starts off a bit slow, the laughs early on coming few and far between for the first half hour, but in hindsight this is all legitimate character development. When I say that the film turned out to be something more than it promised to be, what I mean is exactly this: whereas most filmmakers would have focused on the slapstick possibilities inherent in a world full of slow moving, incompetent zombies, \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" instead treats this as a mere backdrop to illustrate the quest for one man's redemption. Shaun is a man who, through a combination of moral sluggishness and a willingness to be walked on by those more assertive than he, finds himself entirely behind the eightball in life at nearly every turn. The first scene in the film shows Shaun already on thin ice with his girlfriend. To the viewer, it becomes obvious that Shaun's boorishness comes from a fear of going outside the box of his everyday routine, and why should he when even in the course of this routine things never fail to go wrong? But his girlfriend doesn't quite see it this way, and whatever sympathy she may have for Shaun is rapidly eroding away under a veneer of strained patience. To placate her, Shaun cooks up a romantic evening at an upscale restaurant to celebrate their anniversary, then conveniently forgets to call in the reservation until the day of the gig, at which point, of course, the question of a table is decidedly OUT of the question.It's against these events that the zombies first begin to make their appearance, at first as individuals who are easily mistaken for drunks and the homeless by the hapless Shaun and his roommate. The zombies begin to gradually increase in number until a fateful encounter in the back garden convinces Shaun of their lifelessness, at which point the movie becoms a rescue mission to salvage his mom and his (now ex-)girlfriend. There are a number of other auxiliary characters, most of which are fleshed out quite well considering most horror flicks would relegate them as faceless flesh-bait for the antagonists. To say too much more would be to lessen the effect of some of the key plot twists, although to be honest most of these twists will be familiar to fans of previous zombie films. But the film isn't to be noted for it's plot, but for the way it handles it's characters, particularly Shaun, who is shaken out of his cocoon of inaction by the even greater incompetence of his friends and family. Once survival itself is at stake and things are no longer just a matter of comfort and convenience, Shaun finds a resolve inside himself that he likely didn't know he had (his entourage certainly seems surprised). And yet the movie never descends into an over-the-top Rambo cliche, like the American version surely must when Hollywood inevitably gets around to remaking \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", and it's the small scale of the human drama that makes it that much more realistic, and hence more effective.  <br />
B00006JSS8|4.0|Stevie Wonder got me through high school, which I hated with a passion.  I'd be feeling down and I'd play his music and it just reallly touched my heart.  Each song brings back memories and some of them gave me inspiration.  This is a great CD if you want to chart his growth.  I was always amazed by how he seemed to be able to \\"see\\" things that were going on in society, and how he could also write terrific love songs.  This is a good CD to sing along to, I recommend it and also \\"Original Musiquarium\\".
0689835604|5.0|My son (15 months) absolutely loves this book. He will sit and do the flaps over and over and over and over. It has held up really well to his tug and folds (although he was able to eat a corner off a flap!). Great book. Good for working on teaching basic body parts too (hands, feet, nose, eyes, mouth, etc). We liked this book so much we ordered a similar book by the same author (yet to be delivered).
B00005KHJM|4.0|I was very happy to finially get to see and now own a copy of the Wicker Man.  Besides being a longtime fan of both Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward, this film covers a topic that is of immense interest to me.  Robin Hardy has gone to enormous lengths to painstakingly create an accurate portrait of the pagan practices of the ancient Britons and Scottish, and he went to equally great lengths to create these scenes in stunning artistic beauty.  Who can argue that the remote Scottish Isles are some of the most beautiful places on earth?<br /><br />It is with great pleasure that I recommend this movie for anyone to see a true picture of what a pagan ritual might look like.  Of course, minus the unfortunate human sacrifice.  The performances by Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee will satisfy and nothing is left out, much of the information from a historical view is accurate and it is obvious that there was much research in the making of this.<br /><br />Do see THIS version: alas there is a remake in the works as I write this featuring Nickolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in the lead roles, changing the locale to the US away from the British Isles, and no doubt will change much of the meaning.  In addition, Robin Hardy himself is suing the producers of the remake to remove his name from the list of credits, as he wants nothing to do with it.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because to a modern audience, it might seem a bit dated, but I do highly recommend it!
B00008OLYN|1.0|this is undoubtedly a very, very good effort by Opeth.  melodic,interesting, powerful, tortured are adjectives that come to mind.  that this can all be accomplished using a \\"soft-non-loud\\" approach is a credit to them.  the guitar and drum work is outstanding. from start to finish it's consistently excellent.   i actually would rate this 4 3/4 stars (not 5) because i although the vocals are lovely, i would have enjoyed a little less smoothness. i'm sure their intention was to NOT introduce any rough/screaming vocals on this album. it's just that lately i've discovered BURZUM and man, that guy expresses pain! but, anyway, any fan of pink floyd/david gilmour, tool, or any mature death metal fan with an introspective side will love this.  as a matter of fact, i can't think of too many people who wouldn't find something to enjoy in this.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Questionable adaptation of the comic book Hellblazer has of all the people Keanu Reeves playing the role of supernatural misfit John Constantine who is trying to save the world from a conspiracy to bring fourth the son of Satan, who is trying to enter the earth. The huge problem that this film has is of course Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the point of the film becoming a joke and the screenplay is way too incoherent to understand most of the things that are happening in the film. The lackluster dialog seem more like a USA cable film that a real movie that was releases in the theaters and the special effects don't hold any ground what so ever and they get repetitive after a while, losing most of it's attended impact along the way. Some of the other actors in the film don't even seem to care about their performances with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, whose game and way too good for this type of film performance does more for the film than it should have. She actually makes you care and understand her character and makes her a real three dimensional person who you would have liked know more about and follow instead of the tissue paper dimensional character of John Constantine and his fellow lackeys. Another actor who does way more than he should have is Djimon Hounsou and he does not have enough screen time to make a better impact as well as Peter Stormare, who great interpretation of the King of Darkness is just in the movie for about four minutes.  <br /> <br />If you want to see it, see it for the game performance of Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare because other than their performances, there is really nothing here to see.  <br />

B000006O7C|5.0|greed.  that's what this is.  one disc of incomplete productions and one disc of very rough demos, for the exorbitant price of 14.99.  what an atrocity.  who would ever buy something so obviously calculated to exploit jeff buckley's zealous fanbase?  his mother, who assembled this, must be a horrible woman.<br /><br />or, maybe, it's a brilliant album (of tracks buckley was disatisfied with) accompanied by a second disc of outtakes and rarities, packaged together for the price of one cd.  maybe buckley's mother wanted to give something special to his rabid fans without soaking them for every penny they have.  i may quibble with the bonus-track-import releases, but this release is a jeff buckley fan's joy.  rather than release one great, but unfinished, album on it's own, then follow it up with a disc of outtakes and rough demos from the same sessions, the two are joined.  this way you're basically getting two discs for the price of one.<br /><br />disc one is worth the price of admission alone.  from the angry eco-terrorism of 'the sky is a landfill' to the haunting melancholy of 'you & i' it is a display of what we lost when buckley drowned.  disc two is very rough, but shows where buckley may have taken the final album had he lived.  as such, it's not something you'll play over and over again, but it's worth hearing to get some idea for what could have been.  you'll mourn the loss, then you'll go back to the first disc and celebrate what we're so blessed to have.<br /><br />[by the way, buckley lost his only grammy nomination, best vocal performance (the sky is a landfill), to lenny kravitz (fly), of all people]

B00005JMUA|2.0|With the huge box office success and critical acclaim for \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\", you can assume that expectations were extremely high for the final act in Quentin Tarentino's twisted tale of vengeance and mayhem, \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\".  The big question surrounding the movie was, `Can the second film possibly live up to the first one, in terms of story and entertainment value, and as an overall movie?'  The answer is actually quite mixed.  But before I give you the reasons for why the response to the movie was so mixed, I will give you the basic plot synopsis for \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\". <br /> <br />Picking up directly where \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" left off, `The Bride' is continuing her bloody quest for vengeance on her former mentor and lover, Bill, and his team of twisted killers.  With \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\", the training for `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), is explored to show the audience how she is capable of killing with such ruthless efficiency.  After dispatching her brand of justice to the majority of Bill's assassins, `The Bride' doesn't have very much farther to go before reaching her ultimate goal of killing Bill.  But, the road to Bill is plagued with misfortune, and `The Bride' is going to need to use all of her training to survive. <br /> <br />Now that the plot synopsis is out of the way, I can get back to why response to \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" was less than stellar, when compared to the response to \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\".  With \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\" director and writer Quentin Tarentino delivered audiences a twisted tale of revenge, that was filled with plenty of violence, and not much in the way of exposition.  Whereas, in \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\", the violence is toned down, almost to the point of non-existence in some cases, to make room for the exposition.  The problem here is that audiences were expecting the rest of `The Bride' killing off all of her former crew and her mentor, with maybe some exposition to fill in some more of the how's and why's of the whole thing.  Instead, what audiences got was basically the origin of `The Bride', how she learned to fight, her relationship with Bill, and how the whole thing went south on them.  Basically, Quentin let down his audience by setting the bar too high for himself with \\"Kill Bill Volume 1\\".  In my opinion, Quentin would have been better off to drop in some of the exposition from \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" into `Volume 1' and spread the action out better over the two films.  Had he done these two things, audiences probably would have responded better to \\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\", and both movies would have been equally entertaining. <br /> <br />Although, personally I thought that neither film was all that great, but that's just me and I'm not that big of a Tarentino fan.  But overall, the two films are at least worth watching once. <br /> <br />\\"Kill Bill Volume 2\\" is rated R for violence and language.
B000A0GP0Y|3.0|Under the guiding hand of producer/star Adam Sandler, THE LONGEST YARD is a formulaic sports prison movie that accomplishes its goal to entertain for a couple of hours. Its goal is not to outdo the original, but it makes a decent, companion piece to the great and classic Burt Reynolds original. The inspired Sandler had the good sense of casting Burt Reynolds in the film in a key support role of 'Nate Scarboro'(originated by Michael Conrad-HILL STREET BLUES) and Reynolds had the good mind in accepting it because it was tailor-made for him now that its 30 years since the original was released. In an interview with Reynolds, he stated that he was apprehensive of the whole remake concept along with the fact that he created the 'Paul Crewe' character. However, he realized that the film wasn't 'Shakespeare', so why not? Robert Aldrich directed the first 'YARD' which had a familiar theme from some of his earlier films (FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE DIRTY DOZEN), showing men in dire situations rising to the occasion. Peter Segal directs the sequel with men making smart-alec remarks in comedic situations. In the original there are characters. The remake has caricatures. Also, the original worked as a dramedy, whearas the remake is more comedy. The original film had a bit more suspense with plot twists in the storyline that leads up to the big game. In the remake, the plot simply has to get from Point A to Point B. Lastly, the creators completely missed the meaning of the title of the film which is exemplified by the final play of the game. Sandler/Paul Crewe scores the winning touchdown  and the inmates (The Mean Machine) win the game.  If one watches the original version compared to the remake, one will see why the film is called THE LONGEST YARD.  If the people involved were more creative, they should have had Burt Reynolds reprise the 'Paul Crewe' character and do a sort of THE HUSTLER/COLOR OF MONEY-type sequel. Overall, a typical Adam Sandler crowd pleaser that retains most of the original film's screenplay with some added contemporary themes.

B0000A9GLS|3.0|This 2003 film is a mystery as well as a horror film. Ten strangers are stranded in a desolate motel on a stormy night. One by one they are getting murdered. It's a classic mystery as the guilt seems to fall on several characters. There's also an interconnected story about a murderer whose psychiatrist is trying to get a last minute reprieve.  <br />John Cusack plays the part of a limousine driver who has once been a cop. Ray Liotta plays a cop who's transporting a prisoner. There's also a newly married couple who argue a lot, a prostitute who's giving up her way of life and another woman who's been injured in a accident as well as her husband and young son who never speaks a word. There's also a strange motel clerk with secrets of his own.  <br />But this is not a usual \\"whodunit\\". No way. The connection between the individuals in the motel is much stranger than that. And when this connection is finally revealed, I was annoyed. To my humble tastes, it was too contrived as it wanders into the unknown realms of the human psyche.  <br />Yes, it held my interest. Yes, there was some good acting. But I hated the ending and felt the writer had played a rotten trick on the audience. That's why I can only give this film a lukewarm recommendation.  <br />
0393317552|1.0|Ignores human, cultural & religious variables. Overemphasizes geographic variable. Diamond starts by stating that he has developed a new theory that is different from the geographic theory and then basically re-states the geographic theory.  Nothing new in this book. Also, Diamond goes out of its way never to mention Hebrews or Israel as a part of the fertile crescent. For example, on page 135, he depicts such artificial countries as Jordan, Syria & Iraq but does not depict Israel/Judea - the heart of the Fertile Crescent.<br />Also, this book is about 300 pages too long, repetitive & poorly written.<br />A Global Brain or a Lucipher Principle are much more interesting and better theories written by Howard Bloom
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon, as awesome as they are will never cross-over. This is the best UNDERGROUND metal band ever... talent spilling out of their white-whale spear-wounds, yet, this is not meant for your buddy who touts slipknot or chimaira... this isn't really metal for the sake of metal. this is talent for the sake of talent for the sake of art. i love these guys. i find it hard to cite their influences. they sound almost free of them. their drummer is possessed by the horned man they probably owe their souls to, and their arrangements are more complex than metallica before that band parted with their own souls. Mastodon, please put out an album every eighteen months, at the most. I'm already looking towards my next fix...
B000002N2P|5.0|What on earth's wrong with you guys? This album is great and sooo underrated! I love Walking Contradiction and I used to hate Geek Stink Breath but now I've heard it a couple of times I love it and the title's quite witty. I love the video for walking contradiction. And I'm sure the other songs are just as good. I was wrong about Greenday being rubbish! What a stupid thing to think! Silly me! But it is just one of ten fantastic albums! Listen to this, they'll be one of the greatest bands in history! <br />
B0007GAEGC|5.0|Among the 5 fantastic female artists performing in Celtic Woman's traditional Irish music DVD including Mairead, Orla, Chloe, Lisa, and Meav comes a modern performance diverse in every which way filled with heart moving vocals, a supporting orchestra, visual splendor, and mind tantalizing violin action. <br />Sheer vocal beauty dominated sets by Chloe and Meav in the clarity of their voices so pure, while rhythmic Orla enchanted the stage with her graceful charm embracing each movement of the music's ebb and flow.   Integrated within the progression of songs of traditional beauty were dazzling displays of Mairead's fiddle and violin to temper the listeners' souls, warm their hearts, and open their mind's inner joy to be eager for more and more.   No words spoken, my emotions listened to Mairead's fiddle communicate the definitions of love, harmony, and happiness with each touching measure of notes she played on that magical violin.   One can only be mesmerized by her golden tresses flowing about the stage shadowing her movement there and here.   But the grace and beauty keeps coming when Lisa Kelly climaxes the Celtic Woman stage with her powerful rendition of May It Be, from the motion picture Lord of the Rings.   With an awesome and magnificent vocal display that will humble kings her delivery brings the mightiest to their knees.  Combine the sparkle in her eyes with a wholesome smile to portray the beauty and joy of her music and you bring her performance to a level of intoxication.   Refrain from navigating your ships around these waters.   To the performers I humbly bow to your undaunted dedication to your art and years of training which guided you to such a magnificent degree of human achievement. <br />     <br /> <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|I thought that we had lost our beloved mysterious hero Batman with the disastrous 1997 baloney pile entitled \\"Batman & Robin\\" and unfortunately it did kill off what was then the current franchise of the comic book series. I was also completely astounded how they turned the series from a dark and beautiful series with \\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" and made it into a cartoon show with the fourth one. Even the first two \\"Batman\\" movies as great as they were, sometimes had problems with occasional cartoonish character and too much flamboyance that diluted the foreboding nature of the comic. But a full eight years and a different era altogether later, the entire movie adaptation is given a MUCH needed makeover and is completely revamped with the newest in the entire Batman saga entitled \\"Batman Begins\\" and let me tell you, WOW! This movie is totally awesome!! Forget every movie based on the two-sided individual even the ones done by Tim Burton. \\"Batman Begins\\" is the beginning of a whole new era in the saga and completely does away with any of the styles of old. I was shocked by how great and different BB really was.<br /><br /> As the title suggests, \\"Batman Begins\\" is the movie that takes Bruce Wayne back to his roots starting as a young boy who witnesses the gruesome murders of his parents during an attempted robbery outside a theatre. Increasingly alarmed by the increasingly corrupt justice system in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne  escapes to Tibet but is captured and is in a prison in the mountains where he meets a powerful mentor named Ducard (Liam Neeson) as well as Ra Al Ghul (Ken Watanbe) persuades him to join the League of Shadows and train him in various fighting skills and how to bring `real' justice to the world but Wayne does not buy into their extreme methods of `correcting' the wrongs of society and returns home to bring forth his own way of fighting for true justice. But Gotham City is under a threat from a fear pandemic caused by a `super drug' that is being engineered by someone named `Scarecrow' as well as by someone familiar from Wayne's past but who it is will be a major surprise and a major mistake in trusting.<br /><br /> Out of all of them, Christian Bale's rendition of Batman is by far the best out of all of them! I never thought I'd say but Bales performance outdoes even Michael Keaton's version of Bruce Wayne/Batman and the expressions are far more frightening yet more respectable than ever before! The expressions are highly realistic. My favorite however would be Liam Neeson's role as the mysterious Ducard. His character is without a doubt one of the greatest villainous roles that I've ever seen and it proves how Neeson is incredible at playing sophisticated villains.<br /><br /> I never thought they could ever do anything good with Batman after storming out in disgust with Schumacher's last movie (even Forever was worlds better than Robin) but I was proven wrong! Chris Nolan as director may have outdone himself in ways that we may never be able to estimate. Forget the old movies. They belong in the last century. \\"Batman Begins\\" is a brand new beginning of a new era in Batman's history!g engineered by someone named `Scarecrow' as well as by someone familiar from Wayne's past but who it is will be a major surprise and a major mistake in trusting.  <br /> <br /> Out of all of them, Christian Bale's rendition of Batman is by far the best out of all of them!

B000B5IPLK|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I have fallen in love with this album! I just bought it yesterday and I have been listening to it non-stop! Alicia Keys truly deserves an ocean of respect and recognition for her determination to bring music into a new and respected age. I think she has a beautiful and enchanting voice and I love to her the interludes she talks about in between songs but what I think makes Alicia so much better than any of the other cookie cutter girl crap that exists in the mainstream today is that she puts her music above anyhting elese. She is addicted to piano! That right there in my opinion is what sets her above many other mainstream artists today. She is so dedicated and passionate to music and this album is living proof that Alicia is one artist who takes her music seriously. I fell in love with her music the second I heard \\"Fallin'\\" and I'm still very much in love with it. If you are contemplating buying this album, I stronlgy urge you to put your hesitation aside and pcik this up. I don't think you'll be disapointed! This is one of the most well-crafted Unplugged albums ever made. If you're still hesitant, listen to Alicia's previous two albums and imagine them  ten times better! Never have I heard a young woman's dedication  emitted so beautifully in all my life than on this album! Comparing Adam Levine to Alicia on \\"Wild Horses\\" is incredible. She sounds so much better! My absolute favourites are \\"Fallin'\\"   \\"If I was your woman\\" and \\"If I ain't got you\\" (which is done so beautifully!)I really hope that you will buy this albumand listen to some seriously respectable music from an incredible talented and passionate young woman bound to only get better! She will knock your socks off! Alicia is definitely here to stay and I can't wait to hear her music grow even further. Please do yourself a favour for the day and pick this beautiful album up and hear something you've never heard before.

B000B0WODA|4.0|This is exactly what I expected, a little better than I hoped for, and not as good as it could be. I like almost all the songs, a few sound exactly the same, and I wish they didn't do the tempo change stutter-stop of \\"Take Me Out\\" on so many of the songs. It's becoming their MO now.  Not a good sign that they repeat it so early in their career.  But I like the addition of piano on the ballad tracks, and I like the song structures, for the most part, containing good hooks, but being a little more early 60's melodic.  HOWEVER, that being said, there was absolutely nothing wrong with the early 80's tinge of their first album.  Much tighter, much groovier, much more fun!  All in all, I dig it, I dig it as a follow-up, but I don't prefer it to the original.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie made an album that influenced rap hugely. This here is timeless material, he will always live through his music. CLASSIC!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I'll admit it. I like this CD. It's not as technically psychotic as Train of Thought, the lyrics aren't as good as Scenes from a Memory, and the music isn't as experimental as Awake, but my goodness, I love this album just the same! <br /> <br />I can sort of divide this album into two parts. The first, being the tracks 1 through 6, all felt a tad derivative, and I'm pretty sure I tasted sap while listening to \\"The Answer Lies Within\\", but it's not bad music by any means. It is, however, not as potent as their previous work, which could understandably upset some hardcore fans. I consider myself to be somewhat hardcore though, and i like these songs just the same. I have to give some extra credit to Mike Portnoy for the third installment of the AA songs, \\"The Root of all Evil\\". Man, I loved the first two, \\"The Glass Prison\\" and \\"This Dying Soul\\", and this one just keeps it going. Kudos. <br /> <br />The second half, being tracks 7 and 8....NOW THAT'S SOME GOOD STUFF! \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" shows, to me anyway, quite a bit of emotion. I enjoy their songs about religious fanaticism, and this might be one of their best, thanks to an magnificent orchestra and James Labrie's brilliant lyrics. I've heard quite a bit of negativity about James' singing and writing. I beg to differ: I love his songs and his voice, and I hope that he keeps up the good work. \\"Octavarium\\", a 24-minute behemoth of a title track, is another song that I just can't help but appreciate. It's just harmonically enjoyable, and it has its moments in the lyrics department (such as pt. III: Full Circle, which sports some fun verses by Mike Portnoy). <br /> <br />Overall, it's just a good album, plain and simple. I could make comparisons to other Dream Theater releases, but I don't feel like it. If you're looking for a CD with some enjoyable music, this is definitely a good purchase.

0312935080|5.0|I rarely give a book five stars, but I truly enjoyed this one on unabridged CD.  Connelly includes many twists and turns that actually make sense when you see the bigger picture.  My experience with mysteries is that sometimes the author tries to throw you off by twisting the plot so much that it loses its shape.  Not so in this book.  Connelly does a masterful job spinning a tale which will keep you guessing until the very end.

0684803356|5.0|For Whom The Bell Tolls is a tour de force in more ways then one and ends being Hemingway's best work because of how accesible it is to a general audience. <br /> <br />The first time I read this book I was 17 and I couldn't put it down which is a stark contrast to some of Hemingway's other works.  Works like The Sun Also Rises, and Farewell To Arms I think require a bit more maturity to appreciate but FWTBT is a good pick for a more advanced high school student.  The novel is more plot driven than Hemingway's other works and thus a bit more exciting and readable for the general public.  Hemingway's story of an American demolition expert caught up in a mission amidst the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War is both compelling, suspensefull, thoughtfull, brutal and heartwarming all at once. <br /> <br />Like many \\"classic\\" this book excels in most elements that are required for an amazing piece of literature.  The charactization is superb.  Robert Jordan and the supporting cast are fully fleshed out three dimensional characters.  Of course the book is written in the classic Hemingway style.  His own style of prose will put you into story as you live this three day adventure with the main characters.  Finally there are many layers and themes to this book as it has something to say about war, man, personal honor and the usual Hemingway themes. <br /> <br />This was Hemingway's second to last novel and the last of his more well known works.  Having read most of his books, I think Hemingway really hit his peak here and fine tuned his craft.  A truly amazing piece of work, FWTBT should really be read by everyone.  If you only read one Hemingway book in your life this should be it.  You don't need to be \\"well read\\" to appreciate this. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  There is a reason why certain books are deemed \\"classics\\".  FWTBT is the perfect example.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I must say that Porcupine Tree is one of the few bands out there that is creating moving, wonderful, intricate rock music that is relevent in our day and age. This British prog outfit has always been a force to be reckoned with and they step it up a notch on this 2005 smash. <br /> <br />From the first track you can tell this is something worth listening to. The powerful, driving force of \\"Deadwing\\" lures the listener in with sharp, tight arrangements and sequences of brilliant musicianship. Gavin Harrison's superb drumming deserves recognition, as well as lead vocalist and guitarist Steven Wilson. Wilson's vocals shine clearly in this track, as they do in every track. He is clearly one of the most underrated vocalists in music today, and is on par with Maynard James Keenan for most powerful voice in metal today. After the dreamy prog metal fest of the first track, we are flung into a hard-hitting track called \\"Shallow\\". On the surface it appears like any other rock song, but Porcupine Tree douses it their style and it is powerful from the first second to the last set of notes. <br /> <br />After \\"Shallow\\", the album slows down suddenly with the charming \\"Lazarus\\". It paves a new road for Porcupine Tree and stands as a piece of pure bliss amongst the heavy, troubled songs to follow. Once \\"Lazarus\\" fades out, the hard-hitting \\"Halo\\" punches in. A very driving beat and melody carry this one through heavy shredding and interesting ambient effects. This one has also become a favourite of PT's live show. <br /> <br />Next up is the prog treat \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\". This 12 minute epic contains every element of Porcupine Tree's dynamic audio attack and pulls it into an opus in one track. Wilson's vocals shine as the song charts great territory for the album. It gets heavier and heavier until the breaking point, where second quiet track comes in. This one is known as \\"Mellotron Scratch\\". It contains wonderful vocal harmonies as well as some very soothing ambience. <br /> <br />After \\"Mellotron\\" comes to a close, the best track (in my opinion) comes in. Known as \\"The Start of Something Beauitful\\", this track creates a mood like none other. It starts out quiet, with a buzzing bass line and flittering room noises that penetrate the ear into aura of majesty. Then, the thundering chorus slams in with the most emotion lines Wilson has ever sung. \\"The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give damn...\\" is the staple line in this troubled, distraught track. Powerful from start to finish, this song is the centerpiece for this album. After the dust settles, the album comes to a slow close with the quiet, soothing \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\". After that, the epilogue commences with a great re-recording of the Lightbulb Sun track \\"Shesmovedon\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is an album worthy of praise and widespread listening. Porcupine Tree remains the best kept secret in music today. Combining fierce prog metal signatures and pieces of sight, beautiful, trancy pop makes this British 4-piece one of the best bands in existence today. Go listen now, you won't be dissapointed.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|If you do, then watch this movie!<br /><br />When I was younger, I got the entire set of Nausicaa books from the library, and read them straight through. Looking back, they are one of the few manga I actually read through, and thats some five hundred pages of comic. Ever since, I've died to see this movie, and it didn't disappoint. It's a lot tamer than the comic version, which was not written with young children in mind, but it certainly has the enviromental and heritage themes intact. In fact, Miyazaki wrote this comic because they said his movie would fail unless he had a comic to base it on. So, he wrote it and it became the most popular comic to ever run in Animage magazine. To this day, one of the most beloved and recognized comics (besides akira toriyama's stuff) in Japan.<br /><br /> As an action animation, it still portrays its message, and has enough plot that you won't have to read 500 pages of comic to understand whats happening.<br /><br />-Being Miyazaki's first film, it has many of the nuances and plot devices of his later works. (First if you don't count the Lupin the Third work)- We start off with a young girl who lives in the Valley of Wind, and knows everything about the wind. She can control a small glider with jets through the air, and rides currents all over. But, everything is not just fun and games. A thousand years before, the people of the planet had great technology, and used it for everything, polluting the air/water/ground (think near future). But, they became power hungry and went to war, creating large 'God Beasts' that fought and brought on the Seven Days of Fire (Miyazaki's analogy for nuclear war). After the seven days, everything was destroyed, and out of the ashes a toxic forest arose, full of vile bugs that destroy everything living in their path. Nausicaa is special, and feels she can communicate with the bugs, especially the Ohmu, a giant caterpillar that is generally kind and gentle, but when provoked becomes a raging beast. The valley is on the fringe of the toxic forest, and her people have come to coexist near the forest, even as it poisons them. The king, Nausicaa's father, has succumb to the sickness. Soon, Torumekian soldiers come to their valley, hiding a secret from a warring state called Pejite. With this secret, comes bugs and poison seeping into the valley...<br /><br />This story is so in depth, yet it's about a fourth of the books. I suggest to anyone who likes this movie, or wants something to write about in an enviromental studies class, get them. All four Perfect editions. As for the movie, the same great art is preserved well in the dvd transfer. Obviously, for an '84 animation this one could be pretty bad, but disney gave a little retouch it would seem, or Studio Ghibli (miyazaki's design house) was just this good. Colors are vibrant, lines are sharp, little fuzz. The sound is crisp, in both languages, and the music is a sweeping score (great in surround sound).<br /><br />The reason this disc gets a star taken away, is special features. Disney did this and two others at the same time, (The Cat Returns, Porco Rosso, and Nausicaa) and they mostly have similar features.<br /><br />On the movie disc is a featurette called Behind the Microphone, featuring the english voise talent from the film discussing their experience and being all excited. This is nice, considering the all-star talent (Mark Hamill, Patrick Stewart, Shia Lebouf, Alison Lohman, Edward James Olmos, and Uma Thurman [almost another star taken away for her]). Next is a great featurette called \\"Birth of Studio Ghibli\\", told from producer Isao Takahata's perspective. This guy has been Miyazaki's main man since the beginning, and influential in Ghibli's success. Four japanese trailers, one english, and other Ghibli movie trailers are nicely implemented. The second disc is, again (same as all new two disc disney editions), entirely storyboards set to the audio tracks. Interesting for up-and-coming artists, enthusiasts, and comic fans. Otherwise, you'll probably pop it in for a few minutes, then turn it off. This is where the extra star went. I was expecting something special from this new version, and on two discs, I'm sure there were more features they could have translated...<br /><br />Overall, one of the great Miyazaki films.

B000002G7E|5.0|Honestly, that title is the best way to describe White Light/White Heat. This is the Velvet Underground's definitive album. Maybe it isn't their best (that title might go to their debut - The Velvet Underground and Nico), but it's the album that most reveals the heart and soul of the group. Accordingly, it's the rawest album they recorded, as well as the most difficult to listen to. Now, I often say that an album is hard to listen to, but White Light/White Heat is in its own league.     \\"White Light/White Heat\\" is a classic song - the music is about as chaotic as one could expect, the lyrics are a series of frighteningly enthusiastic endorsements of amphetamines, and the closing section is a noisy, stuttering, arrhythmic mess. Classic Velvet Underground.    \\"The Gift\\" is a spoken word piece. A very darkly humorous Lou Reed story is read by John Cale in the left channel, while a raunchy instrumental is played by the band in the right. The music is excellent and grinding, and John Cale's Welsh accent is distinctive and lends a sense of drama to the proceedings. By the way, it has to be listened to the whole way through at least once - the twist ending is classic.     \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is a darkly beautiful song that has some truly frightening lyrics set against an excellent melody. Those lyrics seem to be about an operation gone awry - how Lady Godiva fits into this scene remains a mystery - but the best touch is the way Reed and Cale trade off lines in opposite speakers.    \\"Here She Comes Now\\" is the most \\"mainstream\\" of White Light/White Heat's songs, but even that's an overstatement. Brief but effective, this is by far the easiest thing to listen to on the album.    \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" is mostly a showcase for Lou Reed's fractured, nervy guitar lines, influenced by Reed's self-professed love of jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor. His guitar work is stunning in its startling use of feedback, distortion, and complete lack of melody.     Even more surprising is the fact that \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" is not the most shocking moment on White Light/White Heat.    No, that title must go to \\"Sister Ray,\\" a seventeen minute plus jam that reveals the Velvet Underground at their most primal. Over half of the song is reckless, ugly improvisation, and everything else is filled with Reed's discomforting lyrics (during the most outrageous part, he sings the ambiguous \\"No man I haven't got the time-time/Too busy sucking on a ding-dong\\"). The solos (and there are a lot of them) are atonal, chaotic, and exhilarating, nearly slamming one another out of the picture. Every bandmember is trying to drown the others out, and when it finally comes together for a final blast of noise, you realize your heart is pounding in the sudden silence. Of course, you'll hate the song upon your first listen - it's very long. I only listen to \\"Sister Ray\\" occasionally, but I'm always struck by the sheer brilliance of this legendary recording.    Again, it's a notoriously difficult album, filled with left turns, atonal screeches, and dark lyrics. Upon your first listen, you'll hate yourself for buying White Light/White Heat, but if you can find a way to like the album (and it takes a while), you'll find all at once that it is one of the greatest rock recordings ever, bar none.
B0000262QW|3.0|I enjoy hard bop rather than fusion, but I was really hoping to like this CD.  The result was actually somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br />The first cut, Return To Forever, is actually five separate mini-mini-movements.  The first, about 1:11 long, is slow, in a minor key, and vaguely foreboding...not my thing, but it works.  In this segment, Flora used her voice as an instrument, which turned out OK.  The next segment was about 4:30, more up tempo, probably the best of the five IMHO.  This was followed by the same melody as in the first minute with slight variations.  The next, about 5:00 long, was again more up tempo, and had a long trio (Chick, Stanley, Airto) which worked pretty well.  However, in parts of this segment Flora changed to what I can best describe as a gutteral wa-wa, followed by subdued screaming.  This was the only place where I thought she detracted from the CD, and I can only wonder why.  The final movement was a reprise of the opening melody. <br /> <br />Not my cup of tea overall. <br /> <br />The next, Crystal Silence, was relatively slow.  Joe Farrell did some good soft sax work - overtones of Paul Desmond in a peaceful piece.  Perhaps the best cut in the CD. <br /> <br />I can only describe What Game Shall We Play Today as annoyingly cheerful.  Yes, I am a curmudgeon. <br /> <br />Sometime Ago also worked well, with vocals as bookends to some longish jams.  Stanley Clarke was on upright bass for this, wish it had gone on longer. <br /> <br />For some reason Sometime Ago was placed as one 23:18 cut with La Fiesta immediately following at the 15:26 mark.  I always find this irksome, but it was especially so for La Fiesta, which is the cut I enjoyed the most.  On the negative side, I am afraid I like the version with Stan Getz and Tony Williams (drums) recorded earlier in 1972 better. <br /> <br />One observation - the electric piano seems to have more volume than the other instruments - I found that adjusting the balance to favor the rightspeaker gave a better sound. <br /> <br />So...overall not to my tastes, but clearly a prominent album in the fusion pantheon.  Three stars.
B000AL730O|5.0|Chaos and Creation in the Back yard is a moving and complex selection of songs. I have read a number of reviews and the consistent theme is that you need to listen to this album a number of times before its grandeur starts to emerge. I agree with this. I think the lyrics are the best he has written. These are the lyrics of a man who has a genuine care for the world and the people in it. <br /> <br />You know I have always been a great admirer of Paul McCartney, for his courage and commitment to his work and not compromising. The music industry and its critics can be vicious and Sir Paul had endured more than his fair share of flack. <br /> <br />The fact is that Sir has maintained a consistently superior level of creativity and sophistication with his work for more than 40 years. He is constantly reinventing himself. <br /> <br />Thanks God for Paul McCartney <br />
B00000J7I3|5.0|Motley Crue's \\"Too Fast for Love\\" (1982) is one of the band's finest albums, as well as one of their most overlooked. Originally released independently in 1981, the album was remixed and released the following year on Elektra Records. Although the Crue wouldn't break through and hit it big until the following year with their landmark \\"Shout at the Devil,\\" (1983) \\"Too Fast for Love\\" remains a cult/fan favorite.<br /><br />\\"Too Fast for Love\\" does and does not have the Crue's sound that most people are familiar with. \\"Too Fast for Love,\\" although quite pop sounding at times, does not sound like a pop-metal album, the way their other 80s albums do. While it certainly has the classic Motley Crue sound and feel; these songs sound rawer, more punkish, than the bands later work. Overall it is the band's least commercial, least polished album. Comparatively speaking, \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is like a diamond in the rough.<br /><br />While \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989) is a great album, no doubt, the songs are sophomoric and tailor-made for MTV. Although \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is a definitive album from that era, it's somewhat contrived. \\"Too Fast for Love,\\" in contrast, sounds far more dangerous, genuine, and lived in. When the band recorded \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" they were complacent multi-millionaires and on top of the rock world. When the band recorded \\"Too Fast for Love\\" they were struggling and hungry. The songs on \\"Too Fast for Love\\" reflect that.<br /><br />While most Motley Crue albums have four or five very strong songs, with the rest being good, but not great, every song on \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is memorable and well written. As the clich&eacute; goes, it's all killer and no filler. Calling \\"Too Fast for Love\\" a pure \\"punk\\" album in the truest sense of the word wouldn't exactly be accurate. But there is definitely an element of punk to the album. It's probably most comparable to Generation X or Billy Idol's early solo albums. In other words, it's not hard-core punk, but assessable punk, with a fair amount of pop-content.<br /><br />On thing that immediately strikes the listener is how young and hungry the band sounds. Motley Crue never sounded as good as they did on their classic debut. They really sound like their ready to take on the world.<br /><br />These are Nikki Sixx's best penned songs. Although always a gifted songwriter, on subsequent albums he would at times try too hard, or try to embrace a trend. There is nothing contrived or pretentious about \\"Too Fast for Love.\\" The songs are genuinely dangerous and come straight from the heart.<br /><br />Vince Neil sounds fully fearsome, an indisputable street punk. Mick Mar's playing is top-notch and gives all the songs a real vitality. Tommy Lee's solid pounding is stellar as always, even when he was just a kid.<br /><br />\\"Live Wire\\" is probably the most well-known song on this disc. Fast and furious with a great hook, it's a good way to start off the album. The up-tempo \\"Come on and Dance\\" is one of the album's more popish songs and keeps up the momentum. \\"Public Enemy #1\\" is one of the Crue's most underappreciated songs. Fast and highly melodic, it's an anthem that epitomizes youth and rebellion. The album slows down a bit for the bleak \\"Merry-Go-Round.\\" Young and poor at the time, when Vince Neil asks \\"am I going down?\\" he meant it, which makes the songs sound all the more real. \\"Take me to the Top\\" and the Motley staple \\"Piece of your Action\\" are fast paced and infectious. The strength in the former is its melody, and the strength in the latter is its fierceness. \\"Starry Eyes\\" has an almost hypnotic intro and a haunting chorus. The album's title track \\"Too Fast for Love\\" is another anthem, akin to Skid Row's \\"Youth Gone Wild,\\" which was recorded almost a full decade later. The grand finale, mini-epic, tragic \\"On with the Show\\" is a perfect way to conclude the album.<br /><br />I really don't have any bones to pick with \\"Too Fast for Love.\\" From start to finish, the songs are all superb. Althoughnot as well known as some of the bands later work, it surpasses much of it. \\"Too Fast For Love\\" stands besides \\"Shout at the Devil,\\" and \\"Motley Crue\\" (1994), as the band's edgiest, most genuine, rocking music.<br /><br />The reissue of \\"Too Fast for Love\\" has many bonus songs that should be of interest to fans. The upbeat \\"Toast of the Town\\" and the popish \\"Tonight\\" are up-to-par with the rest of the album's songs. It's great that they have finally seen the light of day. The mid-tempo \\"Stick to your Guns\\" is good, but not quite as strong as the other tracks. \\"Too Fast For Love\\" with the alternative intro is cool, and is a nice bonus.superb.

0312330529|4.0|Despite thoroughly enjoying this novel, and immediately wishing it to continue despite its already absurd length, I recognize that it is not a perfect book. <br />To get the negatives out of the way, <br />Shantaram is overly long; although it seldom drags, certain sections seem unnecessary and implausible.  It quickly becomes apparent as to why this is fiction and not autobiographical. <br />The author uses excessively flowery language, at times it seems as though you are reading mediocre poetry instead of a novel.  His use of language will undoubtedly turn away a number of would be readers and at time it hinders the pace of the story.  <br />The characters are \\"larger than life.\\" This is both a pro and a con. While I cannot picture myself coming across any one of them on the street, the characters are entertaining.  And despite their implausibility they have a certain amount of charm to them that enables the reader to overlook this drawback. <br />Faults aside Shantaram is still well worth the time it takes to make your way through the numerous pages.  When the author is not being overly wordy, his writing is humorous and memorable.  He is able to take the reader through a wide range of emotions and experiences.   <br />What is undoubtedly the highest point of this book is the author's ability to transport the reader into a foreign land.  He is writing about a country, and city, that he knows and loves and it is his ability to convey this that makes Shantaram such an enjoyable read. <br /> <br />
B00000JG4N|4.0|After going on cruse control for most of the decade, Motley Crue pulled it together for what many would consider to be their masterpiece \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" (1989).<br /><br />Newly clean and focused, for their fifth album, the band tapped Bob Rock (Metallica) to produce their new CD.<br /><br />To many, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is regarded as the bands finest hour--their crown jewel. And While `Dr. Feelgood\\" certainly has many strengths; it suffers a few drawbacks as well.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is probably the band's best work since \\"Shout at the Devil.\\" The band--Vince Neil (vocals), Tommy Lee (drums), Nikki Sixx (Bass) and Mick Mars (Guitar), gave a one hundred percent effort. Unlike the past few records, the band didn't just coast. Their performance and Nikki Sixx's songwriting was top notch.<br /><br />Nikki Sixx penned a great collection of songs, so when the CD is good, it's very good. There is far less filler on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" then their had been on the Crue's last two albums, \\"Theatre of Pain\\" (1985) and \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" (1987).<br /><br />Some of the band's best work is on \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" like the arena-rock anthems \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" \\"Kickstart My Heart,\\" \\"Same ol' Situation,\\" and \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away).\\" The album's power ballads \\"Without You\\" and \\"Time for Change\\" are far more effective and memorable than many of the ballads from the Crue's peers during that era. Even the \\"filler\\" songs, (\\"Slice of Your Pie,\\" \\"Rattlesnake Shake, \\"Sticky Sweet,\\" \\"She Goes Down\\") between the big singles are effective and keep up the album's momentum. All in all, it's a thoroughly rocking and memorable album.<br /><br />The album does leave a little to be desired. Even if it is Motley Crue, some of the lyrics, especially \\"She Goes Down\\" are pretty dated and cheesy. And although \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" contains the band's catchiest collection of songs, the album isn't nearly as edgy or dangerous as the classics \\"Too Fast For Love\\" (1981) and \\"Shout at the Devil\\" (1983). Be that as it may, \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is still one of the best albums from the late `80s pop-metal genre and is sure to please most fans.<br /><br />The bonus material is cool to hear, as it shows the songs in progress.

I don't mean this disapprovingly, but rather just stating a fact.<br /><br />Hole's music reflected the change. Abandoning the grunge/alternative sound in favor of a glossy, popish one, Hole released their third album \\"Celebrity Skin\\" in the fall of 1998.<br /><br />Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) joined Love and guitarist Erick Erldandson in creating the new album (Erldandson later revealed that he disapproved of Corgan's involvement).<br /><br />Compared to Hole's first two albums \\"Pretty on the Inside\\" (1991) and \\"Live through This\\" (1994), \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is far more radio-friendly, with a far glossier production. Be that as it may \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is hardly an upbeat, cheerful album. Indeed, beyond the sunny exterior lies a distinctly dark album. Many of the album's songs were written about the death of Kurt Cobain. The sharp contrast between the album's dark tones and it's sunny, glossy exterior, makes for an intriguing listen.<br /><br />While not everything works, most of the album is quite strong. The Def Leppard-like title track gets the CD off to a good start. \\"Awful\\" and \\"Hit so Hard\\" are quite melodic and tuneful. The radio-staple \\"Malibu\\" (written about Cobain's last stint at a rehabilitation center there) is one of the best singles from the late 90s. The edgy \\"Reason's to be Beautiful\\" and \\"Use Once and Destroy\\" don't quite work. They would have sounded great stripped down and raw, but don't really mesh with the glossy production. \\"Dying,\\" works because of its sincerity, but is too popish for its own good. The downbeat \\"Northern Star\\" and the Go-Go's sounding \\"Boys on the Radio\\" are great. The latter very underrated. The lush \\"Heaven Tonight\\" is effective and keeps up the momentum. \\"Playing your Song\\" is one of the more aggressive songs on the album that actually works. The very bleak \\"Petals\\" makes for a good closing number.<br /><br />It would have been easy for Hole to have written a \\"Live though this\\" part II, but instead the band chose to take a chance and go in a different direction. While \\"Celebrity Skin\\" does have its flaws, most of the songs work. If you bought \\"Celebrity Skin\\" back in 1998 and were disappointed, try giving it another spin, without trying to compare it \\"Live though this.\\" You may be pleasantly surprised.bleak \\"Petals\\" makes for a good closing number.

B000002JR8|1.0|..that the guitarist from VoiVod recently passed away, who had about 1,000,000,000 times the talent that Dime ever had. No one says anything about Dennis's legacy w/ VoiVod, but this Dimef@g Darrle douche is still being praised by countless people who have no idea what real guitarist are. That goes to show you that popularity doesn't nessariliy = talent. <br /> <br />The Pantera hater guy has a point w/ all of his hate, Dimef@G was overrated, and Pantera was indeed a average band at best. They became popular way to late to have any real influence on metal in general. By the mid 90s, Pantera's heyday, NO ONE even cared about heavy metal, much less Pantera, people were listening too much better bands like AIC and Helmet. It is only recently with that they become popular now because the Nu Metal kidz grew out of the Korns and Slipnkots, and need something slightly harder. <br /> <br />Dimebag was never a good guitar player, get over it! Stop crying like little f@ggots over his death. Chriss Oliva is a fallen guitarist who should really be worshipped and not this f$%king idiot from texas who was a Billy Gibbons ripp-off (bet you Nu metal kidz don't even know who he is, ha ha ha). <br /> <br />You never hear anything about legends like Chriss Oliva from Savatage or VoiVod's or Armored Saint's dead guitarist, who actually had talent. No, we get dimef@G, one of the stupidest gimmicks in metal.
B000002OX7|5.0|Those of you who think that a band with the initials L.B. are better than the Who are, well, idiots. I can't even bring myself to mention their name in the same sentence as the Who. L.B. are a band that is totally reliant on production rather than actual musicanship and songwriting. The only contribution that they've made to culture are a bunch of stupid catch phrases as well as being the inspiration for middle class white gangstas to wear backwards baseball caps.
