0446580848|5.0|Waiting for a new Nelson DeMille novel has its ups and downs. It takes him about two years to get a new one out, so the time in between involves checking out the work of a bunch of other authors. That is by no means a bad thing, but no other thriller author to my way of thinking has a character as interesting to me as is John Corey, who has been featured in six previous novels, beginning with Plum Island in 1997 (one of them, however, The Book Case, is essentially a short story available on Kindle). DeMille has crafted a character full of non-stop sarcasm, which at times makes me laugh out loud. In The Panther, Corey is after the al Qaeda operative who planned the attack on the USS Cole in the Gulf of Aden. Along on the chase is Corey's wife, Kate Mansfield, whose principal function seems to be to illustrate how the Yemeni men treat women. Both of them work on the Anti-Terrorist Task Force, one of the many such groups set up after 9/11. Most of the action in this novel takes place in Yemen, not exactly a garden spot of the world, but a place where some of the al Qaeda bad boys hang out. As expected, Corey is not encumbered with much of a concern for political correctness, so his observations and commentary about the geography, government, and culture of the tiny nation at the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula are not likely to warm the heart of the average Muslim person. It seems as though to John Corey, Arab is a four-letter word. Actually, however, none of what Corey encounters in this long novel is spared his acerbic wit, ranging from his dealings with his supervisor at 26 Federal Plaza in New York, through those with the US diplomatic personnel in Yemen, to those with the bad guy and semi-bad guy Muslims he encounters as the plot unfolds. Readers whose sensitivities are not too finely-tuned will probably find his description of an excrement shaft and its use in the plot of some interest. What does one do, after all, with human waste when there is not much water around? I already know one answer to that question as a result of growing up in the 40s and spending time on my grandmother's farm in central Illinois. Of interest also to DeMille fans is that he involves in the plot another well-known character, Paul Brenner, featured in The General's Daughter and Up Country. The former title probably rings more of a bell than those of most of DeMille's novels, given that the book was turned into a reasonably good film of the same name that starred John Travolta as Brenner. I really enjoyed The Panther and would like to recommend it heartily to aficionados of the thriller genre and to DeMille's fans. The only problem I had with it is that the climax involves the use of the tired dramatic device of the bad guy who would rather talk than dispatch the hero. Oh well, after all, what's a novelist to do to bring over 600 pages of narrative to a close?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The first half of the book talks about aspects of SEAL training and previous missions, which was a nice lead up to the main mission everyone wants to read.  Filled with detail that gave a solider's point of view of that mission.  Very enlightening.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am not a big reader but this keeps your interest. Can not believe how fast I am getting through the chapters.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I had no idea this book would be about and provide a glimpse into the mind of an innocent young woman tempted by evil. The evil came in attractive packaging, and came with benefits, and it kept me wondering what her final decisions would be. I have no desire to read other books of this type... but it did seem to shine a little light on the hearts draw toward evil, and what some are willing to accept in pursuit of love and things.
0140067477|5.0|Great condition. Amazing and cute book. Great gift idea for any person. Easy read that makes many good valid points.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|From what I have heard about &#34;The Shield&#34; I expected so much more.  It was only alright.  I felt very disappointed after watching.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|After seeing the flim, we had to hear the music again -- and again -- so getting the sound track album was the best solution.  Great to have on a long drive or to wake up the house on a slow day!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Great story with good characters.  I read a lot of fantasy and this is one of the better reads.  I was very disappointed when I realized that this is the only book of the series out.  Can't wait for book two.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|This is a great movie. My kids love it, but it's also fun for adults. It arrived quickly and new, as described.
B00288KNJU|5.0|It's really a great movie for my daughter she's secretly obessed with it. And te 3D makes it even better for her.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This was terrible because all of the words in English are in here. Who likes that? Surely, I don't. Terrible
1419705849|3.0|Some of Jeff Kinney's material has been astoundingly good, and inspiring to people of all ages.  Frankly, that's what we all need more of!  I would say this latest book in the Wimpy Kid series lacks the maturity that others display. Is the author running out of good material?  Young people are endlessly fascinating, and face seemingly endless challenges as they develop in this complex and intense 21st century world, so I'm sure Mr. Kinney will continue to find new themes, and I look forward to his returning to blue chip quality control in his next offering.
B0087ZG7FC|1.0|This DVD did not work at all on two different blu rays. When I went to exchange it was out of stock.
0374275637|5.0|This is a fascinating and well-written read about important research that affects us all both individually and collectively. I had expected to like the book, but I actually liked it even more than I expected to. In fact, I plan to make it required reading for one of the courses I am teaching next year.<br /><br />As a side note, Daniel Kahneman is obviously an \\"it person\\" in this field having won countless awards including the Nobel Prize in Economics and the American Psychological Association Life Time Achievement Award. His work with Amos Tversky in particular has had enormous influence on scholars and policy markers across disciplines. I was lucky enough to both take a course from Kahneman as a doctoral student at U.C. Berkeley and to be in the audience for his acceptance speech for the APA Life Time Achievement Award. In both cases, I was struck not only by his tremendous insightfulness, but by the fact that someone who has accomplished so very much in his field could remain utterly devoid of even a morsel of arrogance.  This was true before all the awards, and it is has remained true after all the awards. Of course, you should buy the book because it is excellent, but it can't hurt to know that the author is not only a ground-breaking researcher and an excellent writer, but also a nice guy.  ; )<br /><br />In short, this is an engaging and impactful book written by a brilliant researcher who has influenced many scholars in economics, management, marketing and psychology. It is well written and relevant to anyone interested in better understanding human behavior.<br /><br />Happy reading!

B009O2XY12|1.0|fun at the beginning. and I love the cat that throws the bubbles but it keeps asking for money to keep playing. also it wont let me pass the first level. not a very fun game. besides like everyone said before who wants to pay money just to keep playing?!?! do not download!!!!!!!
1451695195|3.0|I had seen Oprah's interview with the author on OWN and felt like the book would be interesting and it was.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is not a show for people who are easily offended or have moral issues with controversial subjects. If that is you I would avoid it. If you aren't then this is a great, well-acted, always engaging hour of adult drama. There is so much crap out there on TV that this stands out. I can't wait to see the rest of the season.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|99 cents?! I couldn't believe it! If I could give this book 6 stars, I would. I read it in one day and could not put it down. The writing is fluid and unforced. The characters are believable. And, as a hard science fiction fan, I found the science completely satisfying. It's a first person story of a man stranded on Mars and what he does to cope with his predicament. Loved it. Loved the style. I hope there is some more stuff from this author!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It was a really cool book to read. liked how it was telling the stories of different people around the world
B00280LYIC|4.0|This was one of those books that I saw the movie first and wanted to compare it to the book. The book and the movie were both great on their own although the movie did take a lot of liberties.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|My youngest daughter (19) enjoyed this as a Christmas gift, she had been wanting it for a long time to add to her collection.
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|The app itself worked fine, but it is a trojan horse for sneaking ads into your phone. You get several ad messages a day. I got rid of it as fast as I found out.
B00009RGBS|5.0|My daughter had learned the hard way about loaning movies to friends, she loaned Chicago to a friend 3 years ago and never got it back. Needless to say she was pleased to get a replacement.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Have you ever watched a movie that went on and on and you knew less at the end than you did at the begining?  This movie seems like a serial movie where there is no end to any of the segments.  Of course if you just want special effects and lots of gun fire this won't diappoint you.  If you just want to see a girl in a lether suit fighting her way through scene after sce34ne only to end up with a very vague ending this is your movie.  A little ceative writing of the storyline would have helped.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a fun but creative game that allows you to build but also to destroy things. when you look around you can find new things to build with
B009HEMJCW|4.0|Fun, light-hearted, yet has a great moral to the story. A fun, clean film that the whole family can enjoy.
B00884GR0W|5.0|block story is similar to minecraft but with so many more things to do like make cars,guns,swords,etc I would tell people to get this app if they want to.
0307744434|5.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning...\\"<br />In this book Erin Morgenstern provides the one thing you truly want in a good book- an escape from reality. I read this book when it was first released and have found myself re-reading it and recommending it to friends and family ad-nauseum. Not one person who I have successfully convinced to read it has given negative feedback. The brief intervals in which the author escorts 'you' through the circus itself I found draw you further into the world, giving you your own chance to 'break the fourth wall' so to speak. The imagery is captivating and the characters range from endearing to mysterious. I would love to attend a midnight dinner or stroll through the Ice Garden. I've been told it's obvious when I am reading this book because I have a secret smile plastered on my face whenever I'm in the world of Le Cirque du Reves. I hope her next book is as good and anxiously await its release.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great love story that pulls your heartstrings for Katie. You can feel her innocence, compassion and fear rolled into one as she bravely escapes her silent hell and makes a new life for herself.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It shed light on the personal considerations in man/woman relationships which could help avoid many years of toubled times in the future.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I was expecting more information about Bin Laden, his family, customs, the way they lived and how they really knew where he was.  To me, the book is a complete manual of how to become a Navy Seal and that was of no interest to me.  Nevertheless I read it to the end.
B0041D843M|5.0|Eye opening for insight into medical care people.  All doctors should be taught ab out its findings in med school.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I chose this ranking because the book really deserves it.  Ken Follett is a marvelous writer and surely anything written by him will always be ranked as the best.
B004Y12S9W|5.0|Great for delivering HD quality from your Apple device unto your HD television.  Must have if you have an iPad or iPod.

B009H442DG|4.0|I thought it was great that Olivia Newton - John and John Travolta got together again to sign. Long overdue!
B009CGGCSC|5.0|We both love this movie and have watched it several times. Meryl Streep is fantastic as are all the other actors. The musice is fantastic and how the story line is made around the lyrics in the music. One of our most favorite movies ever.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and I continually hear about how much he likes it. He's very picky and just flat out won't wear something if he doesn't like it, however he has this watch on everyday. Great gift and price!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Bought this amp to use with my ATH-m50's and I love it. I have been using it for about a month now and just couldn't be happier with it's performance ( in comparison to the price )
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This trilogy is by no means great literature but like the Twilight Series you just want to read it. Book one....quick read, not great. Book two....much better, more enjoyable and book three didn't pick up the momentum of book two but how can you not read the conclusion.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|my son loves it. Its a very nice Lego lord of the rings set. Perfect for the kid in you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book has some surprises that I didn't see coming while reading it.  Couldn't put it down wanted to see how it ended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is all that you've heard about and probably more. At the beginning and throughout it is very erotic but once you get into the 3 books you truly see the love that these 2 people have to for each other.
0062213423|5.0|This was a gift for my teenage grand daughter, who loves anything about these guys.  Her bedroom walls are like a huge tribute to them all - she loved the book.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of Nicholas Sparks' best books!!  It was just a love story.  It kept things moving from beginnng to end.  It brought you into the life and struggles of someone stuck in an abusive relationship.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great having on my kindle as I still have a very old cell phone and am unable to access facebook on it. This way I can still keep up with my family and friends events.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved reading this book! I would recommend it to anybody! I started reading it on Friday and was done by Sunday morning. I couldn't stop myself. It is a beautiful love story with sadness, courage, and real issues.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I remember playing this as a child and have always loved it. I just haven't figured out how to get out of the app after having no more moves and not wanting to play another deal or replay the same deal. There is no exit game completely.
B007HO392S|5.0|She is truly becoming a SUPER STAR.  Another American Ideal winner gone good!  And she is so good looking and down to earth too.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Got it for my grandson who is 8 years old. It just didn't seem to hold his interest. He is more into the race car and dirt bike racing games. I remember playing it on my atari when I was just a kid, but I even find it boring at this stage in my life.
B009NPA3MS|3.0|Gave it 3 stars because my wife really likes his music.  His song from American Ideal is good.  Other songs on CD are so-so in my opinion.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|A non-creepy Steven King book with a fabulous story--so much more involved than just JFK's assasination! And the time travel actually feels believable!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I saw this movie twice; once with a friend and again with my husband.  I always say that Hawaii was one of that characters in the story and that includes the music.  Sitting in the theatre, I was immediately transported to the islands by the beautiful sound of the music.  If you like hawaiian music, buy this CD.  You will not be disappointed.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Wow, this thing is SOLID. This knife is like a crowbar with a razor sharp edge. The knife will literally shave the hair off my arm right out of the box. I researched knives for almost two weeks before I finally decided to buy the Kabar/Becker BK2. I had my choices narrowed down between the Fallkniven A1 (cost too much), ESEE-4 (equal to the BK, but cost more), Becker BK7, or BK2. The only thing negative that people were saying about the BK2 was the handle material and the large size of the knife. But, this knife feels great in my (large sized) hand, it's well balanced and a good hefty weight. The sheath that comes with the knife is equally as good. It provides almost unlimited tie down options. The only thing that needs improving about the sheath is the belt loop; it's too large of a loop. But, the loop could easily be resized (a quick run through a sewing machine) to someone's particular belt size.<br />This knife is pure MADE IN AMERICA quality.
030759565X|4.0|Bought this for my wife as a xmas present and she likes it a lot. I'm looking forward to the results!
0307887448|5.0|Well paced romp through an 80's tinted version of Snow Crash, with pop culture references that reward a generation wasted in front of movies, games, and television. Highly recommended, especially as a breather between two more complex novels.
0345522478|4.0|I got this book based on the recommendations of Amazon reviews. I got it because of my love of Irish culture and I love to read urban fantasy books. I was pleasantly surprised by it. The writing is good, although some of the author's attempts to make a 21 century old druid modern kind of made me stop in the flow of the book. Being someone who is exploring options of religion and is open to all religion, I found it (Slight spoiler) kind of cool that the author brings into this world all religions, talking about Thor, Jesus, Mary, old Celtic gods, among others.<br /><br />The plot twists were somewhat unexpected at the end, with who the big bad was teamed up with, but otherwise it was a semi-predictable book. A good fun series that I hope to read the rest of!<br /><br />4/5 stars due to me being extremely picky with my books. Overall, it was very good.
B0090OW7J4|5.0|Pleasant surprise. First heard John Hiatt on Joe Bonamassa's album (Live from New York Beacon theater). Wasn't too impressed, but curiosity got the best of me and I listened to the previews of his new album on amazon. I liked what I heard, and I bought the album. The music is laid back bluesy. No heavy riffs or hard rocking blues, but nice arrangements that'll have you stompin' your foot to the beat &#34;My Business&#34;, or just daydreaming to songs like &#34;No Wicked Grin&#34;. Every song sounds great. Really nice work.

I don't know of any flaws and you can do all kinds of neat editing! my favorite thing to do is change eye color. it just takes time to get used to and know where everything is ,but once you hey the hang of it it's fun and easy to use. I would recommend this app and photo edit pro.
1451683405|2.0|Because naturalistic Darwinian evolution is theoretically false, Harris book on free will also be false. Your will is part of your soul which is non material in nature. The Universe demands a supernatural cause, God! Because God is spirit and we are created in His image, we do have a free will. What you do with that free will is up to you, you can spit God in His face or love Him, it's up to you. The fallen, sinful man produces fallen, sinful works that is not a reflection of God but of man's own fallen mind!<br /><br />I also think Dr William Lane Craig and Ravi Zacharias have answered all of Sam Harris's objections to the Christian worldview in their books. God has given us excellent Christian apologists who have answered all intellectual objections to the Christian truth claims that might hinder the individual from coming to Christ. Our sinful nature rejects God, that's why you have to crucify your sinful nature and come back to God and live your life for God which is your own free choice. Also the fallen mind of man rejects ultimate Truth claims from God, for the fallen nature is at enmity with the spirit of God and suppresses the Truth in unrighteousness. That is why it's unable to comprehend the Word of God, for it is `foolishness' to him. The only way to understand God is to get `Born Again' for the spirit is of a different dimension than the soul [the intellect].

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great. I would recommend this book to my friends. It is the best out of the seven.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book is like a fourteen years old girl's sexual fantasy, and written as such. The main character is a virgin and innocent college student, and then we have the extremely rich/extremely handson man who (surprise!), fells crazy in love for the girl, and a little bit of S&M to garnish the whole thing. Awful, I couldn't finish it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great graphics. Best game I've played so far.  Can't wait for the next one. It was suspenseful. I would recommend this game to my friends.

B005C0DHEY|4.0|This eye-opening documentary from a few years ago really explains the dangers about fracking and Natural Gas drilling in easy to understand terms. Well worth the view!
0812993292|4.0|At times as I listened to the Audible version of this book, I thought that it was just one big idiot plot.  As you may know, the \\"idiot plot\\" is a plot that continues only because the characters don't share information with each other that would resolve the key conflict.  Similarly, in this book, we have characters who have become estranged and unhappy because they have never talked to each other about painful events in the past.  Over the years, the wounds have scarred over, but not healed.<br /><br />Many times as I read, I was annoyed because it seemed so unbelievable to me that a husband and wife (even British) could live together for 20 years without any true communication, blaming each other for the events of the past but never doing anything about their unhappiness.  But I kept reading because Rachel Joyce is a good writer and I enjoy a quest story.  Gradually, I became attached to Harold and Maureen, flawed as they are, and I was intrigued to find out more about Queenie.<br /><br />The last chapters were affecting without being maudlin or clich&eacute;d.  Rachel Joyce made me think about the many times there have been things we don't talk about in our pasts and, even if they aren't as serious or wounding as in this book, they still hurt us and the people we care about.  We all have our own \\"idiot plots\\" in our lives.  As Queenie muses, life's a slippery bugger.  Maybe we should remember that and consider what we can do to heal those old wounds before we have to leave life behind.<br /><br />About the audiobook:  Jim Broadbent is a lovely narrator for this book.  You may know him as a longtime British movie actor who played Professor Horace Slughorn in some of the Harry Potter movies, Bridget Jones's father, Boss Tweed in Gangs of New York, John Bayley in Iris, Harold in Moulin Rouge, Gilbert (of Gilbert & Sullivan) in Topsy Turvy, and on and on.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Two for the price of one -- A-The directors cut 2hrs-36min.  B-The theatrical version 2hrs-21min.<br />Aside from the wonderful Mr. Crow, The movie has lots of action, love story and a twist on historical fact.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm a sucker for anything Sherlock Holmes.  This set of programs have the perfect set of complexity to them you'd expect in a Sherlock story.  The two actors do the parts justice.
B0071AKB38|4.0|easy to connect and the sound is great. Is light in weight and better shielding would be a nice feature.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Never reviewed a book until now. Buy this. Best story I've read in a while. Would love to meet the author. Bet he's a cool frickin guy!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|I found it a bit boring, and only got about haqlf way through....did not particularly care for the tid bits about his marital relationship.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I had read a book about getting things set up on the Kindle and it was recommended to download the Dolphin Browser so that I could download Adobe Flash Player to play videos.  However, after several attempts at downloading this browser to the Kindle I gave up because it just wouldn't open the file.  This browser may work great, but I was not able to find out with a Kindle.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Some of the greatest forms of literature come from the greatest authors who write their hearts to the stories that they tell. Tom Sawyer was a classic novel that was very well-written and had the makings of an epic story from start to finish. It was a joy to read and I cherished every phrase, every chapter and everything in between. I learned of the fantastic adventures that are a part of everybody's youth and of your life from Mark Twain' s, \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\\"
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|I thought this movie would be a little creepy for my son, but he loves it a lot. I recommend it!
1577314808|3.0|I wasn't expecting such a dry book. I had to force myself to keep reading, after a few chapters I gave up.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I was unaware that this book has been so controversial when it first came out...I just found it by happenstance.  I can't believe anybody would mistake this for anything other than what it was, one families journey of parenting.  My husband and I have two grown children, so I have been on this journey too.  I don't think that I could have been as honest about what went on in our household. Only hypocrites would be critical...and anyone that has never been a parent. It offers a different view of parenting, one I think we can learn from, warts and all. Thanks for an entertaining and insightful book.
1476712042|5.0|I finished this book in nearly 24 hours, I could barely put it down and anxiously waiting for the next book!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great adventure to India.  A wonderful story of retired people who travel from England to live in an old hotel in India.  The story line is well done, and the actors and actresses are perfect for their roles.  5-Stars for this movie.
B005X7HA6C|5.0|I have been an avid fan of Beat Takeshi for many years and appreciate his writing, editing, directing and mostly his acting.  Very natural but so real.  He won't win any academy awards but I don't care, I just go back and watch Sonatine and enjoy good movie making.
B0002BO05S|5.0|This actually is the greatest story ever told.  Very moving and a well done production of the life of Jesus Christ.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I click on and I don't get the messages that I would get if I was to go on the internet. Just not understanding as what to do.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun game with lots of replayability. I'm a huge fan of Pandemic 2, the flash game that this one emulates very closely. You can unlock items with real currency or you can unlock them through playing.
B001CDLAT4|4.0|Thank you for the speedy delivery.I initially thought I could not play the DVD but after purchasing a new player,the DVD is now playing.I didn't realise there were regional codes across different countries and was disappointed not to be able to view DVD at Christmas but problem is now resolved.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I liked the main plot.  I loved the way Carter...Connor (hahaha) was so determined in what he wanted..Megan. I read very fast so I only wished it was longer.  I will be reading another book by this author.
B000R8YC18|4.0|It was great no major  problems it did take a little longer  to get there than I thought it would..
B005LAII08|4.0|GOOD PRICE FOR A POPULAR MOVIE. ALTHOUGH  I DO WISH THAT DISNEY WOULD MAKE A BUNDLE WITH JUST A REGULAR DVD AND BLURAY IN IT. ITS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE ALL 5 DVDS, BUT IS THE ONLY WAY TO GET A BLURAY ONE.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I could not put it down it was so entertaining it was weird though but I loved it and it was free
B003DZX3SA|3.0|I AM TRYING TO GET A COLLECTION OF CLASSIC DISNEY MOVIES TOGETHER FOR MY GIRLS. I WANT BLURAY DVDS THOUGH AND THIS DVD IS NOT BLURAY. THE ADVERTISING ON TOP THAT DAYS 2-DISC GIVES THAT IMPRESSION. A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WAS NO BLURAY.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Thinking about the entire process of the most important thing is a great job. The first time I read the full story
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book started off strong; thus, I was tricked into buying it.  What a waste of time and money!  The plot is utterly predictable, up to the point that it should have ended.  It seemed like the author tried to then tack on a surprise ending; and another; and another!  Each chapter is more ridiculous.  The writing is corny, the characters clicheed, and worst of all, the plot seems to be a weaving of several different horrid real-life crimes.  I have no idea how this book got on to the best seller's list.
B004ZY0VHY|2.0|I found the format of letters to tell the story an unusual single perspective. The story itself is very bizarre. Even for a mystery reader this was difficult to finish. Initially, I kept asking myself where this story was going then when it went somewhere it was too disturbing to recommend.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|It is a wonderful adventure. It is great to explore other mysteries of the imagination. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys using their imagination for a getaway.
B00AI3OLI6|5.0|Buddy Guy's recent live album shows the 75 year old Bluesman has still got it -- great voice -- incredible guitar playing and super interaction with his audience.  His version of &#34;Skin Deep&#34; uses a Coral Electric Sitar to make up for not having Derek Trucks playing slide -- it is superior, IMO, to the studio version.  Overall it is a very good depiction of his live show -- In Boom Boom/Strange Brew he does his version of the great guitar styles of John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Hendrix, Claption etc., but the real winners here are the songs like &#34;Comin' for you&#34;  where we see Buddy at his frantic best.  If there is a compliant, it would be that it is only 6 songs.  Regardless, it is loaded with energy and is the real deal.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I downloaded this because I like strategy games that I have to think before I choose my next move.  It is definitely challenging.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've shown this game to three different coworkers and we are all hooked on it. Lunchtime, on the bus, waiting for the train, in waiting rooms - it's a great distraction. There are TONS of levels, and though the first ones are easy, they do get very challenging later.
B000W4KSWO|5.0|My dad played the sax and I always loved this album.  That is where my love for jazz comes from.  My first album was stolen now I have it again.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|To compare the book to the movie would be unfair. The book<br />has a style all its own. Told In a simplistic fashion, it reads as a childrens book. Quite imaginative in scope, it's a fun read.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|I bought this for wife so I can't comment sorry. I hate Anne Hathaway and her stupid fish slapped lips and big alien eyes. No way is that her real name either. I mean an actress in the 21st Century with the same name as Shakespeare's wife. No way.
B0098460O4|5.0|Mostly- I dont know what they are saying - it is just so beautiful - I have watched their original audition on BGT, Cowell got Susan Boyled again - both voices are awesome - his seems so full and rich for someone so young - they are just great together - absolutelu love, love this CD and have played it endlessly- highly recommend it - and whatever they do next will also purchase
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|I like using this feature,just not on me. My grandchildren really get into it.<br /> They love being in the front of a camera.<br />4 stars because it good but could be better.
B008Y1YK0I|1.0|Although other Blu Ray restorations have been wonderful, this one was really sub par -- both picture and sound. If you want a GREAT ONE try Ben Hur.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Pac Man coming back strong. a reversion of the old is better.<br />4 stars because I'm just getting into it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Always wonder what my dog is thinking. This book helped me understand how life may be for them. Recommend for pet lovers. be prepared to laugh and cry
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I gave it an okay 3 stars because I love it but my grandkids has to get use to it.
0316069434|5.0|The Black Box is another gripping Harry Bosch adventure complete with bumbling police officials and a real understanding of the real heroes on \\"the job.\\"<br />My only disappointment is that Michael Connelly writes so well that I breeze through his novels in record time. I finished The Black Box in a day. Now I will go back and savor it.
0765325950|5.0|I was nervous coming to the last book, as this was the last chance to tie all the loose ends together in the most epic sci-fi/fantasy book series ever written. Brandon Sanderson did a masterful job with Robert Jordan's masterwork. Just about every character, and story line is tied up in an engaging way, and a page-turner like I've rarely read. Without giving anything away, all I can say is this book is filled with suspense, heartbreaks, laughter, and joy as events spiral towards the last minutes of all creation, and the battle for Light, and Dark is finally joined at the Last Battle. If you are a fan of the series, I'm sure you're not going to be disappointed.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|G5 games are always entertaining and keep your attention till the end. the down side is they say free and none of them specify that you're getting the demo for free not the full game. on top of that they cost $5 each. i can get big fish games, that are just as good, and pay $3 or less instead and they specify in the description that you're playing a free demo first. i just don't think these games are worth spending $5 each on. unless you make enough money that it doesn't matter but for most people it does cause most people can't afford to be spending money like that.<br />either way thanx for the entertainment
B0099116AY|4.0|After ordering one &sending it back because I couldn't watch ,it and sent#2  back because I needed an update for my player I went out and bought the regular dvd.I was told by Memorex that they no longer made blue ray players????????
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Could not put it down.  A great read.  Every man who wants to please his lady should read this book!
B000FA675C|4.0|Good read. Lots of facts. I am a true believer. Leonardo Da Vinci. Was way ahead of his time. Awsom
1416511946|5.0|This book is great. The packaging was so secure and it came pretty quickly. I love it so much. Worth it.
B00A2AU0KI|4.0|A very kind of curl up on the couch movie. Really enjoyed it, and I highly recommend it for family viewing.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I had expected this to be a terrible movie but was told to try it anyway. I'm glad I did. It was actually a really good movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is addictive. Brilliantly cast and storyline is wonderful.<br />Watched the entire series in only 3 days.<br />Need to watch from series 1 episode 1 to understand the story & characters though.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is easy to learn but challenging as you progress through the stages. Great for all ages! I highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love love these books.<br />I was left wanting more.  Couldn't put it down. I don't read much but I loved these books.
B004GYY714|5.0|So far it's great. My choice of this over I-Heart Radio was influenced by other reviewers' comments because I don't like to have to sign in to things through Facebook.  I just wanted to be able to have radio station music on my Kindle Fire HD.  And, by the way, the Fire HD sound is impressive for a small tablet!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case fits the Kindle Fire HD 7\\" perfectly. It's well built and the Kindle snaps in securely. As far as the up side down or down side up issue, I would say that it's a decision to be made by the user. I bought the Kindle for my wife as a Christmas gift. I felt rather insecure using the device as is. I felt it needed some protection of some type. So I researched many cases and decided to take a chance with this model. When I snaped it into the case I chose to have to camera facing up from the noslip case cover side, which I believe is the \\"correct\\" way to install it. Unfortunately you can't charge the device with the case closed and this is why I only give a 4 star rating. In a perfect world there would have been a small appature in this side of the case to allow access to the charging & hdmi ports. My wife quickly flipped the Kindle around in the case because she wants the volume toggle on the left hand side. I've decided to keep the peace and have learned to use the Kindle in the \\"upside down\\" orientation! Of course the Kindle works perfectly whether the volume/power toggle is left or right. I use the Kindle for Skype calls so the camera up works best in this situation, you can rest the Kindle on the noslip cover base and use hands free. With camera down you would have to hold the Kindle at all times. All in all this is an excellent product at a very fair price and I highly recommend if looking for some level of protection for other than a nekkid Kindle.
1439152802|5.0|Got this as a gift for my Mom who has not read it yet.  But it was a book that she wanted so I am sure she is pleased.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game. Very easy to learn and very addictive. A very easy way to pass time. Also the game is free..
B007EECSFA|3.0|It was good.  Kept my interest, but didn't leave me with the &#34;oh, that was a fun read&#34; feeling at the end.
B0086700CM|2.0|Too tough for this old girl.  Even though I signal jumps and turns he program does not respond to commands timely
B008QDCZJ2|5.0|This review is for the 2CD Deluxe Edition of the new Pet Shop Boys album, \\"Elysium.\\"  I highly recommend this album to anyone that likes to listen to songs.  The album is so very stellar in terms of music and poetry.  I gotta admit straight outta the box, I was expecting to love this CD.  It didn't happen right away....lol.  I was at first disappointed.  I still think the \\"Ego Music\\" track belongs on a b-side covered in dust somewhere but, once the entire album grew on me....it is one of their best and that says a lot.  I remember listening to \\"Very\\" in 1993 thinking this band is totally at their peak.....um....20 years and countless albums later they are still as if not more brillant than ever.  So, onto the Deluxe Edition....CD1 is a gem in itself and just a pleasure to experience the entire album.  CD2 is simply the instrumental version.....I love Neil Tennats voice and lyrics so much though....I really don't spin this disc too often.  The music is stellar though and it is a wonderful listen.  These two discs and a booklet come in a box with plenty of room in it.  Being, the Pet Shop Boys just released a 2CD compilation of their later career B-sides.  I had to get the single releases (doubt they'll show up on a compilation anytime soon).  So interesting and recommended too....The Winner EP has a several must have B-Sides.....a favorite being \\"I Started a Joke\\" a nice cover of an early Bee Gee's song.  The Leaving EP too has a must have B-Side in the song \\"In His Imagination.\\"  Recently got the 2CD set of their new single \\"Memory of the Future.\\"  I love this song, it is one of the best ones on the album.  As far as the singles are concerned....\\"Listening\\" is the stand out B-Side and the Stuart Price remixes of \\"Memory of the Future\\" are okay but, I love the original version.  There is also a trance mix, dubstep/cumbia mix...lol....if that is your thing.  Dare I say it this album is very similar to \\"Behavior\\" and at times Neil Tennant reminded me of Leonard Cohen on the dance floor.....but, this dance floor is dripping with paranoia, tears, and the occasional bliss.  Yes, I think Neil Tennant is just as amazing as Leonard Cohen.  Bust out the \\"non helpful review\\" button....lol.  So, 4 Singles later...I filled up the Deluxe Box to act as a comprehesive box of PSP recent output.  If you have never ever heard any Pet Shop Boys....I would recommend their live album Pandemonium in addition.  Then, everything else they ever released.  I go on record on saying their weakest song is \\"West End Girls,\\" I usually go West of the West End when it is played on the radio or when these guys play on TV and that is the only song they are apparently allowed to play....lol.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Game is entertaining. Good game to fill idle time without being difficult to set aside when you need to or want to.
B009O2XY12|1.0|Very cute game and my family loves playing it but when you try to move to the next level, it asks for money. My son didn't understand why he couldn't play anymore. If it's not gonna be free than take it off the free game menu.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great book V Flynn is at the top of his game keep me into the book all the way to the last page
B001I8C7WM|5.0|Mobb Deep shows their classic dark sound on this album.  Havoc is at the top of his production game and Prodigy offers some of his best verses.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics and storyline.  Can't wait to play other games by this maker.  Good mini games and brain readers as well.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Barbara Streisand is one of the best singers ever. Everyone should own at least one CD by her. My favorite song on here was sung with Barry Gibb &#34;What Kind of Fool&#34;.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|Loved this book! I fully immersed myself in the characters and found myself rooting for them. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Delightful!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love dark stories with what others might consider (and have described in other reviews here as) unlikeable characters. I actually did like all of the characters; most of them had at least one redeeming quality that I could identify with, and those who didn't (Diondra, Runner and Trey) were still entertaining and were of course integral to the story.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending, but spoilers ahead:<br /><br />The story starts in the present with the main character, Libby, learning that she is almost out of money that she received over the years as a charity case due to being the only surviving member of the gruesome murder of the rest of her family by her oldest brother twenty five years earlier. Just in the nick of time, she is approached by a member of a group of people who are fans of murder cases, and don't believe it was her brother who did it, and are willing to pay her to investigate the truth. Most of the members of the group are initially hostile towards Libby, since they are sympathetic towards her brother and it was her testimony that put him in prison.<br /><br />Each chapter alternates between different characters in the past on the day of the murder, and present day Libby as she progresses in her investigation over the course of what must be several weeks. She is very flawed; sarcastic, not friendly, she steals inexpensive things for no real reason other than she wants to at the time... but she's somehow also honest and open to these experiences that she's been avoiding for so long. I enjoyed her voice.<br /><br />Others have stated that the coincidences that culminate in the novel's climax are hard to believe or accept; I disagree. It is fiction, so we can agree that it didn't really happen, but coincidences do indeed happen all the time and I can accept this ending with no problem. I think the author did a great job.<br /><br />This is in no way a &#34;feel good&#34; book. There is violence, and hate, and deadbeats, so if you really don't like that sort of thing, then this book isn't for you. However, it does have a very clear ending and the &#34;right thing&#34; happens (unlike the somewhat open endings of her other two books, which I also loved).<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is a talented writer, great descriptive language, believable dialogue, and a creative story-teller. I highly recommend this book.t like that sort of thing, then this book isn't for you.

B0001ARCFA|4.0|I bought these to replace a lost pair of Grados SR-80's.  After using them for most rock and EDM stuff, I'm a little underwhelmed by the sound.  You get to hear everything, but it doesn't particularly make your music sound better so to speak.  Besides that they're really comfortable.  I'm not an expert with this stuff, but I can't say this is the best sound for this price range.
B004222UCS|2.0|I bought the Seventh Star cd when it first came out.When I saw it reissued with Ray Gillen on it I ran for my credit card.Tony Martin is really talented but Ray is one in a million.He had incredible talent but his life ended before he had a chance to enjoy it fully.Back to Deluxe release.Sadly the live cd with Ray singing is beyond awful sound quality.If any knows where i can get rare recordings of Ray please post them!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|For any Austin Fan. Shows what any diehard fan would dream of a chance to meet and fall in love with Darcy.
B006LSZECO|5.0|really a great read!  Super character development, you won't regret buying this novel. Looking forward to more books from this author
B0084B5TK8|5.0|love ths book, even though all of the vampire you read about are differnt, I have read a few. This being one of the origial stories is still one of the better ones for me
B007SGM084|5.0|Love this book and the erotic tryst that Ana and Christian continue to explore.  I've read the books 4 times and each time I can't put them down.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I got this for myself to keep, but also so I could loan it to a family with two little girls who had never seen the animated Disney version.  Their mother told me they loved it so much that they watched it several times before returning it to me.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|The app itself is well laid out, and definitely interesting to use. The only drawback would be that it is more suited for fullsize tablets, and would be difficult to use and appreciate on a smaller phone screen.
0307887448|4.0|I had 'read' this as an audiobook from the library and enjoyed it immensely. It is not the typical Sci-Fi story, since it takes place in both the real world and the online gaming world, with consequences crossing over from one world to the other.  Although I am not familiar with a lot of the gaming jargon, not being a player myself, I know enough from watching my son play online, to understand most of the action and references.<br /><br />Since I had enjoyed it so much, I decided to get it as a gift for a nephew who is a 'gamer' and computer fan.<br /><br />Physically, the book, being a paperback, was a little 'smooshed' over to one side from being lovingly carried around to be read at will.  My opinion is that it may have been read by one person who then shared it with one or two friends.  However, it was still in good enough condition for yet another reader.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Both my husband and I enjoyed this book.  Great story line with gripping details that made us want to continue reading until the end.  I would highly recommend it.
B0083IU84Y|4.0|We are enjoying this in our family car at the moment.  A bit like a young Bob Dylan so that can't be bad.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Good fun and inspiring movie to watch witn kids.  We will watch it year after year. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL
1846467640|3.0|Got this as a stocking filler for our 3 year old peppa pig fan.  I had already read reviews that they were small so the size didn't surprize me.  They are cute and my daughter likes them.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is hilarious and both my kids loved it (13 and 15).  Very entertaining and the music is great.  Definitely recommend for a fun movie night.
B006O6F932|5.0|The Monster High High School Playset was a big hit at my house.  The set is colorful and has rooms known to fans of the web-series.  It folds down neatly for storage which is a plus.  The real surprise was how large the set is when opened.  While not as big as the old Barbie Dreamhouse, it is actually much more spacious than it appears on the picture.  Each area is large enough to play out scenes with the dolls comfortably.  The set also includes many additional pieces/accesories to use with the school.<br /><br />The educational value of this set is the same as with any other doll set which is that it allows for acting out social scenarios and interactions safely through play.  The durability of the product is fair, and depends on how it is played with.  The set is not flimsy, but it is not super sturdy either.  While I would not recommend it for a younger or careless child, an older child who is more careful with toys should have no issues with durability.<br /><br />The bottom line: The Monster High High School Playset is a great toy for older children who love the dolls.  The set is also a must have for Monster High collectors.  I would not recommend it for younger children who are not careful with their toys.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|This continuation of the Century of Giants trilogy is a big story covering many characters from different countries during the Second World War. They are all connected to each other in various ways. It is crammed with interesting facts and opinion about this awfull war. I can't find the third one, maybe it hasn't been written yet but I will be reading it when It turns up.
B000001ESN|5.0|With all the reviews, I have nothing to add, I just put it up so the \\"5\\" star rating would help on recommendations for myself.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you hooked from beginning to end. Leaves you with a cliffhanger in each chapter just like the first book. I will definitely read the third book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish there was a free version because I love minecraft and play it all the time on xbox 360 but I don't have any money so please make a free verzion
0740748475|5.0|This was one of my favorite Amazon purchases.  It was in perfect condition and my husband loves it.  Now our daughter has gone through all three volumes.  Great product and great seller.
0062202081|5.0|i always think a book by that specific person is always better than from someone else.  there's plenty of nice pics of him and his inner circle and his thoughts on his every-day life. so much goes on for him and it's nice to see what he thinks of his life and career.  if you wanna know more about him, this book [and his 1st book] is a great place to start!
1451695195|4.0|Great account of an extensive nde, by someone uniquely placed to discount all the reductionist 'explanations' trotted out to belittle and demean the experience and the insights gained. The structure of the narrative was a little irritating, cutting back and forth from his experience at his level, and the material goings-on at the everyday level, as well as hinting that he had a lot more information about what he experienced and remembered than what he was putting in to this book. Is there a sequel coming? I'm looking forward to it! A critical addition to the nde literature, that will stimulate some to question what they think they know, and that's great, especially those with the greatest shift to make - the doctors and scientists who are ready to make the shift and can contribute their skills to the great cause of human evolution. Blessings to him and his family for what they've gone through, to the benefit of all!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My seven year old begged me to get this game on myKindle.  My whole family loves to play to see you can get to the next level.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was funnier than the previews made it look.  Very adult based material, don't watch with young children.  Great movie!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My fourteen year old talked me into geting this game.  I do enjoy it but it does get frustrating on the upper levels when you are trying to figure out how to use 100% of the piples.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love love love love love love adicting to play fish I need to be provoced hi on was the time out on the side
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Superb acting, great special affects, great story line.Best movie that I have seen in long time. Truly a great sequence to Jason Bourne.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept my interested from the very beginning.  I never wanted to put it down until i was finished.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is my favorite version of Pride and Prejudice.  They did an excellent job picking out the actors for this film.  I adore the music and the scenes were so beautiful.  The book in itself is just wonderful but the way they brought it to life was just great.  This movie is a must have for anyone who loves period romance.  The dialog is so witty is just a classic.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|I would normally never watch this type of program.  From the first episode, I was drawn in to Dexter's dark vigilante process.  Can't wait for more.  Cherie Young
B00006JSS8|5.0|STEVIE WONDER-THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION: Any STEVIE WONDER anthology that doesn't include IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME, DON'T YOU WORRY 'BOUT A THING and I AIN'T GONNA STAND FOR IT can't really be labeled &#34;definitive&#34;, but the man has far too many hits to be contained to one platter anyway. This one does a pretty fair job reigning in most of the soul/pop genius' high points...including his teenaged breakthrough FINGERTIPS, the sixties classics UPTIGHT (EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT) and MY CHERIE AMOUR, his poignant seventies social commentaries HIGHER GROUND and YOU HAVEN'T DONE NOTHIN', and eighties smashes THAT GIRL and I JUST CALLED TO SAY I LOVE YOU. WONDER's multi-instrumental prowess, urgent vocal pleas, and prolific songwriting (he tossed off biggies for THE SPINNERS, ARETHA, RUFUS, among others) shine vividly on the joyous SIGNED SEALED DELIVERED I'M YOURS, funk anthem SUPERSTITION, and name dropping swing era tribute SIR DUKE. If only the small handful of lesser tracks like HEY LOVE and OVERJOYED had been replaced with those missing hits, DEFINITIVE COLLECTION would be one stop shopping for casual STEVIE WONDER fans.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE HARMONICA SOLOS
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|Great movie, all actors perform well. Dynamically filmed and very entertaining. Famous ABBA songs form important part of this film.
B005LAII08|5.0|I love that Disney now has a princess that does not need a prince to be complete or to rule her kingdom. Yes!!!!!!
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|This was a great primer for a parent whose child is now into playing Halo 4 and reading various Halo book series. It explained and showed in detail the various means by which the UNSC deals with the Covenant.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Some of these songs are the best !  I love Katie Sagals singing and her songs are wonderfully written and producted
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I wanted a desk mic for my ham station, but if you know anything about amateur radio you know how much money it takes to build a quality station. This mic was less than $ 25 and would have cost well over 100 if I went with the radio brand. I get excellent audio reports with this mic and that is all that matters. When I tell them its a cheap XM8500 they want to know where to get one. I am going to get another one for one of my other radios so I don't have to keep disconnecting and moving it around. This mic is also very well built and made out of quality materials. It came in a very nice foam lined case that will never see the light of day, but if you plan to use it on the road, the case will keep it looking like new.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is one of my very favorite movies. It's so well done and so beautiful, with all my favorite colors, it would be hard not to like it.<br />yes, it's the same old 'greed against the indigenous' plot but who cares!! Cameron did again with spectacular graphics.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Gave it to my daughter for Christmas.  To my amazement, she had never seen it, so it was the perfect gift.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Excellent plots and underplots as usual. New characters coming in and we don't know whether to trust them or not with our<br />dearly beloved SOA members.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|It was just OK...actually 3 1/2 stars but the 1/2 was not available...the silo was just not believable in todays logistics and terror watch lists....
B008LVCKH6|5.0|A fun, easy way to get a fast review of the history of the world in the last 100 years.
0307592731|5.0|I enjoyed this book, it was realistic and a heartwarming account of her adventures along the trail.  I actualy jumped a few times while reading, it was that vivid!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Another all-time favourite. This film always makes me smile. Love all of the various plots that all come together in the end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I enjoyed this insight into the life of a Seal and the factual account of the Bin Ladin mission. It was a very easy, page turning read.<br /><br />I guess the sign of a really good non fiction book is that it had me searching the net for further information on the subject. The controversy over whether he should or should not have written it has left me sitting on the fence, initially I was taken in by the &#34;just trying to do a public service&#34; preface but after having read he has subsequently got some ex team mates into hot water by selling secrets to a video gaming company I am now unsure of his motives and size of his ego.  Still, all that aside, there is no denying the huge respect I have for these guys.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this very enjoyable book and believable account of events.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I've never been much of a James Bond fan.  Most of the movies are okay, and some are just plain cheesy.  That being said, Skyfall isn't just a good Bond movie, it a really good movie period.<br />Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond so far, even if I did think Quantum of Solace was terrible.  Casino Royale and now Skyfall will surely cement him as one of the best Bonds.<br />What I like about Daniel Craig is that he, or maybe the Director, isn't afraid to show Bond's human side.  His weaknesses and flaws.  James Bond is a highly trained and very talented operative, but he has a disdain for authority and comes from a troubled past.<br />Javier Bardem plays my favorite villain in all of the James Bond movies.  most Bond villains are cheesy, but Bardems villain is actually scary.<br />Ralph Fiennes character is a bit of a surprise(in the direction his character takes through the movie), but surprising in a good way.<br />All in all, I would highly recommend this movie not only to James Bond fans, but to anyone who enjoys a good movie.  I think this will do as much to reinvigorate the Bond franchise and expand it's fanbase as the new Star Trek movie did a few years back to the Star Trek franchise.
B00435WX7G|5.0|I expected it would take a while to deliver, but it was really fast and a lot bigger than I imagined.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Preston  and Child never let the reader down.  Constant action, parallel plots, and challenging  vocabulary keep the reader engrossed.  They never disappoint!<br /><br />We
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I really liked this book, I loved the structure of the chapters and the underlying themese.<br />The only thing I found difficult were the little details. There were so many things to keep up with that I found this book harder to get through than my usual selection.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|This was my second Kate Morton novel.  thought I was not going to like it as much as The House At Riverton, but as it all come together it was worth the wait.  I love the author's use of launguage and her descriptions make the reader feel as if he or  she is there in the story.  Great atmosphere and rewarding coming together in the later chapters.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book When You Reach Me is a great book for people who love adventures. I hope that people will read this book.
B0070R40V6|4.0|Plenty of detail and history. Brill.<br /><br />Looking forward to reading the next in the series.<br /><br />If depth is what you're looking for, then this is worth the read.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|There are no other words to describe this. This book captures the feeling of this situation and amazing to the very end. I cried uncontrollably. The ending was completely unexpected. You never know how much you care until it's gone.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Vivid and disturbing characters, a plot that you think you know where it's going, and a rawness that will slice into your thoughts long after you finish reading. A very good novel that will likely make you a Gillian Flynn fan.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was another great game from g5. Stunning graphics and interesting plot. I definitely recommend it! Decent length although a little high priced.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I found this book grabbed my attention more than most and it was an incredibly fun read. I thought it dragged towards the end a bit, but it was still very good. I give it 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5, and a strong recommendation that you read it.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This was a good game. Very similar to other g5 products. Good graphics and plot.Decent length but a little high.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I really like the book. Kids will enjoy  the book. Adults will enjoy this too. Many people have seen the movie, but not read the book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks continues to grab readers from the first to the last page. I wanted to continue reading more of the life of Katie and Alex.
0486448843|5.0|Love his work. Great inexpensive way to get these. They are postcards and they are attached 4 to a page, but they are perforated so if u take the booklet apart by removing the staples and gently fold them back and forth a few times along the perforation they separate quite easily. I use them as bookmarks and also framed some.
B005906INY|4.0|Fun to watch and far from slapstick. Developing story of each personality involved in putting on a show to pull the characters out of economic and psychological slump.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who likes strategic board games but it also works for people just wanting to play a board game.  This game has the ability for in depth strategy for those long drawn out contests between friends who think they are smarter than each other but it also has the ability to satisfy even the rookie players.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We watched the first half of season 3, 8 episodes, in 2 nights.  Very intense.  If you enjoy the show, I highly recommend you get this.  You will not be disappointed.
B00846REIS|4.0|Can't wait to read the second book. Enjoyed every chapter. Always left you wanting to read more. Great job Sylvia day!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! But not as much as the hand dryers at Rave theaters. They are amazing when you need to dry your hands in a quickly to play this game.
0439023513|5.0|I bought the series of the books for one of my granddaughters.  She and her mom and reading the books together and discussing what they've read.  I personally think this is awesome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game.  I like solitaire and this game is fun to play.  I would recommend this game for people who like solitaire
0439023491|5.0|I bought the series of the books for one of my granddaughters.  She and her mom and reading the books together and discussing what they've read.  I personally think this is awesome.
1451673442|5.0|Wonderful book wonderful service.I received my  with the other right away and started read asap and it was better than I thought.
0439023483|5.0|I bought the series of the books for one of my granddaughters.  She and her mom and reading the books together and discussing what they've read.  I personally think this is awesome.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't get why everyone is complaining that is glitchy, it works fine and a lot better then the Facebook app that came with my Kindle (which was basically a hyperlink). I have not had any issues with it.
1419705849|5.0|I bought the series of the books for one of my granddaughters. She was so excited to have them.  Seems to be a very popular read!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|finished this one in just 2 hours. wish it could have been longer for $3. would buy more from this developer though. keep em coming!
0810993139|5.0|My granddaughters really wanted the series of these books.  Although they had seen the movie, they wanted the book so badly and have liked it more than the movie!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Gentlemen,<br />As with all your books, this was the creme Dr late creme! Can't wait for your next. Don't keep us waiting so long.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift for one of my granddaughters.  Since it has the 3 dvd's to be used on different mediums, we are able to have one at her house, one at my house and the third at her other grandparents!  It's awesome to get that value, and these Ice Age movies are the best!  My grandkids watch them over and over!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had put off reading the series and was going to be sucked into the hype.  I decided during my Christmas vacation I would do some mindless reading.  I was quickly sucked in.  I found the trilogy to be a raw love story and not just about S&M.  I highly recommend the series.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|this product would not download onto my kindle fire hd no matter how many times i tried it. My son also tried downloading on his kindle fire with no luck.
B006C5FWH8|4.0|it kills hours of time befor you know it.i recomend it for enyone who likes warhammer 40k. only a few bugs nothing to stop me from playing
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I totally enjoy listening to this album.  He is consistent and such a joy to listen to.  I would recommend this as a gift to any American Idol fan.
B0029LHW68|4.0|Good album, I had never heard of them before found them accidently.  Solid though out I like their style of music.
B000V6Q7SM|5.0|I have played the violin for years, and I enjoy good music- You can't go wrong with the combo of Mutter, Beethoven and the symphone music--Good choice if I don't say so my self
B007MDB548|5.0|Great video...the blue ray makes it even more awsome it is one that gets plenty of play at home, my daughter loves it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|enjoy playing when my wife or kids are at the doctor. like to see how high a score I can get. love playing the game with cards this is just so much better
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great mindless fun :) it certainly provides much needed entertainment throughout my otherwise boring day! If you like colorful, goal oriented games, you'll love this.
B008S4FZHI|4.0|As always this is a good read Cornwell has a way with a plot and this is no exception and makes the reader think as well as enjoy.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church is consistently such a great artist. I already had his second & third albums and decided that I needed the first one as well. I like almost every single song on all three CDs!
B0000214F0|5.0|It got here fast and was just as advertised , can't ask for more than that , would order again.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 are a must see to understand the differences occurring at the turn of the century in England.  Such a love story told in so man ways.
B005KMX866|3.0|I really liked him doing Elvis but I don't care for the crash, bam, boom, noisiness of Jerry Lee Lewis,  I'st my likes and dislikes--nothing to do with the music.  It was recommended to me by a friend.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|You have to hear it to believe the fantastic guitar playing.  Don't pass this one up (and his concerts are great too)
6300182282|5.0|Lighthearted take on adultry.  Recommended by friend.  Funny.  Sad also.  Liked the ending.  Seven more words required is what I saw, but I was finished with review.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I ordered this book after several friends had read and liked it. I read it, trying not to judge, but simply to stay open to the message it brought. Not a medical doctor, I had only moderate understanding of Dr. Alexander's condition during the coma, and, short of attending medical scholl, thought it unlikely that anything I could learn would bring me any closer. One thing struck me: he was dying of a disease that it was impossible for him to have. That made me wonder if the &#34;miracle&#34; of his NDE began before his coma, and, in fact, was part of God's plan from the beginning, assuming there was a plan. Yes, I approached it with a Christian point of view, since I consider myself Christian, but that does not make me incapable of conscious thought. I do certainly believe there is life after the transition we call death. What that life looks like, we can't know unless we make that trip. Did Dr. Alexander make the trip or dream it? If it was nothing else, it was a beautiful dream. Or is this the dream, and that brief experience the reality? I have many such questions, and didn't need this book to form them. I have long ago decided that the answers lie on the other side of the transition, and I am patient.  However, it is clear that the author wants to say something I consider vitally important: love is not an abstract, elusive emotion. It is the fabric of our lives and perhaps, as he says, the universe. If I take nothing from the book but that, I have received great value for my money. If we have love in our lives, we are blessed. Never mind the arguments over did he? Didn't he? We will all find out for ourselves one day.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a great hidden object game.  The graphics are good and the storyline is interesting.  The hint button helps navigate you if you get stuck.  I would reccommend this game.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Amazing that some fairly talented actors agreed to participate in a space age horror movie with no plot and no character development and a bunch of Ph.D.s running around like immature high school students. Ridley Scott should have hired a good hard science fiction writer.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I was looking for a great kindle book when I came across this book. How could I ignore those reviews and ratings? All of them were right.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings and series like that, you will be able to picture everything in this book with ease and clarity.<br /><br />This is an amazing book, a very quick read (I couldn't put it down) and it leaves me waiting for more by the author.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Not just any samurai vs. zombie game.  THE samurai vs. zombie game.  It will make you want to smack your grandma for not telling you about it sooner.  Speaking of that, if you're the kind of person who would smack your grandma, the last thing you need is another violent video game, which this blissfully is.  In that case, you need to download Paplinko, because there's nothing violent about it, and that little breakdancing star kid can only bring out the best in anybody.  Even you.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I wish I hadn't bought it. It is useless. I can't add my city. There are no instructions to help out.
B007EECSFA|4.0|It  was an excellent book by Kate Morton.  I have read most of all her books and found them to be very  entertaining and suspenseful.
B000001E7T|4.0|No one familiar with the forceful feminine perspective driving the lyrical content of PJ Harvey's debut and sophomore releases (&quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Rid Of Me&quot;) should have been surprised that the title of her third release was suggestive itself of an aggressive, liberated female libido, but rather at her startling recreation as a chanteuse mining not only the primal, heavy rhythms of the blues, but its mythology as well. Typical instrumentation and arrangements universally associated with the most elemental of musical genres are heavily isolated and amplified by the production of both John Parish and Flood, who sand some of the ancient layers off, though only to bring into focus the propulsive swell over which Harvey's lyrics confront the listener in a seductive growl, plaintive wail, or exquisite roar, her nuanced, sensitive vocal performance characterizing her earlier releases transformed here into a vehicle through which flows some things holy and some things carnal. Listeners who flocked to this recording due to the mechanized, orchestrated, fluidly percussive conveyor-belt pull of &quot;Down By The Water&quot; may have been within their rights to scream &quot;Bait and Switch!&quot;, but &quot;Send His Love To Me&quot; and &quot;The Dancer&quot; possessed their own level of elegance, and elsewhere other tracks just sounded possessed, animated by the universally primal tones of distorted guitar, thrumming bass, and sustained organ chords. &quot;To Bring You My Love&quot; , &quot;C'Mon Billy&quot;, and &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot; are all reflective of this approach. A brutal recording and probably not immediately accessible to everybody, it's nevertheless one of the best recordings released in the '90's , and is well worth snagging.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Excellent  the only thing that I have a problem with is this  section. The new features in this section and the rest of the book.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|While I love time travel movies, I found Looper to be unfocused and trying to be too much. As if time travel is not enough, for some reason it goes the direction of Heroes, which loses focus on the main topic. Character development is marginal so I found myself not caring too much about what happens in the end.    Best time travel movie ever: Primer (2004). [...]
B009KS4XRO|4.0|really like game but hate the trash talk in chat rooms. some times i have a little trouble with game .
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a good version of Spider, but the way the cards move when tapped takes some getting used to.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Obviously for a younger crowd but still was a good read.  Will read the next book as soon as possible.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not as good as the first book. Too predictable and a little slow moving. I hope book three is better.
0399160450|5.0|another great book by Tom Clancy you can always expect the best from his books. would recommend to anyone to get his books
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I normally am not a fantasy type reader,  prefer more mysteries,  remance etc. But this entire Eragon series has been awesome and I can't wait to read Inheritance! Its in intriguing , totally keeps my interest and keeps me guessing and wondering. The way Paolini writes is easy to read,  very descriptive. With other fantasy books I've read, They often have too much detail and tend to be confusing and over the top. In my opinion,  better than the Harry Potter Series!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This sure is no Angry Birds game!  At first the levels are easy, but the further you go, the harder they get.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Worth the read. Not very happy about the ending but I can't wait to start the last book!! Highly recommended
B005VGMYZM|5.0|We have not played this DVD yet, but will look forward to seeing it with his always wonderful music and flair for putting out a wonderful performance every time.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This was quite a story in that it showcased the love of two people who knew each other almost from birth and into a romance.  Nice.  I did think that the reason for &#34;her&#34; wanting to end her life was not underlined enough so that I was groping for the that dastardly event that made her suicidal and feeling dirty.  And I felt that &#34;he&#34; made his life unnecessarily difficult by not telling the story of their &#34;pact&#34;, and its outcome, and being honest from the start. These teens were a jumble of rampant feelings - and so were the adults -  hard to capture and write about, well done Jodi.<br />The story was strewn with lovely passages, heartfelt and meaningful, just the sort of words I love to read.  Every woman should have a man like him - loyal, with a heart that is only for her. I've got one of those, lucky me!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|got here on time movie was awesome  thanks!  saw it in the theater and new we had to own it on dvd
B007MJSQSK|4.0|Even if the movie took liberties from the original book, it was very entertaining. Great cinematography,entertaining story, and interesting characters. In other words, wonderful.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|When I first saw this item I wasn't sure it would be anything I could use but low and behold I'm wrong.  There is a ton of space in the camera case that it could easily hold a slr or any digital slr that I could try.  I have mostly Olympus products and I am able to fit my better point and shoot digital slr on the bottom and put the dividers in and put my little point and shoot Fuji on top along with batteries and USB cables and battery chargers.  This is basically something I have been looking for for quite some time.<br /><br />I did try one of my older Olympus SLR camera's in her with two lenses and it just made it in room.  I tend to shoot differently at times when I go out so sometimes I might go digital and sometimes just the old fashioned film.<br /><br />The case is made very sturdy and with multiple zippers which is a nice feature in my book.  I hate having one zipper and then when you open it you take a chance at things falling out even when most careful.  The strap is fantastic.  It has a padded section for your shoulder and is quite comfortable.  The strap also adjusts from a smaller size that you could probably put around your waist to a full out cross body feature that will make you feel secure no matter where you are when shooting photos.  It has side pockets that I put my cell phone in and my car keys and then there is no need of me carrying anything else to hold those items.  It's just the bees knees to be honest and well worth every penny.<br /><br />This would make a fantastic gift for someone or even a nice treat for yourself.  Think about it, don't you deserve to have a nice secure item for carrying your favorite equipment.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|What can I say. My son had to read it for school. Easy read . He lived every minute  I am sure this his first of many classic reading
B002SR2PKG|5.0|i havent read this one for several years,  after reading it again I still rate this as one of Stephen KIngs very best.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book speaks volumes on true love, on being a teenager, and dealing with suicide. Absolutely amazing from front to back.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|although I dont really see what all the hoopla is about these books, somehow I get sucked in.....if only the author would use different words for &#34;sensitive&#34; things. Its supposed to be raw and sexual, but gets ruined with the pronouns used.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This was a great, fairly quick read with plenty of times when I laughed out loud.  Tina Fey is hilarious!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|First history book I actually can say I enjoyed reading. It offers a good review of different nations and why some of them are succeeding while others are failing--inclusive vs. extractive practices! The authors did a good job of explaining the difference between both.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|She loved it.  I purchased because of the sleep feature when you close the cover.  Also liked the feature of placing the Kindle at various angles when in use.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower was such a great read. The characters are developed very well throughout the story, and it was easy to make a connection with each one. This book had a wonderful balance of humor and raw human emotion. Definitely worth reading!
B00486U2VY|5.0|I loved this book, so much better than the tv series. I will definately purchase more of the Pretty little Liars books.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|I am a Tim Burton fan, except for his live action movies.  How he could have single- handedly destroyed a franchise like Batman I don;t know.  But this movie is really cute... but way too graphic and dark for children.  Adults won't see it because it's an animated movie; kids won't see it because their parent's will see it as inappropriate.  But other then adults and kids, Burton has made a movie that will be enjoyed by all the rest.
B0035OC830|5.0|Another very entertaining yarn by this author- his quips and asides are always humorous - lots of laugh out loud moments<br />- highly recommended…
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Interesting subject matter. After just a few chapters, Ifound it diffficult to put down! I plan to read more of this author's books,<br />I hope the others are just as readable as this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love all of these books....they are great read.....they definitely can keep a person very, EL James is a very descriptive author!!!  Loved reading them all!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I good read! Better than the movie. Very detailed and holds your interest every word. Would recommend to any one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading, but I absolutely loved reading these books!!  E L James is an amazing writer......very dynamic and very hot!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover hit it out of the park on this one.  This book was fantastic, great twists and turns. Is is a must read!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have bought and now read all three of these books....I have love them all and will definitely read them again.....Mr. Grey is definitely a little twisted but boy these books are great!!!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really had no idea what I was getting into when I started this book, but I was really touched by the story and would recommend it to an adult reader who is looking for something heartwarming.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER! I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO READ THIS AGAIN! It was very well written, and very sad, and overall just awesome!!!!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This device really makes a difference (along with quality headphones) as you can hear music like you've never heard it before.  Well worth the cost if your a music geek.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved all three books. Read them in less than a month. EL James is an amazing author I recommend these books
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It is very breathtaking to read because of the triumphant feats pi faces.<br />It is why you think it is great that it is
B009VA1FN6|4.0|It is a nice light book for holiday reading. I enjoyed it more than  her previous novel &#34;Shifting Fog&#34; which had a more predictable ending.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I love the Lincoln Lawyer series.  Michael Connelly's writing style is so effortless it puts you right into the story.  I hope there are more to come in this series.  I know I'd buy as soon as it would become available.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy playing the game. it's very easy to use.  If you like playing &#34;Solitare&#34; you'll enjoy this.  However, DO NOT LIKE the pop-ups that come each and every time you play the game.  POP-UPS MUST GO!!
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone and anyone. Since it's based on a true story it is even better.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I thought this would be a chick flick. I only got it because of the caliber of the actors (Dame Judy Dench for one).  Boy was I wrong!  A number of elderly Brits head to India with different backStories. They end up in a ramshackle hotel with its own story.  All the characters adapt with varying degrees of success and outcomes.<br />I thought I would only tolerate the movie. I actually enjoyed the movie, engrossed in the various plots and ended up enjoying the movie.  Will definately watch again and again. I am glad I was wrong about the film!
B005LAII12|5.0|We loved ted,  he was so funny and true to life.... what a great story.... really enjoyed the movie...very very funny
B0063IH60K|5.0|if u love the game you'll love the app. I love how it doesn't require Internet to work... so if you are somewhere with no hook up for the net you still have your game to keep boredom away!!!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Excellent!<br />Assuming in site to the movie. A mistress of you liked the movie. Can't wait to read the sequel.
B00004YRQA|5.0|muy buen producto llego en el tiempo esperado y con las condiciones de la publicación lo recomiendo al 100 %
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is challenging, however, it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't! At first I got the FREE version, but I was limited to the different puzzles. I just bought
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so much fun its so addticting so much i like the water noises it makes this app i cant stop playing soo much fun im on like level 30 so much funnnnn
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|the voices were hard to understand.  Muffled and unclear and I began to lose interest in the very beginning because I could not hear what was being said,  especially Chris Pratt if he was the one doing the main interrogating.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I watched, Thor, Captain America, and the Avengers in order in about a weeks time.  It was great to watching them in sequence and the Avengers was the best.  I don't claim to be a movie critic, but I know what I like and am entertained by. The Avengers was extremely entertaining and like I said, I loved it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I had not seen the trilogy but my brother told me how important it was to see all at 1 X. I am now a believer. Skipped work 1 night just to watch 'em all. Now, I'm waiting on the Robin episodes.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was easy to follow and had a great story. I didn't get stuck except for freeing the clown. Go look at the clock above the orphanage. Wink wink. Definitely worth the money.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a very fun game to play.  Makes you think because you have to figure out how to get this little guy his candy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is such a great show! We love the classic background that is incorporated into every day modern life! It is a very original storyline and very addicting!
B007HACDLK|5.0|A real page turner. Could not put this down. Suspense was outstanding.  Mitch Rapp was his regular no villainy self.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|After the recent bout of massacres I found the scenes involving mass shooting of innocent people by terrorist who could get through security unsettling. The time of these movies being entertaining has passed. Plus it was way too long and if you didn't follow the comic books the plot was confusing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book the more I read the more into it i got an  could not even sleep because I wanted to keep reading  it specially at the end. I enjoyed reading it but also felt sad just thinking.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|I love this movie because it has a great story, great acting, etc AND an awesome message!  I have so much respect for Denzel Washington and am thankful that he makes movies with messages that people actually want to see.  This is my favorite of his movies.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is very good i recommend it to people who want to read this very good book.you should read it
0316228532|3.0|This book was very slow for the first 3/4's of the book.  Very soap-operish and I expected something better from this author.  It got better at the end, but I wouldn't recommend this book highly by any means.  Most of the characters were unlikeable and it mirrored too much of today's society where people are preoccupied with the wrong things in life and are oblivious to more important topics like their children and helping them to grow into worthy adults.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|No, I don't have an addictive personality, but I found myself opening it at 4am to play the full,paid addition! Please fix! it just started freezing on my Nexus7 after several days of play...However, I find the graphics and play exciting compared to the standard, boring windows PC versions. I keep playing despite the (freeze). Just back it up one level and it should unfreeze:-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps my child busy andbloves the challenges it brings to her. having the ability to be able to.play some new and challenging games while on the road or sick at home she enjoys.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|When I first read this book it was just to get to the end, then I did a reread so that I could understand the book.  A good read and the movie was really close, better than that mess they made of the vampires. Recommend to anyone who can get through the violence .
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|This app is a must have, tryout the free version for as long as you need but I'm sure you just like myself will end up having this app in your top 3. So pay the small amount for pro and the app is even better plus it gives the creators the resources and motivation to continue improving and creating apps (AntTek is my favorite app designer for a reason, quality). This the best ram cleaning app on the market!!!!<br /><br />PS: When I first got this app I had tried numerous other ram recovery apps and they all had been subpar or even a few acceptable, but Ram Booster Pro is just miles past anything in this category available now.<br /><br />Thank you AntTek!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book. I read the whole trilogy in a week. I couldn't put it down. Definitely a must read...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was hooked on this trilogy since the first Hunger Games book, I loved the second one and now the third and final book has blown me away. Usually I can see where the final book in a trilogy is going, but this one had me guessing all the way to the end. The final battle is amazing, these characters who we've come to love and understand are thrown into chaos and I was on the edge of my seat to see who would live and who would die. If you've read the first two then you must get this one and complete the trilogy, the ending will have mixed reviews, but I think that is the sign of great writing, it makes you think and understand everything is not happily ever after.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My Little Pony for Kindle Fire is far more fun than I could have imagined. MY son got a Kindle Fire for Christmas,and begged me to download it onto mine also. He needed another friend to play with him. I gave in after a few hours. I started playing this game and couldn't stop. It's highly addictive. This game is endless fun for children and adults alike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the first Hunger Games book, and my first thought going into this one was, how could Suzanne Collins top herself? Well the answer is in Catching Fire. This was a great successor to the first book, and kept me hooked since page one. The addition of new characters made the story richer and more enthralling, the game itself this time around was very interesting and kept me guessing all the way to the end. If you enjoyed the first book then I highly recommend you pick this one up right away because you will not be disappointed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a great book to read. I enjoyed every second of it. I love sky and holder. The book made me realized how much we need to be strong.
0345803485|3.0|If, as the press suggests, the women who have made this a run-away best seller see it as a sex manual, they should be aware of its major flaw. It prints no diagrams.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Get suspense in a love story that has you hooked from the first page.  Good reminders of what is really important!
1849514003|5.0|[[ASIN:1849514003 Cocos2d for iPhone 1 Game Development Cookbook]]<br /><br />100 % cocos2d , games AI GOODNESS!!!<br />Indeed this book answered most of my questions when I decided to build my game in Cocos2d! Look no further, this book is such a time saver, it is worth every penny. Appropriate for any level!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game is a little hard to follow and understand. however I recommend this game for people who like challenges .<br />..
B00174TKGI|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Denzel kills it in every movie he gets in. I have watched this movie at least 5 times and I keep watching it
B009VSW15Y|3.0|I am new at using my Kindle and unwittingly bought the Kindle Tablet Edition.  Guess that is why it does not work as well as I had hoped
B000SEGUDE|4.0|It is thought-provoking, funny at times, intriguing at times, and often sad.  I think the disjointed structure is challenging but maybe causes the reader to pay greater attention.<br /><br />Not for an &#34;inexperienced&#34; fiction reader.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|My Grandaughter liked it until she got her leap pad for Christmas.  The app for drawing is better for her on her devise.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|It's exactly what you'd expect. And it's a little long. But funny throughout. And crass, like the doctor ordered. Good show.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|A great album. Fantastic guitar by Jimmie Page and vocals from Robert Plant. Another one of Led Zeppelin's best. A must have for anyone who loves 70's rock.
B0016CTX1S|4.0|Not one of the Rolling Stone's most well know albums, but it is a real gem! The bad boys of 60's rock version of a Magical Mystery Tour!
0425263908|4.0|I was looking for something to read after the Fifty trilogy, this series was the most recommended...after reading it, I think I actually like it better. There is an actual story line and I found myself just as involved in the characters. If you like the Fifty Shades series, I highly recommend this one as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|A great movie with a great price! Hate that they ended the franchise though. I like the fact that there both the blueray and DVD are included.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This is a dark story.  But a captivating one. Especially thanks to the two main actors who do an amazing job.  If you like to watch great actors, this is a must see.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|Too expensive for quality of holder but appreciate its protective qualities.  Stand is great idea, when multi-tasking. at let's say a desk job!!
B004H4XI5O|4.0|If you are looking for a quick way to fix your memory problems this is not your type of book (and I doubt any exist). That was kind of disappointing for me to know/learn but why do I still rate it highly? The author, Joshua Foer, is down to earth and takes you through a personal journey of discovery which in turn helps you discover a lot about yourself and your brain and how it works. I think I will read the book again:-)!
B007ZLKKZM|5.0|It's George Harrison and If'n I need say More then I can't help You. One of the Best Guitarist to ever live.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|Make a movie or make a video game. That's all this seemed to be is a trailer for a video game. I love resident evil but the last 2 are simply a ridiculous waste of time. I was wanting it to end so badly, yet it just kept dragging on, and of course its not over yet. Cant imagine it can get any worse.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I honestly hate this show.  I have never wanted a show to end so badly as Pretty Little Liars.  I only say that I hate it and I want it to end because, after every episode, I am left wanting more, and have more questions.  In case you haven't figured it out yet, I am being sarcastic. This is seriously one of the best shows ever written.  I want this show to end because I want to know who -A is.  I have never seen a show or movie that has sucked you in as much as Pretty Little Liars has.  This show frustrates me to no end, in a good way.  Each episode makes me change my mind about who has done what, and after 3 seasons, I still have no clue who to trust.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend Pretty Little Liars, and apologize in advance for getting you sucked in to one of the best shows on TV.
1449410243|5.0|This book of &#34;Cattoons&#34; was hysterical. My sister enjoyed it, as did I. A must for every cat owner who wonders about the actions of their cats.
B006O6F932|5.0|my granddaughter felt this was an excellent product and exceeded her expectations.she enjoyed playing with and still does and looks foward to next new product
B00000JTB2|5.0|Awesome item. Took a little longer than i wanted to arrive but that was probably because it was Christmas time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The update is amazing!!! A must have app!! Keep the updates coming&hellip;&hellip; Way better than temple run!!! P.S. did i say this game is amazing??!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a good read, amazing how they keep you guessing then it comes together. I will read this author again.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Excellent reading material for middle school students.  Humorous but also touching.  Favorite character was Bob Cratchit.  Good job, Charles Dickens.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|this is fun, and it requires coordination. I am currently burning my way through some of the levels, It is fun when you get tired of the first game, and you want to switch things up.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was awes<br />ome !!!!!!!!! :) also interesting duh I loved it a lot of people should  read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO LIE!!!!! :)
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  I had no idea what was really behind all the killing.  Never knew who the bad guys were till the end.  A great plot driven thriller. Baldacci is a master.
B0086700CM|3.0|I find this game quite addictive but I must admit I'm not very good at it. It works smoothly on my Kindle Fire HD. However, after playing it many many times, my furthest run has been only 2900 meters. And this is my problem. I don't quite see the point. Everything you can buy with the coins you earn only seems to give you the ability to get a head start or get more coins, but you still have to start over again from the beginning. With most games, earning points lets you unlock new environments, for example. I wasted 5000 coins buying a background, thinking it would give me a new environment... but it's just an image which I have no use for (I don't see a way of using a background on my device). Do the characters come with different powers/abilities? Am I missing something because I haven't run far enough?
B0067R0APK|5.0|This app was free, yet it delivers the current temperature, the expected hourly temperatures and cloud conditions for the next 12 hours, the weekly forecast and  other weather data that you might enjoy.  It will do this for several zip codes, so that you can check weather at a friend or relatives house quickly.<br />The radar map is also useful if you just want a map for checking out geography, since you can move it around, blow it up, size it down, find out where that dinky little town your high school girl friend ended up in really is.  Of course you can tell if it is raining on her also.<br />Not a perfect ap, it does not give recent high and low temps for example, but excellent for the price.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Keeps your eyes on screen! Much better than the original one. Watched it with a 5 y.o. and 12 y.o. boys and both enjoyed it<br />a lot!
B004QQWA84|5.0|First, I'm not a Mercyful Fate fan.  A little of King Diamond's operatic caterwauling goes a long way with me.  The music is pretty good, but not enough to make me run out and get it.  Cirith Ungol, the other referenced band here, was so underground most won't appreciate the comparison unless they're really deep in obscure metal.  I know who they were, but never heard them, so my review will come from a different perspective.<br />  In Solitude got my attention from a couple of reviews that slobbered all over themselves in praise of this band.  Since most music critics are more prone to be cruel just so they can show readers how erudite and clever they are, or more importantly, how they want us to think they are, when they do a positive review of this sort they are usually on to something.<br />  \\"The World, The Flesh, The Devil\\" isn't quite the retro trip you might expect.  I in fact found them to be a bit difficult to categorize, and that helps their own identity.  Sure, the early Iron Maiden resemblance is there, but only in passing and the galloping rhythm patterns, especially the last track \\"On Burning Paths\\".  \\"To Her Darkness\\" is my favorite track, with a guitar hook worthy of the heaviest Priest or Sabbath variety.  The vocals are clean if somewhat limiting in range, and the lead playing is sharp as hell.<br />  But where exactly do this guys dwell in the metal realm?  While their early '80's thrash influence is undeniable, I catch a very dark vibe and even a doomy feel to the proceedings, not because of the music but the atmosphere of the production.  There is a sense of depression here that harkens to Katatonia, and a dark riffing vibe that also recalls very early Celtic Frost, but better played.<br />  In Solitude brings the darkness of the Scandinavian winter cold, the slash of the grimier aspects of thrash and a forlorn feel that may be at home on a Paradise Lost album, although the music does not sound the same.  This is a mesh of several styles, the early thrash serving as bedrock.  Call it dark thrash, perhaps.  These guys are going places.arly thrash serving as bedrock.  Call it dark thrash, perhaps.  These guys are going places.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend suggested this game for my Mother who is 91 years old and owns her own iPAD.  She has been playing it every day since she learned it which was 5 days ago.  She loves it.  I know playing this game is helping with eye hand coordination and is keeping her mental juicies flowing. When asked what does she like about the game, she replied, &#34;I like the challenge.&#34;
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Inspiring. If you think you've had a bad day, you haven't. This man has courage and an amazing will to live.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good exercise for the brain.  Starts out easy but gets harder so you don't get bored. It also helps you see thingsfrom different. perspectives.
B004SOR4H6|1.0|As far as I'm concerned this is a waste of valuable time.  I personally don't care what people are thinking or doing every minute of their lives and they can keep their random thoughts to themselves.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|The magnificent Jennifer Lawrence carries this film, with strong supporting performances by Elisabeth Shue (\\"The Karate Kid\\") and Max Thieriot.  Mostly you think you know where this one is going, but there are enough twists to keep it from being overly predictable.  Jennifer Lawrence is as appealing as always; this actress has mastered the art of making the viewer care about what happens to her in a storyline.  She is beautiful without being unreachable, and does an excellent job in this one.  Elisabeth Shue is very convincing as the flawed mother trying to at last grow up into a mature adult, but not quite managing to do so.  An allegory for our times.  Max Thieriot is very good as the vulnerable but ultimately sinister \\"boy next door.\\"<br /><br />No spoilers here except to say that while I thought that I knew where this one was headed, it faked me out at least once.  This film succeeds in being entertaining, and it has an excellently paced storyline. Recommended.  RJB.
B007S7U4AY|4.0|Muy Buena novela.Muy buenos personajes.Nueva tematica y Muy bien definida la trama,uno vive las emociones del personaje central.La recomiendo.<br />Ahora quiero mas libros de esta misma aurora.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|People simply do not behave the way these Pretty People all behave.  Basically, the premise here is that people jump in and out out bed without much, or any, thought and that the jumping is the subject of endless vulgar discussion over cocktails or dinner.  Put another way, this film is vulgar nonsense.  Nothing wrong with that if it is also entertaining, but really, this film is a clean miss.  Fortunately I watched it via my Amazon Prime membership and did not pay a penny to see it.  Had I in fact paid as much as one cent it would have been a rip-off.<br /><br />Some nice looking eye candy for the guys and beefcake for the gals, but other than that this film has no redeeming features whatever. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did.  RJB.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|Treasure Planet is an unknown gem to many people I have spoken to. It is not your typical Disney fairy tale nor is it a whimsical child's movie, even though it's perfectly suited for children. It's the fusion of the classic Treasure Island with a futuristic space and steampunk setting. There's plenty of action and adventure along with a few heartfelt Disney moments.  This movie is among my all time favorite animated features.  Definitely a must see.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was a fasinating book! It had a great ending!! Why do I have to type ten more words, I don't want to.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it but I had a bunch of hoverbords and chacters and then it started over...I think there stealing temple run too
0763644765|5.0|I bought 3 of these books to read and share with children in the church nursery.  After the second reading, they were sitting on the floor reading it to each other.  They loved selecting their favorite pictures of underwear shown on the last pages. Of course the parents deserve 99% of the credit for maintaining regular training schedules and positive reinforcement, but the reading supplements and rewards of &#34;fish&#34; crackers made it more fun for all.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This novel is a delightful journey of relationships. The writing is witty and fast paced and the characters are thoroughly engaging.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|With my new Kindle Fire HD, I wanted an Angry Bird app. This wasn't it. Not well enough to keep my interest.
B001V58BUY|5.0|My family just loves this retelling of the classic story (much more than the animated version).  We are particularly fond of the actor playing Hook (and the Dad).  The mere fact that he played both roles reinforces the idea that all grown-ups are the same, but children are magical.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game its beyond addicting and I play it every chance I get. My favorite bubble popper game!!
B0079R8IYW|2.0|Is a good cover but does not stay standing up.<br /> I bought it to be able to prop up the book but still have to hold the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of the best solitaire apps out there. Not to hard to figure out and doesn't have the unnecessary add ons most of the others do!
B005DD7H50|4.0|good movie. and i just have to say at first i was thinking the same thing as many people thought about him learning to make the pill himself...but then its stupid bc he'd just be addicted to it and living off it. in the end he learns not to, and thats actually pretty smart, and on top of that he still maintains his abilities. genius!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|So fun to play! Addicting and really awesome! The tips are good to for when you get stuck! I would buy more games from this developer!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Really enjoyed this book .<br />Very imaginative story ,wonderfully well paced ,<br />I will be looking for more Gillian Flynn books . A little disappointed by the ending ,but accept the plot was so marvellous and suspense so well maintained that it was hard to find any other ending .
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Loved this whole series! It was really addicting to read!! I always wanted to know more and what was going to happen next!
B00746TURW|2.0|very underwhelmed with this book .I have really enjoyed all other books by Richard Ford ,but this one dragged ,to be honest I found it boring ,a very poor story and disjointed .
B0058VW36U|5.0|LOVE this game and its so addicting!! Its hard to put down and Im always playing it! Can't wait for more!
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but I thought it was very graphic in terms of violence. This must be a new direction for them because I never seen so much killing in these DC movies before. It so much darker now, where as before, when someone is about to die, they don't show it actually. Instead, what you see is zone out of the scene and come back to it after the death. They did do that a few times in the movie, but when I started to see the Joker killing bystanders out of the blue, I was like that's odd and sad. How did this thing manage a PG-13 rating? The rating people must be getting more lead way with violence now.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|LOVE this game and its so addicting!! Its hard to put down and Im always playing it! Can't wait for more!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is a wonderful easily read second installment in this series. Hard to put down. Follett is an excellent writer.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|LOVE this game and its so addicting!! Its hard to put down and Im always playing it! Can't wait for more!
B00632HWOG|4.0|love using this on my Kindle Fire HD<br />it's nice to pull it from my favorites & walla, there you are
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is one of the worst facebook apps Ive ever used. It's so slow and won't let me see any more than the last 15 post! Really needs some help!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Love love love the book. This ebook had quite a few typos, but nothing that made it unreadable. Plus, it was free, so I'm not complaining.
B0028AQLYE|5.0|I swim for i hour at least one time a week and by using this snorkel, it allows me to go at a slower pace without lifting my head out of the water. I use this in conjunction with my FINIS SwiMP3 2G headphones under water for a completely enjoyable swim!!
B000JMKSE2|5.0|A must read for everybody involved in E-business. Chris Anderson makes compelling arguments backed by solid research and data. Even after some years on the shelf this book is still relevant for people who wants to understand why the local shop on the corner is closing.
B0013UZHS6|2.0|I guess I went with the age on the box (i.e. 4+), which my son is.... but these windows and doors are for little legos and NOT the duplo sized ones he's still using.  So, in the attic they went, awaiting future birthdays (say when he's 8).
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|What a great movie! This is great for kids of all ages. Definitely recommend it. We have watched is a handful of times already - and I'm sure will be watching it again and again. It is that good! Seriously, this is probably one of my all-time favorite Disney movies to date.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying and watching over and over!
B00846REIS|4.0|Really hated the way the book ended. Other than that a very good book. Alot like 50 shades of grey but the words are more graphic and the sex not as freaky.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This story has truly rekindled the love & relationship I have and continue to have with my loving man, husband,lover & soulmate!
B005LAIGQE|4.0|This is a great movie.  My children are both in to animals and making sure they were safe.  I thought there were positive messages in this movie.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|it's amazing even on the update  the 1star revew was dum becas it said you<br /> have to 3star every level or pay 1.99 i boght it it is so hard to 3 star every levle .
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie and great colors.  The entire family enjoyed this movie including my eleven year old and my eight year old.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|When I ordered it it was said to fit my new Kindle fire.  It is entirely too small.  Very disappointed!
B000KJT8IG|3.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this movie, but there is a lot of swearing.  So, definitely be careful it with younger children.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|It took some time to navigate the app and add alarms, not simply adjust the two default options. The ring tone options are not all conducive to waking a person; but if they are reminder alarms, there is a wide variety to select from so merely hearing the alarm indicated the reminder without looking at the title.

B00198X0VS|4.0|I had already owned this movie on VHS and decided it was time to upgrade to Blu-ray.  Love the movie and it was even better on Blu-ray.
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|I have watched this over and over too. I loved the feel good content and the fact that it was a true story
B0053O89IS|5.0|I would strongly recommend this series to anyone.  The chemistry between Booth and Brennan is what keeps this show going.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Enjoyed this book quite a bit! Wonderful love story and wonderful characters. I particularly appreciated the perspective offered by each character.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I bought this game for my husband who is a Star Wars junkie!! He absolutely loves this game. If you like Angry Birds and you like Star Wars then you will love this game too.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|This movie was great!!!! My husband and I love the Men In Black movies so when we got the first 2 on Blu-ray we decided to just purchase this one with them.  We had a lot of laughs and would recommend this movie.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|Matt Smith...Matt Smith... I have to be honest here when I first saw he was going to be the new Doctor I did not think he looked the part.  But after see the shows he is very good being the 11th Doctor.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|My four year old daughter likes this, but due to it being &#34;resusable&#34; it does not stick very well and we end up finding pieces all over the house.  It would probably work great for a road trip or airport activity.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|Complete series PLUS the Christmas carol show.  Would have been nice to know before I got the Christmas carol Doctor Who but I look at it as a bonus.  LOL
1452110581|5.0|My 2 daughters live together with 3 cats and a dog. When they opened this Christmas gift all gift opening stopped and they had to read from this book. They could relate to every poem and we all laughed heartily as they read and told their own similar experiences.
B004SRNH10|1.0|Massive, invasive bloatware that insists on phoning home to run... I can't wait for the day they go belly-up and a company that doesn't suck buys their product lines and finally spends developer hours fixing bugs and security holes rather than protection schmes based upon the assumption their users are all thieves. Uses to be jazzed when a piece of hardware came with Photoshop LE. Acrobat was serious business software. Now it's all attack surface I can (and gladly DO) live without.<br /><br />Please, developers... STOP using Adobe bloatware so we can finally watch the company die a well-deserved death.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|It's rare that LEGO comes up with a Batman set and it's not popular. This one is no exception.<br />This set contains three minifigs (Batman, Joker and Joker's Henchman) and two aircrafts ( Batwing and a Helicopter).<br />The Batman minifig is just awesome. Joker minifig  is  cool. The Joker comes with a nice Tommy-gun.(You can fix a flag on it but I felt it looks ridiculous, so I didn't.) The Joker's henchman is another cool minifig. So with this set, there is absolutely NO complaints with the minifigs provided.<br />The Batwing looks awesome. A brilliant design.The black color makes it look super-cool. A beautiful piece. Couldn't take my eyes off it once I was done assembling it! Apart from two flick missiles, it also has one cool bat-shaped missile (the bat shape comes because of two axe pieces; very creative thinking). There's a play feature where you push a button and this missile drops. This is a neat feature which kids AND Adults will like. What use is a fighter plane that can't fire a missile right?  But there's a slight feeling I have that the designers could have done a better job with the exteriors. I mean, though the plane looks very good , no doubt, but it looks bit plain, for a bat-vehicle.Maybe some more well-designed bricks on the wings, could have improved the appearance and given more \\"teeth\\" to this aircraft.Also, in the cockpit, Batman just slides in there, there's no studs to keep him in place. But, overall, the Batwing is a visual delight, that I can assure you.<br />The Helicopter is also very fantastic!  The tail-piece is one big single LEGO brick, which looks nice. Even the propeller blades are nice. There's a big missile with Joker's face printed on it, which looks good. There's a rope-ladder provided with the chopper, which is amazing. (The way this rope ladder is assembled is very creative). Someday I'll order some more of this choppers from eBay and create a small fleet!<br />Two things I hated about this set :<br />1) Stickers.LEGO needs to completely STOP with stickering and come out with printed bricks. The smaller the sticker, the more difficult it is to get them positioned right in the first attempt. And bby the time , you get them placed right, the sticker would have become smudged.<br />2) With ever Superhero set, LEGO gives a comic book, which is the dumbest , lamest, Z-grade comic book ever. There are no words, which are still ok but the story displayed in these comics are lame to the core. These comics are nowhere near to becoming a  collectible. If LEGO can't improve the quality of these comics, better they stop giving them with these sets. Better thay can give some printed name-cards of the Heroes & villains , rather than this stupid comic. Even kids also may find this comic boring. LEGO is known for it's high standards and quality worldwide but this comic seems to indicate otherwise.<br />This set is no doubt a collectible for Batman fans. But I can't say the same for  LEGO fans. The reason is that the two main minifigs in this set, are not exclusive to this set. Batman and Joker , you can get them in the \\"Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape\\" set which is an Awesome set with a lot more minifigs and features than this set.  But still, that doesn't make this set redundant. The Joker's Henchman is a cool minfig. The Batwing and Helicopter are pretty amazing. Kids will enjoy creating many battle scenes between the Batwing and the Helicopter. Adults will love just keeping them in the display-case as these aircrafts look beautiful! And for Batman fans, this set is priceless; a collector's-item.
B00004TS0E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies. It is just as good as the classic and a little more modern.
0812981448|5.0|Loved this book. I aspire to start something similar to what Blake did so reading about others like Blake and how they were able to accomplish their goals was very encouraging.
1400069289|1.0|..but I was wrong.  It's actually a collection of folksy anecdotes from NFL and a couple of other sports I've forgotten already.  And chuck in a couple of overly long corporate success anecdotes.  The author could quite easily have stated the salient points in dot form on a single page - about the length of my own summary of the book.  Possibly the worst example of an over-padded book in the popular science genre I've come across.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Banks uses the very consistent Culture universe to build a great story inhabited with powerful characters. Very pleasant to read, great humor and perfect rhythm, nothing surprising coming from one of the greatest contemporary science fiction witter
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Paranormal Agency was a lot of fun.  I downloaded as Free App of the Day in the past and just got around to playing through.  The object hunts were challenging but doable.  I used very few hints, although I had plenty of fun collecting them as bonus searches.  I had 180+ by the end. There are several formats, including search by silouette or item name, search for items of a certain type, find transparent objects, and find items and draw a connecting line pattern.  There are also mini games such as memory cards, match objects, and &quot;astral threads&quot;.<br /><br />The astral thread objective got a bit confusing for me late in the game.  For anyone else at a loss, the goal is to have no remaining thread crosses except to light the gems.<br /><br />I personally found the characters and dialogue refreshing.  So nice to have a plot with unexpected twists. It reminded me very much of old detective noir (The Maltese Falcon comes to mind).<br /><br />Gameplay was smooth and fast on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  Only bad things I can say are that the game goes by quickly and that there is little replay value.  No unlockables or trophies here.  I wish they would make a sequel!

B0079XPUOW|4.0|This brings a good dose of humor to your sci-fi reading. If you love Star Trek i all it iterations you will probably really like this book. If you merely like or tolerate Star Trek, like I do, it is still a worthwhile book. Perhaps not as good as his Old Man's War series, but an excellent read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was completely sucked in from the moment Christian Grey entered the story! I can not wait to begin the next book!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|If you have any interest in Science Fiction you owe it to yourself to read this book. A likable protagonist and a great premise. The first in a series of books that are wildly entertaining. They do not all have the same main character and some are not even in all the books, but they tend to recur and recombine in interesting ways. It opens with a retired American man of 75 about to commit himself to serving in the military for the mysterious government of humanity's space colonies. In exchange he expects to receive unspecified medical treatments to prolong his life and restore some measure of strength and vitality. He also gets to learn something about the colonies and the universe, knowledge that the colonial government has carefully kept hidden from the inhabitant on Earth. After his service he gains the right to become a colonist, a path otherwise reserved for the citizens of less affluent and more overpopulated countries. Any more would spoil the book, get it now!
075669812X|5.0|I received the book quickly. It was brand new and in great condition just like it said. I give it 5 stars. Im very happy with my merchandise.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like to win your games this is the one for you.  With a little forethought Spider can generally be won.  I do not find it boring though it can be a faster play than most solitaire games.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I logged onto my facebook account because the game asked for it. After I logged into it, I couldn't go back onto the app! I tried shutting the kindle down 7 times and I still couldn't play it. Well, it would go to the loading screens in the beginning. Then 8-12 seconds into the game, it goes back to the home screen!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Alot of fun.  Can get to be addictive very easily! Good way to waste a little time while waiting in line.

0671027344|5.0|I bought this book after I saw the movie and I was not disappointed. Chbosky creates a story that resonates into the very soul of anyone who reads it.

B0046A9MRW|5.0|The plot of this story is one of the better plots Christie has come up with. The characters in the book as well are solid, especially the doctor's sister. Christie is at her best when describing the characters and it adds to the enjoyment of the book. Poirot is true to his character and while he doesn't necessarily play the main character, he is still at his best.
0765325950|5.0|I might quibble on some of the details of the series, but the ending worked how it should have been. It made me happy and sad in a number of ways and sometimes at the same time, but it was spot on.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I purchased this book for my 10-year old daughter. She devoured this book &#34;on the spot&#34; once she received it. According to her it is a very interesting story.<br />Thank you for providing so much entertainment for our family.
B0000A2I1B|2.0|Caravanserai contains none of the great rock rhythms that drove Santana's first 3 albums.  This is pretty much a jazz album.  The great melodies found in 'Oye Como Va' and 'No One To Depend On' are long gone, replaced by long jazzy instrumental numbers.  The few vocals you find here are poorly done.  As usual, the guitar work is excellent.  But without strong vocals, lyrics and melodies, this one falls flat.  This one is for Jazz lovers only.
B000FC10WU|5.0|What can one say?  It's Agatha Christie.  It's Miss Marple (though not as much of her as in some of the other Miss Marple books).  Thoroughly interesting.  Read closely for her clues to who dunnit.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was reluctant to get involved with a &#34;zombie&#34; series, assuming it would be cliche--and aren't we all sick of hearing about zombies, anyway?<br /><br />If you can stomach a little gore, it's well worth the watch. But it's not action and gore for the sake of it. The story takes top priority in the series. It's incredibly suspenseful, has plenty of twists, and excellent character/relationship, sub-plot development.  If I had to say a single bad thing about it, I guess there have been a few times when I noticed an obvious solution to a problem was not taken to move the plot in a certain, more dramatic, direction, but who cares. I still love it. And now after season three, I NEED to know what happens next!<br /><br />Watch it.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I pre-ordered this book, and was excited that Rowling had written something new. I quickly became disappointed with this book. The book takes way too much time to start to get interesting. There is way too much time spent on developing characters that, honestly, didn't need to really be developed. I found it laborious to read about the towns, and found myself wanting to finish the book just so it would be done. I can respect the detail that she put into the lives of the kids, and thought it was bold of Rowling to touch on such hard issues (especially with her fame being made on children's books), however, I don't feel that the book was as brazen as it should have (or could have) been. Rowling's message is lost in too many words, about too many things that weren't really important.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This has got to be one of the most fun, well written and exiting series of all. We can't stop watching it!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I loved this book; it definitely lived up to another Sophie Kinsella hit!  I've read all her other books and this one certainly lives up to expectations.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 remains one of my favorite RPGs.  The social interactions between characters, the combat, the level of customization you can perform with your party - it all comes together to make one hell of a game.  If you played the initial game on the PS2 you might be a little iffy to play the Vita version.  I played through the PS2 version but never finished it.  So, it was a no brainer to pick it up when it came out for the vita.  Even if you beat the game twice already there is enough new content and updated graphics to warrant another wallop through this wonderful world.  If you have never played the game before, prepared to be taken to the next level of RPG/social interaction gaming that to this day hasn't been matched.  I envy people new to the game because I would love to experience this magic over again for the first time.

B004VMVTNU|4.0|Alarm Clock Xtreme is great, but lately I've been very jealous of other alarm clock programs which have QR code support (so you have to go scan a code to shut down the alarm.). I tried unsuccessfully to switch to one, but I like Alarm Clock Xtreme too much. The ideal solution? If ALarm Clock Xtreme added QR code support! That way I get the alarm clock program that works best and the feature I'm jealous of!<br /><br />Allow me to hammer this point home, though, this is a great app. Allows total customization of your alarms.
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|This review will contain some spoilers. I'll try to keep them to a minimum.<br /><br />Zero Dark Thirty, Katheryn Bigelow's epic 2 hour and 40 minute film about the hunt for Osama bin laden, is first and foremost a procedural.  It's a painstaking, detached, nuts and bolts breakdown of the decade long search for bin Laden, complete with torture, suicide bombings, cloned cell phones, and a seemingly endless amount of dead ends and misinformation.  I like procedurals, but I love when a filmmaker can work in a procedural framework and give us fascinating characters at the same time.  That's not what we have here with Zero Dark Thirty.  The character at the center of the film, Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, is mostly a cypher.  The film is overflowing with excellent supporting character actors like Kyle Chandler, James Gandolfini, Harold Perineau, Jennifer Ehle, Edgar Ramirez, and Jason Clarke.  With the exception of Clarke and Ramirez, who do get interesting arcs, every other actors talents are wasted on what amounts to a token friend or incompetent superior archetype. But, that's not to say Zero Dark Thirty doesn't offer any pleasures.  Bigelow is an excellent action director, and there are a handful of exciting set pieces, including the raid on bin Laden's compound.  The story is truly fascinating and complex as well.<br /><br />I don't think I need to bother going over the plot here, because it's very complicated and most American's at least have a passing familiarity with it, so I'll dive right in to the characterization.  Maya is a young CIA agent who was recruited out of high school to work on counter terrorism.  There's a lot of implications about someone essentially forfeiting their youth to hunt terrorists, but those are scarily explored.  Instead Maya is simply a cypher used to deliver the plot to the audience.  She's given a revenge motive about half way through the movie, but again, her motives are fuzzy or ill-defined.  You could argue that Chastain's character is symbolic of America's drive and thirst for revenge, and I think that's a valid reading.  However, I don't think creating a character who's a living and breathing symbol of some abstract concept makes for good cinema.  There's need to be some sort of human element that makes a character more than a symbol, and I don't see that with Maya.  She's given a token BFF in Ehle's character, but there relationship is not explored at all except with a few brief glimpses.  So when Ehle's character is killed, I didn't really buy that Maya would be so broken up and hungry for revenge because of it.  The only real poignant character moment for Maya comes at the end, when she finally has to come to terms with what she's been doing her whole life.  It's quite a lovely scene.  It's too bad there weren't more like it.<br /><br />There's also little to no meat to the supporting characters either.  Kyle Chandler is an excellent actor but his Joseph Bradley is little more than a token superior officer.  Harold Perrineau has some chops as well, but it's not like he has anything to do really.  The two supporting characters I did like were Jason Clarke's Dan and Edgar Ramirez's Larry. Dan starts out as the head of detainee program, and has to come to terms with the horrible things he's been doing.  Larry is a CIA operative who helps Maya track down the couriers cellphone.  Ramirez brings a world weariness and practicality to the character that serves as a good counterpoint to Maya's single-mindedness.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't praise Bigelow's flair for action.  The major set pieces are up to her usual high standards.  The raid of bin Laden's compound is absolutely spellbinding and completely devoid of any glamorous touches.  The other big set piece, a suicide bombing on a military base, is fuzed with an incredible amount of dread because you see it coming from a mile away.<br /><br />The action sequences, the fascinating procedural elements, and Clarke's and Ramirez's characters make this worth watching.  I know I'm forgetting something..., oh right, there's torture.  What I do find troubling is that the film doesn't really make a judgement either way on torture.  I've never seen a movie portray a massacre or a some kind of war crime without making a moral judgement about it.  It fits with the detached tone of the rest of the movie, but it definitely serves as a lightning rod for controversy.  The movie claims that torture did yield some useful information but that information was redundant and what really lead to the big break was digging through a mountain of paper.  The current administration is on record as saying torture did not yield any useful information, so either the administration is lying, Bigelow was told something by someone in the CIA when doing research for this movie that said torture did yield pertinent information, or she deliberately changed the narrative to fit with her vision of the film.  I have no idea what the right answer is.  It's a thorny and difficult ethical question.  I personally think that film is not a reflection of reality, no matter what the trailers and press kits say about how realistic this movie is.  It's Bigelow's prerogative if she wants to portray torture as at least partially effective.  It opens a huge can of worms though.  You may get some useful information, but you also get a lot of incorrect information because the person being tortured will tell you anything to make it stop.  Is the information worth the price you paid for it?  I find torture absolutely reprehensible, and the movie shows torture are awful and dehumanizing, though somewhat effective.  It's basically an inkblot test on what you think about torture, and I'm not sure I get the value of something like that.  I wasn't around for the fervor over Straw Dogs and it's portrayal of a woman who appears to enjoy her own rape, but it asked some questions of the audience that made a lot of people uncomfortable.  Zero Dark Thirty does the same thing with regards to torture.
0786838655|5.0|Feature Films are created to properly depict the storyline to better enhance the viewer with a visual representation of the actual product that they are trying to visualize. Chris Columbus, bravely took the role of directing, \\"The Lightning Thief\\", however did the job poorly. Although in his defense it is not easy to emulate the book into a film. But the main problem was due to the fact that there were many things wrong with the movie. While the book entices its readers the film dissuades its viewers.<br /><br />There are many things that the book doesn't emphasize and there were many parts that were not the same. The first was the age difference between the real characters and the ones that were on screen. The age of Percy Jackson, the main protagonist in the book was 12 years while in the film it was 16. Another big difference was that the camp Half-Blood bully Clarisse, was not there in the film. I wanted to witness Percy drown Clarisse with the water from the toilet, when she tried to bully him for the first time. But unfortunately I didn't have the pleasure of witnessing Clarisse's pain that I so dearly enjoyed in the book. Another big difference was that Annabeth's family is not mentioned. Annabeth is Percy's best girl-friend who accompanies him on his quest to save the world.  I also felt that the characters were not as close. I didn't get as strong sense of a friendship as I had in the book. But maybe that could have been the fault of the actors and the lack of acting skills.<br /><br />Although the movie was not good, I cannot let that be the judge of the actual book and let such an injustice be done. When I first read the book, I got the sense of a small kid that felt lost. I felt that Percy Jackson was an average kid, however I had the foresight of the reader and I knew that he was destined to be great. I knew that he would be able to return the lost bolt of Zeus but I had no idea on the adventures behind it. It's always a treat when as a reader there aresurprises in the book. I think that it can be easily said that \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is one of the greatest books I read as a kid. I remember how I would always wait the following year for the next book and my friends and I would have a list ready of who would read it next. It felt good to own the book and let others read it. This book was my childhood book.

B007OLYPW2|5.0|I have owned this book since it was first published & had been waiting years to purchase it for my Kindle.  I read it every year.  It is an enchanting mix of love, mystery and history, blended (intentionally) with poetry and short stories...this is a HIGHLY literary book (no wonder it won the Booker Prize); if you are a casual reader who likes to skim fairly superficial fiction, it will most likely not appeal to you.  If, however, you enjoy settling in with a book and immersing yourself in wonderfully formed characters -- and are willing to take a side-trip with the poetry/short stories interspersed throughout (all of which are critical to the story itself) -- then this is the novel for you.  Love, love, LOVE this book.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|You can find different words I wish I could take this devise to school any body can take this book any were.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|It's a little sad, but also rather hopeful; incredibly well-written (won the Pulitzer Prize, deservedly so).  The three main characters are each compelling and sympathetic; you wont regret this purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this story, the best I have ever read in my life. To Suzanne Collins, and the greatest trilogy ever<br /><br />May the odds be ever in your favor...
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I was very satisfied with this item, will be a repeat customer for future items. Would recommend this item to anyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Couldn't put it down, will be reading the third book now. Probably not as good as the first. V b
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!<br /><br />At all.<br /><br />It is fraught with unsolvable problems<br />.<br />The app was not thoroughly tested first. After you invest countless cumulative hours into it, it just stops working.<br /><br />I have been in touch with the developers they promise to work on the flaws.<br /> They don't. But they admit that this game has problems.<br /><br />Don't be a test subject for them, do not spend any money on in app purchases.
031620157X|5.0|I bought this for my non-reader teen (13 year old girl) for Christmas. Tonight she didn´t want to come to dinner because she was so engrossed in the book. Thank you Chris Colfer!! Now she knows that a book can be just as interesting as Facebook!
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I kind of debated on whether to give it a 4 or 5, but decided that since it has messages in it that make the world a better place to live in, including: 1. you reap what you sow(it hurt him more by his brother dying and him being the culprit than him dying and main character gets violated in prison), 2. don't make debatable decisions that effect you perpetually(regretted getting that infamous chest tattoo later and there's a scene at his house that he later regrets), 3. find out if the rhetoric someone tells is true & act accordingly(accepted the racist babble that his dad tells him, but later when his mom's boyfriend/mom/sister were talking perfect racial sense to him--which he could not adequately refute, he still would not listen to them and became a rock of intolerance), 4. people are too unpredictable to try and control--esp when it is infamous control(things said and done can be taken in myriad of ways by this group of people or that group of people &, most of the times, these things can never be revisited in the ways in which one may later desire to; also, you can manipulate a person or group of people here or there, but not in every critical area--esp. what happened in the movie, people change while some do not within the same space of time), 5. They show you the faces of racism: the kind that young racists prefer(skinheads--rhethoric filled rants and violence); insincere racists(opportunists that were only concerned with how a certain group viewed them); and the kind that most of the middle-aged racist people and beyond prefer(master manipulation and systemic, upper level dehumanizing nonwhites). These things come to a head, when a &#34;prince&#34; without his subjects is put in prison and found--through some crude persuasion--that his lifestyle was a &#34;game&#34; and not indicative of how things mostly are. Sure, some--as what happened in the school with blacks attacking the white boy--happens, but it's not the mainstream and--even if it was--they were wrong and are going to have to pay for their choices just like Norton had to pay for his choices. It even took his dramatic prison story to convert his little brother, which is true to life when you have prideful individuals doing wrong(the process is usually not magically easy, but takes specificity if it will happen at all). This movie was very, very true to life; if a leader or prideful person is doing something wrong that he's very interested in, then it will either take a few big moments(as is the case with this movie) or smaller events over time(such as life maturing a person) to change them. Note: Not a movie to watch with kids--as it is visually true to life with the wording the characters use plus the actions that the characters performed; some movies you can ff past the bad parts and lock it away in your private stash--NOT THIS ONE, THOUGH--when you combine both words  and action, it's like Casino or Harlem Nights on steroids; be warned and be advised!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|You will love this movie.  I watched it twice and it was funnier the second time. The cast is awesome and very talented performing great tunes throughout the film.  Enjoy!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this series, never read the comics but I might just check them out now, oh wait i don't read comics.Great plot, characters ect, oh and lots not forget zombies
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|I just love this cinderella like story.  it is a feel good movie and Drew is just adorable in it.  It worth the time you spend watching it.  It is for all ages.  My granddaughters love it as much as I do.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I love the movie and the service , the movie looks great on blue ray. thanks a.gain,steven keep up the good work.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|Great read. Several parts of this I would love to see on film. I enjoyed the book a little more than the old film. My only complaint is that this book feels rushed while reading it and the ending is rather abrupt. But overall it's a great book and I will enjoy 're-reading it to my children.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was expecting more considering it has been a bestseller for so long. It was slow in the beginning, then picked up half way through. The book would've been much better if it had a more creative ending.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed the book. The characters are well drawn and by turns hilarious and heartbreaking. The ending was unexpected and really quite perfect.
B000B589JI|5.0|This is a great idea for the zippo hand warmer because you can always have extra fuel with you when you are out in the woods or at a game in the winter.  As always it is contructed very well.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was right in my wheelhouse. Well, maybe I was a bit too young to get some of the references. But I really appreciated the depth and breadth of pop culture knowledge the author put into this book.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Good book! It would have been fun if u could change the color and design of the bookmark though. Other than that great!
0345803485|1.0|...the fact that something this bad can be published, let alone become a bestseller.  However - more power to the author that can successfully sell!  (Stephen King once made a comment to the effect of not looking down your nose at any successfully published author.)<br /><br />However, read the other 1-star reviews.  Some of them are far better reading (and writing) than the book itself!  I especially like the ones that count the number of times annoying phrases are repeated :-) :-)  This book has gotten TONS of publicity in the media, so there's probably no real need to try to bias the rating with fake 5-star reviews, but if you read some of them, quite a few sound like fakes...  (Not to say that some aren't real, and that some people don't love this book, as hard as it is for me to believe that :-)<br /><br />Anyway, the meat of my review:<br /><br />The characters - BORING, trite, shallow<br /><br />The plot - was there one?  The people who are raving about the great story \\"arc\\" need to read more books!<br /><br />The setting - the Pacific Northwest?  If these characters are American, why do they use British words and idioms?<br /><br />The sex - For some reason I had associated the term \\"mommy porn\\" with some sort of watered down soft porn or romance novel.  It's not.  This is hard-core crude sex, crude language.  Are there readers who find this erotic?  20 or 30 years ago you could only read things like this in that sticky back room of the newstand, or in Hustler magazine.  And it's not very realistic - it made me wonder if the author ever HAD sex, but she has kids, so I guess so.  Heaven forbid some love-starved teenage girls read this and enter into a future relationship thinking that a guy that talks or acts that way is OK (or, for that matter, that their body will react as Ana's :-) :-) :-)<br /><br />The writing - Yikes!  The only GOOD thing about the sex scenes is that they mercifully break up the amateurish prose in between.  It's downright painful to read.<br /><br />Borrow it from the library if you (like me) feel that you must find out what all the buzz is about.  If you are a reader and accustomed to good writing, good luck getting through it...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I will definitely be reading this book over and over. After about 2 chapters, the story captivated me completely. It is not your typical teenage love story, that is for sure. I would definitely recommend this book :)
B005IZLPMY|5.0|MARVEL at the amazing studio that created this film. If you like Marvel movies, then this is certainly a must-see on your list. If you've seen The Avengers, this is a must-see. If you are a human being, this is a must-see.
0385535147|1.0|In the movie, \\"The Sixth Sense\\" (circa 2000, with Bruce Willis), the unexpected twist at the movie's end had many people re-watching the movie from a more informed perspective, to test the veracity of the movie's plotline and script. Well, after reading Grisham's \\"The Racketeer\\" over the holidays, I had a bit of extra time and went back and re-read the book, with a more informed perspective. Unfortunately, the book fails \\"The Sixth Sense\\" test - as the storyline demonstrates structural inconsistencies.<br /><br />The main protagonist in the book, Malcolm Bannister, is intentionally misleading to both the reader and the federal authorities - which is to be expected, since he is, after all, \\"the racketeer\\". Yet, we also find numerous instances where Bannister's private thoughts are intentionally misleading to the reader. This makes no sense on any level - is the reader to believe that Bannister is actually lying to himself in his unexpressed thoughts?<br /><br />In the author's note, Grisham compares himself to the \\"laziest of writers\\", and acknowledges that \\"Research, hardly a priority, was rarely called upon.\\" It would seem that Grisham's laziness extended beyond his aversion to research and also impacted the structural integrity of his writing. This is unfortunate, since I was a fan of his earlier works, but Grisham seems to have developed a disdain for his readers (as evidenced by his author's note alone) - leaving one to wonder who is the real \\"racketeer\\" - defined by Grisham as \\"...one who obtains money illegally, as if by fraud....\\".
B007KAJG3K|4.0|NO SPOILERS...enjoy<br /><br />If you've seen the first Sherlock Holmes of this particular series, then you may have been a little disappointed by the first one. I was; I thought it moved too slow and the character development, aside from Sherlock, was lacking.<br /><br />No complaints for any of the above in this new movie. The plot moves quickly and maintains interest throughout the entire film. If you like watching movies where you think you can predict the ending and then end up being completely wrong, this is the movie for you.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|I started not to watch this movie due to the odd title.  BUT, after getting into it, I had to watch until the finale!!  Highly recommended !!
B004SIP9U6|5.0|We've had this on VHS for so much time and viewed it so often, we wore it out!  The movie is intelligent, humorous and thought-provoking (re: social mores).  Can you wear out a DVD?
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Very imaginative !!  Bruce Willis shines !!  One of the best time travel movies since 12 Monkeys ! Good quality Sci Fi !!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|We find we're enjoying &#34;younger generation&#34; movies more than adult-themed offerings.  Hope Hollywood gets the message.  This movie was very entertaining as well as seriously informational.

B0059XTV4Y|4.0|I don't think this movie is for everyone but my husband and I liked it. Although, I think it helped that we knew a bit about the story of Wallis and Edward to begin with. I recommend watching [[ASIN:B000742G06 a movie about Edward & Mrs. Simpson]] before watching this. This movie is not shallow at all. In fact it is quite profound. There are 2 main characters - Wallis (past) and Wally (present). Wally is a woman in a bad relationship who was named after Wallis. She is obsessed with the story of Wallis & Edward as she desires the ultimate love that she thinks Wallis & Edward shared. The movie is very well filmed and the costumes, scenes and make up are a joy to look at. The actors do a great job. This is a sort of dreamlike artist film - it is not straight forward, fast-paced and doesn't have explosions. It is not the best film I have ever seen but is quite good. Even the special feature which includes Madonna was interesting. This is a story about love and life. Life is not perfect and neither is love. Another good artistic contribution from Madonna! Good job Madonna! :)
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|If there were a six star category, this book totally would be it!  Buy this book, you won't be sorry!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Started out strong. Liked the twist.<br />Could have developed more of the other characters and made somebody likable. Ending was weak.

B007712XAU|5.0|The best series on PBS !  So glad I bought the DVDs so that I can watch it over and over.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet is one of the Stones' best albums from the prime years of their career.  Along with Exile on Main Street, Sticky Fingers, and Let It Bleed, it is a core disc for any Stones fan and indeed any rock 'n roll fan.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|I absolutely love the show Boardwalk Empire and the Bluray High definition looks amazing, I am very happy with this product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book..story makes u want to keep reading. Reading the final one next.  Hope the ending is a good one.

B009SIE6AA|5.0|Christmas music in James Taylor's unique voice and style.  I've bought his music and listened to it since I first heard &#34;Sweet Baby James.&#34;  If you like James, you'll like this.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks. A must read for anyone who enjoys his writing like I do. This book won`t disappoint.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|So far this is the best game I have ever played! But when I first started playing the game I got to level 6andnthe whole game just restarted. But I have been playing for a while now and I love it! I play it so much to the piont where my kindle fire dies ahaha.Its a great time killer and you can do so much. Also on the kindle fire the only way to get off the game is to hittools then the little bar at the bitten pops up and you can get out without shutting the whole kindle down.  And this game runs off Internet and when I have only one bar of Internet it runs like I have four bars! Its Amazing!
B007FJFDXS|4.0|Great game that challenges you by only letting you see bits of the path to where you need to go to get to the next level.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Quick read and good for those who are shy or don't feel comfortable in new surroundings. Author hits the nail on the head with some very common-sense approaches to overcome one's angst in new environments.
B004LOJPLQ|5.0|Outstanding!  I really enjoyed this movie, what a great portrayal of a man's life. It was interesting to see the courage and determination that one man can possess.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I must say that this series surprised me. I thought it would be Twilightish but I was wrong. Yes, vampires and werewolves roam free but the writing is amazing and the whole production is simply amazing. I love every moment that I watch and I laugh, cry and morn with each character. Damon is my favorite as he is for many because of his wit and charm but also because he is seriously hot. But I love Damon for every reason and I couldn't imagin the show without him. So thank you to the writers, actors and whoever else supports the show and helps to make it great! Can't wait for more seasons to come!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It almost seemed like two different books. The first half is the fun love story of Sky and Holder and the second is of Sky's past and mystery. Both were great!! I thought it was beautifully written. I definitely recommend this book and author!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well done ending to the trilogy.  Ms. Collins is able to make this world she has created very believable and the characters easy to care about.  I liked that the events were never predictable.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I'm a HOG junkie and lately have enjoyed playing games that combine HO with puzzles.  This is a great game for both elements.  I haven't finished it yet but I'm already ready for the next one.  Thanks G5 for great games like this and otherwise.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Very well done period piece using an actual castle in England as the stage.  Brilliant!  Well acted, and addicting.  I watched it all in one sitting.
1609613937|1.0|It is just another stupid diet book. This author gives you the impression that you can eat all the starch you want.  It is just like all of the other diet junk books out there. Everything is in small portions, If I can do that and just eat small portions,what would I need diet books for.  Save your moneyand don,t buy any diet books because they are all the same.
014241722X|5.0|Liked the book and gave it to my grandsons for Christmas.  One (10) has decided to become an attorney.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Overall and enjoyable movie, however some things are not plausible especially towards the end. SPOILER ALERT: At the end when she finds the new pitcher at just the right time seems out of touch.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm addicted....it was supposed to be for the kids but I can't help it. Simple games but they definitely make u forget t the time. My kids love it too!!
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Really enjoyed Emmerich's vision and purity of it as the vision was seen to fruition through the various stages of its creation.
0140065342|5.0|Looking forward to reading this book as recommended by one of my bosses...<br />This got to me literally within a couple days of me ordering it!
B00884GR0W|4.0|havent played too much yet but im already enjoying it. there's a lot you can build but also a lot you can't.. unless you can build stuff that's not in the recipe book.
0425252868|5.0|This is a MUST for every WW II aviation buff!  It's so gripping that you will not be able to put it down!
B00846REIS|5.0|Wonderful start to what promises to be a great series. I loved the interaction between the characters and the suspense. When I thought I had figured things out, she would add a twist.<br />Loved the characters strengths and weaknesses. Loved Gideon and Eva. They were both strong enough to stand alone as characters and when they are together it is explosive.<br />I have read other reviews where they have cited that this is a copy of 50 Shades. I cringe when I read other reviews and there is a reference to that book. I did read it, and did fall to the hype of the book. There are similarities between the two series, in terms of set up, careers, love story...but that is where they end. The writing in this book was wonderful. Never dull, never repetitive and never made me feel like I was reading a book far beneath my reading level.<br />This books leaves you hungry for the next installment.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|The show draws you in and makes you want more.  I will be purchasing season two, for sure.  Can't wait.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn delivers again<br />I've found re-reading the previous novel from the prior year refreshes my Mitch Rapp 'dossier' and believe this is even better than 'American Assassin'<br /><br />As a fellow p-c survivor I can only say that Vince's prostate might have taken a hit but his novels still 'radiate' action while providing an insider's look into counter-terrorism<br />'A Must-Mitch-Rapp-Read'<br />McP

B008NEMPTO|4.0|I gave this movie 4 stars because the movie with the graphics and action was great, a bit scary with the vampires but otherwise a great movie!  It would have been 5 stars but for the movie dialogue of Abraham Lincoln being a Vampire Hunter...Really?  Otherwise the movie was great!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|THis book had me intrigued from the beginning. It has a great unexpected twist, and is a very enjoyable read.
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|The 3D graphics for this movie as well as the story line were great!  My 7 year old enjoyed it!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This by far is not only my son's favorite animated Christmas movie but mine and my wife's also.  The Blu-ray only makes it better giving an awesome picture and incredible sound.
B0013ND30M|4.0|I didnt remember much about this movie from when I was a kid but my daughter LOVES it.  I am glad I ordered it for her.  She is 3.5 and very into anything princess related.  You can tell that the movie was &#34;digitally remastered&#34; but adorable to watch.  You just can't go wrong with Disney.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Get this game it's not like the Xbox 360 also not like the computer it's WAAAAAAAY back in the updates (this is the second update ever!)but it is awsome because it has BUTTER!!!!(gold!)

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He's loved watching every CD.  Great gift for anyone who is into history.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to be wonderful in the Masterpiece Theater tradition!  The many plots, costuming and ongoing character development are excellent.
0141341416|4.0|was just what I was looking for I loved the way it came in the box and wrap I am very satisfied
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I can not download the latest update after removing and reinstalling evernote on kindle fire.  why cant i get the latest&iquest;
B0045XGRQE|3.0|I thought the movie was great overall but I also thought it was a little cheesy in some parts.  Robert Downey Jr. was great as usual but I did not like the fact that Don Cheadle replaced Torrence Howard.  Not sure why that was but I really dislike when they change out actors for the same characters.  I definitely thought the first one was better and I have high hopes for the third.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great little app. very slick and as accurate as anything i have found. it gets a lot closer to my actual location than the weather channel.
1577314808|5.0|I consider this book to be 5 stars because of the readability and the powerful message. I liked the question and response way of conveying the concepts and found the information easy to follow. I've been recommending it to many people.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Skip this one it's very dull, there is nothing very interesting in the story line I kept expecting something to happen but it's about boring people I just couldn't care about.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We both saw the movie in the theaters and loved it. It looks amazing in blu-ray and is a movie that we can watch over and over.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Still crying over this heartfelt, beautiful story. A definite must read for all. The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible story.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|I still remember being young and seeing this movie in the theater and buying all the awesome toys that came out with it. It is a great movie where I enjoy it as much as I enjoy the book! They did a great job with this one all the content is great!
B0084BMUFA|3.0|A Christmas Carol was an enjoyable short read. It was nice to read descriptions that all the movies miss. I will read it more than once.
B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|I bought this originally for my wife for Christmas and we have watched it numerous times. I won't spend time talking about the details of the movie or anything like that. But it has some excellent casting and an excellent story.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Where is the fire? These characters are exhausting... I am missing more of my favorites from previous books... Thank you for the first 4 books. I  happy to have enjoyed those
B0017APPT8|5.0|When we bought my in-laws a HD LED TV and blu-ray player we got this for my father-in-law. I have so many memories with this movie and when it was release on Blu-Ray I had to snatch it up for him. It looks great and sounds great and has some great content with it as well!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I am a BlackVeil Brides fan. I say i am a proud member of their army, but not amazon. I have been dying to get this and have yet to get it as of today. I have never had issues with amazon until now. First they send it back because of a proccessing error. It should have been here last Friday the 11th, now its the 14th and is promised to be here today. So far not here and I am a bit annoyed. I can't find a way to complain about this to the company personally, so here is my complaints. The product on the other hand is great from what i have been able to hear. I hope it gets here soon and when it does i shall seriously rethink ordering stuff from here again, at least around the holiday's.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|I bought this originally for my wife for Christmas and we have watched it numerous times. I won't spend time talking about the details of the movie or anything like that. But it has some excellent casting and an excellent story.
B008ROH07W|5.0|The incredible skill of Ms. Balsom is on full display in this recording.  It is hard to imagine the difficulty of playing the music with this instrument.  It is a thoroughly enjoyable recording.
B00164GDD2|5.0|I have so many memories with this movie and when it was release on Blu-Ray I had to snatch it up. It looks great and sounds great and has some great content with it as well!
B0042LJTQO|5.0|Mr. Brendel performs an excellent suite of Shubert's compositions.  The quality of the recording is exceptional  and it will be a frequent choice for listening.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|couldn't put it down. it was great to have on a day when I wanted to relax. would have loved for it to keep going...
B001EN71CW|5.0|So I am not going to waste time going over each episode or such. I am just going to state this is an amazing TV show with an incredible chemistry between the actors and such a great story line. It is a real shame that it was cancelled due to Fox messing around with the story line and re-arranging episodes to be more &#34;action packed&#34;. I love this show as well as many others!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book. Only thing I was disappointed in was the ending. Don't get me wrong the ending was good, just felt like it was a little to rushed and maybe missing something? All in all though I really enjoyed it, and loved the story line.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|We bought this for my father-in-law when we bought them a HD TV and blu-ray player for Christmas. He loves watching this movie and it looks amazing in Blu-Ray.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The book is fast paced easy to read and never has a dull moment.  If you are a fan of Clancy, you will not be disappointed.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This is an awesome movie. The first time I saw it in the theater was before I even saw Firefly the TV show. I was able to understand what was going on and it made me go buy the complete series on blu-ray and watched it from start to finish in a day or two. Great story and great actors!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My grandson loves the game as do I. I find myself wanting to play the game every time I have a few minutes to spare.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I bought this originally for my wife for Christmas and we have watched it numerous times. I won't spend time talking about the details of the movie or anything like that. But it has some excellent casting and an excellent story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My wife has this game on her Iphone, she seemed to play it eveytime she sat down, she loves it.
145210655X|5.0|I guess this book is intended for a younger set, but is funny for adults and poignant for anyone who has been around kids.  Our whole family got a kick out of it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Really good book, beyond sex scenes the story is amazingly thrilling. A lot of expectation across the length of the book, loving to follow the trilogy. Touching story.
B00A2FSSHK|5.0|Highly recommended for people that like action, sci-fi, intrigue movies.<br /><br />Have your favorite beverage and some popcorn handy.<br /><br />I would recommend it to a friend.
B009FZFONO|5.0|And the actors. This is one of two TV series I have found in years worth watching. Keeps me thinking.
0451197968|5.0|My very first thoughts when reading this novel was that Suzanne Collins must have also read it. I found myself constantly comparing The Running Man and The Hunger Games. While King's book is very much geared towards an older audience, there were still the general premise of reality television gone mad that is prevalent in Collins' book also.<br /><br />This novel gives the reader deliciously slow dribs and drabs of the dystopian world it is set in even if we are never really completely aware of the whole back story. The world that the main character lives in is bleak and he must decide to give his own life in the reality games shows designed to entertain the masses on Free-Vee in order to provide enough money for life saving medicine for his sick daughter.<br /><br />I couldn't help but compare the use of Free-Vee as a way to appease and control the general population with the internet usage of today. Also, anyone else remember their parents telling them that television will rot their brains? Yup, this novel is just as relevant today as it was back when it was written.<br /><br />King does a wonderful job of bringing the reader towards a climax that proves the must needed catalyst for revolution amongst the people. The reader comes to understand the fine line that authority holds when it controls its followers by fear. It only takes one small chink in it's armour to make everyone question what they are saying is the truth.<br /><br />As usual, King uses lush descriptives that at times make the reader squirm uncomfortably because of their brutal honesty. My favourite in this book would have to be:<br /><br />Spectators had begun to creep back in spite of Armageddon's shadow. Their eyes were wide and wet and sexual.<br /><br />Such a terrific way to describe the horrible (and curious) notion of having to look at a car wreck even when you don't want to see the accident.<br /><br />There are rarely happy endings with Stephen King. This novel is no exception and I was completely relieved there was no classic Hollywood ending for this book.<br /><br />Overall, I completely enjoyed this book. It had all the hall marks of great dystopia as well as the adult perspective that I find lacking in today's newer novels in this genre.<br /><br />It gets 5 out of 5 stars from me!mpletely relieved there was no classic Hollywood ending for this book.<br /><br />Overall, I completely enjoyed this book.

B000E33W1W|5.0|Such a great movie and glad to share it with my kids. Classic Murray/Akroyd and Weaver/Moranis combos.  Love the Stay-Puft marshmallow man! Occasional off-color language but doesn't ruin the movie by any means.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Good story, nice read. Not sure if I want to keep this series going. Reminded me of a Twilight wannabe - but a good one!
B003DTMUOE|5.0|Este libro debe de ser leeido por todos! La historia es facil y rapida de leer, con un mensanje super grandioso. Recomendado para todos.
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|Is it my imagination or does Season 3 appear to be stuck in the mud?  I'm rather appalled that Mary's whole focus is getting Matthew's money just to invest in a lifestyle that is outdated and archaic... Maggie Smith still delivers the best lines with panache.  Shirley McLaine was a huge waste of time despite the glowing reviews.  And goodness, Edith once again gets the short end of the stick!  Perhaps Dan Stephens saw the writing on the wall and jumped ship at the end of this eason...
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Half way through it, but it is very well researched and written, plus a good story telling.  I do recommend it!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This trilogy was amazing, it came in great condition and I would definitely recommend this to any huge Batman fan out there
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This case is attractive, sturdy, comes in an assortment of colors and a great case for the price. I would recommend it.
B005LAIHSG|2.0|way to dark for my teens to watch. this movie is very gritty and not what i expecped. but as will all things it was made to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy.  I found the first two books to be interesting, thought provoking and entertaining.  I was kind of skeptical about the third installment but I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading other works by this author.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|As noted above, this is our third monitor (mobi cam & baby ping were returned). All of the glittery features of the Withings monitor are on par & function effortlessly with our iPhones & iPads. The video/audio has a 1/2-1 second delay but its rather unnoticeable. We live in a high rise so you can imagine the interference one could expect yet this monitor performed beautifully when I tested it out 9 floors up at another mums house. She loved it too! Looking forward to the security and flexibility of the Withings monitor once our baby is born...I promise, you won't be disappointed either.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Interesting story line and good graphics. Not too far in yet, but so far it has run well on my kindle fire hd. I think it's worth paying for.
B0090EJR1K|1.0|An awful effort by the here-to-fore brilliant Cohen, vulgar and not particularly funny. South Park any episode is funnier in the first 2 mins.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I would rate this 3 1/2- almost 4 stars, not sure if it was quite good enough for 4 stars. I think the movie is purposely cheesy, but met my expectations of a MIB movie. Definitely more of a kids movie.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I don't go much for movies with any violence, but having been a fan of the old Planet of the Apes way back I had to check it out.  It did not disappoint.  Good story line and plausible with the way we humans are evolving these days.  Worth the watch.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was really fun and funny. I saw it in theaters with my friends and still was willing to pay to watch it again online. I will say that at some points, I got a little bored but overall, the hilarious characters kept me entertained. Especially Fat Amy, she has to beone of my favorite characters in the entire movie.
B006MQRLSA|2.0|Was it just me or did it seem like Brad Pitt was just walking around a movie set talking?  I could not focus on the story (not that it was a riveting storyline) for always noticing the poor acting by Mr. Pitt.  Me thinks the fellow is perhaps over-rated -- at least in this movie.  His non-acting was such a distraction that I really got little from the movie at all.
B003G4W49C|5.0|An intellectually gripping fantasy, beautifully worded. Card paints a picture in your mind that takes you through space, time and the human condition so well that you're bummed to snap back to reality when you finish reading.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|Quite a movie.  Not the usual at all.  Awonderful unfolding of a young man into all he wishes to become -- falling into the consequences of his life decisions.  Moving.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I've seen a lot of negative reviews on how it costs &quot;real&quot; money to play. I suppose these people didn't actually take the time to learn the game. While you can opt to pay for coins and diamonds, they are easily earned for free. It all comes down to patience.  If you want to play this game for hours on end, your only option would be to purchase more diamonds and gold. However, if you play for roughly 30 minutes once or twice a day, you will easily be able to wait for your energy to restore itself, therefore, earning more energy, which in turn, leads to earning coins by searching through rooms, which ultimately, builds your experience to  level you up and earn more diamonds. I like the game a lot. I don't have time to play any game for more than 30 minutes.... I have a real life too. But I'd say this one is worth it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|keeps u busy n passes the time good game or games I should say.some of them can take lil time to.I like the diffrent skill levels
B005SMUW8U|1.0|I had a friend years ago,recommend that I get one of Tom Waits' CDs.At a local Harmony House I bought one.I can't exactly remember the name of it,but oh my heavens it was absolutley ear-aching! Right after the first song,I turned it off and tried to take it back.Unfortunatly,the store would not return it,because it was opened.I was so ticked off.My \\"friend\\" who recommend the Tom Waits CD to me has been missing ever since,I confronted him about it. ...moral of the story,don't ever waste your time listening...let me rephrase,TRYING to listen to Tom Waits.
B00005U122|4.0|The region code was incorrect for my area (South Africa), so it didn't play on certain DVD players. That said the DVD was exactly what I was looking for.
B006ZCWTV0|1.0|I can't believe this old fart is still trying to \\"rock\\". He never COULD ROCK as far as I'm concerned.Bruce Stringbean could never sing or do anything else for that matter. This dude is without a doubt,THE MOST overrated \\"artist\\" of all time.It's a shame so many other groups and/or artists never got the full respect that they deserved,such as ELO,Robin Trower,or Men At Work,among many others...but this grungy looking twit gets the nickname \\"The Boss\\"?! Wtf is up with that? Anybody that's got any taste at all wouldn't give this guy one cent of their money.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Just like the handheld book but where's Fregly's letter to Ruby Bird? I mean really that was in the paper version
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The Bourne Legacy. I liked the movie but the format was narrow with a black band at top and bottom.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Alright, kinda skipped off on the Romans. But overall it was pretty good I've read every book and it just has me hooked.
034580404X|5.0|It was a very easy read and I enjoyed it very much. It kept me wanting to read moreand more. Could not put down.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awsome I loved it I could not believe it was that good I loved the other books but this was great way better than the other books so I hope you come out with another book soon ps think of a new title of the next one
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love this app.  It keeps me up to date on my news and all'  I recommend this app! &#60;3
B005USZML4|4.0|Enjoyed the boy wonder lawyer adventures.  Fun, easy, and a quick read.  Filled with likeable characters in a small town setting.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Streaming was bad when watching movie, so I lost interest in it. However I think it was an ok movie, one I would watch with my grandchildren.
B0060AY85C|2.0|This is only 1 of 2 Toni Morrison books I have ever finished. Reading should be fun, but she just makes me work too hard to understand what she is writing about. This was a fellow book club member's selection and it took me the entire 5 weeks to read it. I kept putting it down and reading something more enjoyable.  I did finish it. Sorry to all my friends who love her work. I'm still not a convert.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was hooked from the very start. Great characters. Interesting story. Awesome book. Looking forward to the movie. The only question on my mind is...Why didn't Pi Patel tell anyone about his diary? It was the only proof that Richard Parker was indeed on the the lifeboat and he was not alone. But all in all, GREAT BOOK, GREAT READ.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Purchased this book based on recommendations posted on Goodreads. I really enjoyed this author and the premise of the story. I plan to read the next book in the series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was so amazing! I'm sad that reading it is over, but I'm also excited to see the coming up movies!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have fun with Pinterest. Unfortunately, I can quickly lose track of time looking at other boards and finding things to pin.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love sharks I amit it I love sharks and this game has it all and it has plenty of charm any I though that now that we know what they look like they should add the giant sqwid but all and all it is a excellent game for graphics and game play.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Another great album by Mumford & Sons.  I loved Sigh No More, and Babel has lived up to my expectations.  I think as I listen more I will find some other great anthems on par with &#34;Little Lion Man&#34; and &#34;The Cave.&#34;
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a really good book, I love it when Greg goes to the dance and it becomes a disaye
B009A87X80|5.0|It seems as though Eva is still with us. Her voice and presentation are those of an angel. God bless, Eva Angel.
0765325950|5.0|Just finished, finally the end of the series, sad, but did I say great ending? I loved it, read Brandon Sanderson's blog. He sort of tells you which part RJ wrote.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|IMHO:<br /><br />Some very small spoiler alerts are included.<br /><br />Pete Townshend did not write Who I Am for his fans, he wrote it for himself and the money.  He has a history of writing about his personal demons to exorcise them from his soul in his journal.  This seems to be cathartic for him.  He did say he had been keeping a journal for most of his life. When he went to therapy, he wrote more and more in his journal as part of that therapy.<br /><br />Being the private man he seems to be, I think he took care to remove  most of the personal feelings from of his journals, and put it out as an autobiography.  For example, when Keith Moon raised such a fuss at the airport during a tour, word got around to every airline, and no airline would permit The Who to fly causing  the band to hire a private plane to get them from one gig to the next to complete the tour.  This raised touring costs to the point where The Who either broke even or actually lost money on that particular tour. Townshend never tells us how he or any of the other band members felt  or said about that incident. To most readers, that can be quite frustrating. Perhaps that is why so many people are disappointed with this book. This kind of thing happens over and over again.<br /><br />I could have easily lived without the temperance lecture that seemed to come out of the deep blue sky.  Sorry, I simply don't believe his story about his  excessive sensitivity to alcohol after he quit. When he was given a Rolling Rock (c) and told it was \\"near beer\\",  He said after one sip he was afraid of going on an alcoholic bender, for he claimed to feel drunk instantly after the first sip.  I've seen bottles Rolling Rock (c)  beer, and it clearly states on the bottle that it indeed contains alcohol. I do think the man can't resist reading everything from  Shakespeare to a beer bottle. (33) ;)<br /><br />I also feel he may have wanted to demythologize himself. Mission accomplished there. This book reads like adeposition of a man trying to hide his feelings. These  feelings would have added so much depth to this book. Most of what we got were names and dates and events, but no feelings. He also did a good deal of name dropping, such as Jim Marshall, Dolby etc.  \\" Stop tryin'  to make me real\\" should be the title of this book, for Pete Townshend very rarely \\"betrays what he thinks\\".
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I asked her if it was what she wanted and she said, yes, and was very pleased with this version.
B008Y7CY00|3.0|Started out slow, real slow but it ended up pretty good. Overall I would recommend it if you like movies with time travel.
B000QUCNXG|4.0|I always enjoy reading about a culture with which I am not familiar.  I also liked the way the book was told in first person-refreshing.
B00008J2PG|2.0|I love Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer, but they seemed to be sleep walking through their parts.  Peck seemed to forget his Irish accent in some of the scenes.  Also, if you are taking allied troops across Rome, wouldn't private transport be safer?  Some of the scenes just didn't create the drama intended.  I just can't recommend this movie.
B008ENA74E|5.0|For someone within the mutual fund industry, this book was very entertaining,educational, thought provoking and a great reminder why we are all in this business. Well done.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It is okay. The game was a bit confusing at first but as I began playing it I understood it better. Still don't completely get it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|The movie is action the entire time. I never felt like I was getting bored. That's a great sign of a fun movie.<br /><br />Yes, there were plenty of unbelievable moments. The plot was holier than the pope. But unless you need intellectual stimulation from a movie, relax. Enjoy the ride. Have some fun.<br /><br />The cast speaks for itself and the players do quite a bit of playing, which is a good thing. The plot is fun to think about.<br /><br />Well worth it if you like the cast, and want to relax with a perfect friday night or saturday morning movie.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I enjoyed Rowling's writing; her vocabulary and ability to set the scene or mood is entertaining.  But her miserable people in their miserable lives wore me down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased these after reading positive reviews and the &#34;preview&#34; knowing nothing anything of the author or subject matter. They are awesome. Hugh Howey is a great story teller. Much like Isaac Assimov and I, Robot, Wool is a very possible near future scenario. There should be another writting classification, &#34;Plausible Non Fiction&#34;.  Now I've purchased First Shift, Second Shift, I, Zombie and will work my way through any and everything Hugh Howey has written. Excellent, excellent. I've been recommending Wool to everyone I know.<br /><br />Oh, and the price?! So inexpensive that even if you don't like them, but you will, it isn't a big investment.
B005HSL626|4.0|this is a relaxing game to play i like that i was able to get it free that way if i did not like it would not have cost me any money
B004DM0UII|4.0|Don't much about all the flap about the permissions, but this one does not push a bunch of adds like some radio apps or freeze up like others I have tried.
034580404X|3.0|bought this set for a gift, cheaper than most places and she loves them. Nice size to carry around in your purse, if you have a larger purse.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love epic series like these and after  a storm of swords, I felt feast for crows would be the \\"lull book\\" where not much goes in the way of action, but lays some rather droll groundwork and begins tying up loose ends in order to begin finishing the series. I was pleasantly surprised that this installment was riveting  and kept me turning pages for hours on end. While not all characters were presented in this part of the story, the new additions served the purpose of not only showing you a new facet of the ongoing War of the 5 Kings but are also essential to the development and storytelling of the existing characters. If you  pay close attention, you can read between the lines as  to what is going on with the left out characters. Some get what's coming to them, others are about to, some are working on redemption, and then there are those that leave you hanging. I'm glad Martin decided to break this part of the story into two volumes, I was just about crazy trying  to keep his characters and worlds straight as it was. KUDOS for the family trees!
B008QP3ZYE|3.0|I won't prattle on because much of what is in the other reviews is accurate, but I do need to chime in on the narration-- it is the only reason this doesn't getting 4 or higher star rating.  It sends me over the edge after too long, and I have to fight hard to tune it out.<br /><br />Please, someone from some other country re-narrate this film!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John has such a way with words, he can make you feel hopeful and utterly hopeless all at once.  This story is no exception.  The story of Hazel and Augustus will make you question everything you ever believed. Maybe not question, but certainly reevaluate.
B00884GR0W|1.0|This game is unplayable on a phone. Very long load times, choppy frame rates, and imprecise game controls.<br />I don't have a tablet, so I can't say if it plays better on them.
B006TLFPKO|1.0|Thank god I didn't rent this. It was on Showtime and I was curious.<br /><br />Wow! The WORST movie of all time! The only thing missing from Pattinson's horrific make up job is the big red rubber nose. Stewart cannot act her way out of a paper bag. Basically the studio could save millions by just using cardboard cut-outs of Pattinson and Stewart and using voice over. Cardboard has more personality.<br /><br />Dragged out, grossed out by the longest at-the-altar kiss ever. Jeez, you two, GET A ROOM already! The honeymoon scene? Silly as hell. If I was that in love with someone we'd be ripping off our clothes as soon as we got to the honeymoon suite, but Bella just puts it off, puts it off until it's funny. And the thrashed bed after the consumation? Well, seems as if both of them should have been on the floor or under the bed, but she's still in the same place she started out. This is one of those movies you have a party for, get smashed, and laugh your head off.<br /><br />The birth scene was sickening, for Christ's sake, chewing the baby out of her. Bad editing, I thought for a second there were TWO babies. I stopped watching there, don't care how it turned out. Our culture is determined by what we find entertaining. We're in BIG trouble!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|fun, good difficulty, well worth the money, g5 has yet to disappoint with their games. keep up the good work.
B00846TTDG|3.0|not the greatest war movie not the best it was just alright. would not realy rent it again if given to me as a gift ok thats it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game reminded me of a mixture of the old ISpy books and a facebook game. Each room requires energy, which is limited to a certain amount per level, BUT you can buy items with diamonds to get more energy. Except you need the diamonds to also unlock new rooms, and you don't get diamonds that often. But you can add friends and get things that way or you can put real money into the game. It's alright, but it gets tedious.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I l found the story  very interesting and enjoyable to read I can't wait till I go and see the movie
B005VTS4EY|5.0|i enjoy games that take thinking and logic, rather than speed. This game fits the bill, although some of the screens do require that you act immediately.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read several books on this subject -  but this one was different in that it was written by a neurosurgeon.  Just when I started to doubt again,  Dr. Eben Alexander III helped me remember Who I Am!  Thank you for courageously sharing your experience with us to uplift, love and comfort us all.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This is full of campy, comedy fun and great music; who could ask for more? I have never seen the stage performance but the movie is an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Clint Eastwood can pull off irreverence will still being endearing, sort of.  The story was well developed and the characters didn't get overly deep, emotionally.  A nice change from the usual relationship-expose of the day.  Enjoyed.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This movie is fantastic, and in it's native digital HD format, it looks and sounds gorgeous. A must-have for movie lovers, especially Pixar aficionados.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I just rewatched this movie. Haven't seen it for years. What a JOY--AGAIN. The BRILLIANT ACTING--GEORGE CLOONEY (HE has the capacity to be so wonderfully self deprecating), JOHN TURTURRO and TIM BLAKE NELSON--all of them could not have been more PERFECT. They are all BRILLIANTLY HILARIOUS. Ultimately, this story is a take off on HOMER'S ODYSSEY, and the COEN BROTHERS work this so well. The SOUNDTRACK in this movie is soooo perfect. BLUEGRASS--and done so very famously well. (Bluegrass is far from my favorite, but as in Bonnie and Clyde, this soundtrack is a large part of what makes this movie so great) I LOVE THIS MOVIE.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|This movie is fantastic, and in it's native digital HD format, it looks and sounds gorgeous. A must-have for movie lovers, especially Pixar aficionados.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My husband & I did not watch this on TV when it first aired.  Our friends raved about it and we bought this set.  We are hooked!  Thanks, Amazon for the fast service.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|You would not believe that this movie is 18 years old... it looks amazing. A must-have for movie lovers, especially Pixar aficionados.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|I think this movie might have been overrated. Maybe my expectations were too high? It was cute and entertaining(ish), but a little slow and long toward the end. I've heard lots of people say it was &#34;the best movie of the year.&#34; It wasn't bad, but it did seem to try really hard to be artsy or different or something. Just okay, in my opinion.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas and we have made four recipes from here already.  All three were very good and the recipes are quite easy to follow.  We have been avid followers of her blog so we knew what to expect but it is so nice to have it in book form; plus there are special recipes that are not on her blog in here.  The photography is gorgeous, and even when ours don't turn out quite AS pretty, they are still really flavorful.  It has a good diversity of types of recipes, and the dessert section is big (as it should be ;)  I would recommend this to any of her followers, but more so to those who just like good food and like to cook.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Quality was great. Still much to overpriced for just a 24 hour rental. Would only use service again if my local video store didn't happen to have whatever movie I was searching for.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My husband and I both are hooked on this game.  I don't understand why but there it is.  It keeps you entertained and even thinking!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I wasn't familiar with Flipboard....my wife mentioned it in passing.  Turns out to be the best app I've loaded on my Kindle.  Keeps me up to date on a variety of topics, keeps me connected to my social feeds and is easy to navigate.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion Bible has so many translation versions you can read your scriptures any way you like and compare wording for increased study and understanding. I really like the daily scripture and the reading plans as well. Very easy to use and find the scripture you want quickly.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Love this show.  The show is dark at times and at times hilarious.  I got addicted on the first episode and have been hooked since.
B005CRQ4OW|3.0|I found it hilarious. However i'm not sure it is suitable for my seven year old. Maybe when he is 12? I don't want him thinking like this. But as an adult thoroughly enjoyed it :-))
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good puzzle game. Have enjoyed playing. Don't like the attempt to sell me other games between rounds. Would be 5 stars without that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is one that has been awaited for centuries.  To think that it used to be hard to have a Bible translated into a language and now we have an app that we can choose a language or version to read is astounding.  I think that this app should be top on every Christ-followers device.  A way to have the Lamp unto our feet and the Light unto our path.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Easy to install, works well, doesn't add alot of bulk or weight, inexpensive. The stand up part isn't that firm.
B0049A9BSY|5.0|I think the reason why this film is so successful is because it taps into people's psyche of wanting to be rich, glamorous and sexy high fliers.<br /><br />You'd have to be top of your field to live like these ladies - dazzling wardrobes and posh apartments. And they are in jobs to die for. Carrie's a writer, Samantha's in PR and Miranda's a lawyer.<br /><br />Sex And The City 2 opens with an over-the-top gay wedding with Liza Minnelli doing a sizzling version of Beyonce's Single Ladies, moves on to Carrie's and Mr Big's lifestyle adjustments and then flies you off to Middle East with the four girls. Along the way expect plenty of fashion parades - the movie does not hold out on these! Watch Carrie go flea market shopping in Abu Dhabi with THAT skirt!<br /><br />This is a light hearted romantic comedy cum chick flick cum fashion show plus holidays in exotic locations. While the characters have relationship issues that people can identify with, it does not aim to address the more serious problems faced by ordinary folk.<br /><br />Penelope Cruz, Miley Cyrus and Tim Gunn make cameos.<br /><br />If you want to buy this, then get the 2 Disc Special Edition which is packed with six enjoyable extra features.<br /><br />My picks:<br /><br />The Men Of Sex And The City: Michael Patrick King and Mario Cantone discuss the dishiest. Highly hilarious and sexy.<br /><br />Marry Me, Liza! Behind the scenes with Liza herself!<br /><br />Revisiting the 80s: Samantha in Whitesnake trousers and Carrie in Madonna's Like A Virgin and Flashdance ensembles.<br /><br />My version is edited to meet censorship guidelines. So can someone kindly tell me what hot scenes I'm missing?
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I know where I've been, I now have a much better understanding for where I want to go from here.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was refreshing to read the original. great price on Kindle. There are so many movie versions out there that it was great to get more details and probe my imagination more than the visual screen
1416583408|3.0|I saw the author on tv and, being a dog-lover, purchased the book.  It's an okay book; however, probably overrated.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not the BANG I was expecting but a good, realistic finish to the series.  Worth the read. Great for reading on my Kindle.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I enjoy these type of games often. I just wish you didn't have to pay for the second half. other then that it is a decent game.
B0043GAZYS|3.0|Bought this new and on the day it arrived I tried to get the digital download only to be informed it is unavailable. As they dont include a disk, there is no recourse other than ripping the movie to the format I need by hand.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|I havn't seen this film since I was a kid in the early 90's, and it was just as good now as it was then. This version includes the theatrical feature + an additional disc allowinf for digital copy. No DVD included, and very minimal. I had hoped that there would be more special features. Especially, the making of. Besides that, it was real nice to visit this artsy classic about a detective singlehandedly taking on the mob. I love the cast and I love the whole comic feel. This is definitely a &#34;must-have&#34; for anyone's collection.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the series. Holding my breath for the last one. Similar but better story line than 50 Shades. If you liked 50 you will love Crossfire series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|My 13 year old loves all of these movies and she had to have this one. I found it online at amazon and it was brand new and much cheaper than in-store retailers.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A guy I work with recommended Evernote to me, and at first I didn't like it,but after using it for a week for everything, I began to see all its benefits.
1451648537|5.0|Isaacson's portrayal of Steve Jobs is incredibly inspiring. As you might suspect, Jobs was not a perfect man and made great sacrifices to accomplish all that he did in life. However, greatness often requires the focus and clarity to say \\"no\\" to so many parts of your life. This book is not only an insight into the life of a great man but also into the building of a great company. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with ambitions.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book proved me that I don't think correctly about money,<br />It opened my eyes and showed me that I am doing a lot of mistakes.<br /><br />I now analyse my financial status better.<br /><br />This book will definitely change my life for the better.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|As he is in every movie, Jeremy Renner was fantastic! I loved this movie and I really think it appeals to every audience as it was a movie that both my brother (17 years old), my grandfather (70's) and I (21 years old) could watch together and enjoy!
B006ZZANDI|5.0|I bought this CD in late August after giving in and asking my friend for song recommendations of theirs. While waiting for money to finally get their 2nd album as well, I listened to this CD all day and all night to the point I memorized the order of every single song on it (and I don't usually do that). And still today I haven't gotten tired of it, it's just so catchy. The only reason I haven't listened to it lately is because I finally got the 2nd album.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />1. What Makes You Beautiful - Whether or not you like it, you know this song. The lyrics are a little iffy in my opinion. \\"When you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell you don't know you're beautiful. That's what makes you beautiful.\\" Weird lyrics or not, the song is incredibly catchy and will make you dance (the first few times anyway :P).<br />2. Gotta Be You - I always skip this track. Not because it's terrible, but because I watched this YouTube cartoon (The Adventurous Adventures Of One Direction? Maybe you've heard of it?) and it made me not be able to take the song seriously.<br />3. One Thing - The 2nd single on the album. All about how the person they're singing to has one thing that they need, even though they have no clue what that \\"one thing\\" is. Extremely catchy.<br />4. More Than This - 2nd ballad on the album. I love this song b/c their voices really shine and the lyrics are probably some of the best lyrics on the album.<br />5. Up All Night - This is THE dance song on the album. I can never not dance to it. It's the catchiest and always puts me in a better mood once I listen to it.<br />6. I Wish - Probably the most forgettable song on the album in all honesty. It's all about how they see their love with someone else and keep wishing it was them.<br />7. Tell Me A Lie - My favorite on the album. They're trying to convince themselves that their love is leaving them for a reason other than \\"I found someone else\\", even though they know in their hearts that's the real reason.<br />8. Taken - \\"Now that you can't have me, you suddenly want me.\\" Kind of whiny and it's pretty much a Liam solo piece (with Harry on the chorus and Zayn on the bridge) but still pretty.<br />9. I Want - The lyrics to this are pretty bad (\\"Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say 'I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy'\\") but if you just focus on the tune, you will be dancing so much you forget about the lyrics hopefully.<br />10. Everything About You - The 2nd most dance-y song in the album (next to \\"Up All Night\\" of course). They're telling their love that the reason they want to be together with them is because of EVERYTHING about them, not just one specific reason. A really cute song.<br />11. Same Mistakes - The fan favorite ballad on the album, and it's really deserving of that title. The lyrics are all about how they realize they're doing the same things over and over again and that can only lead to the same terrible ending they've been having but they don't know what else to do to make it right.<br />12. Save You Tonight - \\"IIIIIII, I wanna save ya, wanna save your heart toniiiiiiight. He'd only break ya, leave ya torn apart, oh.\\" Aren't those gorgeous lyrics? They really speak to me. Yeah, okayyyy 1D. / However, the tune is really catchy and this track is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated on the album.<br />13. Stole My Heart - This on the other hand is one of, if not the most, overrated on the album. People act like this song is the most gorgeous piece in the universe and I like it, but it's definitely not as good as it's hyped up to be. That said, good song, just not as good as fans are making it sound.<br />Bonus tracks!:<br />14. Stand Up - Extremely dance-y and catchy. Compares their love to a stand up/robbery (\\"You can call me a theif, but you should know your part. I'm only here 'cause you stole my heart\\").<br />15. Moments - Possibly the best slow song on the album. I mainly only got the deluxe version so I could ownthis song. Everything about this song is beautiful. From Liam's opening \\"shut the door, turn the lights down\\" to Zayn at the bridge \\"as I feel myself fall, make a joke of it aaaallll\\" this song is just one of the best songs you could ask for. I don't think anything could be done to make it better.<br /><br />As for the \\"yearbook\\", well, I won't lie, I was kind of disappointed when I opened it up and there were barely any pages. The pages there were were mostly facts I already knew and pictures I'd already seen.<br /><br />However, I'm glad I got it b/c the bonus tracks and owning this beautiful sounding album made it worth the lame \\"yearbook\\". Pick up this album if you haven't already. You won't regret it.this song. Everything about this song is beautiful.

0765325950|5.0|I waited a long time for this book, it was worth the wait. I  can't  put it down. The whole series is a must read
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've read every book Rick Riordan has written. This is the best one yet. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
0553106635|5.0|This is one of my favorite reads. I was disappointed when I moved, and found out I  misplaced two of my books. I was  so glad I could still get them,( first and third) wanted to read again. these are books you will read again and again.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|If you can endure the filthy language throughout this book, it gives a lot of good information about the SEALs and especially the UBL mission.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I have selected a few favorites, some international stations included. I just push shuffle, and take my music motivation from room to room.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I really love the theme song to the latest Bond movie. I only wish it had been included as part of the entire soundtrack.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I love this game! It's the perfect build-it town game: however, it's missing a nice &#34;sandbox&#34; mode with no tasks to complete.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Quick read, good book. I thought it was a great book. It is as if it was written by a dog.
B0018STVHQ|5.0|This is my all-time favorite chick flick that I will always purchase as new platforms come out. Some say they have a problem with the acting, but I think it's a wonderful movie.  The movie is not considered historically accurate; neither is the book it is based off of. If you're not a historian, that shouldn't be a problem for you. Personally, I'm fascinated by Anne Boleyn and love any fictitious or historical story written about her. I enjoy Natalie Portman as Anne; however I craved the flirtatious and witty intelligence Phillipa Gregory portrayed in her novel, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl.\\" This adaptation of the book falls very short; nevertheless, it's still a good flick.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|My wife loves it, what can I say...six teen more word required to complete this items review and I think I over shot it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My family loves this movie and we watched it several times over the holiday break. The Avengers is one of the best super hero movies ever.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|This movie is terrible. In a cast of stars and studs, the story follows two of the worst actors I've ever seen. The girl can sing but can't act. The guy can't sing and can't act. Don't ever watch.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|If you like tower defense games, this is your dream game. best game ever!! cant stop playing it its amazing
0765325950|4.0|So glad Sanderson was able to tie up over 20 years of amazing stories, despite a ridiculous overuse of the word \\"tempest.\\" Sounds like a strange thing to complain about but read the book and you will understand.
B005D51II0|5.0|The item in question arrived on time and has performed as expected.  The sound quality is outstanding and the packaging is very well laid out.  An excellent buy.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved this book, so touching and heart filling. I couldn't put it down! I'll probably read it again in the future.
B00006B1HH|5.0|grease good cd fast fast service thank you this movie over  30 yrs old my 19 year grandaughter seen this movie and love it thanks again
B007SGM084|5.0|nice story.<br />the chracters are ceazy of course but its very fluent to red and there's a lot of sex in very fine detales
B00A2FSXHK|4.0|Very creative futuristic sci fi thriller.  I always like to see how some directors picture the future and Spielberg always delivers.  His ideas about how people are tracked in the future and how cars may function and the way he presents everything down to the last detail are all plausible and seamless.  I enjoyed watching this movie for the third time and will watch it again in the future.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very well done novel.  I truly enjoyed every minute of it, which was a surprise for me as I tend toward the more lighthearted mystery novels.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Great writing as usual, the plots are so good and the ending always surprises you.  I just read the Black Box, can't wait for his next book .
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|I agree with many critics that &#34;TheExpendables 2&#34; is what &#34;The Expendables&#34; should have been. Fun, tongue-in-cheek dialog filled with self-deprecating, pop-culture and co-star teasing remarks, combined with silly, over-the-top violence. It's a great popcorn movie!
B0098460O4|4.0|Love it. Didn't give it 5 stars because it is a bit short. Still I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music.
B009HELT3C|4.0|When this movie was in theaters, my 20-something son avoided this movie like it carried an infectious disease. He was disappointed in MIB2 and had heard some negative comments about MIB3. My wife & I first saw it in a theater and enjoyed it.<br /><br />Recently we had company over and my son wound up watching it with all of us on amazon streaming. My wife & I enjoyed it as much as our 1st viewing, and our son really liked it. Good, fun and frequently funny dialogue. Josh Brolin really becomes Tommy Lee Jones. Decent story.<br /><br />It's a better sequel than MIB2.<br /><br />A good popcorn movie.
6304765231|1.0|When we received the disc..it was not in it's secure packaging slot in the container box and had scratches on it.  The widescreen format did not work correctly either.  It was a small box framed version....<br /><br />Although we have purchased many items thru amazon..this one was a dud!  We returned it and the return was incredible. We really appreciate your help on the return.<br /><br />Gideon Linares
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I enjoy the game. The only complaint is that sometimes the target balls are all cleared, but a shooter ball still shows up, and shooting that ball causes the level to fail, even though I have a bunch of shooter balls left.  (Asus Transformer, Android 4.1.1) Other than that it is fun--even a little addictive.
B000002518|5.0|If you saw the Billy the Kid Movie with Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan!! Then you are familiar with this sound track...It is wonderful guitar and I listen to it all the time...Every song on this album is good...Knock knock Knocken on Heaven's Door!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|JGL did a great job as always, esp. as a young Bruce Willis. But there were plot devices that seemed pointless, and that the story could have been much better without them. There were some great things about the movie - esp. the which one is the hero/villain angle. There were also way too many plot holes to keep this from being a good story, or good movie.<br /><br />I expected much more.
B00007BKVC|5.0|How can you NOT have this movie...I even got the sound track to go with it...makes you want to go on a road trip...Without the ending!!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Got it right before Christmas, Thanks a bunch it is what my boyfriend wanted for Christmas and you made it happen, Thanks again.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Now if you don't know who the Captian and Gus are...Then where have you been? This is one of the best of Western Movies and a must have for every Western Collector...
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Lured by such a widespread reader acclaim I selected this story<br />It is about two American teenagers from Indiana, who are terminally ill with cancer, and fall in love after they meet in a Church Support Group. The author intended to make a moving tearful story, and throw a  philosophical debate with universal questions about love, life and death<br />With the exception of a few pieces of wisdom, the rest of the book, was inconsequential. I was not moved, I did not find the main characters quite well developed; and saw the secondary somewhat ludicrous.<br />After I finished the book, my mind was a total blank.<br />Sometimes a good review reader rating does not guarantee that a book will suit your preferences and for me this is a crystal clear example
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I play this on my iPhone and my 6 year old son plays it on our Kindle.  If you love dragons, you need to try this game!
0739378341|4.0|John:  Enjoyed the jail section. Enjoyed the setting.  Thanks for keeping it real.  Don't be afraid to edit the nonsense.  Try not to fall into the trap of tying everything all together too neatly.  Keep up the excellent work!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is durable and a very nice color.  It is a simple, streamlined design that does not add alot of bulk to your device.  I like the elastic band that keeps it closed while in my bag.  It helps to keep things from getting in between the Kindle and the case cover and potentially damaging the screen.  The Kindle is held in place securely at the corners.  Easy to clean with a damp cloth.  It has the sleep/wake function that automatically turns your Kindle off and on when you open and close it.  It only has the capability to prop your Kindle in landscape mode.  Overall a good value, just keep in mind that there is no portrait mode.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Product arrived in specified time frame and in great shape.  I would not hesitate to purchase from this site again.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this set and found myself having a hard time putting it down. I can not wait to read it again. Found myself rooting for Peeta and absolutely loved Cinna, Finnick, and Boggs. Not sure if I want to ruin my memories of this book by watching the movies . . .
1451673442|5.0|Worth reading and a great guide to living your life.  I will start the 28 day program tomorrow and look for some positive changes in my life.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I read it in record time and can't stop thinking about the characters.<br />It is very emotional but I loved it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great app, so easy and fun to use! I love being able to check the weather. my horoscope plus build my vocabulary all on one page.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|A fantastic read!! I highly recommended it.<br />It is suitable for all ages and very easy to follow.<br />Captivating.Brilliant<br />I loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this app. I really enjoy breeding, and, hatching new dragons. I give this app five stars awesome app.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|The movie was good overall, but not very accurate, although I did not buy it as research material! Storyline is adequate and is a good excuse to spend an evening on the couch.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game overall.  Sorry line was slightly lame.  Graphics were good.  Map helped with keeping track of where to go.  Occasionly I would have to tap an item several times to pick it up.  That would be my biggest negative.  Overall I enjoyed the game.
1451673442|5.0|I love reading books from Rhonda Byrne, this book is the TOP of all her master peaces. I must say that all the steps of how to improve my life and make remarkable changes, really helped me to achieve my goals! I am grateful that my friend recommend me the Magic. Thank You Rhonda for sharing your knowledge with us :-)
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love the love the look, feel and function of this case on my kindle fire!  It looks and feels like an old leather book which is such a nice complement to the kindle. It also holds the device securely with the elastic bands and I can hold it like a traditional book or fold the cover back entirely. It is exactly what I was looking for.
B0076DELIG|5.0|An intriguing continuation of the irascible detective. Unrelenting looks into the dark side of the soul.<br />At the end we are rewarded with another solved mystery.
B007MDB548|5.0|All my Grands love it. Really works great in the blu ray and sounds awesome with the surround sound, Out standing!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Catchy story and good writing but not terribly &#34;deep&#34;--and I didn't really like the ending, but I guess that's part of the catch
B0054JZC6E|2.0|When I started playing these games, I was extremely confused. I thought I was getting 132 games, not three. I would prefer having every game instead of having to.advance to each game.
B00AUA67GQ|5.0|Easy to use. You can only write or type on the screen I don't think you can change colors, but it's easy to read and copies your handwriting perfectly. And I'm glad it's free because I really didn't want to pay $9.99 for the pro one. Anyways it works just fine and I love it when I'm taking notes
B009186JYI|4.0|Great fun and the remaster is superb but it would be even better with more concert footage. The live stuff that is included is worth it alone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this is one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my whole life  is wonderful the miss of emotions
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Slammed and Point of Retreat are two of my favorite books and Colleen Hoover is fabulous.  Hopeless is a new favorite and this story should be a movie!  Be prepared to go through a variety of emotions while reading this book.  Be prepared for the ride and do not think you have it figured out because more than likely, you do not.  Also, you will not be able to put it down so hunker down somewhere and get reading.<br /><br />WOW!!  These characters and this story is just amazing.  I laughed, smiled, cringed, cried, yelled and had to take some deep breaths at times.  I got sucked in...I was invested in these characters.  It takes a great deal for that to occur.  I just finished reading the book minutes ago and wiped the last of my tears. I know I am not formulating my thoughts as I would like but I am still RAW after reading this book.  Just read it.  You will not be disappointed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's a great book I loved it.. it was hard to put the books down. My son will be reading it next.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|I'm 18 years old and up until reading this book I have hated nothing in the world more than reading. I bought a kindle because I wanted to start reading more and figured this would be a good book to start with seeing that I'm a baseball fanatic and liked the movie. After finishing it I now know that I couldn't have made a better choice. I enjoyed every page from start to finish and strongly recommend this book to anyone, not just baseball fans.
079073382X|5.0|This is an enchanting tale. Ethan Hawke is one of my favorites. Don't forget to purchase the Sequel; just as charming!!!!
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|watched w/ 3 kids ages 8 - 12 and all did not enjoy it...found it very boring and did not keep their interest
B000035P7S|5.0|This is a great movie, a great Love Story, Great Acting; I can just watch this movie over and over!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I'm a big fan of the Bourne trilogy (Identity, Supremacy, and Ultimatum) that starred Matt Damon as the elusive, rogue CIA operative known by his codename Jason Bourne. As such, I decided to watch this film given the success of the first three. This movie is essentially a sub-plot of the Bourne Ultimatum, as most of the events in this film overlap with those of the previous installation. Even if you didn't watch Ultimatum or any of the earlier movies, the plot I think should still be relatively easy to follow, save for some of the details concerning CIA programs and initiatives. Nevertheless, I thought that in the end it still left a lot to be desired, as it failed to tie some of the loose ends of the plot but who knows, there might be an additional Bourne installation. Action scenes are nice, demonstrating many of the main character's skills as a CIA operative in combat, navigation, and logistics.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Who doesn't Love this Movie and OMG on DVD in Blue-ray. I look forward to watching this movie almost on a monthly basis. It's right up there with GWTW!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft will be updated soon they said what they were adding in the next update to apologize for how long it's taking
B000683VI4|5.0|This is an All Time great movie; well acted, well written, well directed. The story is charming and should hit home for every generation. After watching this movie several times with plans to watch many times more I still can't decide who played their part the best; Ryan as Noah is completely dynamic, Rachel as Allie owned her part, James Garner and Gena Rowlands were just as compelling as the aging couple. This is one of the Best Love Stories on film!!!
B004LWZW8S|4.0|I'd seen it before on DVD so I ordered a used copy of it in Bluray on Amazon. The disc was in perfect shape and the box showed minimal wear. There was definately quality for the buck with this purchase. The vendor said it was in &#34;very good shape&#34; and they weren't  lying!<br /><br />Bluray really brings out the best quality of picture playback with computer generated movies IMO. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for movies like LOTR's (extended version) and complete (but good) computer generated movies like &#34;Wall-e&#34;, &#34;Kaena&#34; and &#34;Up&#34;.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|This is one of those action movies that are not only awesome but intelligently done, funny at appropriate intervals, but keeps the adrenaline going through the whole thing. This movie is actually so good that I watch it when I'm *really* not feeling the cardio for the day. It's nice having the BR for the extra visuals. :)
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Puchased for my granddaughter, I watched it and loved it!  A little roughhousing and somewhat scary moments for smaller kids (under 4) but otherwise a good heartwarming story line and plenty of humor.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|The disc would not play  on our DVD player. It would partially play on our computer but still had issues about half way through. It had to be returned.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app every day.  It has lots of choices to make the best alarm for you.  At no cost, I highly recommend it.
B004SBULWE|3.0|I was expecting this program to shut down all of the running screens and programs, however it does not recognize when text messaging, clock, managing tasks, etc windows are open.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My book club read this book and we liked it!! Some of the members did not like the switching back and forth of the characters' story telling chapters, but I liked the style. I thought the style was necessary to understand the conclusion of the book!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very good read, I finished it over-night.  One of those books you can't put down.  It's full of twists, thoughtful characters, action, and very well written.  You will not be disappointed.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I was somewhat satisfied with Yahoo Mail until they started changing it every couple of years. In December they changed it again. The new look is horrible! It has no personality at all. It's boring and all the theme colors are muted.They give you several different themes you can use but they are all awful. And now when my email come in I can't see the pictures unless I open the pages with my browser. This takes alot more time to sort thru my emails. You can send a message to Yahoo but I'm sure they don't read or care that they have the worst email outthere and no customer service.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|As the title says, I think the first one is by far the best.  This one carries the tradition of having Scrat steal the show but that's ok.  I thought it was worth watching but I don't plan to watch it again.
1600247245|5.0|Waiting nine months for the new Harry Bosch novel as this new story is one of the better Connelly efforts.  Great story line from a very talented Michael Connelly.
B000065U1N|5.0|I remember when this event occurred.  This film gives an interesting version with fine writing and acting as well as realistic backgrounds.  It would be a shame to miss it.
B00447L4JG|5.0|my oldest daughter has been looking for some time for this movie, so it was a great surprise for her when I got it for her for christmas.  it arrived ontime and wrapped up all new.
B004T0XYKK|5.0|The colors are fantastic.  I've noticed that blu-ray really stands out best on older films.  The quality difference is impressive to say the least.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This show is continuing to be good with each and every season.  The cast is one that has so much chemistry with one another that it really is truly a great show.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I really like this app....so much better than regular jigsaw puzzles. I had a game sort of like this on my computer a few years ago and haven't seen anything like it since and this is even better! I like that you can choose to just relax and complete puzzels or you can play in fever mode which adds a bit of a challenge. I recommend this app to anyone, I don't think it would be too great of a challenge for older children and the hint button is available if needed. I really hope there will be more apps like this available in the very near future because I can't put it down and I don't want it to be over....lol;)
B0053O89KG|5.0|Again Castle delivers with a great season.  The DVDs came to me in great condition and I haven't had any problems with them playing.  Will be getting season 5 when it comes out.
B001Q8FRMQ|5.0|5 star, classic, master-piece album! Highly recommended to any person that appreciates Serge Gainsbourg. You will not want to skip any songs on this. Every part is gold!
B0015KO52S|5.0|From the first song to the last, this is one of the best cds I've purchased.  It's like a book with each track it's own chapter.  I have so many different favorite songs.  I am a huge Jack White fan and this is a perfect addition to the collection.
B005HSL626|1.0|Its not working on my tablet it keeps saying that it is not responding and it keeps closing  other then that love the game when I could play
0525953728|5.0|This is a great story and a great behind the scenes look at one of the most historical moments in our Nation's history.  The book keeps you hanging on and glued to every last word!
B005RJI67I|3.0|The headline says it all. I thought I only bought the Harry Potter mini-figure because the complete sets were a bit too expensive for my budget. I remember looking at this set but not actually purchasing it. Perhaps due to the holi-daze of the holidays, I seriously don't remember getting it and/or wrapping it. Hmmmm...
0790744295|5.0|I watched the movie on Netflix's instant play and liked it so much I came here and bought it. I'm a huge Stephen King fan, so it's no surprise that I liked it. In my opinion the first Creepshow is better than the second, and the filth titled &#34;Creepshow 3&#34; is not even a Creepshow film in any Creepshow fan's eyes (Tales from the Darkside the Movie is the real Creepshow 3). So if you want to get a taste of the series, start with this film.
1932735410|5.0|And I find it effective to learn from this book, explains in a way that you will understand the PMP lessons, thank you Rita : )
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This was a gift for our teenage son, who has been bitten by the photography bug. It has not been off his camera since!
B007WOFXB8|3.0|Yeah, I'm a sucker for 2-in-ones and more. And some of these \\"original album series\\" boxes are cool. But this one is not worth buying if you are looking to save space and replace the 5 individual cds you probably already have in your collection.  To start off, it features 3 albums that are the remastered versions, but don't have the bonus tracks you get when you buy them separately.  That leaves Deguello, which is the same as the stand alone cd, and then Rio Grande Mud, with the infamous 80's electro-drums.  The idea is nice, especially if you remember the original album packaging (hence the name of the series, I guess), but unnecessary and inadequate in this case.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Violet even more (memorable quotes) and like the pacing of relationship between Matthew and Mary.  Very realistic.<br />Beautiful sets and costumes.  Brings the era alive
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everybody. Its definitely a cunning movie that i could watch over and over again. My new favorite movie.
B0087WRGVY|5.0|As a hard rock/metal enthusiast I'm always looking for something new. I had placed this album on my Amazon wishlist after having read a few glowing reviews. I had never heard the group before and was in for quite a surprise when I hit the \\"play\\" button on my cd player.<br /><br />Honestly, it took a couple of listens for the vocals to grow on me. Mind you, the singer is top notch as far as range and technique but his voice is certainly not typical for a metal band. If you only listen to the music, you'd swear you were listening to some lost Whitesnake album from the peak of their popularity in the late 80's. The lead guitars are very Sykes-ish / Schenkerish; all the instrumentation is top notch in fact. I particularly like the drum mix.<br /><br />Back to the vocals...The singer has a voice as smooth as silk but after the first listen or two, I kept thinking, \\"Is this Swedish guy a fan of the modern Nashville-scene?\\" I could just as easily imagine some of his vocals in a song from any number of Nashville-produced groups. Now, I'm not much of a country music fan but I certainly appreciate talent. Strangely, this guy's voice grew on me and by the third or fourth listen, I was hooked. In fact, I'd say that the juxtaposition between the silky smooth vocals and the blazing guitar sound makes for one of the more unique bands I've heard over the past 30 years or so! I grew up in the heart of the metal movement of the 80's (a.k.a., the \\"good ole' days) and back then, you seemed to have a few vocal templates: the high-ranged wailers such as Tony Harnell of TNT, and the heavy, throaty vocals of the Brian Johnsons and Udo Dirkschneiders.<br />The Eclipse vocalist defies any metal stereotype that I can think of and in that sense, is a welcome breath of proverbial fresh air.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this album to any fan of melodic metal...heck, I'd recommend it to anyone who appreciates superior production, songwriting and musicianship regardless of their musical taste.te.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Much like the first book, Larsson built an astonishing world of deceipt and treachery integrated sinuously into the civilized facade of society, whether it be in Sweden or any other country in the world.  This story could have happened anywhere, but Larsson decided to keep it at home and build it on real city streets, towns and cafes.  This second book of the series  continues, amplifies and invigorates the trilogy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The ending didn't clear the loose ends for me. Not what I expected and wanted as an ending. I was disappointed.
0060899220|5.0|If you are a Bourdain fan you will surely enjoy this book.  His off color humor and direct approach are like no other food show on the networks.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|MIB 3 is as funny as it is fun. The natural chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is spectacular. Jones (K) is so laconic, that he is the perfect foil for Smith (J), talkative, observant, hilarious. I don't know how Tommy Lee Jones kept a deadpan face during scenes; there must have been a lot of out-takes. Also, full marks to &#34;the young agent K&#34;, an astounding performance. MIB 3 focuses on the relationship between the two agents, with a hair-raising back story, and the payoff is sublime.<br />Unless somebody spoils the ending, you won't see the finale twist coming.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|The story line was surburb.  His past \\"was\\" behind him and he turned his life around, but now his past has caught up with him. Is he an imposter? Did he commit murder or not? The dilemma is to either acknowledge or deny his past and what those consequences will bring.<br />Would his wife be looked upon as an adulteress. Would she and the towns people who came to believe and trust him lose all their investments and he would not be hanged, or should he confess to murder and be hanged, which then his wife would keep her respect and the towns people investment and hard work would be saved.<br /><br />Come to think of it the story line in a lot of way's is like Les Misreables.<br /><br />The inner turmoil of what decision to choose.  I especially like Jodie Fosters plea, her acting.  A real tear jerker.
B007GEMQ2I|4.0|This was a great set my girlfriend and I had a lot of fun putting together.<br />It's a good size and there are a lot of details on the inside of it<br />The only downside is it's way overpriced. I got it on a sale and I recommend you do the same.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Very good show at the Colisee Pepsi in Quebec city. Proud to have attended this show live and to have been in the crowd !
B0087X728K|4.0|I got this when I purchased my new computer and cooler, I got the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO, which I new came with thermal paste but I was recommended to buy this because it is higher quality. Seems to be running okay 3 months later.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I'll admit I haven't followed the plan exactly - I've made huge gains in strength with just some of the tips, and I have no doubt if I was more diligent I'd be way further along.<br />The six moves form a pretty darn complete package. You'll be a fitter, happier, more productive human being if you do them all, at whatever level. I have a number of friends in worse shape always complaining about not having a gym close by, or how expensive they are, whatever. This book is worth a year's membership and you can do everything at your desk.<br />I'm sold. Highly recommended.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Some people will call There Will Be Blood &#34;boring&#34; and I agreed the first time I watched it, but the 2nd time I really got hooked. The story of this man and his adopted son on their journey from penny pinching to oil tycoons is phenomenal. Paul Dano's character in this movie is annoying and relatable at the same time.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I gave it one star because the website doesn't allow it to go any lower, and, for all the effort put in by the computer animation team. Other than that, this movie should be negative 1 star.<br /><br />The plot and sequences does not make any sense what so ever. To list a few; teleporting another planet into earth's atmosphere? Really? Optimus prime getting trapped in a bunch of cables for 20mins of the movie? High tech alien robotic race ends up fighting with shields, swords, and axes?<br /><br />There's literally some plot hole or something that does not make sense every 5minutes of the movie, throughout the ENTIRE thing. If you thought the second movie was ridiculous, wait until you see this.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie is if you want to leave your brain dead for 2hours and watching flashy robots transform and fire rockets at random things. Besides that, please do yourself a favor and do something more productive with the extra 2 hours of your life.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This is a great movie. Sam Rockwell shines in it; acting alongside himself. Kevin Spacey voices the robot GERTY with a monotone voice and emoticon faces which actually creates an interesting character. If you like Sci-Fi and suspense this movie is for you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a great game with good storyline and graphics. It is suffiently complex but you don't need a walkthru to get to the end. Hours of fun....
B001EN71CW|5.0|It is a shame that this show got canceled after one season, I'm sure Fox regrets it everyday. The hype alone around this tv of 9 people flying around the &#34;verse&#34; should be enough to get you to watch it. It's on Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant for those who want to check it out, but I know once you do you'll want to buy it on Blu-ray to have in your collection. While you're at it check out the Firefly movie Serenity.
B004UPANAI|2.0|The Wolverine story is excellent, but you can juxtapose this movie against X2 for a great example of poor vs. good execution of the same story (or at least there is lots of overlap).
B000P0J09M|1.0|After realizing this is my girlfriend's favorite move, I made this purchase because of it's great value figuring it would make a great gift for the holidays. Placed the order mid-December, tracked it to my city by December 19th, then by December 24th realized it was mis-shipped up to Federal Way, WA and never moved until January 8th when I realized the item was shipped back to the seller. Seller refunded money. I had to salvage a late expecting gift by buying local when realizing the seller told me he would refund my money.<br /><br />In a word, disappointed by the inconvenience caused by ordering the item thru Amazon.<br /><br />-E
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I kept waiting for the usual Scarpetta thrill to happen. This book was just a lot of whining, and different twists & turns that never really developed throughout the book. Very disappointed in a series I usually love.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Plays fine.  Typical spider game.  Only two things annoyed me and both were minor. I play sideways and when moving cards I keep hitting the slide down adjusting feature for my kindle. The other thing was in play if you just tap the cards they will go to any stack except the one you want to finish a column. I waste a lot of moves that way.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked the story of Ana and Christian. I just couldn't put the book down. I'm officially addicted to them!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I bought this for a Xmas gift for my sister who loves the Harry Potter series and she was absolutely thrilled with it.  The craftmanship and the packaging set it all up as such a wonderful unique gift. I'm the favorite sister now!
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I was so excited for this album that I pre-ordered it, I love how they made it a concept album and I love all of these new songs, as I expected to anyway. Black Veil Brides is by far my favourite band and I'm so glad that I bought this, it's honestly a really good price considering there are 19 tracks (including the little blurbs/transmissions). Totally worth the money.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|As far as Christmas traditions go, this is one of my favorites.  Its primary theme of redemption of the soul gives hope to us all, and all who feel the weight of greed and commercialism during the holidays should read this to lift their spirits.  Let us all toast Ebenezer  Scrooge with a Merry Christmas!  And God bless us everyone!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Except for the annoying pop-up ads as soon as the deal is made, this is a delightful product. Fortunately, the ads go away after a few games have been played.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Just what it should be! Oh it is also useful too. I have forgotten to mention it is very pretty aswell.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I enjoyed the story and different perspectives it had great characters and was a well told historic account. However I found it to be a bit like a long soap opera at times.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|It's always nice to see Tom Cruise in a movie. He does some daring acts that put me on the edge of my seat.  We will surely watch this again.
B005HSL626|4.0|I think that it's a game if you want<br />to kick someones butt the 1st time<br />in your life and then have them work<br />there butt off until they kick yours<br />again- LOL
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is awesome! I am so glad I got the ad-free version. It's the first time I've ever paid for an app, and it was well worth the 2 bucks. I love that it links to your music automatically and you can pick a song to wake you up instead of the provided alarm sounds. The sleep timer is also great. You make your own playlist and set it for however long you want it to play. This app is VERY EASY to use!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well, it's easy at first then it gets a little<br />harder. Never buy one on your small cell<br />phone, get a kindle fire hd
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great, no frills, calculator to use.  It's easy to see; visually appealing.  Large button and numerical format.  Has some more than basic functions.  Great application.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|Katy Perry never fails to impress! Love the acoustical-like song and many others that are not heard on the radio.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app!  Lots of great ideas!  It's the first place I go in the morning even before the news.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I chose 4 stars because it was intriguing but really would like to know if Ana will eventually forgive Christian for not loving her the she loved him.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|My friend was absolutely thrilled with this gift!  She was so surprised and thought I hadn't been listening to her and the things she wanted for Christmas.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Strange heroine, strange hero.  At first thought this was just another sexy story.  The young hero is a little hard to believe that he could be so intuitive and understanding and absolutely bad boy sexy with the romantic savvy to build a relationship.  Patience is not usually a teenage boy trait but this made him totally hypnotizing.  To have him also be so caring and loving was genius.  The girl is all messed up and with deep-seated reasons that we don't see in the beginning.  I did not want to put this book down.  I wanted from the first to find out what made these characters the way they were.  I do recommend this book.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This is a book that grabs you from the very first photograph depicted.  The pictures are haunting but the story is beautiful and I had trouble putting the book down!  This is a must read and I'm excited that there will be a sequel coming out later this year!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|While I spent the entire book wondering just what could this poor girl and her &#34;adoptive family&#34; go through next, and some of the storyline was questionable, I loved this book.  It is about perseverance and triumph and I loved the characters.  Am waiting for the sequel because I know there is more to this story.
B003FCKIKM|5.0|Really good album from my favorite band.  A little dated with the organ on How Much Love but Jimi Jamison's vocals make up for<br />it.  Really love the hard-rockin Never Let You Go.  Great addition to any Survivor fan's collection.  As always love ya Jimi.
0060589469|2.0|I kind of liked the book and the fresh way it starts.<br />But then the author suddenly goes into complicated explanations about science and beliefs, which could have been interesting, except for the fact that he does not know what science is.<br />He believes science is a search for truth. I guess that this leads to the kind of beliefs that oppose science and religion. And i have no interest in that.<br /><br />That ended the pleasure I had reading the book.
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder is currently re-writing the history books when it comes to great Batman.<br />His stories will no doubt go down in history with that of Miller or Loeb's great works.<br /><br />The Court of Owls is the thrilling start of the DC's New 52 Batman and it couldn't do a better job of pulling the reader in.<br />I found this story at my local library and almost instantly after shutting this book, I was online looking for the next release which I found out wouldn't be out for many months to come.<br /><br />Unable to wait this long I ventured into my local comic shop to purchase the rest of the Night of Owls arc (which will be in Vol. 2) and have been reading ever since.<br /><br />Readers should also note: this story has inspired Snyder to write a spin-off about a rogue Talon. Entitled \\"Talon\\" which is available in the DC New 52.<br /><br />I highly suggest fans of Batman, or just comics in general, check him out.
1449410243|4.0|Given as a gift at Christmas.  It was passed around so everyone could enjoy it.  We all own cats, and you could see at least one or more reasons  why your cat acted the way it did.  Best advice, don't turn your back on your kitty!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. If you are thinking this story is just for kids, think again. This has friendship,war, survival, and mythology. There are few books that have so many layers to it.
B007URCTOG|5.0|Loved this story! Amazing that something like that can happen. Glad that it was not predictable. Really great date night movie!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book I loved it it is a very cool book hope you reAd it some day enjoy the awesome
B00005JLR2|5.0|AS WE ARE GRANDPARENTS WE LOVE TO KEEP OUR DISNEY MOVIE COLLECTIONS<br />UP SO ANY CHILDREN VISITING CAN FIND A MOVIE THEY LOVE! GREAT MOVIE FOR<br />ALL AGES!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great fast reading book, if you liked the Fifty Shades of Grey series you will love this.
B00004R99F|5.0|THE PERFECT GIFT FOR ANY CHILD! OUR GRANDDAUGHTER SAYS THERE IS SO<br />MANY NEAT THINGS SHE HAS LEARNED FROM THIS MOVIE! SHE IS 3!!
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Loved the DVD.  I like everything that Annie Lennox does and this DVD just confirms my admiration of her and her voice.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|A bit sick of the subject.  The first one didnt make much sense to me and so I havent read the others.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln in 1861- \\"I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution . . . has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable.\\"<br />Lincoln in 1862,  \\"If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that..\\" I guess he changed his mind....<br /><br />Lincoln- before seeing the movie I thought this was about the Emancipation Proclamation and the entire Lincoln admin. It is not. It is mostly about JAN 1865 and the 13th amendment freeing the slaves. The Emancipation Proclamation, from 2 years earlier only \\"freed\\" slaves in the south, where Lincoln had no jurisdiction, and no means of enforcement, but not in Maryland Delaware, DC, Pennsylvania, etc and many other places where Lincoln did! It kept the British and French from intervening on the part of the South, which they were planning to do. The other practical effect was to end enforcement of the Dred Scott case, and the Fugutive Slave Act, one of the worst pieces of legislation ever but that's another story. Even as Lincoln is crafting the amendment, he has slaves everywhere serving him...<br /><br />Slavery is, of course, wrong and evil. We see that now, but its wasn't so obvious to people in the Civil war.  People on both sides.  Slavery just was, like the sun coming up. These days most Civil War revisionist movies show a army of right thinking liberals and abolitionists going south to show southerners the error of their ways. Not accurate at all. This movie shows in vivid detail the varying opinions in the North from people who just wanted the long war over and had never thought out the implications of winning the war and as a result freeing the slaves. When asked by Lincoln what they thought about freedom for slaves, one couple says \\"ni....s would just steal our chickens and then fight our men for their jobs\\". Some couldn't care less about blacks, some want no freedom at all just an end to the four year war, some don't want blacks competing with whites for jobs, somewhat some limited freedom short of citizenship and some like the Thaddeus Stevens (wonderfully played by Tommy Lee Jones in a wig) want the full rights that blacks enjoy now and there is every opinion in between.<br /><br />It is worth noting that about a third of the Union Army deserted after the Emancipation Proclamation. According to their dairies, most in the Army said they fought to preserve the Union and very few were actually abolitionists.<br /><br />The movie shows Daniel Day Lewis is eerily masterful as Lincoln. Lincoln wants full freedom in the constitution and he wants it now while the war is ending . And like a modern day LBJ, he knows who to cajole, who to threaten and who to plead with. He tells his homespun witticisms and stories endear or annoy congressmen until one threatens to throw something at him to get him to stop. There is true debate here in Congress, Stevens calls another senator a lizard with green slime in his veins and clear proof that \\"all men are not created equal\\" because he is so dumb, or words to that effect. Lewis has Lincoln's walk and his stoop shouldered stance and his world-weary craggy face. Sally Fields plays Mary Todd Lincoln and is nominated for supporting actress. Sharp tongued, depressive, flighty. The real Mary Lincoln wasn't that outspoken with Lincoln's political opponents. That would have been unladylike.<br /><br />Not explicitly stated here is why Lincoln was in a hurry. He had no intention of punishing the South after the war. He believed in \\"malice toward none, with charity for all\\". It was the Republicans who would disenfranchised all men who fought for the South for a decade after the war, to punish the South forLincoln's death and the war.  Had men in the South been able to vote on the 13th amendment it might not have passed...<br /><br />A lot of dark \\"available light\\" oil lamp shots (the light bulb not having been invented yet) . This movie was mostly shot in Richmond VA (!) where a lot of federalist style buildings remain. There is a scene supposedly the shelling of Richmond and the burning of the Tredegar Iron Works that look like Spielberg actually lit up the real building, still on the banks of the James River waterfront.<br /><br />Very good, very authentic all things considered, very complex. Hopefully this movie will open people's eyes to the complexities of the Civil war, even if I wish it had started earlier with Emancipation. Best Actor- Day-Lewis. Odds-on favorite to win it all, the kind of movie the Academy likes.<br /><br />By the way, soldiers who actually fought in the Civil War or people lived thru those times thought \\"Birth of a Nation\\" and later \\"Gone with the Wind\\" were the most accurate movies ever done about the period! Now liberals shun these movies. Now we have mostly revisionism. This movie isn't revisionist, for the most part it's accurateLincoln's death and the war.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Could not put it down.  Have always loved Jodi Picoult!  This one definitely did not disappoint!  What a live story!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo - It is really unusual for a movie to play this long. I wore short and a t-shirt when I first saw this movie. When I took my son it was still in theaters in January! Crazed Iranians, mad at America for having supported the Shah, lead by the Ayatollah, invade the America Embassy and take 200+ American hostages during the Carter Admin. They accuse them of being spies. A small group escape and hide out in the Canadian ambassadors house. The CIA want to get them out of Iran . A CIA maverick played by Ben Afflick hits upon a plan to smuggle them out which is \\"so crazy it just might work\\". He goes to Iran posing as a movie producer for a scifi movie. He brings passports for the hidden Americans. He convinces the Iranians they are scouting out locations to film \\"Argo\\" the scifi movie and the hidden American are his film crew!<br /><br />Ben Afflick produced this movie, directed it and is the lead actor. Alan Arkin plays a Hollywood producer who backstops the effort from California. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor. \\"If I am going to make a fake movie, it's going to be a great fake movie\\". This movie is a masterpiece of directorial tension, like a pot of water which starts hot and gets hotter consistently throughout. I think this is the best directed movie I saw this year and it isn't even nominated for best director academy award! or Best actor! Based on real events. Make sure to visit the rest room before seeing this movie. It is non-stop suspense. A patriotic movie, in the best sense of the word. Audience stands and cheers at the end. Highest recommendations. My early favorite for best movie
B009O2XY12|5.0|Fun game. As you reach higher levels in the game, your problem solving skills becomes more challenging. I am addicted!
B00AFEXRME|2.0|*** contains spoilers*** but most of the interesting stuff mentioned happens really early<br /><br />(Flight- briefly, a frontloaded two hour plus movie - all the action and viewer interest in the beginning. Denzel Washington plays a coked-up & drunken pilot who pilots a full plane of a cheap poorly maintained airlines. The elevators or ailerons on the plane break and jam midair. The plane goes into a sheer dive. Washington's' character performs an impossible maneuver, he glides the broken plane near the ground, flips it over upside down in the air to slow it, flips it over again and miraculously lands the plane  in a field  saving most of the passengers. This excitement happens in the first half hour.<br /><br />The remaining hour and a half is about the FAA investigators looking into the landing and Washington's character coming to terms with his cocaine and booze addictions. AA & Narcotics Anonymous 12-step stuff. Realistic and very well acted, but sad, depressing, gritty and not really what I call entertainment.  Probably a good object lesson for addicts.<br /><br />However: possible Best actor -Denzel Washington, were it not for Daniel Day Lewis in &#34;Lincoln&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Just finished the first book and starting the second.  What a fun read!<br />Ready for the story to continue :)
B00ANT6OK8|3.0|Zero Dark Thirty- Katherine Bigelow, who directed the gritty Hurt Locker about the war in Iraq, directed this movie too. There are similarities. Both are about war and are contemporary, both are very realistic or too realistic...spoiler alert. The story tracks CIA interrogator/agent \\"Maya's efforts to track down Osama bin Laden termed \\"UBL\\" for a decade.  Jessica Chastain (\\" Tree of Life\\") - plays another very difficult role with incredible authenticity.<br /><br />Note: the first half hour of this movie show very graphic scenes of beatings, torture and water boarding of Al Qaida terrorists. Not for the faint of heart.  The next slow hour or so is authentic spycraft as Maya carefully tracks down lead after lead looking UBL, interrogating tortured Al Qaida terrorists. Leads and false leads. Maya watches her military and CIA friends get killed in terrorist attacks. She develops a solid lead for Abu Achmed (sp?) who is an Al Qaida courier. He leads her attention to a Pakistani compound. She gets sent to HDQ, Langley,  from Iraq after she is nearly killed by Afghan terrorists herself. Then she has to try to convince CIA managers to go after this suspicious compound in Pakistan (excuse me for giving away the whole plot, but you read it in the papers last summer). The last hour is more heroic and action, Maya finally convinces the CIA , & Seal Team 6 goes into Pakistan and kills UBL. Lots of blood, lots of graphic violence, authentic as a movie can be, nearly a documentary.<br /><br /> Also a more of less feminist subplot about women not being listened to by the CIA and military brass.<br /><br /> Some may say this is too graphic to be considered entertainment, others may say they like it because it is the real thing. . Personally, for a spy/war movie, I much preferred the gripping,  less bloody and occasionally funny Argo.

B007REV4T8|5.0|SkyFall - What makes Bond tick? Some call this the best Bond of all time. Is he just the mindless tool of the British goverment killing mad men who want to take over the world or does he have thoughts and feelings? During the last and most forgettable James Bond movie of the 20+ series, Quantum of Solace, some four years ago, there was a writers strike. The movie was half in production. So rather than stop the movie, non-union non-guild writers finished the plot about hoarding water and it was awful. The producers and people behind the series wanted to do a much better job this time they made a real plot with real character development. Imagine, instead of the usual two dimensional good guys and bad guys, James Bond as a real complex person with realistic motivation. and Judy Dench as \\"M\\" well motivated also. Will she sacrifice an MI-6 agent to stop a killer? Daniel Craig as Bond might make viewers forget Sean Connery.<br /><br />Androgenous bad guy Javier Bardem has a grudge and blows up MI-6 main building in London! ( Her Majesties Secret Service - the English equivalent of the CIA). The Bond series has always been shot in exotic locations. This was shot in China and Turkey but it also has for the first time London and the bleak austere moody Scottish Highlands, which for some odd reason were never in James Bond movies before! There is also a great scene of Bond jumping into the non-destroyed portion of a moving train!<br /><br /> Geniunely funny in places, even pokes fun at other James Bond movies. There is a new \\"Q\\" section with a new, very young Q who eschews most gadgets!<br /><br /> the best Bond of all time? That honor might go to \\"Goldfinger\\" or \\"From Russia with Love\\", but this is certainly the most detailed and complex of the series and one of the best and should not be missed. If you think the Bond series is mindless action movies you are in for a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />This movie is actually nominated for academy awards, in minor categories .  But could have been nominated in many others.t could have been nominated in many others.
B003UESJFG|5.0|We love this movie!! Favorite part is the music and battle scene at the end.  Love the moral that all bad guys can turn into good guys.

B0042QNP2S|3.0|My 4 yr old got this for his b'day, and he loves it.  It is big in size, the doors open, and the operation is pretty realistic. The reason for 3 star review is:<br /><br />- I had to put the reflective stickers to indicate mirrors on various tiny plastic parts.  This was not easy, due to the size, location, and the curves of the mirror surfaces.<br />- Lack of any instructions, especially about what to do with a little plastic piece that the picture on the box says should go somewhere in the lower front grill, but no idea on how to get it.<br />- It needs more bells and whistles, including sound/light effects, and a garbage man figurine, steerable front-wheels, etc. for this price.<br /><br />I'll probably look for Tonka's going forward.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I loved this book, very interesting and I couldnt put it down, now im waiting for the next one to come out one kindle.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved all the twists and turns the writer had to offer...but the ending came up short form me. As I was reading what turned out to be the final page I was left empty. I was so confused that I went back and read the last chapter over again...I thought I might of missed something....I did...an Ending!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|this game is harder than others, won't let you play but several games and then you have to buy more to finish.  But I probably won't play this game all the way through what I have anyway.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good book that went by quickly- I didn't like it quite as much as the 1st one though- that's why I gave it only 4 stars
B009YU62H2|5.0|Very easy decision to buy this album,Soundgarden has that unique sound and their songs are always enjoyed with a little bit of that&#34; back in the day &#34;emotion.
B00A3YTC6Q|4.0|This franchise keeps coming out with the new styles but something I wish they would have done was not change the angle of the shot so many times! I want to watch the routine in its entirety to see the choreography work as a whole. Great music though!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|This is such an awesome show!  So nice to be able to catch up on previous episodes  using the Blu Ray!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This series is one of my favorites. FX has done a great job in tapping into the alternative perception of people. Between Sons of Anarchy and American Horror Story I am a happy camper. Great actors, great writers, and great shows! Keep it up!

B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I know a lot of people don't think this movie was acted very well or had a developed plot but I loved the style of cinematography and it was a great mindless action film to watch with my friends.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google has always been the best and easiest search engine for me. Couldn't imagine my ipad without it! Thank you!
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I think the purpose of this book is to let people know that it's OK to be introverts, and sometimes this trait can be advantageous. I got the point after a few pages, and then felt ok about myself. Then by the time I got to the middle of the book,  I grew tired of the how the author seemed to lionize introverts, and put down extroverts.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|use all the time, after i did the calibration test it seemed to be fairly accurate. its also nice to hear the verbal battery percentage.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app is so cute and super fun. It is a fun way to give you brain a little challenge but is NOT so difficult that a child would have trouble. This game is fun for all ages and best of all, free. Keep up the good work guys!

1400086035|5.0|Jim Dale does a fantastic job, as usual, narrating this audio book.  A Christmas Carol is one of my favorite stories and I am enjoying listening to it told by a true Englishman.  If you are not familiar with Jim Dale, he was also &#34;voice&#34; for the Harry Potter audio books for which he has won awards.  I cannot say whether this audiobook is truly unabridged as I am still listening to it, but so far, so good.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a challenging game and very fast-paced so I like that about it. You really have to pay attention as there is no downtime so it's good on road trips when you're a passenger.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|No. This was horrible. I only liked fat amy. I prefer glee honestly.<br />most of the characters were so annoying I just didnt bother to finsih it.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This downloader didn't have the greatest reviews, but I haven't had any problems with it and I use it all the time to view videos and search for new musicians.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|This movie was one of the few that implemented computer graphics when computers were still not widely owned and were still evolving.  I really liked the story and the creativity that was put into the movie.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I am having so much fun with my new Kindle. I really enjoy buying books and reading them .  I take it with me everywhere I go.

0345803493|5.0|This book was the best in the series. It kept my attention the whole way through. It's a great read
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|Thanks for putting this item on line.  it is a lot of fun to watch and it came fast to me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|With most stories where the main characters have suffered a great deal in their past you would normally flow through the story with the usual highs and lows. Hopeless is so much more than this, it is beautifully written, you are easily attached the characters and as the story unravels you are given so much more than what you expect.<br />Sky and Holder are both equally tainted from their pasts and as you find out more about them it's inevitable that their story will come to a climax. There are so many puzzle pieces to this story and Colleen does a great job to fit the pieces together as the main characters find ways to heal each other through the pain. Beautiful story and highly recommend you read this :)
B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as I liked &#34;Gone Girl&#34;.  Once I started reading it I could not put it down.  Highly recommended.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun game I like to solve puzzle challenge s. Like the choices in games they give<br />Would recommend it to other`s
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was excellent.  I read it so fast I couldn't believe myself.  I highly recommend it.
B003XQM2YU|2.0|I did not like this movie I thought plot was dumb  I did not like how king Richard Died nor did I like prince John roll as being an spoiled child
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This was a very good movie.  I would watch it again.  It was not a disappointment.  The rental was good and we did not have any technical issues while watching it.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had not read a Steven King book in years.  This book had me riveted to it from page one until the end. I hated to have it end, but loved how he ended it.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Not on par with high end science fiction like Prometheus, but a fun, at times haunting, and very violent flick.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King is awesome as usual<br />You would feel as though you were really there . Hope this one becomes his next movie.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book was very hard to understand. It was written at an intellectual level far above the average person. Other than that it was okay.
B00428CPUY|2.0|First two Crossroad DVDs were great. Great artists playing great songs. Just knew it was too good to be true or last. This 2010 issue was awful. Eric...how many times can you play the same song and have people buy it? Skip this one entirely.  Wait.... Go buy a Joe Bonamassa DVD.  You will be immensely better served!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I happen to like enigmas, and obviously this unfinished tale of cosmic drama is worth a second look. Yes the story line is well beyond: \\"Take me to your leader...and let's get the marines here,\\" script that seems to be the main course of US cinema. But what a treat this is when you take it for what it is, a fable in space to explain our origins and the need of humans to figure out if we are not alone, and why. That blond goddess that play the character of Vickers is worth the movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are absolutely AMAZING!!!!  I love them.  Listen to them all the time - and this CD won't EVER get old!!!
0345529057|4.0|I would recommend this product to another person interested in reading this series. As this was a gift and not for me, I do not have any input about the actual content in the book.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the packaging was rather poor and the corner of the box set was dented given the ground shipping. The packaging did come with some air cushions but they were only on one side of the box and therefore only protected the one side. If they simply added more packing on the other side of the book (there appeared to be enough space for additional packing cushions), the product would not have been dented.<br /><br />Overall, good buy for the money and product came as described.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Although I was sucked in by the sheer, merry lunacy of this world, its characters and their wardrobe, there's really no excusing some of the faultlines that run through the heart of this confused little horror saga. It suffers from a severe case of subplot-itis, and tries in vain to cram four chapters' worth of back story into nearly every face. Even the less interesting minor players are obsessively over-inspected, which leads the more important characters to pull constant disappearing acts. Pseudo-protagonist Belle Heathcote is the most glaring example, vanishing without explanation for a full forty minutes during the second act, and then materializing right in the middle of a cramped romance. Johnny Depp's Barnabus is the one constant, happily sailing far over the top in yet another colorful, inexplicably successful leading turn. I caught myself laughing at the punchlines more often than I'd expected, but Dark Shadows often tests the boundaries of good taste, and in one case (an out-of-left-field comic love scene) ventures too close to the uncomfortably absurd. Kooky and silly, it's unforgivably (and thoroughly) lacking in the kind of panache Tim Burton was always known for.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Good Read.  Refreshing that a tip of spear warrior tells his story and upsets the politicians.  Looking forward to his next book.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The picture-perfect Batman movie; dark and gritty and tragic but ultimately optimistic and meaningful, with an armful of colorful characters tossed in for seasoning. Of course, it's impossible to discuss the film without first touching on Heath Ledger, whose magnificent turn as the Joker unconscionably steals the show from the very moment he appears on the screen. Magical moments, memories and faces routinely come and go on the silver screen, but a role this iconic only comes around once or twice a generation, and the power of his appearance has been amplified over the years. Ledger deserves every bit of the credit he reaped for the part, even if his untimely demise may have heightened the hype to superhuman levels. The things his character gets to do, say, and imply are downright remarkable, and really elevate this from a very good superhero movie into a brilliant social commentary that just so happens to revolve around a man with a cape, cowl and vast personal armory. As in Batman Begins, the supporting cast is heavily peppered with brilliant performances from Hollywood's heavy-hitters, with particularly excellent showings from Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckhart, and once again Christian Bale masterfully inhabits the dual roles of Bruce Wayne and Batman. It's a great action movie, detective story, political thriller, superhero flick and moral tragedy, never feels half as long as its 152 minute run time lets on, and sticks the landing in every single important scene. One for the ages.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Took my high expectations and blew right by them.  If you love Zeppelin and have every production album, like I do, your collection will not be complete without this blue ray.

B0081JPTCQ|4.0|good job Handy Note. Youre trying to think like the user and that is what is going to set this app ahead of the competition. The writing  function is excellent on the KF HD, the organization of the interface makes sense, and privacy option is a great adder.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This was one of several movies on my sons Christmas list.  He invited me to watch with him.  WONDERFUL anime work!  I would recommend the movie to any anime lover.
B005FISBTO|2.0|I'm going to echo the other reviews here and say that, while Dexter is some of the most riveting television ever produced, these DVD's are terrible.  I'm very happy to have seen the sixth season, but I don't know that I will ever rewatch it because of the unskippable showtime commercial that comes on every time you put any of the discs in.  I'll admit that I didn't notice the spoiler in the trailer because I was not paying it any attention.  Showtime really borked this one.
B0048EANOM|5.0|I have had this movie for several years but wanted it on Blu-ray.  It is the very best movie about Kennedy
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was the best book I have read on my Kindle! I can't wait for  the sequel! Wonderful!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely recommend this book to anyone!!!! It was great and I found myself laughing, crying & feeling every emotion that was portrayed along the way... now I've got to find another book that will keep my attention like this one. Think it gonna be hard to top this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love it, You can find and see the weather at a glance.  This is a really great freebie.<br />A must have.
0345803485|1.0|I did not like this book at all really I am a fast reader but once I got to chapter 10 this book was not for me.  This book is really for women who dont get any and live in a fantasy world I really dont understand what all the hype was about.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC News is THE way to find out what is going on in the rest of the world. It provides a different view from the old \\"tested and true\\" domestic news channels.<br />If you are curious, this is the app for you.

B002UTNKWE|5.0|&#34;Un Ballo In Maschera&#34;  I first purchased this recording in 1968. It is a joy to hear this recording on DVD and I found the sound to be superd.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Not typical demille!  main character too much of a comedian.  plot was drawn out and boring.  not nelson's  typical quality.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The story of Camp Half-Blood continues. A fast paced, exciting read for anyone who has read the Percy Jackson series.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The author has a wonderful imagination.  I was totally engrossed by this mesmerizing story.  Since I've read his previous novels, I now look forward to the next one.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app has a lot to offer and it is really useful. With a radar and the latest  forecast!  This is the best out of all the other free weather apps.
B002ZG980U|5.0|There is nothing to say, but see this movie - buy it or rent it.  It is on my top ten movies of all time.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I am a big fan of his books but this one is my new favorite. I cannot wait until it comes out in theaters and hope the film stays true to the novel. So sad I am done reading it I could have followed this love story a little longer :)
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|The film opens up like \\"Basic\\" with one man requesting another. A man (Joseph Sikora) is accused of random shootings. The evidence is overwhelmingly against him. In Iraq he was a sniper. Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) arrives as a brash and cocky individual, a role Tom Cruise has perfected. Jack is elusive. Eventually he takes on the task as the lead investigator for the accused. His lawyer (Rosamund Pike) happens to be the daughter of the prosecutor (Richard Jenkins). As Jack investigates, things are not what they seem which draws us into the story.<br /><br />Unfortunately the mystery is short lived as clues come too fast. It then resorts to an us vs. them with a car chase scene that lasted way to long for this type of crime drama. The script was otherwise well done. Acting was as we would expect from the cast. Makes for a decent rental. There could be a Jack Reacher sequel, hopefully with some complexity. This is another film shot in Pittsburgh, the Hollywood of the East.<br /><br />Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Some spicy language and sexual references.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Movie is very educational.  Somewhat boring to the above 8 year age but sends the &#34;go green&#34; message for sure.  Even my 4 year old got it.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) is a well spoken bounty hunter who acquires Django (Jamie Foxx) to find and kill some men who are wanted, \\"dead or alive.\\" Dr. Schultz isn't too keen on the \\"live\\" part.<br /><br />The film divides itself into two parts. After the bounty hunting episodes are through, our duo conceive a plan to rescue the wife of Django (Kerry Washington) by purchasing her from Candie Land plantation. Dr. Schultz has no stomach for slavery or slave owners. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't enter the film until the second part.<br /><br />Like Tarantino films it incorporates humor. The bag over the head scene was reminiscent of something we might have seen in \\"Blazing Saddles.\\" The flashbacks are minimal and not confusing. There is of course the over the top climatic ending and plenty of blood.<br /><br />I have to question the use of the MF bomb several times in this picture. The first know usage of the word is the 1930s. It is speculated the phrase originated during slavery as a way to describe white owners who would take black mothers as comfort women. The phrase would of had a specific meaning and not used in the generic sense that Samuel L. Jackson tossed about.<br /><br />Tarantino fans will not be disappointed. Great sound track.<br /><br />Parental Guidance: F-bomb,N-word, nudity (Kerry Washington). No sex. Killing and slow motion blood splatter.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really Good! Kept me guessing the whole time. It was a fast and addicting read. I definitely recommend this book!
1451695195|1.0|A unique perspective on near-death experience from a neurosurgeon who previously scoffed at the idea that a spiritual life beyond the veil had more than a scientific basis of explanation.  The elimination of a framework of any religious belief system gives credence to his personal experience rather than proves it deficient.  His personal journey is written in a flowing, descriptive, and even - at times- humorous perspective which makes it a quick read that leaves the reader thirsting for more. It is a wonderful gift for bereaved families.
0517548232|1.0|When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great conclusion to the Helen trilogy. Could not put it down. This trilogy showed a more human (normal) side to Pendergast. Nice to see that even the super cool, calm, and collected special agent can get a little deranged. Can't wait for the next one.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoy this show. I like the characters and the setting is beautiful. I like how real problems come up and are faced with a decency and common sense that is missing today.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I loved this movie & love the soundtrack.  My family is getting sick of hearing one song played over & over again, but I love it!
0345803493|5.0|This has been on the best books I have read in a long time. I love it. I will recommend for people to read it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! I so enjoyed the conversations between Sky and Holden. So wise beyond their years.  Can you be this intuitive at the ages of 17 and 18?  I think it would be rare at any age. However, it was an enjoyable read. The characters were well developed. I felt like I knew them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the big numbers! So handy also! Easy to swicth for larger math problems. Will be using this a lot in the future.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I love this movie.  Never realized what it was about. I recommend it highly.<br />Some scenes are for mature audience only!
B0041QSZJM|5.0|you'll love their Christmas album.  They sing some new songs that I've never heard of and some traditionals as well.
B0026KZ412|5.0|Loved this movie.....especially the love story part.  Tom Cruise is at his youthful best, and Renee is a perfect gal for her part.  Her little son steals the show.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is truly amazing.  I thank Dr. Alexander for sharing his experience.  For anyone who doubts life after death read this book.  It is a scientifically spiritual validation.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this movie, but I was genually entertaint. The character is a lot closer to the comic book version, miles apart from the Stallone movie. Very gory, much more than what I like, but that is Judge Dredd.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|It was the must boring movie I ever saw.  You should have give us a FULL MONTY of channing Tatum just because we watched this stupid idiotic movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I think the details went on too long, I kept waiting for something to happen and 20% of the way done with the book I finally gave up, it just didn't capture my interest.<br />I think I'm alone in thinking this way because the reviews raved about this book, I'm 29...maybe too old for it?
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|DO NOT PURCHASE THIS... AS OF 1/14/13 YOU CAN WATCH THE FIRST TWO EPISODES FOR FREE ON THE PBS WEBSITE!!!!!  (I'm sure they will post new episodes as well.)  [...]
B000JLPMPS|5.0|One of the great westerns. Filmed in pristinge national forests, the scenery is breathtaking in Blu-Ray 1080p high definition detail.

0765325950|5.0|I cant believe its over. I read the first book when I was maybe ten and I still remember renting all the books from the local library. Chewing through them time and time again trying to get a better grasp of the story. This book definitely ranks next to Ender's game and The LOTOR series as some of the best books ever written.
B004QL7K70|5.0|I thought the movie was good and it came on time and it was funny to watch and I really liked it
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW, know I have to read the last book. The first book was not as good as I thought it would be but the second book is amazing. The books seem to get better as they go, hope the last is even better.

0345803485|5.0|i usually just read trending books so i know what everyone's talking about. but after reading this i just had to buy the second book, and the third. i don't know what drew me to it to be honest, but i couldn't stop reading. the smutty scenes did get a little boring and i ended up skipping most of them to get to the plot, but maybe i just wasn't in the mood.
142314189X|5.0|I bought the books for my 10 year old son to read them we saw the movie. I did not know he had read the series at school it didn't matter; he had two and half weeks off for Christmas and he read them again.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|i am so happy that phillip phillips doing incredibly well with this cd.  he is amazing!!!  from american idol to complete idol!!!!!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I didn't bother watching the old Judge Dredd. Newer movies are better at making the future look good anyway. It bothered me a little that we never saw Dredd's full face - it made him seem like he was supposed to be a generic character. His overly breathy/creaky voice (like a character out of a 1940s film noir) furthered the impression. Maybe that's what they were going for?<br /><br />The rookie cop is pretty easy on the eyes. We never see her wearing the judge helmet. There is some plot device about it making it too hard for her to use her senses. This works out okay, because there is only so much emotion Dredd can pump out without us being able to see his eyes. She also figures out pretty early on that Dredd's primary motivation is that he's a psycho. This is not surprising, given what he spends all day doing, and his permanent frown.<br /><br />The environments are nicely put together. If you want to spend a while looking at the dystopian future, this is worth a rent. Since they put some effort into making the graphics nice, get it in HD if you have something capable of 1080p. I wouldn't outright buy it unless you're seriously into this kind of thing, though. It's entertaining, but not thought-provoking, so it doesn't really invite me to watch it again.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I love this musical. The dancing and singing I could listen to everyday. I am so glad to find this on DVD.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Since I saw both the movie and the play, I wanted to see how closely they followed the story in the book.  I think the book is better than either.  Told from the horses point of view, the story gives at moving look at the lives affected by war, both human and animal.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Why the Hell would I pay for the DVD, when I can watch it completely for free, online?...there are a number of websites/links that dont even require free or paid memberships to watch movies just a couple of months after they've been released. I dont bother paying 10-12 bucks to go to the movies....I just wait for them to be accessible online.<br /><br />I liked this movie. And I love Greek mythology...so this was right up my alley. Mickey was a scene stealer...
B003UAMWWQ|3.0|But not so much for 2013, unless you are 17 or younger.  If you remember this movie fondly as a kid from the 80's leave the memory alone and go read a book :)
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book will keep u on it feet at all times! This is a book that u could read over and over  and still get  goosebumps
B000FC1192|4.0|Very dark and charming. Gaiman weaves an intriguing and intricate world that will be engrossing to older and younger readers alike. Film is also very good in its own right.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I haven't read any other books by this writer. I found this one to be reasonably easy to read but not rivetting. It addresses the problems of addicts but not in great depth. I'm not sure that it as easy as the writer seemed to make out to recover from addiction.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|great reading, once i start a book it is hard to put it down, the Harry Bosch series are great reading
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app it is so helpful. It have some different thing to help you. It has color code, different times and hoe often you need this in your calendar. Tap the day and it shows you what's on that day. I have nothing bad to say about this app at all.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i would and have recommended this series to my grandchildren as i have read all the books and find the stories very interesting
B008476HBM|5.0|It was a good book and i enjoyed it greatly. I read it to help myself when i take the AP test in the spring for english.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Thought it was a very good movie due to seeing some of the older &#34;Action Heroes&#34;. Guys like Stallone, Willis, etc show they still have the stuff to make good movies.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game great graphics. I love everything about this app. Once and a while it cheats,but I still recommend it to anybody who is adventurous and loves challenges. I love it! Totally sarcastic!
141659521X|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but, it has held my interest. Mr  Flynn has not written a bad book. His Mitch Rapp series is the best. I like when the good guys win,and, Mitch takes to it the enemy with no-holds-barred. Thank goodness he is on our side.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|this is a fine fat piggy of a book ... I'm sure GRRM laughed all the way to the bank ... it is an incredible 346 pages stretched into 1016 pages. Tons of cliff hangars and Tyrion emerges as a real favorite ... Liked it and alternated between suffering through it and racing through it. It is a book in desperate need of editing. True fans and members of the cult will enjoy it. I have mixed feelings about it even though I enjoyed oh say 400 pages or so of it. Ah, it's time to stop introducing new characters and to find a way to end it. And, therein lies the rub. I am not sure GRRM knows how he will end ths thing. More than anything I hope he will spare us the wights err zombies err frozen dead.
0345803507|5.0|Nothing I would change the book was exciting, fun, different from anything I have read all the books from this author was very good it kept me reading. A very good book thank u
1423124111|5.0|This book is more than just a compilation of the posters from the parks.  There is loads of information about the history of the posters, their significance to the success of the parks, and the process through which the designs went to become the final product.  I already have one poster from WDW on my wall, and this book has helped me to realize that I will be buying at LEAST two more when I return for another visit.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow.. ok where do I even start!?? I really don't even know!<br />Ok, so from the first page I was hooked till the very last page of this book it was really, really good. I don't want to use the word amazing and if you read the book you will understand why. The story was twisted \\"love\\" story I guess. Can you call it that? Nick's wife Amy goes missing and Nick is accused of killing her. You get to read the story from his point of view and Amy also has chapters, things she has written in her diary. ( I don't want to spoil anything).<br />Really, really hard to write this review without spoiling anything! I will say that I am not sure if I liked the ending or not but it fit. Other then that you need to read this book! Was so good!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|An action-packed, roller-coaster ride.  However, it deals with a mature topic, the underground sex trade, so may not be appropriate for teens (or younger).
1603400494|5.0|Classic book is always a great read.  I ordered for my son and read it after he fininshed with his reading.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is nonfiction but reads like a novel. It has heroes and villains wrapped in an exciting &#34;plot&#34;.  The idea of these mythical runners, doing things in a natural and human way, is compelling. This book acts as a guide for runners who have been battling injury due to improper form and ill-conceived equipment.  In addition, there a number of compelling characters each with their own quirks and idiosyncrasies.  Love it!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Order one for my daughter for Christmas but i loved it so much I'm actually ordering another one in a different color this time for myself!
B006LSZECO|3.0|i wanted to read this book since it is popular.i liked it but thought the last part was on the stupid side.it just had a disappointing ending.
B009P13RQY|5.0|If you want to drive your '74 Trans Am through space and into the sun, you'll find yourself wishing this was available on 8-track..
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Catch fish, eat people, avoid obsticals (mines/tiger fish/jelly fish). Soooo much fun! I love jumping out of the water to catch birds/jumping on boats to eat people. Course the main objective is to grow up to a much bigger fish, eventually &#34;evolving&#34; to a better fish all the while having &#34;objectives&#34; and &#34;missions&#34; to accomplish!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|A basic calculator, visually very nice, but as previous reviewers have noted, uses an inordinate amount of memory. I uninstalled it for a more efficient one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. I'm a really light sleeper but when this is on not even a siren could wake me up! Tell me what your favorite combinations are!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A very good read.<br />As a \\"fix it myself\\" type I enjoyed the problem solving survival adventure.<br />No magic or time travel required.<br />And remember to keep a spare roll of Duct Tape handy.......
B00AE6SS5O|4.0|I love hidden object games.  In addition to the great graphics, the fun and quirky plot twists kept the storyline moving along nicely.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book, Catching Fire, was just as good as the first book! I can't wait to start the third and final book.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a good app until you finish unlocking stuff then gets boring. I had to delete this because the lack of stuff to do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't like the ending but the book was really well written and very interesting.<br />Would recommend this book to my friends.
1601251505|5.0|Excelent purchase, specially for the old school D&D players that didn't like the 4th edition. Very nice improved rules for the 3.5.
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|So much good blues and what a price. I loved this one and I recommend it for teh others blues fans.
