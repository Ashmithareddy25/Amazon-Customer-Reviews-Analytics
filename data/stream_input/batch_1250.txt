B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. And I read a lot! My only critque is...  Wow! I can find nothing wrong with it! I love this book and especially the arena. Very descriptive and I would commit suicide right on the spot if I had to go into any of the trials... It's that freaky. ;)
B005FUTBV4|4.0|Spoilers ahead.  Director Kevin Smith makes a wide departure from what we can usually expect from his indi-films with this far out quasi-religious expose.  Take one part comedy about teen boy hormones, one part teen horror, one part psycho-thriller, one part drama and one part preachy politics and mix thoroughly.  That covers most of the available bases and Smith does it pretty effectively.  Three horny teenagers decide to look up a woman they find on-line who agrees to have sex with them all at the same time.  On the way there they argue about who gets what body orifice (yeah pretty disgusting and funny at the same time).  After they arrive they are drugged and taken to a church outside of town where a preacher (very scary, very effective Michael Parks) holds them captive for a later killing &#34;in the name of God&#34;.  This is one of those preachers who pickets funerals of soldiers, gays and other minorities.  As someone says &#34;even the Nazis have disavowed them.&#34;  In reality although a true believer, he and his minions are also armed to the teeth and ready for battle.  A local sheriff (Stephen Root) learns of the kidnapping by way of a ridiculous subplot and calls in the ATF.  The local office is run by John Goodman.  Through a comedy of errors, a decision is made to wipe out the church leaving no survivors so as not to have witnesses of the mistakes.  This includes the hostages and small children.  Smith pulls no punches and there is genuine tension as the 3 boys attempt their escape.  The resulting gun battles feel damn real and they are quite violent.  He also doesn't exempt likeable characters from getting wacked.  &#34;Red State&#34; is an out of the ordinary thriller with a small budget.  It's not for everyone but I thought it to be very effective.  The Blu-ray transfer is very good.  The HD-DTS surround sound is well placed and very noticeable during the ATF's siege of the church.  Bullets are flying everywhere.
0312576463|4.0|OK, so I agree that Freedom may not be the best book of the decade, but I certainly don't understand why other reviewers are being so tough on it.  The poor reviews almost kept me from reading this book and I would have absolutely missed out on a great read if I had skipped it.  Now that I've read this novel, my opinion is that NPR-listening, Apple-using, New York Times-worshiping, Prius-driving liberals who live in excessively large houses that they overpaid for didn't enjoy being portrayed in the manner that Franzen portrayed them in this book.  Since these folks also probably make up the majority of the intended audience of this book, the novel is getting slammed with harsh reviews on sites like Amazon.com.  Really, it's an engrossing and well-written book that truly does a good job of painting a (very slightly satirized) picture of upper middle class life in the USA.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|This is a must have for blu-ray owners - what a great way to enjoy the Holidays. It's truly a beautiful work of art. ENJOY!
B0052T7ICM|4.0|Great music. Any fan of Rory Gallagher will enjoy this album. My review is centered around the sound quality of this CD. The remastered edition sounds fairly decent, but I find it to be overwhelmingly treble-heavy. The sound is basically good, but in order to truly enjoy this particular edition I would recommend playing it in a player with even the most basic of equalizers and toning the treble down a tad. Obviously you will have to fiddle about with whatever particular player you have to get the best results, but even using the manual equalizer function in iTunes (go to the View tab, click on Show Equalizer and then you can adjust it to your liking in the Manual mode) works wonders on improving the sound quality. Note that it doesn't sound bad in its original form and I definitely recommend the purchase, but its hard to crank it up in headphones without tweaking the sound with an equalizer. Also, as another reviewer has noted, the tracks on this disc are remixed so hold on to your LP if you still have one.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|I have really liked all their previous music but Not this CD. It is bland and monotonous. Perhaps they thought they were being experimental or avante garde, I dunno. Whatever it is, it just doesn't work. Not even one song stands out though some are slightly better than others. I've listened to the whole thing 5 times now but honestly I think I'd rather not bother with it anymore and just put in one of their old CD,s.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is the 4th version of Emma that I've seen and it is by far the best.  The 1972 BBC version never came to life.  The 1997 A&E version with Kate Bekindale ( or whatever her name is ) was mildly entertaining.  The American version with Gwyneth Paltrow was very good.  But this is the Emma to see.  It's funny and a great love story.  Teh actors are all good.  In case you don't already know the end, I won't give it away.  Emma is the one Jane Austen story that has a few surprises up its sleeve.
1593078684|5.0|I love this book. I bought this as a gift and wrapped it immediately but from what I saw it seemed so worth the price! The art is fantastic and one can never own enough Final Fantasy items. If you are a fan then you will love this book and appreciate its content.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the Fast and Furious trilogy, and I understand that the movie has what we call in Brazil: \\"the artistic right\\" to show things a bit different for the sake of a better result, but when you see the movie, please consider:<br /><br />- Rio Police cars are not Mustangs, Camaros or anything closer...these cars are way, way, way too much expensive in Brazil than they are in US, therefore you need to have some good cash to afford having one of those.<br /><br />- Yes, there is a lot of corruption in Rio Police, and the idea of a safe like the one depicted by the movie would only be feasible if it was sponsored by that guy...no, I'm not going to tell it...see the movie ^^. But anyway, it was a nice catch: I would never think about it...<br /><br />- If a \\"gringo\\" go to a favela and shows a handgun like that (well, first of all, he would never be able to get there the way he did...), no matter how big it is (the gringo and the gun)...he will LOSE it there...and get killed, of course (not necessarily in this sequence). So kids, don't try it there, OK?!<br /><br />Well, I've got a lot of fun watching the movie for the action, and laughed a lot remembering the scenes and writing down this review. It it great fun for everybody though.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I paid extra to get the Blu-Ray with digital copy, what a Scam.<br />I have purchased Warner Bros movies in the past with a digital copy and have been happy with them. I like being able to watch the movie from iTunes on AppleTV. With this junk they are trying to pass as a digital copy, you must have a Flixster app or some adobe software on you computer to view the downloaded movie. What a waste. I feel like I got ripped off by some scam artist, I guess I was, it was Warner Bros. To view the digital copy I am forced to give out more personal information to another company and then to click a release giving Flixster the rights to use any information about my viewing habit to whom ever they feel like selling the information to. I paid for this privilege?<br />Shame on you Warner Bros, you need to have some respect for your customers and put the real digital copy back, not this fake.<br /><br />Update: After seeing another post, I emailed Flixster support asking for an iTunes store compatible redemption code. The response was very quick and I did receive a code to download an iOS compatible version of this movie.<br />While I am not happy that I had to go to these lengths to receive what I had expected at the time of purchase, I am pleased and impressed that Flixster and their customer service was able to solve this issue.  Thank you.<br /><br />I am upping my rating to 4 stars. The movie is excellent, I am only reducing it for the digital copy issues.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Even if you never cared much about the \\"Harry Potter\\" movies this one is worth seeing/buying. A+ hit...out of the park! I was skeptical of these so-called children's books being produced for the big screen, at first. But after my nieces & nephews talked me into making the 90min. round trip to our local theater a few times, all of the sudden I was hooked. Nothing like LOTR's, but never was intended to be. This last chapter in the \\"HP\\" series has got to be the biggest surprise to me of all. I expected a freeze dried ending with a little icing on top (after DH1). Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.If you watch \\"DH1&2\\" back to back...this gives the viewer a better idea of what I think the screen writers are trying to convey and absolutely gives the movie more of an even flow from beginning to end. Sounds excellent... I have a Bose 5:1 surround system and for visuals a Samsung LN46A650 and the visual are also A+ for this very well done blu-ray. It really is a keeper. Oh almost forgot the extras...you will need plenty of time examine them all. The DVD is also a nice touch. Put the blu-ray disc up for big people and the DVD a little lower for small hands on our precious little ones...is that not what our lives are really all about...they are our future.<br /><br />Change is Inevitable, Growth is Optional
B004YJMQCS|1.0|I have a 3D TV and bought this Blu-Ray disc based on Amazon's product description that stated \\"To watch this movie in Blu-ray 3D, you will need a 3D-capable television that comes with active-shutter glasses and a 3D-capable Blu-ray player\\". When it arrived I was a bit concerned to see that it came with two pairs of red and green filtered glasses and there was no mention of 3D TVs on the box. There were two discs though, so I hoped one of them contained a proper 3D movie for 3D TVs - No such luck so I returned it, which to Amazon's credit, was a very simple experience actually. I just printed out a UPS return label from Amazon's website and dropped it off at my nearest UPS Store and hopefully they're paying for it. Amazon needs to change their product description otherwise they're going to get a lot of returns.

0446573019|5.0|Zero Day by David Baldacci<br /><br />Baldacci has a new hero, a new ethos and another, never boring cliff hanging, throat grabbing thriller.<br /><br />John Puller takes over for John Carr without a Camel Club or a gang of cronies.  Although Puller is dedicated Army, he runs without a safety net throughout the book.  The Army is his life and his passion is it's Criminal Investigative Division.  He is an elite Army cop and he is thrown into a situation involving mass mayhem.  Every time he turns around there is another murder.<br /><br />Puller ends up partnering with Sam Cole and the two of them bond through their mutual desire to find the perpetrators' of mayhem in an impoverished coal mining community in West Virginia.<br /><br />Once again Baldacci paints such a vivid picture.  He sets his stage with clarity and depth.  His characters are both larger than life and realistically human.<br /><br />I worked in an impoverished Appalachian coal community years ago.  Baldacci accurately captures the poverty and despair that often results from long term un or under employment.<br /><br />One can only hope that we see more of John Puller.  He was a complex, likeable character.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Interesting. Worth watching. Not entirely original at times but not copying. Twists and turns and interesting originality. Vague and not helpful? Trying not to give things away. Worth watching.
B005KMX866|5.0|Can't think of anyone else who could do these songs with the justice they deserve. It's like listening to the originals. He was made for singing these songs. Even the style in which they were recorded says \\"SUN\\" records. It's been ten years since Good Rockin'Tonite, the Sun tribute, and his excellent contribution(It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You). You sort of had the feeling that this cd would be in the pipeline eventually. I'm so glad he did it. It's wonderful. even his own song Live It Up fits in marvelously. One of the best albums of 2011. I'm so glad your Japanese landlady recognized the specialness of Forgot to Remember to Forget. Great Job Chris!
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I have heard of Charlotte Bronte's classic story JANE EYRE but have never read the book and I did not know anything about the plot. I don't know how much this film version follows the book, but I thought it would be interesting to get some idea of Jane Eyre.<br /><br />It's a different place and a different world in 19th Century England. Jane Eyre is an orphan living in an upper class household with her aunt and cousin. Her uncle is her blood relative and he has passed away. There is no love between Jane and her aunt and Jane is sent away to a dismal sort of reform school. She eventually becomes a governess under the employ of a mysterious wealthy employer, Rochester, subject to mood swings. No surprise that they are oddly attracted to each other.<br /><br />Jane Eyre and Rochester are both portrayed as plain and ordinary in appearance but both have a hidden beauty that is hidden under layers of sadness, loneliness and desire. JANE EYRE is an interesting study in how relationships develop despite major obstances such as class differences.<br /><br />Judi Dench is always at her best in a period piece. Her role is small but a kind force in Jane Eyre's maturing as she lives a life of independence. The story does seem to move slowly as the mysterious unfold. The cast is great and the scenery and costumes are magnificent. It is an enjoyable film for a quiet evening.

0385535139|5.0|How to describe The Litigators? Think of the Broadway version of The Producers, with Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, and, perhaps, Jon Lovitz. Lane and Lovitz would be perfect in the roles of the aging Oscar Finley and the somewhat younger Wally Figg, a pair of Chicago ambulance chasers. Broderick would be perfect as David Zinc, a thirty-something lawyer who burns out of and ditches his position at a high-powered firm, and following drinking spree, finds himself employed by Finley and Figg. It's another world, where there are no ethics, few clients, little income, but plenty of sleaze. When Wally latches on to a get-rich-quick lawsuit against a major pharmaceutical company, all three attorneys are in over their heads - way over.<br /><br />Veteran writer John Grisham reveals his funny side in this book, which approaches the farcical. The action takes place on the seamy streets and in the high powered courtrooms of mass tort litigation, i.e., where thousands of claimants sue major corporations, and the biggest winners are their lawyers. Think of all those TV commercials, in which an earnest attorney assures viewers that \\"it's not about the money, it's about accountability.\\" This book is populated by dozens of colorful characters: Finley and Figg's street smart office assistant, the obligatory bimbos, the punk who tries to torch their office and then sues them, and the gorgeous shark of a corporate litigator who never loses a case. But there are also characters such as the Burmese immigrants whose child nearly dies from lead poisoning. Best of all, there's an idealistic young lawyer who finally finds his niche.<br /><br />The Litigators is a sharp, smart, amusing novel. It's slow to take off, but once it does, it provides its readers with quite a ride. Once, again, Grisham comes through.

B001VZY4M8|5.0|Who has a more distinct voice than Neil Young? Who is able to combine folk music with crunching guitar rock better than Neil Young? Still going after more than four decades his best days are behind him but he was able to remain relevant longer than most of his contemporaries. \\"After the Gold Rush\\" was recorded in 1970 after his work on CSN&Y's \\"Déjà vu\\" and before the seminal \\"Harvest\\" which made him a bona-fide star. The title track, \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" and \\"When You Dance...\\" were the hits while \\"Tell Me Why\\" and \\"Southern Man\\" (the song that Lynyrd Skynyrd fans love to hate) also got a lot of play. The period (1969 to 1972) represents Young's peak of creativity and this record captures Young right there. I only wish that \\"Till the Morning Comes\\" was a complete song instead of a 1:28 chorus. But, the record as a whole is wonderful and deserves a place on any Top 100 album lists.

B0067H9W72|2.0|Which sucks, really, that less than good has become the average for this series.  TV and comics spoilers to follow.  Yet again, I watch this show for one reason only: zombies. Here they make an appearance, but it's late in the first half, and then it's a weak attempt. I guess a stupid creature might just start gnawing at the first available limb, boot or no, but  wouldn't it naturally try different areas until it hit flesh? This one is wrestling with Daryl's boot enough to wake him before he beats it down (awesomely, side note).   After the end of the last episode I was so psyched to see Merle in action again. But then it's just a hallucination. And a two-handed one at that. That's just weak. And why wouldn't an experienced woodsman who is seriously wounded simply travel downstream instead of attempting--twice--to scale a dangerous cliff?  I get that Andrea needs a set-up to make her the wicked sniper she is in the comics. But in this particular case I can't imagine ANYONE, new to guns or not, thinking they're so cool they can shoot BETWEEN their own guys in order to take out a walker. She hit Daryl in the head as Rick and company were talking to him. So they were standing between her and the target. She shot through them, knowing a gun shot is a dinner bell, and seeing them already surround the problem. Someone needs to take that rifle and pistol whip her with it.  Herschel is upset about a missing horse? His family is keeping a horde of trouble in the barn not three hundred yards from where people are camped! And he doesn't share this? Of course people will go exploring, who wouldn't? Speaking of, wouldn't you secure some spikes in the ground surrounding your tent, or hang bells or something as an early warning system? It's not like the farm is heavily defended. Or really at all, as Andrea wasn't assigned sniper position, she just went up there on her own.  Sadly, this somewhat follows the comics. I think the difference is in comics you can imagine away anything missing from the story between the panels to justify actions. With TV you're seeing real people in these situations and you can't help but think, no wait, nobody is that dumb...  Again, sad that this series has established itself as sub par. Maybe it's a good thing that Darabont left. He certainly isn't going out on a high note.
B004HO6I2O|1.0|I find both Jason Bateman and Ryan Renolds to be pretty funny actors, so I was really looking forward to this movie.  Ugh... did not like it.

I couldn't care about either character, or the plot or what happened......  I wouldn't waste your time....

B001PU8N0I|5.0|I loved this and had never seen or read before.  Matthew MacFadyen is great in this and the story so interesting.
B005RUV6RO|5.0|As a person who is far from a fan of anything gory or horror related, this series is amazing. I love it. Creepy, gross, scary, yes, in my opinion. But unlike most TV Series or Movies of this genre there is such an excellent story.<br /><br />The characters are developing in a wonderful way (some flashbacks in the style of LOST). To me it's not so much a series about zombies, but of family, hope, & what people choose to do when faced with life or death decisions that must be made day after day, for themselves, their family, friends, or those they have come to feel a responsibility to. It's a story about survival and the choices you have to make to do it. Excellent!<br /><br />With that said, I am a bit let down by season 2 for some reason. It is still very good, but it lacks something the first season had... what?... I'm not sure. Maybe as others have mentioned... not enough \\"walkers\\"? I actually find it strange I think that, but I believe it's true.<br /><br />Still The Walking Dead is a must see series, if you can stomach it. And if you're a huge fan of LOST and Prison Break like me, you must see this.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I bought the watch as a birthday gift for my husband. His excitment was short-lived. As soon as we turned it on, the watch malfunctioned - menues went wild, nothing was working. We thought maybe a reset would help - but no.....the watch simply dies out and could not be turned on again.  I live outside the US - so returning the watch to Amazon quickly turned out to be a non-option. I turned to the local representative of Garmin and... surprize: global warrenty is not so global in some cases.  Eventually I had to contact the UK customer service, who were very helpful and efficient. I sent the the broken unit, and got a new one back after 14 days.   To sum up the experience: 2 thumbs down for Amazon, 3 down for Garmin \\"Global\\" warrenty and 3 thumbs up to the Garmin UK customer service center.  now, over a month after he got his present, my personal champ can finally enjoy his watch and he loves it.  it's a great product, as long as it's working.
141690977X|4.0|This is one of those classic books that any teenage girl and young woman should read. It is not only funny and entertaining to read, but it also cuts the crap that we women use to cheer ourselves up when dealing with a guy/man we fancy/love and get nothing in return.<br /><br />Women tend to support each other in relationships and emotional crisis, which is wonderful, and to think the best of the guy we fancy. However, but by doing so, sometimes we contribute to spread a crappy fantasy that does not help us to get over a crush or love, gives wings to guys who are not worth of our attention, so we miss the good ones.<br /><br />This book does not blame anybody, does not force you to do anything, fake anything or change who you are. It tells you to get on with your life because if he really likes you, he will do the impossible to get your attention and make sure you notice that he likes you. It sounds very basic common sense but we women tend to be nonsense when emotionally loaded, no matter our intelligence or common sense in other aspects of life.<br /><br />One of those self-help books for women that every woman should read at an early age. The sooner the better. It helps to move on quicker from those guys who do not move a finger for us and that we always try to excuse, and open the door to those good ones out there. Men, not boys. Good men, not creeps.. Simple!<br /><br />I have experienced in my flesh that the book really hits the point. Even with guys I doubted myself I ended reminding myself that oh yes, HJNTIY got it right again.
0765356139|5.0|WOW!!!  I thought the first book, [[ASIN:0765350386 Mistborn : Final Empire Series (Book #1) (Mistborn, Book 1)]], would be near-impossible to top - but Sanderson sure did the job with this book, the second in the Mistborn trilogy.  There's action, suspense, and surprises all along the way in this one.  I loved the expanded role of Elend Venture, and the relationship between he and Vin.  I love how Sanderson continues to flip the fantasy genre stereotypes on their heads - this time answering the question, \\"Ok, the bad guy is gone - now what?\\" in all sorts of interesting and surprising ways.  There is more great allomancy fueled action in this book, so this won't be a disappointment to those who prefer a healthy amount of action in their novel.  The plot is also filled with lots of tension, as the city of Luthadel is beset by 3 armies, all three of which are ruled by folks that are treacherous to deal with in one way or another, and all of which the reader can not wait to get their come-uppance, just like the Lord Ruler in the first book.  I could go on and on about this book - but I'll keep it short - if you like the fantasy genre at all, you must read the Mistborn Trilogy - and this book - you won't regret it!  This is the shortest 700+ pages I've ever read, it's that good.  I can't wait to read the next one, but it's bittersweet that the trilogy will be coming to an end.
B003W16T9K|4.0|This set seems to be a little maligned as of late. So praised by Gramophone when it first arrived, now critics such as David Hurwitz don't seem all too fond of it, saying the last symphonies lack fire and that the playing is dull throughout. For my part, I think it very much deserved the awards it won in the late '80s and believe Abbado's cycle to be up there with Blomstedt's and Marriner's as the very best. Blomstedt holds the slight edge in drama with the Unfinished Eighth and Great Ninth but Abbado, consistent with the chamber symphony style, makes a persuasive case for the Classical approach with both works. Schubert, after all, was a transitional composer, like his hero Beethoven. It is mistake to play the works of both composers in a fully Romantic vein, I'd argue. I have never been very fond of big orchestral approaches to these symphonies. Marriner also had limited forces in his cycle, which greatly helped. Blomstedt is the only composer who has played these works truly effectively with a full modern orchestra, to these ears. Thus, the big plus of Abbado's set is his use of the sparse Chamber Orchestra of Europe. These works can easily drown under larger forces. Abbado's orchestra brings a most satisfying, balanced timbre to the whole enterprise, and the space to breathe allows us to hear the subtleties of Schubert's scores.<br /><br />Of course, at the head of it all is Abbado himself, who gives intelligent yet intuitively pleasing readings of all the works. His Fifth is my personal favorite performance of the symphony, as a matter of fact. Too often that work isn't done true justice--even though one would think it'd be difficult to mess up. Again, the size of modern orchestras is a large factor. Here Abbado plays it like the wonderful, small-scale classical work it is, stately and sprightly. The rest of the set is of comparatively high quality (even if I'm not the biggest fan of some of the works themselves, such as the first three symphonies; Abbado makesa good case for all of them). From 1-6 he very eloquently walks on the side of classicism, but for the last two he switches to the in-between and strikes the perfect balance between that and pathos. Here I may prefer Blomstedt's slightly more powerful yet just as elegant accounts but again, those are with a large orchestra. Abbado colors in a number of details that other modern performances miss, and I really enjoyed that.<br /><br />For a more authentic Schubert, played extremely well, this set is the one to get. I would recommend pairing it with Blomstedt's modern approach with the Dresden, which is my favorite overall cycle.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Oh man, what a blast this collection is. Over 26 hours, albeit with non original music (I think the theme song is real) to avoid huge royalty payments. Nonetheless the writing and character design is as great today as it was back then.   Like Daria and Quinn this show was the polar opposite of B&B. While I would love to argue that bringing back that stupid show should be balanced by bringing Daria back, I can't see how MTV could reprise this kind of quality writing.  It would be relatively easy to do stupid, but Daria was smart, snarky and sooooo hot...
0380486032|4.0|Rebecca was required reading for me in either junior high or high school. I honestly cannot remember.  It started out very slow and was hard to get in to because some of the writing does drag on, but it eventually pulls you in.  I remember being so surprised by the ending.  I re-read the book several years later and found just as good as the first time.  This will always be one of my favorite classics.
B005VJ8ATS|2.0|This movie, for better or worse, seems to be meant for a different audience than it sells itself to (which no doubt explains the poor box office).  I can forgive some literary liberties being taken with science or realism in the name of entertainment and/or moving a story along.  Dropping an earth-sized planet into space close enough to be seen larger than the moon while not wrecking the planet and climate is science to make Star Wars look like a documentary.  Having it populated by duplicates of us is...I actually have some odds around here somewhere, and astronomical doesn't even begin to cover it.  This is more like an alternate dimmension (think Sliders or the Star Trek - Mirror Mirror universe).  They could have saved their special effects budget, too.  So the movie has made (in my thinking) two crippling scientific blunders while simultaneously missing an obvious and easy alternative, and NOW it wants to get cerebral.  My first thought is, \\"why should I believe what you have to say about the human condition when humans are far more complex than gravity, and you can't get gravity right?\\"    Then I watch Brit's character's mistake and her attempts at making things better, and I don't believe her path represents most people. I do not want to spoil the movie that so many people are enjoying, so how can she be in THAT relationship keeping THAT secret? She seems to be self-destructing slowly, and it almost seems to me like her path through her supposed redemption is simply more of this. The 'twist' at the end reminded me of M. Night (the bad), only not as well done. As much as I would say on it, I can't without spoiling it.  People call this movie 'thought-provoking,' and if you count thoughts like \\"Why wasn't this better when you had so much to work with,\\" then I suppose it is true.  The cast is solid.  The concept is interesting.  It just all seems to fall flat with me.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|- Jill, dangling Puss in Boots in the air: \\"Is it true that cats always land on their feet?\\"<br />- Puss in Boots: \\"No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!\\"<br /><br />He is sometimes known as \\"El Diablo Gato\\" or \\"Furry Lover\\" or even \\"Chupacabra.\\" But legend will call him \\"Puss... in Boots!\\" Those wondering how this spinoff movie will work out can rest easy. PUSS IN BOOTS isn't as emotionally rich, won't resonate as deeply as recent animated classics like the TOY STORY franchise or FINDING NEMO or even UP. But it is humongously diverting. It showcases Antonio Banderas in fine voice and at his most playful. And the script knows better than to engage in dropping tired pop culture references. You'll run across a few more familiar - okay, maybe tweaked - figures from them classic nursery rhymes.<br /><br />The story regales us with a tale of derring-do from Puss in Boots' past, before he met Shrek. An extended flashback sequence reveals Puss's origins, that as a kitty he was found at the doorstep of an orphanage in the dusty, sun-baked village of San Ricardo. There, he meets the bullied egg-child Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Their friendship and Humpty's obsession with finding the legendary magic beans provide the lynchpin of the story. The flashback also records Humpty's transitioning from good to rotten egg. Puss in Boots had always been prone to daring heroics and his glowing rep soon eats up Humpty. Eventually we witness their parting of ways. It's not on friendly terms.<br /><br />There's a lot of clever sight gags in this film. My favorite would have to be the marvelous dance fight between Puss and a rival masked feline out to poach his latest score. Is it stunt casting when Salma Hayek fits her role so perfectly? She plays Kitty Softpaws, thief extraordinaire. This marks the fifth pairing up of Banderas and Hayek (after DESPERADO, FRIDA, SPY KIDS 3D: GAME OVER, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO). Recall that Puss is not only a swashbuckling adventurer, he is also a notorious great lover. When his estranged childhood chum Humpty Dumpty tries to enlist him for an audacious heist, it's Humpty's partner-in-crime, Kitty Softpaws, who convinces an amorous Puss to sign up. And the caper? It concerns stealing the magic beans from those murderous married outlaws, Jack and Jill. And then it's up the beanstalk and on to the giant's castle to nab the golden goose.<br /><br />It's obvious that Banderas relishes spoofing himself. Puss in Boots is easily the most popular character in the SHREK franchise, and Banderas's charm easily carries the sword-slinging cat's solo outing, Latin machismo warring wonderfully with the innate cuteness of a cat in friggin' boots. Supporting Banderas and Hayek are some pretty solid names, Zach Galifianakis providing the voice of Humpty Dumpty, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as the felonious, southern twangy crooks Jack and Jill, and Guillermo del Toro as the village comandante.<br /><br />As in the best of these ventures, there's something for the young and old. Them kids will eat up the wild antics on screen while adults will appreciate the sly humor that sails over the four-year-old's head. Case in point, when Puss is tossed in stir and the jailer finds his catnip, Puss claims that it's for his glaucoma. Ha. The computer graphics are at such an advanced level nowadays that it's almost worth mentioning only when the work comes in below par. Suffice it to say that PUSS IN BOOTS, full of good humor and grand adventure, is a visual treat. Puss in Boots is never more in his element. It may be that I'll resent his playing second or third fiddle to Shrek from this moment on.torious great lover.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this app does the exact same thing as Quick Office Pro, but there are differences. for STUDENTS, get this app because it let's you change the spacing for APA and MLA format. neither app let's you add a custom header or footer, so a computer is necessary. neither does Tab for new paragraphs or hanging indented for works cited, so computer is also needed. but, those things are a quick fix up on the computer. if you are looking for an Office app, I would say go for this one just for the fact you can change spacing. I have both too. virtually identical. I like this one more.
B005LAIGFA|5.0|Paranoia.  Wiretapping.  A list of suspicious names that could threaten American security.  All these, if not all invented by J. Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI, were used to destroy lives during Hoover's career.   JEH is a loner both in his professional and personal life, but he does strike up a congenial relationship with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer), a debonair young man with a flair for fashion.  (In case, the viewer is slow, another character helpfully states that Tolson, \\"has absolutely no interest in woman\\".)  Tolson becomes Hoover's deputy agent and lifelong companion.  Together DiCaprio and Hammer deal with threats to the country's security, the moral decay of America, and really heavy makeup as they head into their golden years.  They both deserve Oscar nominations, especially Hammer.  I've seen criticisms that this film \\"softens\\" or \\"humanizes\\" Hoover, but I didn't have that reaction.  DiCaprio's Hoover is a thoroughly repulsive man.  He's a bully with a narcissistic streak, whose rare moments of self-doubt never yield any positive change in his actions.  He's a hypocrite.  He takes credit where it isn't due.  He's a more malevolent Harriet the Spy, whose response to anyone who crosses him is to compile a dossier.    The scenes where Hoover actually leaves the fortress of his office to track down the bad guys, such as the Lindbergh baby's kidnapping  seem cartoonish, and later the reason for that becomes clear.  At the end, I was left to marvel at how much self-deception one person is capable of.  DiCaprio and the other actors' old-age makeup gave me Mrs. Doubtfire flashbacks, but the cast (except for one guy who does an excruciatingly bad Boston accent) are great.  Judi Dench plays Hoover's formidable mother; Naomi Watts plays his devoted secretary who sticks with him until the end, even as Hoover becomes more racist and paranoid.  Dench and Watts, given much less screen time than Hammer, make the most of every scene they do appear in.  If during certain scenes, I pictured \\"Oscar clip\\" flashing a.l.a. \\"Wayne's World,\\" it was for a good reason.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I went looking for a new watch after the band broke again on my old Fossil Blue. I was on the Fossil site and stumbled across their automatics, which stoked my interest in automatic movements. After some research, I really liked the Hamilton Khaki King, but I didn't want to spend $350. So I kept looking for field watches and found these Seiko 5's. A bit more research turned up a lot of positive reviews and a few pictures of them on leather straps. So I pulled the trigger on the watch and a leather band with contrast stitching to cobble together the look of the Khaki King at a fraction of the price.   The great news is that after wearing the watch for a week now, it seems to only gain 2-4seconds/day, which is outstanding, especially considering the price. The watch is on the small side, but I'd rather have something a little small than huge like the fashion watches are trending these days. It has been a great introduction to automatic watches and looks good enough that I don't anticipate replacing it with a Hamilton even if I do decide to spend that much money on a watch some day.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The actual story was very good. A continuation of all the other Percy Jackson books by Rick Riordan, however I have never read a Kindle book with this many typos, and spacing mistakes. Overall, still an excellent purchase.
1250004217|4.0|I have to admit total ignorance of the Vel d'Hiv occurrence in history.  As always, the atrocities of war and what humans can do to one another is shocking and sad.  This story centers on the history of that event.  I personally liked the style of going from one chapter taking place in the past, and the other chapter occurring in the present.  I liked much of the book, although I can honestly say I did not like the storyline of the marriage in the present.  And I must say the author went a little overboard with the ending - but that is my personal opinion and really isn't a spoiler for the rest of the book.  I would recommend it to others but NOT as highly as the person who originally recommended it to me.  But the history lesson was very enlightening.
0307891372|3.0|I am a little disappointed in the guide, while it does seem to offer a wealth of information on items, quests and locations the font size is smaller then the Oblivion guide book and makes things harder to read in my opinion (plus the overall print size of the book is smaller then the Oblivion guide)   Plus the atlas is nice but half of the entries is just screenshots of the locations and I dont like that there isnt a section of just the main towns and cities first like in Oblivion and most of the city/town maps are small. Would be nice if for at least the major cities the map for those citys took up a full page or what.    Its an ok guide but I think the online map pack is better for viewing the maps in the game though its slow and sluggish for me. (wish it was an offline version) but this book is still good to have for refrence just wish it was a bit bigger (not content wise but size wise ) and had a more readable font. :-)

B00579EL18|1.0|It looked good on paper but a big disappointment. If you love Corelli in glorious voice and/or you must have every Don Carlo on disc then you will buy it. If you love the opera then run a mile.  Corelli is nowhere near the edgy, unstable Carlo that Verdi created. He is the macho tenor. He hangs on to top notes whether appropriate or not. He sobs and pulls his aria out of shape and doesnt seem to have understood that Verdi wanted Carlo and Posa on the same notes at the end of the friendship duet for a reason. Corelli hurls out a C which destroys the moment and doesn't even fit with the music. He does manage a couple of diminuendi but for little purpose dramatically. He causes a problem in the Auto-da-Fe by missing a cue, not because he had forgotten but because he wasn't even on stage. His contribution is an artistic mess if gloriously sung.   Herlea was an estimable baritone but with Corelli around he just sings out with little subtlety. He does indicate the trills without actually singing them and is generally loud and very loud    Tozzi is unsteady, sharp for the low notes and unfocussed for the high ones - a bland, forgettable contribution with his aria sold cheaply and without grandeur or grief.    Uhde's Inquisitor is woolly voiced. He struggles with the high notes and ducks the low one completely without ever sounding threatening.    Rysanek emits some of those famous high notes that make your spine tingle but elsewhere is in foggy and wobbly voice.    Dalis comes out well. Her Veil song is crisply sung with a variety of colours and pinpoint accuracy. Elsewhere she sings with dramatic thrust and puts many a famous Eboli to shape - but who buys the opera for Eboli alone?  The opera is cut and the conducting springs no surprises nor does it ever quicken the pulse.  As I say, if you love the opera then spend your money elsewhere.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|For full transparency, I'll state upfront that I currently work at MS and as a result, I'll judge the book mainly for the quality of the storytelling rather than larger subjective assessments.<br /><br />On the merits of Isaacson's writing and storytelling (and I'm a big fan of his), I thought \\"Steve Jobs\\" was a bit like a roller coaster ride.  There were some really good parts of the book, particularly in the sections covering his first tenure @ Apple and NeXT and Pixar period.  However, in many other parts of the book, it was evident that Isaacson and his publisher prioritized speed to market over the quality of the final product.  It is clear they wanted to get the book sold as close to Job's death as possible, preventing valuable editing and perspective that could have made this an exceptional biography of one of the most important people of our generation.  If one judges the book based on its ability to convince one of how visionary Job's was or his impact on business, technology and everyday life, sure the book works.  Given Isaacson's access to Job's and his family, he doesn't sugarcoat his character flaws and brings great insider perspective to a generally secretive personality.  Working in the technology industry, I easily devoured its contents, but based on the overall quality of the work, I'd judge it to be just average.

0061091480|1.0|I read this book when it was first published in the '70s.  A lot of it was helpful, but the best stuff had already been written by Dale Carnegie \\"Stop Worrying and Start Living\\" and \\"How to Make Friends and Influence People\\" in 1948.  Those books had many of the very building blocks upon which, subsequent \\"self help\\" books were written.  For example: \\"Live in day-tight compartments\\" or A person's name is the single most important thing to him/her.<br /><br />After reading \\"Your Erroneous Zones\\" I think I felt more confused than settled.  I was left with a background \\"noise\\" that said that the book, itself, was somewhat erroneous to me.  Then I read \\"Pulling Your Own Strings\\" by Dyer, which made me more suspicious of Dyer's approach.<br />For example, in the book, it seems that if your child goes running around a restaurant bugging people, it's OK and it is their own fault for \\"Feeling\\" bugged.  In other words, it always seems that, with Dyer, our feelings are invalid, especially if they're negative.  I found this very troubling.<br /><br />My more recent approach is to avoid most of the \\"self help\\" oriented books which actually sorta TELL you how to act or feel and substitute them with books that are a study on how the mind and brain actually work.  The more we understand how our minds work, the more we understand ourselves and, thus, address some of the problems we deal with that are so common in life.  That is, educate ourselves about how the \\"machine\\" works, then help ourselves by using our new knowledge, to control the \\"machine\\" better.  Education resulting in action is true self help.<br /><br />Some suggestions are:<br /><br />1) \\"[[ASIN:B003WUYRRM Rapt: Attention and the Focused Life]]\\" by Winifred Gallagher<br />2) \\"[[ASIN:0307377334 Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain]]\\" by David Eagleman (which, by the way, contradicts the Dyer idea that we have full control over our brain and feelings.)  There are lots of new things that have been discovered and tested in the 35 years since \\"Erroneous Zones\\" was published.<br />3) \\"[[ASIN:031254152X On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not]]\\" by Robert A. Burton, M.D.  It studies the very concept of how one feels right. (I purchased this book when I had reached my limit with an old friend of mine who is so sure of himself all of the time, but wrong at least half of the time.  But, it also made me take a look at myself and what I THINK I am right about.)<br />4) \\"[[ASIN:1886230854 Your Perfect Right: Assertiveness and Equality in Your Life and Relationships (9th Edition)]]\\"<br />5) \\"[[ASIN:073606270X Attention and Motor Skill Learning]]\\" by Gabriele Wulf) (Helps you understand how to best learn things like play the piano better and more accurately, play tennis, fly a helicopter, bat a baseball, etc.)<br /><br />Also, I have found that helping others and being kind to others gives me a good feeling and makes up for the times I feel I have not been treated well.  In other words, you can't change others, but you can add to the world in a way that cancels assaults from others.  In other words, if you don't like the way you are treated, make up for it by treating others better.<br /><br />So, although I feel that Dyer has the best of intentions and has, indeed, helped many people, he is no longer at or near the top of my list.<br /><br />Also, by studying the mind, I feel more empowered by being educated and can be my own doctor in most cases, not to mention, understanding why others behave the way they do.<br /><br />BUT, if this book works for you, GREAT!<br /><br />Cheers!ublished.  3) \\"[[ASIN:031254152X On Being Certain: Believing You Are Right Even When You're Not]]\\" by Robert A.

159102594X|5.0|Those of you who haven't read Mr. Abercrombie's dark fantasies are missing out on characters with real depth, not just cardboard cutouts of the typical hero/villain. The tale is gritty and gruesome and at times can make you cringe. There is also a twisted sense of humor that permeates throughout. Glokta is one of the foulest, yet somehow endearing characters ever put to paper. One of the funnest books I have ever read.

1933633867|5.0|Graeber's book is a monumental investigation of debt and money in terms of how these entities have actually existed in relation to each other over the course of history.  His investigations show that throughout history, there have been as many economic arrangements and monetary practices as there have been societies.  The modern world, in which one monetary regime dominates the civilized world, is an extreme anomaly in this regard.    Graeber demonstrates fascinating connections between commodity money and the institutions of military government, war, and slavery.  He recounts the rise of the creditor in European history (though with a disappointing vagueness as to the actual identities of these creditors).  In doing so, Graeber builds a compelling and overwhelming case that the modern monetary regime is an artifact of a specific set of historical circumstances (which in many cases are historical crimes) and NOT a natural product of financial and economic evolution.  Thus, the modes of economic intercourse and practices that our economists claim to be natural, efficient, and unassailable, when presented in their historical context, in light of their true evolution throughout the ages, betray a wholly different character, that of a capricious, arbitrary racket placed in the service of the elite classes.  This is the triumph of the book--that upon reading it the modern serf can look a his condition and see that there is nothing inevitable about it, and that those who claim that it is are liars.  Graeber wishes for his reader to realize that there is a universe of possibilities that are left untouched and unexamined in the official spectrum of policy which could be applied to building a better, more prosperous, more fair, AND more free society.

Lionel Logue, The Duke & Duchess of York and other leading roles were excellently cast.  The story of a monarch- to- be's stuttering difficulty was made interesting and believeable by the producer/director's strory-telling structure of letting the audience see the man's deficiency right from the beginning where he fumbles in his first public speaking event- - - -and later finds success with words in announcing to the English populace that the country was at war.  It's a good family picture and a great lesson in teaching young children to tolerate and not belittle individuals (adults or children-peers) with disabilities.

0062101897|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo4V68212KHFO9]]This book exceeded all my expectations, and it certainly befits the Harry Potter film saga.<br /><br />This is a large format 532-page hardcover. It's so huge and hefty so you can't really hold it for reading without resting it on something, like your lap. The cover is beautifully designed with an embossed title and a window looking at Hogwarts.<br /><br />There are three parts to the book. The first is \\"The Making of Harry Potter\\" and covers the complete film making process of all the seven Harry Potter titles. The second is \\"The Art of Harry Potter\\" and that covers the characters, locations, creatures and artifacts. The third is the epilogue. It took me several days to finish reading.<br /><br />I want to make special mention on the layout of the content which is beautiful and thoughtful. All the stunning photos and art are published at high resolution. On some pages, there are illustrations or patterns printed on a thin gloss that gives the page a slight shine as you flip over. The text is set on light cream coloured paper. There's an illustrated drop cap that starts every chapter, and every section in the chapter ends with a nice symbol. Even the choice of typography used is excellent.<br /><br />The first part featuring the film production stories are a joy to read. It starts right at the beginning, from getting the copyright to make the films, to casting and filming right to the last day. There are lots of interesting details to read about, such as interactions between the actors and film crew, how the stage and props are made and the challenges and considerations of filming.<br /><br />You read about how the children were like deers in the headlight on their first day of filming. There were extensive laughing, constant looking into the camera. As you read along towards the last film, you know how much they have grown as actors.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful. The author Bob McBabely is a master at weaving the stories, controlling the flow and transition from one section to another. There's a part where Emma Watson admits to having a crush on Tom Felton and in the next sentence Tom Felton says,\\"Poor Emma. Of course I knew; it was obvious. But I never mentioned it.\\". There amount of research and interviews done must be incredible. Every film crew mentioned are given introductions and a thorough background on what they do.<br /><br />The stories on set designs are really interesting. You can find out how sets are constructed, like Hogswarts and all the different rooms and secret locations. I thought the underwater scene in Goblet of Fire was totally CGI but it turned out that Daniel Radcliffe actually had to swim, while holding his breath, and act in a water tank. And of course, there are details on how that water tank was built, with heaters, bacteria-killing UV lights, and the little things that don't cross our minds.<br /><br />The second part of the book is sort of like the encyclopaedic look at the characters, locations and artifacts. There are staff commentary on everything.

Not only is it biased towards portraying a rather grandstand like attitude for Jobs, sentences like I am going to destroy Android are not apt for a publication such as this.

B005TQAI6G|4.0|I went to see Britney's FEMME FATALE tour at the M.E.N. Arena and enjoyed it for the most part and I'd recommend the DVD/Blu Ray release of the concert to Britney fans as most of the concert is live [the choruses of the dancier tracks and a few other parts are clearly prerecorded].<br /><br />But... I'll be honest and say that if you don't like Britney, then you won't think the concert is really anything to shout about; Some parts are clearly using prerecorded vocals, it is a fairly short concert [this is because some of the songs Britney performs are shortened] and it isn't as 'showy' and bright as most other pop concerts.<br />Britney also does not connect with her audiences very well; there was a few rehearsed \\"How you doing [insert name]?\\", but I don't think that counts.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Anyway, on to the music...<br /><br />Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is the highlight of the evening, as she does indeed perform it 100% live which shows that, yes, she CAN sing.<br />Trouble For Me and Till The World Ends are my favourite tracks on the Femme Fatale album and are great performed on stage, although some parts of these performances use prerecorded vocals.<br />Another must-see, for me, is when she performs If U Seek Amy. It's probably my favourite Britney single and her vocals are great on the live version. The classic single Toxic also has more zest to it when performed live and I love the oriental arrangements in this portion of the show.<br /><br />Another standout is when Britney sings her verse from the Rihanna S&M remix. It's a shame that she only sings her verse; it is short and I was left wanting more.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I also love that the tour has one solid storyline holding it all together; There is a total of five segments for the tour, portraying a story in which Spears is a secret agent, who is chased by a stalker. The first section of the concert consequently features her escaping from prison along with other female inmates.<br />The second segment begins with a video intermission in which a stalker reveals that Spears is a secret agent. A video interlude in which the stalker talks about femme fatales in history sees the beginning of the third section, which features an Egyptian theme with fireworks and acrobatics.<br />The fourth segment is preceded by another video interlude, featuring Spears changing clothes and choosing between different passports inside a hotel room. The encore begins with a video interlude of Spears capturing the stalker, and is followed by two performances in which she defeats a group of ninjas.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I've gone to watch all of Britney's world tours and have to admit that I was saddened to see that the rag mags are semi-right for once; although it's not as obvious as it is in her Circus tour, Britney does look robotic a lot of the time and her dancing does look somewhat stiff.<br /><br />I'm not having a dig at her herself, but maybe whoever is shoving her onstage should think twice, as she doesn't look comfortable and as if she's enjoying performing - she actually looked almost scared at times. For her Oops!

0307593312|4.0|Like some of the most recent reviewers, I have read all of Murakami's novels as well as his book on running. Though I think Murakami can't help himself (the way he writes, he sits every day until the novel is done and follows a muse of sorts), this book is too long. Don't get me wrong - it's still brilliant, gripping, imaginative - everything you've come to expect from Murakami. My favorite character wasn't Tengo or Aonemone, but rather Tamuru (and the dowager) - Tamuru's sense of competence mingled with sadness made him the most \\"real\\" person in the novel. The final 200-300 pages were gripping. The opening few hundred took too long to get the story going in my opinion. I also didn't think we needed as many pages on the death of Tengo's father in the sanatorium. But then again, one of Murakami's points is that WE are supposed to feel the characters' 20 year separation and in the process of plowing through almost 1000 pages, we feel like we've been on the journey for that long as well. In other words, I think Murakami wanted the novel this length and had not the slightest interest in cutting it. Luckily no single image was disturbing in the same way some of the images from the Wind up Bird Chronicle were - I still have nightmares about passages from that book.<br />By the end, I was totally invested in the culmination of what is at the heart a love story. Not a perfect novel, but one that kept me turning a lot of pages until the end. If there was a quiz on some of the plot details (who were the Little People? Why did the voice disappear? What was the image Tengo really saw from his childhood?) I think many of us would fail, but I don't think we are meant to get every single detail (although I wish I understood the significance of the photo of Tengo's parents and the baby - wasn't she strangled? Was it really Fuki Eno who was also straggled?) Maybe another Murakami fan will answer some of my niggling questions, but overall, the novel was a tour de force albeit with a few minor flaws.minor flaws.

0743270754|1.0|This is the worst best-selling non-fiction I've read. It's 900-pages. The author copies passages from historical republications, en masse, in the main text, rather than putting them in the footnotes. You end up spending hours reading hundreds of pages, and come out having practically learned nothing. I have trouble believing it is Barack and Hilary's favorite book; I do not believe they had time or patience to read it from cover to cover.
0756405890|2.0|My name is Kvothe. My awesome heroic account narrated by me is pure truth, I assure you. Do not worry folks. You're looking for a review. I'm giving you one. We'll get to that in a minute. But first, find some time to listen to me.<br /><br />You don't have time? What makes you think you can leave here, knowing what you know? (I said this exact sentence in my book.)<br /><br />Now you want to listen to me after I gave you a death threat? Good. When you take note, do not presume to change a word I say. (I also said this in the book!)<br /><br />I'm gifted. Not just gifted in one way, I'm gifted in every freaking way. I'm skilled with music, acting, medicine, chemistry, alchemy, things you might call magic. In fact, anything cool, you name it.<br /><br />When I was only about twelve, I devoured in months lessons grown-ups would take years to learn. I had flash-fast, word for word, page for page memory. They ended up paying me instead of charging me for tuition. I was the youngest in quite a while. In barely a week, I owned a teacher so hard, embarrassed him in front of the class, making him hate me for life. In return, I was punished unfairly but also rewarded with a rank students took years to earn - I only took a few days. I saved women. One of the most beautiful girls in the school even invited me into her room, which I refused, of course. I was too pure to do that. I bested my rivals every time we confronted each other, in this book, at least. They accepted me as one of the musical genius, and I was the youngest to gain that recognition, even after my rival played dirty and tried to ruin my performance. By hurting him, I earned another rank. And the best part is, it didn't stop there.<br /><br />You see, I was brilliant. Not just your run-of-the-mill brilliance either. I was extraordinarily brilliant. (I said exactly this in my book too. Word for word!)<br /><br />Not yet apparent in this book, but printed on the back cover, I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. My name is Kvothe, not Mary Sue. You may have heard of me.<br /><br />You see, I said I would give you a review, but I don't even have to. Because by the time you reach here, I'm pretty sure you get the point.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 was one of the best Stephen King books I have read (and I have read all of them)It was a great premise for a book and he wove the story absolutely beautifully. As usual his twists and turns couldn't be predicted (well some could!), and this made the book unputdownable! It is a long book, as most SK fans would know unless they are reading a short story his novels are big, long reads. Although I am Australian, I loved the idea of turning back time and stopping the assassination of JFK - but what would the future hold if this could be accomplished? I also love the idea that the past is 'obdurate' and doesn't want to be changed.  Well worth reading, and taking your time over it, don't rush it, enjoy every page, because every page is worth reading.  From a long time SK fan.
B0066KVTKS|5.0|This is one of the more light hearted episodes of Supernatural that they do so well. A welcome break after the last 2 petty intense, but excellent, episodes.

B003JTHESA|3.0|Maiden's 15th studio album is full of great musicianship.  We all know Maiden are really great when it comes to complex musical arrangements and \\"The Final Frontier\\" is just another example of how talented the boys are.  I've been a fan since 1982.  Is this the same Iron Maiden I grew up with?  No.  Although it is not, I still feel this is a decent effort after all these years and personell changes.  This band weathered the storm of the 90's and beyond and are still going strong.  Ah well...things change.  I must say, I do not like the album cover.  Oh, I think it's a cool concept but, Eddie does not look like Eddie to me.  I miss the old long white-haired corpse.  Or, when he was bald and they took his brain out and he had that clamp in the middle of his forehead.  One of my most favorite pictures of Eddie is the \\"Live After Death\\" album cover.  I'm sure most all of us have our favorite depictions of Eddie.  That one is mine.  It seems to capture what the band is all about.  Back to the tunes of \\"The Final Frontier.\\"  I like the first song once it gets going.  It takes a little bit for it to kick into gear.  I thought \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"The Talisman\\" were good, too.  No, it's not what I grew up with but, it's still pretty cool.  Kevin Shirley has been Maiden's producer for a number of years now and has done a top-notch job.  He is no slouch.  I miss Martin Birch, though.  Maybe he will come out of retirement someday and make an album with Iron Maiden again.  Along with Maiden, he also produced the lengendary Rainbow album \\"Rising.\\"  Plus, he worked with Black Sabbath a little bit by producing \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules\\" just to name some of his other projects.  All in all \\"The Final Frontier\\" is ok.  I really hate the album cover, though.
B0058ZPNOK|1.0|This film was far from \\"refreshing\\".  What ever happened to the decent things in life?  Hesher had a very BIG filthy mouth and so did the boy, therefore taking away any lesson there was to learn in this film...except how to have a filthy mouth and be violent.  How sad.  This film just gives people bad ideas of how to act!  Nothing they did was exceptable.  There are better ways to let of steam.  Just walking into someone's home and making YOURSELF at home...give me a break!  Hesher was filthy and discusting.  This was a very depressing movie. A waste of time.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I'm no stranger to hating something that everyone, especially critics, informs me that I should love.  Take, for example, my review of [[ASIN:B003ASLJO0 Gran Torino]].  I thought it was just awful, but I recently saw it appear on a critic's list of \\"best movies ever made.\\"  So I am sympathetic--to some small degree--with the people who gave \\"Tree of Life\\" one star and then panned the hell out of it.  You do have to go in knowing what to expect.  This is not traditional story-telling.  Not by a long shot.  It is dream-like, impressionistic, metaphorical, non-linear.  In less skilled hands it would be nothing short of a mess.  But as it stands, this is the most astonishing piece of filmmaking I've ever encountered.  From the performances of the young actors to one-of-a-kind visuals and soundscapes, this is art that can only be film.  The story in \\"Drive,\\" another great movie, or \\"Moneyball,\\" ANOTHER great movie--can and were communicated in books.  They could have been done on the radio.  \\"Tree of Life\\" can only be film.  What it conveys depends on well-chosen images, sounds, performances, and juxtapositions.  It is a masterclass in using the specific virtues of film to convey feelings and provoke thoughts.  That is not to say that I didn't grow impatient with \\"Tree\\" sometimes, or that I don't think I might have been a little happier understanding more of what the intent of certain things was.  And as a person with no supernatural beliefs, I was annoyed by some of the vague, New Age \\"spirituality\\" toward the ending (though I appreciated the boldness represented by some of the questions asked of God).    But do I think it was pretentious or self-indulgent?  Not really.  It was a particular vision that touched on big issues using unique methods from a singular perspective.  To a large degree, that describes all great art.  If something like \\"Tree\\" is criticized, as it is by many of the one-star-givers for being too artsy and dull, the suggestion would seem to be that wegive up on art altogether and focus exclusively on entertainment.  I love entertainment.  But I don't think a couple of hours of mild confusion and the need for rapt concentration is too much to give for a rich and provocative experience.  I confess that when I first started reading the one-star reviews, I wanted to dismiss all of them as having been written by Philistines and low-brow dimwits.  That's not fair.  Even among those who fancy themselves artsy, intellectual elites, \\"Tree\\" might land with a thud.  It's not for everyone.  But if you love cinema--not just a good story told on film, but the medium itself--and you love wrestling with existential and metaphysical questions, and you can appreciate great performances that don't necessarily add up to a traditional, linear narrative...don't be frightened off.    It's fine if you do end up hating it.  I promise I've gotten over myself and won't judge you.  I just think that a lot of the people who might turn away because of the almost even number of glowing and glowering reviews might be missing out on something that might have amazed and enriched them.
B004LROUNG|5.0|\\"You know what they say - the reason divorce is so expensive because it's worth it\\" Wally says. He is one of the many great characters that Grisham gives us in his latest book. Grisham has written a truly entertaining story, one that is full of morale without ever being moralizing. I can highly recommend it!
B005KDWUFA|4.0|I don't suppose it does anything for a guy's masculine credibility to admit liking this stuff, but...well.  In the right mood, this sort of overly dramatic, over-the-top take on some great songs like \\"Wicked Game,\\" \\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina,\\" and \\"Falling Slowly\\" are just the thing.    I'd never heard of Il Divo until they appeared on \\"Who's Got Talent?\\" last summer, and they did \\"Wicked Game,\\" a truly haunting song in the original by Chris Isaak that they covered with an operatic verve that gave me the shivers.  I'm a sucker for \\"big\\" music, from Guns N'Roses' \\"November Rain\\" to Meat Loaf's \\"I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That\\" to \\"'Lascia ch'io pianga\\" from Rinaldo.  This is lavish, sometimes doofy music-making, hammy but affecting.    Call it a guilty pleasure, but a well-harmonized and overly interpreted \\"Crying\\" sung in Spanish (\\"Llorando\\") is just what I'm in the mood for sometimes.  If you're man enough--or just sappy romantic enough--maybe you will be, too.  Some have commented on the less-than-perfect arrangements and musicianship of this recording, and that's probably fair to say, but the vocals are so much the star of the show that other considerations fade by comparison.  \\"Wicked Game\\" probably won't go into heavy rotation on your car CD system or anything, but as a pseudo-classical break from frothy pop, one could do much worse.

I can't transfer it onto my ipad2, or ipod, therefore, it is useless for me. I would have saved my money and bought the regular Blu Ray had I known this. I assumed that the film would be accesssable throught the cloud as well as being able to transfer it to my portable devices. Nope. I'm totally disappointed because I use my ipad2 daily and I travel for work, so I enjoy being able to have digital copies of the movies that I BUY ON MY IPAD! Having only cloud acces it useless for me. I signed up for both services, but will most likely not use them.

B005LAIGFK|5.0|A scene at a clothing store in which John Edgar Hoover is told he has bad credit finds him telling them that they are incorrect, they must be speaking of another John Hoover. They ask if he is indeed John Hoover and he says yes but adds that he signs his name different ways, not usually just plainly as John Hoover but with his middle name or E initial included (his mother did always call him Edgar). The shop owner then tells Hoover to open up a new account and sign it with one name and to go by that name. John takes the application form and writes J. Edgar Hoover.  To me this scene is symbollic of the larger film. J. Edgar Hoover is a film about a man who, like many of us, had many sides and aspects that composed who he was. He was greatly conflicted about which side he should portray publicly and stumbled rather awkwardly in his younger years, illustrated wonderfully in the film, until finally deciding that J. Edgar Hoover was who he was going to be. That was the side he was going to live publicly and the person he was going to be, right or wrong, with full conviction. The rest of the film shows us the consequent problems, struggles and complications that follow from this choice.  I was concerned that this film wouldn't live up to my expectations, others have been rating it rather ordinary and others negatively, few seem really excited about it after having viewed it. In a way I can see where they are coming from. It is a long film with dark moody colors, almost as if Eastwood wanted it to be black and white, and a lot of dialogue that moves quite fast without much regard for helping the audience along or spelling things out. All that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and while it didn't blow my mind or leave me with any great revelations about my own life it was a great movie experience and had me thinking and entertained the entire time I was watching it.   I'm not sure where all the more negative or critical reviews are coming from, perhaps people have highstandards from Eastwood and expected something groundbreaking, perhaps they just expected something different, but after all the negative or ho-hum opinions I had heard about this film I was pleasantly surprised and recommend it for fans of drama or biopics. I especially recommend it for those like myself who have been waiting for a more compelling film this movie-going season.  Perhaps I enjoyed it more because I have seen a truly terrible line of recent films in cinemas, Jack and Jill being the latest before seeing this (that movie was awful, so awful. I thought it would be bad but in an over the top funny way, it was just bad). So maybe my enjoyment was raised during this film because other recent films have left me underwhelmed and bored or wanting my money back. I haven't seen an excellently crafted film in theaters since The Help and haven't even thought one merited repeat viewings since the surprise that was 50/50. This film didn't knock me out but I will definitely watch it again and will likely even buy it on Blu-ray because I want it to be part of my collection and think it will become more engaging upon future viewings.  People are complaining about the old age make up, it never bothered me once despite other reviewer comments making me more critical than usual. People say there are many impersonations of presidents and such that are distracting, the only one that felt as much to me was Richard Nixon's brief appearance towards the end because it was so over the top. People say it drags, but I was never wanting for it to hurry or speed along, I was always compelled with what was on screen. There are complaints that the broken narrative is confusing and jumps too much, it's fairly straightforward with only two timelines occuring. Hoover in his old age is dictating his past for a manuscript and both these timelines are otherwise chronological and move forward with one another. People say there is no real message or overriding theme to speak of, I think deeper digging and repeat viewings will find them more well constructed than others are giving credit right now. Most of all though, even if some find merit to these criticisms I don't find that any of them would keep the film from being enjoyable as a whole.   This film may be getting less positive reviews because people thought it could have been so many things that it isn't. In the end I feel Eastwood and the writer picked a direction and identity for the film and much like J. Edgar they decided to move forward with full conviction. It is what it is and any negatives don't outweigh all the positives it brings in my opinion, but everyone will judge the film differently I suppose, much like everyone has different opinions on J. Edgar Hoover the man.  It may also help me that I'm very interested in history and this time period. Also in how institutions such as the FBI got built up and came to be (the film does an excellent job at explaining how the bureau slowly found ways to gain power and independence). Anyways, give this film a chance, I give it five stars because I may not have LOVED the film but I did love the experience of watching it, if that makes sense.
B000AP04NI|3.0|Tell us another one, Fox.<br /><br />The two filmed versions, the Todd-AO version and the Cinemascope version, are both the same age.  If it was possible to present a restored version of one, wouldn't it have been possible to do just as good a job on the other? Did the negatives experience time at a different rate, one aging worse than the other?  It's hard to believe if the right resources had been devoted to the Todd-AO version, it wouldn't have come out looking just as good as the Cinemascope version. Let us know when you're ready to release both versions in decent condition.

1451648537|3.0|Just finished the book -- took a bit of time, putting it down in the middle. But it was worth the read. I value that the author kept in the warts as well as the triumphs (as the triumphs would have not been as strong without the warts). Jobs was a force of nature, more so than a genius -- and he used his natural bully tactics to focus groups of people to produce things he liked....turns out, those things are things most of us would like to have, too: we just didn't have the platform, or the force of will, or the insight to get it done. Interesting to see what a flawed man he was, yet how much he truly accomplished and created. But he left a lot of bodies and damage in his wake as well. Sometimes it takes a hurricane or a flood to clear the land before something new can be built. Would have liked to know more about how his wife and kids truly felt about things -- but that is a minor criticism. For those who have lived over the past few decades, consumed electronics -- phones, computers, web devices, music, etc. -- it is always fascinating to see how that all came about, and the tensions and what-ifs. No great insight; more a morality play. But still, a great read.
0307477479|4.0|Structured like the excellent [[ASIN:0812971833 Olive Kitteridge]], A Visit From the Goon Squad's chapters are written from the perspectives of different narrators.  The characters' meet, interact and separate over decades.  What they all have in common is an authenticity that made me immediately feel I knew these people and their challenges and choices.  I read and read and read, so it is such a pleasure to come across a novel like this one that is fresh, relatable, surprising, sad, and funny all together.  An added bonus:  I learned something about the music industry (the music industry provides the stories' backdrop.)  If you enjoy contemporary, realistic fiction written in a straightforward, spare style, this novel is for you.

031261246X|5.0|Mark Russinovich writes an excellent novel based on a terrorist attack on the the computers and businesses connected to the internet. The scary thing is all the technology mentioned in the book exists today, the viruses, root-kits and such are in the wild and infect computers daily. At the moment this novel is fiction, but it could easily become fact in the near future. An excellent read even for those working in IT - the technical details used in the book are correct; they should be - Mark works at Microsoft as a technical fellow! Definitely worth reading.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|The movie is fantastic, but I am so disappointed by the \\"digital copy.\\" I loved that studios were providing a real itunes digital copy, even got one with Harry Potter 7.1, and I love it. But what is this UV crap? Streaming? Sign up for two accounts just to use it? Cannot download it to iTunes? Requires a specific app to watch on my iPad? Thank goodness there are ways to transfer DVDs to iPads. I never minded paying the extra premium to have the movie studio provide it for me, legally. Sorry WB, but you really screwed up with this one.<br /><br />Update:  Went to Flixster's website and submitted a feedback/contact message asking for an iTunes redemption code, they sent one back to me about an hour later!  That makes me happy.
B000J4OYTK|3.0|After reading the other reviews, I was hopeful this record would be THE definitive 'Tommy'.  And it would have EXCEPT for inconsistent vinyl quality. Side one has a grating sound, not quite a scratch as much as a scrape, for 50% of the side!  Unacceptable to me.  Otherwise, the sound is stellar.  That is why my rating is 3 stars instead of what should have been a 5 star rating!   I wish there were a guarantee of vinyl quality for these reissues.  After all, it is 2011 and there should have been quality control lessons learned by now.  Honestly, there is no excuse for this.  Japanese 'virgin' vinyl consistently performs better, of any year, vs. other countries of more current vintage.    I have seen other problems with the 200 gm. reviews of 'Tommy' too so it is not just the copy I purchased.    I also have the SACD version of 'Tommy' and vinyl STILL rules - there is no question that Classic Records paid a lot of attention to putting this album together, kudos for that.  However, whoever did their vinyl quality control could benefit from a similar quality concern to eliminate problems like these.    Recommended - with caution, because you will not know until you play it whether you got a good pressing or not...sadly.
B0041JMT82|5.0|I bought this book and the edging book by the same author.  I was hoping to increase my own creativity and start making my own patterns.  This book was very helpful to my mission.

I would purchase this book and the edging book in a heartbeat as gifts.

B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I've been wanting to see a Wolverine movie that lives up to how the man is the comics. Too many times in the movies, characters are watered down to make them more appealing to those who aren't into comics so much and, because of this, comic book fans(like me) feel like we've been cheated. Thankfully, X-Men Origins: Wolverine etches that much closer to what Wolverine is in the comics and that makes this movie worthwhile in my books.<br /><br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells the tales of how Wolverine came to be, with the story beginning in 1845. Young James Howlett sees his father killed by their groundskeeper Thomas Logan. This trauma brings about James mutation with bones protruding from his hands. He then proceeds to kill Thomas Logan. Before he does, however, Logan tells James that he is his father. He flees with Thomas' son, Victor Creed, who is his half-brother. That's where the movie begins. The conclusion is pretty epic, I assure you, but to find out- you'll have to watch the movie.<br /><br />In my opinion,this has to be Hugh Jackman's best performance as Wolverine. In what little time he's been Wolverine, he's taken the character and encompassed what he truly is. I know many were disappointed with this movie, in general, but I felt that it was a good(if not great) movie in the X-Men series(definitely better than X-Men First Class, even though this one came out long beforehand).<br /><br />I've read a sequel is in the works to this movie, simply called:The Wolverine. I've also read that the sequel might sport an R-rating. I'd really love to see that happen so that Wolverine fans can really see their beloved character 'cut loose'. I've only seen one other movie to ever really show a Marvel character for what it was and that was Punisher: War Journal(one I also recommend). Here's hoping we see it happen.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|... and I was.  Real synergy.  I didn't know what to expect, really, which was much of the fun of buying the cd.  I kind of anticipated some raw Lou Reed with the kind of punch only Metallica could deliver.  I wasn't disappointed.  Neither Lou Reed or Metallica are prominent in my music collection ... but something spoke to me when I heard about a Lou Reed with Metallica album and I anticipated a new experience.  I got it.  I don't understand the slamming of it ... personally, I can't wait to listen to it again. When Metallica kicks in on track one, Brandenburg Gate, including the vocal ... I was taken away, and stayed there the whole cd.    Maybe it's because, although a huge music fan, I haven't focused much on Reed or Metallica ... and wasn't pigeonholed.  I somehow needed this record, and I wasn't disappointed.  I don't know why Brandenburg Gate got trashed in here, that track blows me away ... and I also love Iced Honey ... the rest of the cd works, too.  Just being honest, I figured Lou Reed with Metallica would be a new species ... it is and it kicks ass.

I personally don't care what his political leanings are, I wanted a good read and I got an excellent read! Only complaint is it wasn't long enough!   Those low mark reviews are simply due to the price, and if you can't give a review of something you've actually read, why waste your time?
0307593312|3.0|As has been said over and over, it is `mesmerizing and ambitious':  I continued to flip through the pages and mostly enjoy the experience, and, ambitiously, it references a lot of great music, food, and some literature.  But ambition does not equal success, and by the end, it just doesn't seem to add up to much more than the author toying with his ability to get us to read a whole lot of pages.  Once I was on to this game, it starts to feel like the last 300 pages could have been edited down to a couple chapters, and by the time the flat ending rolled around my patience with Murakami had run out.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I've read all year, bar none. It looked good, I had heard it was good, but I was not prepared for just how amazingly well written and gripping a story it would be. This is the sort of book you look for when none of your favorite authors have kept up with your reading schedule. Fair to middling books are what you usually end up with in vain searches for other good authors and you put up with iffy plots, poorly developed characters, poor descriptions and unbelievable dialogue. None of that is true with Hunger Games.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has created a very believable post-apocalyptic world for her characters. We don't know what brought an end to the United States and you won't find yourself wondering about it for long as you are sucked into the world that does exist, and the characters who inhabit it. As a bonus, you finally find out how enjoyable it is to read a properly formatted Kindle book, an extreme rarity in itself. Hunger Games has none of the typos and misspellings plaguing most Kindle books. It was a combination that made it all but impossible to put this book down.<br /><br />The story takes place sometime in the future, far enough from our own time that though most of the old United States seem to lie in ruins, the people enjoy a level of technological advancement we can only imagine. The Old United States is now 12 areas subject to the Capitol, which is located somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. These areas are separate from each other, isolated by barbed wire, electric fences, brutal security forces and distance. Each is dedicated to the production of something useful to the capitol. In the case of District 12, where the heroine - sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen - hails from, this product is coal.<br /><br />After an unsuccessful rebellion, District 13 was destroyed and the other twelve were forced to participate in punitive \\"Hunger Games\\" - sending tribute in the form once sent to King Minos - humans, a male and a female from each district, forced to compete in violent games from which only one survivor emerges. Katniss is one of those chosen, and this is her story, told first person - entirely through her eyes alone - in a very compelling narrative. You can empathize with Katniss, her life, her motions, her thought processes - why she makes the decisions she makes. She is a reluctant hero, but her reticence is believable, not frustrating, as in so many other fantasy novels featuring teenage protagonists (Robert Jordan comes to mind).<br /><br />Read this book!

0312263511|3.0|It's not the worst autobiography among the astronauts and does give more insight than most into the behind the scenes politics among the astronaut corps. I have to agree that a lot of time is spent on a variety of topics far less interesting or momentous than the Apollo 17 mission and that is very disappointing. However, the insights into the Project Gemini missions is among the best IMHO and really helped me see some of the issues that were glossed over by many other writers in a clearer light. The other autobiography that also shown a serious light on those issues is Mike Collins' \\"Carrying the Fire\\". As for others comments about Ego - excuse me - ah fighter pilot turned astronaut - reality check please! All in all, a descent read with some unlikely insights but not what I expected with regard to the main issue in the title - the Apollo 17 mission.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I am 71 pages in but wanted to write a review now because something is on my mind!  Someone, please, help me get over it...  This review doesn't contain any spoilers (well, not that you wouldn't have already deduced from the title of the book anyway, and certainly none beyond page 71) but I was hoping to start a debate about the book and on the wider theme of time travel.  I am a huge fan of Stephen King's work and attach no caveat to that statement. He is an amazing writer and if some of his books have been a bit hit-and-miss, he is still well within any tolerance levels of mine.  With vampires visited in Salem's Lot, the Frankenstein parallels of Pet Semetary and the ultimate haunted house in The Shining, it's fair to say that with Stephen King's work we get to see great re-branding of long held human fears.  The last book of his I read was The Dome, which sees a step in the direction of science fiction but maintained the human relationship stories he tells so well most of the time.  Like I said, I'm 71 pages into 11.22.63. Already, I see similarities to The Dome. The difference for me in the two is that with The Dome as a story, there's no need to rationalise anything once you agree to the premise - there's a big dome over a town and no-one can get in an out, so that's that, let the characters get on with it. It's King's story so it's his rules.  However, with 11.22.63, I don't think the 'his story, his rules' can apply as easily... which I feel very silly saying, given that time travel has no hard and fast rules (yet). Already I have picked up on a couple of things which I think will irritate me as I make my way through the novel.  I have accepted the premise that it's a novel about time travel, so I have happily accepted the time portal being at the end of a mobile diner with a bad reputation stemming from its cheap meat.  That's fine by me - I wouldn't read time travel novels if I was only going to struggle with accepting that you need something - a portal, avehicle, a time machine, a black hole, whatever - in which to make the time travel happen. But from what I've read so far, the... I hate to say this because I'd probably rip it apart if someone else said it... the SCIENCE is wrong!!!  Anyone else who has made it to the part I'm at, what do you think about the tree being across the road, the flat tyres, the broken bridge? To my mind, that's suggesting an order is in place which doesn't want to be messed with, which is a contradiction in terms because the same conscious order is a self-fulfilling prophecy... I'm losing myself here but do you get what I mean? And when Jake Epping narrates something like 'I have a feeling Texas is going to be tough!' after the penny has dropped with him, I just thought 'Oh, here we go...' and found myself wondering if it was just going to be one set piece after another with the universe throwing up various obstacles to overcome. I am, in face, still wondering it.  Another thing which troubled me... another contradiction.  If you re-set the past to its original path every time you re-visit it, why would you have to wait so long to whack Oswald? I won't give away too much in case you haven't read it, but if you imagine a Ground Hog Day where you can go on for as long as you like and then re-set it then you're not far off what I'm getting at. Just find Oswald (if that's your thing) and whack him!  I hope I haven't come across as negative, because so far the book is great - well written, and a laugh out loud moment when Jake asks about going back in time to kill your own grandfather ('Why the f*** would you want to do that?' is the answer, which is such a good question to respond with and although it doesn't solve the paradox, it does give it a much-needed sense of perspective!). I just often think about time travel and hope this review could lead to a debate about it and hopefully someone can convince me to think a bit differently by challenging my ideas on it.  Should you get the book? Ofcourse you should - it's by Stephen King and it's on time travel. Enough said.   And I'll leave you with this: If you want to read a TERRIFYING book, try [[ASIN:1453867503 Thirteen]] Thirteen Volume One. You can thank me later...
B004KAB3ZM|5.0|It's amazing that Mike Collins wrote this book in the early 1970s and it still sets the standard, IMHO, for astronaut autobiographies.  I read it decades ago and just returned to it recently.  I kept reading other astronaut autobiographies, often co-authored by professional writers, and saying to myself - 'It's just not as clear and detailed as Collins' book!'.  Then I started to wonder if I had lionized the book in my memory and could it be as good as I recalled? So, I reread it recently and I found that it's still one of the best, if not the single best, astronaut biographies.  One of the amazing things about this book is the sense the reader gets of Mike Collins truly believing that he got where he was through a combination of very hard work and luck.  This sort of humility is hard to come by in any group of pilots, let alone fighter pilots or <Gasp!> test pilots, let alone astronauts.  I also find it a bit disappointing, as at least one other reviewer noted, that it was written in the early 70s and has not been meaningfully updated.  I, for one, would welcome his thoughts on his tenure at the Smithsonian (among other experiences).  Due to his attitude about autographs, his is one of the few astronaut autobiographies I own that is not autographed by the author.

0452289963|5.0|I have read this book twice and plan to read it again. In the meantime I flip it open to any page when I am feeling angry, frustrated, depressed etc. or even when I am just looking for a little lift. There is something so clear and true about Tolle's writing. I also have the book on cd and listen to it at night as I am getting ready to sleep. He puts everything in perspective and gives you the insight to truly enjoy every minute of your life. I think that when you get right down to it, this is what everybody is really looking for. I have read many books about meditation/Buddhism and besides Jon Kabat-Zinn, Eckhart Tolle is the only person who ever captured my interest and seemed to be saying something.....new?

How would he defend himself if someone raised such issues? Being mercurial is just not enough? Did he just get it or did he spend hours analyzing things?  - What would he think before, while negotiating deals? Any negotiation tips?  The list goes on ....  Walter is not a business guy. And it shows. The jornalistic description of his life is not enough for such a great character. I do give credit for all the research and interviews and lots of stories. But alas ... Thats all you get.. Stories. And emotions.
0380799006|5.0|This is such an insightful book on how to raise children who will eventually get along. I'm one of five children and I think my mom did an amazing job raising us in part because we're all such close friends still.  But now that I'm a mom I see it's so hard to figure out how to teach children to get along. Reading this book, I could see so many recommendations for things that I now realize my mom did. And the best part is it's written in an easy-to-understand manner for busy moms!
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|the story, acting, directing, production etc were all first rate, id expect nothing less from the team responsible for BE. The area where this fell down was in the script. Although weve had other shows that moved at a slow pace, this just seemed to drag and drag. The only thing i can come up with is there is no humour in this show; its just dour...  Sopranos, Rome and even The Wire had great humour that just seemed to complement the drama.  Im aware that some of the writers for BE also worked on the sopranos, but i feel theyve missed a beat here. in this regard, BE has more similarities to Brotherhood than other great HBO shows. Watchable but not up to previous standards...
0679411585|3.0|I couldn't put it down and read it over just a few days.  Very entertaining, especially if you are keen on all the details about a four day span when the two battles took place.    The only thing that bothered me is that the book celebrates Lt.Col. Moore (the author) as a hero and Lt.Col. McDade is heavily criticized for his actions. The number of casualties from each battle were similar -- more KIAs at LZ Albany, but not dramatically more. Each lost life is a tragedy, but how much worse of a job did McDade do than Moore?  McDade certainly had a less defined mission to work with than Moore, and more difficult or uncertain terrain. McDade may have made some serious blunders, but it would have been nice to have his perspective on his decisions. Regarding Moore's decisions/actions, even the \\"Lost Platoon\\" getting separated from the rest of the battalion is excused at the outset by putting the blame on an overzealous lieutenant.    In spite of needing a little bit more balance in comparing the two leaders, I would highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys a detailed war history.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|This film was excellent. It's about a sleazy cable channel owner named Max Renn who is looking for a new show that's more intense than the usual lineup of softcore porn. He stumbles on Videodrome, a show depicting torture and murder apparently broadcasted from Malaysia. As Max watches, he begins to experience hallucinations that become more and more frequent. His hallucinations eventually begin to transform his body, and he peels back the mystery of what Videodrome actually is.   This is a great film. I loved it, and I'm a general fan of the Criterion Collection's library of films. This is no exception. It has a beautifully designed case, and essays, and pleant of extras, as you would expect from a Criterion release. The picture quality is also good.  Overall, I'd say that the Criterion version of the film is worth it. Thanks for reading.
B004FECNIO|5.0|\\"AI\\" takes place in a time after all the glaciers have melted and the coastal cities are underwater. The film poses many questions, but primarily focuses on the human urge to create, nurture and abandon on both personal and macro levels. The more I think about it - and it's occupying a lot of my mind time today - the more I realize how ambitious, profound and prescient this movie is. It questions, on the most fundamental levels, our relationship with our own creations -- living and artificial offspring, as well as society itself -- and wonders where we draw various lines and how they are determined, and are we even equipped to make those decisions, considering we are emotional and capricious and selfish and mortal. Whew. Way too much. And the conclusion drawn by the filmmakers will be taken differently by many different viewers, but, to me, it shows that when faced with the starkest truths of permanence, we are not only willing to settle for illusion but will chase it as far as our imaginations will allow.   Other notes: Jude Law in a turn that creates one of the great tragic characters of film history ... the Blu-Ray version is stunning visually and aurally and every movie shown in the home with good equipment should be in this format; nothing else comes close.

B0056DHCYS|4.0|This new Frankfurt Opera recording of Korngold's iconic 1920 masterpiece Die Todt Stadt is well performed and recorded with a new sonic clarity and some lovely emotion brought to the fore front. Musically, this has - for me - always been one of the early 20th century's operatic masterworks. Korngold, who became well known and well paid as a film composer (especially from the studios and producers of most Erroll Flynn swash-bucklers) was first and best a symphony and opera composer. In particular, his Violin Concerto and the operas; particularly Die Todt Stadt and Violanta are rich, melodic and dramatically satisfying and deserve to be played more often.  The story of \\"The Dead City\\" is taken from the novel \\"The Dead Bruges\\" by Flemish writer Georges Rodenbach. The main character, Paul, obsesses over death and for much of the opera he broods over his wife's death, thinking that he had killed her. The libretto flirts with reality and with dreams, as does the novel until Paul & his wife Marietta are reunited in the afterlife in a sad, but beautiful conclusion. Musically, this is a very fine performance. Conductor Sebastien Weigle has a clear feel for the work and the forces of the Frankfurt Opera play with distinction. The performances by Klaus Florian Vogt as Paul and Tatiana Pavlovskaya as Marietta are very good as are the supporting roles (especially Michael Nagy as Frank, Paul's friend)  I confess, however, that I am so used to the powerful first recording with Leinsdorf and Rene Kollo as Paul and Carol Neblett as Marietta, that I had to get used to the very different timbre of Klaus Vogt's voice and his softer, more vulnerable, interpretation. (Kollo had a much more cutting tenor - practically a heldentenor - and the role was more stoic as well)  Vogt brings a sensitivity to his portrayal of Paul's sad reality that cannot be ignored, though. Another aspect of this Frankfurt performance that must be inferred by reading the booklet is the staging by Anselm Weber who gives the players a costumery and makeup that evokes the Mexican \\"Dia de los Muertos\\" in its symbology.  Die Todt Stadt contains a great deal of truly great music. Interestingly, the one big set piece that most people will recognize is \\"Gluck, das mir verblieb\\" (My happiness that remained), the love duet between Paul & Marietta that actually surfaces just before the closing of the first act and is quoted again, briefly, near the end of the opera.  It remains one of Korngold's most poignant melodies and - in some ways - this payoff comes too early. Another good reason to get this new recording, though, is to become familiar with the new Frankfurt Opera series of mostly modern works on the Oehms Classics label. This series in addition to this Todt Stadt and a Rheingold includes two works by German Aribert Reimann (including his excellent Lear) as well as new works  by Detlev Glanert and Franco Leoni. (Were I in Frankfurt, I would definitely be there!) This seems like an excellent series and this very nice and slightly different Todt Stadt is a very good place to start!gives the players a costumery and makeup that evokes the Mexican \\"Dia de los Muertos\\" in its symbology.

1451627289|4.0|King is a master of horror and I have long been a fan.  This book is not of that genre but more sci-fi.  The only thing you are asked to believe is time travel - a minor request from Mr. King.  11/22/63 had me in the 50's all weekend and it was time well-spent.  This is the first review I have written despite being a voracious reader.  This book proves that King can put you under his spell with or without horror; he's just a damned good writer and knows how to spin a tale.  Hope you are working on your next book, Mr. King!  I can't wait.

B005M4EM5S|5.0|I don't know where to begin. I don't think I can write a review worthy of this book, either. First I should mention that I have read all of Sanderson's novels thus far, excluding the final Wheel of Time book. After I read the final Mistborn book I mentally sat in the corner and cried for a week or so, but I think that's what I seek most in Fantasy. I think my favorite thing about Sanderson's writing is how he leaps around from character to character flawlessly. At first I was a little overwhelmed by all the jumping around, but I think that that only makes it stronger. I settled into it quickly enough, and started really enjoying all the different settings that Sanderson has created. Way of Kings, like all Sanderson's other novels, is layer upon layer, and the unwrapping in the tale is believable but still titillating. Obviously I'm struggling to write this but I don't know how to express how much I loved this book. I desperately want to know more about Dalinar and his past. I want to learn about Szeth's and Kaldin's powers. And I desperately want to unravel the truth behind the desolation and the High-storms. The only negative to this book, I think, is the character Shallan, but I think that that is because I don't like the type of person she represents. I am still giving this book five stars because Shallan is tolerable and Sanderson more than makes up for her with the other fantastic characters. I love this book, I know others may not, but I think it is wonderful and I anxiously await its successors.  Now to talk about my problem with Shallan. In general, I think she is sort of annoying. She has this sort of subtle little-miss-perfect attitude that I can't stand. It's not that I didn't find myself rooting for her, it's just that sometimes I had to roll my eyes. I think maybe the problem here is that Sanderson has more trouble writing from the viewpoint of a teenage girl, though maybe not because I loved Vin in Mistborn. I guess that maybe Shallan's attitude corresponds to that of a lesser noble-type, but that doesn't make her any less annoying. I hope that she will change a little in the books to come. I did like the plot line surrounding her, though, and I like Jasnah quite a bit. But I do have to rant about one more thing. The concept of her memory snap-shots made me want to hit my head against a wall. I am an artist and as one I can say with certainty that that is not the way it works. I understand it's fantasy, but the concept of totally photographic memory is complete bs, and I wished Sanderson could have avoided that. But I guess it was rectified with some of her other abilities as a soul-caster. But seriously, no one can look at something and memorize the image totally. That is stupid beyond belief. Anyway, that is my rant. I give this five stars anyway because everything else is amazingly well-written. I loved it!

B005CA4SJW|2.0|I do NOT recommend this product to ANYONE.<br />While \\"The Walking Dead\\" is a first-class show, this \\"Special\\" edition package isn't worth the pressing. $25 is what you'd expect to pay for a COMPLETE television series' season...not a 6-episode, teaser season.<br />Having not known how short the season was, to say I disappointed at my purchase is a magnificent understatement. Besides the scant number of episodes, the \\"bonus features\\" are sorely lacking, not even warranting the 3rd disc at all (final 2 episodes on 2nd disc, then a black & white version of the pilot and a featurette on the 3rd)...that was a purely marketability ploy.<br />Having only seen the latest season since returning from a year-long military deployment to Afghanistan, I was very anxious to catch up with this acclaimed zombie series. Unfortunately, the high-cost/low-return investment on this scam makes it a \\"Must NOT See!\\" Do yourself a favor and buy the digits from Amazon for $9.99

B00000DSHO|5.0|Master Sound  EK 52856 Long box. I have several CD versions of this Boston album. I like the Master Sound the most. Now, the DR database lists this as an overall Dynamic Range of 10. The DSD download is listed as 11. I think there where some reviews of the SACD that came out, and it wasn't all together outstanding. Therefore, if your going to go for a 16/44 Red Book version, you cant go wrong with the Master Sound version. The MS version requires some volume cranking, where it really blooms; like most good engineered albums with decent dynamics. A great vinyl of this may have the best fidelity, and if I had the analog equipment, I would go that route on this one. If your just not satisfied with the DSD SACD or download, then this Master Sound is the way to go. Besides, these MS long boxes are getting to be nice collectibles. ( The Roger Waters MS is so good, I elected not even to buy the new SACD version of Amused to death.)

B005D51JQQ|3.0|Concert tickets have been a rip off for years, I stopped going to shows after The Eagles successfully tested the $87 ticket prices.  I paid once and only once to see them at Gund Arena for $87 and after going to over 150 shows during that 15 year period, i was done.  I am amazed the people who have been feeding the SUPER HIGH touring machines like U2, The Stones, now Sting I hear, etc.  But now why these kind of prices for CD's?  This is no collectable, these are songs already released on other albums.  $100 extra bucks for a pretty box and a nice booklet? Now way this is worth it and it's just stupid!  I give the music and the packaging 5 stars, but the value 0 stars thus making my 3 star review!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I don't think you can be a reader and not have heard of the books by this author.  Every discussion board on Amazon was busy with posts when the most recent novel in the series came out.  It isn't my normal genre, but there was enough buzz that I decided to give it a go to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />There has been so much written that I won't go into plot or storyline but I will say I enjoyed it very much.  I had actually put in on my book group's reading list and am looking forward to discussing it this week.  It is massive (800+ pages), complicated, and slow reading but I found myself eager to get back to it each time.  Knights, kings, wars and mythical creatures - lots of drama and intrigue as well as some blood and guts.  Three major storylines that interweave but don't resolve.  I liked it well enough to put the second one on my Christmas wish list.<br /><br />One side note:  I originally tried to read this on my Kindle, but gave up after the first 80 pages and bought a paper copy.  I have never done this before, but there were too many characters for me to keep track of without constantly going back and referencing the appendix.  Going back and forth so much was very frustrating.  With the paper copy, it was much easier.

0545323126|5.0|This is what my grandson wants for Christmas, that is why I bought these  books.  He will enjoy reading them.
0486406482|4.0|When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece.  I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read.  As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and one can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease.  It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.<br /><br />Volume one makes for a very interesting read, as we're already introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, within only a few chapters in. We see that Emma's designs to interfere in Harriet's relationships is centred on her presumption that it was she who matchmade Miss Taylor's matrimony to Mr Weston.  Emma wants to matchmake Harriet with Mr Elton, not Mr Martin, of Harriet's own choice. She tries to put Harriet off Mr Martin by calling him 'a gross, and vulgar farmer.' Her input breaks up Harriet's relationship with Mr Martin, and we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but not with Emma.  Our opinion of her schemes makes readers feel critical of Emma for interfering.<br /><br />In volume two, we continue to be critical of Emma.  On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one.  It gets particularly tedious when Austen devotes pages of the novel to Miss Bate's blabbing on and on.  The themes eventually begin to link in volume three. We get a better understanding of volume two, and we can see there is something more conclusive.  We continue to feel cold towards Emma throughout volume two, including because of her prejudices towards Miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.  Emma forms false assumptions about Jane Fairfax, when she assumes there is more to her relationship with Mr Dixon than meets the eye.  Mr Dixon is married to Miss Campbell, who is Jane's best friend. Jane would never do that to Miss Campbell, and Emma's presumptions are wrong.  We don't like Emma, she misleads us.<br /><br />By volume three, our understanding of Emma gradually grows warmer.  Her feelings  begin to change.  She begins to realize the truth. Her understanding of Mr Frank Chruchill, and Mr George Knightley begins to change.  She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men.  By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax.  We are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father, is against this union of the two, believing that Emma has vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after him, and not leave.<br /><br />Sometimes in Austen, it seems like if the story had continued into another volume, things might not have been happily ever after between Emma and George Knighley afterall, or between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill.  Divorce might have been a theme that could have gone on in Emma, if the plot had extended into a volume four, because I was quite convinced that Frank Churchill had intimate feelings for Emma.  In the same way I felt Knightley felt for Fairfax.  However, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, we shall never know.<br /><br />Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes of volume three.
0553801473|3.0|I agree with all the comments below that expressed disappointment in this book.  With winter coming, most readers of this series are ready to settle some scores and see the Starks returned to Winterfell.  Instead, this book mostly slow-steps and drags the plot out unnecessary (with a few notable and exciting twists and exceptions).  Also absent from this book are several key viewpoint characters.  The book seems to be making a hard pivot towards the end, however, which will hopefully catapult into the next book.  There is as much drama here with what is unwritten as with what is told.<br /><br />I only started this series this summer and quickly got up to speed.  I can only imagine how disappointing this whole turn of events is to long-time readers who have been waiting to avenge Ned Stark's death for 15 years.  Sorry folks, no satisfaction here.<br /><br />Of course, this is part of the mastery of George R.R. Martin.  He keeps you on the edge of your seat, pulls you in, and feeds you just enough to hope between helpings of disappointment and injustice to keep you reading.<br /><br />I only hope there will be some satisfaction in the end, whenever that may be...
B005VGYA68|5.0|\\"Here comes the sun....the smile's returning to their faces.\\" -- George Harrison, 1969<br /><br />\\"I want to tell you, my head is filled with things to say.\\" -- George Harrison, 1966<br /><br />This is the documentary Beatle fans and George Harrison fans have prayed for and long awaited! As others have noted, I, too could have happily watched both installments at one time. Seeing it broken into 2 separate parts had an advantage in that it gave me something to look forward to wataching. This is a brilliant work covering the life and artwork of George Harrison, artist extraordinaire in his multi-faceted glory.<br /><br />I've said all along that George was all about love. From the time George made his presence known and felt; from the time he was placed in the loving arms of Louise French Harrison and she saw her own intensity looking back at her; from the time Harold Sr. first set eyes on George and his only sister and two older brothers welcomed this \\"new little Harrison,\\" as Louise French Harrison would later describe George and other new arrivals (nieces, nephews and grandchildren) with much love. Harold Sr. and Louise French were from all accounts a very loving couple who were nuturing to their 4 children. George, surrounded by love from the beginning would live full circle by making a final request that people \\"love one another.\\"<br /><br />This documentary portrays the REAL George Harrison and does not degenerate into idolatry. George is shown in many moods, some less than cheery and shown warts, wrinkles, atrocious perm days and all.<br /><br />George's fellow Wilburys and former Beatle bandmate Paul McCartney and wife Olivia provide the best interviews. I just wish more Harrison family members had been a part of this stellar documentary. George's sister, also named Louise has banged on the drum for her brother for many years. In fact, George was the first Beatle to cross the Atlantic, coming to America in 1963 to visit his only sister.<br /><br />Most, if not all Harrison fans find George's view of religions very interesting. It has been documented that Louise French Harrison, herself Catholic had George baptized in March of 1943 when he was 1 month old. In 1965 George and Ravi Shankar met and during that time, George introduced the world at large to Eastern music and was exploring his philosophies and religious expression. His Catholic roots never left him; a lovely statue of Mother Mary graced his property at Friar Park.<br /><br />Louise, George's only sister would say in an early April 2011 interview that it was a shock to her to discover that the \\"real world\\" wasn't as honest as Harold Sr. and Louise French were and not everybody lived up to their high standard of honesty. George too lived by that credo and he took things to heart deeply and passionately.<br /><br />George was also fun. He liked cool cars and was an avid Formula One Fan. His sister had a serious Dodge Dart when he first came to visit her in 1963 when she was living in Benton, Illinois. He had a brilliant, dry, droll wit. He loved nature and demonstrated a very nurturing side, which was a Louise French trait. His passion for gardening was a gift from Harold Sr. and Louise French. George was an intensely curious and interested person, seeking information and trying to make sense out of the world in which he lived.<br /><br />George had beautiful wavy hair, courtesy of Harold Sr.; the deep-set Harold Sr. eyes, but he had the burning Louise intensity that never once left his eyes. Pictures of George as an infant and as a very young child show his ubiquitous intensity, which never left him at any time. It could be a tad unnerving to see such intensity radiating from one so young. It was a trait that never left him. George resembled Harold Sr. from the eyes up. From the nose down, he was Louise French Harrison all over again and his brother Peter was almost a double of Harold Sr.! Harold Jr. looked more French than Harrison; he and George inherited theirmaternal grandfather's tall, lean frame. Lou was a Franco-Harrison creation as was George. You get to appreciate these things all the more in the book AND in the documentary. Paul McCartney even says in the book that George had a lot of Louise French's character and personality in him. Louise definitely left her stamp on George! Louise even said in the newsletter that she always thought George looked like her dad, John French Sr.)<br /><br />Louise French Harrison lent her voice to the George Harrison Official Fan Club Newsletter from 1965-1969. It is plain that Louise loved George and his siblings and in her column, each Harrison child is included and given his or her place under Here Comes the Sun.<br /><br />Olivia is a beautiful gracious lady and she discusses her life with George and some of the road bumps they hit along the way. She does so with grace, tact and aplomb. At no time does she resort to tawdry tale-bearing and finger pointing. Despite all they had been through together, they raised a good son and Olivia loved George, warts, problems, atrocious perms, infidelity and all. Dhani, their son resembles George and his maternal grandmother who unfortunately died 8 years before he was born. Clearly George and Olivia loved and cared about each other and again, to Olivia's credit, she is tactful and discreet when certain questions crop up. That reflects well on her and speaks to good.<br /><br />Readers walk the Long & Winding Road with George from his early days until his untimely death in 2001. I love the way George could see humor in himself AND his fellow Beatles, as evidenced in his laughing at a Beatle video. The interviews make a good thing even better and I thank the kind person who made it possible for me to watch this until I am able to buy this dvd.<br /><br />George Harrison has given the gift of his beautiful voice to many. I knew a child with Asperger's Syndrome, which is a form of autism. She was a MAJOR Beatles fan and George was her favorite. This child, like so many children with autism spectrum issues was a late talker. Once she acquired speech and an awareness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles. She would let George \\"talk\\" for her in that she would quote Harrison lyrics and lyrics from Beatle songs to get a point/message across. This later segued into richer, developed speech. As I said about the book, George Harrison's music and his natural, yet childlike grace of sorts reached countless many. He has a large following of fans with autism, as do the Beatles as a group. Beatle fans with autism is a demographic that is not at all rare or unusual.<br /><br />George's humor comes through time and again. His sardonic wit after that crackpot broke into his home at the tail end of 1999 was evidenced when he said in re the crackpot: \\"well, he sure wasn't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys.\\" He had made peace with his life; he was surrounded by love every step of the way. George during his post-1999 brush with death had a very peaceful and serene look about him; his eyes, always intense like those of Louise French Harrison included an inner peace, like his 1968 song \\"The Inner Light.\\" He disclosed his peace and the fact that he was ready to let go to Olivia, who bore this with dignity and grace.<br /><br />A beautiful tribute to George and how meaningful his life has been in the eyes of those who knew him and others who love his art/music. George has brought more people closer to God. In fact, my church, which is a Catholic church uses George songs, some of which like \\"Dear One\\" are beautiful prayers set to music for our prayer meetings, Bible studes and discussion groups. George is, as we say \\"a parishioner by proxy\\" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.<br /><br />Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.<br /><br />You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.ness of music, she found her voice in the Beatles.

George is, as we say \\"a parishioner by proxy\\" because his beautiful music and his open heart and mind have set a good example to countless people.   Bless George, George's family and all who have traveled down the Long & Winding Road with George.  You will also want to read [[ASIN:1889899054 Before He Was Fab : George Harrison's First American Visit]], which was co-authored by George's sister, Louise.
B00540G3G6|5.0|I love this movie. On bluray its something magical. You can see details, textures and shading that you never noticed, even in the theater. It really has never looked this good. The sound likewise is excellent. The biggest disagreement in my house about it is whether its a christmas or halloween movie.<br /><br />If youre thinking of getting this you probably already know how amazing the story is, if you havent seen it, rent it first cause the story isnt for everyone and is perhaps a little too dark for younger viewers.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie with a good cast of veteran actors Eddie Murphy (as an expressive thief), Ben Stiller (as manager of a fancy schmansy hotel), Alan Alda (rich investor), Matthew Broderick (Wall Street has-been), Tea Leoni (FBI Agent with a heart), and other characters.  It was a great mix of comedy and adventure.<br /><br />Alan Alda is filthy rich, living in the penthouse of The Tower in New York, where the average condo goes for $5.6 million.  The hotel is staffed with service 24/7, who cater to the rich.  Alda schmoozes everbody, right out of their life savings and pensions.  After the FBI shows up to arrest Alda, Stiller gets together a group to try and steal everyone's money back, knowing that these type guys always keep a substantial cash stash hidden in case they have to get outta Dodge quickly.<br /><br />There is some cool stunt work and some colorful characters.  Because of the references to stealing and the language and sexual innuendos (although limited), I do not recommend this movie for your young children.<br /><br />Not an award winner, but good solid entertainment.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I just purchased Harry Potter 7 Part 2 with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy. My god what a nightmare to get these activated. To view the digital movie you need to create accounts at Flixster and ultraviolet and link them. Then you have to download the ap to view it on your device. What a nightmare I cant get my accounts to sync so I cant access the movie. After searching through both sites and trying on firefox, chrome and IE I give up. I paid extra for the digital copy for my kids to watch them on their ipods. Never again......<br /><br />If you can ever get them linked be aware that you don't actually download the movie. You have to stream them over your network to your device.

B0021AEIUU|5.0|This is one of my favourite books of one of my favourite authors.  This review, however, is about the kindle version of the book and not so much the book.  I have and can wrote pages about the actual book content.  As for the kindle version, it's fine.  I had highlighted and marked up a paper-based version and as part of a long process of a couple of books had put the highlights and comments on ebook version.  PDFs work well but the kindle version works just as well too.
0385534639|4.0|Erin Morgenstern uses the setting of a magical circus as a place to unveil many components of human relationships that bring illumination to the best and the worst of human behavior. The Night Circus caught my attention from the outset and maintained my engagement throughout. As the complexity of the plot and the development of characters progressed, I gained increased respect for Morgenstern's skills. The circus becomes the locus of a contest between magicians. Thanks to her writing skills, it became much more than a competition, and the repercussions of what was set in motion became significant. This is a novel that most readers will want to discuss with others.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|The first half of this book was compelling, interesting and thoughtful.  Then, it morphed into something less interesting - a 'biography' not of Jobs, but of Apple Computer. The author lost sight of the subject of this biography, and instead just recites the general facts that are well know about Apple - particularly from when Jobs was 'fired' by the company, founded NeXT, and returned.  Overall, the book is an easy read and worth the effort. I had hoped for more detail and insight from people mentioned. We all know that Steve could be cruel, erratic etc - but no one really is able to answer 'why'. This book is more about the 'what' and the 'how' of Steve Jobs.   An appealing feature is that it's not an entirely flattering portrait of Jobs, and very critical comments about him are not glossed over or 'explained' - as a more conventional 'authorised' biography would usually do.
0307887898|5.0|My business partners and I are starting a business from scratch, and I am always promoting the \\"gospel\\" of starting your own business as a way to greater autonomy, satisfaction, and (if done right) financial returns. One of the main problems with starting a business is the financial and time capital that is often required, that keeps owning a business out of the reach of most people. Also, once business owners get locked into a particular way of doing things, under the traditional system, necessary change can be cumbersome and complicated. In this economic environment, most start-ups will, by necessity, be \\"lean,\\" and therefore benefit from the advice in this book. So, if you don't have a lot of money to invest, but have a great idea and/or product, this book is for you.<br /><br />This is an interesting book filled with entertaining stories that explain the author's successes and failures. Written by the co-founder of IMVU, this book encourages business owners to get a minimum viable product out quickly and then work from there. By constantly analyzing various metrics and customer feedback, a business can quickly alter its products and direction (\\"pivot\\") if need be. In my business, we have found that pivoting, based on feedback, is a valuable tool. We have had to tweak various aspects of our business as we have seen what customers want, what they are searching for on Google, etc.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent and helpful book. While not every business will benefit from his advice, and certainly the old way of doing things works too (if you have the time and money), the advice contained in this book is useful for any start-up that can't afford to do things the \\"traditional\\" and bulky way.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|This app downloaded just as it should have.  I took the necessary actions on my Micro Cruz and when the download was complete the Cruz asked if I wanted the app installed. I answered in the affirmative and watched as the device installed it and announced it had been installed.  However, it is nowhere on my device.  The problem may be in the device but it also may be in the app itself.

B002N1AEN2|5.0|The lyrics are quite mediocre and the subject matter is similiar throughout, however the sound meshes really well with the vocals. I played this C.D. to close-to-death when I first got it and it's been well worth every dime(I bought locally). I'm no audiophile, nor an expert on music but I had to adjust my now aging stereo( they don't make them, like the used too ehm iSoundGarbage) to get the best sound for them. All, in all well worth the listen and it's a great choice for the more often than chill moods ;).
B0001ARCFA|2.0|I would have rated these as a 4 or 5 until they broke. It turns out the speaker assemblies are held to the headband by a single tiny screw and a low-grade plastic cap. Seriously AKG?  They're still under warranty, but what a disappointment.<br /><br />Otherwise, they are very comfortable; I could wear these for hours & hours. The tradeoff is that they are a little loose - I had trouble keeping them in place when playing drums, but great for sitting in front of a computer.<br /><br />I replaced the AKGs with some Audio-Technicas which are louder, still quite comfy and seem to be of much more substantial construction.<br /><br />Update: Attempting to get service with AKG/Harmon under warranty. No response to email for one week.

1451637500|5.0|This is a great book. I loved the fact the story was told from different points of view. A lot of funny moments. I sort of expected the event that happened at the end of the book.

6300246876|5.0|Tora! Tora! Tora!, 1970 film   This videotape starts with a trailer that advertised this product. &#34;The most spectacular film ever made!&#34; The movie starts with a view of a Japanese aircraft carrier. Admiral Yamamoto is now in charge of this ship. [He opposed the politics of the Army.] The Army wants an alliance with Germany. The US opposes their war on China. The British, French, and Dutch removed soldiers from their colonial possessions and weakened their military forces in Asia. The US moved its fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. The Japanese diplomat brings a list of questions for the US government. The US government has a decoding machine to read the Japanese messages. The Japanese plan to destroy the US fleet for a quick victory. [No Plan B?] Commander Genda created a plan of attack. Their Type 21 Zero fighter is better than the Spitfire or Messerschmidt. The US Air Corps General doesn't want the airplanes spread out since that makes sabotage easier. Will the US Navy rotate its carriers so they're not all in port?   Combat aircraft are flying artillery that can attack at long range. &#34;Genda has thought of everything.&#34; The US has also surmised their plan, will they guard against this? But they don't have the B-17s needed for long-range observation. The new radar can check for airplanes. Yamamoto says a victory in the Pacific will not end the war. The President is removed from the Ultra list! The US military is warned to take &#34;precautionary measures&#34;. General Short orders a &#34;Full Alert&#34;. Grouping aircraft makes them vulnerable to an attack. Japanese airplanes practice their tactics against an island. The US radar station is now located on a mountain top, but has no telephone line. The Japanese send a new Ambassador to the US; he signed the Pact with Germany. Colonel Bratton surmises a significance in a specific date. A British report tells of Japanese transports off of Formosa. He predicts an attack on Sunday, November 30 from these undeniable facts. &#34;The US desires Japanesean to commit the first overt act.&#34; But keep on the alert. Navy fighters are sent to Midway and Wake. Airplanes will patrol the search from carriers. The Japanese Embassy in Washington will get a 14-part message. [The Japanese attack fleet approached from the North outside of the usual shipping lanes.] The decoded 13-part message is given to the White House Sat. evening when people are busy.   Boeing B-17s are expected to arrive at 7:30 am on Sunday. The Japanese reply must be given to America at 1pm Washington time. The Japanese coding machines, cipher books, and secret papers must be destroyed immediately! Sunday is a day of rest, everything is closed down. The Japanese aircraft take off in the dark. General Marshall orders an alert to the Pacific commands. A Navy destroyer sees a submarine trying to sneak into Pearl Harbor and attacks it. Will all commanders be warned? The Honolulu radio is a beacon. The Army radar station gets a warning. &#34;Don't worry about it.&#34; The warning from Washington is sent by commercial telegram. The Japanese aircraft sight their targets, who are unprepared for defense at 8am. &#34;This is no drill!&#34; The US aircraft grouped together are a target. That flight of B-17s scatters to other airfields. Japanese airplanes drop bombs and torpedoes. The USS Arizona and other warships suffer serious damage.   &#34;Its Pearl&#34; says the Secretary of War; it is confirmed. P-40s take off from other fields to attack the enemy. One ship is beached to prevent blocking of the south channel. More US aircraft are attacked on the ground. One damaged Japanese airplane crashes into a hangar. The Japanese diplomats deliver their message after the attack. The Japanese Navy does not launch a second wave; the US carriers were out to sea and pose a threat. The Japanese Navy has a limited fuel supply. Mission accomplished. Would the sneak attack infuriate America? [Was the Washington meeting deliberately delayed?]   The Japanese also attacked the Dutch East Indies (oil), British Singapore, French Indo-China, and the Philippines. The success of the Japanese inspired both resistance to them, and later wars of national liberation in Indo-China, Indonesia and the Philippines. In 1926 E. Philip Oppenheim wrote a novel of intrigue where the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, while Germany and Russia attacked the east coast of America. This novel argued for the US to join the League of Nations. Would that have made a difference?
0307716511|5.0|This is quite clearly a literary novel which is about sisters who do not misunderstand each other no matter what.  Their love for each other leads to a justice that would have been impossible without the certainty of understanding another human being so intimately as only close sisters can. It is also a murder mystery that explores the inner life of a family changed by the tragedy of the death of a young brother a decade before, which initially leads to a slow distancing as time and lifestyle choices begin to fray the bonds of relationships  between siblings and parents, so slowly they are unnoticed while there are divorces and jobs and lovers pulling everyone to distant homes. An early tragedy, the death of a young brother to cystic fibrosis, emotionally scars the origin family beyond bearing, but while the parents careen away from each other, the sisters sustain and deepen their affection and caring. Back to the present, one of the sisters has gone missing. Suddenly what is important and what is not becomes clear and everything changes again. In finding out what happened to her sister, the other sister, Bee, discovers the answer to all the mysteries of her own self, while cutting the bonds from imposed limitations she was wrapping around her life.  These emotionally deadening choices  were forcing her to a safe, uneventful existence lacking much investment of feeling, probably because of the trauma of her brother's death and the subsequent leaving of her father. This is an intense book, beautifully written, a murder mystery, and an excellent exploration of a loving sister who despite enormous grief, finds love will power her through opaque veils designed to hide emotional truth. She discovers inner strength to press people who wish to intimidate her, including a fianc&eacute;, upper-class professionals, and police. She learns she has a good brain for clues and common sense, and to trust her judgement when no one else does. Unfortunately, when she has put many of the pieces together, but not all, the danger to her life is extreme. I had only one problem with this book - it is in the form of a letter to the missing sister and the voice is YOU YOU YOU throughout. I HATE HATE HATE that!  Ugh. Otherwise, I'd have put this on my favorites shelf.ces together, but not all, the danger to her life is extreme.

0446547654|5.0|This was a wonderful read. It had me in tears from the Begging till the End. I loved it so much, it so worth the time it took me to read it. I was so sad for Dawson's what he went through his entire life and till the end. For Amanda I was sad for what she went through, but hers was not as bad as Dawson's. Writing this review even has me in tears. Because the Love that Dawson had for Amanda it was so beautiful and felt bad that he could not enjoyed it with her like he deserved it.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I AM HAVING A GREAT TIME READING THESE REVIEWS!  But let's face it, Lou Reed has put out a lot music over the past 40 years.  People either love it or hate it.  He puts an album out and says: \\"Here it is - deal with it\\", no excuses, no apologies and he moves on.  His music has always been polarizing, just take a look at the feedback ratings on Amazon alone!  His music always seems to take time to be accepted. Years ago the Velvet Underground was considered a failure, today they are considered to be a cutting-edge 60's band.  Perhaps years from now Lulu will be an Avant Garde classic - maybe not. Either way it doesn't matter to Lou, it's in the past - he's done it.  Metallica fans are upset and understandably so - it isn't your standard Metallica by a long stretch.  And maybe that's point - Lulu is controversal and polarizing - the way Lou likes it.  I gave it four stars, it is an interesting album, and if it's goal was to be controversal, it hit the mark.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Handsome though it is, the packaging for this set invites you to bend, nic and smudge your new discs.  Each disc is slipped into a thick cardboard \\"page\\" in a \\"book\\". No cases, just a slot for each disc.  However each page is so thick and hefty it does not give at all when you try to remove a disc.  How to remove a disc from this set:  1. Stick your index finger on the edge of the disc of your choice. Realize nothing will happen if you try to remove it this way. Then stick your finger under the edge of the disc, be sure get a good smear on the data side.  2. Now lift the disc away from the backing. Note backing won't bend, nor will flap over top of disc so you must really pull to lift it away from the back.  3. Realize this isn't enough to remove the disc. To compensate: roll more of your index finger under the disc so that you can simultaneously bend and pull disc out.  4. Watch disc. Please note all lasers and explosions look horrible. They're super saturated and don't look real, or even look like they're really there. Very distracting.  BTW, the product photo of this set here on Amazon lies about the appearance of the box. In the provided image it comes off much thicker than it really is. When I got mine in the mail I almost didn't recognize it because it was so thin and unlike the photo of it.
B00005JLWN|2.0|Equilibrium is a fair movie. Almost everything about the production was quite good. But as so often happens with productions like this, it lacks philosophical depth. The conflict between parties is made too black and white. It would have been a much more interesting story if we knew the suffering that drove humanity to that condition, if there was some room for doubt that the protagonist was doing the right thing. A excellent movie leaves you with something to think about. This one does not.

Rapunsel appears to have big feet for such a petite girl. Really enjoyed the music used in the dance scene. I wonder what type of music that is so I could see if I could find more similar music.
0307477479|1.0|I had heard so much about this book and looked forward to reading it.  Wasn't sure I would last to the end - but I did.  A few chapters were quite good 'stand-alone' short stories, but the connections from story to story seem forced and I did not care about the characters or what happened to them.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I love the Harry Potter movies but this new Ultraviolet Digital Copy is ruining my opinion of Warner Brothers.  iTunes is much better and extremely user friendly from my experience - Ultraviolet will never match up.  They say that it works on iPhone or iPad but not having the flexibility to put it on my iPad and take it off whenever I want is ridiculous.  And with only 5 downloads, you better make sure you don't delete it too often or you won't be able to get it back on your portable device.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED CUSTOMER!!!  I wish I would have only purchased the Blu-ray and not spent the extra money to get the digital copy that I will never watch.  Thanks WB  - I'll be sure to never buy an Ultraviolet copy again.  UPDATE:  I also contacted Flixster and asked for an iTunes Digital Copy and they provided me a code for a REAL digital copy.  Thanks Flixster - I will continue to utilize your iPhone app!!!  VERY HAPPY CUSTOMER!
B004X80HEE|3.0|This may be called from beginning to end but when you get to the end, you're none the wiser, they're still halfbrothers, and i emphasize their different fathers almost as much as the DVD does, that are nice looking and enjoy each other's company. If that's sick or if it's not, I'm not sure but the yuk factor is kept below the surface by all those involved, including parents who probably should have stopped all this but by the time it gets to skype, they might as well be married for all the excitement this provides. Lovely people and scenery, that's about it.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I was surprised, but I liked this better than some of the Marvel Hero movies.<br /><br />Growing up, I was more of an Iron Man fan, the first film was pretty good  but the 2nd Iron Man movie was horrible.<br />I wish they had not screwed up Tony Stark's character and turned him into a sarcastic one-liner smartass instead of the troubled character he was in the comic.<br /><br />The Hulk movies were both pretty bad.<br /><br />Thor was OK.<br /><br />Ghost Rider was not too good.<br /><br />I liked the nostalgia of the 1940's Captain America.<br />Some editing and story development seemed chopped and rushed even at over 2 hours.<br /><br />But they successfully integrated all the classic elements of the Captain America character.<br /><br />I wish there was a little less camp .... it went a bit into \\"cheesy\\" at times.<br />This has nothing to do with the 40's time period ............ the cheese I refer to was an occasional tendency to get a little too carried away with witty humor and a \\"cuteness\\".<br /><br />So in the final analysis of Marvel hero films so far, I am adding the following to my DVD collection ........<br /><br />Iron Man # 1  (not # 2)<br />Captain America<br />Thor<br />Spider Man # 1<br /><br />Not Ghost Rider, not Hulk.<br />I don't have X-Men either.  These were done Okay, but for some reason, I never was interested in X-men in comics or the movies.<br />Not Fantastic Four.<br />Not Daredevil
0385337388|5.0|First of all, let me state that I haven't experienced yet the turmoils of a residency or internship.  I'm a second year medical student, so it was fascinating for me to see what lies ahead. I think it'll be even more interesting to re-read this book after getting through residency, and see how accurately it portrayed the experience.  The book is very similar in tone to \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" as it points out the contradictions and ironies of modern medicine.  In the book, it is implied that it is crueler to prolong the suffering of the 'gomers' (a derogatory term for elderly patients who are very ill, confused, and in a lot of pain, but still manage to avoid death) than to poke and prod them, doing one diagnostic test and procedure after another.  'Turfing', or sending a patient to another ward or department, is encouraged as an excellent way to get rid of patients that one does not want to treat.    There are two main schools of thought in the book: the first is the idea of physician as a healer and hero, portrayed by Jo, a female internist; the second is the idea of medicine as temporary modifications--some of which do more harm than good--represented by the \\"Fat Man\\".    Jo is a purist and what one would now call a \\"gunner\\"--a highly ambitious internist with her sights set on a cardiology fellowship; she believes that medicine is best taught by textbooks and best practiced aggressively and voraciously.  With Jo, every patient gets a full workup and plenty of procedures, which often lead to secondary infections and complications more damaging than the primary disease process itself.  To please her, the interns working under her often \\"BUFF\\" the charts (document tests and procedures that were not actually done) while waiting for the patients' conditions to resolve themselves.  The \\"Fat Man\\" is a cynical New Yorker with a voracious appetite and hopes for a GI fellowship.  He becomes a mentor to the narrator, Dr. Basch, and practices medicine based on hisown experiences (hence the ridiculous age + BUN = lasix dose rule), but has a natural gift for it that Jo and the other physicians do not.    Somewhere in the middle is Roy G. Basch, the protagonist who experiences many sleepless nights, sexual escapades, and conflicting thoughts about what it means to be a physician.  I don't want to give away the ending, but let's just say I loved it.  The book sheds light on the difficulties of dealing with life and death (hence the \\"House of God\\") and the high expectations placed on physicians.  It's definitely a worthwhile read, and a very honest look at the profession.
B005HEQIGO|2.0|Show is great, but the audio is horrible.  Like the previous reviewer, it sounds like the VHS player needs a new drive belt.. I quit watching.
0385534639|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Each page is spellbinding and magical.  The Author brings you into the novel which is very graphically detailed.  A+++
B005N0C0JQ|4.0|By now it's clear that, post-Oasis, some people are going to prefer Liam Gallagher's band Beady Eye and others Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. I like both, but think Noel's album is better overall. \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" is full of songs that say something worth hearing while being melodic and catchy -- in the best way.  The cover art gives a hint of what's to come. It looks as if Noel is standing under a lit carnival canopy, but the image is blurry, and if you look at it from a little distance the canopy looks like a menacing face with eyes. Welcome to one spooky fairground!  \\"Everybody's On the Run\\" isn't the best start for the album: it sounds overproduced, and would be more effective without quite so much of the background choir. But the idea of everyone carrying a burden and trying to get away from the past clearly resonates for Noel; he seems to mean what he's singing. \\"Dream On\\" is much better, with a slow, driving beat and an air of mingled despair and determination. \\"One day at a time / I'm hiding from a razor blade / That's hanging in the kitchen\\" is part of the lyric, yet the song doesn't sound simply sad or ravaged. Down but not out might do it.  It's on \\"The Death of You and Me\\" that things get eerie. The calliope/carousel sound on this track is a bit like that on the Beatles' \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" only creepier. The way the winding-down sound matches the running down of the relationship described in the lyrics is masterful. And the brass in this song sounds like it came out of a New Orleans funeral march.  \\"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in My) Record Machine\\" brings back the big production of the first track to better effect. The repeated lyric \\"Build a little fire where it's cold\\" creates more of an air of hopefulness, or at least escape from despair. \\"AKA . . . What a Life!\\", \\"AKA . . . Broken Arrow,\\" and \\"Stop the Clocks\\" are all high quality too. They  continue the general mood of grappling with difficult things withoutgiving up (and without getting sappy, either).  The songs I can't stop listening to, though, are \\"(Stranded On) The Wrong Beach\\" and \\"Soldier Boys and Jesus Freaks.\\" On \\"The Wrong Beach\\" Noel proves he can rock hard, and he packs real menace into the chorus: \\"So long baby, bye bye / Pour me one for the road / It's a long journey baby / Where it's gonna take me / Just depends on the weight of my load.\\"  And on \\"Soldier Boys and Jesus Freaks\\" he updates the Kinks' \\"Village Green Preservation Society\\" and the Beatles' \\"Penny Lane,\\" describing how \\"All the people on the village green / Have gathered round their TV screens\\" to listen to the politicians of the day. The brass parts take the horns in \\"Penny Lane\\" to a grittier place, fitting for a song that's  obviously disillusioned with the current social and political landscape.  In sum, this is an excellent first outing that sounds like a carefully sequenced album rather than a random collection of songs. Some listeners may find the sonic and thematic similarities to elements of 60s rock too much, just as some found Beady Eye's too much (not to mention Oasis'). But I think that both Gallaghers are bringing aspects of 1960s rock into the 21st century and mutating it to suit their own concerns and personalities. Here's hoping they both do more good work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My first book on Prime Kindle lending.   Sure to be a classic. Although written for young adults, there is nothing juvenille about the subject matter or the author's handling of her tale. Well-crafted; there is not an awkward phrase, sentence or paragraph in this futuristic tale of survival.     It's hard to assign stars to a book. I would like to only assign 5 stars to books I consider true literature but find myself assigning 5 stars to books I just can't put down, even when quality may be less than ideal. \\"Hunger Games\\" has quality and page-turning appeal. There should be a way to assign a double-5-star rating.   I could not put this book down and I'm looking forward to the next in series. I'm sure I will want to read it again. I think I will probably add this to my library after all.
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|This movie will bore to death even the most romantic people. Nothing makes sense or click in this movie. The only parts that entertained me was the lounge scenes, but the screenplay was equally bad as the rest of the movie. Not sure how Ryan Gosling decided to take part in this movie.
B001UV4XJ2|2.0|I loved the movie it was great, but I bought the three pack,Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy, because that is what I wanted. The fact that I can't use MY digital copy on all MY devices, really fracks me off. Just rude and really upsetting of the company to pull such an underhanded move.
0071752854|3.0|Oren gives some good pointers for making 'sales' pitches, even though he couches most of his pitches in terms of raising capital for new ventures. It's good exercise to try to imagine his techniques being applied in your line of business.   He gives a good perspective on the 'reptile brain' which you may find as a breakthrough in your own thought process. His emphasis on story and time is equally valuable, as is his insistence to keep 'analyst details for later' until we know we want to do business. I realized I used many of these ideas myself, but had not formalized them with the amount of research he has done. It's nice to put things in a framework always. Speaking of 'frames', his 'death match' concept of social interaction may not appeal to you, but it's a fresh perspective none the less.   For me the weak part were the stories, they got a little over the top, especially the climactic 'pull it all together' story where he spends weeks moping about in obscure resorts while a desperate friend lands in private jet on a small strip trying to get back to win a $1 billion deal, which he does elegantly.   He claims to know Hollywood scriptwriters as friends, and their effect or help shows as he narrates stories where he storms into a Ponzi scheme office and claims to be able to call the FBI in unless he gets the money back for his friend, or where he cuts off half an apple from one of the leading billionaire investors' plate 'to grab his attention'.  He even manages to make a gripping narrative out of a 'french waiter' situation.   Read this book if you're frustrated with your current sales method, if you're tired of making 100s of calls for making 2 deals, if you feel angry with the way you're treated in client office lobbies or if you just want to try something different.   Caution: this is strong sauce indeed, so try it with friends and colleagues before trying in formal situations.
B004EPZ07U|2.0|I loved the movie it was great, but I bought the three pack,Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy, because that is what I wanted. The fact that I can't use MY digital copy on all MY devices, really fracks me off. Just rude and really upsetting of the company to pull such an underhanded move.
0307887898|5.0|If you are an entrepreneur in the tech sector then you are likely already familiar with terms like minimum viable product, \\"pivot\\", and product development. Popularized by the author and Steve Blank over the course of the past two years, this book is arguably the (current) culmination of the movement and a great summary of the rationale, thinking, and the practical experience with these models. If some of these concepts are new to you, then this book is definitely the place to start, and if you have been following all along, then this offers a nice overall summary and a few great case studies.<br /><br />It was also great to see some discussion on application of these ideas within an enterprise (intrapreneurship), as opposed to just starting from scratch. All in all, a great book, and will undoubtedly be on most business bookshelves for some time to come. Even if you don't agree with all the ideas, a book every entrepreneur should read at some point.

1594484805|5.0|I purchased this book because it was required in my group membership.  I have read a lot of motivational books and been a part of either implementing them or the recipient of the product. Companies run back to the work place and shove it down the employees throats as fast as they leave the seminar.  This lasts for several weeks, the employees are more distraught, and then life goes on until the next motivational seminar.  Well, my friends, this is a an applied science about years of human behavior study by some of the most reputable people in the field of motivational science.  I hope it catches on in more businesses because people are not pawns, we are players.  Read it, share it, and practice it.  Intrinsic behavior is contagious, and that my friend, I welcome you to become affected.

B000J10EQU|2.0|What made this movie so...BAD?!!!    Brian Singer and his Idea that Brandon Routh should mimic Christopher Reeve's acting was a huge mistake. Now this is not me wishing it was Reeve playing Superman (or looking to far into things), Singer is the one who said himself that Brandon reminded him the most of Reeve and this is the main reason Routh was cast for the roll, as this movie was to be a sequel to the 1980 movie Superman 2. BIG MISTAKE!      The thing with Brandon that killed it for me was his lack of emotion and carisma as Superman (as Roger Ebert states from the Chicago Suntimes). Many say that it was the script and his lines which made him boring in the film, but even in the love scenes with Lois he was missing that connection and emotion for me.  With this said, Routh came off as a wanna-be, not nearly as good version of Chris Reeve, but it's not all his fault.  This was a huge mistake on Brian Singers part (Director) to cast an actor to play the roll of another actors interpretation of the Superman character. Basically Routh was acting to be Christopher Reeve, not Superman.   Spoiler ALERT!    Another huge problem for the movie is the fact that Superman leaves for 5 years, comes back to earth, only to find out that he has gotten Lois Pregnant before he left, and then ends up finding out he has a kid!  This goes against everything Superman stands for morally!!!         So basically, The son (Superman) becomes a father and the father becomes a dead beat dad who owes 5 years of back child support!        Another problem, Superman becomes a stalker!  When he finds out Lois has a boyfriend, he Fly's over to Lois house and uses his X-Ray vision to see through her house and spy on her! WTF!!!!  Creepy indeed!  The character of Superman would NEVER do such a thing, this is bad writing from 2 guys who did not understand the character.    Combine all this with lack of action, a bad story, and a wanna-be Chris Reeve, and what do you have... Superman Returns!    The newMan Of Steel movie is being made as I type this, to be released in 2013. It looks VERY promising, and from what has come out about the story, the leaked set pics, it's looking amazing!  This and the fact that the \\"BUFF\\" Henry Cavill has been cast as Superman, and he can act, is something to keep your eye on!     All in all, 2 stars for Superman Returns, and that's being generous!
B0058S0OMS|4.0|[[ASIN:B000UR9QHQ Halloween [Blu-ray]]] and the HALLOWEEN II BLU-RAY is a must have for any fan of the horror genre. For better or worse, the sequel and its predecessor were the movies that gave birth to a new type of \\"slasher\\" film and started a whole formulaic craze that continues to this day. Anyway, both HALLOWEEN and HALLOWEEN II have their moments and still pack a punch as a terror flick.<br /><br />The HALLOWEEN II Blu-Ray is pretty decent but there is some picture noise in the darker scenes that take place inside the hospital, which is the only fault that I can find. The rest of the picture is sharp and detailed and, aside from outfits and hairstyles, looks as though it were shot yesterday.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray has some special features like deleted scenes and a bonus movie, although I would've liked a present day interview with Jamie Lee Curtis.<br /><br />*****  BONUS FEATURES  *****<br /><br />* Alternate Ending & Deleted Scenes - 08:01-minutes -- \\"play all\\" button<br />There was one scene that should've been left in the movie that explains why the hospital is so dark. As is, the hospital just suddenly goes dark, particularly in the corridors and hallways, and I always thought that maybe the lights were turned off to let the patients sleep, but that doesn't make sense because the patients aren't in the hallways, LOL. Anyway, this one scene explains it.<br /><br />* Documentary Movie \\"Terror In The Aisle\\" - 01-hour:22-minutes<br />This 1984 movie is hosted by Donald Pleasence who starred in both Halloween movies (Dr. Loomis) and Nancy Allen ([[ASIN:B00005K3NR Carrie (Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00028HBJS I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]) . It shows the many films that have brought audiences chills and thrills and how horror movies have evolved.<br /><br />Anyway, this classic -- along with its predecessor -- deserve to be in your film library.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I love Christmas music and love Michael Buble, but was a little dissapointed with this CD.  However it is growing on me the more I listen to it.  I LOVED the mini-CD he did last year \\"Let it Snow\\" so I was expecting more of the same on this CD, but it doesn't have the same umph.  On a couple songs I feel like he departed from the original too much and my overall feel is it doesn't seem like he put the time into this one like he did the last one.  BUT, having said that, I would definitely buy this CD again and I would definitely recommend getting the Target version with the 3 bonus tracks because they're some of my favorites on the CD. If you like Michael Buble, you will still enjoy this CD, even if it's not your favorite.
0143039431|5.0|you may have read this 10, 20, 30, or even 40 years ago as a high school student, but do yourself a favor and read it again as an adult to understand our current economic system.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Take the SPARTACUS series...go back a little in time...experience the turmoil that set the stage for the greatest revolt in history. There you have \\"Gods of the Arena\\". It suffers no loss in writing, acting, set/staging or any other factor. This series stands alone in all its glory.<br /><br />So many revelations come to us while watching this series. Batiatus and Lucretia, while still rather despicable characters, display the human struggle to which we all fall prey. There are family squabbles Roman-style, inlaw situations, fertility issues, family business problems. Here we are enticed to feel some of the angst Batiatus has trying to be \\"the good son\\", to equal if not outdo his father's success. His marriage to Lucretia against his father's wishes is a thorn in his side. However, it is not his wife who causes him this pain. Lucretia while scheming, arrogant and sometimes cruel will support her man to the very end....and she does! Watching this family's dynamic is like watching a reality show today...mesmerising!<br /><br />Perhaps, some wonder if the lack of the character of Spartacus himself would not weaken this series...absolutely not! In the footsteps of all those gladiators before and after him, Gannicus too takes up the sword. Excellently played by Dustin Clare, Gannicus gives us everything we hope for in a hero. He is physically awesome, easy on the eye and an in-depth, fully-rounded character in his own right. Gannicus is perhaps a conglomerate of all gladiators and in his plight we can follow that track on which they are proplelled by fate. To train, to fight, to live for the glory and blood and agony of the arena, that was the life of a gladiator. Few were given their freedom at the end of a glorious career. For most, it was a gift just to see another sunrise, to touch the soft skin of an erstwhile lover one more time, to take one more breath before the roar of the ravenous crowds engulfed them.<br /><br />They are all here, Naevia, Oenomanus, Barca, the beloved Crixus etc. to draw us back into the thick air of the ludus, to lure us into the orgies and outright sinful fun of the house of Batiatus. New characters too, all insatiable in their own ways, rivet us to the screen, leave us longing to walk the rowdy streets of Capua beside them, to peek into their windows and out from under their beds....longing to be a part of the scene that was the Roman Empire.<br /><br />Watch it....if you loved Spartacus, chances are you will get lost in this series too. Fantastic fun!us back into the thick air of the ludus, to lure us into the orgies and outright sinful fun of the house of Batiatus. New characters too, all insatiable in their own ways, rivet us to the screen, leave us longing to walk the rowdy streets of Capua beside them, to peek into their windows and out from under their beds....longing to be a part of the scene that was the Roman Empire.

B0057VDGNK|5.0|Remember the mood that the soundtracks to Crash (movie) and Miami Vice (TV series) created? Drive is even better due to this artist's contribution. So, have you ever returned to see a movie just for the soundtrack (not saying that I did)?
0385534639|3.0|I was really excited about this book and bought it immediately. All of the hype about it being the heir to the Twilight-Harry Potter throne made me think it couldn't go wrong. It even sported a shamelessly Twilight-esque cover.   In my opinion, this should've skipped book form and gone straight into a screenplay. While Morgenstern  is certainly a talented writer and a master at description, I felt the book was empty as I didn't really feel I knew the characters any better at the end than I did in the beginning. She doesn't let you love them or get close to them like other writers do (Maybe that was the point? There seems to be a lot of emphasis on being a spectator throughout the novel). I found I wasn't too heartbroken when unfortunate things happened to characters, which is strange as I'm an avid reader and re-read my favorites and even cry on occasion. I found it hard to finish this book because I was constantly fighting the urge to put it down and read something else.   That aside, she does a great job with details and her imagination paints some very pretty pictures. Would I recommend this book? Not really. Check it out at the library, unless you just want a pretty book for your collection. Better yet, just wait for the movie to come out. It will be a much better in movie form.
B005DC68NI|5.0|'Let's Get Digital' is a most generous work. It's informative title does not really convey how clear, concise and logical it is. Its persuasion lies in the generosity of the author in making available a great deal of information that would take weeks for a novice to accumulate, and putting it all down with relevant links to essential resources. Because David Gaughran has obviously mastered not only the formatting issues and the marketing opportunities he gives a complete novice ( like me) the warnings that short sightedness might lead to, while retaining an understanding of uncertainties, and encouraging the reader that they are probably unnecessary. What this work also reveals is the often claimed sense of 'community' that is shared by independent minded self-publishers. Refreshing!
B000OEZ88G|4.0|In 1994, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras wrote the book Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies based upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.  The book focuses on the detailed histories of eighteen \\"visionary\\" companies.  These companies were selected based upon results from a survey sent to 700 CEOs from Fortune 500 and Inc. 500 companies.  The histories of these companies were contrasted to 18 \\"comparison companies\\" that were also successful within the same industry.  The two primary objectives behind their research were to \\"identify the underlying characteristics and dynamics common to highly visionary companies (and that distinguish them from other companies) and to translate these findings into a useful conceptual framework\\" and to \\"effectively communicate these findings and concepts so that they influence the practice of management and prove beneficial to people who want to help create, build and maintain visionary companies.\\"<br /><br />Through their research, Collins and Porras discovered \\"twelve shattered myths\\" and<br />developed four key concepts that are applied by visionary companies.  These concepts are as follows:<br /><br />1. Be a clock builder - an architect - not a time teller.<br />2. Embrace the \\"Genius of the AND.\\"<br />3. Preserve the core/stimulate progress.<br />4. Seek consistent alignment.<br /><br />These concepts were later developed through the researchers' \\"feedback loop.\\"  Collins and Porras conducted their research, developed concepts and frameworks, and then applied them to the real world to gain feedback and improve their research.<br /><br />Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies is a book that I would recommend to anyone who wants to work in business or start their own company.  While the book is somewhat dated, the concepts remain relevant as they lay a wonderful foundation and insight into the idea of a visionary company.  Although the research and methodology conducted by Collins and Porras was not perfect, the concepts that they have created are still invaluable assets to companies that want to be considered visionary.  These concepts are the successful habits of visionary companies, and it seems thus far that they were indeed \\"built to last.\\"ct, the concepts that they have created are still invaluable assets to companies that want to be considered visionary.

B004LROUNG|3.0|The book really started out well and I thought that maybe the Grisham of old was back. However, when I got to the finish I was very disappointed. It felt like he was just trying to end it. There are no plot twists whatsoever, and the ending is foretold 1/3 of the way into the book. In the end all I was left with was the regret of having paid for the book.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This movie is awful; boring, uninvolving, overblown, the list goes on.  Even 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, the form of which LIFE seems most to emulate, has many moments of personal exchange with characters, including of all things, HAL the computer.  LIFE is nothing but a series of pretentious episodes which fails to draw the audience in and make them care for what is going on.  An overrated mess.

0385733577|3.0|The 14th century alchemyst Nicholas Flamel has the secret codex containing the recipe for the elixir of life hanging around his neck. For centuries, Dr. John Dee has been hunting for him because he wants that book. Dee has finally traced Flamel to his bookstore in 21st century California. He busts in, gets all but the last two pages of the book, and kidnaps Flamel's wife. Now the world is in danger because Dee plans to bring the dark Elder gods to power and they will enslave humans. When twins Josh and Sophie witness the crime, they get dragged into the mess. Along the way, they learn that, OMG, there's a prophecy about twins saving the world!<br /><br />The most intriguing aspect of The Alchemyst: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel is the overall worldview that Michael Scott has developed. His elder god mythology accounts for all the other known pantheons, numerous archeological discoveries, various myths and legends (e.g., vampires, ghosts, Atlantis), historical events (e.g., the flood, the great fire of London, the Irish famine), real historical figures, and even fictional characters such as Frankenstein. I've seen this done before and I think it's a fun idea and has tons of educational potential for its YA audience, but I tend to become gradually annoyed as the author continues to add more and more to it until it just gets messy. I groaned out loud when Excalibur showed up and then nearly turned off the audiobook when the Witch of Endor had a New York accent and claimed to have given humans both fire and the alphabet. I have to admit, though, that the thought of the Morrigan shopping on eBay is pretty funny.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this world-building seems to be the main intent of the book, so the plot and characterization suffer. The characters are only superficially developed. We're told a lot about each of them, but by the end of the book it feels more like we've read their biographies than that we really got to know them. The plot mostly consists of running away, hiding, discovering prophecies, and suddenly gaining magical powers. It's predictable and lacks intensity and excitement. Instead, there's lots of dialogue and repetitive explanations designed to incorporate all of those disparate mythological and historical elements into the worldview.<br /><br />The plot has other problems -- people just don't behave reasonably. It was hard to take The Alchemyst seriously from the very beginning when, after centuries of hiding the codex from Dr. Dee and after telling him it had been destroyed, Nicholas Flamel whips it out so he can consult it to cast a spell at Dee... What? You've had that little book around your neck for 600 years and you didn't bother to learn the spell you need to cast against the enemy who's been chasing you for that long? And then you whip it out right in front of him when you know he's stronger than you? Unforgiveable.<br /><br />The Alchemyst is likely to be enjoyable for YA readers who like learning about mythology and history -- they'll learn a lot and perhaps their zeal will make them less prone to notice the shallow plot and characters. Adults with full bookshelves will probably be less satisfied. I read the audiobook version of The Alchemyst and found that the performance of the narrator, Denis O'Hare, made this book bearable for me. His delightful accents and inflections, and his genuinely serious performance, were entertaining.

Now I'm stuck w/a P.O.S. until they get more in stock, if they do!  **update 11/16/11...as suggested in the feedback I got below I contacted Amazon again and explained the situation & I was able to get a full refund on the book.

0838577016|5.0|I borrowed this text as an undergraduate electrical engineering student hoping to describe the \\"system\\" of the brain. It became very clear to me, early on, that this was no simple task. I learned a lot attempting this though, and this text was indispensable. Coming from an EE perspective, it was very difficult to sift through many other text books, because there wasn't a complete description of, for example, a cell membrane. This text really does tell a lot of detail. Maybe not enough for a med student, I can understand that, but definitely enough for an engineering student to get a grasp on the subject. The diagrams are awesome, and the descriptions are very good. It's the kind of book you can get lost in for hours. Very technical, yet surprisingly readable. I'm writing this review because I just purchased an older edition and I am thrilled that whenever I have a question about neurons (or related), I can reach over and grab what I consider the ultimate reference.<br /><br />In a nutshell: plenty of detail, vast amount of material covered, yet easy to read.

B00005V9HH|5.0|Probably Kevin Spacey's best performance and the rest of the cast does equally as well in this movie that has the ultimate twist in the end.  The plot is so twisted that most watcher's will have to see it twice to completely digest the subplot and the whole drama becomes increasingly possible in real life as the movie ends.  This is not a disappointing thriller but one that you'll want to keep in the archives to watch again on a rainy afternoon.

After repeated listenings (about 100 so far), I have realized what a genius Jack White is. Being able to blend rock, pop, jazz, blues, country, bluegrass, punk and grunge is a feat in itself. But being able to do it well is unheard of. After almost 4 years it is still on my mp3 player and listened to all the time. Thank you Jack White and Brendan Benson for creating a masterpiece that stands up year after year.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|Three besties go out skiing for the weekend. They don't want to pay full price, so they manipulate the lift operator to give them a round on the house. The kids felt like they didn't get enough that day. They convinced the operator to let them have the last lift. The operator guy felt the intense urge to piss. He left the machine in the care of another responsible guy. The kids are forgotten in the dark and no one can hear them in the vast cold abyss of nothingness. We are reminded at the beginning of the movie that these kids did not have their cell phones. They had no way of communicating to anyone once on the lift. It appeared that the kids would have spent a week on the lift without food, water, and shelter. After some research I found that a human can live a good while without food as long as the person is hydrated.  A person can last about 8-14 days without water depending on the person and how fast sweat, urine, and tears are leaving the body. You can live up to about 4 weeks without food depending on conditions like weight, temperature and exertion. SO with that in mind, we know that the kids had to face harsh weather conditions. By sitting the kids wouldn't be spending so much energy. I think they all would have survived the week. The biggest, most obvious mistake was jumping. There is no way to land safely jumping off of something that high. I guess he didn't study physics very well. I have no idea why the girl was scared to pee in her pants. You are stranded. Nothing matters but survival. Making wolves out to be monsters was unnecessary. Wolves do not attack people at random. Wolves are actually timid around people.  They would even leave their food to avoid a confrontation with people. Wolves will defend themselves when needed, but they aren't crazy man killers. What an awesome movie that misleads everyone about wolves. Overall, special effects were ok. The actors were a little less than average. You have to accept that these kids are weak idiots to move on with the movie. Otherwise you will be frustrated the entire time.

030788743X|4.0|I haven't had this much fun with a book in a long time. Cline knows the 80s better than anyone and uses that knowledge well.    The co-creator of OASIS, a live/work/play virtual universe, is stuck in the 80s, treasuring every movie, every song and every game - even clothing styles - from that decade.  His death triggers a vast, and deadly, treasure hunt for his fortune.   There were a couple of things I found predictable but, overall, it's a page-turner.  While arcade and video games feature prominently throughout the book, the reader isn't required to have first-hand knowledge of them.  I'm proof, never having been a gamer.  I played arcade games (pinball, skeeball, etc) a few times when I was a teen and that's it.  Told in first person, it's an easy and engaging read.  I didn't want to put the book down, especially when I was done.  MTFBWYA

His fellow rats don't appreciate him, so he goes off to practice his art on his own.  Along the way he meets a boy and helps the boy cook.  The climax comes when the rat cooks a dish for a food critic and the critic enjoys it.  Are you asleep yet?  The arch enemy is what?  A food critic.  Uhhhh...  I suppose that the redeeming message of this film is supposed to be something like  - \\"follow your dreams\\".  Maybe the message is \\"follow your heart\\" or \\"do what you love.\\"  You know, the basic idea is that you should believe in yourself and you will succeed in the end.  Yeah right - and maybe you should go to college and get an undergrad degree in art, philosophy, psychology, history, or one of the many other worthless degree programs.  You can also follow your heart to the kitchen, where you will be doing dishes and taking out the garbage.    Why are there so many worthless degrees you ask?  (yes, I can hear you thinking - I'm psychic).  Because the government subsidizes it with federal loans.  Before all the government student lending, a college degree actually meant something.  Some unwise politicians decided that hey, wouldn't it be great to give that opportunity to everyone?  Except the problem is that once everyone has the opportunity, it is no longer an opportunity - it is an expectation.  A college degree went from being something extra to something required.  Yes, the government helps fund the education, but now you NEED the education - and the debt to go along with it.  What else happens when the government funds it?  The price of tuition goes up.  Of course it does... the government is paying for it.  Then the colleges, with all this extra money, expand into offering worthless degree programs and paying teachers to do \\"research\\" while TA's teach the classes.  So what does this get youmy friend?  More debt for more school for a degree that is as valuable as toilet paper.    What the heck does this have to do with Ratatouille you ask?  (I told you I was psychic).  Ratatouille is a crime against our youth.  It says - hey kid, you might be rat, but guess what?  You just go on being a rat and stick to your dreams because some day you will go off to the big kitchen college in the city and cook your masterpiece.  You will get the girl and your friends will all realize they are wrong and see what a smart rat you were.    In reality, the kid is going to follow his dreams to college to get a political science degree and then realize that you can't actually get a job doing that.  His friends will continue to think he is a loser.  So will his wife or girlfriend, who will probably dump him for a dude with more money - or at least a nice car.  The guy will live out his days selling sunglasses at a kiosk in the shopping mall.  All this because his parents made him was Ratatouille.
0062011847|5.0|I went home this week twice. Back to Grosse Pte., and back to Discworld. I have an Ankh Morpork passport and a couple of coins and one of these days I'll be going there permanently, but until then I have Snuff to read. Commander Sir Samuel Vimes / His Grace, the Duke of Ankh / Blackboard Monitor Vimes is made to go on holiday to the country with Lady Sybil and Young Sam. It's too quiet, Young Sam takes a forensic interest in country poo, and then there's a lot of blood in the dark on Hangman's Hill. We get all the womping great storytelling Pratchett is master of, in a whodunit with dastardly deeds, musical heroines, most of the Watch, a wild chase scene on a river aptly named Old Treachery and an intriguing new look at Willikins, Vimes' gentleman's gentleman. I love Pratchett's sharp knife of social commentary sheathed in a soft scabbard of high good humor. The laughing here has pointier teeth and more tenderness together, and I like that. There are some of the finest phrases Pratchett has ever written... \\"as cold as charity\\" is one that took my breath away. Now I want to read the whole Discworld series over again just once more.
1400052181|5.0|This was our Book Club Read for the month of November and I am very anxious to discuss it this evening.  I was so excited we could get this book (we get all our books through inter-library-loan, so newer/popular books are hard to get) as I had been wanting to read it for awhile.<br /><br />Even though this book is labeled non-fiction, most of the story read like a novel.  Skloot took great care to tell the story of Henrietta and her family and then tell the story of the cells using words and descriptions for the lay-person.  I never once got bored reading through the scientific part of the book, but was instead incredibly fascinated.  Throughout most of the book, I know my mouth was hanging open as I was in shock at the things that were happening to Henrietta and her family.<br /><br />I found the beginning of the story very fascinating because Henrietta died in 1951, just a few years before my own grandmother died of ovarian cancer.  Even though the 1950's doesn't seem that far away, the world in relation to other races and the medical world were much different that what they are today.  So much has progressed and changed it is hard to take it all in.  I think of my mom and her sisters and wonder if they had much of the same feelings Deborah, Henrietta's daughter, had about missing her mom. I think of my grandma and wonder how she managed her feelings of despair and fear after finding out her diagnosis, knowing she was leaving 5 daughters behind.<br /><br />There was so much to learn about cancer, cells, and medical research that I feel like I could continue to read on this subject forever.  Even since this was written in 2009, I wonder how much has changed or progressed just since then.<br /><br />I appreciate that Skloot has set up a scholarship fund for the decendents of Henrietta and that many of them are going on to college - even in the science field.  They are the ones that can change the course of their family's history and make a difference in their own right.<br /><br />I can't stress enough that this book should be read.  As a woman, as a mother, as someone who receives medical care - this book has opened my eyes and has given me a new appreciation for the research and advances in medical care that we have seen and will continue to see in our lives.n't stress enough that this book should be read.

1439102732|2.0|I was so excited to see a book that had a character who is a music therapist! (as someone who is in school for this exact field, it made me so happy). However, once I start reading all I see are how awful Christians are and how much we hate gay people. This was such a let down. This is just yet another person putting Christians as a stereotype, yet they seem to hate us when/if we do it (not to mention throw the good ole \\"thou shalt not judge\\" scripture in our face). I have nothing against gay people. I feel like I should show them the same love i show anyone else. Because that is what jesus wants us to do. So please quit writing books about all of us like we are constantly standing around with our \\"God hates fags\\" signs. I would NEVER say that.<br />This could have been an amazing book that really got the word out about Music Therapy, and how wonderful it is for patients. i am so disappointed that this is not what this story was. I realize the story needed more plot that just \\"hey look at me at work\\", but really? You just had to go there. Not all Christians are as crazy as that Westboro church...So quit making us all look that way please<br />I will say that the parts of the book that did mention Music Therapy were really spot on. I enjoyed those parts of the book immensely! I also like the \\"soundtrack of your life idea\\", and think I might just implement that in at some point in the future with work..But the rest of the book..was lacking to me..Not as good as some of her other work.
B004I11VZA|5.0|Great second movie about a legend in the martial arts world. Love the movie almost as much as the first one.
B003CR9BYE|3.0|this is a small thing...but i have an old Warner/Reprise Loss Leader lp, SCHLAGERS, that has a previously unrealeased cut from the first collaboration album. the song is called SABIA, and its very lovely. surprising they did not include it on this compilation. just for you completists!
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Another predictable movie from hollywood. Fun, cool stuff happening all the time and with the greatest cast comprised of every action star possible how could you not like it. 1 or 2 times watched but hey if friends come over that have not seen it and they want to watch it then it might see the light of day again.
068817776X|4.0|The book itself is just okay but I have to say I was very impressed with the quality of the used book. It looked brand new and it arrived pretty quick. I will definitely order from them again.
B002ZG99CC|3.0|I loved the original so much that I figured how bad could it be. Wrong. This movie was ok. I still can't figure out why 11/12 year old KIDS need a make out section in the movie. What kind of message are we sending the youth of today. I would rather see kids shoot people than tell them its ok to be sexually active that young. Jackie chan's character was ok and the overall outcome was a snoozer.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|I just wanted to say that I think this item is way overpriced (like most things nowadays).  The hard back piece is simply plastic and fairly cheap looking, while the cover looks and feels like rubber coated cardboard with felt on the inside. The whole thing probably cost around fifty cents to make.  Also, there is no locking mechanism for the stand feature, the edge of the cover just presses into the notch on the back of the case... which will probably work fine until you touch the Kindle.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I used Pocket Informant on my itouch and loved it, but when I switched to an android smartphone, I couldn't find a calendar/productivity app that was comparable.  Even PI for Android didn't impress me at the time, and Google Calendar was just too simple.  PI is discounted now through Amazon, and so I gave it a go.  I really like the interface.  Also, it's important for me to be able to tweak the colors and settings, and PI allows me to customize all I want.

0321687299|1.0|This was a huge disappointment.  Actually, a total rip-off.  It appeared that this was a \\"rush\\" job to get something published on a relatively new and hot topic and grab a few bucks.  This is one of the worst efforts I have seen, and appears to have been done in a long weekend's work effort. not a single topic has any degree of information that could not be obtained in just a few moments of searching the Internet.  I see that the same authors now have an \\"Edition 2\\" as if there have been so many changed to HTML5 that a second edition is needed.  Perhaps they got together for another weekend.  I will never buy another book that these authors are associated with.  Save your money and your time if you see these two again.
0743243153|5.0|I've read this book numerous times because it contains valuable advice on succeeding in life both personally and professionally.  With years of experience in psychology, Dr. Peck describes many of his patient's stories which are fascinating in themselves.  But the real value is Dr. Peck's advice that he gives to avoid falling into the traps of his former patients.  I would also recommend his other books as well.
B0000028WC|4.0|I guess I'm fortunate to have a sealed copy in vinyl of this. I was looking through my vinyl collection yesterday and found it. Didn't even remember having it. So the price here  for this record in vinyl really surprised me. It seems to me this would be a good one to put out on 180 gram vinyl, since vinyl has been having quite a big resurgence the last few years. I'm glad  too that I never got rid of my vinyl collection like so many people did. I've got a lot of original master recordings of some top records that I bought for \\"a song\\" that are now way up there in price range. Why this spectacular recording is not reissued to 180 gram vinyl and DVD is probably all contractual crap involving different labels and artists.  So, I think I'll get one of those album frames you can buy now and hang it on the wall for no other reason than posterity and wait for the powers that be to do the right thing and put this  out on high end vinyl and especially DVD. In the mean time, the CD gets played a lot!

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I'm on my third pair of px21's and every single time the wiring gets jarred after about month or so of use. I was pretty surprised when they broke on me the first time since I'm good with my electronics so I chalked it up and said \\"ok maybe I did something wrong\\". Got my second pair and about three months in, same thing. Got my third pair, and again same thing.   The wiring gets loose in the amp where either the overall sound loses a signal or the voice communicator loses a signal. It doesn't matter how delicate you treat these things, they will not last long enough to be worth a damn.   I've had Sony Studio Monitors for five years, that's five years, before they stopped working.   Your best bet is to either buy a warranty for these things or look for other gaming headphones. Even though the sound quality is pretty good, their reliability isn't.   I will be getting my fourth pair tomorrow since they are still under warranty. The warranty has better value than the px21s. Trust me.
B000S0GYRU|1.0|Perhaps my dim view of this movie is because I cannot seem to get hold of Argento movies.  In any case this one gets boring instead of better. After a dynamite murder scene early on, the ensuing scenes are far too dark and the music extremely loud. I will bore the reader no further as my title for this review speaks clearly enough.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|loved this movie, but the only reason I bought the BLUE-RAY/DVD + DIGITAL COPY combo pack was FOR my digital copy. IT'S A RIP OFF!!! first i was forced to sign up for ultraviolet & flixster which pissed me off b/c i dont want either service plan! + my downlaod is taking forever & I just found out I will NOT be able to add it to my i-pod classic b/c you need a flixster's app to access your download onto your device. But I cant get the app b/c i have a regular i-pod which was never a problem until today. Plus, even if you can get the app which will only work on the I-pad, I-pod touch or on certain smart phones, it doesn't go into your movie file which means you need to use your interent data plan to play it. Even though the app gives unlimited cloud service, YOU still have a LIMITED data plan. so if you only have 30 minutes left, you might not be able to finish your movie at the park or bus stop or something. EVEN if this whole thing works for you it's a long pain in the butt process that is NOT worth the money i paid, I am so GLAD I at least caught the sale price.   MY SUGGESTION: Buy the regular Blue-Ray or DVD & if you have to have the digital copy, bootleg it in protest of this stupid system!
0545265355|5.0|This past year, 2011, I read the trilogy. It was recommended to me by another adult reader. The trilogy is very hard to put down once started. I put it on par with the Harry Potter series with the suspense, action, (yes there is violence), and the open-ended conclusions with each book.  I would recommend this book trilogy to readers middle teens through adults. I think you'll love it!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|FRUSTRATING...I pay extra for the digital copies of movies.  This item arrived today and I found that the digital copy is actually a SD streaming version through flixter.  What a rip-off.  DO NOT BUY!!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I loved the first three books in this series but when I got to the fourth and fifth books the layout and narrative had completely changed - it's as if I'm reading something written from a completely different author. The story line takes forever and is very hard to get into which is totally different from the first three books in the series. I want to know how it ends but I don't think I'll be able to suffer through another boring book like the last two... Maybe I'll just wait for HBO...
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I Loved Matched, Crossed was good, but I lost track of the story. The poetry was just too much and distracted from the main line. Can't wait for the 3rd book.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I have little new to add to the current string of 1 stars other than Amazon should have been more upfront with its customers about what we were getting into. I purchased this copy months ago when all that was advertised was a \\"Digital Copy\\". This is incompatible with iTunes, and therefore useless to me. Buyer beware: if you order for a functional digital copy, you'll be disappointed.
0061928356|4.0|As the mother of a child adopted from a foreign country I was particularly drawn to this story.  For me it started out as a 5 star book but lost a little something along the way.  I agree with other reviewers who have said that the American characters are less well developed than those in India.  The author's description of life in America seems to pale by comparison to the rich texture and cultural detail of Indian life. I also found it hard to believe that Asha's adoptive Indian grandmother was so completely accepting of her since she would have come from a lower caste. Still, the parallel stories of Asha's two families make for a compelling and enjoyable read. I'd recommend this book.

B004LL1HM4|5.0|There are hardly the words to describe how utterly, sometimes painfully beautiful this album is.  The title song of the album is a quietly epic piece about individuality vs. conformity.  It sounds like growing up - when you're young, all you want is to be something special, unique and unlike any other.  As you get older, you begin to see the beauty of \\"a functioning cog in some great machinery.\\"  Having a job, a family, a life and knowing that you're part of the ecosystem that is the earth, the solar system and the cosmos.  It's a beautiful, humbling thing!    I truly think that this album topped their previous, a feat I thought could not be possible.

1466401885|5.0|This is one of the few books I've read that is completely compelling and pulls you in from page one until the very end. If there's one thing I'd like to have known before purchasing this read, it would be the knowledge that I wouldn't be able to do anything but read it! I could not put this book down, and when I absolutely had to, it was all I thought about, in anticipation of what would happen next.  Here is the synopsis I copied straight form the publisher:  \\"The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn't drink or swear, and she has the appropriate percentage of cardigans in her wardrobe. Abby believes she has enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college with her best friend America, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by Eastern University's Walking One-Night Stand.  Travis Maddox, lean, cut, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs--and wants--to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the charming college co-ed. Intrigued by Abby's resistance to his charms, Travis tricks her into his daily life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain abstinent for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis' apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match.\\"  In my opinion, the synopsis does not prepare you for the exciting roller-coaster that is Abby and Travis's relationship in the story. Travis is truly taken with Abby, so much so that she becomes everything to him.   To me, a good romance is something that pulls you in, makes you feel that butterfly sensation in your gut, and makes you think \\"that's the kind of guy I want\\", or \\"I want someone to do that for me\\". Beautiful Disaster did all of the above to me and more, and even though I read it for the first time nearly three months ago, to this day I go back and read my favorite parts.  Jamie McGuire knows how to write a romance, that's for sure.  READTHIS BOOK!

1451627289|5.0|High school teacher, Jake Epping, is given a chance to go back in time to 1958 via a portal in the back of a greasy spoon restaurant in Lisbon Falls, Maine.  Jake makes it his mission to stop the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963.  Yes, this is the kind of story that one could read in a \\"Twilight Zone\\" comic book years ago, but in Uncle Stevie's hands the tale comes alive.  Mr. King not only gives you the pop culture vibe of the 21st century in this time travel yarn, he gives you the 1950s and 1960s as well.      He tells you what it was like to get a root beer served with a full head of foam from a glass mug.  He tells you what it was like to dance with a pretty girl at a high school hop on a Texas evening.  It wasn't all good, though.  He also reminds you what it was like to inhale cigarette smoke everywhere you went.  And he reminds you that a disgruntled, confused young man could change the history of the world.    This book gets off to a slow start, but once you fall into the \\"rabbit hole\\" of \\"11/22/63\\" you won't want to come out until the very end.  Will Jake be able to stop the gunman or gunmen?  Will he want to return to 2011 after the discoveries he makes during his time in the previous century?  Set aside a weekend to let Uncle Stevie take you back to the 50s and 60s.

1451627289|5.0|Stephen King has long relied on the everyday details of American life to create believable stories. This believability is what has made many of them scary. No matter how farfetched or outlandish, we buy into them just enough to keep turning the pages.<br /><br />This time around, he takes us through a wormhole of sorts into the past. This wormhole always lands back in 1958, but returns the time-traveler to the present with only two minutes gone by. Can Jake go back, live for five years, and change the world's very future by stopping the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. The concept is a gripping one, but can it really keep us turning 842 pages? It sure can!<br /><br />\\"11/22/63\\" is a wonderful, nostalgic, frightening, and mind-bending trip, and according to King it's a story he wanted to write four decades ago. Instead, we get this tour de force with the gift of hindsight and foreknowledge, making it a much more poignant commentary on things past and present. In King's skillful hands, we learn the rules of this time-travel, we buy into its possibilities, and we care about our intrepid but very human narrator. We care even more when Jake tries to save one of his students in the present from a horrific family murder in the past. We care the most when Jake meets Sadie, a long-legged, stumbling but not clumsy lady who wins his heart and changes his direction.<br /><br />Sure, we want to see what happens when Jake meets Lee Harvey Oswald. Sure, we want to know if he'll save JFK. And, even more important, what that action would produce in the future. Most of all, though, we want to believe in love and fate and purpose and destiny. Somehow, King manages to give weight to all of them without explaining away their complexities too simply. In his time-traveling story, the past doesn't want to be change, and yet it harmonizes in many ways with the future. The Land of Ago, as he calls it, is intricately linked to the Land of Now, and to mess with the former can cause titanic shifts in the latter.<br /><br />If \\"The Stand\\" was King's masterpiece of his own Land of Ago, \\"11/22/63\\" is the masterpiece of his Land of Now. This is easily one of my favorite reads of the past year or two. I cared about these characters. I believed this could be happening. I laughed. I got misty-eyed. And I turned the final page with a stronger belief than ever in the power of love and the need to accept the past for what it is, good and bad, and look ahead.The Stand\\" was King's masterpiece of his own Land of Ago, \\"11/22/63\\" is the masterpiece of his Land of Now.

B004LROUNG|3.0|The story line is good and it flows easily, but the passion in Mr. Grisham's writing is missing.  I miss his can't-wait-to-turn-the-page writing style from his earliest books.  This is a good read, but it's not great.  It's one of those books that will help you pass a few hours of time, but once you read the last line and close the book you won't be feeling like I wish it hadn't ended.

I thought this book would help \\"matched\\" have some movement, but it literally goes nowhere, as well. same ridiculously stupid ending.

1596912863|3.0|It was cute. Jane is a 32 year old single female, living in NYC, who has had her fair share of bad luck with the opposite sex. As any good Austen fan, she secretly dreams of her very own Mr. Darcy. Cue an eccentric aunt bequeathing her a trip to \\"Austenland\\" (although I was never sure if it was to help Jane live out her fantasy or make her realize that Darcy IS just a fantasy).  A bit farfetched for me - I love Austen, took a class on her in college, have seen both recent movie adaptations, but would never go away for three weeks to play in her world. But I did appreciate the nods to several Austen books besides P&P such as Emma, Mansfield Park and Sense and Sensibility. I thought the airport scene at the end was crazy! Hm. I didn't know that Martin felt that strongly, his whole thing kind of came out of left field for me. As for nobly/Henry, well after all, this is an Austen-based novel, so...  Cute and a nice try, but forgettable.

She wanted to make the story relevant today, but I feel like both stories are relevant today and they would have been more powerful and left a stronger impact if developed separately.  The Vel' d'Hiv Roundup isn't something we (Americans) learned in school, and I didn't know France (albeit occupied) participated in the round up of Jewish men, women and children, arresting 13,152 Jews, many of whom died in Auschwitz. I appreciate the historical significance of this novel and after reading it, did my own research on Vel' d'Hiv. Despite knowing what lied ahead for Sarah and her parents and her little brother Michel, I was more anxious to finish THAT part of the story than Julia's part of the story. When I finished Sarah's part and realized there was a good chunk of the book left, I couldn't imagine what else there was to say. I did like meeting William, but his character was too thinly drawn for me to really connect with him.  As for the modern-day story of Julia, it's not a fresh story and I feel it interfered with Sarah's story (even though they were supposed to interfere, I didn't LIKE the interference). I would have liked Julia and Bertrand and his weird family to be separate. It was clear from the beginning that Julia and Bertrand didn't belong together because he belittled her, didn't \\"get\\" her and constantly put her down in front of his family. I guess through learning Sarah's story Julia questioned her own life and her own strength, but the stories didn't have to be SO intertwined. Each new chapter was 2 pages on Sarah and then two pages on Julia. I felt the book would have been a better read if we read Julia's story and then we learned of Sarah's story as Julia got read to moveinto the new apartment. I felt like I couldn't get REALLY into one story vs. the other until they merged and by that time I was just concerned about Sarah.  Still I would recommend this book because I believe many readers could connect with several characters in this book, and the book leaves you thinking \\"what if\\" at the end.

0393338398|4.0|Being a baseball fan, I liked this book a lot. I especially enjoyed the chapters on the 2002 draft and the trade deadline dealings for Ricardo Rincon. I thought Michael Lewis had a lot of detail that would quench the thirst of any die-hard fan, especially of a Oakland A's fan. Sometimes I had to read sections twice because there were so many players being named, but I didn't mind that.  I did wind up googling all the players to find out where they ended up - I wanted to know how right Billy Beane was. Turns out, he's pretty smart. I would recommend this book to any baseball fan, not just an Oakland fan.  And for anyone who doesn't believe in the importance of On-base-percentage....*sigh* you're not a real fan are you?

0307474712|3.0|Started in June 2010. Finished August 2011. Review written August 2011 for goodreads, published on Amazon on Nov. 15.  ** spoiler alert ** I started this MONTHS ago -- actually almost a year ago -- and I had trouble getting out of the early 20's, when Emma was a cook and Dexter was starting to become famous, mainly because I couldn't understand why someone like Em would ever consider being friends with such a jerk like Dex. It also reminded me of a past friendship I had (and lost) and it was kind of painful to read. But I got over it. And I was severely bothered by the letter that Dex forgot to send Em that remained in that book \\"Howard's End\\" that remained on Heidi Schindler's shelf. I thought that was extremely sad and it bothered me for a while. The book was so real though, and that's what I liked so much.  Now, with the commercials on TV about the movie with Ann Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, while I don't plan on seeing the movie, I want to finish this book...I've made it into their 30's so I'm hopeful. The book takes place on July 15 every year from 1988 until 2007, one day in the lives of Dex and Em.  _________________________________________________________________________________  Update: I'm shocked. Before finishing I KNEW Emma's fate, but I wasn't aware of HOW Emma arrived at that fate until I got to that part in the book. It made me so mad. Yes it was completely out of left field, and cold-hearted and callous of David Nicholls. I've read conflicting reviews, saying it's realistic, that he doesn't shy away from the terrible hand fate deals us in relationships, etc. I'm not sure how I feel about all this. It's a love story, it's realistic, but so sad.  For the entire book I was on Emma's side, wishing she'd dump Ian, succeed at her book, and be happy with herself -- not \\"settle\\" as I felt she'd been doing the entire story (and god, stop sleeping with the headmaster! he sounds terrible!). As for Dex, I got his mindset. He was young, he was handsome, he was somewhat famous, he was enjoying life. He thought he had the world at his fingertips and could do anything he wanted. A bit shallow for most of his life, drug-addict, definite alcoholic. But there was good somewhere in his lost soul, every now and then you got a glimpse of what Dex could be, which was much better than he was.  Was I pleased when Em and Dex became \\"Em and Dex\\"? Sorta. I knew it was coming, and I'd seen the promos for the movie on TV. However, I wasn't that pleased. Em could have gone out with Jeane-Claude. Dex was so used to getting his way and Emma just like gave in. Dex said it was time for them to get together and she said ok. Maybe it was time for them, but Emma, don't just give in because Dex says it's time! Still, Dex always knew he was a better person with Emma, she drove him to try harder.  Maybe the moral of the story is that you have 1 great love, and sometimes fate is nice to you and you actually get to experience it (but it may take 15 years), and even if you do, fate can be cruel and snatch it away right.  I thought the ending of the book would have been stronger if it was more of Dex looking through the boxes of Emma 1 and Emma 2, and the flashbacks to July 15, 1988, instead of talking about Dex getting wasted off his ass and having to be driven to his father's house, and Dex and Maddy. Who cares about Dex and Maddy? But the last part of the book, the last hours of their first meeting, were probably the most wonderful of the entire book.  Whose story was this? Em's or Dex's? I felt so robbed of Em's story! But not every story has a romantic ending.
0553386794|5.0|This is the book I've been wanting to read for a long time now. The television series, if you haven't seen it, is incredible. The book was every bit as good as the show and filled in lots of details that were in the shows, but now have an explanation and a background. I think I even preferred watching the show and then reading the book.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|** spoiler alert **   I thought this book was really funny and I enjoyed it a lot. I felt like Emma thought the same things I thought and did the same things I'd do if I had the chance (pour orange juice in my annoying co-worker's plant for example, but I would NOT talk to a stranger on a plane). Her list on the first few pages of the book definitely mirrored stuff I'd say. I was immediately hooked, and I like those kind of books.  This was a light-hearted and fun read, although a bit out there. I thought Jemima's character was kind of unnecessary, but I adored Lissy, Emma and Jack. Kinsella painted Connor so perfectly I felt like I could actually see and hear him, and the showdown between Emma and Kerry was awesome. One of my favorite scenes in the book was between Jack and Emma in the elevator, And I liked how Jack tried so hard to make their first date perfect with the champagne and the red peppers, but he missed that half the fun is picking stuff out yourself :)  The romance isn't entirely believable, but you know what you're getting into when you pick up the book (something fun, nothing too deep and a sort-of predictable ending). I must say, things happened faster than I thought they would (I figured the Connor-Emma storyline would go much further than it did, and I was pleased to see it did not).
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I used to be a huge fan of Drake when he 1st came out. Due to his mainstream success I stopped listening to him due to the repetitive airplay well the whole young money crew on the radio. This album made me have a different opinion about him. Sure hes going to get a Grammy award I mean Who else is going to compete for it besides lil Wayne?!

I cannot believe that the leadership continues to get away with treating people so poorly.

B004VF68AQ|3.0|After quite some time, Jane's is back with a new album.  In a bit of chaotic infighting with still trying to solidify their lineup, the band worked out another album from what looks like a line up of rotating bass players.  Gone (it seems) is Eric Avery and a production work not inclunding former bassist on the Strays album Chris Chaney.  The Great Escape starts off well with Underground, a driving hypnotic intro and pulsing distorted basslines.  Navaro adds some color effects as well.  End to the Lies follows which comes off as a pot shot at former bassist Eric Avery, whether this is the case or not one could argue, however after two songs it's noticeable who is doing real well on the album.  After two songs Dave Navaro is layering constant effects, multiple tracks and tones. It's more like the classic driving atmospheric guitar work he's known for.  He's a brilliantly underated player and seems very much in his element here.  Stephen Perkins is as good as always, and pardon the pun doesn't miss a beat either.  Musically though Navaro is doing real well.  However, many times the album stumbles.  There's some corny lyrics, some songs seem to be stuck in a rut and don't really go anywhere.  Some of the songs seem unfinished ideas, with great parts, but also hastily slapped together.  After a few songs the album doesn't seem to catch up, and falls a bit of a dud.  It's real unfortunate because there are some great pieces in here.  THe beginning of I'll Hit You Back sounds like something that should be off The Cure's Disintegration album, Twisted Tales comes off with some great vocals and melancholy, but the music on it seems like an afterthought.  It's as if the band brought out a sampler and just pushed play.  Broken People just comes off as a simple ordinary pop song and not a particularly good one either.  Words right of my mouth with it's psychiatrist intro and then punk like aggression, doesn't really have the energy and doesn't gel with the rest of the album.  Aside that, it's unfortunatly not that memorable, it comes at the end unlike anything else before it like a big \\"what the\\"?  Some of the bass lines are driving, and full of color, such as on Irresistible Force, but then other times the bass lines are an afterthought and hardly even noticeable.  Most of the time the album has all the right pieces, but there is nothing here that makes me want to listen to a song more than once.  It's good, but not great.  There isn't even a song on here as good as True Nature from Strays.  I can understand the bands interpersonal member problems, but I thought after Strays the members moved forward with Chaney and were at least going forward.  Now it just sounds like they are just stuck.  I have nothing against Eric as a player and he would be great to be around but at this juncture it sounds like it's impossible.  However, the band tried to make an album sort of without a \\"fourth\\" and it shows.  Something is \\"missing\\" and no it's not Eric, it's the ability to go ahead and be JA.  The Great Escape is an album that has everything it needs to do well but the rocket ship just doesn't take off.  The band just needs to get a solid bass player and buckle down, move on, and work on creating good music and dropping the problems.

It's just not. No matter how much they say it is. It's a passcode for a streaming service you probably will hate too. HAAATE. Flixster/UltraViolet/WB's Hairbrained Idea Dept is responsible for the low rating on this otherwise excellent film.
1419702203|1.0|THIS BOOK WAS A RIP OFF-- A BIG THICK PICTURE BOOK OF OLD,USED,REHASHED PICTURES. VERY VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON ANYTHING---CERTAINLY NOT A BIOGRAPHY IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best science-fiction/fantasy novel I have read since \\"Game of Thrones\\" and worthy of the same praise. Suzanne Collins writes as beautifully as George R. R. Martin and even Robin Hobb. When like me you are in your late 50s having read innumerable SciFi/fantasy books that barely satisfy my jaded palette, it is extraordinary to find a writer with such an original theme that is unforgettable. The trilogy is set in a a post-dystopian America that has partially recovered from some tragedy, but a small elite has seized power and holds down the vast majority by extreme and brutal means. The inevitable revolution occurs, first started by coal miners, and then develops in a bleak and violent manner. The revolution eventually succeeds after many unexpected plot twists but without a happy ending.   The book reflects post-Modernist pessimism and a collapse of society from capitalist implosion or adverse climate change although the author only hints at these premises, preferring to set the story immediately in a century or so from the present. It projects modern trends and comes up with a future society where extreme violence becomes a game show and is used as an object of repression. Not dissimilar to the Roman Empire where gladiatorial games were used as an instrument to emphasise state power and subdue the populace.  And it is hard to believe the story is chiefly aimed at young adults.   It is a page turner that for the first time in years kept me up all until dawn reading the entire trilogy. It deserves a far wider readership that being placed on the young adult shelf, though I would certainly urge any serious teenager to read it and reflect on the possible future direction of western society. Well done Suzanne Collins and I anticipate your next book.

I thought well heck, that's the same price you would pay for a regular guide at Gamestop, Wal-Mart, etc. so I bought it. This is one of the most well constructed guides I have seen, all the detail you need for all the quests, crafting, and so on. I always said I would not give more than 25 dollars for a guide, but this is the one exception. In my eyes it is worth every bit as much as the game itself. It seems to be a very sturdy, well put-together guide, highly recommended to anyone that loves The Elder Scrolls or even to first time players alike.
0553801473|1.0|I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere (not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time). After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book. Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters, moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next. Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come (by 2023 given his present pace). I think that he has written himself into a corner, he has no idea of how the plot will end, if it ever will.

1451627289|5.0|As any Back to the Future fan knows, you can't alter the past without the future being altered.<br /><br />This is Stephen King's best novel since the infamous car accident that almost killed him.  There is humor, horror (of the human variety), tension, romance, and a narrative flow that makes this 800+ page story read as if it were only 25% as long as it actually is.  For a change, King's writing is taut, and there are few superfluous scenes or chapters in this book.  I felt emotionally charged almost the whole way through, and wish I could read this again for the first time.<br /><br />If Mr. King were to retire now, he'd be going out at the top of his game.

0312576463|4.0|The negative reviews are not wrong: the most salient critique is that the characters were simply unbelievable.  People do not act like that.  They do not smush their hands through their own feces to find a $200 wedding band, just to take one example.  The obsession with sex is outrageous.  That said, I found myself wanting to finish the book, and I think that is the most basic quality a novel should have.

The characters (buggers!) are fantastic. Brilliantly executed novel about xenophobia, leadership, war, and life in general, told in a simplified, easy to grasp way that is surprisingly stirring and intuitively complex. I really can't do this story justice. Just read and find out for yourself. You can't be disappointed.

B005D9B26E|5.0|Quadrophenia is the second best Who album after Who's next ad certainly their best opera. The whole concept is exceptional from the start: in the 70's mod mailman Pete Townshend wrote an opera about the 60's mods period using the best musical technology available: synthesizers, quadrophonic sound , horns etc. All this to recreate an era of much more simple pop music. This was also the period when the Who were one of the remnant giants from the 60's that had managed to stay afloat and keep up with technology. The resulting recording is an epic if at times difficult to comprehend opus about Jimmy the mod. The record initially had an excellent sound but one that had somewhat suffered due to transfers that were not always great, especially to CD. The soundtrack to the movie was in some aspects more focused because it had less filler; the remastering by Entwistle had had an improved bass responses, understandably, which is not the case here but the sound is exceptional: there is no more tape hiss and the dynamics have been improved a lot. The additional CD's with the demos is the main reason to buy this rather pricey thing, and not all of us can listen to the 5.1 mixes. What is very good but as usual hilarious is the essay by Pete Townshend himself where in trying to explain the concept he as usual goes off on so many tangents that it becomes completely incomprehensible. The whole thing is assize and the reproductions of the booklet are great. At this price they could have added the vinyl version but it is still  a great purchase.

0975991477|3.0|I was preparing myself for some insight and guidance but was left disappointed. As a reader of the \\"Seth\\" books reading this was rather simplistic. The author talks of spirituality but doesn't delve into its manifestations the way Seth does. Seth talks about multiple lives realities dimensions universes and a whole lot more while Lipton is giddy just to find out about a singular connected universe. Lipton may be a professor but compared to Seth he's in pre-K. Lipton's description of the subconscious is way too simplistic. He likens it to a computer loaded with programs. Seth's teachings are way more advanced. I was looking for validity from this book. To validate Seth. It comes woefully short. Seth taught us about multiple universes long before Quantum physicists did. Lipton tries to merge biology with Quantum physics. It's like giving an epic story a one line synopsis. Lipton tells us we are very much like our parents. Seth tells us we not only are like our parents but chose them before we were born as well as our parents choosing us. Everything is prearranged according to Seth. There are no accidents. Lipton believes in a cause-effect relationship mostly. Seth tells us however we have the power to change our lives at every moment. But Seth is far more complex in that a reality exists for every conceivable act we could make. Only recently have physicists postulated such an idea. Many Lives Many Masters by Brian Weiss validates Seth's teachings of multiple lives and of \\"Masters\\", teachers who help with our development such as Seth. This book may enlighten you but to be far more enlightened please read \\"Seth speaks\\" by Jane Roberts.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|We do most, if not all, of our movie watching through our AppleTV.  When I do buy a BluRay, it has to come with the Digital Download option or we're just not interested.  When I preordered Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two, I'd never heard of \\"Ultraviolet\\".  I made the mistake of assuming it worked the way, well, every other Digital Copy of a movie had ever worked for me; pop the disk in the drive, enter the code and download your movie into iTunes.  Nope.  Ultraviolet requires you to download a program from Flickster (and Adobe Air if you don't have it installed) AND create an account on the site.  Only once you've done this can you download your movie -- into their special application.  Want to open that download in iTunes and play it on your AppleTV?  Nope.  Sorry.  Not happening.  What you CAN do is submit a help request at Ultraviolet's web-site.  Give them the Redemption Code from your case and they will send you a code to download the movie from iTunes.  For me this took about ten minutes and while the customer service is good, it's completely unnecessary.  Until I learn Warner Bros. has changed how they're dealing with digital copies, I'm just going to buy directly through iTunes.  I suggest you do the same.

0385535139|3.0|I envision John Grisham tumbling out of bed and sitting down to write. He's still in his p.j.'s and nursing his first cup of coffee. He brings his formula out. HERO-young, idealistic lawyer. Check. Big bad law firm. Check. Lawyer wants to \\"really\\" happy serving deserving clients. Check. Hero rushing in to save the day. Check. Another Grisham bestseller and all before breakfast. He hasn't even broke a sweat.    I always thought Grishman was an OK writer but a very good storyteller. I used to look forward to his books. But he has done the same story so many times, it's just not interesting. In this book, he attacks the new minority that's OK to pick    on-the obese. His description of visiting an all-you-can-eat buffet was horrifying. Over and over, he makes the point that obsesity is bad. The hero and his wife make a point of never eeating fast food. The plaintiffs are not victims as they weigh over 300 pounds. On and on. We get it.    I hope Grisham gets a little fire in him and doesn't sleepwalk through another novel. This isn't it.

B002SSUQFG|5.0|I have owned the Seiko 5 Automatic watch for about two weeks now and I can not recommend this watch highly enough.  Aesthetically, the watch is beautiful.  The black face, brushed stainless steel case and comfortable nylon strap, combine to give the watch a mature and dignified yet somewhat casual appearance.  This watch can be worn with jeans and a t-shirt as easily as with a sharp, dark suit.   With the prominent minute markers on the outside of the dial, and the hour markers smaller and moved towards the center, the watch has a unique and distinctive style.  The red tip on the sweeping seconds hand is an elegant touch that adds just enough color to liven up the subdued black and white dial.  This is certainly not an oversized watch, nor is it 'too small for a man' as some have suggested.  I am a man of average height and athletic build (5'10\\", 185 lbs) and this watch fits me perfectly.  In fact, the size compliments the understated style of the watch.    As for keeping time, I am thoroughly impressed.  Over the course of the two weeks, the watch has picked up less then 5 seconds.  I consider that to be perfect time keeping ability.  The classy looks, outstanding performance, and smooth elegance of an automatic movement (all for under $80 USD), make the Seiko 5 Automatic a must-own time piece.
B005O30Y5Y|3.0|If you're considering this movie then you probably don't need a movie review from me. You've no doubt seen the other films and seen this already in the theatre. This is a god movie and sounds and looks great on bluray. I give the product 3 stars because the included \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\" (UVD) is total junk. The UVD is not like a typical \\"digital copy\\" (DC), in that you cannot download the movie and store a low-resolution copy in your itunes (or other media manager). Instead of functioning like a typical DC, you need to log onto the net and you can then stream a copy of a the movie (not download) over an active internet connection. The UVD plays back in its own player and looks and sounds poor.   If you need just a copy of the Bluray then you propably won't mind about the terrible UVD. I was dissapointed however and will steer clear of anything offering UVD.

B000002H6C|5.0|First, I'd like to start by stating that I've never been a heavy metal fan. My musical taste has always stayed with classic rock. A few months ago I decided to give into the hype, and see if I could acquire a liking for Metallica (One of the greatest metal bands of all time.) I read all the reviews that said ...And Justice For All is quintessential Metallica, so I decided to give it a try. Wow... I was, and still am, blown away. This album is excellent. Metallica give 110%. It's extremely hard for me, not being a big metal fan, to describe why I love this album so much. Maybe it's the guitar riffs, the beats, or the lyrics. It all adds up to make a must-own masterpiece. Since buying this record I've grown to love Metallica's entire catalogue. These guys have definitely earned my respect. Don't miss out like I did... Buy this album. I promise you won't be dissapointed.
B005D0TETA|3.0|Aye, I jumped at the blu-ray when I saw it was available, and like many others, I put the BD in and was loving the sound and picture; then, the animation hit...  Don't want to sound like Cream but \\"What a Bringdown.\\"  I immediately looked for the \\"stop the animation\\" option--there was none.  Like another viewer, I turned it off. I'm trying to decide to whether to keep it (for the better sound and use it for background while I'm working on the computer) or selling it because I will not put up with watching those animations.  No one can afford the amount of arrogance it's taken to \\"make us\\" watch the animations.  When I want to watch cartoons, I dial up Foghorn Leghorn.  When I want the best concert I've ever seen or heard, I go with Yes's \\"DVD\\" of Symphonic Live.  [You can bet the group, YES, all got the BDs with no animation.]
B004EPYZXK|3.0|Saw this movie last weekend. This type of movie I really do not care for however, it was better than both \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Cloverfield\\". I guess if you had to rename the movie because of the TS nature in it. You could always rename  it \\"Space Crabs\\".

B005OIAFQC|4.0|In contrast to what a lot of older fans might think (and I happen to have also purchased Praise the Fallen on compact disc back in '99), I think this is a great album.  Some of these songs could not be more beautiful, regardless of their minimalist production approach.  Yes, VNV have their cheesy, overdone moments on some albums, but their heart is what sets them apart and I feel that this album is all about stripping away the parts of their sound that do not come naturally to them to better expose that heart.  In this sense, this is the most pure VNV Nation album they have ever released.  That they have not changed their general sound much all of these years could also be taken to indicate that they are doing what they feel is best to make a living.  While I would also appreciate it if they experimented more on a few tracks, if this came out today without any of their prior releases behind them it would be easier to really praise.  Regardless, I am enjoying it without thinking too much about their past, which I never really considered as heavily groundbreaking anyway, but rather just well executed dark techno-pop.
B005DMNS4A|2.0|I was very excited to hear that Pete Townsend was remastering the original vinyl mixes for this re-release.  The original mixes haven't been available for years on CD, and the original out of print CD version was poorly mastered, leaving the MFSL Gold disc as the only way to obtain a decent copy of the original mix on CD, which is also out of print and costs $200 plus for a used copy on ebay.  This was supposed to be the definitive version, I quote from the introduction printed in the booklet that comes with this package \\"The time has come to for me and my team to honor Quadrophenia with a carefully presented package that features examples of the impact surround sound would have on the music, TO REMASTER THE VINYL MIXES, and to collect and restore my demos.\\" This was also stated in the press release info months before this release.  Based on that info I placed my pre-order over a month ago, very happy to finally have a remastered copy of the original mix.  To my dissapointment, these are not the original mixes.  I believe these are the exact mixes as the 1996 remixes.  In \\"The Dirty Jobs\\" the \\"seal\\" sounds are still missing immediately after the line \\"you men should remember how you used to fight\\", that is the most obvious way of telling this is not the original mix,  along with various guitar and piano parts that used to be louder and up front are buried in the mix, exactly like the 1996 remix.  I'm so glad I didn't spring for the Super Deluxe Edition, and waste more money.  The demo versions are interesting, but I don't see myself listening to them more than a few times.  I just want the original mixes that I grew up listening to and loving, and this isn't it.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|This review will be more about Jimmy Page's rehashing of the same ol crap folks...<br />Yes we as Led Zeppelin fans do appreciate the early Led Zeppelin \\"live\\" versions of \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" & lets not forget \\"How The West Was Won\\" & Of course the excellent DVD... But let's face it Zep fans I am tired of listening to the same songs over & over again 30 minute versions of Dazed & Confused are all wonderful but we've heard it all before not once but twice now on cd... How about releasing some later music from The Zeppelin catalogue Mr. Page for instance some live music from Physical Graffiti - how about giving the fans some live versions of \\"Kashmir\\" \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" \\"In My Time Of Dying\\" etc. stc....

B005HT400A|5.0|Movies come and go, and we tend to remember some of them. They occasionally come to mind for some reason that impacted us. Such is the case, I believe, of \\"Blue Velvet,\\" an intriguing and absorbing film that will attract you either by its weirdness - for lack of a better word --, or by Dennis Hopper's wild portrayal of a gangster, or, maybe, because of the magnetic Isabella Rossellini.  The movie starts like an old piece of Americana, in what appears to be a small town called Lumberton City, with picturesque colors and happy people, including that fireman waving his friendly hand while his fire truck is cruising the friendly streets. Suddenly, peace is disturbed when an older gentleman, who was watering the lawn in front of his house, suffers what I thought was a stroke - still don't know what it was --, and is taken to the hospital. We then meet Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who happens to be the older gentleman's son. After visiting his father at the hospital, and while walking through a short-cut at the forest to get home, he finds a severed human ear on the ground. He is immediately intrigued by it and takes it to the police, where a detective promises to investigate the issue. Jeffrey, however, is too curious for his own good, and together with Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) - the detective's daughter - tries to solve the crime. However, as you probably guessed, good old Jeff got more of what he was looking for, because in doing so, he unleashes a beast by the name of Frank Booth (marvelously played by Dennis Hooper, in a classic performance) and meets Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a gorgeous, seductive singer. These people, together, are the perfect recipe for disaster, showing Jeffrey that his little town was not so innocent after all.  With \\"Blue Velvet,\\" David Lynch, who also directed, among others, \\"Eraserhead\\" (1977), \\"The Elephant Man\\" (1980), and \\"Mulholland Drive\\" (200!), created one movie that has been described as \\"an American masterpiece.\\" You figure that one out, as the film has the recurring line, \\"It is a strange world.\\" I shall also mention that veteran actor Dean Stockwell played another weird, outstanding fellow known as \\"Ben,\\" one of Frank's buddies, who I am still trying to also figure out. This is one special movie that shall not be missed. The Blu-ray edition includes about 50 min of newly discovered footage, Mysteries of Love documentary, outtakes, original Siskel and Ebert review, and more. (USA, 1986, color, 120 min plus additional materials).  Reviewed on November 14, 2011 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Metro Goldwyn Meyer on Blu-ray.

B005HIBWFW|5.0|You can say anything you want about British director Ken Russell, whose films have been branded as edgy, controversial, flamboyant, sexuality obsessed, visionary, and much more. There is some evidence of that in some of his movies, such as \\"Women in Love\\" (1969), \\"The Devils\\" (1971), \\"Tommy\\" (1975), and \\"Altered States\\" (1980). But, whatever your thoughts are about him, his movies are truly penetrating, highly entertaining, and passionate - a tour de force, if you will. \\"The Music Lovers\\" is quite remarkable evidence of this.  The film is visually impacting at its fabulous beginning, in which we witness a happy, snowy day, when triumphant armies are returning to Moscow from somewhere, and the city is full of music and joy - a true feast for the eyes and ears. We are also immediately introduced to Peter Tchaikovsky (Richard Chamberlain), the soon-to-be famous composer and pianist. He is having fun with his male lover, Count Anton Chiluvsky (Christopher Gable), which whom he is having a hidden affair. When he is not spending time with Anton, Peter is a musician in demand, very much to the disgust and apparent envy of fellow composer Nicholas Rubinstein (Max Adrian). Peter soon catches the interest of Madame Nadedja von Meck (Izabella Telezynska), a wealthy widow, who wants to be his benefactor, providing him with money and a home. He also attracts the attention of Nina (Glenda Jackson), who slowly wins Tchaikovsky's heart, eventually getting married to him. However, this is not a good marriage, due to Peter's apparent homosexuality and incompatibility with Nina. This union is very devastating for all parties involved, including Madame von Meck.  \\"The Music Lovers\\" is a visionary partial biography of Tchaikovsky by Russell. It is just beautiful to watch, thanks to Douglas Slocombe's astonishing cinematography. And, of course, there is Tchaikovsky's music, which permeates the whole film, and, which, according to Madam von Meck, \\"reminds me that life can be rich and fullof meaning.\\" Never mind, too, the famous nude scene with Glenda Jackson, who steals almost all of her scenes - what an actress she was before becoming a politician! It has been said by some, that Russell took many liberties with the historical facts, but I believe that the main ingredients are there. \\"The Music Lovers\\" is part of MGM's Limited Edition Collection, which will be distributed by demand. (UK, 1970, color, 124 min).   Reviewed on November 14, 2011 exclusively by Eric Gonzalez for Metro Goldwyn Meyer.

B004FLKV5O|4.0|After years of reading about it. After all the reviews and opinions (both positive and negative). I decided that I could no longer ignore the gravitational pull of Wagner's epic. I am by no means an opera connoisseur. I am however a music lover. I can't imagine living my entire life without hearing the complete Ring Cycle at least once. I ended up choosing Der Ring under the direction of Daniel Barenboim for a few reasons. Quality and value were the driving force for this first-time listener. I'm not qualified to deconstruct this version versus other Ring recordings. I will simply say...I loved this widely praised Ring production. The performances and live feel of the recording are amazing. The packaging is slick. My only complaints and the reasons I didn't give this box set the 5 stars it deserves is the absence of the libretto. To solve this problem I purchased the book by Stewart Spencer which is an amazing German to English translation of the full libretto. There are 14 CDs housed in this box set. When I started importing them into my I-Tunes I discovered the disks are not consistently labeled. I found myself having to re-label most of the CDs...But these are minor quibbles. Overall this is a fantastic starting point into Wagner's musical world.

B005974CDU|3.0|I've listened to the CD 7-8 times and, while I like it mostly from top to bottom (3.5 stars actually), after I'm done listening it doesn't stay with me like many of their other (older) discs have and still do.  There's some good stuff on here to be sure with \\"Bridges In the Sky\\" probably the standout track.  The drumming is much more restrained (as others have commented).  The keys/ snythesizers are used nicely to add texture and a shine that otherwise would be lacking but they also cut down on some of the emotional aspects of some of the songs (\\"Outcry\\" I'm looking at you).  And still, as with all of their releases, they are still sticking in musical passages within songs that seem to just be there because they can be there or they want to lengthen the CD but they don't actually serve the song.  And is it too much to ask for more melody in the songs that are not ballads?  C'mon, guys.<br /><br />There's a lot to like here for both fans and non-fans.  There's a lot to like, a little to love and even drool over, and then ultimately forget.  If DT still has at least one more great album in them (and I think they do) then they need to put some feeling back into their rock songs, and not just their ballads.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I bought this case partially as a temporary case while the case I had ordered was on backorder, and partly for the screen protector. I'm no stranger to applying screen protectors, and this one was by far the easiest to apply. I think the little squeegee thing that comes in the package really reduced the amount of bubbles, and I wound up with only ONE tiny speck I can barely see. As for the case itself, it fits the phone just fine and seems to protect it pretty well. Seeing my plane white phone through the case was a little boring, so I cut out a picture the shape of the phone and stuck it in the case - problem solved. If you're looking for a plain clear case, or a way to easily customize your phone's appearance, this is a good buy. Overall, great products and great value. Thanks, amazon!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Amazon made my day yesterday with the deal of the day!!  Let me explain.  Early this year I was selling some of my DVDs in order to help pay some overdue bills.  I contacted my nephew, who is a big Firefly fan like me, and sold him my DVD set of the series for $20.  I did this because I promised myself to someday own the Blu-ray of the show.  Until yesterday, I had not yet bought it, since $60 to $80 is still a little steep for me (currently $62.99).  But yesterday Amazon ran the one day deal for $18.99 for the Blu-ray set!  I awoke to the email notification and immediately grabbed the deal.  Now I own the Blu-ray set for a dollar LESS than I sold the DVDs for!!  Ya gotta love those deals of the day!!!  FYI for the poor deprived people who don't know the show - DO NOT miss this!  It is one of the best shows EVER!!  Don't take my word for it - look at the over 3,000 5-star votes!

B005POK858|3.0|The game is as expected-an RPG. I got far enough to get a taste of it. Seems like a good time waster. The biggest flaw I see right now is that if I get a phone call while playing, it ends the game and exits me out, so that when my call ends the game returns me to my last save point. Which would be okay if I were saving every 5 minutes. An auto-save feature would be hugely helpful.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|I am a big movie lover, especially weird unknown outside the box movies so this movies hits my genre perfectly. Before I start reviewing the movie I do wanna say that I typically do not rate comedies very high. I think most comedies these days just arnt funny, maybe I am just picky, who knows.   Here are a few things that stood out to me:  ACTING:   I have never watched a comedy where the main actor (Dale - Tyler Labine) is the only actor with any jokes and the rest are just supporting roles (I dont remember ever laughing at anyone else besides dale) and it not bust. It was like the whole movie they were trying so hard to over-do Dale but it never worked, you still laughed at every word that came out of his mouth.  I really hope to see Tyler Labine in more stuff, he was just incredible in this movie.   STORY LINE:   I loved everything about the story line of this movie. Tucker and Dale just bought a new vacation home in the boonies and they accidently run into some college kids who are creeped out by T&D. It gets much worse when one of the college kids gets knocked out and T&D try to help her but the other kids think they are kidnapping her. It has a lot of twists and turns after that and the ending is great.   SUMMARY:  The whole movie is just brilliantly refreshing and I recommend it to anyone!   Thats it for mow, ill finish the review in a few days.

Anyone wanting insight into innovation could learn from this book.  As a person, the book is also a great read.  The raw expressions of passion, anger, inspiration, success and failure are inspiring.

0439023521|5.0|I put off reading this book for so long but finally gave in yesterday. The description of Hunger Games sounded too similar to Koushun Takami's Battle Royale, the book/movie I never intended to read/see. Kill or be Killed, that's the name of the game. What would you do if forced in this situation?<br /><br />I'm glad I did finally read it. It brought tears to my eyes during a few scenes. 12 districts, one girl, one boy ages 12-18 years old picked from each district every year to fight to the death. What made this so gut-wrenching is that the author Suzanne Collins makes you like a few of the tributes but you know all of them must die but one. That was so sad to me. I won't spoil it for those that haven't read it, but man, that one scene was hard to read.<br /><br />Makes you think, having to live that lifestyle, who in their right minds would ever have children. No one is safe. Being child-free, the game wouldn't apply to me, having to worry every year if my child would ever have to go in. So, in me saying this, there is one part in the book that I didn't agree with. One character doesn't want to be loved and have to reciprocate the feelings because she'll never be able to afford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. Woah, stop right there! You can have that type of love without having a child, trust me!! Anyway, just my opinion.<br /><br />This book was really great. In the process of reading Catching Fire( the next book in this series) right now.

B00111YM5G|1.0|I guess I was thinking, \\"Well, how bad could it be?\\" It exceeded my worst imagining about how bad it could be. Dialog could have been written (plagiarized more like it) by a 7th grade C English student, and perhaps was. Example: \\"We are the same, you and I.\\" Really? Pair that horrible dialog with cringingly bad acting--not everybody, but the main villan was laughable--and you have me writing a review, which I think I have done twice in fifteen years. How do movies like this get made? Isn't anybody minding the store? OK, done venting.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a revision of a previous review, written after using this cover with the Kindle Fire for a bit.   When you first see it, it doesn't look like much, and $39 seems a bit excessive. Since that time, Amazon has given credit to those who purchased it at the earlier, higher price.   The Kindle does fit snugly into the plastic case. That's a plus--it's designed perfectly. After looking at other covers, I would prefer this to other, older-style Kindle covers (soft covers that look like a book). The Fire is heavy compared to the Kindle keyboard, and you wouldn't want to drop it and have it come out of a soft cover.   The stand also works VERY well with the weight of the Kindle inside the case.    Overall, still a bit overpriced, but the new pricing makes it bearable, it's a cover designed specifically for a new product, and it's grown on me. It's not flimsy, and it fits the Fire like a glove. That took some very narrow tolerances and care in manufacturing, so that's a plus. I would give it 3 1/2 stars or so if I could, but the 4-star review is to make up for my previous 1-star review, which this cover did not deserve. I don't love it like I love my lighted, leather, 3rd-gen Kindle keyboard cover (beautifully built), but it does its job protecting your Fire without adding weight or a larger footprint. Not bad.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This isn't the movie for your typical Joe Schmo, it is very slow, very dull, little dialogue, and minimal action. Nevertheless the movie is full of power and beauty. There are moments that are incredibly grandiose and penetrate the soul if you are the emotional or philosophical type. The script contains many gems of knowledge and wisdom that I continue to look up and quote in my daily conversations. The movie gives a thorough depiction of the difference between living a carnal/naturalistic life and a life lived in the pursuit of grace. If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey then this movie is right up your ally. If you hated that flick, then refrain yourself.  The Blue ray is great, three copes, one blue ray, one dvd, and one digital copy. its well worth your time and money. Fantastic film. One for the ages.   -River R

B0059XTUMC|5.0|The Artist had quite the reputation going for it before it debuted at the Cinema Arts Festival in Houston, Texas. Early reviews were already very positive and many Houston critics were talking about how much they were anticipating getting the chance to see it. I purposely went in blind and only found out just moments before I entered the theater that it was a silent film and was not only shot in but would be presented in the now practically ancient 1.33:1 aspect ratio. A black and white silent feature film made in modern times; what's not to like about that? Truth be told, nothing can really prepare you for how extraordinary The Artist really is.<br /><br />George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the king of silent movies in Hollywood in 1927. Audiences just adore everything George is a part of. Along comes Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) who you just know is going to be a huge star some day. George and Peppy work together on one film as George not only takes her under his wing, but an undeniable spark develops between the two. Over the course of the next few years, silent movies fade into obscurity as talking pictures or \\"talkies\\" explode onto the scene. George finds himself struggling for not only work, but a purpose to live as Peppy becomes the next big thing overnight.<br /><br />The Artist is funny and charming right out the gate. Jean Dujardin really plays to the crowd and appears to love nothing more than catering to the people who come to see his films. George's dog Jack might be the biggest form of comic relief in the film. The way he plays dead and covers his head with his paws are always both presented in a way that is fresh and laugh out loud funny each and every time they're utilized. Once B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo enters the picture, the film begins to evolve into a type of romance. It's odd though because to my recollection George and Peppy never kiss. Peppy seems to steal the spotlight in the same way George does as soon as you see her dance for the first time. The laughs are there, the charms are there, The Artist has a firm grip on your heart and your attention and never really lets go.<br /><br />The film eventually begins to get a bit darker though as silent movies wither away and talking pictures take their spot. George's downward spiral is really fantastic to watch. It's mostly due to not only Dujardin's superb performance, but also the way many of these scenes are filmed. There's a scene where George is sitting down at a mirror table drinking whiskey. You see nothing but George, his reflection, and the alcohol.

The film eventually begins to get a bit darker though as silent movies wither away and talking pictures take their spot. George's downward spiral is really fantastic to watch. It's mostly due to not only Dujardin's superb performance, but also the way many of these scenes are filmed. There's a scene where George is sitting down at a mirror table drinking whiskey. You see nothing but George, his reflection, and the alcohol. He pours the booze on the tabletop as the look of disgust becomes more chiseled on his brow. That scene is so beyond amazing.

0553381695|5.0|This second book in the series \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" I find to be even more exciting and enthralling than the first (though both were very good).  The physical size of the book was larger than I had hoped to match the rest of my set (my other books from this series were 8x5\\", this one is 9.2x6.1\\"); the dimensions have been included in the product description, however I simply did not see them.  The fault is solely my own, I'm just making any other buyers aware.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|One-Line Review: I know people who sing Black Eyed Peas songs with Settlers-inspired lyrics when they get the resource cards they want.  The Settlers of Catan is the game that jump-started my interest in board games, and it completely changed my idea of what a board game could be.  With many expansions, an iPhone game bearing its name, and being carried in Barnes & Noble, Settlers may be the best known German board game.  When The Settlers of Catan burst onto the scene in 1995, it turned heads, garnered critical praise, and won the Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year); German board gaming's highest honor.  Rightly so, I might add.  In Settlers, 3-4 good friends each assume the role of a colonist who has come upon an uncharted island.  Beginning the game with two settlements each, players explore the island and lay claim to the resources it has to offer, gaining victory points along the way.  The rules of Settlers are simple.  Each island tile provides a resource: ore, clay, grain, sheep, or wood, and each tile has a number.  On your turn, you roll a pair of dice and the tile(s) whose number matches your roll produces resources.  Everyone who has a settlement or city bordering that tile gets a resource card.  Next, you can trade resources with other players or with the bank to get the resources you need (or deny other the resources they need).  Finally, you can use your resources to build.  You can build roads to explore the island and block in other players, settlements to collect more resources, cities to increase the production of your settlements, or you can buy development cards which serve to give you resources or victory points.  You gain victory points through building settlements and cities, but bonus points are also awarded to the player who has the longest continuous road and to the player who has the most Knight cards acquired from the development card deck.  The first player to reach 10 victory points wins.  I think that The Settlers of Catan is a very well-designed game.  The first thing that stands out to me is that each player is always busy.  Even when it isn't your turn, you're collecting resources, bargaining with other players, and plotting your next move.  Having little player downtime is great for keeping everyone interested and keeping the game moving.  Next is the Robber.  The Robber is a mechanic in Settlers to ensure that no one can run away with the lead.  Players may place the Robber on an island tile to prevent that tile from generating resources.  In this way, players have the power to burden the guy in the lead a little bit while they catch up.  The Robber tends to even out the playing field in a game of Settlers, and because the Robber is moved every time someone rolls 7 (or plays a Knight card), no one is ever penalized for too long.  Another shining quality of this game is its variable setup.  No game of Settlers is ever really the same because the island tiles are places randomly so your strategy has to be a little bit different each time.  At the start of the game when players choose where to place their starting settlements, you have to look to see where the most important resources are, and plan how you're going to get there  Wood and clay are in dire need at first, but as the game progresses, everyone will need ore and grain.  Choices!  The set up phase is where my games are at their most stressful; Everyone carefully eyes everyone else and hopes that the spot they want isn't taken.  Long story short, The Settlers of Catan is a great game for new and seasoned gamers alike.  While the veterans may dislike Settlers for the amount of luck present in the game, I think that this game is perfect for showing people just how fun a board game can be.

B005POK858|3.0|decent, simple final fantasy esque game. missing some of the great mechanics like in symphony of eternity tho, like how you could avoid random battles by running around the monsters.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I hope folks don't consider this a spoiler but I didn't realize that this was part of a series until I finished the book.    As other reviewers stated, I really wanted to like this book but must have truly misunderstood what it was about.  There was so much potential here with the pictures, the idea is original.  The story wrapped around them, unfortunately, was not.

1439153663|5.0|I am a retired senior citizen and this book truly went straight to my heart and soul.  I am a proud African American and my grandmother's grandmother came from Ireland to the USA in the 1850's to Virginia.  I had heard stories such as the ones in this book but to see my family's history in writing made the stories real. I am so happy to see my ancestors come alive in this book.  For those who wish for the, \\"good old days,\\" read this book and be happy to be alive in 2011 not 1811.  It was a rough read (in terms of some of the awful behavior of some characters) but the relationships were true to life.  Thank you for telling part of my family's story!  I truly appreciate the author and how she created these characters. PLEASE, get this book and you will learn a lot!
1451627289|5.0|Not horror and not science fiction but a supernatural \\"what if\\" that King does better than anybody.  I can only think that the author has fired a whole group of \\"handlers\\" in the past couple of years and is back to writing what moves him rather than what is due to fulfill a contract.  This book is not only entertaining, it's a moving love story woven into the fabric of a watershed moment that affected this whole country, especially those of us that were alive at the time.  Never have 900 pages gone so quickly and I can't believe I'm saying this but I wish the book had actually been longer.  Maybe a tiny bit slow during the time when the protagonist is staking out Oswald in the various residences but ultimately it's  necessary background.  The research into this book is incredible if you've ever read some of the actual history of the event.  This and Under the Dome mark a return of one of the great authors of our time.  Good riddance to some of the trash that's he produced in between his \\"good periods\\" and I hope it never returns.  I'd rather see King never write another book instead of putting out drivel to satisfy publishers and agents.  When he \\"feels it\\", King produces works like no one else writing today.  Is it literature?  I doubt it although several of his novels (most notably The Stand) are studied in modern literature classes in almost every college.  Does this book come close, I think so.    And to all those people giving this book a 1 rating because they think it cost too much on Kindle - get over it!  The prices are pretty clearly published and vote with your pocket book but don't downgrade the book because you're not happy with what you VOLUNTARILY paid for the book.  Frankly, I gladly paid the $17 to read it on my Kindle so I didn't get another hernia like with Under the Dome.  If you don't like the book, that's one thing but don't blame King and dissuade readers because you think it's priced too high.  Sure, I wish it was a $1.00 book but I doubt we'dsee this level of quality writing (although some have done it for a dollar).  You're always free to buy the book, put it on reserve at the library or wait for the paperback.  Or skip it all together but giving it a one rating because you don't like someone's pricing policies is spiteful and immature.
B004HO6I2E|3.0|This is the funniest film I've seen since THE HANGOVER. I didn't expect too much of the film, but when I watched it, it was laugh out loud funny. Really good job done by the cast.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Looks and feels cheap. For the premium I paid I expected better than this. My advice - wait a few days or weeks and there will be much better available and probably for less money. I'm returning mine.

B005IDXIL2|3.0|good app. really good design with good creativity. found it really interesting and easily usable. overall good app for time pass.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Up to reading 11-22-63 my favorite book from King was \\"Under the Dome\\".  Now \\"11-22-63\\" has become my all-time favorite.  This is truly a book for all, even if you are not a big fan of King.  I'm not going to go into alot of detail as many of the other reviers have but I will always remember it and will read it again in a few months.  I know some of those reading this review will think i'm some kind of nut but I don't care.  I live the books I read(around 200 per year) and this one really went to my heart.  I cried like a baby at the end and my wife was really concered when she noticed me with a handfull of kleenex.<br /><br />To those that complain abot the price maybe they should go back to comic books.  And for those that think Stephen King is a left wing Liberal I think they should get a life.<br /><br />I love my DX Kindle and the way Amazon does busines.<br /><br />Dean Bolton<br />Des Moines, Iowa
B004XKMEK2|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Ms. Lopez but this album sure has changed that. There isn't (IMO) even one bad track on the album. And 'Until It Beats No More' is one of the best things I've heard in quite some time. Yes it's Pop music from start to finish but if you like Pop than get this album and I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed. Good Stuff!
B005UG53NS|2.0|I was really hoping Harry would finally live up to the hype he was destined to be. I thought there would be a 'Neo' moment, like in the Movie the The Matrix. Where harry would become  this Super powerful wizard and he'd throw down his wand because he no longer needed it. He'd destroy all the evil wizards with ease. Someone tell me how Voldemor died at the end? What happened? Is that it? they just pointed wands at each other, and that's it? Okay. Why was Haggeret in the woods? when did he get captured? It's frustrating, there's a scene where harry is struggling to climb a pile of books and other junk to get hold of a tiara. Why doesn't he just fly? why don't they use spells, that magic cloak, or at least use their brooms. He's \\"Harry Potter\\" the chosen one. Throughout this whole collection, Harry was a mediocre wizard. Bested at all levels by Harmiany (or however you spell it), Harry is a wimp, that never became his father. Pretty disappointed. just my opinion. Reviewers say this is the best movie ever? really? I never review movies, but I needed to say something.

B005JLN9ZI|4.0|I loved the album. It had its cons and pros to it.  But i was hoping to hear something way better then \\"Thank Me Later\\". This album is good but not as good as his debut album. Even the features on Thank Me Later are Better. He had Jay-Z, The Dream, Alicia Keys, T.I., Swizz Beats, Young Jeezy. Compared to Rick Ross, Andre 3000, Stevie Wonder, The Weeknd. Which isnt bad at all, but overall the features connected way better to the songs on his last album. I still love this album never less. My favorite songs would be.  1. Headlines: It has an amazing hook and it just has a very energetic vibe that makes you love it.   2. Marvins Room: This songs just makes you think alot about your past relationships. But your better off, you just gotta make your life happen and life it to the fullest.   3. We'll Be Fine: This song just is fire, it so hott it will melt the ice cream off Guccie's face. This song is that song you have to listen to in your car and and sing it loud.   4. The Real Her: This song is just so brilliant and the chorus is heart stopping. Love it.   5. Make Me Proud: This song just simply makes you want to dance and the beat is really amazing props to noah 40.

B000002OCP|4.0|Muddy Waters-Electric Mud.  After you have done the right thing and bought a box set of Muddy Waters' traditional Blues songs, then come back here and buy this album to go with it.  This is psychedelic-funk-blues-rock done muddy waters style.  And why not?  Muddy taught us how to play electric blues and here he's joining in with the kids (of 1968) to celebrate what they have done with it, and it is indeed an album of celebration. Frankly, the album is better than even Muddy thought it was.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|I bought this version specifically so I could watch the movie on my iPod Touch.  However, the \\"digital copy\\" that is included isn't what we have all come to know as a digital copy.  You have to install a \\"Flixster app\\" which allows you to stream the movie from a server.  If you don't have the latest generation iPod touch (like me); you're out of luck. The app won't run.  If you don't have an active internet link  -- on an airplane or in an airport for instance; you're out of luck again.  If you don't have an unlimited data smart phone account; you guessed out of luck again.  What bonehead thought this Ultraviolet concept was a good idea?  Well, fool me once, I will *not* be buying any further Ultraviolet products!
B000OIL43K|2.0|The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour was a mess anyway, but this DVD does nothing to help its reputation.  This version claims to be \\"Digitally Remastered\\"...by `digitally' they must mean that someone ran a finger over the film before they copied it because the quality is very very poor.  But with all the flaws this DVD has, a decent version (as of 2011) has yet to be made available and so if you want to see \\"Fool on the hill\\", \\"I am the walrus\\" and \\"Your mother should know\\" in their full context, this is the only option available. I have it, but I wish I had waited for some better copy to come along (even if it never does).
B005C7SXMS|4.0|Equally bittersweet, melancholy, funny, and of course the nebulous and lazy word used to describe movies such as this, quirky, Submarine is ultimately quite good and touching if a bit derivative. In fact, when the film frees itself from the self-conscious \\"quirkiness\\" (again, I really dislike that term but it does fit in this case) of its first half and delves deeper into its emotional core, it improves a great deal. Written and directed by Richard Ayoade from the book by Joe Dunthorne, Submarine tells the story of Oliver Tate, a sensitive, intelligent, slightly nerdy, verbose, affected, solitary teenager dealing with his first real relationship and the possibility of his parents' marriage ending.  While not the most original premise, Submarine does manage to find its own voice eventually but still manages to wear its influences on its sleeve. The most obvious is of course Wes Anderson, right down to the nonspecific time period (the older technology seems to put the film in the 80s, but there's nothing that specifically anchors it there). The Welsh setting is used well to give the film a distinct identity, and the cinematography really showcases the beautiful landscape. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys provides original songs whose melancholy beauty matches the film's tone perfectly.  The cast is uniformly good. Craig Roberts keeps Oliver sympathetic with just the right amount of confidence, vulnerability, and charm. Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins are perfectly understated as Oliver's depressed father and conflicted mother. Paddy Considine manages to find some depth in his somewhat thankless and ridiculous role as a psychic guru. Yasmin Paige plays Oliver's aloof, somewhat inscrutable love interest Jordana. Both character and actress are a good counter-balance to Oliver. While this is Oliver's story, Jordana has well-defined motivations and is a fully developed character, not the typical poorly drawn object of affection usually seen in films like this. She's no manic pixie dream girl and how Oliver believably, although regrettably, reacts to her character's situation later in the film, along with Oliver's bond with his father, is the heart of the film.
B000RHKARY|5.0|John Mayall & the bluesbreakers Crusade is an essential album for the collector of great music.  \\"Oh, Pretty Woman\\" (which is not to be confused with the Roy Orbison hit) and \\"The Death of J.B. Lenoir\\" are key cuts in the history of blue-eyed blues.  As John himself concluded in his original liner notes, \\"I have dedicated my life to the blues...I hope you'll join forces with me.\\"
B004LL1HM4|3.0|That's the best word I can think of.  I also think the 'rave' reviews are outlandish, a sign of how starved the listening public is for artists who do their thing, not take orders from fascist producers.  Today that's a rarity.  We haven't seen this kind of musical attitude since the 1960's and 70's, an era the band strangely criticizes.  Still, as one reviewer mentioned, after hearing Fleet Foxes it's easy to reach for greats like the Beatles, CSN, Simon & Garfunkel, and Dan Fogelberg because it was them who set the example.  So for current listeners this is at least a taste of what the Music Business has forgotten for so long.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Cream - Royal Albert Hall - London May 2005.  This is THE Cream DVD to own.  The performances here are near perfection.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|Nuggets: Original artyfacts from the first psychedelic era 1965-1968.  It is exactly as the long title describes and it delivers nothing less, or more, than the title suggests.

I highly recommend it.

B0055V6EZE|5.0|I have been watching and enjoying Hugh Laurie since Jeeves and Wooster and I have been traveling to New Orleans and enjoying that city's music and culture since 1976.  This CD is such a lovely surprise to me.  To hear Mr. Laurie break out in New Orleans music and lyrics with every bit as much 'Crescent City heart' as anyone I've ever heard had me close to tears.  There are classics we've all heard and others that don't get recorded nearly as often, but are just as enjoyable.  I have listened to this CD over and over and I still have not tired of it.  I so hope he does more blues music.  New Orleans blues would be great but any blues would be fine.  The arrangements on this disc are really wonderful and the musicians are exceptional.  Of course, the addition of Dr. John, Irma Thomas, and Sir Tom Jones speak for themselves.  I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys blues or New Orleans music, period.  Fabulous!
B005MP28B2|5.0|Maybe you are trying to decide whether to invest time in this -- in that case I would suggest that you first watch \\"Days of Heaven\\" a few times.  I ignored \\"Tree of Life\\" when it came out -- because \\"New World\\" was weak, and I also belatedly realized, having sort of grown up, that \\"The Thin Red Line\\" is quite dubious too. But one day, truly bored, wanting to see basically anything, I decided to take a look. Well, I've now watched it eight times (including five days in a row), and it's absolutely glorious, my third-favorite movie ever.   It is unbelievably decadent compared to the ultra-disciplined \\"Days of Heaven\\" -- though more comprehensive, and very nearly better. Again and again Malick seems to knuckle under to his impulses. That doesn't make it much worse, though; it just means that this could never stand beside the hard, demanding masterpieces of the ages that best cultivate the mind, including \\"Days of Heaven.\\" I would compare the matter to Wagner, another artist supreme who did a lot of things he shouldn't do. Like Wagner, Malick is one of those titans of whom there are three or four per century, that you just can't understand how their minds could possibly exist, or even continue to exist once made -- accordingly, his blinding genius almost totally destroys his own shortcomings.
0446547654|2.0|Other than adding a ghost, this book follows the exact same kind of set up as his last few have, with a twisted fate ending. Come on, while this may sell, surely he can think of something else. I found it annoying once I realized that this book was following the same set up/plot with different characters and a few guns and ghost thrown in for good measure. He says in the beginning of the book that he had trouble writing this one and it was kind of obvious. It's like he got stuck and reverted to what has worked the past few times. COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW, SPARKS. Oh, and a happy (or happIER depending on your perspective) ending would be nice. His books are beginning to be like the old cliche for a country song...lost my love, lost my dog, etc etc...and it pains me to say that as I am a major Nicholas Sparks fan. Won't be if this keeps up though.
0307888681|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I'm a huge horror buff (especially when it comes to zombies!) and also a lover of history.  Tbook looks at the world before, during and after a worldwide zombie take over.  It hypothehizes (quite acturately in my opinion) about the route international relations would take.  Set as a series of interviews from across the globe, from different times, places, and people (gender, occupation, age, ethnicity, etc), Max Brooks has compiled accounts of fictional beings which a very non-fictional feel.  The only complaint I would have about this book is that I felt it dragged in some places.  I've been known to knock out books that are 700 or 800 pages long quicker than I got this one done with.  Though the interviews don't last more than a page, it does get monotoneous in parts and I've lost motivation a fews while reading, which required me to take a few days to gather more interest.  I'd lose more enthusiasm though again and again.  It was a vicious cycle.  There was something about it that made me finish though, and I'm still giving it a rating.  So if you're willing to put up with a little repetatitveness in style and content--and you're a horror fan, I'd definitely recommend.
0307891402|5.0|This book is a real page turner!  I'm only about 8 hours into the actual game, but its hard not to keep \\"peaking\\" at this book.  The hardcover is great, and the quality is excellent.  I love the black page ribbon, very classy for a video game guide book.  The bindings seem to be very durable, I noticed this after flipping through a few extra times.<br /><br />I've found myself reading the book like a novel, and not using it to actually play the game.  I do like to draw off memory things I read and try to apply them to my gaming session, but its just to addicting to wonder around Skyrim!<br /><br />...Ok back to the book.  From what I've seen so far, this thing is very well written.  The screenshots, and game photos are beautiful (not to mention 100% full color).  Its quite the task to think about playing through Skyrim and seeing and doing everything, this is even more mind boggling when you think about the time that went into writing this book!  Every detail is included, and the best part is when something \\"triggers\\", or ties into something else...the book mentions it.  This is a great help since you'll spend less time flipping pages searching for that one answer!<br /><br />One more quick note:  The interactive map alone is worth the price of admission.  Its great if you have a laptop nearby, and don't wanna delve into the story much via the book.  You can mark tons of locations and hover your mouse over the icons for a short description/location.  I found this to be very helpful when you just need to know where a certain town is, or where that rare sword can be found!<br /><br />All in all awesome book, awesome price, and an awesome game.  I'm very happy with this purchase, and have no problem giving it 5 *'s.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|If I had to sum up Take Care in one word, I would say its growth. If there's one thing that Drake has shown us since he came into the rap game, its that he is, if nothing else, consistent. He has a formula: Rap a lot, sing a little, do a hook here and there, and bam, you've got Drake's whole catalog in less that one sentence. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and in the case of Take Care, Drake seems to focus more on perfecting his formula rather than expanding it, while still showing us that he's gotten better.<br /><br />First and foremost, I was happy to see 17 tracks on here, all of which are music, no skits. That's a big plus for me. But anyway, back to the topic. Drake has never been lacking when it comes to lyrical ability, and he certainly seems to have stepped his game up on this album. With songs like \\"Under Ground Kings\\" and \\"Lord Knows\\", we see Drake really flexing those lyrical muscles. He even steps away briefly from his standard pacing and monotone flow and unleashes a flurry of rhymes at once with what seems like little breathing involved on HYFR (\\"Hell Yeah F****ng Right\\") feat. Lil Wayne. Even on the slower songs, overall, they are lyrically solid.<br /><br />While Drake does have a healthy dose of banger worthy tracks, there are a good number of slow songs on the album and may or may not sit well with the average hip hop head. One of Drake's biggest criticisms is that he flip flops between singing and rapping too much, and that he can easily slip right into R&B mode and kill whatever head nodding vibe he managed to create two song ago. While he DOES go pretty R&B mode for a bit, he keeps those songs  close together (\\"Doin It Wrong\\", and \\"The Real Her feat. Lil Wayne & Andre 3000\\",) while the rest of the songs are more of his rapping with the occasional singing on the hook. Standard Drake formula.<br /><br />A great high point of this album is easily the production. Drake has consistently shown that he has good taste in the beats that he uses, and after having heard the CD a few times now, I cant find one that I don't like. Granted, some are better then others, but overall there are no throwaway beats, and each one seems to be handcrafted to fit Drake, his style of writing, and solidifies the feel of the song. Also, while features were moderate, I think they were all well done, with a possible exception for Kendrick Lamar's part on the \\"Marvin's Room/Buried Alive Interlude\\" and Andre 3000 on \\"The Real Her\\". Kendrick himself is an awesome rapper, but his part on \\"Marvin's Room\\" just seemed out of place and weird to hear after the song had played. And 3 Stacks' addition to \\"The Real Her\\" seemed equally awkward, like his heart wasn't in it (which it probably wasn't).<br /><br />The only downside I can really say there is to Take Care is the same one that was present in Thank Me Later: content. While Drake is a phenomenal song writer, he really leaves much to be desired in the area of subject matter. The summation of all of Drake's entire catalog, including his mixtape material, is: I love this girl, I wanna f*** this girl, this girl broke my heart, I broke a lot of girl's hearts, I'm awesome and rich, I love girls. Yeah, that's pretty much the whole album right there. Now, even though I would like to see Drake branch out and write outside of his comfort zone, I do applaud the fact that he doesn't try to touch on things he knows nothing about, since that would sound stupid. His songs, while monotonous in subject matter feel honest and sincere, and if nothing else, very relate-able. Doing It Wrong is just resonating with me right now.<br /><br />As a whole, I believe that Take Care is in fact an improvement of the standard formula Drake has made for himself for constructing an album. It will by no means change the minds of nay sayers, nor will it make his fans love him any less. Its just more of the same thing that made him successful. Hopefully he will learn to expand his horizons a bit in the near future and talk about different things (he got a good start with his touching tribute to his mom on Look What You've Done\\") but I wont get my hopes up. But as long as he's putting out quality music, I'm not too bothered by it. If you like Drake, pick up a copy, its worth it.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br /><br />Lord Knows feat. Rick Ross (Awesome beat!)<br /><br />Shot For Me (Real talk for post relationship BS your going through)<br /><br />Under Ground Kings (Awesome beat, great display of lyrical ability)<br /><br />Doing It Wrong (Relationship issues you've either dealt with before, or will in the future)<br /><br />Look What You've Done (Great tribute to his mom and uncle)<br /><br />Over My Dead Body (Real chilled beat, great opening track)alk about different things (he got a good start with his touching tribute to his mom on Look What You've Done\\") but I wont get my hopes up.

0345522478|4.0|This is certainly no Harry Dresden, but still a good read. Atticus is a very interesting and unusual hero, and some of his magic is really original. Especially how he heals and why he is pretty much immortal. By far the most interesting character for me is Oberon the dog, though I wish there had been some magical reason explained for why an ordinary dog could be so brilliant and insightful (far more than most people you meet).<br /><br />Atticus is pretty much a loner, which wasn't a good thing for me as a reader. His only real friend (and she doesn't know what he is until some magical battles happen on her front lawn) is an Irish widow who is in her late 80s. I do like the scenes with the widow. She is funny. But I personally like to have more plot involving character relationships mixed into my urban fantasies. But since the main reason most people read urban fantasy is the world-building and fight scenes, and both of those are done really well, I'm giving this book 4 stars.

B005LB1MY6|4.0|Rather than writing a marathon review, I'll keep it short and sweet. AVD is NOT Cross, it shouldn't be Cross, and most of us pretty much knew it wouldn't beat the masterpiece Cross. With that being said, AVD is still a solid release that showcases Justice's talents in EDM. While the style is somewhat different from their earlier stuff, the overall motif is still most definitely Justice. If you are a fan of prog rock, you might dig this more than the average EDM junkie. Being a casual fan of prog rock myself, I did enjoy the tribute. Could it have been better? Sure. Like Daft Punk's Human After All, I'm sure people will warm up to this more once they hear it played live.  Best tracks: Horsepower, Civilization, Canon.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|After high recommendations, I watched this film with a mixture of incredulity and disappointment.  John  Wayne saved \\"True Grit\\" for me, but even the controlled, memorable performance  of John Hawkes as the rough and inscrutable yet ultimately caring brother of the daddy being sought after by the young daughter-protagonist, Ree, can't rescue this film from its own excesses.<br /><br />Normally violent scenes of mid-life hillbilly families operating as blood-related (they ARE Southern country boys and girls after all) gangbangers would be the ideal material for that narrative sub-genre known as \\"Southern Gothic,\\" especially given the potential for black humor in the grotesque climactic scene in which a couple of conscience-stricken witches of the clan take Ree on an icy, night-time fishing expedition--equipped not with tackle but a power chain-saw and  in pursuit not of big ole catfish but the submerged hands of Ree's father--the evidence she requires to save her house and family.<br /><br />In this movie, the viewer has the impression that scenes like this, along with a family's ultra-violent beating of our heroine in distress (right out of \\"The Lottery\\"), are played \\"straight\\"--the menacing characters, hurt-inflicting \\"set pieces,\\" edited face-slaps, and scary camera angles served up, along with the detailed, candid glimpses of everyday life, merely to show us the way folks conduct themselves in the Ozark backwoods where moonshine distilleries have been replaced by stolid rustics cooking methamphetamine (and driving Caddies) along with \\"Mafia-justice\\" country-style.  (Wordsworth would be appalled.)  The filmmakers appear clueless to the enormous potential of this material to show the viewer so much more.<br /><br />Other Southern storytellers--Dickey (\\"Deliverance\\"), McCarthy (\\"That Is No Country for Old Men\\"), above all, Flannery O'Connor (not to mention Welty, Williams, Capote and Faulkner)--go much MORE \\"over the top\\" than this movie.  But for them every detail is integral with, or essential to, the careful construction of an epiphany in which the reader/viewer finally is led to a shocking, indelible moment of life-changing self-recognition.  Such revelatory moments, or \\"epiphanies,\\" James Joyce insisted, are the most significant, distinguishing feature of narrative art worthy of the name.<br /><br />In response to a student's question about a seemingly exclusive preference for movies made before 1990, I could respond: In the new millennium I've seen 2 outstanding, life-changing films: \\"There Will Be Blood\\" and \\"That Is No Country for Old Men\\" (from the brothers who brought Southern Gothic black comedy to northern Minnesota comes a movie guaranteed to make you think twice before spending another precious moment in a theater).  After films like these, a viewer becomes perhaps overly astringent in his demands of a great film.  (I almost envy those who insist that a film must simply \\"entertain\\" and not present the challenges of a Blake-like visionary artist.) There are no real epiphanies offered the spectator of this formulaic, \\"True Grit meets Blood Simple,\\" pastoral aberration. In the rite-of-passage skeletal plot, even Ree's coming of age is of little interest--she's plenty tough, savvy, initiated into the business of growing up and raising a family among white-trash neighbors-on-meth from the very beginning.  Eventually, she learns to place a little more trust in the bad guys who, after all, are her kin (notwithstanding they knocked off her snitching dad, a meth cooker who was at heart a good guy too).  We, in turn, learn to stay away from movies as full of cliches, character stereotypes, and unmotivated, pointless melodrama as this one.  Or, if like the filmmakers we become enamored of the undeniable fascination of some of the more realistic, detailed vignettes of these curious country folk and the stoic but connected life they share (mostly through song), we learn that one visit is enough.al to, the careful construction of an epiphany in which the reader/viewer finally is led to a shocking, indelible moment of life-changing self-recognition.

B004LWZW88|4.0|Thankfully this prequel to the Shrek franchise, Puss in Boots, is better than the last couple of movies featuring that green ogre. It avoids all the pop culture references and introduces a brand new story with some interesting characters. The voice work from Antonio Banderas as Puss is outstanding and Zack Galifianakis fits in nicely as the voice of Humpy Dumpty. The movie is beautiful to look at and some of the jokes are really funny, but the story did lack in content. I thought a whole movie based on a sidekick character would get annoying really fast, but Puss has a way of turning a dog lover into a closeted cat person.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|The digital copy on this set has expired.  However, at the price it was at as of this writing, its still a better deal than buying the DVD and blu-ray separately, if you want to own both.  This set is the same price right now as the blu-ray alone, so its nice to have the extra dvd to be able to play in my car where we don't have blu-ray.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|Immortals is plain and simply a fun take on Greek mythology. After the Gods fail to answer his prayers, King Hyperion searches for the Epirus Bow in order to release the Titans and destroy the human race. It is up to young Theseus to become the leader he was meant to be and stop this mad King. Sure, the story is thin and the dialogue isn't groundbreaking, but man did those fight scenes deliver the goods. It basically combines elements from Clash of the Titans and 300, only with more blood and extended combat scenes where you can actually see the damage being inflicted. Due to popular demand in the comments section, the next sentence is a SPOILER. I absolutely loved the scene where the Gods came down and fought the Titans at the end. What a beautiful display of visually gory bliss. The CGI was mostly used to great effect, which was a shocker. The way Mount Olympus was portrayed was the best version I have seen, with very little cloud coverage.<br /><br />The acting from Henry Cavill (aka the new Superman) was more solid than expected, but I thought Mickey Rourke stole the show as the evil King Hyperion. He is the most ruthless and intimidating villain I've seen in recent memory. Darth Vader looks like a nice leader in comparison, because if you fail this guy, you will die in a very unpleasant manner guaranteed. At least Vader gave that dude more than one chance. Luke Evans made a very good Zeus as well.<br /><br />If you want some excellent and violent action scenes, coupled with some good performances, this is worth seeing. 2-D was good enough for me.
1451627289|5.0|It has been a long time since I sat up all night to read a book. It took me two sittings. The second was 24 hours long. This book just restored my love of Stephen King's writing. It never really disappeared but this book was just amazingly engrossing. I do think part of my immersion in the story was having the JFK assassination being my first memories. I would recommend it to anyone though.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This is a nice little tripod as long as you remember what you paid for it. It's made of plastic, so don't tighten any set screws too tight or it WILL break.<br /><br />Also, expect the camera vise to break after inserting and removing your camera about a dozen times. After mine broke, I pulled the vise all the way out so I could remove the (now useless) spring, inserted the vise back in, and then wrapped a rubber band around the top & bottom of the vise. It's now actually easier to use compared to how it was meant to be!<br /><br />It's a nice little tripod that holds your camera steady. The legs extend to seven inches and the mount adds another two inches. The bottom of the legs are smooth plastic so don't expect it to grip on a smooth surface.<br /><br />It's worth the money and gets my vote.

B005POK858|3.0|The game is an excellent throwback to the Final Fantasy games of old. However, just as the game was getting good and I encountered the first Boss battle, the game decided to reboot right in the middle of the fight. Thank goodness it made me save right before the fight. I launched the game again and again, right in the middle of the battle, my phone rebooted. I'm running on a Droid X2. Yes, it's rooted and it's running the latest Liberty ROM, but I haven't had an issue with other games.<br /><br />Overall, the game is a lot of fun and appears to be an exciting adventure to play. However, because of the rebooting, it's preventing me from being able to advance further. I'm not the only one experiencing this and it's not limited to just the Droid X2.<br /><br />Once the developer fixes the issue, the game will definitely be a keeper. Until then, I guess I'll have to back up my current progress (which isn't very far - just 15 minutes into the game), uninstall the game and wait for a patch (hopefully).<br /><br />I'm giving the game a 3 star due to the bug. Otherwise, this would be a 4, possible 5-star game.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've gone back to stock ROM and still it reboots. Hopefully this gets fixed.
B004LROUNG|4.0|John Grisham's \\"The Litigators\\" is an interesting, well-written novel that reveals many of the facets of mass tort law suits, particularly how law firms that specialize in this area and how large corporations that are often the target of such suits handle these cases. It is in the category of  what I think of as the \\"new\\" Grisham, rather than the \\"old\\" Grisham, that is it is not a legal thriller \\"The Client\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", \\"The Firm\\", \\"A Time To Kill\\", etc., but a mainstream novel about the law.<br /><br />David Zinc, a thirty-one-year-old lawyer, works for a large, prestigious Chicago firm. He puts in very long hours laboring over very boring legal issues, but he earns a very nice salary he and his wife don't have much time to spend. One day, he burns out.  He cannot make himself walk through the door to his office building.  He ends up getting drunk and, through a fluke, hooking up with Finley and Figg. Sixty-some-year-old Oscar Finley and forty-some-year-old Wally Figg are the sole partner in what they call a \\"boutique firm\\".  For the most part, they hustle injury cases. Wally dreams of finding and winning the one big case that will make him rich.  Oscar dreams of dumping his wife and having enough money to live on.  Their legal secretary/office manager Rochelle Gibson dreams of being able to move out of her  squalid apartment.<br /><br />When Wally hears about a mass tort focusing on a drug that is believed to have severe side effects, he believes he's found the big one.  He pulls the firm into the venture and joins up a famous mass tort specialist. Meanwhile, while helping with the mass tort, David finds quietly works on uncovering the manufacturer of a toy that has ruined the physical and mental health of a child and strained his family economically and physically. Grisham describes the machinations of  the pharmaceutical that is the target of the suit, the famed mass tort specialist, the clients, and the \\"boutique firm\\", as well as the impact lead poisoning has had on a family.<br /><br />Grisham's characters are colorful; Zinc is the decent man that is found in almost every Grisham legal novel, and he has avoided the simplistic \\"good guys/bad guys\\" stereotypes that have appeared in some of his work.  I do miss the excitement of those old, early thrillers, though.amily.

0439023521|5.0|Loved it! I normally do not read action adventure books let alone a series but a friend of mine suggested it. I took a chance because my friend always recommends the best books to read. Since its a trilogy I was a little worried that I was going to get bored very quickly BOY I WAS WRONG I read all three book in a matter of weeks.   I dont want to give any details away I would have to say Peeta is my favorite character I love that he is very genuine and kind hearted.  This book is amazing  I HIGHLY recommend this series you will be very satisfied! I cannot wait for the movie  to come out!

1451627289|5.0|Couldn't put this one down - SK's best since Duma Key ! And it surpasses that book by painting such an accurate picture of what life was like in the late 50s-early 60s you can practically taste the non-preservative laden food , smell the hair pomade , cigarette smoke , and exhaust from the vintage automobiles . One of King's best qualities has always been his meticulous descriptive powers and here they serve him very well relating both the good and bad of aspects of a time period with no internet or cell phones , but rather one with party lines , rotary dial phones and extremely gossipy neighbors . As with all time travel tales there is a price to pay for changing the time line and here as in other time altering stories the bigger the change the bigger the ripple effect . And as an unexpected bonus there is a small part where Jake Epping encounters characters from a previous King novel - really loved that part since it was from one of my all time favorite SK books ! I'll never forget when as a 6 year old in first grade the school principal interrupted the class with the news of the president getting shot - it was an event that literally stunned a nation . In the years since there have been many 'what if' stories of the president not getting assassinated , but I'd have to say this one is much more than that and the best of the genre . Mark me down as a very satisfied constant reader !

B005D0RDKW|5.0|It was with mixed feelings that I awaited the delivery of my Blu-Ray of Time Machine 2011: Live In Cleveland.  I had purchased the CD/MP3's from Napster the day it came out and was a bit underwhelmed.  Geddy's vocals were a bit lacking and I thought that age had begun to caught up with him.  I thought the CD was a fine momento for those who actually went to the show and little more.  I had seen this show at the end of the first leg, and I thought the performance in West Palm Beach was better than what I was listening to on my I-pod.  I gave that CD three stars basically saying that those who wanted a souvenir of the tour, it was worth the cash, but on it's own merits, there was better live versions of most of the songs out there.  I still stand by that review.  Many others as well reviewed the CD similarly so I know I'm not alone in that thought.  My Blu-Ray arrived a week later.  Ok, I thought, you know what it sounds like, but at least you'll like the visuals.  My expectations were definitely lowered.  I was blown away.  Don't get me wrong, this is the exact same tracks that are on the CD's.  There are a few seconds of dialog missing from the CD and the CD is broken up between Limelight and Camera Eye, whereas the Blu-ray keeps the intermission intact.  I certainly can hear some of the same weaknesses that I heard on the CD.  Time Stand Still has some cringe inducing moments.  But for some reason, maybe it's the DTS surround mix, Maybe it's watching them play as well as listening to the content, but for whatever reason, Geddy's vocal weaknesses are not as apparant in the Blu-Ray as they are in the CD.    I am not an audiophile by any means, so I can't really critique the \\"mix\\" or any other aspects others here may be able to critique more effectively.   As a Rush fan, I simply love this Blu-Ray.  I have both Rush in Rio and Snakes and Arrows Live on DVD.  Rush in Rio is a great concert video but the camera shots are too short and don't seem to linger on the band long enough and seem almost random in their cut aways.  Snakes and Arrows Live is a much better show.  It's looks and sounds much better, though the crowd in Holland can't compare to 40,000 brazillians, however the Snakes and Arrows Setlist is not one of my favorites.  The Time Machine tour show is simply amazing.  The concert is filmed brilliantly and the shots are logically situated, focusing on a band member at the appropriate time.  Whether it's Neil doing a fill-in, Alex doing a solo on the Mandolin, or Geddy performing a bridge on the synth, the camera tracks whatever band member is dominant at the time.  Overall, his Blu-Ray provides a completely different experience than the CD.  I'll continue to listen to the CD as it is a portable version of this fine show.  But as far as an over all experience this Blu-Ray just blows the CD and most other Rush Concerts I've seen filmed out of the water.  So much so, that I barely notice that Geddy is not at his prime vocally.  Musically, the band here is in top form.  If you went to this show then you'll want to pick up both the CD and the Blu-Ray/DVD as you'll want a portable version of this show to listen to in the concert, or while working out, or wherever you are.  However if you only want to buy one version of this show, then this Blu-Ray is the only way to go.  It is amazing.  And finally, if you already purchased the CD and were somehow disappointed, then I suggest you buy the video.  It's hard to figure out but it's on a magnitude better than than the audio only version.  Someone tell me I'm wrong.  I just can't believe that I'm listening to the same performance.  And yet there it is, the Blu-Ray/DVD blows the CD out of the water and I have no idea why.  A definite must have!!!!
B004M9AS3Y|5.0|I ordered this bag because I wanted to reduce the amount of bags that I carried with me. I had a bag for my laptop and I also had a bag for my camera. It was always hard to get my camera out of my bag because I thought I would drop my other lenses. However, with his bag it took me just seconds to take my camera out.If your not going to take your camera then you can always remove your camera department and add more  space for textbooks or notebooks and other accessories. Also you can add a 15.5 inch laptop however for some computer's, such as my Dell Studio 1555 you kinda have to force your laptop in. And if you have a 9 cell battery you gotta remove the battery because it wont fit in the laptop compartment with your laptop.  Pros:  Light  Well designed  Awesome space for everything  Great protection for everything inside the bag  Customization compartments  Cons:  Wished it had a slightly bigger laptop compartment.
B000RIWAVW|1.0|okay I like a lot of Movies but this Movie Halloween, along with The Human Centipede are the worst ones ever made. This film was made in 1978 and I thought it would be a nice scary film with plenty of scares and gore boy was i wrong. I rented this movie to see if it was worth a buy no not worth it to me comeon Michael Myers scary no way. He looks like some weirdo who wears a plastic mask.The acting in this film blew the charecters were eh and I am like this film is no good.I wont buy this film cause it is a bomb and not in a good way. If you want to see a scary movie with a scarier killer in it watch A Nightmare on Elm Street with Freddy Kreuger in it or the Friday the 13th films with Jason Voorhees in it.I mean The Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie from 1974 was way better then this pile of utter trash the only thing i liked about this film was when it ended. i give this lousy film 1 star if i could give it 0 stars I would so not worth it. THis looks like a PG13 film other then the nudity of course. This film isnt scary doesn't give Horror movie lovers like me the gore and the scares that we want the only thing this film has going for it is the nude scene with the woman. Thats not saying much. This film is way way overrated for those people that gave this film 3 stars and up must not like gory horror films with a good story o well to each his or her own I suppose.

B005OGYHB8|5.0|This live disc proves once again, Slash is the guitar god, but he is also responsible for the writing credit of some of the best rock songs ever penned. This compilation is not too different than the ones recorded and offered for sale at his shows last year on tour with Myles Kennedy, but Made in Stoke is a bit longer and more diverse. It's good to see Snakepit songs on here too; he ought to do a part II Re-Made in LA and include some more Snakepit songs. There are some lost gems on those two albums and with Myles singing they can bring the best out on of them. Night Train, Ghost, and Mean Bone are quite a way to get started, and ending with \\"Paradise City\\" is like being at an old GNR concert. Myles is such a great vocalist and he sings those GNR songs superior to any version ever heard live (Civil War, Mr. Brownstone, and Sweet Chid). The opening to \\"Slither\\" is awesome and \\"Watch This\\" is a great showcase of both guitar and band. Made in Stoke is one of the best live albums I've ever heard. I look forward to the next studio album. They're doing great things and making RNR.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Note: I also wrote this on iTunes so don't think I stole it or anything, LOL!<br /><br />Adeles don't come around every day you know. She is a force to be reckoned with right now in the music industry being a great singer, a very solid songwriter and having knowledge on playing a few instruments herself. Right now in late 2011 everyone is rightfully raving about her new album that has brilliantly sold 10 million copies worldwide IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR!!! Flat out astounding if I do say so myself. Back in 2005, most people considered Mariah's \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" her comeback album (it is great, BTW) but it took YEARS to get those same sales. Must I say again that Adele did it in less than a YEAR??! 2005 was even a much better time for music than it is now in our stagnant times for quality music and poor sales for even seasoned verterans.<br /><br />But now let's talk about the album itself. All in all, to shortly describe the record would be to say it's minimally produced with bits of tinkering going on to make it just fancy enough. But the package is made complete with solid songwriting and the gorgeous, R&B-tinged vocals Adele hosts. Some songs are acoustically done, some are R&B-flavored and soulful and others are just offbeat.<br /><br />\\"Right As Rain\\" which pulls all the right stops is by far my favorite (let the song build and then listen to the end vocal work) but other excellent tracks are \\"Melt My Heart To Stone\\", \\"Daydreamer\\" and \\"Best For Last\\". All the tracks are in some way good but \\"My Same\\" being the odd man out is slightly average because of the vocal arrangement although I get the sentiment of the lyrics.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />DOWNLOAD:<br />\\"Right As Rain\\"<br />\\"Best For Last\\"<br />\\"Hometown Glory\\"<br />\\"Daydreamer\\" &<br />\\"Tired\\"

I did everything possible to verrify the reason this dvd doesn't play and notice that something is wrong. Now i lost all my investment.
B0055Q5F36|3.0|Applying the case is simple enough. It adds minimal size to the phone and decent protection. The screen protector that comes with it has much to be desired. It took me a little while to get it on with and still look good. I've used much easier screen protectors. The black silicon inner case is a rather soft material that gathers dust very easily. I'm always having to clean my case. Finding a belt clip carrier isn't easy either since with the otter box on it makes the Galaxy S2 into one large phone. Protection wise, excellent. Well thought out and while it's not a Defender series case, your phone had good protection that doesn't look like an iphone hockey puck. I bug my co-workers that they have an ipuck.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am a little surprised by the reviews. When I read them yesterday, I was ready to return my case when it arrived today.<br /><br />I bought this because I wanted the lightest case possible that would provide protection. It is very light. As the product description explains, the case is polycarbonate (an impact and scratch resistant PLASTIC) which has been rubberized on the outside, and the cover is a soft fabric (rubberized with a felt layer on the inside. Yes, the elastic strap is glued, but so what? Glue is a good thing.<br /><br />It feels \\"cheap\\" because it is very light (so light I thought the package was empty). According to my postage scale, it weighs a tad over 3 ozs. The stand does not stay in place unless it is weighted with, of all things, a Kindle Fire inserted into it. Then it works perfectly.<br /><br />It is exactly as advertised: a very light, form-fitting case that offers good protection for the device with a simple display stand. Nothing fancy. Certainly doesn't have a designer name. But, it does what it is intended for and I am very happy with it. Obviously, I can't comment on durability, but the materials seem of high quality and the finish is excellent.<br /><br />UPDATE 20 Nov 11:<br /><br />It is time for an update because I have been using the case for almost a week of intensive enjoyment of the Kindle Fire. It is really an outstanding case! If you are looking for a good balance between weight and protection, I can't imagine there is a better choice. I will address myself to a few issues based on use:<br /><br />1. The stand function is very simple. You insert the leading edge of the folded cover into a slot on the back. This has worked well for me, although I notice a number of reviewers have commented that it doesn't work well for them. I am not sure about the discrepancy, but it may be related to the hinge stiffness. I noticed that it is more stable as the hinge side (on which the device rests when in the stand position) softens with use. It is rather stiff at first. If you massage it a while it becomes more pliable and flattens, which improves stability. As for falling out of the slot, I haven't experienced that problem.<br /><br />2. The quality of materials seems to be excellent. \\"Light\\" means \\"cheap\\" to some people. But this seems to be made of high quality polycarbonate and rubberized fabric. I haven't noticed any degradation of the materials. The case is very well constructed, including the elastic strap, which is heat sealed to the case body. I tried to pry it off, and it is really bonded well to the case body. BTW, the space between the case and the Fire is a great place to store a microfiber screen cleaning cloth, which you will need.<br /><br />3. It is light and the Fire is heavy (especially if you are used to the Kindle e-reader). Any weight savings should be appreciated and this case delivers. Did I mention it is light?<br /><br />I would buy this case without hesitation, but everyone has different needs. My objective was to find the lightest case possible that was made of high quality materials and which would provide sufficient protection in case I dropped it (I seem to drop things a lot). This case meets my needs as well as I could expect. At the new lower price of $29.95, I think it is well-priced for protecting a $200 investment.<br /><br />UPDATE 29 Dec 11:<br /><br />I carry my Fire everywhere, everyday in my coat pocket and recently returned from a two week trip to Europe and Africa, where it got bounced around a lot. The case is in great shape. There is some scratching of the outer hard case, but just minor. Most importantly, I have dropped my Fire many times and this case has provided absolutely rock-solid protection. I would have thought that the front cover might fray at the edges or the flexible hinge might become worn. But it is still just like new. The only difference is that the case has become a lot more stable in the viewing position as the cover has become more flexible on the hinge edge. I stand by my original review even more positively.
0553801473|2.0|I loved the first 3 books.  The fourth was a little slower paced, but I still enjoyed it.  I had a hard time finishing this one.  It was just too slow.  Books 4 & 5 combined would have made a decent 500 page book.  I am done with this series.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I got this as a replacement for the retail heatsink that never seemed to click in completely (hate those plastic snap in parts).  The metal back plate was exactly what I was looking for, taking out the motherboard to install the cooler was not an inconvenience at all   for me.  The cooler installed with no clearance issues at all on my an Asus P5K motherboard with an Intel core 2 quad Q8400   with a Rosewill R5717-P BK Mid Tower case.  OC'd to 3.3GHz using retail heatsink  Core temps running prime 95's torture test were 67+ degrees C on the stock cooler with errors within a minute on core 0.

0553386794|5.0|I loved this book as well as the next 2 in the series.  It is well written and unpredictable.  If you decide to read the series, keep in mind that after book 3, it goes downhill fast.  You might want to read the reviews for A Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons before you start.
B005GVW05Q|2.0|And YES I've listened to it  about half dozen times now.  One reviewer below said it best:  DULL. i'll add:  totally forgetable.

0316098329|4.0|Don't we all have that sick little Anne Frank fantasy where we wonder how we'd spend our time hidden away somewhere? How would we deal with all those hours of isolation? Would our spirits bounce, like Anne's, or would we succumb? In Emma Donoghue's ROOM, we meet Jack, our five-year old narrator who is locked away in Room with his Ma. The story as told through Jack's perspective naturally has a child-like naivety to it, but what's more eerie is that Jack was born in ROOM and has never left it. He doesn't know there is a real world beyond the door. His mother is wonderful, we learn that right off the bat. She has scraped together a complex and rich world for Jack in his small space and she has guarded him against realities she has no way to explain to him. What begins as a claustrophobic premise quickly turns into a complex study of what the human mind is capable of doing--both the good and the bad. The Ma of this book might be the strongest character I've ever encountered, even though she is a captive. Jack and Ma have spirits that bounce, but not at all in the ways you'd suspect.<br /><br />This is a thriller, a page-turner, a mind %&()@. It's a difficult read, as the crimes committed against them are hard to hear. But it's also a fascinating study in style. Jack isn't a babyish 5--he's mature and smart and observant but still convincing as a child.
B0059M7ZVG|3.0|They have an interesting formula.  Which can get boring.  I do like the music.  Lyrically I don't care for it, it feels contrived.  Just my opinion, I can see how some people would like it.
0525423281|3.0|Story:  Lola, who lives for fashion and costume, is (almost) completely satisfied with her life. She's happily together with her rocker boyfriend Max and except for a little too much interference from her two dads, things couldn't be better. But then the dreaded twins Calliope and Cricket move back in next door and and things are starting to get complicated.  Because maybe she isn't really over geeky, but suddenly much more mature Cricket and if there's a person she never wanted to meet again, that's his \\"evil\\" twin sister Calliope.  ***  Even though my review might sound a bit bad, I want you to keep an open mind, because it isn't uncommon that my opinion sometimes \\"stands out from the crowd\\". I WOULD recommend this book because it definitely had its good points as well.  So here's the thing. If I read the book without reading \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" first, I might have given \\"Lola\\" four stars, but now that's just not possible. I had so many expectations for this book and ended up pretty disappointed when I finished it.  First of all the love triangle between Lola, Max and Cricket didn't work for me at all, it completely overshadowed the whole plot and the progress was painful. And I'm not talking about the bittersweet kind.  I'm no big fan of love triangles, actually I could pretty much do without them (with a few exceptions), but this one was especially bad. The reason for that is Lola. The way she handled the whole thing was just wrong and I wasn't at all suprised that everyone ended up hurt somewhere along the way (but take note that there is a Happy End!).  So you can pretty much guess that Lola wasn't my favorite character. I did love her parents though, her two dads were just great even if they did interfere a little too much in her relationship with Max (but since they were right in the end, it's kind of hard to blame them).  The things that did save the book where Cricket, as well as Anna and St. Clair. Those two did get quite a few appearances. They are just as great as they used to be and the way their relationship improved and deepened was almost palpable. I really, really loved those scenes. St. Clair is just so delicious! :]  Then there's Cricket. Sweet, geeky, but curiously attractive Cricket. He didn't stand a chance against St. Clair, but compared to a lot of other YA-protagonists he was really great.  Unfortunately he didn't get nearly enough \\"page-time\\". In \\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" Anna and St. Clair were together pretty much 24/7 and I loved that. In \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\" sadly that wasn't the case. With Cricket away in College, he was at home (and next to Lola) only in the weekends and as a reader I missed him constantly. I also would have wished for additional and more detailed flashbacks. You'll know what I mean if you read the book (and yeah I know that I'm repeating myself, but I would really suggest that everyone who likes YA-romances should read it).  ***  So in the end you could say, that I did like \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\", even though it turned out to be a bit too melodramatic for my taste. The love triangle dragged on too long and cost the book at least one star.  But still, the scenes between Cricket and Lola did turn out really, really sweet and I loved them when they were alone together.  So read the book and form your own opinion!
1410430103|3.0|I just read \\"Killing Floor\\", having never read anything by this author before. I was VERY annoyed by his incredible overuse of \\"shrugged\\" in this novel...let's hope someone pointed that out to the author and that he resolved this awful verbal tick in the later installations. Where the heck was his editor on this? If a man really shrugged that often, I'd suggest Botox injections for his shoulders!  I also think he should have had a native American English speaker vet this book before sending it to press, as \\"straitaway\\" is a British expression and takes away from the character. I suppose he perhaps can justify that by saying Reacher was raised all over the world, but I would argue that Child tried very hard to find an American voice for this character -- mostly succeeded.   Another annoying point: I didn't want Roscoe to \\"smile tenderly\\" one more time or I was going to give up. She hardly knows Reacher...where does all that tenderness come from?  Other than those aspects, the plot was engaging enough, though the bad guys were cardboard cutouts, cliched and flat. Sometimes Reacher's deductive abilities were ludicrous (he not only knows WHAT pseudonyms a guy would have used, but in what precise order and exactly where this guy would go...).  I hope the rest in the series are better written, given their popularity. Don't know if I would bother to read another.
B001GM28HO|5.0|This is a great album, one of the best I've bought recently! Very good songs, superb interpretationby this young artist. Highly recommended.
0345529057|5.0|These books are amazing, the paperback edition that I bought is perfect to take it with you and read it in any place. I have just started the first book and it has trapped me. I seriously recommend to buy this edition if you want to start reading this saga and don't want to spend too much money buying the hardcover editions.
B000002MUW|2.0|As an album, Bedtime Stories is insipid, uninspired, boring and a tedious aural exercise. I know the intention is to do some ballads, but Madge seems to drag her feet vocally and comes across as lackadaisical.  Some tracks are pretty tuneless, think Love Tried To Welcome Me and Sanctuary. The album could do with some rigorous editing to whittle down the set to the really catchy ones. And release this as an EP.  Two stars for the hits - Secret and Take A Bow. The latter produced by Whats-His-Face.  If you do not own this, you may just want to get Celebration which contains these songs.  Looking at the brighter side, Bedtime Stories is a great cure for insomnia!

B000TCEU4Q|4.0|I'm quickly becoming a Saitek fan.  This throttle quadrant is a wonderful addition to my flight sim gear.  I use this for Rise of flight and combined with my joystick I have enough sliders to manage all my planes engine controls.  The buttons on the bottom work great.  The indicators on it are easy enough to read and determining where the controls are positioned is easy to do with out even looking at the device.   Durability wise, this thing has stood up to my use as well as my 15 month of son's abuse and still ticks well.   My only complaint, and its minor is that at the start of every mission in Rise of flight, I have to cycle the controls up and down fully for the game to know the position properly, then it just works.    For the price, this is a wonderful addition to any simmers gear.
B003W5C0VC|4.0|Did you like Silence of the lambs, you must have this to add to the story.  No spoiler here, just a good thriller.  \\"It puts the blu-ray in the basket \\"
B000001GK9|4.0|Given the legend-in-its-own-time status of this \\"Karajan Gold\\" CD, it's easy to bring excessive expectations to it.  Certainly the recording sounds beautiful; extraneous live-performance noise (coughs, page turns) is virtually nonexistent, and in loud passages especially, the BPO's playing is glorious.  The last movement is made to order for the kind of long-breathed, sustained intensity that Karajan could get from his strings, and anyone who knows his Verklarte Nacht won't be disappointed here.  Yet at the finale's climax, the descending fortissimo violin notes seemed stretched out too far, especially when the violin-and-horn main theme then reverts to a faster tempo instead of maintaining a majestic slowness; for me, this actually broke the intensity and intruded a \\"mine is longer than yours\\" showoffishness.<br /><br />But my real concern with this recording is the extreme contrast between the softest and loudest passages, a well-known predilection of Karajan's and one that I generally welcome.  In a concert hall, the loudness level is limited only by how far the players can go without degrading their tone quality, and in your own house (or on a desert island), the only maximum is what your speakers can manage without clipping.  But if you live in a NYC apartment, as I do, you can play your CDs as loud as you'd like -- or as the producers may have intended -- only if the neighbors don't complain.  With this Mahler 9th, it was impossible to find a middle-ground volume; either the very soft passages sank into inaudibility, or the fortissimos erupted to lease-breaking power.  Sitting with your finger nervously on the volume control of your remote, making repeated adjustments up and down, is hardly the way to become involved in a Mahler symphony, however good the performance may be.

0547581033|3.0|We already have the first board book version of this title, and wanted to buy another to send to a friend. I thought I was buying the same board book, but this is huge and heavy! Like a brick! I have no idea why the publisher would release a board book (that should be easy for a baby to hold) in this size. If my 23 month old dropped it on her foot, we might need to take a trip to the ER.  Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this huge board book version. Search other retailers for the smaller board book of this title. The story is darling (I give the story and illustrations 5 stars) and the smaller book is well loved by my little girl. It will cost a bomb in shipping to return this giant book, so we will be donating it to charity.
B000002GBK|5.0|Myths & Legends of King Arthur & the Knights of the Round Table is not only a long album title to actually type out (so I'll be shortening it for now on)... it's also an awesome experience.    Going into this right after Journey to the Center of the Earth, well, there's probably not *that* big of a difference between the two albums.  The biggest difference I suppose is that this album places more emphasis on vocal melodies, and especially pop vocal melodies that seem to indicate a desire to attempt commercial success.  The production techniques sound almost exactly like the Alan Parsons Project (which isn't a BAD thing of course, the APP are quite amazing in their own way as well).  The intricate arrangements and the pop-like vocal melodies make me think a comparison to classic Renaissance is totally fine.  I wouldn't be surprised if the two artists used to tour together since they both had popular success around the same point in the mid 70's.  A song by the name of \\"Sir Galahad\\" is actually a perfect Argent imitation.  You know, the band that did \\"Hold Your Head Up\\" and sooooo much more (*hint hint* check out their Encore live album!  It's awesome!).    The highlight is probably \\"Merlin the Magician\\".  The song title alone takes me back to my more innocent days and to my favorite animated childrens film the Sword in the Stone (I used to be OBSESSED with that movie to the point I'd watch it every single day... ah, the memories of being 7 years old again) however that's not to say this song is childish in any way.  No way!!  Any child that admires a song like this surely has to be at the top of his class anyway because it's all about really beautiful arrangements.  There's one part about this 8-minute display of instrumental chops... actually 3 parts, that stands out to me the most.  It's whenever that GORGEOUS piano melody comes back after a more chaotic portion.  Ahhh, I love that part.  So soothing and gentle.  The way Wakeman continues to bring it back in a waythat feels totally natural is true talent.  \\"The Last Battle\\" is all about displaying a really bombastic vocal melody while the other arrangements take a back seat.  I enjoy it however at first my impression was that Wakeman could have written a better melody.  You might have the same initial impression as me, be warned.  At over 9 minutes, this song quite honestly SHOULD be the highlight, but because so much of it centers around those vocals (and a pretty awesome synth jam too!) it's not the best song for me, I'm afraid.  Still, it grew on me after 4 listens, and perhaps it still is.    Other moments such as \\"Arthur\\" is another vocal melody-driven song with piano and other instruments not really coming into the forefront like they do on most of the album, and my oh my does THAT vocal melody sound exactly like classic Kansas or what?  It's a good one too.  \\"Guinevere\\" is a soulful ballad of sorts... sort of a surprising move, I'd have to believe.  Wasn't expecting it at all.  Good enough melody but indicative of the mid 70's when the music scene was being flooded with this type of music.  Oh, there's also some familiar chanting that comes and goes as the album rolls along, usually featured in the beginning and end of each track.  I'm not too crazy about this idea because the notes feel undeveloped and repetitive, but, on a positive note, it *does* make the music more majestic.    Overall, slightly worse than the previous two Rick Wakeman albums, but not by much hence the 5-star rating I believe it deserves.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I saw this performance in the theater and it was beyond words.  What I want to know is Nov 14th this was released in Region 2 and is listed online for $29.99 as the same \\"Triple Play\\" - DVD, Blu-Ray and Digital copy.  But this page doesn't list the product like this.
B00003CXDV|5.0|What a cool little movie!  Galaxy Quest is \\"Star Trek\\" and all that entails from the back end; it takes a skeptical look at the morass of fandom that Star Trek evolved into, and puts a skewered (yet funny) face on it.  When the cast of a sputtered-out sci-fi series take to the fan-boy circuit to perpetuate the TV dream, they are approached by genuine e.t.s' to assist them in helping save their planet.  They gradually realize that they have the 'stuff' to assist them, but the funny stuff happens as they arrive at that conclusion.  Well worth watching!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I downloaded PvZ quite some time ago (I think it was the first game the Amazon App Store offered for free) and have been waiting to play it for a looong time now. I had an HTC Hero, but PvZ wouldn't run on the phone, so the app sat in my digital locker, collecting dust. I just upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch, though and was finally able to download and run the game!<br /><br />I really like PvZ, but unfortunately, on my SGSIIE4GT, there is a problem with the game crashing for no apparent reason. Often times, the program will simply shut off just before the end of a level, which can be very frustrating (as you might imagine.)<br /><br />Even with the crash issue, the game is still worth the $2.99 - just don't become heavily invested in the level you're playing...<br /><br />EDIT: 11/23/11 - I had originally titled this review \\"Fun game, sometimes crashes on the SGSIIE4GT\\" but have since changed \\"sometimes\\" to \\"always\\". I also reduced the game by one star. At the last zombie on level 2-9, the game just shuts off and goes to the phone's home screen. I'll restart from level 1-1 eventually and see if it is a problem that always occurs, or if it is random and just happened to affect me at that point in the game.
B0056FMNYA|5.0|Hello Everyone,<br />2 years ago I started a search/research for a camera holster. Something that would be easy to use, safe while also considering my active life style such as remote travel, hiking and biking. I did not care to look like a SWAT team member, I don't like anything hanging around my neck and I did not care for 4K set up bouncing around my waist. So when I found the B Grip I was sold on it and bought 2 of them and additional plates, the plates also fit very nice on my Manfrotto head. The product has performed very well with out any issues. But one item to note, you must every so often clean the rubber plate with alcohol, it will improve the already strong grip.<br /><br />3 week ago after another short research of what is out there I bought the newest versions of the B Grip, another good design, they added more safety items to the already safe design. So far the performance is 100%. Anyone looking for camera holster should try this one, you can use it blind folded, no joke! I use 2 othem<br />in my studio.<br /><br />I did look at another new interesting mechanical holster, very sim to Spider but I think most ratings came from investors so decided not to purchase at this time.<br /><br />UP DATE 2/20/13<br />Hawaii, Florida, Alaska, Belize and 6 pro events. Still gets 5*<br /><br />Good luck!

B005D9B26E|3.0|Here we have the super deluxe treatment of The Who's \\"third and final masterpiece\\"...... 1973's Quadrophenia. Pete Townshend has always considered the three studio albums: Tommy (1969), Who's Next (1971) and Quadrophenia (1973) as the band's creative pinnacle in their history.   I've had several people tell me during the last two days that Townshend's comments made a couple months ago that several original 8 track and 16 track masters to Quadrophenia have gone missing \\"\\"are simply not true\\"\\". The corrected story I'm getting now is that Pete's team simply stopped putting a lot of priority into mixing any further Quadrophenia tracks into 5.1 surround sound. If this is indeed true, it's a major screw-up strategy by Townshend and his team. Anyone that's going to pay whopping $140 for a Quadrophenia box set is going to insist on the ENTIRE album presented in a 5.1 mix. I'll bet this will be addresed soon.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|I was scared that her 2nd album wouldn't live up to her first album, but dare I say that this album is even better. Heavy drum beats are softened by the whimsical notes of the harp and slowly lure you into a trance. How could I expected anything less than greatness from Florence + The Machine????? I've been listening to this album non-stop since it was released, and I'm still not tired of it. In my opinion, there isn't one bad song on here. This is easily one of my favorite albums of all-time, and I doubt that will change anytime soon!

0743554434|5.0|Written by a talented author who was born and raised in Kabul, Afghanistan, we (the readers) are privileged to peek at the lives of women living their lives in a war-torn, survival-mode country where women are controlled and degraded by religious extremists and weak, powerless men.  Hosseini accurately portrays the victimization of women under the Taliban whether they be of privileged birth or the lowest class.  The brutality of Afghans toward each other in the effort to fight, like dogs, over the remnants of their country is demonstrated also.  The clear message of ignorance breeding more ignorance is clearly evident as well.    As the war continues to rage in Afghanistan, and thousands of innocent children and women are caught in the unintended crossfire, it is a most valuable read for every American to understand the dynamics of the country, and the continuing victimization of the most vulnerable citizens!

Warner Brothers makes you sign up for their Flixster service then their Ultra Violet service and you get in an ugly loop but never get to the stage to enter the redemption code to get the digital download.[[ASIN:B005O30Y5Y Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]]
B0002LMLSQ|4.0|I discovered the talent of Ludovica Einaudi about 2 months ago, and became mesmerized by his piano playing.  I'm not much into piano music in general, however, when I heard his piano playing, I became captivated, and decided I must have his music.  I've listened to it over and over, and I never get tired of it.  There's something almost ethereal behind his piano playing, unlike I've ever heard before in other piano classical music.  His music is definitely worth your time to check into, you will not be disappointed.

B005D0RDIE|4.0|I've seen Rush many times over the years and they have never disappointed. This video is no exception.Probably my favorite setlist of all time. Throw in Xanadu and The R30 overture and I'd be in heaven. I'm being greedy. The only problem I'm having with this DVD, and maybe it's just me. I can't get the audio to play if I select 5.1 in setup.It will only play in dolby 2.0. Any other Rush DVD I have will play in 5.1 if chosen on any DVD player in the house. Took my 1st copy back to Best Buy and got another with the same results. Any help or comments would be appreciated.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|I know I'm late in getting this movie, but it was offered as a special deal with Thor BD. Iron Man is great! Has everything going for it. Humor, special effects, good acting, good story line, everything you could want. Looked and sounded great on my modest home entertain equipment.   Also, it has the two things a movie like this needs the most...it's fun and entertaining! You can just sit back and enjoy...don't have to worry about \\"hidden\\" meanings or trying to figure everything out...It's all right there for you to just enjoy!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|IMO, another hit by Marvel. I'm a bit bias because The Mighty Thor was always my favor comic book. I love Thor and his story lines. I also like that his comics were written with him speaking like a Norseman of old...It was different and set him apart from other Super Heroes.   My 2 biggest worries were how Marvel would make Thor sound, and could they produce special effects that were worthy of the Might Thor. I believe they succeeded in both areas. Chris Hemsworth has not only the physique to play Thor, he had the voice...his accent gives that added touch to Thor. Marvel also succeeded in the special effects at reproducing what we have seen Thor doing in comics and on his short lived cartoon program. Scenes like him spinning his hammer while hovering up in the air looked so real (in the real of the movie).   Lastly, on the BD the 7.1 sound is fantastic! And of course PQ is nothing less than great!  I highly recommend this BD for any who was a Marvel Super Hero fan as a kid, and still is.  Let's just hope Marvel keeps turning movies with the same top quality as Thor and Iron Man.

B005PW3OS8|3.0|This movie is faithful to the comic book, including the ridiculously juvenile story. That's good if you are aged 7-15. Not so good if you are looking for an adult version of Captain America.<br /><br />Captain America's nemsis, the Red Skull, has possibly the worst and the most fake looking nose I have ever seen. The main female character plays an US Army Officer with noticeably strong British accent. The motorcycle chase scene reminded me of the MotoRacer game on my iPhone (this is not a compliment).<br /><br />Captain America is never in danger of being killed, injured, or even getting his suit dirty because, well, he is Captain America. He deals with his enemies like a video game character with only about 3-4 moves that are constantly repeated. Moreover, Captain America is just too cool to use guns (except once) to kill the enemies. He just uses his shield and knocks out his enemies like a real hero. In the Marvel Comic world, real heros don't use guns and seldom kill, even if the character is an Army Captain fighting the Nazis in WWII.<br /><br />I didn't think this was a particularly bad movie (hence the 3 stars). I would have seriously enjoyed this movie if I was 12. But grown-ups tend to like slightly different movies, and movie like this just is not one of them.<br /><br />FYI, I really enjoyed Superman (1978), Spiderman 2, and Batman Returns. This movie does not belong in that category of great super-hero comic book movies.

B00127RAJY|3.0|i purchased this workout dvd because i decided i needed a change, to be healthier and skinnier. i changed my diet(gluten free)quit drinking and started doing this workout daily(except weekends). I am now at week 5 with this video and this is what ive determined  Pro  -great workout video because i can keep up with the moves  -great that there two different people to watch, one for beginners and one for advance  -there are 3 seperate workouts on the video  -ive probably lost about 2 inches and have toned up a bit   Cons  -i seem to be stuck at 2 inches and being toned up just a bit  -at this point im pretty bored with the workout  -i have only lost 3 pounds...starting to loose motivation.  -i feel like certain body parts get worked really well, ie. quands, but not others, ie. inner thighs, etc.   im still gonna keep with it just because i feel a little healthier, but being 5'5 and 193 pounds im getting pretty fustrated that my clothes arent really fitting any differently at this point...

B004LROUNG|3.0|Just got done reading this book. I've read all John Grisham and love it when a new one comes out. It was good but lacked the usual suspense. Plot was predictable and I skimmed over a lot of the blah blah descriptions that aren't needed. Just makes the book seem longer. I would call it unnecessary filler. Still it was fun to read and I hated putting it down. Overall a fast read if you speed read the boring stuff. Still one of my favorite authors. Buy it on sale if you can.
0811871258|5.0|this is a fantastic overview of jean's career! i purchased this for my boyfriend, who is an art student and loves jean's work. it was supposed to be a christmas present but i couldn't help but give it to him early because i knew it would brighten his day and be a source of inspiration to keep working. we are both longtime fans and have seen most of his work online, following his career in publications and via jean's blog, but it's always nice to add another book to our art collection.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I thought I might dislike having it be two movies, but I have to say I am really glad that they did that.  Some of the other movies (particularly The Goblet of Fire) left out ALOT from the book, which I missed.  Clearly after seeing how long the two movies are, there is no way they could have included all of the story in one movie and done it justice.  I'm very glad they decided to spend the money and the time to make it two movies and do it right.<br /><br />Goblet of Fire will always remain my favorite story line, but this one has to be a close second, and I thought it was done very well.  I particularly liked the animation of the story of the Deathly Hallows as Hermione is reading it; very creative.  As always, I thought most of the acting was great, and the special effects were fantastic.  As a fan of both the books and the movies, it is hard to come up with much negative to say.  That said, I have only read the book once, so I cannot speak to inaccuracies or discrepancies, so if that kind of thing really nags at you I cannot recommend one way or the other.  As a good watch and an epic story, though, I'll recommend away.

0385333846|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut.  I read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" and \\"Galapagos,\\" and didn't like either one of them.  I would describe both books this way: a random series of unhappy events, written in simple language, and tied loosely together by a trite, unfocused thesis.  I suppose I just don't `get' Vonnegut.  Anyway, I'm happy to report that I *did* like this book, even though (oddly) I would describe it much the same way.  The book is - at its core - an anti-war book, at the same time exploring concepts of free-will and the nature of time.  Vonnegut proposes that time is an illusion, and that everything actually has happened, happens, and will happen all at once.  The book is written in a non-linear way, and the main character jumps back and forth in time to illustrate this idea.  It works!  As you're reading the book, it seems as though everything is happening at once.  That makes the unhappy events less upsetting, because if you don't like the unhappy times, you just `don't look at them' (as Vonnegut suggests), and focus instead on another event that's going on simultaneously.  Death is something that just happens sometimes - `so it goes' - but if you don't like it, then you simply choose to look at something else.  It's not 100% clear to me whether Vonnegut was poking fun at these ideas, but regardless he wrote a unique, thought-provoking book.  I liked it a lot.

1400052181|5.0|This is an outstanding book about a woman named Henrietta Lacks who died in 1951 from an aggressive form of cervical cancer.  Her cancerous cells were used without her permission to form the first - and most important - immortal cell-line ever created.  Known as \\"HeLa,\\" after the woman from whom it was taken, this cell line has been of incalculable importance to cellular biology, drug development, and medical progress.  Equally important in the narrative are Henrietta's descendents, and the way in which they cope when they learn that their late-mother's cells have been stolen, grown by the trillions, and used without permission.     The story turns out to be quite complex.  Ms. Skloot has to write about two distinct generations of people, and explain the scientific, ethical, and moral issues surrounding the use of cells in medical science.  The ethical issues are complicated by the fact that Ms. Lacks was an African American living in the still-segregated South of the 1950s, and her cells were taken without her permission.  In the historical context of horrific medical experiments conducted on black men and women, this is a particularly sensitive topic.  Ms. Skloot does an excellent job of balancing all these aspects of the story and manages to integrate them into a compelling narrative.      At first blush I find the ethical issues surrounding the use of cells in medical research easy to address.  (a) Yes, doctors should be allowed to use cells that would otherwise be discarded to further medical research.  (b) And no, you should not expect to realize any monetary gains from those cells - just as you would not expect any monetary gain from any other thing you discard.  However I must add to these glib statements the caveat that in-so-doing, scientists and doctors should do no harm.  *That's* where the situation gets complicated!  Ms. Lacks's descendants - having grown up in a deeply racist culture, and being largely uneducated in matters of science - were terrifiedwhen they learned that their mother's cells had been stolen and grown in petri dishes.  They believed that their mother's soul still inhabited those cells.  They believed that their mother was being tortured and used in medical experiments.  They believed that clones of their mother were wandering around, and that monstrous mutant hybrids - partly formed from their mother, and part animal or vegetable had been created in labs around the world.  They were also, over the years, pestered unceasingly by self-serving journalists, reporters, doctors, and scientists, seeking more cells, or information about their cells.  Their lives came to be defined by their mother's cervical cancer, and they were - without question - harmed in the process.  With that backdrop, it's much harder to justify the creation of the HeLa cell line - although you and I have benefited from them in innumerable ways.  The ethical questions become quandaries, and the moral issues are less easily addressed than I would glibly have liked.  It's a really interesting book.     One more thing deserves mention:  I've listened to many audiobooks in the car, and the quality of the narrations varies considerably.  There are at least two narrators whom I can't stand; I will not listen to any books they narrate.  Several other narrators are okay, but make frequent mistakes - the most common of which occurs when the narrator has chosen to use different voices for different characters, and forgets which voice to use.  The narrator of this book, Casandra Campbell, was absolutely picture-perfect.  She got everything right, including the tone of voice, grammatical idiosynchrasys of the characters - even accents.  She's amazing.       To top it all off, the audiobook comes complete with an interview of the author, Rebecca Skloot.  In it, she answers many of the questions that sprang to my mind as I listened to the book.  The publisher did well to include it.

1613821409|1.0|This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it.  Unfortunately, it is truly miserable.  I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.     To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man.  But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.     This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.  It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women.  Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them.  Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters.  The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep.  The book is  full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true.  Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to.  But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.     The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless.  Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents:  Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music.  Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed.  By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful.  The lesson seems to be:  harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband.  I just can't get behind that.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This film won the best picture and the best screenplay awards at the Sundance Film Festival and the best actor award at Cannes. All three were well deserved. The film is very moving, well acted, and has an interesting and suspenseful story. It focuses on a likeable 17 year old girl whose mother has lost her mind, and she must care for her and her loving 12 year old brother and 6 year old sister in the hill country where semi-literate people live and where they produce illegal drinks and drugs. Her father had been convicted previously for these activities and was caught again. He put up his house, where the 17 year old and her family live, as bail. Then he disappeared. She is told that unless she can find him and bring him to the trial, she will lose her home. This all she has. In fact she needs help from neighbors for food.<br /><br /> She searches for her dad and meets strong resistance. People threaten her. At one point, she is beat up badly. An old girl friend of her father tells her that she saw him recently in the company of fierce men that she didn't recognize. He made believe he didn't recognize her. She said she was sure that \\"something was going on.\\"<br /><br /> This riveting thriller raises intriguing questions. Is he alive and, if so, where is he? Is he hiding and, if so, why? Is he dead? Who killed him? Why was he killed? Was the sheriff involved? How can she save her home? If he is dead, how can she prove it? Why are people trying to keep her from finding her dad?
0307279189|4.0|When I downloaded this book from the library, I expected it to be something akin to Ultramarathon Man, by Dean Karnazes, which I read earlier this year.  I enjoyed Ultramarathon Man, but at its core, it's really just the somewhat-self-serving story of the author.  (And there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not the sort of book that I want to read again and again).  I was, therefore, initially skeptical about reading Born To Run, and even passed it over once or twice as I browsed through the library's selection.  But eventually I downloaded it, and am pleased to report that the book is nothing like Ultrmarathon Man! (A fact I would have known had I bothered to read the summary description).  Rather than focusing on one man, this book explores the sport of ultra-long distance running.  To be sure, there are some central characters in the book to whom the author returns to again and again.  But these characters (interesting and unique individuals though they are) are more like \\"supporting actors,\\" intended to convey the thesis of the book which is:  \\"human beings evolved to run long distances.  We're good at it, it can be fun, and we all should do it.\\"  Like many people, I found the book inspirational (although I hate that word).  It made some interesting points, and brought up some fascinating questions, the most poignant (for me) being the question:  \\"when did running stop being fun?\\"  Mr. McDougall makes the point that when you're a little kid, running is something you want to do.  In his words:  \\"When you were little, half the fun of doing anything was doing it at top speed.\\"  That rang true to me - little kids are always wanting to run around - playing tag, hide and seek, or just running for the sheer pleasure of running.  Heck, when I was in first and second grade, I played a game called \\"cooties\\" with the girls one-grade-below me.  The game involved the entire class of girls chasing after me at recess, trying to tag me three times.  That meant that I was running at top-speed for a total of 45 minutes a day (3x 15 minute recesses).  What a great work out, and what fantastic fun!  I am sad to report that never since then have I had ten screaming girls chasing after me, but that's not really the point.  The point is:  I used to run for fun.  Now (in general) I don't, except when I'm playing soccer or tennis, or some other organized sport.  That's a bit sad, but I'm not sure what the solution is, except to start running more, and hope that I enjoy it.    I've digressed somewhat from the topic of this book.  I definitely recommend it - although a complaint raised by some reviewers deserves mention, which is that it glorifies the quintessential \\"simple life.\\"  Mr. McDougall endorses subsisting on a vegetarian diet, and running barefoot.  He glorifies the lives of a rural tribe of South American Indians, and rails against the modern, technological world.  In places, it really is a little too much.  But if you don't want to drink all the kool-aid, that's okay - you can still enjoy the book.  And more than a few sips of his thesis are downright refreshing.
B005Q5OLC2|3.0|Thanks to the generosity of a priest visiting her Irish hometown, young Eilis Lacey finds herself a new life in America. For the first time, Eilis must leave the protection of her older sister Rose, who has long been her guide to life, as well as her widowed mother, and make her own way in Brooklyn.  Eilis struggles with homesickness, becoming accustomed to a new country's ways, with her job at a large department store, and getting along with her landlady and the other young women at her boardinghouse. She also strives to better herself by taking night classes in accounting at Brooklyn Colllege.   Later, Eilis meets Tony, a young Italian who is quickly smitten with her. Just as she imagines a future with him, a sudden tragedy back in Ireland takes her home, and Eilis must decide if she wants to continue her American life or slip back into the familiar background of home.  While the overall story arc is interesting and seems full of promise, the author simply takes too long telling about Eilis' experiences. The narrative tends to drag, and the reader spends a great deal of time waiting for some kind of larger-scale events that never really seem to happen.

B005TQAI6G|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying that I attended this concert back in June and felt that it was an incredible show. Most of the time I can't stand to watch full length concerts on tv because I'd rather be attending the actual concert. It took alot of self control to sit down and watch this, but after getting into it, it made me remember how much of a great time I had at the concert. So, all in all I enjoyed the filmed concert very much so.   Before I had the chance to view the concert via EpixHD.com, the only footage from the concert that I had seen was small snippets of certain songs. The only problem I had with the sneak peak footage was how the live/pre-recorded vocals that I had heard at the concert were dubbed over with the actual track. Thus making it look like, at certain times, that Britney is lip syncing very poorly. At first I thought I would have a problem with the film angles because there were only 3 different cameras. But everything turned out great! I enjoyed it immensely.  If you are a Britney fan, you will love this dvd. If not, then leave negative comments aside and walk away. The Britney that people watch and observe today is no where near the Britney that people fell in love with 10 years ago. Which is why there are devoted fans that have stood by her through thick and thin. Britney doesn't perform to please haters, she performers to please her fans and because she loves doing so. Yes she isn't the same performer she was when she first started. But if I had 2 knee injuries, 2 kids, and a highly publicized meltdown, I would have just given up. She is still going strong and that's why millions still love her, because she didn't quit and give up like so many would have done. It takes a strong person to comeback from what she went through, which is why fans love her.   Once again, If you are a Britney fan, I highly recommend this concert for you. It was such a great show and is really in the top two shows of her career. There is a little bit of the old and new in this concert.   ENJOY! :)
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Loved it.  Not sure why it got some negative reviews.  I'm mostly adding my two cents to counter balance someones one star review.  My five stars are for real though.  Loved it.
B0047BXRB2|5.0|Got it! Saw it when it first showed at the theater in Washington DC. The old Wineland theater over off of Atlantic Street S.E. next to Someplace Else. Years Later the English Setters used to play there. I remember watching movies and hearing the music coming through the walls from next door. Anyway this was my favorite movie along with the Blob. I just bought it recently to show my 5 year old. He loves outer space stuff too. It's a classic movie.
B006470HZ6|1.0|This show has gone from bad to worse with the second season. They should simply remove the zombies, they never get more than 2 minutes in the series. I expected to see more zombies than endless chatter. This series is just filled endless talking and crying. Lots of grown men crying constantly. Need a downer for the week?... just watch an episode. I do not plan on paying to hear people just chat on and on about their issues and no one is being proactive in establishing anything for themselves. Why can't they go find there own house to live in. The have the whole US to pick a house at this point.   To summarize my review..... the opposite of crack writing!
B0061DOEJI|5.0|I love both Betty Wright and The Roots, but since I wasn't very fond of The Roots' collaberation with John Legend, I didn't hold much hope for this release.

I definitely recommend it for Betty Wright fans, Roots fans and any fan of real, authentic soul music.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I am a person who has read many, many self help books, over the last 25 years, including many books on meditation and spirituality. From this perspective, I found this book a ticket to the implementation of taking over control of my mind -- and therefore, my moods. I have received a valued gift from the author-- and I am grateful. If you can be aware of the shift of a mood --say from positive to negative--and you can back track to that first whisper of a thought, that started the negative neural loop, then you can refute that whisper and get on a happier road in your mind. She calls this 'tending the garden of your mind'. She brought all the stuff I had read over the years into a conclusive \\"how- to\\". The how-to  is simple; simple does not mean fast, nor does it mean easy. Last word of advise:you must be AWARE and observant. By aware, I mean you need to notice when you are happy and notice when you became unhappy and be able to observe what event, thought, emotion, energetic vibe got you to that place. Personal example:I notice that my son and I can get into a neural loop of complaining about where we live. When I notice(finally)that we are on that negative neural pathway, I suggest that we talk about what has happened here that is good. In a matter of minutes, we are on a happy track in our minds. It is really just that simple. YOur job is to notice, observe, be aware. Once you can do that, the author gives you tips on how to jump over to a more desired neural pathway in your brain.  This book is one of my top 5 books on how to live a more happy life. And I have read lots of books... Blessings....
1451627289|4.0|As a baby boomer and a Stephen King fan, I was giddy with delight while waiting for this book to be published. I wanted to love it. After reading it, I'll say I like it and am glad I read it. I won't give anything away, or review every detail.  Time travel pretty much gives the main character, Jake Epping/George Amberson, the right to do anything he wants, and what he wants is to stop the Kennedy asassination. King paints him as Joe Average, he could be any man, and able to fit in easily in both timelines. (I did find myself wondering if the main character had been a woman, how hard it would be for her to travel from 2011 to 1958 and not experience severe culture shock.)You spend all of your time with Epping/Amberson, and you can't help but like him as he goes about his business, living his life in 2011 then back to '58 to '63, waiting for the big  finale. To King's credit, he doesn't go for gimmicks, Jake/George never runs into Marilyn or Elvis, for example, he does try to lead an average exisitance.  While I love the idea of the book, the reality is it has a fifty-fifty chance of ending one way, and we all know it has to be Kennedy is saved, or Kennedy is killed. I found myself missing the element of surpise here, the not knowing. Even what happens in the aftermath was kind of a predictable disappointment.  King has a terrfic ability to make you care about his characters, and that's what makes this book good. You invest yourself in this man and his relationships, and you want a happy ending for all. To quote Mick and Keith \\"You can't always get what you want,but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.\\" I got what I needed out of the book, an entertaining read.

0307887898|3.0|After reading Clayton Christensen, Geoffrey Moore and Steve Blank, I was expecting a lot from The Lean Startup by Eric Ries. I was disappointed. It could be that I did not read it well or too fast, but I was expecting much more. But instead of saying what I did not like, let me begin with the good points. Just like the previous three authors, Ries shows that innovation may be totally counterintuitive: \\"My cofounders and I are determined to make new mistakes. We do everything wrong. We build a minimum viable product, an early product that is terrible, full of bugs and crash-your-computer-yes-really stability problems. Then we ship it to customers before it's ready. And we charge money for it. After securing initial customers, we change the product constantly. [...] We really had customers, often talked to them and did not do what they said.\\" [page 4] On page 8, Eric Ries explains that the lean startup method helps entrepreneurs \\"under conditions of extreme uncertainty\\" with a \\"new kind of management\\" by \\"testing each element of their vision\\", and \\"learn whether to pivot or persevere\\" using a \\"feedback loop\\".<br /><br />This is he Build-Measure-Learn process. He goes on by explaining why start-ups fail:<br />1- The first problem is the allure of a good plan. \\"Planning and forecasting are only accurate when based on a long, stable operating history and a relatively static environment. Startups have neither.\\"<br />2- The second problem is the \\"Just-do-it\\". \\"This school believes that chaos is the answer. This does not work either. A startup must be managed\\".<br />The main and most convincing lesson from Ries is that because start-ups face a lot of uncertainty, they should test, experiment, learn from the right or wrong hypotheses as early and as often as possible. They should use actionable metrics, split-test experiments, innovation accounting. He is also a big fan of Toyota lean manufacturing.<br /><br />I loved his borrowing of Komisar's Analogs and Antilogs. For the iPod, the Sony Walkman was an Analog (\\"people listen to music in a public place using earphones\\") and Napster was an Antilog (\\"although people were willing to download music, they were not willing to pay for it\\"). [Page 83] Ries further develops the MVP, Minimum Viable Product: \\"it is not the smallest product imaginable, but the fastest way to get through the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop.\\" Apple's original iPhone, Google's first search engine, or even Dropbox Video Demo were such MVPs. More on Techcrunch [page 97]. He adds that MVP does not go without risks, including legal issues, competition, branding and morale of the team. He has a good point about intellectual property [page 110]: \\"In my opinion, [...the] current patent law inhibits innovation and should be remedied as a matter of public policy.\\"<br /><br />So why did I feel some frustration? There is probably the feeling Ries gives that his method is a science. [Page 3]: \\"Startup success can be engineered by following the right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught.\\" [Page 148]: \\"Because of the scientific methodology that underlies the Lean Startup, there is often a misconception that it offers a rigid clinical formula for making pivot or persevere decisions. There is no way to remove the human element - vision, intuition, judgment - from the practice of entrepreneurship, nor that would be desirable\\". I was probably expecting more recipes, as the ones Blnak gives in The Four Steps to the Epiphany. So? Art or science? Ries explains on page 161 that pivot requires courage. \\"First, Vanity Metrics can allow to form false conclusions. [...] Second, an unclear hypothesis makes it impossible to experience complete failure, [...] Third, many entrepreneurs are afraid. Acknowledging failure can lead to dangerously low morale.\\" A few pages before (page 154), he writes that \\"failure is a prerequisite to learning\\". Ries describes a systematic method, I am not sure it is a science, not even a process. Indeed, in his concluding chapter, as if he wanted to mitigate his previous arguments, he tends to agree: \\"the real goal of innovation: to learn that which is currently unknown\\" [page 275]. \\"Throughout our celebration of the Lean Startup movement, a note of caution is essential. We cannot afford to have our success breed a new pseudoscience around pivots, MVPs, and the like\\" [page 279]. This in no way diminishes the traditional entrepreneurial virtues; the primacy of vision, the willingness to take bold risks, and the courage required in the face of overwhelming odds\\" [page 278].<br /><br />Let me mention here a video from Komisar. Together with Moore and Blank, he is among the ones who advise reading Ries' book. I am less convinced than them about the necessity to read this book. I have now more questions than answers, but this may be a good sign! I have been more frustrated than enlightened by the anecdotes he gives or his use of the Toyota strategy. In na interview given to the Stanford Venture Technology program, Komisar talks about how to teach entrepreneurship. Listen to him! To be fair, Eric Ries is helping a lot the entrepreneurship movement. I just discovered a new set of videos he is a part of, thanks to SpinkleLab. Fred Destin had also a great post on his blog about the Lean Startup and you should probably read it too to build your own opinion. Lean is hard and (generally) good for you. Fred summaries Lean this way and he is right: \\"In the real world, most companies do too much development and spend too much money too early (usually to hit some pre-defined plan that is nothing more than a fantasy and / or is not where they need to go to succeed) and find themselves with an impossible task of raising money at uprounds around Series B. So founders get screwed and everyone ends up with a bad taste in their mouth. That's fundamentally why early stage capital efficiency should matter to you, and why you should at least understand lean concepts.\\"<br /><br />Let me finish with a recent interview given by Steve Blank in Finland: \\"I have devoted the last decade of my life and my \\"fourth career\\" to trying to prove that methods for improving entrepreneurial success can be taught. Entrepreneurship itself is more of a genetic phenomenon. Either you have the passion and drive to start something, or you don't. I believe entrepreneurs are artists, and I'd like to quote George Bernard Shaw to illustrate: \\"Some men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not.\\" Over the last decade we assumed that once we found repeatable methodologies (Agile and Customer Development, Business Model Design) to build early stage ventures, entrepreneurship would become a \\"science,\\" and anyone could do it. I'm beginning to suspect this assumption may be wrong. It's not that the tools are wrong. Where I think we have gone wrong is the belief that anyone can use these tools equally well. When page-layout programs came out with the Macintosh in 1984, everyone thought it was going to be the end of graphic artists and designers. \\"Now everyone can do design,\\" was the mantra. Users quickly learned how hard it was do design well and again hired professionals. The same thing happened with the first bit-mapped word processors. We didn't get more or better authors. Instead we ended up with poorly written documents that looked like ransom notes. Today's equivalent is Apple's \\"Garageband\\". Not everyone who uses composition tools can actually write music that anyone wants to listen to. It may be we can increase the number of founders and entrepreneurial employees, with better tools, more money, and greater education. But it's more likely that until we truly understand how to teach creativity, their numbers are limited. Not everyone is an artist, after all.\\"en a process.

0553801473|4.0|Having now read the book twice and having spent the last few hours going over hundreds of reviews on here I feel comfortable reaching the following conclusions:<br /><br />1. A Dance with Dragons is overall a well-written book.<br /><br />2. However, it is the least \\"self-contained\\" book of the series and does not have a very satisfying story arc when considered as a single volume.<br /><br />3. What it does do very well is build up the tension on virtually every major plotline to the breaking point.<br /><br />4. However, The lack of resolution of several (most) of the plotlines and the delay in releasing the book have ticked a lot of folks off.<br /><br />5. This appears to have lead these folks to write disparaging reviews that are disproportionate to the real merits of the book.<br /><br />6. Personally, I'd rank this book 4th best in the series.<br /><br />7. My complete ranking is as follows: 1. Storm of Swords  2. Game of Thrones  3. Clash of Kings  4. Dance with Dragons 5. Feast For Crows

I like having the HP movies on my iphone so it looks like I'll be plunking down another $15 to get it directly from itunes.  WB should be ashamed of themselves for using such a crap product.  Way to make an elegant and seamless technology complicated and ridiculous!!

B005PK58TI|4.0|A really, really, really good show.  Very dark, disturbing, but intriguing.  Very well-acted, great writing.  Somewhat disgusted that they chose to glamorize a Columbine-style incident in one of the episodes, though.  Even so far as to have the student gunman ask a victim, \\"Do you believe in God\\"?  C'mon, there's a poor taste line that should not be crossed, guys.  This crosses the line.  Otherwise, very dark but entertaining show so far.

B005VGWT2K|3.0|George Harrison: Living in the Material World is a documentary by Martin Scorsese. The film is approximately four hours long, and since HBO doesn't allow folks to pause for bathroom breaks, delivered in two parts, the evenings of October 5 and 6. It was billed by Olivia Harrison, the ex-Beatle's widow, as definitive. She admitted that it was made, in part, to get the adulatory public off her (and son Dhani's) back.<br /><br />I suppose it's entirely possible to enjoy an artist, only to dislike a documentary or biopic about the person. This happens rarely; in fact, it's more often than not the opposite. It's revealing to watch films like Scott Joplin, where Billy Dee Williams played the very-unlikeable ragtime star. I liked the film. I learned a lot, through the filter of Hollywood storytelling of course, but these things are informative. Recently, I reviewed No Direction Home, Scorsese's documentary that reveals Bob Dylan's early years. I find Dylan to be an extremely unlikeable fellow, but I left the film feeling sympathetic toward him. Furthermore, I admired Scorsese's craftsmanship.<br /><br />The opposite occurred when I watched Living in the Material World. Maybe this is because I knew the story already. I've read a number of biographies about the guy, watched all ten hours of the Beatles Anthology, and heard most of the film clips. It was interesting to hear Eric Clapton's voice, as well as former wives Patty Boyd and Olivia Harrison. The usual cast was there: the surviving ex-Beatles, and their inner circle, as well as Yoko Ono, sitting in for John. We also got to see auto racer Jackie Stewart, Monty Python alumnus Eric Idle, and rocker Tom Petty.<br /><br />The story was banal. What stones were there left to turn over? The media have scavenged for Beatles trivia for the fifty years now, when they first landed their recording contract. We knew George wrote Taxman, and had a stereotypically Scottish obsession with hoarding money. We knew he was quite sour with Paul when the Beatles broke up. We knew he poured himself into Eastern thoughts and religion.<br /><br />Scorsese barely mentions Harrison's family. Is this out of respect to Harrison's privacy, or does the director just view it as irrelevant? I notice that No Direction Home pays no attention to Dylan's family either. I suppose I found myself wishing the film had dug deeper.<br /><br />The friends interviewed seemed to universally state things like \\"I wish I believed we were close friends, but I just don't know.\\" Even Clapton, who I always assumed was Harrison's closest friend, said this, as did Tony Stewart, Jeff Lynne, Eric Idle, and Tom Petty. It makes me wonder where the title came from. I assume because of his adherence to Eastern thought. Harrison himself marks Ravi Shankar as one of the most influential human beings in his life: \\"certain people can teach without saying a word. Ravi Shankar is one of those people.\\"<br /><br />Olivia said that one of George's greatest regrets of Lennon's 1980 death was that John was unable to leave his body in the way he chose. This was a predominant narrative throughout the latter half of the film. George says everything in life was a preparation for his moment of death, when he leaves his body. I suppose, in a way, this was my one discovery from the film: all life, for George, is a preparation for being ready to die. His thoughts were nearly borne out in 1999: the documentary devotes 10 or 15 minutes to Harrison's home invasion, when he and his wife were stabbed and nearly killed by a deranged fan. It made me think of the line from the Bob Dylan track \\"It's All Right Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\": \\"...he not busy being born is busy dying.\\" I wondered if Scorsese noticed the similarity between the philosophies of his two subjects.<br /><br />The first ten minutes of the documentary were chaotic, in a rapidfire review of several songs and pictures, from current Harrison to old Beatles at their peak, to a pre-Beatles Harrison on a tape recorder. Cutaways in the first ten minutes were of video and still montages, songs, color and b&w. If I had not known Harrison's early story, I'd have felt a bit cheated, as the overwhelming amount of information being given me at once. I'm sure it was intentional on Scorsese's part. Every once in awhile, throughout the film the editing was startling: there would be several seconds of black, or moving from a song, to silence. I'm sure these effects, too, had some sort of meaning. It escaped me, and simply proved to be an annoying distraction.<br /><br />There were a few moments of joy and beauty. He loved his garden, and worked for hours on end, sometimes by moonlight. We find out that in the 1970s he gave up the sitar, when he realized that his medium would always be guitar; and there, he redoubled his efforts to pop music. We understand, from two or three new angles, the story of Patty Boyd, Clapton, and Harrison. Clapton himself refers to the Harrison home in Esher as Camelot, and to himself as Lancelot. Two or three letters home, to Harrison's mother, while on tour, were beautifully and touchingly read. Harrison's was the only family untouched by death or divorce. When Ringo told the camera Harrison's last words to him, a tear ran down the drummer's eye, as well as my wife's and my own.<br /><br />In well, it was a well-executed, if pedestrian documentary. The first quarter-hour was chaotic and confusing. It gave nothing new to veteran Beatles fans. I liked it. Nothing amazing.d still montages, songs, color and b&w.

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Dave Mustaine is definitely back on top of his game, or at least as close as he's ever going to get again. Musically, this is superb and everyone in the band is firing on all cylinders. Chris Broderick is the best guitarist in the band since Friedman and is simply amazing here. Production is very good and overall, this is a VERY satisfactory and enjoyable listen. If I had any complaint, it would be about some of the lyrics. Some of them come across very juvenile, but then maybe Dave is courting a younger audience. Nonetheless, this is a heavy and consistent album, something you couldn't say about Megadeth albums for a few years. Worth the purchase, so get it NOW.
0753140276|4.0|I've been avoiding the work of Terry Pratchett for several years. I don't know why. Maybe it's because, when I learned about him, my first thoughts were \\"I already read The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" Maybe my thoughts strained against the idea that fantasy should be treated with humor and a light touch. I'll probably never know, but, as of today, I'm no longer unfamiliar with Terry Pratchett. I read (on the recommendation of fark.com--don't ask) Pratchett's fourth novel: a book called Mort. The book takes place in the fantasy land called Discworld, which rides on the back of four elephants, who of course stand on the back of the great turtle A'Tuin. The entire land is surrounded by a waterfall that pours forever into space.<br /><br />The hero of the story is an all-elbows teenaged redhead named Mortimer, or \\"Mort\\" as he often reminds acquaintances. His father believes him to be likeable, but generally worthless, so he takes him to the marketplace to begin an apprenticeship to anyone who will have him. His new master, it turns out, is Death, in all his dark-cloaked, skeleton-faced scythe-wielding badness. Death, it turns out, has need of a vacation as much as an apprentice. Death is lonely and friendless; apart from his adopted daughter and aged servant Albert, he has no interaction with anyone except when it is time for them to die. Much too soon, Death hands the reins over to the young lad.<br /><br />As in all apprentice stories, there are rules about these things: you can't muck about with fate. When it's time for someone to go, it's time for them to go. To do anything else could cause a rift in space/time. Also, as in all apprentice stories, the lad almost immediately takes a liking to a princess and (maybe inadvertently?) ends the life of her assassin instead of her. Meanwhile, where Death (WHO ALWAYS SPEAKS IN ALL CAPS!) tries a series of experiments with the things humans find pleasurable: first tying fishing flies, then sampling dozens of alcoholic beverages, quizzing a celebrant about the concept of \\"fun,\\" and finally becoming a short-order cook at a local pub. Death's interview with the employment agent provided one of the funniest scenes of the book, and the gem of a line: \\"It would seem that you have no useful skill or talent whatsoever... Have you thought of going into teaching?\\"<br /><br />Pratchet doesn't often let his comedy get in the way of telling the story. From chapter to chapter, I never was sure what I'd read next. Pratchett occasionally allows his narrator to break through the Fourth Wall: at one point, making reference to ancient literature like Shakespeare, or ancient lore (St George and the Dragon, for example). Often Death speaks of modern science or science-fiction ideas, which befuddle the decidedly-medieval populace of Discworld. Sometimes you get the feeling the author is trying too hard to land a laugh. We read incidental rambles like this one: \\"He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king, and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary particles -- kingons, or possibly queons -- that do this job, but of course succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in order to modulate the signal, were never fully expanded because, at that point, the bar closed\\" and they occur slightly too often for my taste. Sometimes he also goes for the easy laugh: \\"Sodomy non sapiens,\\" said Albert under his breath. \\"What does that mean?\\" \\"I'm buggered if I know.\\" As I said, though, none of this manages to detract from the story. I found myself grinning throughout the novel. Pratchett has considerable facility with similes. Early in the book, Mort is described as having \\"the same talent for horticultureas you'd find in a dead starfish,\\" with a \\"body that is only marginally under its owner's control--it seemed to have been made out of knees.\\" And thus it begins. The line is not an auspicious one as Adams calling the people of earth a race \\"who still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea\\" Still, I found Pratchett's cadence for humor, and it wasn't overdone or didn't detract from the story. In that by itself, my fears were never realized. I enjoyed the novel, and would read a few more of the many, many Discworld books he's written.sh,\\" with a \\"body that is only marginally under its owner's control--it seemed to have been made out of knees.\\" And thus it begins.

And others posters are right, Lu-lay Lu-lay is NOT a lullaby. It's mourning the deaths from \\"The Slaughter of the Innocents.\\"  What better backup than women from parts of Africa where such monstrosities still happen.<br /><br />Fred Waring is as comfortable as seeing old fashioned large Christmas tree bulbs.

Ghosts riding in cars, meeting at Starbucks and constantly dry-humping teens is a little too much for me. It lost its sweet subtlety.<br /><br />I also don't like the Columbine parallels. This is not the right platform to tell that story even a little bit. One of the teenage ghosts quotes one of the murderers asking a victim, \\"Do you believe in God?\\" - not cool. To make it worse, when the flashback appears of Tate killing everyone the writers forgot to include that line when he kills the girl. Ugh. Bad on several levels.<br /><br />Jessica Lange deserves an award for her role though - AMAZING!!! I really want this show to be good and maybe it'll improve by the second season. Right now it's filled with way too many implausibilities - even for a ghost story.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am giving this product one star not because of the Blu-ray or film itself.  I want to make my voice heard that Ultraviolet is an abomination, and to substitute it for a real digital copy is an absolute travesty.  I watch digital copies on my iPad when I'm on the road--like on long flights across the Pacific.  I'm sure I'm not alone.  Furthermore, why would I want to waste like an entire month's worth of 3G bandwidth to watch a movie?  It's asinine.  Even more awesome is that HP1 came with a real digital copy.  Guess I can free up a few GB on my iPad and hard drive by deleting that file.  Sure doesn't do much good to have half the movie available to me...  I will never pay 1 cent extra for another disc with Ultraviolet.  I will stick with the cheaper single disc versions until I get real digital copies.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I'm uploading some of my own photos right now.   If you've seen the cases that people walk around with their iPads in - this is the exact same thing.   It's a plastic case covering 5 sides of the Fire, on par with the hard plastic iPad cases you see. The cover is felt on the inside, and is made of thin plastic or some kind of card stock covered in plastic. The elastic band can be held around the back to keep it secure while reading, or it can be moved around to the front to keep the screen cover in place.   The case seems protective enough for me - this is a tablet, I'm not going to be throwing it around. It's about as protective as your average cellphone case. The problem is, at $40 this is terrible value for what you actually see when you hold it in your hands.   The complaints about the \\"stand\\" function are valid. It's not stable at all. Poor quality.  My principle complaint about this case is that at $40, it's about $30 overpriced. This item obviously cost less than $1 to make.   It's better than nothing. I will probably return it because the stand function was why I bought it, but this isn't a 1-star item.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|When I came across this series for the first time I was amazed!  Every episode (except one of them) was absolutely wonderful.  I have watched it literally at least 20 times then gone back and bought sets for my friends.  You will not be disappointed.  It died before it's time.
B005JLN9ZI|1.0|This album is horrible, terrible beats, terrible lyrics, just an awful album all around and proves that Drake has finally begin to fit in with the rest of Young Money because his music is trash now. His flow is repetitive now and it's almost like he's trying to sound like Wayne which should be enough to throw the CD in the garbage. I try to do the right thing and support albums and musicians like this (because I liked Thank Me Later) by buying their stuff and then I get garbage like this which was a waste of money. If you want a good album get Wale's Ambition it's way better than this trash.
0307460444|4.0|In truth, I have only tested one recipe and it was prepared FOR by an 8 year old girl.  This cupcake was THE best cupcake I have EVER had.  If an 8 year old girl (albeit a child with a lot of cake and candy making experience) can follow Martha's recipe book and create this perfect dessert, I don't see why anyone else should fail.  I am really fond of red velvet cupcakes and I can only imagine how Martha's would be but the Jumbo Marshmallow Cream Chocolate Cupcake with sour cream and dutch cocoa was perfection.  Wow.  The book looks good.  Some of these reviews make me leery of purchasing one of my own.  However, Martha Stewart is a perfectionist.  It is very difficult to believe there would be flaws in her recipes...especially after tasting this...
B003XE1D1A|4.0|These shoes are so comfortable especially if you have problems with your feet.  At times these are the only shoes that I can wear because they're so soft, but still have support.  They don't flip off, which is great.  I normally wear a wide shoe and these fit great.
B005LAIGFA|5.0|In the history of America during the 20th century, few people were as revered, admired, feared, and hated (sometimes all at once) as J. Edgar Hoover, the mercurial, often-paranoid man who ruled over the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1924 until his death in 1972.  In his time, he saw the expunging of Communist subversives, the destruction of Depression-era gangsters like John Dillinger, and an ability to keep tabs and files on people in high places in the U.S. government, including all the presidents and attorneys general that he held sway over, not to mention even ordinary citizens whom he felt were disloyal to American values.  But there was that one personal secret of his that he definitely did not want getting out, which would have destroyed the image he had built up of himself as the toughest law enforcement chief there was.  All of Hoover's aspects, savory and unsavory alike, are shown in great detail by director Clint Eastwood in J. EDGAR, one of the great biopics of recent vintage.  Told largely in flashbacks that span the first indications in 1919 of a Bolshevik revolution threatening America, to 1972, when Hoover died, J. EDGAR stars Leonardo DiCaprio in a mesmerizing performance as the tough-as-nails FBI man who prided himself of getting rid of the rotten elements in American society, and ordering his bureau and his agents to live up to his professional standards of loyalty and patriotism.  Both Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black depict the great things Hoover's FBI did, but they don't whitewash the fact that he was also a shameless, unapologetic huckster and salesman at boosting the FBI image at home and abroad, sometimes even boosting his own image by taking credit for certain big FBI catches (capturing the killer of Charles Lindbergh's baby; the killing of Dillinger) that he was never even present at--and, of course, the fact that his relationship with his close aid Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) was, how shall we say, more than merely professional.  Eastwood, more content now to be behind the camera than in front of it, gets a great performance out of DiCaprio, as well as solid turns by Naomi Watts (as Hoover's long-time secretary Helen Gundy), Dame Judi Dench (as his mother Annie), and Jessica Hecht as the notorious subversive Emma Goldman, most of them unrecognizable, including DiCaprio, under all the prosthetics and make-up, but still able to deliver the goods.  As a director, Eastwood proved long ago, going all the way back to his directing debut PLAY MISTY FOR ME in 1971, that he was more than just Dirty Harry or the Man With No Name, that he was a director of offbeat and extremely challenging projects, whether or not he was also on the other side of the camera as an actor.  Recent films of his like CHANGELING, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA, INVICTUS, HEREAFTER, and MILLION DOLLAR BABY proved this; and J. EDGAR does as well.  This is a film to be appreciated, not only for its detail, but also for giving us an unvarnished glimpse into a man who, regardless of how one feels about him, changed the face of American law enforcement forever, sometimes for the best, and yet just as often for the worst.
0439023521|3.0|I haven't read all the reviews on this book, so someone else might have already commented on this already. I enjoyed the book. It was quick and riveting. The voyeuristic feel was a little disturbing since I felt like I was one of the Capital viewers enjoying watching the Games. I think this will be even worse when it is made into a movie. By watching the movie you become one of the bad guys. But, that's not the major problem I had with the book. The whole premise of the Games was very poorly explained. Why did they take tributes? I understand the whole District thing, but \\"one District rebelled so each year we take two of your kids, make them fight to the death for our enjoyment, and force you to watch,\\" is a really stupid reason for the Games. That, and everyone in the Capital is so dumb that they don't realize that children are dying? If you could ignore that weakness it was an entertaining book.
B001AQO46E|5.0|Best Ah-nuld movie behind his Terminator 2, ever! movie always is a favorite to watch, even when it has comedy mixed with action-packed loaded with fun!!!! =)
0439023513|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. The first two were page turners, not great, but still entertaining. This book wandered all over the place. It felt like it had at least ten different short stories in it, and the major plot line was seriously flawed. In no world, no matter how dystopian, would the governement have horrendous traps set up in the main streets. That was ridiculous. I understand that the author wanted to encorporate the Hunger Games feel, but that was stupid. Also, I wanted to slap Katniss. Her self-centeredness and introspective whining was annoying. I got it: she killed people, she felt bad about it, I didn't want to read about her weeping and wailing for hundreds of pages. All in all, it was a poorly written plot, with excessive and needless gore, with whining characters. I really didn't like it.
B005POK858|1.0|sound goes out after a few minutes of play and when I hit the volume up button it totally shuts my phone off and reboots on its own.
0439023491|3.0|This book is the middle of the trilogy so I was expecting it to end on a down note, which it did. I was not expecting it to end on a cliffhanger. This book does not stand alone, which is okay, but not what I really enjoy in a book. It ends in the middle of the story without really wrapping anything up. Great for getting us to read the next book, but not very satisfying.<br />I also felt even more like one of the voyeuristic Capital dwellers by enjoying reading about Katniss going back into the Games. Come on everyone, you know you wanted her to go back in there and fight again! How sick are we? The author delivers exactly what we want by contriving to have all the tribute winners sent back into the arena. The arena was rather lame (in my opinion) and the fact that all these tributes couldn't agree to come together and not kill each other was pathetic.<br />Other than that, the book felt like filler as the first half was spent following Katniss around District 12 and hearing her bemoan her horrible lot in life and start her spiral down into craziness.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Hi, I just received this album today, but I couldn't find the 2 bonus tracks? What is the difference between the Deluxe Edition and Regular Edition? Are the bonus tracks only on iTunes?  If anyone knows, tell me please! Thanks!
0545265355|5.0|If you start reading book 1 of this series (The Hunger Games) it's a pretty sure bet that you will end up reading them all, so you may as well cut to the chase and buy the whole set now. This series is theoretically intended for young adult readers, but its plot, characters and themes will captivate adult readers as well. It certainly did so for this one.<br /><br />Far more sophisticated than other series in the young adult genre (Twilight comes to mind), The Hunger Games trilogy addresses compelling and complex themes such as the impacts of war on human development, the role of food and hunger in social systems and the importance of cultivating critical thinking skills. Most of the main characters are adolescents and the setting -- a near future dystopia called Pamen, which means \\"bread\\" in Latin -- provides an excellent context for this coming of age adventure.<br /><br />One of the most striking aspects of these novels is the subtlety of plot. Author Suzanne Collins avoids posing obvious, black-and-white choices for her characters, choosing instead to show her readers that most decisions are not simple and that the needs of others must be considered when making major life choices.  A regular theme is the question of what is \\"real\\" and what is manufactured or imagined, a highly relevant topic in an age like ours, where popular perceptions of reality are formed by mass media, which are under the control of corporate, commercial and government interests.<br /><br />Perhaps the most impressive feature of these novels is that the plot moves swiftly and is interesting enough to hold a reader's attention while still presenting the weighty ideas discussed above. Collins has written a page-turning series of substance that defies easy classification as mere science fiction, young adult novel or thriller. The three books of this trilogy chart the journey of two young people who learn that the only reliable place to find answers lies within themselves.
B005D9B26E|4.0|Unlike other reviews of this nicely packaged box set, I can attest, at least IMHO, that the inlcuded 2011 CD remaster of the full album is subtly better that the 95 version.  The channel seperation is better and clarity of individual instruments and vocal parts is noticeably better than the prior CD.  This can be found immediately in the I am the Sea -> The Real Me > Quadrophenia suite that begins the album, particulary in the segue from The Real Me into Quadrophenia.  All previous digitial versions delivered an extremely trebly experience where the individual instruments, particulary the frenetically strummed acoustic quitar, buried each other in the mix.  The 2011 remaster is the first digital version I've heard that matches the vinyls ability to clarify and present a soundstage in which the individual instruments can be heard cleanly.  The biggest complaint I have with this box, especially considering the price, is that only 8 songs from the full album are included in the multi-channel DVD.  If, as I understand, only the masters for these 8 tracks were found then some more supplemental material should have been included, perhaps even a copy of the excellent Quadrophenia film that came out in 1980.
B005I6EU7U|3.0|For the Verso Prologue Cover in Red: It has the feel of soft, lush leather -- although apparently it is not leather, but you could have fooled me. The problem I'm running into is, this is meant for the Kindle Fire? It just BARELY fits into the elastic straps at each corner. I forced it. I worry that the straps will loosen over time, but time will tell. And the cover doesn't lay completely flat when the \\"book\\" is closed. Maybe like leather, some use will cause the spine to accommodate and relax. It's a beautiful piece, though. I should return it, but I'm not going to, because it's that beautiful.<br /><br />UPDATE: As others have pointed out, there is a backing to the elastic that really holds the Fire securely. That and the fact that it's a tight squeeze to get the Fire in place to begin with, I'm confident that the equipment is very secure. The elastics on top do cover some of the speaker outlet, but I don't notice a difference and when watching a movie or listening to music on a personal device, I use headphones anyway. Even alone.<br /><br />This isn't the right cover if you plan to remove it often, however. For example, I removed the Kindle Keyboard from its case several times a week to put it into a dry sac for pool/bath times. That isn't happening here.<br /><br />Although the elastics are properly flattened and not curled under in any way, the cover still doesn't lay entirely flat. I think the manufacturer would do well to add 1/4\\" to the spine. I don't regret the three-star review, but I am glad I decided to keep it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is pretty much what I expected. I have a similar style hard case for my phone, which I love. Wish it were cheaper, but really all the cases I considered were in this price range. Love the elastic band for keeping the cover in place (front or back). Our Ipad case has a magnetic closure that doesn't work well at all. Since the case came yesterday and the kindle today, more time is needed to see how durable it will be.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I just watched the new blu ray and overall it's wonderful. No problems as has been reported. Buy it and enjoy.
B0067H9W72|4.0|If you read the comics then you pretty much expected a few slow episodes to set things up. I understand why people want to see more zombies, but I also understand why the writers are only giving us a couple at a time. If every week we watched a zombie army attack the camp we would all become numb to it and when the story called for an epic zombie bloodbath it would just be another drop in the bucket.     The thing that surprises me the most about all of these episodes is how closely they follow the comics. I expected the writers to go where ever they wanted but they're staying pretty true to the original story. So as a fan of the comic I couldn't be happier watching the comic being brought to life for TV. Before the late 90's any comic to TV or Movie adaptation was pure garbage and rarely even attempted. I guess that's why I think this show is so great.
B0053B347M|4.0|I bought several of these and have used them around the house to light cabinets, the sock drawer and even my desktop underneath my monitor.  I put red tape over the strip to tone down the light except where I need accurate color - ie the sock drawer.  I cut the cord and installed a little presseure switch in each one so the light comes on when the cabinet door opens.  Adhesive is plenty strong - the reviewer who had a problem must have had some grease on the monitor.  The switch can be installed with 3M outdoor mounting tape (the one with the red backing).  5 volt USB current means no risk of shock or fire.  Very useful product, just maybe not for exacty the use they say....
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|What's this ultraviolet crap? A scam to sign up for another service. Attention executives; the entire world uses iTunes.  I bought a product with three pieces; a Blue ray disc, a DVD, AND a digital copy. But I got screwed out of my digital copy.
B005DMNS4A|1.0|SAME bad remix as the 1996 remaster...Hey Pete....Don't you have enough money? This was supposed to be the remix and remaster of the VINYL mixes! Not so. Same compresssed over the top '96 mix we all know and hate.The MFSL gold CD (long out of print) is the only way to go, fellow Who fans.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Barf!  This is what you'll feel like doing after inflicting this \\"music\\" upon your poor ears.  I'll give credit to Metallica for at least trying, given the sketchy information that they had to work with.  Lou Reed came in with a screwy, half-baked concept, and it was left to the Fearsome Foursome to create music to go along with it.  The band sounds like they're simply improvising, with no preparation beforehand - and this is in fact how it was recorded.  The music sounds OK, but just OK, as a result.  James Hetfield's vocals are pretty sparse, because he has to play second banana to Reed.  Speaking of Reed, his \\"performance\\" on this record is 100% pig swill.  He doesn't even attempt to sing, but rather chants in a wavery, old-man voice about...well, I'm not sure what.  Nothing very pleasant, let's put it that way.  It's extremely depressing listening to him, and it would be depressing no matter what band and/or music was accompanying him.  If you need further convincing, try the following experiment:  First, listen to Metallica's song \\"Orion\\", possibly the best instrumental performance in the history of the universe.  Next, go to the Amazon MP3 store and play some of the previews from 'Lulu', paying close attention to Reed.  Finally, go back and listen to \\"Orion\\" again, but this time imagine Reed blathering away in the foreground, and ruining this timeless slice of Metallica.  (I felt like rinsing out my brain with battery acid just thinking about this.)  Verdict:  Negative five stars.  This album redefines awfulness.
B004XANKVO|2.0|The GOOD... As almost all the reviewers stated... it's a great looking quality backpack. I'm liking it. It's a versatile backpack. I'm using it as a camera bag using a DSLR camera insert/organizer, laptop bag and still have room for overnight cloths. It's quite large but not a kitchen sink holder like my Addidas backpack.  The BAD... I wear Oakley sunglasses ranging from $450-$1500 so the main selling point of this backpack to me is the crush-proof compartment. And granting that it's from THULE, it should work great but alas... crush-proof compartment is... well... not so crush-proof. It can and would collapse easier than you'd expect. I wish that they have used a separate/removable shell like they did on other Crossover backpack. I won't mind putting my iphone and blackberry in it but I wouldn't trust any expensive eyewears specially when used as a carry-on bag and packed full.   For it's price... THULE has flawed the TCBP-217. For that... I'm taking away 3 crucial stars.
0439023521|2.0|I have heard a million wonderful reviews about THE HUNGER GAMES. This and that! Oh, my god! Peeta and Gale! THE HUNGER GAMES! THE HUNGER GAMES! I think I must have read a different book from everyone else because I didn't not see the \\"Oh, so incredible amazement\\" behind this book.<br /><br />When I first received this book I expected to be blown out of my mind. I expected greatness and I felt so weird being singled out totally not getting what was so great about this series. Maybe it was just the writing because I thought the plot and characters were absolutely amazing. Could that be the problem?<br /><br />Anyway, when I started the book I went from being bored to liking it and excited to being bored again, rinse and repeat. That was a negative for me. It took me at least 100 pages to really get into the story and be able to pay attention. And I became distracted very easily while reading this book.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Let's start with Katniss and Peeta! I loved them. I didn't see Katniss as the strong character readers came her to be, but she did leave an impression on me. I loved her emotions throughout the book and her fierceness. And the fact that she was the only one to give up her own live to protect her loved one, her sister. I really admire her.<br /><br />It took me a little while to really see who Peeta was. He was the guy who confessed that her loved Katniss on national television and she totally thought he was insulting her or something when he said it. And the stone cold truth is that he meant every word and she thinks it was just for show to make the audience love them both. I loved Peeta and you could tell he cares about Katniss but Katniss is totally oblivious to it. Open your eyes, Katniss! Peeta is in love with you! For real!<br /><br />Of course we have Haymitch, Effie,and Cinna. They helped Peeta and Katniss get ready for THE HUNGER GAMES and I really liked they're characters! I felt they were very real characters that I could love.<br /><br />I thought the plot of THE HUNGER GAMES had real potential big time! I feel like the thought of throwing children in a game of killing each other for sport where people watch was sick and I felt like I heard this plot line before somewhere or it just seems like the easiest idea for a story line, but that's just me! But like I said the plot had huge potential and I understand why everyone likes it, but I felt like the book was slow and I wasn't thinking about it non-stop or anything.<br /><br />Now onto the Divergent vs. THE HUNGER GAMES. I have no idea how this would have went if I read THE HUNGER GAMES first. I by far think Divergent is a thousand time better than THE HUNGER GAMES and enjoyed it much better. Again, I think this may be due to the writing style or something. I do not know if I will read the next book in THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy, Catching Fire yet. I think I want to wait til I watch the film adaptation, because like I said this trilogy has big potential.ad real potential big time!

B005HSG3TC|3.0|I just got my Kindle Fire (so far so good with the exception of accidentally turning on the \\"screen lock\\" making me think the accelerometer was broken) and this case. The construction is a little bit flimsy but serviceable. Once you close the cover you have to use an elastic strap to keep it closed... kinda low tech.<br />My biggest gripe is with the stand feature. It will only work in the 70 degree mode.<br />If you flip the Kindle over and try it in more of a 45 degree mode, the lip of the cover simply will not stay put in the little slot on the back.  I am guessing it wasn't designed to do this.<br />If I find a better cover I am likely to return this one.<br />/shrug

031250926X|4.0|Just as I was about to buy the regular board book version of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? for my daughter, we saw this one and gave it a shot. I'd never seen a slide and find book before, but when I saw how it worked on the first page, I knew that the format was perfect for this story. Other versions of this book have the animal saying they see x animal looking at them on the same page as them, or on the next page with the animal that's looking at them. It's kind of weird for it to go like that, and I know a few people have expressed how they feel about that, but with this variation, there's nothing to complain about...until the end.<br /><br />When you open the book and the first pages read 'Brown Bear, Brown Bear, what do you see?' at the top, the sliding panel says 'I see a red bird looking at me'. Slide it and you'll reveal a small picture of the red bird. The next page has the regular sized picture of the red bird, and the book continues in this way. It's really cool and my daughter couldn't wait to slide the panel on every page. It makes me wonder why the bigger versions of this book didn't have this feature, like how a lot of Eric Carle's other books have something unique like the scaling pages of The Grouchy Lady Bug, or the bumpy web in The Very Busy Spider. As for the book itself, the artwork is fantastic as usual, and the bright colors will appeal to kids of all ages. This also makes for a great book for children to learn how to read once they've gotten a lot of basic words down, since it follows a pattern with the text.<br /><br />It pains me to give the book less than 5 stars, but for some odd reason, the final pages are missing where the kids in the classroom go over everything they saw in the book. It...doesn't make any sense! It's not enough to knock the rating down to one or two stars, but it certainly was disappointing to see that it wasn't included.<br /><br />Even with that problem, I highly recommend buying this Slide and Find take on Brown Bear. It could've been a 'definitive edition', but man, that last page missing is really lame. Don't let that keep you or your children from enjoying it though. This and the other 'What Do You See?' books are all fun to read at bedtime, or any time for that matter.a 'definitive edition', but man, that last page missing is really lame.

0385738765|4.0|After figuring out the maze, the gladers are facing yet another test, the Scorch Trials. Fighting silver balls, Cranks, each other... and most of all - fighting the elements: the sun flares and the lethal lightenings. Thomas will also have to face betrayal and constantly ask himself \\"is it real?\\".<br /><br />I loved this book. Perhaps even more than I enjoyed the Maze Runner, the first book in the series.<br /><br />As far as characters go, in this book, Newt (which I really liked) takes the back sit and Minho takes the lead. The group also gets to meet Aris, Sonya, Harriet (and others from the girls' team) as well as Jorge and Brenda.<br /><br />this book is also action packed, and unless I heard its audio version, I would call it a \\"page turner\\" :)<br /><br />As the Maze was more of an intellectual test, the Scorch Trials is a psychological test whereas both have a large amount of physical endurance thrown in.<br /><br />I have already started the Death Cure to find out the rest of the underlying story behind the \\"variables\\" and the \\"flare\\" and how the story ends.
B004MARLJ2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It is has a nice art style and fun gameplay, while being just the right level of challenging without frustrating you.
0307595862|3.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the overall positive reviews.  The many characters and plot lines were hard to follow and the language was clunky and cliched (though I'm willing to accept that was a translation issue.)  The blatant sexism in the book really grated on me, and the Big Finale was so implausible it was almost silly.  Despite these negatives, it was a readable crime novel.  I'm not likely to read other books in the Harry Hole (good grief, what a name!) series.

B002HFWAWW|5.0|Great, small cast.  Cool story about an elite police officer in a dystopian society; helping to suppress individuality and emotion.  My favorite parts involve the dark tone of the movie as well as the choreographed fighting for the \\"Gunkata\\".  Thank you, Blockbuster clerk, for making this recommendation!  I eagerly awaited the writer/director's followup films-unfortunately, not in the same category (eg-Ultraviolet).  This is one of my favorites-I have watched it many times.  Can I also mention that Christian Bale, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs are not hard on the eyes?
B004EPYZXU|4.0|Okay, I just have to say from the start before I saw this movie I knew it'd be a \\"B\\" movie. We all knew that. But I am a huge fan of the ultra-creative horror picture of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and I think since this movie is very like that but almost a little better I think that this was a very creative and well done movie. People don't come into theaters anymore with an open mind and just not think about the movie and just enjoy the roller coaster ride for these kinds of movies.   The effects were amazing, the cinematography and the different camera shots were very well done, and the acting was much better than I thought, and the suspense and story was was great! I am amazed to how many people hated this movie...I found the movie pretty convincing as well...Even though it is fake it almost convinced me...
0446556750|4.0|\\"The Reversal\\" is Michael Connelly's twenty-second book and was first published in 2010. It's one of his all-star team-ups, featuring the LAPD's finest, Harry Bosch, and his half-brother, the lawyer Mickey Haller.   Haller has been earning his living as a defence attorney for more than twenty years, but finds himself in an unusual position at the book's beginning - summoned to lunch by LA's district attorney, Gabriel Williams. Mickey had no inkling of what was to come and so, when Williams asks him to switch sides and help prosecute a case, he immediately thinks he's the butt of a high-powered joke. Williams, however, is entirely serious. Twenty-four years earlier, Jason Jessup had been convicted of killing a twelve year old year girl called Melissa Landy. Ever since then, he's been campaigning to having his conviction overturned. Now, the Supreme Court have ordered the DA to either retry or release Jessup - DNA testing on stains found on Melissa's dress have indicated they came from someone else. Haller is therefore surprised that Williams is moving for a retrial - but Williams apparently believes they can win the case again. When Jessup had been tried before, DNA analysis wasn't used in court - so the stains had never been presented as evidence. The guilty verdict was reached on the strength of the other evidence available. Furthermore, Williams believes they have a way to 'neutralise' the current DNA argument. Mickey's very tempted and, after a little more convincing, agrees to take on the case. However, he doesn't make it too easy : his second has to be his ex-wife and current prosecutor, Maggie McFierce, and his invesitgator has to be LAPD detective Harry Bosch.   The focus of the book alternates between Haller and Bosch - with Haller telling his own story, and Bosch's story being written in the third person. Between the two, I'd still prefer Bosch as a character and \\"The Reversal\\" finds him in a slightly unusual position. Normally, he gathers the evidence on a'fresh' case which (in time) leads him to the killer. Here, he's reviewing an old case, where the suspect is well-known and the evidence is old, faded and (possibly) only part-remembered. There's also a difficulty in that some of the people involved with the original investigaton are no longer able to help - either through death or illness. However, he's a skilled investigator and he surprises the two lawyers at times with what he's able to turn up. I *do* miss the old-style Bosch books a little and I'm getting a little tired of all the team-ups - but a very enjoyable book overall, certainly worth reading.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.<br /><br />Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.<br /><br />For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.<br /><br />In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.<br /><br />The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.<br /><br />Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.<br /><br />In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for  young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.<br /><br />From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.<br /><br />The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.<br /><br />Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society.
B005AUWY90|3.0|Cars 2 is not that bad as it was projected when it was released. I had a sense from the reviews that the story isn't warm as the other movies of Pixar (re: Mater being put down by McQueen). However, this did not seem to be entirely true. This one has nicely written story, which values friendship indeed. Nevertheless, I cannot rate this as five stars as it lacks the identity of Pixar movies. Pixar has been known to be make extremely innovative, brilliant and highly entertaining animation flicks. Each time, Pixar just didn't make the movie, but actually created a whole new world and introduced an ultra-fresh concept and had been seldom repetitive. Take any flick from Monsters, Nemo, Cars, Incredibles to Wall E, every movie is as isolated as an island, yet remarkably brilliant and incredibly warm (humane). It's not an easy challenge to maintain. However, this is the exact thing gone missing in Cars 2. Without any innovation and depth, Cars 2 just remains a excellent animated movie, not a \\"Pixar\\" movie.   It is impossible not to compare this with original CARS, as it will not be judged by anyone as a standalone Pixar animated movie. Hence, here it is..   1. This one is more action-based than the first. The story resembles to a Bond movie, hence at times it appears as if the real actors are just given a 'car-face' to play. What I mean is, this movie isn't outstanding in terms of originality of animation, its more of a action movie plot played by animated characters.   2. The first one has better story and quality animation. Don't take me wrong, cars 2 animation is top-notch, but it's just an extension of the first one. However, I must give a standing ovation to the Tokyo, Italy and London they have created!   3. Cars 2 is waaay behind the original movie when it comes to real laughters. There is hardly any point where you will laugh aloud. Hence if you are considering this as a comedy option, just don't expect much.   4. Most characters are pulled from the original movie,this one has only one prominent character (mcmissile by Michael Cain), I couldn't think of any other.   All in all, Cars 2 is okay to see once, and it's perfectly fine to skip it if you love the original. It will not be too much to say that it's better to watch the first one twice than to spend a lot of money on this.
B005GSVFBE|2.0|I like very much this movie,but unfortunetly the 3D was a little disapointing,some effect in some scene but in general the 3D is very flat,if you buy this set for the blu ray 3D may be you will have regrets.
B000OVLINI|5.0|A friend of mine was dating a guy from Barcelona and said some disparaging things about his city. He sent me this book in the mail to set me straight. I read it and loved it. I always recommend this book. The relationship didn't last but my love for this book endures.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|Please do not waste your money on this case.  This has got to be the flimsiest cover I've ever come across for any tablet device I've owned.  The whole thing resembles cardboard spray-coated with some sort of rubberized paint and then partially covered with cheap felt (on the inside of the front cover only).  The front cover is supposed to fold back to create a stand but it just falls over.  The elastic strap is just glued in place - I bet that will last a whole week or so before it comes apart....  For the price that they were charging for this, I expected it to be much better quality than what it actually is.  I will be returning it tomorrow.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This book was a great read. Josh does a fantastic job of making the topic of memory into a very readable and interesting book. He puts in just the right amount of technical speak into the book without becoming a college text book, and the perfect amount information to help improve your own memory without becoming a self-help book. This book is probably the only book I've read on the topic that I didn't want  to put down.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|I've been a Megadeth fan for over 15 years...have all their cds...and, in my opinion, this is their best album since Youth.  I really liked Endgame and this one is even better.  A good mix of old and new.  I really didn't like the name of the album, but the songs are killer.  I especially love New World Order and Fast Lane.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|As a horror fan, I always look for something that is genuinely scary (not something that turns out to be ridiculous). As many others have pointed out, Insidious is one such authentic horror movie that has all the elements of classic horror and no nonsense. Here is a summary what it has- Texture-Perfect texture and tone for a horror. Dark, at times foggy atmosphere, quiet house, spooky attic, you name it, and the movie has it all. Acting- Realistic characters, not extremists (believer female v/s non-believer male). Everyone has played their role well. Music- One of the best for horrors. perfect timing, well-balanced highs and lows, and cool jolts. Story- Very conceivable story. Everything has been explained in the movie, so you don't end up in saying WT* at the end. Of all the horror movies I have seen so far, this is the first time I have seen this concept and I liked it(its not just a haunted house or a possessed body). The script supports the story well. The director has kept everything so cohesively,that the movie neither loses its grip, nor gets boring anywhere. Wonderful flow from beginning to end! There is only one drawback I felt. The fact that the evil creatures show up in the second half of the movie slightly dilutes the overall creeepy effect. I am sure it would have been a lot more spooky if they would have adapted the Paranormal activity style (where the fear originates mainly through your imagination, not because of a scary face). I think in today's era, with so much awareness about filmmaking and advanced technology in general, its obvious for everyone to imagine that the 'ghosts' are none but artists with appropriate makeup. Hence, shadows can scare you more than the actual guy standing right in front of you. That's the only point where the movie drops a little. However, considering the fact that the crew has managed to create an authentic horror flick using all the classical elements (minus all the nonsense that is generally seen in today's movies),Insidious deserves a big applaud. It's not easy to scare people living in 2011 with the old school elements of 70's, but this movie does it, and does it in an excellent way, without compromising on any of the vital elements of a horror flick. Although I like innovations like paranormal activity, I still like to see the classical (and genuine horror). Of all the movies I have seen recently, Insidious is definitely an instant classic of the genre. If you are a horror fan, this has to be in your collection.

1843106698|5.0|If I have any questions about autism, mostly asperger's, this is the first book I use.  Tony Attwood has amazing insight into autism with all the years of experience he has obtained.  There are not a lot of technical terms to confuse readers and he clearly explains his meaning.  The use of quotes from Hans Asperger at the beginning of each chapter are great to use for personal support for parents of children with autism.  It is a great way to help remind us that there are others in the world that are going through the same thing.  I have recommended this book to so many people and will continue to do so.  I hope to one day have the opportunity to see him and Temple Grandin speak at a conference.  Thank you, Dr. Attwood for sharing your vast amount of knowledge with the rest of us!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Every once in a while I read a book and crave another by that author. This was certainly one of them. It is not a book for those who don't like fantasy, or lush evocative descriptions of scenes. Those folks should wait and see the movie!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|when i picked up this book i thought this would be a mystery story of some kind. wrong.this is an amazing novel featuring violet klaus and sunny baudelaire. they are now orphanes in the world. when they get put into care of a nasty villian all he wants to do is steal their fortune and he will do whatever it takes to do so. overall this is a sad amazing novel
0553583182|3.0|If you're looking for a positive change, this book has some great practical tips built on science. The book is very inspirational and teaches you to tap into the power of the subconscious mind to instill long lasting changing. It has a lot of interesting thoughts that I hadn't ever entertained. For instance, I always thought that positive thinking creates an indirect change in the external world by effecting how we interact with the world. However, the author takes this a step further and states that the subconscious mind not only effect how we interact with the world, but has a direct effect on the external world. This requires the belief in a physical and psychical/spiritual realm. It gives new meaning to prayer as well because prayer effects objects directly, not necessarily through an external God.  So needless to say, I really enjoyed the book, as well as the authors philosophies. The only downside is that the book is very redundant. There were many reiterated points, not just restated in the same section, but different chapters. It almost gives you a deja vu effect. While reading I found myself wondering, didn't I read this already? Nonetheless, it's a great book and I recommend it.
B005HGKW6E|5.0|I saw this movie before its release in theatres and I spoke with Rob Stone (one of the producers) and I was blown away by the movie!  I think students everywhere should see it!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I started this book several days ago and have put work and personal life on hold because I haven't wanted to do anything but keep turning the pages.  And that is what this is--a page-turner.  This is so different from King's usual horror work (which I do love--at least the earlier work) but I do believe this is his finest book.    As usual, King is a masterful storyteller.  Plus he's a genius for thinking of great story angles that sound as though they would be completely unbelievable but he weaves the tale so well that they ARE completely believable.  And as usual, his character development is awesome.  One of the things I love most about King's writing is the marvelous depth he gives his characters.   This book is a perfect example of King's masterful storytelling.  First, you have a plot idea that sounds as though it won't work but it does work (if anyone but King tried it--but since it was him, I believed from the beginning that it would work).    One of the things I loved best about this book was all the little side stories along the way.  I don't want to say too much because of spoiling but there are little side stories that are almost as interesting as the primary plot of Jake trying to stop Oswald from killing Kennedy.  And speaking of Jake, he is a perfect example of King's ability to bring a character to life.  I know Jake--and I know he will stay with me long after I finish reading this book.  I so recommend this book!  One tip--I would definitely buy the Kindle version because this is a monster to walk around with.
0553801473|3.0|Ah, where to begin?  I'm going to try to focus on the actual book and leave the George R.R. Martin bashing to a minimum.  But I will say that this man has seemed to become the most ungrateful author I've ever stumbled across and apparently he just does not care that 'fans' like me, who've been there from the beginning are upset about his disregard for his own great story.  We feel betrayed.  Betrayed!  If you ever visit his website, all he does is whine about the people who can't wait to read his next book.  God, we are such jerks... After waiting 5 years for a book that was supposedly written at the same time as the last, but just made it too long for one book... I guess I have at least another 5 years for the next mediocre part of the story.<br /><br />Argh - I digress!<br /><br />And please note, I do not have direct spoilers, but I may let you know not to expect too much from certain character story arcs...<br /><br />The story is better than the last, A Feast for Crows, because at least things DO happen in this book.  For some characters.<br /><br />I actually did like the plot revolving around an old knight.  I love reading about the backstory from before the series begins.  You have great sympathy for this wayward knight who has kept his loyalties and friendship even after death.<br /><br />Bran has finally continued his adventure and met an interesting outcome.  Still not sure where this is going, but I enjoyed reading about him.<br /><br />Those were the two, and only two, highlights of this book.  Theon was interesting for a minute.  Dany is completely useless and annoying - not the girl-woman I've grown to admire and root for.  Jon is whiny, clueless as to why no one supports him, even though he asks for advice and does the exact opposite.  Tyrion is funny, as usual, but his part could have been cut off just like his nose.  The Martells make an appearance, leading to an interesting story....which fails to materialize; it was not that interesting.  Arya isin the exact same place doing the exact same thing as in AFFC.  I realize that these people have to get from A to B, and yes I want to know how, but I don't want to know EVERYTHING!  I felt like I was reading AFFC with different characters (note: this is NOT good).  It's like Martin is trying to make us dislike our favorite characters.  And not in the good exciting way he showed in the first three AMAZING books of the series where the good guys had flaws and the bad guys had their reasons and some just rightfully looked out for themselves.  No, it's like he is completely bored of them... His writing and his current personality trend almost make me wish he would just stop and I will finish it all up myself in my mind.<br /><br />Speaking of poor writing - the writing was horrible.  As you can see from my review, I'm no copy editor or author myself, but even I know drivel when I read it.  I was soooooo incredibly tired of hearing the phrases repeated throughout the book.  \\"He/She was not wrong\\" \\"As useless as Nipples on a breastplate\\" \\"Die with a smile upon her lips\\" \\"words are wind\\".  It's like the George R.R. Martin template.  These phrases were repeated three or more times, and when you note one, you note them all.  It was very distracting.<br /><br />Yes, Martin has decided his story his boring.  It's glaringly obvious.  What is not obvious is if he is so bored, why is he dragging the story out?  Not to mention - Has he learned nothing after Jordan's death just before the end of his story?  Does he have so little respect for his fans?<br /><br />I am giving this a 3/5 because it is most definitely worth the first read.  However, it will not be joining his five star first three books, which I've read repeatedly and marked parts or stories of interest; instead, it will be holding up my bed posts along with AFFC...

0762434279|5.0|For those who didn't have a rich dad or were raised in a family that didn't teach you how to invest or view money, Robert Kiyosaki is that \\"Rich Dad\\" that can give you the tools necessary to get out of the \\"rat race.\\" As a new graduate, I was clueless. My family isn't rich and my father never taught me how to view money or invest. All he taught me was to work hard, but then what? If that's where you find yourself, then this book is for you. It gives you the mindset necessary to not have to work hard for money but have your money work hard for you. Pick this up, buy for your new grad and then even go to his website richdad.com. I was so inspired by the book, I went there and started playing the cash flow game, which further ingrains the necessary ideology to get out of the rat race and make your money work for you.
0399250573|4.0|Wow. I read this after reading Snakehead, so there were mild spoilers for Crocodile tears, but that was expected. The beggingng has very little Alex, more Villain than anything, and as the title says, focuses on Scorpia. We learn more about the villinas in this one than an any other book. Alex seems to be manipulated so much easier in this book, but who can blame him. Blunt is shown to be retiring, and the CIA makes an entrance. Yeah! out of all his handles (Blunt, Brooke and Bryne) Bryne is the most fair to Alex. We find the return of a familiar vilian from book two, and this time, Jack Starbright is along for the ride.   Jack seemed a little off and awkward, but Alex was at his most emotional since the end of Snakehead, and Scorpia. It takes place in the Middle east, with less of the gadgets and cover story than normal, but he gets to stay with Smithers, and his angel cakes. My favorite characters returned for this book, i felt more could have been done with them, but it was still well done, and not a book that i would have ever skipped. The minute i finished it, i started it again. There is a major character death, i knew it was coming, so i avoided it, but it still hit me hard. The ending was really invetable, and it wasnt a fangirl ending, either. We all would have wanted him to secertly join a ninja top secerte group or something, but this really was the best way. One thing i would have wanted would have been Ben Daniels to return, or Alex to really realize his potentil. He is always poryaed as having great luck and cool gadgets, but really, Alex is good at what he does, and Horowits never acknoledges that. This was good though, with still a little smart-aleck alex running through it all.
0385535139|5.0|1) This was a great book - Great characters, great story, enough drama to keep me interested and a plot twist that I could see but couldn't figure out.  2) Great Characters - Finley and Figg leapt off the page.  I could see their seedy building, smell their cramped, dirty offices, feel the pain of decades of work and their desire for a big score.  I almost needed a nap after reading about David Zinc's Corporate work week. I wonder how many lawyers feel like David, but can't walk away.  3) I appreciated the battle and the plot twist.  About halfway though I felt like David was gaining valuable experience that he was going to use during the lead paint trial.  I waited for the first lawsuit to finish up and then I wanted to see the results of all that valuable experience.  With only a few pages left I was starting to doubt that the hero would pull out a magic lawsuit and be able help the Khaings.  I was pleasantly surprised to read the end where things worked out and all my questions were answered.  4)John Grisham did a great job with this.  It was well worth the cost of the book.  I read it all in one sitting and enjoyed it immensely.
1451627289|5.0|I do not believe in long reviews, and I do not believe in plot killers.  This book is a fascinating journey.  The pages turn themselves.  It is pure escapism, but then it is not.  Thoughts are provoked, philosophies are raised emotions are roused.  There are even some historic tid bits (regarding LHO) that are rarely known.  Everyone knows the premise of this book.  But the characters, the settings, the images.....this masterful writer makes them all so real that anyone above the age of 50 is reading and thinking.......\\"Oh yeah...I remember when that used to be the norm.  God I had almost forgotten that about tvs.\\"  The theme is a dream.....alas, just a dream.  But the writing - the writing is pure perfection.  I am a huge proponent of reading - it engages us and makes us think, it entertains us and makes us feel......and it does much more.  Especially when King is the storyteller.  Had Stephen King NOT been born, or not become a writer our collective imaginations and conversatoins would be far less vibrant.  BTW -  I bought my copy on Kindle.  And it is an \\"enhanced\\" version which means that a 13 minute video of Stephen King comes with your book.  But I wont be albe to tell you about that until I get my Kindle Fire.  Buy - Read - Enjoy
B000OVLBHG|3.0|I was left wishing plot and characters had as much time put into them as visual effects and general look of film. Not sure if the dialog and politics were on purpose or not, the movie can entertain but will not make you think much.

B001OQCV6A|1.0|I've been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, both in book form and on film, my entire life. The films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce didn't require special effects and blaring noise to hold their audience's interest.   Having read every book and seen every movie involving Holmes, I don't recall much in the way of gunplay or any other form of violence. The essence of Holmes was his brain....not his brawn, but you would never know if from this trash.  This piece of garbage may appeal to people who know nothing of the original stories and therefore might enjoy the overblown antics in which Holmes and Watson are involved. Frankly, this is one of the few movies I've ever paid admission to and walked out on. I do not own the DVD and would not accept it if it were given to me for free.  Obviously, a large profit was made on this film as there is a sequel to be released shortly. I now know enough not to waste my time and money on that one.
0446573019|4.0|1) I appreciated the story which was pretty solid, the work that went into making the characters real, the attention to detail for both the Army and CID data, and finally the extra effort to help me grasp the terrian.  Setting the book in West Virginia was interesting because I felt like you would really have to help me see the place in my mind.  I went their once and coal mining makes this state something that has to be seen in your eyes.  You have to see the terrain, smell the air, taste the water etc.  Baldacci did a nice job with this.  2) I appreciated the storyline of this \\"stranger in a strange land\\" book.  Why only one CID, how stretched were the county resources, the distances between two points on the map, the secret site the government left behind and the coal company.  I enjoy having data leap out at me to help me build the case in my mind.  This book does a nice job folding separate plots into a total story.  3) Anytime a nuclear device is involved it always makes things a bit sweaty.  Will it explode, what will the damage be like, how will they disarm it etc.  4)  I enjoyed the John and Sam characters.  I was sad that she didn't survive, although I bet it would have been like a Jack Reacher book where they would have been great for a week or two and then just faded away.  5) Nice job, worth the money
0385535139|5.0|I love the books that John Grisham writes concerning lawyers.  This is right up there with the best of the best.  I read this book in 2 settings as I found myself eager to find out what was going to happen to Finley, Figg, & Zinc.  The courtroom drama is great.  The twists and turns in the book regarding the characters is interesting as well.  This is definitely another all time hit for Grisham.  John Grisham's book, \\"The Confession\\" was also an excellent read.  Do not hesitate to purchase this book as you will thoroughly enjoy!
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|I bought this bought because of a review in the economist, but I was quite unimpressed with it. The premise of the book is ok, although not quite original. Computers becoming self aware and turning on their creators? been there done that. but I was mostly annoyed by the poor character development. Both the main character and his wife are very inconsistent in their thinking and their behaviour in my opinion and it just comes across as sloppy or lazy writing. I haven't read any other books by this author and to be honest I'm not really into fiction (last fiction book I read as years ago) so maybe it's me, not the book that was the problem. I finished it in about 6 hours so it's easy to read and doesn't require much thinking from the reader. if it s some holiday reading you're after, it will be ok but don't expect a intellectual challenge or a clever plot.

B005LAIGFK|5.0|J. EDGAR is a cinematic accomplishment of the first order! From the screenplay (Dustin Lance Black) as acted by a host of consummate actors and directed with extreme sensitivity by Clint Eastwood, the sum of the parts is an extraordinary achievement in presenting a portrait of one of the strangest men in history.  The manner in which the life and deeds and personality are woven together presents as full an image of a man of contradictions, a man who planned to have his personal files destroyed after his death in order to maintain the iconic image he so desperately desired, is nothing short of a work of dedicated investigation on parts of everyone involved.  And electing to tell this story through the ever-changing  chameleon aspects of this bizarre man by shifting from youth to old age in a constant parenthetical manner was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />The rise of young John Edgar Hoover from a mother-favored child, through the emotional conflicts this mother worship produced, through the sightings of incidents suggestive of early 'Bolshevik' interference/threat in this country that Hoover focused on in his usurping power as the head of the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation, provides a background from which we can observe the morphing of this obsessed man.  The act of staging press conferences around the Lindbergh case and the capture of the big criminals of the day were manipulated to give Hoover supreme power to investigate 'threatening people of interest' by wire taping, spying, etc. But all of this runs parallel to the personal story of Hoover's private sexual life.  From his living with his mother until her death, to his incompetent attempt to force himself on the woman who would be his secretary throughout his career, to his bonding with Clyde Tolson who he chose to be his assistant and never was far from his side, to his final hours when Tolson though suffering from the residuum of a stroke was the only person Hoover could trust as Richard Nixon planned his destruction.<br /><br />Each of the incidents that highlighted Hoover's long career as founder and head of the FBI is presented well, but it is the de-mystification of Hoover the vulnerable man beneath the tyrannical façade that makes this film so extremely powerful. That is due to the script and the direction, of course, but it is also due in large part to the brilliant portrayal of this enigmatic beast of a pathetic man by Leonardo DiCaprio: he remains credible throughout and moves through the aging process and intermittent flashbacks to his younger days with complete ease and credibility.  Likewise the performances of Judi Dench as his strange mother ('I'd rather my son be dead than be a daffodil' - her term for 'gay'), of Naomi Watts as his secretary who thwarts Hoover's initial awkward physical advances to become his lifelong supporter, and of Armie Hammer as Hoover's love interest Clyde Tolson acted with such a full range of emotion and subtlety that he is completely credible - these key roles are all of Oscar caliber as supporting roles.<br /><br />Eastwood's careful casting of actors for the roles of Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas), Eisenhower (Gunner Wright), Franklin Roosevelt (David A. Cooper), Harlan Fiske Stone (Ken Howard), Robert Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan), Colonel Schwarzkopf (Dermot Mulroney), Bruno Hauptmann (Damon Herriman), Richard Nixon (Christopher Shyer), and Haldeman (Larkin Campbell) gives the audience the opportunity to catch glimpses of the people influenced by Hoover without stooping to caricatures.<br /><br />But in the end it is the slow dissection of the relationship between Hoover and Tolson that is the most powerful element of this film.  The audience is left with little doubt that these men were, in truth,  lovers without the expected obvious stereotypical activities and conversations.  It is an act of greatness on the parts of all involved, and for this reason probably more than any other aspect of this huge film, this biopic deserves to be in the lineup for Best Picture of the Year.

B000003TAR|5.0|Well, the album contains some classics as rape me and heart shape box. I liked  and indicate the product to a friend.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I've gotten to three of the endings and I can hardly put this game down. Regardless of what the title may make you think, this is not a game that is finished in 9 hours! Thank goodness, because it's so enjoyable that I will be sad to finish it.<br /><br />Graphically, this game gets good marks. As far as the DS is concerned, animations can often be poor. The sprites we see in the game are well done, and the backgrounds are delightful. The investigation periods are perfect as you can see all the possible investigable items easily (and touch them, but a stylus is highly recommended for that part--the game does warn you of this, too). It's also laudable that the game's mechanics allow you to skip past parts you've experienced already in a previous playthrough  by holding down the right directional button. This is a total plus.<br /><br />An important thing to note is that the game is not to be played in a dark lonely room (unless you're into that sort of thing...). It can be rather scary at times, and you could easily say that the descriptions sometimes lean towards horrifying. There is a lot of thought put into the dialogue and it in turn evokes a lot of thought-- if you were looking for a fun investigating game, I might recommend the Professor Layton games or something more like that, as this game is most certainly for adults and deals with adult topics. If you didn't notice...M rated for a reason.<br /><br />A particularly interesting aspect of this game is the use of numbers. 999 does use the Hexadecimal system often, and there are some situations where being able to figure out the answer to a number problem is really, really hard. I have a brother who is an engineer, and even he struggled over one puzzle (for those who have played, it was the cargo room's pin puzzle, with the F on top...we looked it up after an hour >.&lt;). That said, there are great references online for those who don't want the game spoiled for them (trust me, you don't want to read ahead on this plot), and I know of at least one puzzle guide that has no spoilers for the plot. Another notable thing is the sound in the game. There is a lot of ambient effects. There is this one weird sound whenever the character Zero is mentioned at the start that gets me every time...<br /><br />What's important to know before you buy the game, is that 999 is a visual novel. Yes, you have near total control over your story's results. Yes, there are sections where you lead the player character entirely. However, this is a text intensive game. You wont want distractions! I'd personally recommend this for the person in your life who you want to read more--999 is a perfect blend of story, intrigue, and imagery--at least, as long as they like scarier things!<br /><br />Overall, I'd call this game a must-buy. It's even better than I expected it to be, and I had high hopes from the start.one puzzle guide that has no spoilers for the plot. Another notable thing is the sound in the game.

B005NS0VNU|2.0|Other than the fact that \\"Hey, it's nice to have both IRS and WB material on one cd\\" there really isn't a point to this collection.  R.E.M. never was a band with hit singles so it makes no sense to package a greatest hits of material.  These guys aren't the Bee Gees.  Almost all the songs have been covered on the IRS Years and WB \\"Best of\\" so I say again, what's the point?  This would have been a great opportunity to do more of a retrospective that could have featured a greater range of songs.  Do we really need \\"Shiny Happy People?\\"  No.  Do we need \\"Stand?\\" No.  Then you get to the craziness of this collection that includes \\"Sidewinder\\" from Automatic but not \\"Drive?\\"  This is just the kind of release that makes an R.E.M. fan shutter in the absurdity.
B004EPZ07U|1.0|Okay, first up, the movie gets 3 1/2 stars.  The only reason I watched this movie is because I loved GL when I was a kid and now my son wants to see it, so go figure.  As far as the movie goes, it all boils down to super intelligent aliens who couldn't figure out something that was so simple.  Now down to the Ultraviolet business.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the way the traditional Digital Copy was working for everybody.  If something so simple gets way too complicated, I recommend not doing it anymore.  I believe the majority has spoken; just scrap the Ultraviolet idea.  I dunno, maybe it was Abin Sur's idea in the first place. His skin seemed \\"ultraviolet\\" to me.   Maybe it should have died with him.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The transfer to blu-ray looks great and lucasfilm did a nice job at adding some special features. Unfortunately Lucas can not stop messing with the original trilogy so yet again he's messed around with the original films. All of this would be fine if there was another disc with the original films shown in theaters. Until then I will have to keep my laserdisc player around to watch the THX versions of the original theatrical release.
B00023B1LC|4.0|I am 62 years old, a movie fanatic my entire life, big fan of action/suspense. I'm not a professional film critic, but among my main criteria for enjoying a film is that it must have an interesting story and characters, AND I find that if I want to watch the film over again.....and again, then it is a good movie. This is a popular, widely-seen film, and I would have to say that it is one of THE greatest action films ever made. It almost has too much action; it verges on the edge of being one of those roller-coaster movies made for people who have short attention spans. It also has a tad too much exposition for my tastes: I don't need the filmmakers to dot every \\"i\\" for me; I can figure things out. A further quibble is the amnesia thing, a hoary old device used in really bad TV shows by lazy writers. But the two leads are a great couple and there is much chemistry. Doug Liman does a fantastic directing job here; too bad he did not helm the later installments, which I found almost unwatchable because of all the shaking cameras and split-second cuts. When movies are cut like that, you can make anyone look like an action hero.<br />This movie is better than 90% of the Bond films out there, a great and entertaining thriller.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This movie is awesome, but don't waste your money with the combo pack.  The digital copy isn't really a digital copy at all.  It doesn't work with any devices unless you download their specific software which is a pain!  It is false advertising in my opinion, because digital copy has become synonamous with iTunes or Windows Media Player.  This works with NEITHER!
B001R0O9K4|2.0|Collins is nothing more than an early version of Che Guevera. As his legacy he leaves IRA terrorism which is arguably the prototype for today's world problems. Why does the movie industry insist on glorifying these people? I say good riddance.

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I just played the crap out of this game. It's beautiful and easy to pick up and play.  I do wish there were some guides out there.  Some collectibles (gems) I'd like to find.  I only have Sapphire left, and I have no idea where it's hiding.  Still, probably the greatest game I've played on my Vibrant/Galaxy S.
1451629184|5.0|I've completed Jaycee's memoir just now.  It is a book of light that overpowers dark.  It is a testament of spirit that exists and eventually triumphs over the extinguisher.  I'm glad to have read this proof of survival despite insane odds.  There is a power that resonates at full volume among survivors, no matter how quiet or shy.  I know that Jaycee will become more assertive and anything else she aims for--in her own pace and timing.  Though she matured in the company of idiots, Jaycee's sanity and calm stayed with her throughout.<br /><br />Mostly written in the present tense, Jaycee's memoir recounts her imprisonment.  Structure in this book assumes the roles of the candles in one of her therapy sessions: 3 candles for past, present, and future.  The candle for the past burns down most as she tells her past openly to readers.  The present consists of \\"Reflection\\" sections where she pauses in telling of the past to catch up to her current perspective on the past matter.  The future candle in the therapy session burned brightest when looked at; the same is true for the tone in this book.  Any reader should be able to see how Jaycee's optimism is one of many outstanding attributes.<br /><br />The scenes and stages often seem more nightmare than real, never flinching or holding back.  This book is vivid in the narrative, which I find every choice of the author's not only gutsy but fitting and appropriate.  Aware of the needs of subject matter delivery, Jaycee shows she already is a writer--something she wanted to be as a child.  Stubbornness, which she mentions exhibiting as a child, still shows in her personality after all.  If books had ratings, this book is rated X.  That also makes perfect sense and only fits the subject.  If a reader is apt to say something is \\"too graphic\\" for their tastes, think on it before you buy.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|Many folks have raised the issue, but this isn't your typical digital copy of a movie.  You can't download it to your computer and use it on an iPad or phone.  You have to sign up for an account and install their software just to download and play the movie.  My problem was that I pre-ordered this movie a couple of months ago.  I don't recall seeing UltraViolet mentioned and I don't recall any mention of the process necessary to actually download the movie when I ordered.  Maybe they did, but I think Amazon should have a clear warning since this is SO different from what most people think of as a digital copy.  If I knew then what I know now, I never would have ordered it.  Now that I've had this experience, I doubt I will ever order a movie with a digital copy through Amazon again.
B0053KWDES|3.0|I purchased this to be used with an android phone and laptop. It does have a good size and look. It also has static when volume is low-slight crackling. I also do not like that it will turn off if plugged in. This means if the battery is low and you are close to a laptop or using it with your laptop, you can not charge it and use it at the same time. The sound Quality is diffidently better even at low volumes when using it. I am using it with a G2 and Monster Turbine Coppers.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The music is very relaxing. It has a fun and simple gameplay to feed a hungry creature. Such a cute game!
B005POK858|1.0|This game I'd slow with all the dialog you have to read, making it boring. Also, there us no exit, you have to return to home and use a task manager to STOP it from running.
B001HZSF2W|3.0|I am really enjoying the book. Obviously, some parts I have to breeze right over because it is not applicable to my current circumstances, but the book will be great to have around if I ever need a source to review in emergencies. Zombie apocaplyse? Nah, probably not, but there are tons of good survival tactics for other uses. Sometimes when Max is talking about \\"ghouls\\" or \\"undead,\\" my mind will switch those words with enemy soldiers.   And as for that buy instantly button. WATCH YOURSELF! That thing is dangerous!
0385732554|4.0|A few people put this book down on comparisons to 1984. Well nothing has and nothing will touch 1984,that's for sure. But that aside this is a good book, it's nicely written.  What grabbed me about the story is the lack of thought within the community. The communist lifestyle they lead restricts free thought and one has only a few objectives which never change throughout your life, it seems bleak. But the amazing or crazy thing is no-one cares, everyone basically gets on with things in a peaceful manner.  In comparing this book to the present day of Western society we would presume we have more freedom, and in a sense we do. But really the freedoms most people have today are for material things. We have freedom to choose which TV you want to buy, hundreds of TV channels to choose from, supermarkets have foods from all corners of the worldand many types of fast food restaurants etc. This has no spiritual meaning what so ever, it's just stuff. Some parts of the world still live within the rules of nature and with limited resources.  Do we have a choice on the way we want our governments to manage us? Well as far as I'm concerned, no!!! We will consume until there is nothing left to consume.  The Giver looks at a pòosible other life, which seems more sustainable but less exciting. We in the West are at the other end of the scale as we are not living sustainable lives. We also live in a world of debt where if you collected all the money there is in the world we still couldn't pay of the debt!!!  We do have one thing in common with the book and that is that we both are leading scary lives, one of consumption and one of near minimal consumption. It makes you think. This is the sign of a good book, there may be better out there but I would def recommend it.

1609611543|5.0|I couldn't put the book down when it came. Dr. Davis explains about wheat, gluten and what effect it has on your body.  The history he gives about our modern day wheat is enlightening. His explanations about the pitfalls of gluten free products and their ingredients were eyeopening.  I understand now, why when I started using gluten free products I started gaining weight.  His diet menu is basic and looks reasonably easy to follow.  I wish more doctors would read this and get educated on this topic.

B005LMEB8E|5.0|I never really heard much of Demi Lovato's music until Skyscraper came out and wanted to hear more.  I honestly wasn't expecting much from this album but was pleasently surprised when I gave it a listen.  It's a young pop sounding album as you would expect but with solid production and well written songs.  I like that it has a positive message in some songs, but also fun party songs so it's a nice balance of both.  This is a good album and I look forward to hearing more...
B00005RYKV|5.0|in my opinion, anything takeshi kitano does is remarkable. this movie is no different. for kitanos first movie here in the u.s., it delivers. there are gr8 action moments, suspence, and funny moments. and takeshi's way of positioning the camera is just as great. i recommend this to any yakuza fan out there. i still watch this often 2day and still enjoy it as much as the 1st time.
0553582038|5.0|I've been mesmerized by this series. Very hard to put down once started. I also enjoy the format. Each chapter concentrates on one character and his or her place in the action. Will be starting book 5 soon. Can't wait!
1451627289|5.0|Just finished the book - - it was hard to put down. Great story, terrific writing. I loved the characters, the plot line, and just about everything else about it. Kudos Stephen King!
0307454541|2.0|This book is entertaining but it was poorly written and full of cliches.  The mystery reminded me of a very similar Ruth Rendell novel I had read many years ago about a cold case about a missing girl and the outcome was very similar in that novel as in this one.  This is not literature, but it might be an entertaining read for a plane ride or on a beach.
B003AKLFAG|3.0|this movie in my opinion was crazy, but even crazier and so unexpected to me was the ending!!!! it had me shocked!!! if u can handle the dark tones this movie has, see it...or just see it 4 the ending.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The `Extended Cut' is 17 minutes longer and to me these minutes are a definite improvement on the `Theatrical Cut' and I must admit that Sucker Punch looks great on Blu-Ray!    This film seems to have had a polarizing effect, a lot like Marmite, you either love it or hate it.  I go with the former and I must admit I really don't understand why it has been mauled by most professional critics.    A hormonal teenager may just see the film as fetishly dressed `hot chicks' going from one video game fantasy setting to another and generally kicking a lot of ass along the way but I'd like to think that most adults would see through this sugar coating to reveal the bitter pill underneath.  Truth is that this is a dark and downbeat film.  Don't expect any happy endings here.    I enjoyed the fight sequences (which I've analysed below). Visually they are a treat with a real sense of scale and grandeur (especially the trenches of the First World War). I have to say that the futuristic bullet train sequence has the films most poignant moment by far.  The soundtrack is pretty good too. `White Rabbit' (sung here by Emilíana Torrini) and used during `The Trenches' scene was an audio and visual tour de force.  The `Maximum Movie Mode' extra is worth checking out.  For those that don't know it's just like director commentary but more interactive.  So Zack Snyder talks for a bit, then lets certain scenes play out and then at certain intervals there is the option to view galleries of stills of things like weapons, film sets and conceptual art &c. Storyboards are sometimes shown on screen against the actual final cut of the film as well.  *****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*****  `Sweet Pea'  `Sweet Pea' is the THE protagonist of the story.  It IS HER story. `Sweet Pea' is a very troubled girl who has Multiple Personality Disorder brought on by the death of her mother, little sister and primarily by long term (but only implied) physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her step-father. `Amber',`Blondie', `Rocket' and `Babydoll' are all parts of her multiple personality that take the form of the likeness of four other asylum inmates.  `BabyDoll's' Dances  When `Sweet Pea' (again in her alter as `BabyDoll') dances, she isn't actually dancing for men, she is undergoing therapy with Dr Gorski.  It is clear that Gorski uses music as a tool of her trade.  The music is used to relax `BabyDoll' in order to get into the state where she is `comfortable' about talking about her past and issues.  You will note that in her first dance, she is nervous and unwilling but as her therapy progresses `BabyDoll' ends up more than willing.  From `BabyDoll's' point of view, through the music she is re-imagining herself as an erotic dancer who provides `extra's' as this puts her in control of her sexuality and body as a willing and consensual participant (although to me this is still a delusion because she is still being used by men). Of course in reality, this was never the case.  The Bordello  This directly relates to `BabyDoll's' (who of course is an alter of `Sweet Pea's) dances.  Through her therapy `BabyDoll' sees herself as an erotic dancer who works in a high class club/brothel.  The Asylum takes the form of this very club/brothel with `Blue' (a fairly lowly orderly in real life) as the club owner/pimp/gangster that controls all of the dancers (who of course in real life are the inmates).  The reality of the situation however is that `Blue' is not in charge in the real world (it is in fact Dr Gorski) but to many of the inmates who suffer abuse at the hands of him and his colleagues, he very much is in charge.  The extensive use of mirrors in these sequences is telling us all not to trust what we see.  Dr Gorski  She is the most powerful female figure in this film and like `Sweet Pea's' mother and the mother Dragon, Dr Gorski doesn't realise what is going on under her nose and act upon it until it is far too late. `BabyDoll' only ever sees her as part of the problem. Shesees Gorski as the `dance teacher' of the club/brothel who is controlled by `Blue' and by this association that she must know what is going on and therefore is complicit in the use and abuse of the girls.  In the real world it is only when she finds out that `Blue' has been forging her signature that she then decides that something is very wrong and so she takes action in bringing in the Police to arrest `Blue'.  It is history repeating itself for `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll'.  Just as her mother failed her, so did Dr Gorski.  `BabyDoll's' Weapons  The Katana (more commonly but erroneously called a `Samurai sword') is not only an archaic, bloodthirsty and elegant looking weapon but it is also a phallic symbol.  The sword represents war, aggression and power.  Here `BabyDoll' uses this very personification of masculinity against enemy hordes that take the form of the masculine.  Swords are now mostly symbols of the human past or physical figments of legend, fantasy or myth and so it is of no surprise that `BabyDoll' uses one in her imagination.  The Gun is also a phallic symbol which is all about control and power. It also symbolises aggressiveness, anger and bad feelings.  At the beginning of the film she tries to shoot her step-father but fails miserably.  She certainly doesn't have this problem within her `dream sequences'.  This is her over compensating and righting that wrong in her own mind.  The Katana is actually etched with symbols that tell us the films story and the Gun has similar icons and symbols relevant to her plight but you can find more about that on the `Maximum Movie Mode' extra.  `BabyDoll's' Costume  Her outfit is that of a `Cute' Japanese High School girl.  Over 60 percent of all pornography in Japan depicts school girl related fantasies and about 40 percent of it depicts the sexual assault of these school girls. It is by far the most common sexual fantasy of Japanese men.  Japanese school girls wear their uniforms a lot outside of school hours and even on non-school days.  This is because the uniform is a cherished symbol of their childhood and innocence which they want to wear for as much time as possible before they leave school and have to `grow up'.  This then is the dual meaning/appeal that the uniform has in real life as well as this film.  Note: The other costumes obviously share a similar `sexual fantasy' element.  For instance, `Rocket's' uniform is that of a nurse.  The `nurse' fantasy is a common one and has been used extensively in American porn films.  The `Wise Man/General/Bus Driver'  This is `Sweet Pea's spiritual guide.  He looks like a grandfather figure and in dreams grandfathers represent wisdom and experience. Here `Sweet Pea' is therefore remembering her own grandfather and so the `Wise Man' takes on his likeness.  At the end he is also appears to be `Sweet Pea's' guardian angel (as he helps her evade the police and get on the bus bound for Fort Wayne).  It is also interesting to note that Fort Wayne, Indiana is named after General `Mad' Anthony Wayne of the Continental Army and that after the 1982 floods there, Fort Wayne was referred to `The City that saved itself'.  The Fight Sequences  Feudal Warriors  Here is where `Sweat Pea' (in her alter as `Babydoll') has to defeat three over-sized demonic samurai warriors. I believe this to be `Sweet Pea' realising that in order to get better, she needs to exorcise her massive demons (hence the size of the warriors).  It is also here where `Babydoll', who in fact is a personification of `Sweet Pea's' will is given her weapons by the `Wise Man', the very weapons that could set her free.  The tranquillity of the Shinto Temple and its immediate environment not only represents what should be a safe haven for her (the Asylum) but also the calm before the storm that will play out in her fractured mind. The destruction of the Temple in the sequence symbolises the state of her mind.  The Trenches  The briefing of the girls by the `General' (aka `Wise Man') takes place in the ruins of a Cathedral. This probably represents both the state of `Sweet Pea's' mind, ergo a bit of a wreck and also that what should have been another safe and sacrosanct place has been deliberately targeted and destroyed. This is a metaphor for her home where she was abused and the asylum where she is also being abused.  It may also symbolise her loss of faith in God - What sort of God allows girls to be sexually abused?  The mission is to steal a map showing detailed German troop formations along the front line.  This of course directly mirrors the plan to steal the map of the Asylum from `Blue's' office which shows not only the exits but where the security guards/checkpoints are located.  This is also the first time we see all of the `girls' fighting together. The `Wise Man' therefore advises the girls to \\"try and work together\\".  This is `Sweet Pea' realising that to regain her sanity and freedom she needs the parts of her multiple personality to merge into one.  The chaos and carnage on the battlefield and in the sky above it represent the conflicts going on in her head.  During this mission `Sweet Pea' saves her sister `Rocket' from certain death, something which she did not do in real life.  This shows that `Sweet Pea' hasn't let go of her little sister and the guilt that she has for her death.    There is a scene in the trench where `Blondie' lifts the helmet of a British soldier to reveal a traumatised looking teenage boy.  `Sweet Pea' looks briefly at the boy and then looks down and away.  This is `Sweet Pea' acknowledging that `boys' are also used and abused by men and are victims too.    Dragon  The scene represents the issues that `Sweet Pea' has with her deceased mother.  The killing of the baby dragon within the fantasy sequence represents the sacrifice of an innocent for a greater cause but for `Sweet Pea' it also represents her childhood and innocence being taken away from her by her abusive step-father under the nose and roof of her mother.    In the briefing, the `Wise Man' instructs the girls `not to wake the mother dragon'.  This makes a lot of sense within the context of the fantasy sequence but in the real world I think it has more sinister connotations as this is `Sweet Pea' recalling the sort of thing her step-father would say to her before he abused her while his wife/her mother slept. It is also a warning about what might happen if `Blue' finds out about her plans. The death of the baby dragon whilst its mother slept symbolises the abject failure of `Sweet Pea's' mother to protect her from being abused by her step-father.    The killing of the mother dragon represents not only the death of her mother but also of `Sweet Pea' punishing her for not protecting her in the first place and for turning a blind eye once she `woke up' and was aware of the abuse visited upon her eldest daughter. `Sweet Pea' therefore cannot forgive her mother for what she didn't do back then and for what has happened to her ever since.  I think `Sweet Pea' blames her mother more than her step-father for the abuse she has suffered and for the situation she currently finds herself in.  It makes me wonder whether `Sweet Pea' is also directly responsible for her mother's death in some way.  Distant Planet  This is the only mission that the girls fail. The scene itself is a metaphor for `Sweet Pea's' impending lobotomy. After the procedure `Sweet Pea' will look like she's `on a distant planet' and mentally she will `be on a distant planet'. The futuristic city represents `Sweet Pea's' brain, the bomb on the train represents the fact that time is literally running out for her and the train itself represents the Orbitoclast that the Doctor will use to strike her brain.  In this action sequence her sister `Rocket' dies (as she did in real life).  This is `Sweet Pea' realising that her sister is really gone and that there is nothing she can do about it. This is `Sweet Pea' finally letting her beloved sister go. At this point `Sweet Pea' realises that there is only one escape route for her now.  The `escape' and `lobotomy'  `Sweet Pea' only escapes the asylum/brothel in her own mind.  In reality another inmate escaped.  Dr Gorski tells the Doctor that has just undertaken `BabyDolls' lobotomy that (paraphrasing here) \\"she started a fire, stabbed an orderly and helped an inmate escape\\".  So in real life `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' did indeed start a fire, stab `Blue' and helped an inmate escape. `Helped' is a key word here.  It was never `Sweet Pea's' intention to physically leave the asylum as she was too vulnerable and unstable to survive out there and live anything like a normal life.  The whole `BabyDoll' creating a distraction for `Sweet Pea' to escape thing is `Sweet Pea' literally giving up, losing her will to resist her lobotomy.  Now I am not sure whether in the real world `Sweet Pea' did actually work in tandem with the unseen inmate that escaped or whether she just had a bit of a psychotic episode which in all the chaos that followed this, it allowed another inmate to escape.  The sex scene with the `High Roller' (who in real life is the Doctor) I believe is two things.  The first is her `deflowering'.  Deflowering here in the sense of her being lobotomised as he is taking away everything that makes her the (very troubled) person she is. So he wants to be sure that she actually wants it.  Of course `he' wanting to make sure is just `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll's mind accepting its fate. The second is what you see on screen. Therefore, `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' imagining what it would be like to actually have consensual sex with a man, or in more flowery terms `to make love'.  Something that she has never experienced (only sexual abuse) and something that in her lobotomised reality she will never feel or experience.  Finally, `Sweet Pea' getting on that bus and it driving off down a straight road, in a rather bland environment is `Sweet Pea/BabyDoll' in her new lobotomised state.  This is her `freedom'.  Well, that is my take on it.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This case is functional, providing lightweight protection while giving access to the USB port, power button, earphone jack, and leaving the speakers open. My main concerns are that the cover feels flimsy and the \\"stand\\" functionality is not very stable.<br /><br />I had initially rated this lower but with using it for a while now and the recent price drop, it is not a bad option but will looking for a better cover in the near future.<br /><br />CFH
B000803CVG|5.0|In 1988, Prince was in the process of recording what is now known as \\"The Black Album\\" as his follow-up to \\"Sign O The Times\\". He one day felt that it would be spiritually wrong to release the \\"Black Album\\" at all and only kept one song from it and instead recorded this lovely album \\"Lovesexy\\". There is a spiritual vibe but it's one that's incredibly inviting.<br /><br />The album is all in 1 track (unless you can find a version where they track all 9 songs). By being 1 45 minute track, it gives it even more of an enchanting quality; it might be a hassle to some, but every song is great in it's own right.<br /><br />My copy of this album skips at the half-way point and I'm going to buy another copy in the not-to distant future. That should indicate to you how much I think of this album.<br /><br />Any fan of Prince should own this and even people new to Prince could appreciate at least some of whats on here. Buy it.

0525423656|2.0|Overall I am disappointed with this book after liking the first one. After creating such a specific dystopian society, it crumbled a bit here. Minor things like Cassia mentioning angels when no one has really explained to her what they are (unless I forgot this somewhere in the first book). And somehow managing almost 400 pages where pretty much nothing happens. The switching povs felt forced to me, like Condie was unable to carry this book with Cassia alone. It also kept confusing me since the voices are SO similar. I didn't feel the connection between Cassia and Ky either as I did in the first book. And it just feels like it keeps trying too hard to provoke strife between the relationship and try to force a two boys one girl thing cause that's all the rage now.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Okay, the movie in itself is great. What isn't? Ultraviolet, at least the way it is right now. People seem to think that it's a scam and that's because the way the company presents it. Its confusing because it seems like they are only allowing the purchaser to stream and download for three years and thats it. Far from the truth. The three years is only for the streaming and here is why: you will be streaming from Ultraviolet/Flixster, just like Netflix users stream from Netflix, and, like Netflix, Ultraviolet has to pay for bandwidth, you will have to use data plan if you are streaming from your phone or pad but that's your deal, unless of course you are using wifi. So they are letting purchasers stream the movie at no extra charge. After that, if you still want streaming they will charge an extra fee because of the bandwidth. When you stream it takes up no space on your hard drive so that is an advantage, but the space must be taken up somewhere, hence bandwidth. So the streaming is for three years, not the download.  The download portion is for you to keep, forever. Once you download it you will be able put it on a flash drive or burn it to a disc and play it up to 12 computers at a time. Yes, it involves the flixster collection app, which is free. Flixster now allows people with smartphone and the ability to download the Flixster app to stream AND download their digital copy to their smartphones, making that advantageous over iTunes and Amazon because only people with an iPod touch, iPhone, or Android (and other smartphones with the ability to use amazon or iTunes) could play their digital copy anywhere. Now  other smartphones can as well. The other advantage is that the memory space isn't as much on a smartphone, because the space needed on a phone or touch is smaller than a computer. So the download is yours forever.  In your ultraviolet account you can have more than one person on your account. No need to \\"authorize\\" a computer anymore. Ultraviolet also uses acloud and, unlike Apple, the cloud has your digital copy, so if anything goes wrong you don't have to worry, well there has been some issues as I have read so hopefully those issues get fixed. iTunes does not have your digital copy in their cloud, and I know because I am constantly worried that I would lose them. I almost did once and iTunes did nothing to help me, luckily it was in my iPod's memory.  I purchased the 3D versions from Best Buy, Part 1's 3D transfer is not great but it does give it a different feel and I like it, when I looked at the ultraviolet I was skeptical. I already had the Green Lantern and I was frustrated with the change, I had problems with starting an account etc. etc., but the problem finally got fixed a day or two later. I RESEARCHED the intentions of Ultraviolet and now I am sold. However, sadly people don't like change. Please take a moment to research before you get all these ideas that it's trying to make things harder for the buyer. The only two things ultraviolet did wrong was not make themselves much clearer and there is no capability to remove movies from your smartphone other than deleting the app but that will delete your entire collection and you would have to download them again. I believe that Ultraviolet is better than iTunes or amazon. Well, at least it would be better for not the word of mouth. So try it and read before you judge. Ultraviolet is actually a great idea.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I am not giving this one star because of the movie itself. The Movie is a great conclusion to the series. I highly recommend it.  No, like the others I am reading here I am giving this one star because of the so called digital copy that is supposed to be included.   I didn't know what an Ultraviolet digital copy was when I ordered this, and if I had I wouldn't have ordered this edition. I would have gotten a less expensive edition without the digital copy.  I like digital copies for one reason. So I can watch movies when I travel. You know, like on a plane, where I don't have an internet connection. Or in places where I don't have access to a wifi hot spot but don't want to waste my limited data allotment.  No, to me a digital copy is a copy you actually have ON YOUR COMPUTER OR DEVICE. One that you can watch anywhere. Despite that in the description they say that Ultraviolet can be watched anywhere that isn't true. It can only be watched anywhere you have access to the internet. On a plane without internet service? Out of luck. Don't have 3G on your tablet and not near a hotspot? Out of luck. Out of data on your dataplan for the month? Out of luck.  I will NEVER buy another movie that \\"comes\\" with an ultraviolet copy. If it isn't a copy that I can actually download onto my devices then it isn't worth it, and I am not going to ever spend another cent for this so called extra.  I wish I had read through all these reviews before I purchased this.
B000002KMV|5.0|The word controversy sums this album up very well because Prince's lyrics don't hold back on any subject. Probably a response to the talk about his prior album \\"Dirty Mind\\", this whole thing works very well without pushing too much and becoming pretentious.<br /><br />On \\"Controversy\\", there are elements of his last album \\"Dirty Mind\\" that can still be heard but at the same time it shows where he was about to go with \\"1999\\" at times. To pigeonhole the genres and sound of this album would be a waste of time because Prince is a master of changing musical style on a whim.<br /><br />What I would say is that \\"Controversy\\" is a young Prince on the brink of super-stardom, only giving a taste of how unpredictable he could be (and how there were no boundaries he wouldn't cross given it didn't cross his own boundaries).<br /><br />Bottom line: Great album and I think you should purchase it if you're a Prince fan. If you've never heard Prince, I know this sounds cliche but \\"Purple Rain\\" is probably where you should start.

B0061IMJBI|4.0|I recently borrowed the graphic novels from a friend and have to say that this series is significantly more interesting as a live-action show. The characters (at least the male characters) are complex and the dialogue is artful. I wish there was at least one female character who wasn't perpetually the hand-wringing victim, but every scene with the character Daryl gets me riveted. The problem with this kind of story as a series for me is that I wonder how long I can suspend disbelief. Already I want to know why rotting corpses don't eventually decompose to a point of uselessness to the host virus. The zombie population should be diminishing, shouldn't it? But all that aside, exploring what the rules of survival should be after civilization crumbles is pretty good stuff. Norman Reedus...you are what other actors wish they could be.
B005OCFHHK|1.0|\\"Harry Potter: The Complete Collection\\" seems to imply that this 'collection' is COMPLETE. Far from it. This is a bare bones set with only the 8 films. No extended cuts or special features to speak of.   At least the Lord of the Rings Theatrical set included some featurettes. And then a year later the Extended set was released. These sets happen to be published by Warner, which also manages Potter. See what's going on here? They are trying to rake in money by releasing rubbish collections first with the good one later on.  Warner Brothers even had the gall to have released a trailer for the \\"Harry Potter: The Definitive Collection\\" before this set even hit stores.  Please, don't buy this set with a better one on the horizon.

0312611692|2.0|In typical Stanford professor style, Ian Morris has written a book that is much too detailed to be of any real value and which, by trying to say everything (645 pages), essentially says nothing. Professor Morris, who is an archaeologist and historian, claims that to really understand what the future will hold we have to go back all the way to pre-history and trace seemingly every event from then up to the present. He also claims that ultimately it is geography that makes the difference.  He develops a social development scale and uses this device to follow the human race, dividing the world into the West (Europe and what he calls \\"Southwest Asia\\" refusing to accept the convention \\"Middle East\\") and the East which is largely China.  Over time we see the West start out in the lead, the East catch up and go ahead and then the West regain the lead. Now says the good professor, the East is about to take over again. Morris also seems to discredit the \\"Great Man\\" view of history, namely that history is largely the result of the actions of certain men (and a few women. But in fact much of the book deals with the impact such men have made on human history. It is for this reason that I think Morris' book is just so much huey. Sure climate and location have played a role in human history but it has been people who have ultimately changed things. We have only to think of China in modern times to see that this is true. Mao united China after the disruptions of the war with Japan and civil war and Dung created the changes that lead to the \\"opening up\\" that is the basis for China's modern day rise. No Mao and no Dung and things may well have turned out differently.  Having been to Stanford (14 years!) and having sat through lectures by people like Morris I suppose that I am biased. But really, no one can predict the future.  A lot of people seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of the East's rise in the 21st century and it may well happen. But not because of some Cro-magnon man who lived 14,000 years ago.lived 14,000 years ago.

1400067936|2.0|I enjoyed some of the ideas in this book, but there weren't too many of them. I found the book to be redundant and rambling at times.  However, the author does a great job of making the book accessible to many types of readers. I work in finance, but this book isn't really about finance. There is very little finance jargon (or even tough vocab) in here, and what little there is is well defined. There are also no abstract concepts the author doesn't explain well (sometimes too well - get on with it!).  I was most frustrated by the author's tone. He says before the references section at the end that the book was meant to be playful, but it just isn't. The author is condescending and spends half the book reaming journalists and smack-talking other traders. He practically lives in a cave because he is afraid of most technology and other people. He is self-righteous, misanthropic and just a downer in general.   The book really could've been fun, as the author clearly has the chops to write at an accessible level about interesting subject matter. Too bad the author was too busy fleshing out his personal grudges to do that.
0062060554|3.0|This debut novel starts out with a young woman waking up in strange bed next to an older man. She notices that he's wearing a wedding ring and is ashamed at what she's done. She thinks last night must have been a party where she got so drunk she doesn't remember anything at all. She cautiously slinks out of bed, finds the bathroom, locks the door, and then looks in the mirror. That's when things go horribly wrong.    \\"The face I see looking back at me is not my own. The hair has no volume and is cut much shorter than I wear it; the skin on the cheeks and under the chin sags; the lips are thin; the mouth turned down. I cry out, a wordless gasp that would turn into a shriek of shock were I to let it, and then notice the eyes. The skin around them is lined, yes, but despite everything else, I can see that they are mine. The person in the mirror is me, but I am twenty years too old. Twenty-five. More.\\"    Just imagine: you're a 47 year old woman who can't remember most of her entire adult life. Her physician, Dr. Nash, explains that she's had amnesia for a long time. \\"You can't retain new memories, so you've forgotten much of what's happened to you for your entire adult life. Every day you wake up as if you are a young woman. Some days you wake as if you are a child.\\"    Faced with this physical disability, Dr. Nash encourages her to keep a journal. She gradually remembers her name: Christine Lucas. But her inability to recall much else means she must rely heavily on the two men in her life: Dr. Nash and her husband Ben. But are they trustworthy? Are the fleeting memories she has accurate? And what about the eerie entry in her journal, just below her name, in blue ink and capital letters:    DON'T TRUST BEN.    Dennis Lehane, one of my favorite authors, describes this novel as \\"Momento on crystal meth.\\" While it doesn't contain quite the number of twists and turns as that cult favorite movie, it still packs a wallop.

B001E45XT4|5.0|Compared to the Logitech headphones that I had previously (and I'm a fan of Logitch) the Plantronics GameCom 367 has to be the best yet.

I would recommend them to those looking for a good gaming headset that is not over priced.
159420229X|5.0|Alabama - Montgomery.  This is a fascinating book about memory. The unusual title derives from a memory technique used by the author while competing in the US Memory Championship - a strange contest held each year in New York City where people try to remember the names of strangers, random digits, poetry, and a shuffled deck of playing cards.  Alaska - Juneau.  The author went to the event as a journalist and ended up becoming friends with some of the competitors. One thing led to another and before he knew it, he was studying both ancient and modern memory techniques and competing at the next US Memory Championship.  Arizona - Phoenix.  What I enjoyed about this book was that it told a story about memory devices, people with famous memories and the ability to recall unbelievable amounts of data (like the real life Rain Man: Kim Peek). It was interesting to learn about people with unusual abilities and how, with a little effort, everyday people could train their memories to recall many more things than you ever thought possible.  California - Sacramento.  As opposed to the dry memory books that just teach various mnemonic tricks, Moonwalking with Einstein draws you in to an absorbing story with a likable writer as the central character. In the best possible way, Foer makes exercising your memory sound - if not exciting - at least worthwhile.  Colorado - Denver.  It prompted me to try out a couple of the techniques. As a result, I now know all the US states in alphabetical order - along with their capitals.  Connecticut - Hartford.  Next stop: the US Presidents in order, including the years they served.  George Washington - 1789 - 1797.  After that - who knows? The Gettysburg Address?  Four score and seven years ago our fathers....
B004EQAVFU|2.0|The first thing you notice about this bleak story of another time and place is the brown and grey sets and costumes.  Everything from the building to the clothing to the interiors is all drab.  So from the start, you know this isn't going to be any fun.  I find it hard to believe that even children are so subdued that they can't play or even chase a ball past certain artificial boundaries.  I was also waiting patiently for a reason why these now young adults can't just walk away from their fate of organ donation and ultimate death.  Perhaps this is spelled out in the novel from which it originated but to me, it's just a big hole in the plot.  Anyway the acting is fine, especially some of the children that control most of the first half of the film.  Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley were good and Carey Mulligan almost saves the film as Kathy.  In the end however, it's just a somber, bleak version of the world that doesn't make a lot of sense.
0374532990|5.0|This book is a compulsively readable and surprisingly (at times shockingly) honest account from the two guys, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, who took on the High Line project and saw it through over the last 12 years.  It begins with the chance meeting of the project's co-founders in 1999, and is written in their own voices as they give a loosely chronological account of the project up to the opening of the first section of the park in 2009.  Along the way, the book gives a truly \\"insider\\" perspective with plenty of juicy details. What did Edward Norton think of the High Line when he lived in the neighborhood?  Who do you have talk to to get in front of designer Diane von Furstenberg? What does a property owner who traded swords with Arnold Schwarzenegger have to do with the High Line?  How did Friends of the High Line almost lose a staff member over an Aeron chair?  And why did Jean-Claude (of Christo and Jean-Claude, the famous artists) scold Robert over his formatting of a letter?  All these questions (and many, many more) are answered in this \\"who's who\\" of New York activists, officials, architects, powerful figures, and neighborhood characters.  This book is a must-read for anyone who is interested in the High Line, but also anyone who's interested in New York, urban planning, architecture, or the way cities change over time.  Even people who know \\"everything\\" about the High Line will be surprised by some of the revelations! I could also see this being an essential road map for people who have \\"big ideas,\\" as it explains all the steps that Robert Hammond and Josh David took to make the High Line \\"dream\\" into a reality.  There's enough information here to be a school textbook for anyone who wants to be a planner or a social entrepreneur - but, unlike a textbook, it's actually fun to read.  Also - the second half of the book is full of incredible color photographs, including photos of the High Line under construction, historical photos, and beautiful landscapeshots of the converted park.  The visual story presented by the photographs is just as compelling as the text.  I think this would be a good holiday gift for anyone who likes the High Line park, or also anyone on your gift list who already owns these: [[ASIN:0679644334 The Death and Life of Great American Cities (50th Anniversary Edition) (Modern Library)]]  [[ASIN:0394720245 The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York]] [[ASIN:1580932649 Building Up and Tearing Down: Reflections on the Age of Architecture]] [[ASIN:388243726X Joel Sternfeld: Walking The High Line]] [[ASIN:0312148240 Empire State Building: The Making of a Landmark]] [[ASIN:0195383869 AIA Guide to New York City]] [[ASIN:0615211917 Designing the High Line: Gansevoort Street to 30th Street]] [[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]] [[ASIN:0062120999 Great by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck--Why Some Thrive Despite Them All]]

B003ZD9DUC|4.0|Mel Gibson first got noticed in America through the 3 \\"Mad Max\\" films although this original never came to the U.S. until after \\"Mad Max 2\\" or \\"Road Warrior\\" as it was known in the U. S., screened.  While that movie was a clich&eacute;d game changer, the original has its charm as well.  Produced on a non-existent budget, this Australian film is set in a futuristic style of dust, poverty, lawlessness that we have now come to expect.  The bad guys are just road marauders who exist to create havoc.  The good guys are the cops (Mel) who are out to bring peace to the countryside.  The movie is beautifully shot and directed, especially given the money they clearly didn't have.  There's no CGI here.  All the stunts are real stunt men and the driving sequences are first rate.  Sure there's not much of a plot, but all hell breaks loose when Max comes back in the sequel.  Stay tuned.

B0052REUW0|4.0|It is hard for me to offer a critical analysis of this book and its assertions because this is not my field of study -- of course, neither is it Pinker's exclusively, but he does bring a certain insight and understanding, thanks to his background, to the topic (the history of violence) that would probably be lacking in a historian's take on the subject.<br />Pinker does quote historians, and statisticians, and Woody Allen at length, but always coupled with his thoughtful analysis and perspective as an evolutionary psychologist.<br />This is important to note because I think it's a large part why people react against Pinker -- he advocates we are who we are largely because of genetics and the whole history of evolution. We are not endowed from on high nor are we sculpted by our parents.<br />And yet we have grown and matured as a species, and Pinker does a good job tracking our progress with hard data (somewhere in the middle of the book we are overwhelmed with charts and graphs and stats), analysis of cultural artifacts (like the bloody Hebrew Bible), and the discussing the limits and usefulness of the Leviathan and enlightened, progressive values.<br />I appreciated the book very much, and it was worth spending the six weeks it took to read it. I think Pinker is right, we should be grateful for the progresses we have seen. Violence is down, even with all the strife in the world today. Empirically is has declined. Reading this book has made me more thankful for democracy, reason, feminism, and other liberalizing forces that have helped sculpt and mold us into something greater than evolution prepared us for.

And once you've gone through the long drawnout process, you'll find that it won't even play on your iPad. And quite frankly, you probably wouldn't even want to try and figure out how to play it on your iPad (I didn't even try) because you don't actually own the movie, you only get to \\"rent\\" it for a couple of years. And, to top it off, the movie is streaming which means you have to have wi-fi to watch it, so forget about watching it if you're traveling. I give the movie itself 5 stars, but the UltraViolet digital copy gets zero stars.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|This classic Scorsese picture is brought to a whole new layer of cinematic experience in Blu ray, Robert deniro is in his best career . Best Bluray film i bought this year
B005BGBPBG|5.0|Great chick flick! I thought this movie was going to be dripping with corniness and predictability, but it did leave something to the imagination. Albeit frustrating at points the ridiculousness of the characters, it provided a nice escape from the monotony of daily life. I especially liked Ginnifer Goodwin in this role, she is definitely making her mark on the silver screen. Highly recommend this pic if you are in the mood for a good chick flick...either by yourself or a group of gal pals.

0756404738|3.0|I loved NOTW and re-read it right before reading this one.  I could hardly put it down and it had me sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time.  In comparison, the Wise Man's Fear seemed to be a long, winding path to nowhere.  It seemed as though too much time was spent on certain things (Felurian, training in Ademre, etc.) and other points of the story were over in 2 pages. Granted, I'm not Patrick Rothfuss so I don't know where he will be taking things in book 3 but it seems as though there will be a lot of loose ends that need trimming!  I will still pre-order the 3rd book and scarf it down because I'm anxious to see how things end, but I sure hope the flow of it resembles NOTW more than the 2nd book.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|I just received the cover I purchased the same day I purchased my Fire.  I have not yet received the Fire, so I don't know yet if I will be keeping this cover, or sending it back.    The main reason I bought this particular cover was for the stand, and without the Fire I have no way of knowing if it will actually do the job, but without the Fire, it slips right down.    I am also surprised there is no function or mechanism for holding the Fire in place, such as they have with the other Kindles.  If it does the job, I will keep it as a back up, but it is a real disappointment, as I expected better for the price.
B0041KKYGU|1.0|To all Movie Producers and Screenwriters:  If you're going to present one or more unlikable central characters in a movie, TRY to make them INTERESTING in some manner, alright? Goodfellas' Henry Hill is a more winning character than the skank Cameron Diaz portrays here! At least make her a likable rogue like Sgt. Bilko or self-absorbed but spunky and oblivious like Jenna from 30 Rock!<br /><br />Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, who is such a manipulative, superficial, crass, insensitive, thieving, bong-sucking, gold-digging sociopath that Lindsay Lohan would be embarrassed to be seen with her.  The principal and her fellow teachers are a motley collection of stereotypical nerds, dweebs, and Dudley Dorights right out of central casting. So, compared to this panorama of Mayberry expatriates, and recognizing the social Darwinism of the audience, we're supposed to \\"root for\\" Halsey because she's...well, because she's played by Cameron Diaz!  In school she calls an overweight boy \\"Chubs\\" before she lands a basketball (could've been a volleyball, though) in his face for getting a question wrong. Later on, Halsey gets invited to a student's family's home for Christmas dinner, after which (like a true sociopath \\"responding\\" to someone's kindness) she steals a glass figurine from their fireplace's mantle. Our heroine!<br /><br />This might be defensible--the characters in The Usual Suspects were a lot worse (weren't they?)--provided this movie was at all FUNNY. If you're a mean-spirited middle-schooler that's discovered the dubious glories of foul language and want to see a once-hot-looking-but-it's-fading actress play a shallow creep, you'll have the time of your life.<br /><br />But we can't have a \\"bad\\" character be the star of the story, can we? Especially if she's a teacher, right? We have to see some change of heart, and...she shows concern for her students!  But that's not only far-fetched (after the personality we've seen), but utterly PHONY. It'd be more plausible for Vincent Price as Dr. Phibes saying at the end of one of his kill-the-British-actors-one-by-one movies, \\"Maybe gruesomely murdering people I don't like isn't the way to go--perhaps I'll volunteer my services at a hospital burn unit.\\"es saying at the end of one of his kill-the-British-actors-one-by-one movies, \\"Maybe gruesomely murdering people I don't like isn't the way to go--perhaps I'll volunteer my services at a hospital burn unit.\\"
B00005QW5X|5.0|It's pretty difficult to explain. Not that the movie is incredibly deep and full of allusions. It's because our main protagonist is unlike any before, with a slight nod towards Rocky Horror.<br /><br />Meet Hedwig. After a botched surgery that was intended to be a ticket out of Berlin, he finds himself on a razor's edge of insanity and angst. Lots of angst. And he wrote a song for each of those times. Looking into the Abyss and something is seen. But even then, he can't crawl out from the infinite mouth-like cave. Anyway, he meets a guy and there is chemistry. They grow into an awkward relationship. This is seen as a break-up when his main squeeze Tommy Spect up and steals all of Hedwing's music and adopted a moniker Tommy Gnosis. Tommy gets all the fame while Hedwig mostly gets on stage in sleazy bar and underwhelming concerts with a single fan in attendance. The whole movie hinges on Hedwig and Tommy, and once the film reaches the climax I was left with a breath of fresh air; too few movies create something as solid and insightful.<br /><br />Extra Features - commentaries, deleted scenes... all the normal fare. The Whether You Like it or Not documentary is a really good feature that shows the evolution of the Hedwig phenomena.<br /><br />Soundtrack - who cares? The only thing you should expect from the sound track is the songs. This is a musical, and after every emotional beat, someone (usually Hedwig) would burst into song... not just songs, these are movements of truth trying to escape from the B.S. and banality of the world. But it does have a 5.1 and DTS.<br /><br />Hedwig get's into your head and it's a lot to take in, being hilarious at one time and three seconds later a solid fog of emotional doom looms over the cast.<br /><br />It's a flip of the coin. You'll either love it, or you're gonna hate it.  The film itself is a lot of fun. The music is surreal. Watch it. Then send me a message, let me know what your feelings are for the 'Origin of Love'. By the time that song is done, you'll know whether or not you'll enjoy the rest of the film.ime that song is done, you'll know whether or not you'll enjoy the rest of the film.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I love this movie. It show how strong Superman is better than other superheroes. I think Brandon Routh do the best, people judge too much about him. He is the best man for Superman Movie after Christofer Reeves, it's true. His personalities between Superman and Clark Kent are great, look very different. Dean Cain is charming but I soon realize that Clark Kent is Superman. Oh, I can't wait to see the next story if they want to make it. Superman's son ? And Clark will get hurry to make Lois understand him and marry him ? Oh, it'll great. I come from South East, sorry if my English is bad. But I really like Superman because he is one man with one true love, not like other superheroes.

0930289234|1.0|I got the Kindle Fire edition (which isn't allowing reviews, as it doesn't think the book has been released yet). The panels are too small to read on the Fire (would be fine on the iPad or even most netbooks or PC's, but you can't download the book there, or to a generic Android tablet). Worst of all, the individual panels repeat a random number of times, anywhere from 3-9 in a row (this may be tied to the number of individual content boxes on a page, but only loosely).<br /><br />Avoid this as an ebook until there is a larger device it can be read and the repeat issue is corrected (if it showed one box/page, that might solve both).
B00111YM5G|3.0|This is one of those movies that is just full of amazing ideas but it never feels more than a B movie. Granted, this film was released direct to video, but it was such a great idea that I feel it should have truly deserved a big production budget. For what it was, it was pretty good.  For what it could have been, it was okay.  I love Andy Whitfield and my heart goes out to his and family and friends who will truly miss him in a way the fans never will. Rest in Peace Brother.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|I already see the complaints coming.  Why a career spanning greatest hits on the heals of 2 greatest hits sets that already do that much?  Well, this set really isn't meant so much for those that are already R.E.M. fans... Heck, you probably own all the albums already anyway and could assemble your perfect playlist onto your MP3 player or a CD if you wanted to.<br /><br />This is the type of set that should appeal to the novice listener.  Maybe you discovered R.E.M. thanks to Collapse Into Now, and you don't know where to go from there.  Well, this is a good place to go.  Granted you could buy both of the previous greatest hits collections, and those are especially worthwhile if you are going to look for the early stuff or latter stuff.  But as many will point out, R.E.M. were not so much a hits band as a great band altogether.  I'd say the novice fan would be better to concentrate his efforts on this collection and then move onto an album that encapsulates what you like most from this collection.  This may be the type of set that directs you to start at Murmur or maybe you go to Automatic for the People next.  This collection is one reasonably priced package that will be really good for the new fans.<br /><br />For current fans.  The new tracks may be better obtained by buying the mp3's.  If you are more of a lossless or CD listener, I still don't think the price of the collection is horrible, even if you are only getting 3 songs (at least from Amazon).  Last, given the upcoming holiday season, this may be the chance to turn someone onto this band and let them discover the joy R.E.M. has given you over the years.

B005NPLXJ4|1.0|Lulu has to be the most massive failure from Metallica to date.  Yes, I know, it is a collaboration with Lou Reed, and Metallica is simply filling the role as Reed's studio artists for this recording.  It is awful.  Do not buy it.  Do not even listen to any samples.  Instead, dust off your old Kill 'em All and Master of Puppets and listen to music that does not suck.  So many of us have been hoping for so long that Metallica would listen to their fans and return to the music that we love.  This endeavor has convinced me that the band truly does not care what the fans want and are looking for a way to retire as the most hated act ever.  Seriously folks, it is that bad.  No epic solos.  Just a constant grind in the background to Reeds warped musings.  Had Johnny Cash lived longer, that would have been an epic collaborative effort.  But then again, Cash's lyrics would not have sucked.  Lulu is heading straight for the bargain bin folks, and that is where it should remain.  Even at a deep discount, it will not be worth your money. Save your money for an extra pack of toilet paper.  You will get better use from it.

B004ZNB12O|4.0|Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 4 stars; Economic Value: 4 stars; Relevance: 2 stars<br /><br />Pinlk Floyd has been compiled twice before: the rather curious 1981 (vinyl-era) \\"A Collection of Great Dance Songs\\" (an ironic album title as there ever has been!) and the 2001 2CD \\"Echoes\\", which seemed to be the definitive Floyd compilation. Now, 10 years later, on the heels of the reissuance of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" in many different formats, and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to be reissued shortly, comes this newest \\"best of\\".<br /><br />\\"A Foot In the Door: The Best of Pink Floyd\\" (16 tracks; 79 min.) basically distills \\"Echoes\\" into a single CD collection. First things first, the music on here is fantastic, let there be no doubt about it. But there are a number of setbacks or even flaws with this compilation. For whatever reason, this is not a chronological review of the band, starting off inexplicably with \\"Hey You\\" from \\"The Wall\\", which then dives straight into \\"See Emily Play\\" from the Syd Barret era, whoa?? Second, it contains \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\", from \\"The Final Cut\\" album, which nobody cares about and instead could've been used to bring \\"Run Like Hell\\" or \\"Young Lust\\" from \\"The Wall\\", both of which are missing. That aside, it brings the usual \\"suspects\\" of the Floyd catalog (5 tracks from \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", 3 from \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and 4 from \\"The Wall).<br /><br />I really wonder to whom this compilation is pitched to. I suppose the \\"casual\\" Pink Floyd fan, if there is such a person? And even if there is one, most of these songs are played to death on classic radio, so why buy this? I have most of Pink Floyd's albums so I would never buy this, but to the casual Pink Floyd fan out there: I would recommend \\"Echoes\\" over this compilation, as it contains several must-have tracks such as \\"Astronomy Domine\\", \\"Echoes\\", and \\"One of These Days\\" that are missing here, just to name those. That aside, \\"A Foot In the Door\\" is a very fan-friendly priced compilation that gives you 80 min. of basic Pink Floyd.80 min. of basic Pink Floyd.

B004WE01YA|4.0|I was dreading watching this movie in 3D as I had ordered this along with the Lion King, and was very disappointed in the 3D quality of the Lion King.  However, I was pleasantly surprised that the 3D quality of Beauty and the Beast was much better than the Lion King.  Yes, there was a bit of ghosting and some of the 2D layering effect, but overall it was fairly well done, considering it was a 3D \\"retrofit\\" and not done in 3D originally. If your budget only allows for 1 Disney 3D movie and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one, or the Lion King, I'd recommend this one (at least on the basis of the 3D--you would have to decide which story you like better.)  What really throws me is that both movies were released at the same time in 3D, and the 3D quality is so different.
B0061XCZ4E|4.0|The main point of this review is just to say how glad I am that I did not have to buy this entire collection in order to get the three new songs. All three were available for download from Amazon, so I did not have to pay to re-purchase 37 other songs that I already own on the original albums as well as other collections, like the outstanding \\"Eponymous\\" as well as \\"And I Feel Fine ... the IRS Years\\" and \\"In Time.\\"<br /><br />None of the three new songs reach the level of R.E.M.'s classics, but \\"We All Go Back to Where We Belong\\" comes closest, a lovely melody and lyrics that would have fit well on Collapse Into Now. \\"Hallelujah\\" is one last chance for Stipe and Mills to harmonize together, one of the best pairings of voices in rock history. These songs are definitely worth having as an epilogue to R.E.M.'s brilliant career.<br /><br />There are too many great songs in R.E.M.'s catalog for any collection to truly do them justice. On the other hand, even a subpar R.E.M. collection will be quite good. The problem is that they have too many songs worthy of inclusion, rather than having too few. Ultimately, I think the only real value of this set is the new songs. For a better intro to the band, I'd recommend checking out albums representative of the band's different eras: You can't go wrong with (chronologically listed) Murmur, Document, Out of Time, or Automatic for the People. They have other classic albums, but those are the four that stand out to me as the best of the best.
B00000K3D4|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  \\"Labyrinth,\\" director Jim Henson's 1986 fantasy, turns on the performance of rocker David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King.  The story takes wisps from Lewis Carroll and reimagines 'Alice' as if she had a little brother to rescue from Wonderland as well as restoring herself.  Jennifer Connelly is marvelous and natural in her film debut as Sarah, the girl who must somehow outwit the Goblin King, playing his game on his terms to rescue her baby brother.  There is a simmering chemistry between Ms. Connelly and Mr. Bowie, though Henson always keeps the movie's tone fairly suitable for family viewing.  David Bowie is completely believable in a role he was born to play, also contributing several songs to the movie.  My personal favorites are \\"Magic Dance\\" and \\"It's Only Forever.\\"  The casting for Jareth is crucial, and Bowie completely inhabits the role.  A wispy menace and a smirking, subtle predator for both Sarah and her brother Toby, Jareth is a very good villain.  Jim Henson populates the movie with original Muppet creations, and the best of them are a disagreeable gnomelike creature called Hoggle and an eerie Junk Lady.  If it's possible to overdo Muppets, this movie may have done it.  I would have rather seen much more of the fascinating dynamic between Sarah and Jareth and less of the plentiful new Muppets. The movie is still very good.
B005TQACLC|2.0|I'm one of the rare people that is giving this a low score not because of bitter dislike for Britney, because I'm quite the opposite and have every disc and have seen many of her shows.  This rating is specifically for the production value of the DVD/Blu-Ray release of the Femme Fatale concert.  If you saw this concert in person, then you'd know that she actually sang a hefty portion of the show live, which is what fans have been asking for (especially after she lip synced the entire Circus concert).  However, on this DVD/Blu-Ray, when she does sing live, you can only faintly hear the actual vocals underneath pre-recorded tracks that were NOT heard at the actual concert (even the YouTube clips will prove this).  Why the producers of the disc would choose to cover her live vocals and continue to feed the \\"Britney lip syncs because she can't sing\\" myth is beyond me.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|To be honest, I have mixed feelings about this book.<br /><br />On one hand, it was very, very nice to read a novel that flowed -- stylistically, grammatically, and so forth. (What can I say: the rise of self-publishing has sometimes made reading a chore these days.) And King did a fairly good job of describing life and people as they were back in the early '60s, with their beauty as well as their ugliness. In this way, the book was really solid.<br /><br />[SPOILER] On the other hand, I was really thrown by the main character, Jake's, blind insistence that the world would have been a better place if JFK had lived. Really? Why? He didn't substantively question that premise. I just don't get it. He simply went ahead full-throttle in his attempt to change history. I guess it's safe to say that I never really understood Jake's motivation for trying to stop the assassination. For me, this yawning gap of reason/logic really marred the novel.<br /><br />Sigh.<br /><br />If you want to read some excellent time travel novels, I'd stick with Jack Finney and Josephine Tey; you can't go wrong there.

B001UV4XJ2|1.0|This is not a review of the movie. If you saw the previous 7, then you will see 7.2 regardless of the reviews (but needless to say this was the best of all of the prior movies and finished off the series very well.) The problem is the Digital Copy. As all of the prior reviews state, Ultra Violet is streaming only. No internet connection, no wifi access, no unlimited data plan, and then this product doesn't work. You MUST be online to use.  I am writing this review because I thought there would be a work-around due to being able to download the movie onto my computer. Once I set up a Flixster account, Ultra Violet account, downloaded Adobe Air, downloaded the Flixster launcher/media player and agreed to about 5 different legal statements then I was able to download the movie to my computers hard drive and then I tried to move Harry Potter into iTunes. You can download the 2 GB file, but you CAN NOT TRANSFER/CUT/COPY TO ITUNES as the file is MPEG4.   Therefore, the only way to watch is streaming or on your physical computer. No Apple support provided.....period.   NOTE to media executives: iTunes, iPod, iPhone, iPad and even Apple TV are the most popular media devices on the planet and have put numerous \\"like\\" products such as Zune, Android/WebOS Tablets, Google TV, etc into their graves! Not allowing an Apple medium access to a purchased digital copy is beyond ignorant. This product will fail.  I will be deleting my UV account, Flixster launcher, downloaded file on my computer, and NEVER purchasing a movie that contains and Ultra Violet Digital Copy. Please do yourself a favor and buy the movie only addition!

006621131X|2.0|\\"Just Kids\\" is a snapshot of a time and place that is gone forever, and for that reason it piqued my interest at first. I admire Smith's guts and determination as a young woman homeless and adrift in New York, trying to discover who she was. Her accounts of the Chelsea Hotel, CBGB, etc., in the '60s and '70s allowed me a glimpse into that world. The name dropping got tiresome, although (to be fair) sightings of rocks stars and famous poets were common in New York then.<br /><br />But then there are countless references to Rimbaud, Genet, Baudelaire, and others ad nauseam -- and Smith never explains why these artists are so important to her. She is incapable of describing her friends and even the most prosaic situations without invoking a famous dead Frenchman. And she repeatedly and groundlessly includes herself and Mapplethorpe in the same company with the greatest artists of the 19th and 20th centuries. Although she ties herself into knots striving for the poetic line, the prose is pedestrian and somewhat juvenile (\\"we did this,\\" \\"we went there,\\" \\"I wore that,\\" \\"the work was good\\" [tell us why!]). But because she's trying so hard (\\"masked ball of confusion\\"), the writing calls attention to itself and pushes the reader out of the narrative.<br /><br />She shines a steady, saintly light on Mapplethorpe, despite his failings and sometimes ill treatment of her. The book feels superficial -- she tells us what everyone wore -- and needs more grit and immediacy, showing us who these people really were, and why. This is a shame, because clearly she wrote it with feeling and still grieves for her lost friend. Smith could have used more editorial guidance -- and should have left Rimbaud dead and buried after the first few adoring references.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|The debut season of this series is, plot-wise, certainly good enough to keep viewers wanting more.  And the actors are competent, though too often they are victims of an overwrought, parody-prone direction that skews the stolidness of their performanances.  For, truly, this cinematic offering is farcical and was meant to be.    The premiere episodes of Mad Men deal with the legacy of the Fifties, and the show's creators have pulled out all the stops in mocking and denigrating the decade.  That alone will make for low satire, but the entire effort is enervated by an obvious lack of knowledge and understanding of the era.  Even in the basest forms of farce, the achievement of the sardonic depends on reality as its foundation, and the failure to employ subtlety in the treatment can doom its effectiveness.  For instance, this series presents smoking as ubiquitous and feverish in a manner that it never was.  At a time in which the activity was accepted almost everywhere, people did it leisurely.  There was no need to puff like a freight train for a nicotine high in a non-forbidden zone.  Many people used matches instead of lighters, and they didn't light up indoors with one hand shielding against a non-existent wind.  This kind of exaggeration results not in satire, but in burlesque.    As for pacing, the first couple of episodes are hobbled by a seemingly desperate impulse to inject as much anti-Fifties propaganda as an audience could be expected to stomach.  White males are overtly chauvinistic, white females overtly compliant, and blacks of both sexes menial-working, overtly servile, covertly surly, resentful, unhappy people.  After these wearisome premises have been well, well established, then the series gets more deeply into plotting.    The show's lead, Dan Draper, is not the manipulative, mercenary, unscrupulous, cut-throat character one might expect from the title.  Despite a sexist viewpoint, he treats women well.  He doesn't demean or prey on co-workers, and his on-the-side sex is with self-competent women.  He is affectionate and passionate with his wife.    Yet the creators' compulsion to spoof the Fifties/Sixties demands that they present Mrs. Draper as a neurotic, self-centered suburban housewife who worries about pretty divorcees and would rather see her daughter dead that facially scarred.  She lets her children put plastic dry-cleaning covers over their heads and romp unbelted in her vehicle.  As she putters about in her pumps and crinolined dresses, she presents an over-the-top image of a demented Fifties homemaker who, she earnestly tells Draper, thinks of nothing else but having sex with him.  Indeed, she does have a handsome, attentive, hardworking husband who many women would covet, yet she fantacizes about coupling with a milktoasty salesman/stranger and--somehow--orgasms against a running washing machine.  But, then again, the series' only all-together women are promiscuous.  Even single career women with one lover are portrayed as naive, frustrated, or unhealthily guilt-ridden.  Pre-sexual-revolution females, the series all but shouts, were mostly miserable creatures who often died in childbirth or succumbed young to dreadful diseases.  Christianity crippled them emotionally and intellectually and, in at least one case, created a wicked stepmother.  By the time 1960 rolled around, they were dizzily wearing mismatched clothing, draping living room furniture, and voting for Richard Nixon.    The problem with the program as lampoon is that it also strives to be a serious, ongoing serial that maintains interest and sympathy in Dan Draper.  It doesn't aid the drama to stick him in the same style of Production-Code pajamas that are also donned by his squirrely co-worker/rival or to subject the character and audience alike to  boring, protracted scenes like a beatnik debauch wherein everyone simply gets stoned.    The best aspect of the series is the business intrigue that has little or nothing to do with the show's sex, which is often as hurried and unpassionate as a toilet-stall encounter between strangers.  Scenes that do denote true affection are, of course, subject to the usual modern-day dread of deep kissing between actors and thus come off as chaste and staid.  The cause of the latter matter is something that really did begin in the Sixties.

0684867621|5.0|I felt this was a great story. A child lost in the woods, trying to make do with whatever survival instinct she can muster. With what seems like every decision taking her farther away from where she wants to be. Whether it is God or Tom Gordon, she knows there is something watching over her. All the fears and dangers of the wilderness and problems that can kill someone lost in the woods can be settled by the soothing sound of a radio broadcast about familiar Red Sox Pitcher closing up the last innings. But then it is back to reality, how to survive, how to make it out of the wilderness.<br /><br />Definitely worth the short read.
B005RK6EUS|5.0|HUGE SPOILER ALERT IF YOU HAVE NO WATCH IT YET!  Basically this is just amazing! The series end where it begins. WOW IM JUST MIND BLOWN! I have nothing to say seriously all I can say is that this is just stunning!
1846142733|1.0|Can this not be viewed as anything but transparent bloviation? \\" I need a paycheck\\" let me conjure up some half baked half controversial claptrap and satisfy my editor...\\" It is all in the sam vein as \\"The World is Flat\\", Empire etc etc. All of this genre is irrelevant or out of context, past its \\"Sell By\\" date before it goes to press. Its conjecture and postulation AT BEST !<br />So, the West is in decline, is this NEWS ?<br />Unbelievable what people will write and even MORE unbelievable is that its read, and paid for !<br />Please, dont buy this.
1400079144|2.0|I remember loving The Da Vinci Code and even more Angels and Demons. But now I think I might need to revisit them to determine if I really liked them or not. The first thirty chapters of The Lost Symbol had me cringing and whining. It felt like one big lecture on symbolism. Like I hadn't jumped into an adventure with Robert Langdon I had just jumped into his classroom. Then, as they went through the mystery, it felt like when I was a child and played make-believe. You know when you play that there's a mystery and you just found the biggest clue of all, it's a dust bunny under the couch, and it has so much meaning and is the answer to the puzzle. It just felt too coincidental that these things kept happening. (Which is why I want to revisit the other two books.) Every novel is its own planet and has its own rules. Even if it is set in our normal world, there are differences. This book fell outside its own rules a few times and that irks me because it tosses me right out of the story.<br /><br />On the positive side, the villain is amazing. His final act of 'telling the world' is a very convincing threat. But did I have to go through so much muck to get to that great ending? There is a multitude of crazy but logical revelations at the end that make it all come together. I mean, he is a thriller writer after all and they have to explain the insane story at some point.<br /><br />This novel seems to be a classic case of tell versus show for me. Robert Langdon spends way too much time explaining the symbols and not enough time being chased. I didn't like it. The end was not worth the beginning.
1423136802|5.0|My son is addicted to these books, its nice they have the box set for a good price because its expensive one book at a time.
0061148512|4.0|I put off reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath first because everyone in college had read it and it just seemed cliche. Then I put it off because I was worried it would scare me with all the craziness inside. It's not scary, but perhaps in the mundane and normal way she is insane it is more scary than if she was a true nut. Because that means I could be just like her.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful, simply beautiful. Such normality made into such vivid imagery. The change in Esther is so gradual and yet so prominent. It begins with moments of silence and then strange sounds. It becomes utter calm almost to the point of lethargy. Then she just gives in to the fact that the world is monotonous and she doesn't want to deal with that.<br /><br />Some of my favorite lines from the book:<br /><br />\\"Every so often a beam of light appeared out of thin air, traversed the wall like a ghostly, exploratory finger, and slid off into nothing again.\\"<br /><br />\\"It dazzled and danced with light like a heavenly ice cube.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wrapping my black coat round me like my own sweet shadow, I unscrewed the bottle of pills and started taking them swiftly, between gulps of water, one by one by one.\\"

B0020BUWX2|4.0|If I Stay by Gayle Forman is a young adult novel about a seventeen-year-old girl, Mia, who is having an out-of-body experience. She is in a car crash with her family and ends up in a coma but is observing everything as if she is a ghost alongside her body. The book follows her through the trauma of listening to her bereaved friends and family, and jumping back into memories. There are spoilers, so stop here if you don't want to find out.<br /><br />I finished this book in about 3 hours. It simply sucked me in and held me there. I couldn't stop. It's a roller coaster from complete nervous breakdown when she sees her family smeared across the road; to hearing her Grandpa say it's ok if she doesn't fight anymore, she can let go; to laughing with her when she remembers how hopped up on marshmallows her little brother was the night they had a big labor day picnic.<br /><br />The characters are vivid. They are people that I can't stand not knowing. I want to immerse myself in their lives and just swim around for hours.<br /><br />Mia's boyfriend, Adam, says at one point, \\"I'll let you go. If you stay.\\" It seems like a seriously overused idea, but it really gave me the chills. I was so invested in the story that I didn't care if it was something I might have seen before.<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br />What a way to end a book. It was like death in reverse. They always say life flashes before your eyes before you die, but hers flashes before she wakes from her coma. She's a very dedicated cellist and it's the sound of a cello (Adam brought her a song to listen to) that immediately changes her mind about dying and wakes her up. I don't think a book has ever truly made me cry before.

0439023483|5.0|My older kids BEGGED me to read this book last year after they had finished it.  I'm late - I was late getting into Harry Potter also.  I finally committed to reading book #1, The Hunger Games, and could not put it down once I picked it up. I think the plot has been sufficiently covered.  I will say that this is one book that has made me fear reading is spoiled for me until I find another book as good, which I'm not sure is going to happen any time soon.  It's that good.  I recommend the second and final book in this series very highly as well, and am looking forward to the movie.
1451627289|3.0|With my birthday coming up on 11-22, my wife presented me with an early present. It was a copy of Stephen King's latest novel, \\"11-22-63.\\" Although I have not read any of King's other work, (I am not into horror, sci-fi, etc. these days) I have noticed some of the good reviews it has received. Because the story focus is President Kennedy's assassination and the fact that I was a political activist college student and supporter of his I thought it would make an interesting read. Moreover, a lot of us have played the \\"what if Kennedy had lived\\" game over the years. In the book, King takes the reader on a trip back in time with a character intent on preventing the assassination. Great idea. I had to find out what happened.  Immediately I was struck by the thickness of the book, which turns out to be nearly 850 pages. I looked forward to the adventure that was going to unfold. What did I find? A good story buried under a bunch of trivia about the 60s era and side trips that made it a labor to read. There were a couple of times that it seemed so bogged down in what must have been a nostalgia trip for King that I asked myself if I really wanted to continue on. I plodded through and in the end, found it to be an interesting take on the events surrounding the assassination, and time travel for the purpose of changing history. It did leave me thinking.  In my opinion, it does not live up to the hype. It is certainly not a \\"must read.\\"
B005POK858|2.0|Installed the app even after reading the difficulties of other DROIDX users and experienced the same maladies.  Game looks fun but not at the sake of forced restarts of phone, music stopping after 3 minutes of gaming, and the inevitably forced stop.  Hope the developers remedy this soon.
B005POK858|5.0|This app installed directly to my SD card all by itself. That's the first time I've ever had that happen.<br />Haven't played yet-wanted to address the app2SD issue first. Will re-rate after playing, which could be some time.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|My kid is addicted to this game. Performs well on my Transformer, but graphics are a tad blurry on the 10&quot; display. Occasional lags, but still playable. No problems yet saving games. Should be at least a dollar less than current price until display is polished for tablets.
B005POK858|4.0|Just like the RPG's I used to play. Game play, story, graphics, are very good. This is games better than the ones similar that cost so it's definitely worth playing.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Great Fantasy hero movie.  Keeps your attention to the movie.  The main actor was good, and so was the leading lady as I call her. Great story line. Can't wait for #2 movie to come out.
B005HT400A|5.0|Great blu ray of one of David Lynch's best films. Extras are the same from the MGM DVD, except for the addition of 50 mins of newly discovered lost footage, which is actually in the bonus features section and not in the film. I didn't notice that at first.<br /><br />Worth it to pick up for the better picture quality and the additional footage which is being seen for the first time on Blu Ray! I myself bought this on a whim, already owning the DVD. The differences in the picture/audio are minor, with slight improvement to both.<br /><br />I had my fingers crossed for an audio commentary of some kind, but alas no luck.<br /><br />RIP Dennis Hopper.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This a great movie for a meet and fall in love story.  Plus the fact that Russell Crowe went back to where he went when he was young boy.  Good memories story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have to first start off by saying that I was excited to read this book for two reasons: I am  huge Stephen King fan and I have a almost ridiculous fascination with President Kennedy, so this book seemed like it was written just for me. I was not disappointed. I'll skip the summary of what the book is about, as I'm sure you have already read the other reviews and don't need yet ANOTHER description. Instead I'll just cut to the chase. When you hear people say that King is a master storyteller, they aint just whistlin' dixie. Every time you think you are going to take a break and put the book down, you find yourself picking it back up just a few minutes later. I get annoyed when I hear him described as a horror writer because ole' Steve is so much more than that. Often times I find the horror element of his books is usually the least interesting. His real strength is in making his characters come to life, and since you find yourself caring about the characters, you become deeply invested in what happens to them.    Some have complained that his books can be too long, but when you get to the end of them, you don't feel like you just read a book, you feel like you just had a life experience. It's that talent that has kept me coming back to King's work again and again, no matter what genre he is diving into. 11/22/63 holds the same magic as previous King epics. Yes, it is long, but King is able to pace the novel in a way so it doesn't FEEL long. In fact, I was able to finish the book in a weeks time, and when I was done, I didn't want it to be over. I found myself growing attached to the characters just as I had when I read THE STAND or UNDER THE DOME, and 11/22/63 packs a similar emotional punch as King's previous work.   For those who say that King lets his left wing politics bleed into his work, I got news for you: HE'S A WRITER! THAT'S WHAT WRITER'S DO! Having a point of view is what seperates the great writers from the average storytellers. Think I'm wrong? Try reading Dickens or Doystoevsky.  My Top 5 Favorite Books from Amazon, in no particular order:  1. 11/22/63 By Stephen King  2.ARNIE'S LAST KILL By Aleister Page  3.A KILLING TIDE By P.J. Alderman  4.A DOZEN DEADLY ROSES By Kathy Bennet  5.ABDUCTED By T.R. Ragan
B005LJITS0|4.0|It was fun - true to the comics I remembered from my youth - I know some prefer the more animated versions - but I much prefer action with real (or mostly real) people rather than watching cartoons.  I enjoyed it a lot, basic storyline great imagination.   HOWEVER - Amazon's method of delivery sucked. Their response to questions or assistance sucked (actually was non-existant). The fact that when ordered I really thougth I BOUGHT it and instead I rented it - and it just didn't work for as long as I 'rented' it for. Month later - still waiting for some kind of response. Meanwhile went at BOUGHT several other movies from conventional places.  Amazon - you need to do better at responding to questions.
B005HS4CUY|4.0|I've had 2 sets of these DVD's.  The first set I started watching Toy Story 3 and it got about 10 minutes in and then froze and went back a track and looped like this continuously.  Sent it back for a replacement.  This time I started with Toy Story 1 and I am having the same problem.  I don't have issues with any other DVD's so I know it isn't my brand new Blu Ray player.  I don't know why the quality of these are so poor.<br /><br />*** UPDATE ***<br /><br />I have changed the rating since I learned that it was my Brand New Samsung 3D Blu Ray player that was the problem... even with updated firmware it didn't work.  So I can't blame the DVD's

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Actually a few beats, many times. I can't begin to explain how amazing this book is. This is my first review, because I've never been so in love with a book before. In the past 36 hours, I've read the book twice and I'm ready to start my third time. I could not put it down. Abby and Travis are truly a beautiful disaster. I can't say enough good things about this book and about this author. The writing reaches into your soul and tugs at your heart strings. I rooted for these two from the second they locked eyes at the fight. I'm truly in love with this pair. There's a review on here that says, \\"Buy it. Devour it. Love it.\\" To me this is the be all and end all of the book. I did all three and was so happy I did. I'm just hoping we haven't heard the last of the Maddox brothers! Ok, I'm done gushing! Just go read it now! You won't be disappointed!

0385535139|4.0|I haven't been a fan of Grisham's recent works. It seems like his last 3 books have been more about pushing an agenda than about writing good fiction. I agree with some of the points he was making, but the books were just tedious to read. The characters were very wooden, with the good guys being all good & the bad guys being all bad. You could figure out how every scene was going to unfold because the characters were so formulaic.   This book is nothing like that. All of the characters have shades of good and bad in them and at most of the major turns in the story, you can envision it going either way. The story was interesting from beginning to end and reminded me of Grisham's earlier works. Definitely worth reading for any Grisham fans.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when i first started watching this show.  The funny thing is, i didn't even know it existed even after i had watched serenity.  I heard about it a little while after i had watched serenity, and always wanted to see it.  Finally about 6 years after watching serenity, i finally find firefly on netflix.    Boy, i was in for a treat, this series became one of my favorites instantly.  The characters were well written and the actors played their parts perfectly.  None of the characters are left out, and you get to know them all on an individual level.  Learning about their relationship with each other and their personalities.    My favorite characters were River and Kaylee.  Kaylee was entertaining with her crush on the doctor, and how he was so clueless to her advances.  She had a very bubbly personality though and was always upbeat and positive.  She was also a very hard worker and kept the ship going.    River was also a entertaining character in her own way.  She always had the strangest comments and was a little off, but in a good way.  Her behavior intrigued me and kept me questioning what she was going to do next.  All the other characters had their own unique personalities as well and were great in their own ways as well, those 2 were just my favorites.  Nathan Fillion is probably my favorite acting wise, i think he is a great actor, however his character just was not my favorite, but don't take that the wrong way, i don't mean it like i didn't like his character i just meant since the other 2 were my favorites that was why his was not.  I loved all the characters in the show, and my only complaint is, that it was canceled way to soon.  I wish the show would have been on for a lot longer.  With less then one full season, it leaves a lot left out, even with the movie summing everything up.    Now i guess i should tell you what the show is about and not just about the characters i liked.  These show is basically about space scavengers, in a way.  Nathan Fillion's character is captain of the firefly and they travel through space looting abandoned or destroyed ships that they find out in space.  They also take jobs from random people throughout the galaxy.  Most of the jobs are not always on the up and up, but they always pay well.  In a way they could be also called space pirates.  But they are good ones so that is all that matters, right.    Nathan plays an ex military veteran who opposed the alliance, so now that the alliance has won the war, he must perform his missions under the radar of the alliance.  Since most of his mission are not always legal, they have to travel fairly low key.  Then there was also the Reavers, who were deranged psychotic humans that committed all sorts of inhuman acts.    If you are a fan of Sci-Fi movies and tv shows, then you will most likely love this show.  I know i sure did.

B003UESJF6|5.0|This is the best kids movie EVER! And I should know because I have watched ten thousand of them with my 4 year old. But this one is great over and over again. I am actually quoting the movie from time to time. Will Ferrel is super genius. This one is best to own not rent because you will watch it over and over.
1451627289|4.0|Yes, the \\"old\\" Stephen King has returned and with that comes the good with the bad. Or maybe I'll say the not quite so good instead of bad.   This is not a horror story, but instead is speculative. If you don't know by now, it is a story about time travel and an attempt to change history. As you would expect, that does not work out so well.  First, the good. Like The Stand, the characters immmediately capture the attention. As with most of King's work, these are down to earth folks with no pretentiousness about them. The main character, Jake, is a school teacher who is soon embroiled in something weird: time travel. It occurs through a portal at a local eatery. Of course, with his skill King makes us believe that it is normal for a portal to exist at a corner restaurant and that Jake will accept that with little doubt.   The reader is also quite willing to go along with Jake for the ride into the past.  Unlike some other recent works, the ending is worthy of the book.  You would have to classify this as a happy ending.  But like the old Stephen, the author does get wordy. I guess the first time trip was supposed to set up the rest of the book, but I think the novel would have been just as good without it and at least 100 pages shorter.  King has always been repetitious and this is no exception. We're told many times over the past is obdurate and the past harmonizes. I suppose if you're going to write over 840 pages there will be repetition, but he does over do it.  All in all, if you like King's older works, you'll like this.  If you're someone who has little patience for long works, you probably won't.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|My happiness with this purchase prompted me to write my first review.   I have owned the bag for roughly a week so durability is still unknown, however at this point I don't see any pending issues.  Size, I say looking for the right bag is like searching for the Holy Grail, a very subjective personal decision depending on equipment use and body size. For me this bag is perfect for walk-around, city shooting, I don't want to carry the whole shooting match. I carry a Nikon D7000 grip attached with Nikon 80-200 2.8 attached; 2 speedlites; a Tamron 28-75mm 2.8; Nikon 50mm 1.8; memory cards, fingerless gloves (when cold) and an Ipad in a neoprene sleeve. I have room for a little more but don't like carrying more than I need. I have placed a Nikon 18-200VR in it with the above mentioned and it all fit nicely.  Build, looks good so far, as everyone had mentioned I could do without the labeled zippers, but a little gaffers tape took care of that.  I modded my bag as soon as it arrived. It has a waste belt, I cut it and the little padded tabs off as well as the chest strap and the bungee cording on the back. Yeah I can't carry a tripod or hike mtns, but that's not what I use this bag for and don't believe you should either. If I am going in the woods there are bigger better suited bags for that. This is a city bag / shoot/ hit a coffee shop bag for me.  Thats it for now, may attempt a video upload later.
B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Aubrey Drake Graham has come a long way from his acting days back on the show Degrassi, and has become one of the leading artists in Hip Hop in a such a short amount of time (3 years). Why is he so successful? Because he is Different...Not the stupid different like Lil Wayne, or over the top different like Nicki Minaj, but different because he as another talent in his arsenal which is singing. Sure Drake is not the most gifted singer but he does have an ear for melody. Drake is first and foremost a rapper but in my opinion he is more successful as a singer. \\"Take Care\\" is Drake's evolution album; Drake and his main producer Noah \\"40\\" Shebib have created a distinct mellow sound first introduced on the 2009 So Far Gone, but Drake has vastly improved and almost mastered the sound on Take Care. It is hard to describe but it is a mellow sound that is specifically designed to compliments Drake's voice and crafted so well that its hard for other people to rap/sing on. This album is a far better improvement over his debut album \\"Thank Me Later\\" released just last year, which shows how much Drake has improved as a singer, a songwriter, and an overall artist.<br /><br />This entire album is very moody and almost borderline emo, but there are instances in between where Drizzy takes a break and does some fun or at least optimistic sounding songs, but it doesn't last forever. The album starts off with \\"Over My Dead Body\\" which features fellow Canadian artist Chantal Kreviazuk, which is a nice sentimental track filled with Drake's thoughts of his success as of now. It would be almost the perfect track if Drake wouldn't sound \\"Lil Wayne\\" like. The next track \\"Shot For Me\\" talks about past relationships and the first single \\"Headlines\\" capitalizes on his own fame. I have said previously that Drake sounds much better when he uses his singing voice more and the title track \\"Take Care\\" is a perfect example of what Drake is capable of. Featuring Rihanna and a nice Gil-Scott Heron sample, this is easily one of the most artistic songs on the album, even if it basically a revamped version of Jamie xx version. The most Emo song \\"Marvin's Room\\" really demonstrates Drake's storytelling ability, with the premise being a drunk despairing over a past relationship making the girl regret what she left behind. Also after the primary song has ended, listeners are treated a surprising cameo from Kendrick Lamar delivering an interesting verse. \\"The Real Her\\" which features cameos from mentor Lil Wayne and legendary Andre 3000 following the concepts from Drakes past song Houstatlantavegas where Drake once again sings beautifully on.<br /><br />There are breaks from all the anguish Drake is spilling out (Thank God). Tracks such as \\"Make Me Proud\\" and \\"Under Ground Kings\\" (both produced by T-Minus) have a more light hearted sound and overall more optimistic view on Drakes part. The best song on this album is probably \\"Look What You've Done\\" which is a love letter to his mom. This is the most personal song Drake has ever made in his career and the story is very touching if you disregard the sloppy flow sounding rapping Drake does within the song. \\"Crew Love\\" which sounds more like Weeknd song more than a Drake song has one of the nicest productions on the entire album. Songs \\"Lord Knows\\" feat. Rick Ross is not bad, but it doesn't fit Drake's style very much and \\"The Ride\\" is okay but The Weeknd's voice in the backround can be tedious and somewhat annoying.<br /><br />This album is far from perfect sadly. One of the main problems I have with this album is Drake's rapping, even though he has grown a little bit and sounds more confident, he is suffering from what I like to call the \\"Young Money Influenzza\\". The Young Money label in my opinion is one of the (if not THE) worst alliance in Hip Hop today. Every artist on that label (besides Drake, and maybe Nicki Minaj) are neither interesting nor talented whatsoever. Drake has obviously been influenced by Lil Wayne a lotand you can tell when he is rapping. Songs like \\"HYFR\\" also feat. Lil Wayne contains some of the ugliest flows I have ever heard from Drake and this goes the same for \\"We'll Be Fine\\" feat. Birdman and \\"Cameras/Good Ones Go interlude\\" which suffer from terrible lyrics. Drake saves himself on such tracks when he is singing on the hook, but besides that the lyrics on these songs are terrible typical Cash Money Bulls***. Another problem I have is sometimes Drake delves too deep in his own despair that it winds up soundling like emo whinning bull crap. \\"Doing It Wrong\\" is a perfect example of an annoying song that I can't take much of, even the harmonica supplied by the legendary Stevie Wonder can't make it barable. The song \\"Practice\\" is a ballad remake of Juvenile's booty classic \\"Back That Azz Up\\". Making an R&B song out of a song mainly about a girls behind already sounds bad in concept. The song sounds ok melody wise but knowing that the song is an attempt to revive the golden days of Cash Money, it just ends up being corny.<br /><br />With that said, Take Care is a great sophomore album from Drake. While not perfect, this is not like any other Hip Hop album out this year, this is an album by an honest man letting the world know his own personal thoughts and problems. This album already exceeds \\"Thank Me Later\\" and is 10x better then the stupid Tha Carter IV (completely overrated) but Drake still has a long way to go as an artist, and an even longer way to go as a real MC, but regardless \\"Take Care\\" is one of the best albums of 2011.<br /><br />Top Tracks:<br />Take Care (feat. Rihanna)<br />Look What You've Done<br />The Real Her (feat. Lil Wayne & Andre 3000)<br />Marvins Room/Buried Alive interlude (feat. Kendrick Lamar)<br />Over My Dead Body (feat. Chantal Kreviazuk)<br />Headlines<br /><br />Honorable Mention:<br />Under Ground Kings<br />Make Me Proud<br />Crew Loverapping. Songs like \\"HYFR\\" also feat. Lil Wayne contains some of the ugliest flows I have ever heard from Drake and this goes the same for \\"We'll Be Fine\\" feat. Birdman and \\"Cameras/Good Ones Go interlude\\" which suffer from terrible lyrics. Drake saves himself on such tracks when he is singing on the hook, but besides that the lyrics on these songs are terrible typical Cash Money Bulls***. Another problem I have is sometimes Drake delves too deep in his own despair that it winds up soundling like emo whinning bull crap. \\"Doing It Wrong\\" is a perfect example of an annoying song that I can't take much of, even the harmonica supplied by the legendary Stevie Wonder can't make it barable. The song \\"Practice\\" is a ballad remake of Juvenile's booty classic \\"Back That Azz Up\\". Making an R&B song out of a song mainly about a girls behind already sounds bad in concept. The song sounds ok melody wise but knowing that the song is an attempt to revive the golden days of Cash Money, it just ends up being corny.   With that said, Take Care is a great sophomore album from Drake. While not perfect, this is not like any other Hip Hop album out this year, this is an album by an honest man letting the world know his own personal thoughts and problems. This album already exceeds \\"Thank Me Later\\" and is 10x better then the stupid Tha Carter IV (completely overrated) but Drake still has a long way to go as an artist, and an even longer way to go as a real MC, but regardless \\"Take Care\\" is one of the best albums of 2011.

0920668372|1.0|I am grateful to my mom for not loving me in a way this woman loves her son and I feel sorry for people loved this way. \\"I hate the fact you're growing up, I don't have a single nice word about you and seeing who you are becoming is driving me crazy, so I'll infantilize you because only if I pretend that you are little baby without character and completely dependent on me, I can love you. So you'll always be my little baby. <3\\"  No, he will not, go and see a shrink, lady, before you screw up your son. Oops, too late. To bad she died so young, I bet she'd be wonderful mother-in-law.  This book is so disturbing that it provoked me to write my first review here. Yes, it is that bad.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I absolutely can not wait for this DVD. It was released in the UK yesterday, Nov. 14, to rave reviews. I was lucky enough to be there at the Royal Albert Hall for all three performances. What a thrilling experience it was.  Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess had wonderful chemistry, and the ending, with all the Phantoms, Andrew Lloyd Weber, and Sarah Brightman was something I am glad I did not miss. I can't wait to see the close ups because the clips I've seen are fabulous. Ramin and Sierra put such passion into their work. This will absolutely put the movie version to shame. Ramin, Sierra, and the rest of the cast can actually sing! Also loved seeing Stephan John Davis in his cameo role of Don Attilo. I feel very comfortable giving this DVD and the CD 5 stars before viewing because it will be everything I viewed, but closer!

1451648537|5.0|This book inspired me on so many levels.  I loved learning and re-living the technology transformation of the last 30 years.  Wow.  I learned so much about the history of all the incredible Apple devices and in awe that Steve Jobs was so visionary.  The many discussions on other companies and leaders was incredibly powerful.  This book made me question my CEO and wonder where the visionary was at my company?  I can't say enough positive things about this book - I have recommended it to everyone I know.
0553804367|4.0|This book was perfect for me since it is divided to short chapters and each is explained in layman terms. Exactly what I expected.
1451627289|5.0|This is a fantastic read. I've been reading King for a very long time and have to say this book vaults right to top 10 (maybe top 3) on my favorites list of his work.  Being a history and time travel nut I especially loved it but even had I not been, the story would still have kept me tuning page after page.  Highly recommended!!
0321356683|5.0|I can honestly say that this book has improved my programming skill tremendously. It is divided to short items, each one packs a powerful wisdom. My boss at the startup I was working at gave me his copy and I read just one item each morning before starting my day, now almost 3 years later I bought my own copy and I'm reading it again. it's amazing that I can still learn in the 2nd read, now that I have more experience.<br /><br />Josh Bloch is just amazing, there are a lot of Java books out there, except this one was written by the same guy who designed and wrote most of the standard library.<br />If you apply Bloch's lessons, your code will be cleaner, safer, more readable, efficient and will lead to fewer bugs. guaranteed.<br /><br />The book is well written, explained using solid engineering concepts which you can pass on to your teammates,<br />and covers a wide range of topics which anyone can benefit from.<br /><br />I recommended this book to all of my engineer friends, and they all have it now and love it.<br />A must have in every Java developer's belt.
1451627289|5.0|\\"11/22/63\\", Stephen King's latest, might just be his greatest.  Seriously.  At least as far as \\"mainstream\\" fiction or \\"literature\\" goes.  Yes, it is built around a well-used SF trope, time travel, but really, the portal to the past that Jake Epping is shown in the back of an aluminum diner is only the launch mechanism for this fantastic journey. There are no monsters here, at least none that aren't human, and little or no horror in the supernatural sense that King's constant readers have come to know, love and expect. Even SK's other \\"straight\\" fiction, \\"Misery\\",  \\"Dolores Claiborne\\" and \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon\\"  come to mind, had elements of the supernatural and/or flat-out horror.  Not this time.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that 11/22/63 is boring. Quite the contrary.  Although it might seem that it would be tough to build suspense around a conclusion that seems to be inevitable, this turns out not to be the case.  Big time. I just finished playing hooky from work for a day when I read the last 400 pages non-stop (except for a couple of bathroom breaks), because I just couldn't stop.  I just kept pressing the advance button on my Kindle.<br /><br />The adjective that first comes to mind in describing 11/22/63 among SK's oeuvre is, oddly enough, \\"mature\\".  I have read every novel and anthology that King has published, plus a large number of single short stories, starting with \\"Carrie\\" in a borrowed paperback back in the late 1970s.  I have never before thought of describing his work in any of them, many good, some great and a few clunkers (some of which I have reviewed as such), as mature.  But that is the first, best word that comes to mind in describing 11/22/63.  There were others too; exciting, romantic, bittersweet and, as with all SK's stuff, well-written.<br /><br />Lee Harvey Oswald and the Kennedy assassination were obviously very well-researched, clear from the details in the text even before one gets to the afterword that describes some of the sources and methods used. The lead-up to the day of the assassination is described in great detail, along with Oswald's relationship to his family and associates, all matters of historical record (at least according to the sources cited by SK, with which most of the readers who did not like the novel disagreed emphatically). But I should point out that the facts concerning the Kennedy assassination are actually not the main focus of the novel.<br /><br />The world of 1958-1963 is described in wonderful detail, through the eyes of Jake as he gradually sheds his early 21st century armored shell and falls in love with a small Texas town and Sadie, its new young librarian.  Their love story is the centerpiece of the novel and is told with great depth, sensitivity and believability.  I'm old enough to have experienced lots of the stuff that Jake encounters in 1958 (albeit as a child) and it jives with and jogs my recollections and induces a feeling of longing for older, simpler times.  For King''s \\"Constant Readers\\", there are easter egg cameos from \\"It\\" and \\"The Langoliers\\" that I recognized.  Knowing SK, there may well be others.<br /><br />The ending is not predictable (if you say you saw it all coming you are either lying or should be a best-selling novelist) and is surprisingly satisfying.  To those who say King doesn't know how to end his novels, I say, read this one.<br /><br />Very Highly Recommended for all (even those who think they know but don't \\"like\\" Stephen King).<br /><br />J.M.

B001HN6922|1.0|I LOVED the first Cars movie and liked the good moral of the story about how having friends is more important than winning.  Cars 2 is nothing like the first one.  It's dark/scary, has lots of guns and bombs with characters saying \\"I'm going to kill you,\\" there are even parallels to water boarding.  WATER BOARDING!!!  This is such a highly controversial topic to begin with and Disney really felt it was appropriate to show the \\"Bond\\" car have liquid forced down his throat as torture??  Seriously?  Would you ever let your child watch a terrorist be tortured?  This movie is marketed for a very young audience (my son is 3 and a HUGE fan of the first movie).  On top of all the violence, there's the political message of cars consuming regular gas/fuel are \\"bad\\" and alternative fuel cars are \\"good.\\"  I am all for using alternative fuel, but this subject doesn't even belong in a kid's cartoon!  If old Mickey Mouse episodes show a warning about possible offensive content then this movie should have had a warning that Disney was about to expose our children to politics and violent scenes.  I only gave it a 1 star since that's the lowest option.
B0067H9W72|4.0|Like ANY great epic, detail is the key.  The \\"slowness\\" of each episode is a result of a simple formula.  The Everyday(slow)+the Extraordinary(zombies galore)=a mixed bag.  Even the episode or two that is Extraordinary is just a setup for the everyday and vice versa.  To the doubters, enjoy each episode for the mixed bag you get, because, in the end it'll all come together.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I think this is there best album yet, and certainly much better than their last. The two songs that really stand out is the first track \\"What You Want\\" and track number seven \\"Lost In Paradise\\". \\"What You Want\\" is an upbeat song, and is radio friendly. It's catchy, and changes tempo hear and there, so you don't get burned out on the song. \\"Lost In Paradise\\" is a showcase for Amy Lee's powerful vocals. It starts off with her singing and playing the piano, and you can hear a violin. Towards the middle of the song the rest of the band kicks in (guitar,bass,drums). Kind of like \\"My Immortal\\" the heavier version. This song will give some people the chills, because it's so good. I could see this song, along with the last track on this album \\"Secret Door\\", playing in the background to the new tv show \\"Once Upon A Time\\".   Speaking of \\"Secret Door\\", you'll find Amy Lee playing the harp on that song. Yes Amy Lee learned how to play harp, with all that downtime she had in between albums. I really like that song too, if I'm in the mood, which is usually at night. Really Evanscence is a band to hear at night, when it's dark. Anyway, the best songs besides the ones I mentioned are, \\"The Change\\", \\"My Heart Is Broken\\", \\"Sick\\", \\"Never Go Back\\", and \\"Disappear\\". But really all the songs are good in someway, just that I found that it took awhile to like certain songs. Unlike their last album, where I couldn't say that. Oh, and by the way, they have sixteen songs on this album, so you really get your money's worth. And also they added a bonus dvd, that has the video to \\"What You Want\\", along with Amy Lee explaining info on several of her songs on this album. And other stuff about the band, the studio, and the making of the video.   The only negative thing I have to say about this album, is the new band members don't really have anything special musically to add to this album. It's like they are just studio musicians (maybe they are, LOL). To compare it with basketball, it's like whenLebron James played with the Cleveland Cavs. Amy Lee being Lebron James, and the rest of the band, being the rest of the players on the Cavs (nobody really that good). O.k., the Cavs had a couple players worthy of note, but I can't say that for Evanescence. It's all Amy Lee. Her singing voice is so good, and she has some catchy tunes on piano. And now she plays the harp, amazing! She also has to duplicate her voice, for background vocals, because nobody else in the band can sing. At least Bon Jovi, has Ritchie Sambora.   Anyway, if you like Evanescence, this album is a must have, and you like the first album, but didn't like the last one, then you also should by this album. And if you never owned an Evanescence album, but like a few songs by them, then you should also seriously consider getting this cd/dvd. And if you like the band Within Temptation, or Lucuna Coil, like me, you should also score this album (cd/dvd). And if you like and watch American Idol, you should also buy this album, to listen to Amy Lee's powerful, and original vocal pipes, proving you don't need an incredible vocal range, you just need to sing different from all the rest. And it's nice to know she can do more than just sing, or let somebody write most of the songs for her. She is a singer, songerwriter, and musician.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Joanne Rowling's compelling, addictive adventure of the boy wizard has been officially translated into about 70 languages.  Each movie adapted from the seven books made about a billion bucks (excluding home video).  Total gross for home video and books has been estimated at an additional $10 billion - give or take a few million.  Today, Ms. Rowling is among the richest woman in the UK.  But that was not always so.<br /><br />When she began writing, she was essentially out of work and broke.  But during a delay on a train from Manchester to London, she said that a story fully formed percolated and spilled out on scribbled napkin notes.  And it continued to flow and flow and flow.  By luck, an obscure literary agent plucked her unsolicited manuscript from a pile and immediately was transported into the world of the story.  That first volume made publishing history - as did those that followed.  Meticulous film adaptations with detailed production design and remarkable casting, directing acting, music and effects reflected the reading experience.<br /><br />Much has been written about this pop-culture phenomenon, but perhaps the main attraction is the coming of age in a world of good and evil and danger and responsibility where fear and desire rub up against each other.  Somehow we all know that just beyond the ordinary and mundane are extraordinary wonders and mysteries and this massive tale latches onto that core theme.<br /><br />In some conservative circles, the books and movies were denounced as fostering in vulnerable young readers an unhealthy interest in dark, supernatural powers.<br /><br />The publisher, fearing young boys would be put off by a female author, used only her initials to mask her gender.  She also kept quiet about her own embrace of Christianity.<br /><br />With the release of the last half of \\"Deathly Hallows,\\" the entire story can now be enjoyed in a thrilling, magical marathon viewing extravaganza.<br /><br />Beautifully acted, the final showdown is a dazzling and satisfying conclusion to the epic drama of warring good and evil and the role of human responsibility.<br /><br />Not too much can be said about the perfect casting of young Daniel Radlciffe as Potter.  He not only matches the book cover art but also the essence of the character as portrayed on the novels' pages.  Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are similarly perfect as Potter's Hogwarts' mates.  But what's most amazing to witness, especially at one sitting, is the actual coming of age of these terrific young actors.  The stakes are very high indeed and there is no guarantee of safety for anyone when Harry is faced with the ultimate sacrifice as he makes a final stand against Lord Valdemort.  The extras on the superbly Blu-ray disc are generous.  I especially enjoyed the \\"Conversation with J.K. Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe\\" and \\"The Goblins of Gringotts.\\"  It may all end here, but now you can begin all over again anytime you wish.

B005UG542S|3.0|Although I read mostly nonfiction, I've read all the Harry Potter books, and I've seen all the movies.  The Deathly Hallows part 2 had some great moments, but it lacked important information for those fans who haven't read the series, which I highly recommend doing.  SPOILER ALERT:  GREAT:  1. Snape's death scene in the movie was handled well. After reading that scene in the book, I thought it was going to be cheesy on film - although I didn't understand why they were in a boathouse instead of the Shrieking Shack.  2. Helena Bonham Carter acting as Hermione disguised as Bellatrix by way of poly juice potion. Her work on that role should be a winner for best supporting actress.  3. Inclusion of the Prince's Tale (Snape's story), which was basically, the whole reason why Harry Potter was the boy who lived, and the one who could defeat Voldemort.  LACKING:  1. Explanation of the Deathly Hallows - Harry was in possession of all three - the Elder Wand for having won it from Draco, the resurrection stone - gave no background on where it originally came from (Voldemort's family), and the invisibility cloak, which Harry had inherited from his father, but the movie didn't even hint that HIS cloak was THE cloak. Also, since he owned all 3 deathly hallows, he was invincible, and thus escaped death. I'm not so sure that anyone watching only the movie would even understand how Harry came back to life.  2. Explanation of the last horcruxes: the goblet in the bank belonged to Helga Hufflepuff - no mention whatsoever of that rather important detail, which leads to Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem possibly being a horcrux. The snake being a horcrux - didn't show how Voldemort came into possession of the snake and why it was chosen.  3. Why Molly Weasley was at Hogwart's.   4. Snape and Minerva's duel was rather boring - Snape was chased off by 3 wizards in the book.   5. Too much screen time for the gray lady without even telling her story.  6. Draco's companion, Vincent Crabbe, in the room of requirement. Maggie Smith was battling breast cancer and managed to play Minerva, but Jamie Waylett couldn't get his act together.  7. Dumbledore's story and how he himself had sought possession of the deathly hallows. The movie shows his brother and sister, but doesn't explain why she's a child or why his brother harbors resentment.  8. AND THE BIGGEST - After Harry kills Voldemort, NO ONE seems to notice. They're just sitting around chitchatting with each other as though they're waiting for the director to shout, \\"Action!\\" Um, hello, Voldemort is gone forever. Doesn't anyone care? No cheers. No acknowledgement. No pat on the back.   Some other lacking items are also lacking from the book itself. How some of the characters were killed wasn't discussed in the book either, because everything is from Harry's perspective. He didn't witness most of the battle, because his duty was to destroy the horcruxes, so I won't blame the screenplay on that.  All in all, it's still entertaining and worth seeing, especially if you've seen all of the previous movies. Don't watch it if you've missed some of them, because you'll be lost as to what's going on.  As a side note: If anyone has a way of getting in touch with Rowling, here's an idea- a prequel TV series, \\"Hogwarts: The Marauders Years.\\" I'm aware Rowling doesn't want to write a prequel, but maybe she'd be open to leaving the actual writing to others, who simply follow her guidelines. She could approve all the scripts before the shows are produced.

Clearly, anyone can scan the missing content, and make the pirate version worth more then the official.<br />This e-book version lacks pages, illustrations, and an index. The cover is skewed.

0670022411|4.0|This is a book for adults who can read and who like to read. It is reading for pleasure.  This tale was crafted by a female writer who walked the streets of her novel and lived in the rooms of it. Remember, the best writers write from what they know! Skill and determination are the reins of discipline applied to talent.   Mixing is part of the alchemical process. This book is about mixing things. In order to do this one must drop the ideas of separation and segregation. This is the message of the book. This is the war.

I do suggest it and I would recommend it if this is the length you want.

1591396190|3.0|The blue ocean strategy includes two aspects of the weaknesses.   Firstly, the book is too simplistic and idealized. After seeing the blue ocean strategy, we all know to avoid the red ocean but to look for the blue ocean. However, in fact, the real blue ocean is not easy to find. Even if we have found the blue ocean strategy, how to make sure that our blue ocean strategy is difficult to imitate by the competitors and to keep superiority? How to keep entry barriers? For example, authors give a case about DELL Computer Corporation. DELL created a blue ocean in the mid-1990s. Dell challenged this industry logic by changing the purchasing and delivery experiences of buyers. In 2003, Dell was the undisputed market leader in PC sales, with $35.5 billion and 30 percent of the U.S. market share. But out of the case, return to reality, other computer corporations imitated DELL's blue ocean strategy quickly, and DELL returned to the red ocean again.  Secondly, the blue ocean strategy does not have too many differences from Porter's five competitive forces model. Porter's model is a basic framework and a schema to understand the broader concept of the blue ocean strategy. The blue ocean strategy is just more specific than Porter's model.   Whatever, this book is fitted for every manager, especially for the small business managers. I would like to recommend it to them.  To sum up, it is not as good as I expect, and not too many creative ideas voiced out from this book. It is more likely an aggregated highly simplified case analysis. A lot of case analysis convinced the reader at first sight; however, it may be too short to be discussed.    Yang Liu

B006671NPM|3.0|POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)<br /><br />My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />Not counting shallow effects, 18 out of screen effects extend 5% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 6 made it out to 10%. 3 OOS effects extended to 20%. My favorite is a dragon's head snapping its mouth closed at about 21:00 minutes.<br /><br />The quality of the in screen 3D is real good for a post-production (FAKE) 3D film. But it should be, they spent a small fortune having IMAX oversee 12 companies doing the 2D to 3D conversion process. However, as with all converted 3D films there are minor flaws and the cardboard cutout effect. This film also had over done 3D in at least 5 scenes and 5 more easily visible 3D flaws.<br /><br />I hope this (the ultimate effort of conversion) finally convinces the 3D industry to just use a 3D camera setup when shooting. They could have had an excellent film instead of one in the middle of the pack.<br /><br />*** Three and a half stars ***<br /><br /> MY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.

B005NS0VNU|4.0|Releasing a 40 track hits collection as holiday shopping kicks off, and weeks after their split was a good idea. It would have been an even better idea had they not dropped two other 2-disc collections in the past 8 years. Still, this would be the \\"career-spanning\\" package.<br /><br />Now with a band like REM, there's a quantity of quality songs. They were around a long time. So even at 40 songs this is bound to be missing a few favorites. However I suppose all the \\"greatest hits\\" are included. The first third of the collection is basically what the old Eponymous collection was, a track or two swapped. The bulk of the songs up to \\"Bad Day\\" could be found on their 2003 In Time best of. It's the final nine songs here that are being collected for the first time.<br /><br />There's a number of songs I wish were included here, and in my opinion a few that aren't worthy. I'd drop \\"Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\\", \\"New Test Leper\\" and \\"Life And How To Live It\\". I'd add \\"Drive\\", \\"Bang And Blame\\", \\"E-Bow The Letter\\" and \\"Daysleeper\\" if I could. Toss on \\"Wolves, Lower\\" or \\"Carnival Of Sorts (box cars)\\" too.<br /><br />Overall it's a good sampling of their work. However if you've got \\"Best Of The IRS Years\\" and \\"In Time\\", you may not need this.

Also, it seems to me that the golden nugget is missing - namely, people w/ this constellation of strengths are really good a \\"X\\". Personally, I think your time would be better spent at the local community college w/ the Strong-Campbell Interests and Myers-Briggs tests. For myself, this was not a good use of my money.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|I am amazed at the simple quality of this product from Marware.  It is not worth $39.99.  Not even close!  It is a simple plastic case with an elasticized band to hold it closed.  The folding cover is supposed to work as a stand for viewing but really doesn't work well at all. Maybe it will stay up when the Kindle Fire is in the case. The added weight might help.  This product functions as a cover,[[ASIN:B005HSG3TC Kindle Fire MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Graphite]] but I can't imagine how Marware justifies the price.  I thought it would be a much better quality product for the money.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|This movie was disturbing, but the most disturbing issue was the antagonist role not being more defined, understood, or the skin peeling not being taped.  This is a horror flick.  That is the genre.  Most Americans will not deal with subtitled flicks, I am an exception.  However, the subtitles take away from the film greatly.  Large plot minuses due to failed and way too slow sections.
0525423656|2.0|I loved the first book and was really excited when this book came out, but boy was I disappointed.  The narrative seemed to drone on and on in almost a \\"dreamlike\\" way rattling off prose after prose which for me, got really tedious.  There was a real lack of action and drama that made the first book so great.  It was super introspective from the character standpoint and just got really boring.  There was no suspense as to what was going to happen next...nothing!  A total let down when you compare to the first book.  Total waste of time.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I love this album. At first I was expecting more, I'm not going to lie. It took me a few listens to really warm up to it, but now I can't get enough. This is The new take on Santa Baby is possibly one of my favorites. It's a different feel from his small \\"Let It Snow\\" album. Michael Buble adds just a touch of new flavor and a bit of his own personality to some of the best Christmas songs out there. These are the perfect songs to put on for an evening at home just sitting in front of the Christmas tree with a mug of hot chocolate. If you're looking for a Christmas album with a bit of spice, this isn't it. This is much more romantic. If romantic and peaceful IS what you're looking for, this is surely it. If you like Michael Buble you'll at least like this album, even if you don't love it.
0811870413|4.0|Unlike most bakers who bring their bread out in the morning, Chad Robertson bakes throughout the day and serves the product to the lines of eager acolytes who stream around the block in San Francisco's Mission District at 5 pm every afternoon. It's an experience worth going out of your way for but, if you're not going to be in San Francisco any time soon, the country bread you can make with the method described here is a pretty good replica. I am a fairly experienced baker but these very detailed instructions made me comfortable with a much wetter dough than I'm used to (over 75% hydration counting the levain, for those who are into baker's measurements) and I ended up with some of my best bread ever on my very first batch.<br /><br />It is also worth reading about Robertson's meditative and soulful approach to bread, surfing and life in general. You will want to be him. You can't but you can make his bread. There are hundreds of small pictures of the bread making process and I found it quite helpful to compare my results to his at various stages.<br /><br />As others have said, this is more a guide to making bread than a cookbook... there aren't that many recipes in here. And at least one of them, the baguette recipe, has something goofy going on. You end up with over four pounds of dough which is supposed to make \\"2 or 3 baguettes\\" but really is ample for at least 6 baguettes and the result both times I've tried it has puffed up like the Pillsbury Doughboy. The bread tastes great but it's not the baguettes I am used to. I think the culprit is his use in this recipe of a poolish which in my experience makes for a very soft and puffy end product.<br /><br />Robertson isn't a professional cookbook author (though he's a pretty good writer) and he describes at length the process by which his \\"test bakers\\" helped him develop new methods for less experienced bakers working at home. It's an imperfect journey which you will need to continue through trial and error in your own kitchen. That's what happened to the fifth star. But you should still buy this book and then make the Country Bread immediately.ned to the fifth star. But you should still buy this book and then make the Country Bread immediately.
630512762X|4.0|This is your typical 90s action film that doesn't hold back.  To say the least the film doesn't leave you wanting any more action and at well over two hours it's a good thing that it has such a penchant for the genre.  Chase scenes, guns blazing, explosions, Travolta, Cage, what's not to like?  In the very opening credits we are greeted with a sinister deed dealt out by the lunatic anarchist Castor Troy to our hero of the film: Sean Archer.  What follows is a heart-racing, action-packed film of revenge and, more importantly, duality.  Can we comment for a moment on the 'Troy' 'Archer' reference.  Achilles was taken out by an arrow to his one weak spot, his heel, in the siege of Troy in Homer's grand epic work.  It seems that the duality and the interwoven lives of Archer and Troy do not just lurk beneath the surface, but in plain sight as well.<br /><br />In a sense Archer must become Troy in order to save the day and what results is a spell-binding story that has you overlooking the sometimes overly dramatic scenes that can set even the  most die-hard romantic to vomiting.  That is my one complaint about the film: it is often too dramatic.  Otherwise we are greeted with a superb control of the underlying difficulties facing the characters of this thrilling movie.  Once their roles are switched their true nature comes to the forefront of who and what they stand for and how they view each other's lives.<br /><br />Stunning camera work, use of dialogue, and suspenseful drama make up the core of this intense film and give us over two hours of excitement that are hard to forget.
0374275637|1.0|I am thoroughly disappointed with myself for having purchased this book. I would encourage any and all who are tempted to instead purchase 'In Search of Memory' by Eric Kandel.<br /><br />In contrast to that book of scientific exploration and explanation, this book is a wild series of anecdotes and theories wrapped in the comforting illusion of the scientific method to which Psychologists pay cargo-cult worship.<br /><br />As an example the author discusses a fascinating experiment whereby he observes a direct relationship between 'mental effort' and the dilation of the pupil in human subjects. A scientist, such as Kandel, would then attempt to isolate exactly how these two phenomena are related. Perhaps in an animal model, or some reduced preparation. Kahneman on the other hand merely uses this insight to play parlor tricks on his subjects guessing when they have 'given up' on the task they have been presented with.<br /><br />This book is filled with observations of behavior loosely tied to a highly speculative framework of two 'systems' of thinking. I can find little to no determination to pursue a deeper understanding of these 'systems.'<br /><br />There is a great deal of value in observing the many errors in thinking, statistical analysis, and decision making under uncertainty that Kahneman has observed over the years, it's just that he has failed to extract any of the value beyond giving the phenomena names.<br /><br />We simply do not need another half-baked framework for cognitive processes.<br /><br />Do not bother with this book.
0670824399|5.0|Roald Dahl wrote a great book called Matilda.  It's about a girl living in rough time's with a mean teacher, and mean parents.  Her teacher named Mrs.Trunchbull is so mean that she said, \\"I cannot for the life of me understand why small children take so long to grow up.  I think they do it deliberately, just to annoy me.\\"  And her parents are so abusive they didn't even know how old Matilda was!  Her dad, Mr.Wormwood, asked Mrs.Wormwood, \\"Dearest pie, how old is Matilda?\\"  Mrs.Wormwood says, \\"Four.\\" Matilda tells them that she is six-and-a-half, but then the father says, \\"You're a liar!\\"   Matilda discovered she has magic powers.  She use's this to face her problems and she never gave up.  I feel Matilda's very brave because she's only six and she smiles through a hard life.  Matilda teaches Mrs.Trunchbull a lesson by haunting her.  This shows her that she's not as tough as she thinks she is, and she learns what it feels like to be scared just like her students.  She also haunts her dad by gluing a hat on to his head, that teaches him not to mess with Matilda.   I recommend this book because it's made by Roald Dahl, who's done a great job on a kid friendly book that's heart filling and entertaining like his other books, James and the Giant Peach, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.   I personally would tell you to read this book because many kids can be a Matilda.  Many kids can have a hard life with mean parents and a mean teacher.  But you could overcome them.

Consumers expect a digital copy that can be used on their various mobile devices.  It is a travesty for those of us who purchased this particular version in order to be able to play on our iPads or other tablets to be stuck with a joke like Flixter.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|Another Great Season of The Big Bang Theory fun to have at home on DVD to satisfy each Big Bang Whim.  (See my Season One review for a recap of the show premise and main characters.) The comedic goodness continues with The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Second Season. However, as was my frustration with The Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season, the Second Season DVD still doesn't provide enough extras to make me want to buy more. Cast interviews, commentaries, reflections from the designers, are the meat and potatoes for me in regard to stellar DVD features. I want to hear more about the process of making this world come to life...but I want to be entertained while you tell me.  Big order, I know.  Yet none of these grumblings about the weak extras on the DVD can dampens my enthusiasm for this excellent 23-minute escapade of laughter. And so, this season's DVD retains a 5-star rating with the hope that in subsequent seasons, the DVD supplementals will continue to improve.  Also as with the Season One DVD, you still can and should, pause for the Chuck Lorre's Vanity Card to enjoy his weekly offering of wit and life observations.  It's the cherry on top.  From my Season One Review:  I avoided the Big Bang Theory until this year. I'm not sure why. I hadn't heard a lot of talk of it among my friends and family, nor did the seemingly endless promotions seem to ping at my radar.  Yet suddenly, there it was, leading into my other \\"late to the party\\" favorite, How I Met Your Mother.  I wish I could say I'm not a strong t.v watcher, yet as I think back to the number of sitcoms and ensemble dramas I've viewed through the years, it appears I've dedicated more of my time to the box with moving pictures than was perhaps necessary.  All to say, even with regular press, a successfully completed five seasons, and a fantastic cast of mostly well seasoned actors, I remained painfully oblivious to this quality gem...and my life was emptier for it...  The General Premise of The Big Bang Theory: Two bonafide geniuses with varying degrees of, but undeniable, social awkwardness, live across the hall from a young, beautiful any-woman, who is kind enough to gently show them a world outside of their scientific bubble and geek-topolis, yet also powerful enough to guard them from any less tolerant \\"cool kids\\".  The dialogue is ripe with geek culture references and scientific humor. Both fully immersed self-identifying brainiacs, nerds, and geeks, as well as \\"haven't touched a book since high school and hated it even then\\" types, can relax and enjoy the awkward hiccups that our four scientists experience as they try to marry their love for things \\"out of this world\\" with the realities back \\"here on earth\\".  The series regularly partners our bumbling scientists with the girl across the hall for typical neighborly conundrums (free loading wifi and ordering thai food) and less typical neighborly activities (driving to San Diego to demand back from a bully \\"unimportant things only useful in an imaginary world\\").  Kaley Cuoco (from Charmed and 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter) gives a genuine performance as Penny, the patient yet worldly girl-next-door, who takes the guys under her wing (and at times, into her bed).  Johnny Galecki (Darleen's boyfriend in Roseanne) is utterly charming and convincing as the lovable Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, who you quickly want to \\"get the girl\\".  And Jim Parsons (Emmy Winner for this role) plays Dr. Sheldon Cooper, a former child prodigy and current theoretical physicist at CalTech whose strict adherence to his own routine provides fodder for endless conflict and comedy between his friends, family, and general public.  The chemistry and polarity between these three main characters provides the springboard for most of the shows storylines and comedy.

The DVD of the Big Bang Theory: The Complete First Season doesn't contain the Behind the Scenes extras we have come to love and expect, nor does it include any commentaries, or interviews with the cast.  The only extra is a brief reflection from the two show creators: Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.  Hopefully this is amended in subsequent releases. However, watching on DVD does afford the viewer an opportunity not easily accessible without DVR during standard TV viewing: \\"Freeze Framing the Chuck Lorre's Vanity Card\\".  As in each of his previous shows, Mr. Lorre uses this final three second promo to entertain us with a witty essay on weekly observations. Have your remote standing by...and recommend to your friends and family \\"The Big Bang Theory\\".
B005E7AOHI|5.0|First of all who else in this world sounds like PRIMUS? Let alone any albums that sound anything like this one that are current??..Answer NONE. This album is truly fresh and still very innovative in many ways.   RECOMMENDED TRACKS FOR A NEW LISTENER: 3. Last Salmon Man 4. Eternal Consumption Engine 5. Tragedy's A-Comin' 7. Jilly's on Smack 8. Lee Van Cleef 9. Moron TV  DESCRIPTION OF RECOMMENDED TRACKS: \\"Last Salmon Man\\" from start to finish keeps the beat intense and goes into a break that makes you feel like your riding a cartoon boat. Then goes into an incredible couple of solos by both Les and Ler. Ler (not only on this track but the whole album really shows us his abilities) shreds it up nicely and Les's solo is best served through a great stereo because his bass pans from right to left and he uses an incredible sound effect that just makes his bass sound huge.   \\"Eternal Consumption Engine\\" This tune will have you dancing like a hillbilly on LSD. A real hit with the ladies!  \\"Tragedy's A-Comin\\" This tune has an excellent build up of an intro which leads to Les dropping one of the most bad ass bass lines I've ever heard. This tune also has some very catchy lyrics that will have you singing a long in no time! It just sneaks up on you. Overall this song keeps a great driving beat that will keep you hooked.  \\"Jilly's On Smack\\" Ler gives us one of his most trippy riffs ever on this song. You have to hear it because it's hard to describe how it sounds but it's amazing. Les also takes this song into a different realm of surrealism by introducing a breakdown section that almost sounds like he's playing a didgeridoo. The song of course talks about a tragic character who gets lost into addiction. A classic dark yet comical song by PRIMUS.  \\"Lee Van Cleef\\" This tune is probably the most catchiest track on the whole album. It's also one of the most unique sounding. Les sings about one of the most bad ass bad guys from the old western cowboy film days. this song is simpleby PRIMUS standards but you may just find yourself putting this track on repeat a lot.  \\"Moron T.V\\" This track is heavy and in my opinion each member shines on this tune. Ler however tends to stand out to me because his guitar playing is heavy but it's not a typical heavy where someone else would probably chug away on power chords with a lot of distortion Ler on the other hand uses very different sounding effects and plays some single note lines that are very interesting.   On another note this album is best served on a good stereo because the lows are excellent and punchy and Jays drumming is super clean and every nuance that he does gets put across on the recording and if your a fan of drum and bass this album will impress with you with how tight these guys are on the whole album.  IN REGARDS TO TIM ALEXANDER NOT BEING ON THE ALBUM:  I'm a huge fan of TIM ALEXANDER and I will never get enough of that mans drumming but you have to give up the respect for what JAY LANE has brought to the table. Have you seen PRIMUS LIVE lately?? JAY is a force to be reckoned with. Plus Jay has brought new life into PRIMUS and the guys are once again playing with real passion and fun. Plus if it isn't clear enough yet then let me say this....JAY IS TRULY A SICK DRUMMER HE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU!! He even added more to his drum kit and learned new techniques in order to handle Tim's parts properly and he does so beautifully.  On a personal note I have been a huge PRIMUS fan since PORK SODA and I have waited YEARS for this album. Am I satisfied? You bet your ass I am !! Plus this album came out on my birth day !!
B00516ZWRE|4.0|Pretty solid effort this time. For some reason the last couple of Saxon albums have left me a little flat. Not this one.Classic old school Saxon sound with a good upfront recording and mix thanks to a new producer.Hard to believe this band [in one form or another] has been going at it for 35 years or so and don't seem to be slowing down.Saw them in San Antonio a month or so ago and they've still \\"got it\\" on stage.My only complaint is that at 11 songs this cd is a little short. Highlights: \\"Chasing The Bullit\\" and \\"Ballad Of A Working Man\\". Best cover-noncover song: \\"When Doomsday Comes\\". An almost direct copy of Deep Purple's \\"Perfect Stranger\\" tune and even including Don Airey [ Deep Purple keyboardist] on keys. Most redundant tune:Orchestral version of \\"Call To Arms\\"[c'mon you guys what's with the cellos,oboes,and violins?

B004FOA84A|3.0|I loved this game, and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it as well. However, I completed it in about 40 minutes the first time through, and my wife finished it in about the same. The second play through of it for me was only 20 minutes.  Less than an hour of content doesn't justify more than $0.99 price for me. Needs another game, or additional content through an update.  The puzzles are fun, and the graphics are acceptable. Gameplay mechanics are reasonable and predictable in most cases.
B004D7GU3C|3.0|This is pure Ricky Martin, but wish there were not the majority of songs in Spanish.  Great music, though, for working out.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|I guess the publishers will never learn. If you pay $16.99 for the e-version of this, then you are crazy. There are other methods of obtaining this.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I ordered this on the pre-order mode.  I thought I was going to pay $24.99 but as per Amazon pre-order policy, if it ships at a discounted rate, that's what they charge you.  So I ended up paying $19.99 and saved $5.00.  Lucky me!!  GREAT movie and the visual effects are outstanding!  MUST BUY!
B004HO6HWA|5.0|This movie had  agreat story line and lots of action.  I was glad to finally see a movie even as a remake that can still hold it's own and keep your attention,  I gave it 5 starts because my boyfriend loved it and it is a guy movie, but we both enjoyed it.
1116549395|1.0|I bought this book for my husband, thinking that it was the entire book. However, when it arrived, I learned that this product is only the second volume of the book. There are actually 5 volumes that make up the entire work of \\"Les Miserables\\"!!!! Do not be blindsided before you purchase this book!   The story of Les Miserables is wonderful, of course, but unless you plan on buying the other 4 volumes to the story, getting just this one book is misleading.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app rocks... period!  Very smart idea and very well executed.  Works great on my Asus Eee pad.  Get it!
B004QX07G4|5.0|If you love Ellen, or are looking for.a nice, light-hearted \\"read\\", you will really enjoy this book.  I think itd make a GREAT gift and put a smile on anyones face.
B005POK858|4.0|I had been planning to buy this game for some time and was really excited to see it as the free app of the day.  The game play is fairly well balanced, and the graphics are quite impressive.  The only things keeping me from giving this a 5 star review is the battery use.  It really seems to drop my battery quite fast, almost to the point where I have to play with the charger plugged in.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is alot of fun. Basically you play levels in which you assembly levels of plants to fight against zombies. There are many strategies one can use and you can then unlock other plants for your arsenal.   It does drain your battery life but aside from that it's a great game apart from the usual angry birds.

B00006JKOM|4.0|If you are a Tull fan, you have never paid much attention to the critics. This much reviled 1976 record actually holds up very well and still sounds fresh and interesting today. The addition of John Glascock made this Tull's strongest musical line-up ever and there is magic to be heard between he and drummer Barrimore Barlow. Martin Barre easily outclasses most of his peers here, but the real revelation is just what a great piano player John Evan was. It is true that the story line of this concept album is convoluted, but that doesn't matter- these songs are some of the most tuneful in Anderson's canon. This record is unlike anything in Tull's catalog and is worth a listen.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Worth the 99 cents it makes you think but it's not extremely difficult. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles
B004XGN8W4|1.0|Unfortunately I have purchased this product and have been struggling since than.The customer service is a complete disaster.They are willing to cooperate only until the return policy lasts.As soon as it expires is hardly possible to contact any of the companies assistant.I had several issues with the product quality itself and was not able to get any customer support from the company at all.The only thing i got for spending 300$ were promises from Travis Brown (operation coordinator) that my problem will be taken care of. I just want to warn people from buying the product. For the amount of money that the product costs the company could at least have provided decent level of quality and customer service.Overall I would like to express my strong dissatisfaction with the purchase.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Bradley Cooper does a fantastic job in this film. He is virtually in every scene and he is magnificent at holding the attention of the viewer as this strange tale unwinds. This is not small feat because watching someone for two hours can certainly become a drag if the actor or actress is not able to constantly evoke energy and tension as the narrative develops. I have never seen the guy in a film before but he certainly convinced me of his skills in this film.   The story is witty, a story of a deadbeat writer who can't write and who has run off his girlfriend, played to perfection by Abbie Cornish. I have never seen this lady in a film before but she holds her own. Back to the story - Eddie Morra, the dead-beat writer, is offered some pill by his ex-wife's drug dealing brother. The pill makes every synapse in the brain work overtime and thus every thought, fact, and memory are now accessible at lightening speed. However, like all drugs, what goes up must come down. This film is a nice parable about the actions of drugs, particularly the message that nothing is free in life. Before long, Eddie is involved in more dangerous situations than you can count, and this provides much of the drama of the film.   I gave the film 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending was too nicely wrapped up. I would have preferred an ending that was as dirty and gritty as the majority of the film, but hey, some folks like their movies to end in a nice pretty tied up package. It is a highly entertaining film with a highly talented actor carrying the story from beginning to end.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|this albun is definately her best. all of the are great from the first one to the last one. i'm that chick is so powerful, work it man sensual, motivation, you all already know, lay it on me sexy as hell. feeling me right now( who doesn't like this song has got to be crazy). turn it up, a good dancing track. take a listen to all of the night and take your love to your room. the rest you will have to know by yourselves
B005J7K964|5.0|The 80's was such a cool period with music and movies and Giorgio Moroder captured it with his restoration of the silent sci-fi classic. Because the film had been heavily edited when it was released in the states back in the 1920's and footage was thought to have been lost. Moroder used modern music and footage that had been found, and added some color and sound effects, giving the film a modern taste. I had fell in love with Moroder's version and the music (Pat Benetar's \\"Here's My Heart\\" has been burned in my soul ever since). I had worn out my tape, hoping against hope with the invention of the DVD that it will return. Imagine my surprise when my wishes have been answered! There are some cool treats for the die-hard fan of Mororder's film and although the music comes out a bit hammy at times (Freddy Mecury's Love Kills makes you cringe just a tad), it's a very nice trip down memory lane. Purist of the non-Moroder version may not be happy with this version (Especially since they found a nearly complete version of the film a few years back), but it's wonderful to watch this.
0439023521|3.0|Honestly I have not read this book, but from the trailers and reviews...  This story sounds like a version of Battle Royale.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Ever since drakes first album he has proven to be a game changer in the rap industry. Drakes style is so enormous almost any thing he does sounds amazing. Take Care isnt like lil waynes carter 4 its soft melodic but full of amazing lyrics. Listening to this album i realized with Drake you never know what he is going to do. Listening to Marvin s room one min then 2 tracks later im hearing we'll be fine. At first i didnt like how he kept changing up on me but thats what makes drake awesome. With lil wayne when you buy an album you know what your gonna get drake is the complete opposite. So stop reading my review and buy this album you will enjoy it and it was well worth the wait!
B005OGYHB8|5.0|After five albums with GN'R, two with Snakepit, two with Velvet Revolver and one solo, Slash has released his first official live album \\"Made In Stoke\\" (many shows were recorded and available at concerts). This two-disc set traces Slash's entire career with each stage recieving attention. More obscure songs from Snakepit were played at the show, over more well-known songs from Velvet Revolver, which may not be to everyone's liking, but with only 21 songs to pick from, the setlist can't please everyone. Slash's rendition of \\"The Godfather,\\" a staple from Guns N' Roses \\"Use Your Illusion\\" tour is a nice touch.<br /><br />On this performance, each song song blends seamlessly into the next, as Slash's band make these songs their own, never seeming like a cover band. In his detailed liner notes, legendary rock critic Malcolm Dome seems to confer, noting that Slash and singer Myles Kennedy have \\"been able to reinvent the singer's back catalog.\\" Kennedy, from the band Alter Bridge, is a polished and powerful singer and is able to add his own signature to these songs without ruining them. While Kennedy sang two songs on Slash's debut, he is set to be the sole singer on Slash's next album, which should be something to look forward to.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Slash fans and rock fans in general.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is one of the best books I've ever read. Full of amazing stories, incredible characters, and loads of useful information, it was just the inspiration I needed to get back into running everyday. I recommend this book for anyone and everyone who has ever enjoyed or wanted to enjoy running.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. I bought two.  One for me and one as a gift. This is one of those romantic comedies that I could watch repeatedly and never get tired of. Yes, it's a holiday film but I think it can e enjoyed year round.  the scene with Hugh Grant is one of my favorites.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|I love baseball. Played 14 seasons growing up. Even helped win some championships. Batting was always my favorite. There's nothing more intense than standing there, staring down the pitcher, bat twisting between your palms, waiting for the ball to come whipping out of that hand at insane speeds. Fielding was good too. I mostly played pitcher, first, second, shortstop, third, left, right, and center. Plus, when my dad was the manager, every night he'd look over all of the players' stats with me and spend hours agonizing over how to arrange the team to create the perfect fun/success ratio.<br /><br />What I'm saying is, I know a thing or two about baseball, so when I go to a movie on the subject, I expect a lot, and if they don't get it right, I'll tear into it with a passion.<br /><br />They got it right.<br /><br />But then again, it almost wasn't a baseball movie. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane at a time when the team's just lost its three star players. Faced with the difficulty of getting new hotshots on a bare bones budget, Beane turns to economy major Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Brand convinces Beane that stars don't win games. Runs win games, and runs aren't scored with big hits and amazing plays in the field. They're scored by getting on base.<br /><br />Beane takes this advice to heart and throws out all the conventional wisdom of baseball sages, willing to hire players who don't know anything about fielding as long as they can take pitches and end up with a walk. Most of the film is about people who think they know baseball not believing in this new system and Beane trying to stick with it in the face of early failure. Like I said, it's not a baseball movie.<br /><br />But The Social Network was a movie about computer programming, and if they can make that exciting, I guess they can do it with anything. Brad Pitt helps with a great performance as the conflicted manager, and Jonah Hill is surprisingly good. The success of the film rests squarely on their shoulders, and while shots of endless statistics scrolling across a computer screen are a little cheesy, they're not that bad. As the film builds up the hopelessness of being such a monetarily poor team, you can't help but root for them. Right from the beginning, you'll be emotionally hooked, and it won't let up until the very end.<br /><br />One of the cool differences about this underdog story is that the characters aren't stars. The power wasn't inside them all along. Instead, you're rooting for the players to get walks, to get hit by pitches, to hit scrappy singles, to allow runs to score on a bunt and take the easy out. The movie gets around this by making the climax not about a championship, but about the potential for a record-breaking winning streak, and man is it exciting.<br /><br />Another key difference is that, for something advertised as a pure sports drama, it's surprisingly funny. I think I laughed harder at this than at The Hangover 2. In fact, I think it's the funniest movie I've been to this year.<br /><br />This movie makes you believe. It's makes you believe on the same level as Remember the Titans or any of the great sports movies, except you believe not in the players, but in the power of statistics, and for some reason you care. When the other characters in the film refuse to believe, when they work at every opportunity to undermine and diminish our hero, Statistics, you want to punch them in their grubby little faces. I love when a film can really make me despise somebody, and Moneyball pulls it off.<br /><br />If you love baseball or Brad Pitt or sports movies or economics or feeling emotions or laughing or good cinema in general, go see this movie. It's worth your time.ndless statistics scrolling across a computer screen are a little cheesy, they're not that bad.

B005HI7NP0|5.0|I wasn't sitting around all year saying,\\"when is Betty Wright coming out with a new album?\\" and neither was anybody else except Betty Wright and the Roots. I am so glad they did. Betty Wright:The Movie is simply one of the best of 2011. Her voice is incredible. I had forgotten how great of a singer she is. The Roots continue to show that R&B needs real instruments and real musicians. The album sounds as if Betty was standing there, singing in front of a live band. The song writing is so good. I was really transported back in time, not because it sounds old but because it sounds so good. Too many of our modern Soul/R&B acts spend so much time trying not to sound old that they miss out on sounding good. Thank you Betty Wright for making music that sounds good, it's kind of hard to find nowadays.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It starts off with simple concept, cut rope, collect stars,  drop candy to hungry thing. Great pacing, adding new ways to swing, blow, pull, drag, the candy through 3 stars to the hungry monster.  A must play.
0470876417|5.0|I just finished reading the book and : WOW ! It's packed with interesting ideas exposed in a clear and engaging way. The book itself is very beautiful, with a lot of pictures and patterns who wonderfully illustrate the ideas. Like I said, it's the Ipad of strategy book : it does the job, it's easy to use, and it's beautiful (and it's white too...). A must-have.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Finally the most anticipated album of the year is here!.... i was disappointed that the release date was pushed back to this very same day November 15th,2011. When i found out it was leaked i wanted to download it and listen to the whole album. BUT I DIDN'T! i kept myself together to hear it on the 15th! and now that i have it in my hand, listening to it in my car i can surely tell you that i am not disappointed at all I'M GLAD I WAITED!, Drake sticks to his roots the sound and feel to his music brings a part of me back home to Toronto.<br /><br />I highly recommend picking up this album if you haven't already, for those of you that downloaded it illegally and listened to it when it was leaked, what is wrong with you?<br /><br />I guess i'm not one to talk, we've all done it before, but i have started to buy CD's again to get that CD quality which is how all music should be listened to. I paid 11.99 plus tax which came up to about 13 bucks and i didn't feel ripped off at all.<br /><br />TAKE CARE OVOXO!
B0001I562I|5.0|A little cheesy, but this movie takes me back to my childhood! Watching it as an adult, I understand all the jokes now! Gotta love the 80s culture references!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I loved watching this great musical again, having watched it when it first aired in a theater.   The music and cast are great!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|...but when I do, I prefer She & Him.<br /><br />Simple arrangements and fine singing make this album pleasing to listen to.<br />No blaring music or screeching vocals.<br /><br />This album is peaceful, just like the season it is intended for.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A fun addictive puzzle game, inventive levels.  Excellent mind exercise. Strategic thought builder.  The full version offers neat additional levels.
030788743X|5.0|Go read it now! Go. Seriously, stop reading this and go read it. If you are a nerd and a geek in any area or aspect you will love this book. I know i did. Best book I've read in a long long time.
B005OZ4E3A|5.0|Laura Pausini's new CD Inedito comes in three versions An Italian, Spanish and a Deluxe that has both. I have the deluxe version and I love it. Both Italian and Spanish are beautiful languages and Laura has a wonderful voice. She has a voice that one falls in love with right away. Inedito has a great selection of songs, and some of the best are Inedito, Benvenuto/Bienvenido, and Bastava/Bastaba  All the songs are very good. I highly recommend this CD.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I rely on CalenGoo daily. CalenGoo works better on my Incredible than any other calendar that I tried. It syncs with Google Calendar which I have synced with Outlook. Range of views is good. Has a wide variety of widgets. It syncs with Google Tasks. It is not a battery hog. Wide range of items can be customized, everything from colors to reminders, and will sync with multiple accounts. Creator of app is responsive, I have been told by someone who had a problem. Only phone app I ever bought about which I think it was money really well spent.

B005NS0VNU|5.0|After reviewing R.E.M's final original album of new music \\"Collapse Into Now\\" back in March of 2011 (4 stars, by the way), I put the album away and didn't think much about it. After all, the indie rockers who put the tiny town of Athens, Georgia on the map have been rocking for over thirty years, so I figured they were just going through a lull with this odd misstep.<br /><br />It was their sudden and quiet announcement of their disbanding on their band's website only five months later simply blew me away, and I was suddenly reminded that here was one of the last bands from that era to be still playing continuously (and almost virtually intact) all that time despite the drag of time, surviving many of their pioneers and many of their peers, from Television to the Talking Heads to the Velvet Underground - even the record label they first signed up with, I.R.S Records, folded some fifteen years ago!<br /><br />My impressions of the band during that time have varied from the great (1988's \\"Green\\" will forever be my indie \\"Gone with The Wind,\\" as I played it to death when I first got it and made me re-think a great many things in my life) to the just plain blah (and let's face it, 2004's \\"Around The Sun\\" almost choked them out, they admitted that much), but they have always been one thing to even the most nominal of listeners: they were a band of musicians who provoked you to think thoughts bigger than the average band and made the travelogue of life worth taking just one more step, even though it has been - at least for me sometimes - through some pretty dangerous waters.<br /><br />This album is their last letter of remembrances, a plea for you to remember memories lost, and to leave some things that are best left there behind you.<br /><br />R.E.M. may never have been the screaming angst of Nirvana or the entirely swallowed bottle of sleeping pills at end of the party of the Violent Femmes, but they were an original, and they sang their songs out of the inspiration to invite you into their odd slice of the world, from observances ranging from wanting to pee during a long drive to the fantasy world of Andy Kaufman's mind, and from wanting you to look at the world as not just yours but as we are all together, part of a much bigger collective that we can all share together if we are responsible enough to vote, to think green before it was ever ever ever popular, and to care for the animals and most of all, to sing and dance really fast and really crazy as the end of the world approached.<br /><br />The band personally selected the songs from 15 albums over 30 years of music, and instead of just putting up the hits (that you can quickly reference on their wonderful \\"In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003\\" compilation album), they really went all out to give you some really enjoyable moments from their history that they liked, not just because they were popular. Three new songs are included: \\"Hallelujah,\\" \\"A Month of Saturdays\\" and \\"We All Go Back to Where We Belong,\\" as they were recorded after their final album release.<br /><br />Where did they get the title from, you may ask? It came from a quote by Peter Buck in 1988, \\"R.E.M is part lies, part heart, part truth and part garbage.\\"<br /><br />There are 40 really great selections of songs on the general release (and if you buy it at the iTunes Store, you get a third disc of 11 bonus music videos). Here's the track list and which album they came from:<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />01 \\"Gardening at Night\\" - 3:29 (from Chronic Town, 1982)<br />02 \\"Radio Free Europe\\" - 4:06 (from Murmur, 1983)<br />03 \\"Talk About the Passion\\" - 3:23 (from Murmur)<br />04 \\"Sitting Still\\" - 3:17 (from Murmur)<br />05 \\"So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)\\" - 3:15 (from Reckoning, 1984)<br />06 \\"(Don't Go Back To) Rockville\\" (Edit) - 3:55 (from Reckoning)<br />07 \\"Driver 8\\" - 3:23 (from Fables of the Reconstruction, 1985)<br />08 \\"Life and How to Live It\\" - 4:06 (from Fables of the Reconstruction)<br />09 \\"Begin the Begin\\" - 3:28 (from Life's Rich Pageant, 1986)<br />10 \\"Fall on Me\\" - 2:50 (from Life's Rich Pageant)<br />11 \\"Finest Worksong\\" - 3:48 (from Document, 1987)<br />12 \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" - 4:05 (from Document)<br />13 \\"The One I Love\\" - 3:17 (from Document)<br />14 \\"Stand\\" - 3:10 (from Green, 1988)<br />15 \\"Pop Song 89\\" - 3:04 (from Green)<br />16 \\"Get Up\\" - 2:39 (from Green)<br />17 \\"Orange Crush\\" - 3:51 (from Green)<br />18 \\"Losing My Religion\\" - 4:26 (from Out of Time, 1991)<br />19 \\"Country Feedback\\" - 4:07 (from Out of Time)<br />20 \\"Shiny Happy People\\" - 3:44 (from Out of Time)<br /><br />Disc 2<br />01 \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" - 4:06 (from Automatic for the People, 1992)<br />02 \\"Everybody Hurts\\" - 5:17 (from Automatic for the People)<br />03 \\"Man on the Moon\\" - 5:13 (from Automatic for the People)<br />04 \\"Nightswimming\\" - 4:16 (from Automatic for the People)<br />05 \\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" - 4:00 (from Monster, 1994)<br />06 \\"New Test Leper\\" - 5:26 (from New Adventures in Hi-Fi, 1996)<br />07 \\"Electrolite\\" - 4:05 (from New Adventures in Hi-Fi)<br />08 \\"At My Most Beautiful\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:35 (from Up, 1998)<br />09 \\"The Great Beyond\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 5:06 (from Man on the Moon, 1999)<br />10 \\"Imitation of Life\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:57 (from Reveal, 2001)<br />11 \\"Bad Day\\" - 4:05 (from In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003, 2003)<br />12 \\"Leaving New York\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 4:49 (from Around the Sun, 2004)<br />13 \\"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:11 (from Accelerate, 2008)<br />14 \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:23 (from Accelerate)<br />15 \\"&Uuml;berlin\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 4:15 (from Collapse into Now, 2011)<br />16 \\"Oh My Heart\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe, Scott McCaughey) - 3:21 (from Collapse into Now)<br />17 \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 2:45 (from Collapse into Now)<br />18 \\"A Month of Saturdays\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 1:40<br />19 \\"We All Go Back to Where We Belong\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:35<br />20 \\"Hallelujah\\" (Buck, Mills, Stipe) - 3:42<br /><br />So with that in mind, considering that this might just be the last time we hear from the band who influenced a great many things in pop culture for over three decades, I have to give this final release by them five amazing stars.<br /><br />After their long-time contractual obligations to Warner Bros. ended, they closed the door and never looked back, as they secretly knew this was it, and what we have here is the last remnant of what they consider some of their finest moments in their entire history. Oddly enough, \\"A Month Of Saturdays\\" talks about the work week being done, as Michael Stipe's forever droning vocals ask, \\"I want a month of Saturdays, gimme a weekend, weekend, weekend...\\"<br /><br />After thirty years and a catalog of music 10 indie bands would be jealous of, they deserve to find their quiet moments and peace.

Oddly enough, \\"A Month Of Saturdays\\" talks about the work week being done, as Michael Stipe's forever droning vocals ask, \\"I want a month of Saturdays, gimme a weekend, weekend, weekend...\\"<br /><br />After thirty years and a catalog of music 10 indie bands would be jealous of, they deserve to find their quiet moments and peace.

B004LZFWJO|2.0|Even after reading the directions it was not apparent how to make a match in this game. It was quickly uninstalled. The game plays nothing like what it said it would play like.
B005JLN9ZI|2.0|It should have come as no surprise that after releasing Thank Me Later, Drake would go out to produce a sophomore album as soft as his solo debut. There's a couple tracks that catch my attention, but as a whole, Drake is too soft on this album, especially after coming out with some pretty dope singles recently like The Motto and Headlines. I even liked his features on Carter IV. But...it's unfortunate...as long as I've waited for this release date...as quickly will I be pleased to watch it go.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Carry a ton of gear easily and securely anywhere. I have a problem with having too much gear with me, no matter what the destination. This bag makes it easy to bring it all with you wherever you're going, hiking, biking, travel.<br /><br />I carry 1 body with lens, 1 additional lens, shotgun mic, audio recorder, external flash: all in the main compartment. Then you've got several other pockets to stick card readers, memory cards, filters, flash gels, small light modifiers, etc. Just an idea of what you could fit in this bag.
0385534639|5.0|One of the few books I've been really sad to finish.  This one's out of left field, utterly captivating and a complete neuro-trip for the imagination.  Am only afraid some Hollywood hack will start slavering over the plot and try and film it... and lose the magic. Please may it not happen.
037582913X|4.0|Growing up this was always my favorite and most memorable book. i recently purchased this not only for my newborn, but also for a friend. I gave it four instead of five stars because there was some light scribilling on the inside cover.  otherwise-great condition!
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I own 6 seiko watches (both automatics and quartz), and had a very good experience with all of them, until I purchased this one. I did not think much about puchasing the watch with a movement from Malaysia (big mistake!), because it is supossed to be built to Seiko quality standards.  Well, date mechanism does not work (both day of the week and day of the month), which is very annoying. Contacted the seller (Imperial Watches), and all I got as response was a recommendation to send it to Seiko for service. It is a logical solution, but 1) should have expected some more service (I had another issue with a watch in the past, and got far better service from another of Amazon's sellers) and 2) I am not supossed to have this problem in the first place!!!!  If you are interested in this product, think twice about these Malaysia movements and Imperial Watches.  Hope this helps you make a good buying decision.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Great games to cure the nostalgia bug- the problem I have is you only get ONE game for free. You will need to pay for additional games. My issues are with the marketing more so than the product. You DO receive the app for free but it is useless unless you get games along with it. It is really a marketing ploy.   The product description DOES say it only comes with one game so once again we are reminded to read descriptions thoroughly. All in all I have seen worse tricks and it is just a free app.   I would recommend downloading it to see if you think additional games warrant the .99/each price tag.
0439023513|1.0|I was under the impression that Scholastic published books appropriate for young adults. This book is recommended for readers age 13 and up. I am 27 and I found myself very literally, and I suppose ironically, sick at Chapter 27. A faithful movie rendition of Mockingjay would be rated a hard R or NC-17. The graphic violence is that pervasive and appalling.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a miserable read and misleadingly marketed.
B005POK858|4.0|graphics aren't very good all. it looks bad honestly. but the plot is interesting. that's a plus. not bad for being free!
B005HV6Y84|4.0|So far have enjoyed listening to this soundtrack. Love track one. It is one of my favorites. This soundtrack seems a lot more upbeat than the previous soundtracks. I am enjoying it but not getting the same feel. One of the songs is a rap, which is totally out of character (IMHO). Looking forward to seeing the movie!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game was my second purchase and is still one of my favorites. Great tower defense game. Fixed positions (you can only build where you're allowed to). Works great on the tablet. A+
B005DR64QE|4.0|Not sure why this got some bad reviews. This is a very good action thrller with a lot of action. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Has a few surprises as well. Nicholas Cage turned in a good performance. I do recommend this movie.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|probably one of the best albums released in the past ten years...amazing!  Watch out...she's going to get all the grammies this year!
B005POK858|5.0|Other droid 2 users complained about heat or restarting issues, yet I have seen nothing of the such. I've played about an hour straight, let the screen turn black while taking a bathroom break, came back and it still came back up where I left it. No bugs so far (although, i set my droid to turn off after 2 min rather than standard 1min and turned off the transition effects(in screen settings) because they feel like a waste of time and energy). It seems like a great beginning to a Final Fantasy style game. Not to mention the Lord of the Rings Easter Egg in the first cave you are sent to... &quot;The Ring of Power&quot;. Honestly, I love it so far.
B005POK858|5.0|okay anyone complaining is being ignorant. What an awesome game. Remember this is an android game! This is good even if it wasn't a phone game. I am very impressed. I played Symphony of Eternity first and like it. I think Eve of the Genesis is just as good if not better. The story line is much better, I like not having the screen touch to move (personal choice), graphics just as cool, the wording when characters speak is much better. Price is good for this kind of game for sure.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|(This review will probably be duplicated by Amazon for other offerings of Deathly Hallows Part 2 than the one I am writing about, but if the other offerings give you a DVD or Blu-ray AS WELL AS Ultraviolent, my following comments still apply.) Some reviewers are very critical of this 3-Disc + Ultraviolent special because of concerns about Ultraviolent. It does not really matter what one thinks of Ultraviolent. I just received my order and you get a regular DVD of the movie AND a Blu-ray disc of the movie plus a disc of the special features. Ultraviolent is AN ADDITIONAL OPTION that you do not need to pursue unless you want to and are able to. Just watch the DVD or Blu-ray of the movie just like you watch any other DVD or Blu-ray. If you decide to do that and not use the Ultraviolent option, the price is still very reasonable. No problem. As for the movie itself, I think it is great.
B002YVAT72|3.0|Let me start by saying that this is a beautiful turntable.  The piano black finish is elegant looking.  That said, I only kept this turntable a few hours and returned it.  No matter what I did or how closely I followed the instructions I could never get the sound to come through the speakers of my computer.  (Windows 7)  I could live with that if the player had a headphone jack but it does not. I could never get the records to copy to iTunes either.  Maybe it was user error, or maybe I got a defective unit.  All I know is, it was turning out to be much too difficult and too much of a headache for the simple converter I was looking for.  I returned this one and bought a different turntable by a different manufacturer and I am very happy with it.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|The author includes some good ideas to get started on a minimalist life style. She is pretty funny in her stories to illustrate how we can handle some things around the holidays and how to not get more junk.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|So I saw the preview. It looked good. The movie is NOT good once it gets past what you see in the preview. Saoirse Ronan plays a girl who is being hunted by the CIA and apparently has spent about 13 of her 14 or so years in a cabin with her father someplace above the Arctic Circle where no one ever goes. She is being constantly trained in shooting, fighting, and other survival skills as well as multiple languages.  First few problems: She has apparently never seen ANYTHING outside of the woods around their cabin. So while really good at shooting reindeer, she would never have seen anything like a TV, a car, or a phone. Their cabin is strictly a kerosene lights and woodstove operation. This seems not the best prep for getting along anyplace outside of an Innuit village. Ms. Ronan is also on the light and short side for her age. The concept of her fighting grown men is a little ahhh - well OK it's a movie. Then she gets to the real world and the movie just dies. It seems a REALLY bad remake of La Femme Nikita with all the techno music and flashing lights. Hanna acts like a cross between the Terminator, 7 of 9, and a lost 7th grader on a field trip. She can recite her (fake) life story by rote, but is utterly clueless at any human interaction and is also terrified by electric fans and TV sets. Meanwhile Cate Blanchet has a southern accent that wanders all over the south from Texas to Virginia. Chases - fights - flashing lights - the end.
B005POK858|5.0|Everything is going great do far in this JRPG. I have only played for an hour and I love it! Smooth so far. Droid X
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I just received this case today; It feels very cheap.  I don't think its cost Marware more than 2 bucks to make this case ( and that is being generous).  I feel like I got ripped off, and there is no way I can justify keeping this case for 40 bucks   This case is definitely being returned.
B005POK858|4.0|I am enjoying having a great RPG on my phone, BUT unfortunately there is a bug that turns the sound off after a little while and if you try to turn it up the phone reboots. That's usually my key to exit the game and let it cool down in which case after about 10 min I can control the volume without it crashing. Worth it? Sure why not? It was free!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I came upon this miniseries while browsing on Netflix and thought it was about the American Civil War era as previous reviewers have noted.  Extremely well-acted and the attention to set and costume details are wonderful. I, too, am a fan of Pride and Prejudice and the like and this story ranks right up there.  I am buying a dvd of North & South as a present for my folks.  Also check out Bleak House, Cranford, and Downton Abbey. The Brits rule when it comes to costume period drama!!
B005GP7F8Y|1.0|W  A  F  J .   Grab a VHS copy and smear Vaseline on your screen to replicate the effect of this Blu Ray
B004GYY714|5.0|Few bumpy issues on previous releases, but is great now.  Use this 3-4 times a day.  Great on battery and clarity is great.  Love they way you can pick from multiple bitrate streams if in a bad reception zone.  My favorite app by far!
B00486070K|5.0|Easy to use, easy to install.  I use it daily with a MacBook Air and other hardware when a wired connection or dual connectivity is required.  Not too badly priced either when compared to other apple hardware addons.
6305047529|5.0|Although author James Thurber had serious misgivings about MGM's adaptation of his story, \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\\" (1947) turned out to be undeniably terrific entertainment. The wonderful Danny Kaye is perfect as Thurber's hopelessly daydreaming character as his fantasies open up visually into amusing heroics (the \\"tipocketica\\" sound effect thematically running through each fantasy). Seemingly, the daydreams are the only way of escape from milquetoast Walter's oppressive life, complete with a domineering mother, demanding fiance, and redundant job (writing suspense stories). The fun really begins when a woman (blond bombshell Virginia Mayo) bursts into his life, and suddenly, poor Mitty is thrust in the middle of a very real espionage situation, frought with danger. It's then fun to watch wide-eyed Kaye get tugged & pulled between what is his normal, henpecked existence, and his wobbling chance to beat the odds and become a true hero.   The supporting cast (including the sinister presence of Boris Karloff) is top notch, and the story (particularly the fantasy sequences) benefit from the bright sparkle of a glossy MGM production.   Definitely a Kaye classic that should be included in any fan's collection!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|If you haven't seen this video, and are interested in how our banking system and government have worked together to lead to our current (2011) financial depression, then this is a MUST SEE VIDEO!  I recently rented this video and now have purchased my own copy to share with friends.  It is amazing!  I think every member of congress and our president should watch this and answer questions about the information presented in it. (I'd love to see a national debate format where they answered questions about either their involvement or what they would do to fix the problems. OUTSTANDING VIDEO, The banks got deregulation and look where it got the average worker/consumer.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I cannot say enough good things about this video.  Get it, watch it and share it with friends and loved ones!
B005UT29Z0|1.0|depressing, slow, unhappy--Can't say much good about this movie.  Should have known it was a downer when Kevin Spacy starts off crying about his dog.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Although it looks exactly the same as when Harry Potter 7, Part 1, came out, the +Digital Copy on the box is very misleading this time around. It's not iTunes compatible and for me, that's a deal breaker. A pain to deal with an extra step, but if you contact UltraViolet via their customer support link, they will email you an iTunes code.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|There is a somewhat apt description of the term \\"entropy\\" that has stuck with me over the years. \\"If you add a teaspoon of fine champagne to a vat of sewage, what you have is a vat of sewage. And if you add a teaspoon of sewage to a vat of fine champagne, what you have is -- a vat of sewage.\\"  So, as good as SOME of the pieces on this CD are, the concept of entropy unfortunately reduces it to the aural equivalent of, well, \\"sewage\\" strikes even me as a bit harsh, so I'm going to go with, hmm, let's say \\"cold oatmeal.\\"  Let's get the bad news out of the way first: \\"SANTA BABY\\" IS AN INVITATION FOR SANTA CLAUS TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU IN EXCHANGE FOR EXPENSIVE GOODIES! There just is NOT any way to perform this song that doesn't imply that there's something in it for the man in the red suit if he \\"checks off [the] Christmas list.\\" Michael, the fact that you tried to is just embarrassing, and you should be ashamed of yourself for not 86ing it from the album. You want to do a Christmas song about being greedy, cover Pearl Bailey's \\"A Five-Pound Box of Money\\".  Next up: Nice arrangement of Ave Maria, but whoever wrote the information in the liner booklet should be aware that it wasn't written by \\"Trad.\\" It was written by Franz Schubert, and it's disrespectful to the music and the composer to not mention that. And Michael, your Latin is HORRENDOUS! I've heard Irish priests who pronounce \\"gratia plena\\" better than you did. And the \\"h\\" in \\"in hora mortis nostrae\\" is SILENT. Seriously, Nat Cole, when he sang a song in a foreign language that he didn't understand, had enough respect for his listeners to learn how the words were supposed to be pronounced. You know, just in case somebody who KNEW the proper pronunciation happened to put the record on.  \\"Blue Christmas\\" is a bit jarring; the orchestra sounds like a New Orleans jazz band that specializes in funerals was kidnapped and dragged into Sun Records to accompany an Elvis impersonator (also: Auto-Tune! BAD Elvis Impersonator!No fried peanut butter and banana sandwich for you!)   \\"Cold December Night,\\" eh? Aww, how cute, Michael wrote a Christmas song. Let's hang it up on the refrigerator, right next to George Michael's \\"Last Christmas.\\" I'll tell you, it'll be a cold December night in Hell before that makes its way onto the holiday rotation in MY house.  There's a small problem with the version of \\"Mis Deseos/Feliz Navidad\\" that appears on the disc, I'm trying to put my finger on it... oh yeah, now I know; it has the song \\"Feliz Navidad\\" in it. Other than that, it's a pretty listenable track.  Some standouts do appear on the CD. I never thought I'd ever like a song called \\"All I Want For Christmas\\" unless what the singer wanted was two front teeth, and I blame Mariah Carey for that. Michael's rendering of \\"All I Want For Christmas is You\\" makes that song listenable for me; congratulations, Michael, very well done (pity about the fact that your voice was subjected to an Auto-Tuner, another one of those entropy things I mentioned above). A few years ago, Barry Manilow recreated the Bing Crosby/Andrews Sisters arrangement of \\"Jingle Bells,\\" an effort that, while note-for-note faithful (and possibly BECAUSE of that) was kind of embarrassing to listen to. The jazzed-up version Michael gives us, with the Puppini Sisters updating the Andrews Sisters with a little Boswell Sisters accent, admirably avoids that problem. It's a very fun listen. Also a very fun listen is Michael and Shania Twain teaming up for the Drifters-esque arrangement of \\"White Christmas.\\" Sounded like a very good time was being had in the studio that day. \\"It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas\\" has a rep for being white-bread, but the Shearing-like tone of some of the piano work rescues it from that without making it self-consciously \\"hipster,\\" and Michael's phrasing does a good job of conveying his affection for the song. His work on \\"Holly Jolly Christmas\\" brooks no complaint; that's the singing of someone who reallyhas been wanting to do that since the first time he saw the Rudolph special when he was a little kid. \\"Silent Night\\" begins almost exactly the way Bing did it, but the arrangement here goes into territory that Crosby never explored, and Michael's and the children's choir's performance are exquisite. This really should have been the last track on the disc (AND they should have attributed Mohr/Gruber as the creators).   There are a few songs on here that are just okay, in that they have a \\"phoned-in\\" feel. While the arrangement of \\"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\\" is classic and workmanlike, Michael's part in it sounds like just anybody could have been in front of the mic for that recording. The best thing that can be said for \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is that he doesn't try to manipulate our emotions by including recordings of soldiers in Afghanistan saying \\"Merry Christmas\\" to their families. A classic example of singing the phone book (AND the Auto-Tuner strikes again, aarrgh). \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" is a really good reason to not let Phil Spector anywhere near a Christmas song in the first place, and Michael's version (have I mentioned that Auto-Tune is an abomination unto heaven yet?) doesn't do a thing to mitigate that. \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" is somewhat disappointing. Thank God for the block chords on the piano and the lush strings, but Michael phoned in his vocals again, and that just won't do.  On the whole, this would have been a better project if he had started with the \\"Let It Snow\\" EP and stretched that out to a full-length album. Michael and David (Foster), consider that your assignment for 2012. And please be clear that I'm saying all this because I think you have a good Christmas album in you.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This is well worth the money.  I was fulling expecting to spend $150-175 for the entire series and was so surprised and delighted to find it here on Amazon for $62.  It is a wonderful collection.  The outer box had some slight damage but the well packed cases were in excellent condition.  The two movies produced after Dr. Quinn ended are also in this collection so there is no need to purchase them separately.  Each episode has a written summary at the beginning so you can see what each episode is about.  I am totally thrilled with this collection and recommend it to all Dr Quinn fans!!!!

B000FC1AGG|5.0|which I almost never do. This is a fast, funny read. Having worked as a flight attendant I was so there on the plane with Emma, I could actually feel it lurch. The story grows as it continues thru the 'dead-end' unappreciated secretary (er, junior staff member) to the ups and downs of a budding relationship. Reading this book was like a memorable meal; delicious, filling and with a wonderful dessert at the end. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh.
0792846443|5.0|This is one of the best Stephen king adaptations (aside from Carrie and Christine and the shinning). Great suspense. One of my favorite things about the film is Cathie bates emotional down fall! There is only one more thing I would like to say,I don't think they should consider this a horror movie it's more of a thriller!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This app is my favorite app of all that I've seen. Elegant UI, packed with data but simple once you get it. It's like a game where you keep discovering features.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Amazing! Inspiring! Fearless! I've never seen anything like this before. It's totally spiritual and mystical. Superb selection of music.   Not for those who want to see more of what they've already seen, or a conventional narrative.  Bravo!  Btw, the story is a re-creation of Job's dilemma in a modern setting.

B005NS0VNU|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down to R.E.M., the foursome, then trio have been one of the most influential acts in alternative rock music. Their songs have been great standards of classic rock that still stand out today just like they did back in the 80's and 90's. But when word came out that R.E.M. was going to breakup after 30 years together, I just like many hard core R.E.M. fans was absolutely devistated. But there have been so many reflections of what has made The Rock And Roll Hall Of Famers so distinctive. That can be said with so many of their classic hits, but also with their later songs in the 2000 decade. Well, R.E.M. has parted ways, they have made one final imprint in a greatest hits record that appeals to all R.E.M. fans young and old.<br /><br />Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982-2011 is a strong reflection of what has made R.E.M. very dynamic and one of the biggest rock groups from college radio, to pop mainstream success in the 90's and beyond. The collection of songs handles mostly well for those new to what R.E.M. had musically from their classic I.R.S. days in the 80's, all the way to their final album, 2011's Collapse Into Now. The songs have all been remastered well, and include their biggest hits including Losing My Religion, It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine,) their classic The One I Love, as well as the somber Everybody Hurts. The collection also includes some new tracks from the group that were originally planned for Collapse Into Now like the intimate We All Go Back To Where We Belong and Hallejuah. The collection stands well, yet there were a few songs that were snubbed from the album including Daysleeper from 1998's Up, Bang And Blame from 1994's Monster, Radio Song from Out Of Time, and E-Bow The Letter from 1996's New Adventures In Hi-Fi. They could've been a part of the record, instead of lesser-known songs like Living Well Is The Best Revenge and New Test Leper that weren't hits from Michael Stipe, Bill Berry, Mike Mills and Peter Buck.<br /><br />Still, despite a few songs being overlooked, it is honestly very hard to believe that R.E.M. has broke up this year, and honestly there could be a reunion sometime down the road. But whatever the case is, they've made a imprint as one of the most influential rock acts of all time. Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982-2011 is a really striking reflection of why their songs have gone out to the ones they've loved. Hard core fans and newcomers will definitely flock to this collection, that is strong as losing their religion.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Remastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+el Stipe, Bill Berry, Mike Mills and Peter Buck.  Still, despite a few songs being overlooked, it is honestly very hard to believe that R.E.M. has broke up this year, and honestly there could be a reunion sometime down the road. But whatever the case is, they've made a imprint as one of the most influential rock acts of all time. Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982-2011 is a really striking reflection of why their songs have gone out to the ones they've loved. Hard core fans and newcomers will definitely flock to this collection, that is strong as losing their religion.  Album Cover: B  Songs: B  Price: B 1/2+  Remastering: B+  Overall: B 1/2+
B001POX73C|1.0|The historical category is my favorite type of romance, so I am in no way new to the jargon and terms used to portray their settings.  I enjoy picking up a few new terms and expanding my vocabulary when I read.  However, from the very beginning it felt like the author was going out of her way to throw in every obscure word and phrase she could come up with.  Instead of reading a smooth flowing story, I was struggling constantly to figure out what she was trying to relay.  Maybe the author was trying to stick with the true terminology of the period, but the archaic terms make the reading awkward and annoying.  In addition, I agree whole heartedly with the review by E.K. Irish, where she says she \\"didn't really see the romance between the hero and heroine ...... the hero was nice to her the whole time, helped her with her problems ....... Regardless, there was no mention of his blossoming affection for the heroine nor hers of him other than being surprised at his intelligence or kindness. No blushes, no racing hearts, nothing. So the romance part of this romance book really fell flat.\\"  Well put.  I couldn't have said that any better.  This was my first book by this author, and I won't be looking for her books in the future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchase many things off of Amazon and it seems like I only review the extraordinary items.  This book is extraordinary.  I read it non-stop for as long as it took to finish.  I was frustrated with the characters, just as the author wanted to me to be.  Each character is flawed, the antagonist is pure evil, the setting is harsh, the story is heart-wrenching.  I researched and discovered it will be a movie.  I really hope it does the book justice.  READ THE BOOK. If you are looking for an enchantingly horrible, disgustingly addicting story, go no further. I am half-way through the 3rd book in the trilogy and I still haven't been able to put the book down.
1439192812|4.0|I am a skeptic, atheist, rational humanist, etc. and I am thoroughly on board with Richard Dawkins.  Having said that, this book is clearly not meant for me.  I am currently somewhere in the middle and so far it has been business as usual.  He's preaching to the choir.  With the exception of some fascinating tidbits of etymology, I already know everything he is telling me.<br /><br />\\"The Magic of Reality\\" is clearly aimed at the ignorant masses... and some say, even children (which is fantastic).  This is a bold move by Dawkins.  It shows that he is willing to accept the inevitable attack as the masses fret about the loss of their magic and deities.  Most skeptical writers write to a skeptical audience, thus avoiding the ire of millions who avoid reading difficult books.<br /><br />This is a simple book.  It leads the reader gently by the hand through rudimentary, foundational science that is absolutely vital in understanding how the world really works.  For someone well versed in the subject, and science in general, there are no jaw-dropping eye openers, no amazing connections are revealed.  And that's fine. I am happy to not really enjoy this book if it serves to open the eyes of countless others.
0765365278|1.0|This book shares the two great flaws of Sanderson's Mistborn series.  It suffers from a strict and regulated magic system that initially appeals for its consistency and then bores with its utter mechanistic nature.  It's interesting to note that both magic systems rely upon a kind of fuel-- metals in the case of the Mistborn series, and energy-infused crystals in this one.  I know some people like these well-though out systems.  I find them boring after too long.  The second flaw is a reliance upon strict social hierarchies.  I know masters and servants, lords and paupers, etc are common fare in fantasy novels, but Sanderson doesn't know how to handle them.  This is a serious drawback for me since he creates his worlds from the ground up often, but just imports a simplistic template of aristocrats and commoners.  Really, if you're going to create an entire new world, then please get more creative with the issue of class.  The social division between those born with light eyes and those born with dark was just silly.  On a related note, this book deals with two slave classes, a docile race of servants and a more traditional slave class.  Both Mistborn and this book depends so much upon sympathy for the underclasses, but his approach to class is really ham-handed in my opinion.  As I see it, all of these problems are symptomatic of world-building for the sake of world-building.    Ok, one last point.  There is so much warfare in this novel, and yet I was never really invested in the war itself.  It was as if the world was so developed that it eclipsed the human elements of the book.  Politics, race relations and gender relations, religion, etc were squashed by the weight of his world.  It's no wonder that the human element often gets developed in flashbacks.  I know he has a huge fan base and folks will continue to give this novel 4-5 stars, but I felt compelled to write a negative review for those readers who, like me, read through the entire book and felt utterly shocked by how tedious it is.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|If you want the thinnest, lowest profile case for the Kindle Fire (at least for now) then this is your case.  It's not going to win any awards for design or quality.  It won't save it from anything except a shallow fall onto like a carpet floor or a pillow.  But it does at a negligible amount of weight and size to the Fire.  It is rubberized so it provides a secure grip.  And it does provide a means of standing up the Fire, if a slightly unstable one.  I'm hoping the cover sort of gets \\"broken in\\" to where it'll start to have somewhat of a memory where the folding occurs the most and provide a more stable stand.  I pre-ordered this one because I didn't want any \\"fingers\\" or straps gripping the device to hold it in the case.  And out of the initial cases available, this was the only one that offered that.  I was sort of hoping this would have a build and feel to it similar to the magnetic cover for the IPad 2 that Apple came out with, but this is a far cry from that.  It does feel chintzy, low quality. I guess we'll see how it fares in the long term.  I'm glad they dropped the price $10.00 already, it should really be a $10 or at most $15.00 case.  So you're still paying a premium.  Unless you have to have the lowest profile case, I would look elsewhere.

B004HO6I2E|1.0|Not what I saw on the previews.  Thought it would be a cute comedy.......instead it's the F word in EVERY single sentence and sometimes two or three times.  I think the goal was to see how many times they could say it in one movie.  Got to the scene that was pretty much pornographic and turned it off, that was about ten minutes into the movie.  What a waste of money and two actors that I've always enjoyed.  Sad that they resorted to this.  In their defense, I should have looked up the rating of the movie and why.
B0045HCJQW|3.0|While it is hard to beat Carey Grant and Katherine Hepburn I personally liked High Society better. This is an earlier version of High Society and I found this version a little preachy and it carries on too much about wealth and money and lacks a certain quality which High Society certainly has got. I suggest pruchasing High Society rather than this movie. If you want to get a good movie with these two together I would suggest \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" which is a funny and delightful movie which is hard to beat for good entertainment.
0439023521|5.0|Right away this book captures my attention with a quick introduction to Katniss's survival skills followed by the District 12 Hunger Games lottery, a grim holiday that nobody wants to celebrate, but is still mandatory. It does not take long for the reader to feel sympathetic towards Katniss and the hardship she struggles with everyday just to survive.<br />Every detail leading up to the actual event of the Hunger Games has a surreal feel, as Katniss is primped and paraded like a beauty pageant contestant, as if everyone is ignoring the fact that these are children, with all but one facing imminent death. This is reality television meets the ancient gladiator games of Rome, combined with the sick irony of using a nation's most precious commodity -- its children. As a mother of three, I can not even fathom living in a country that tolerated this year after year. These Hunger Games are the country's way of preventing rebellion in its citizens through fear, brainwashing, and desensitization, as it is mandatory for every citizen to watch. In some districts, this is so successful that children are routinely trained specifically for the Hunger Games, volunteering to face murder and death for a chance at fame and fortune.<br />The love triangle is obvious early on, though the conflict can't come into play until the second book in the series. Peeta is the one in the spotlight, the one that humanizes Katniss for the viewers and makes her likable due to his own romantic feelings for her. Unfortunately, Katniss is too busy staying alive to be certain of her true feelings, even though she can pretend well enough to convince even Peeta. Peeta is self-sacrificing, while Katniss is observant and resourceful. Katniss is able to avoid becoming a cold-hearted murderer only because of Peeta's presence.<br />Regarding the actual Game, those that run it operate to keep the entertainment value up, adding to the danger of the contestants still alive, handing out gifts to give one an edge over another, forcing contestants into battle to increase bloodshed and drama, and generally treating the twenty-four as actors and actresses in any other fictional television drama. What Katniss keeps returning to is how \\"normal\\" these people of the Capitol see of the deaths of these children. It occurred to me while reading this that it would be better to be one of those that died in the Games, rather than live with being the monster responsible for the deaths of twenty-three other children purely for the entertainment of the shallow and self-absorbed.<br />This book is both shocking and heart-rending, and I look forward to the next installment, Catching Fire.forcing contestants into battle to increase bloodshed and drama, and generally treating the twenty-four as actors and actresses in any other fictional television drama.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ernest Cline was born in 1972 in Ashland Ohio and is best known in the Austin Poetry Slam venues. In 2001 Cline self published a chapbook collection of his spoken work writing \\"The importance of Being Ernest\\". Cline also has some early attempts at writing screen plays; \\"Fanboys\\" generated local interest in Austin Texas. In June of 2010 Cline sold his first novel, \\"Ready Player One\\" in a bidding war of publishers (Random House winning) and the film rights to Warner Brothers with Cline slated to write the screen play.  In the realm of novel publishing 95% of all novels will rate average. The average bar is high because there are a lot of good writers. Of the total, 2% will be above average and 2% below average. The remaining 1% will be exceptional. Earnest Cline's \\"Ready Player One\\" makes it to the 1% club. When you have publishers fighting over your work, there's a reason!   This novel is in the science fiction/fantasy category with extensions of mystery and a love story.  \\"Ready Player One\\" has it all. The story line is compelling; the good guys against the bad guys; good versus evil. The Theme is captivating; a quest for a prize in a fictional reality created by a pop culture icon who wants his fantasy achievement to transcend his death. The plot is superb; a deadly game, played by enterprising young adults both in and out of reality, pitted against their adult rivals. The prize, an enormous amount of wealth tied to the moral implications of its use - freedom or enslavement. The characters are terrific. You have some to love and some to hate. The young adults, the teenagers, the good guys are the equivalent of the pop culture they revel in; they represent creative intelligence, fierce friendships born of their quest and Shakespearean love - a version of love absent the sexual depravity so often substituted for it. Who are the villains? Why IOI, Innovative Online Industries a global communications conglomerate and the world's largest Internet service provider; a parody perhaps?  Cline goes easy on the future political landscape, not preaching to us but showing in small clips what our real world may devolve into; a place emaciated from misuse of resources, particularly energy; a place where escape from reality is a means of survival; of an oppressive environment where the poor are still enslaved by drugs and uselessness. Cline also makes a parody of the present bank credit card environment. He creates the federal law of mandatory indenturement for those classified as impecunious and for failing to pay their Visa card bill.  Credit Default Indenturement was designed so that \\"Indents\\" were never able to pay off their debt and earn release: \\"Once they got finished slapping you with pay deductions, late fees, and interest penalties, you wound up owing more each month, instead of less. Once you made the mistake of getting yourself indentured, you would probably remain indentured for life\\".   About the pop culture of the 1980's around which the novel is centered; you really don't need to know about it personally. If you happened to live through the era and can relate to the references, great! If not it really makes no difference. I will say though, it was a great era.  In the manner that Cline writes, the fantasy is the pop culture itself, primarily video games. Cline explains each reference he uses to advance the plot so it could just as well substitute for some fictional creation.  For those who would look for errors and omissions here; forget it! It doesn't matter. If you ever played Pac Man or its equivalent, or listened to any 80's music, you are experienced enough and know all you need to know about the pop culture of the 80's. The substance of the cult and Cline's point was really the genius of the young people who advanced the technical fields of science and technology with games and music; something that would never be recreated again and not in 2041.  Is there anything negative to say? Not much, but if there were something,I would tend to say I would have been happier if the composition was a little shorter.  By the time I reached level II, I was afraid the novel was going to collapse under its own weight - it didn't. Cline managed to introduce some new elements into the plot that kept it going, but it was close.  All and all I highly recommend this novel. In my ratings I would make this one \\"Memorable\\".
B0046ECFRM|5.0|The review:<br /><br />Oh mon Dieu!! Where was this book all this time?? I chose this book to be my first contemporary read and my break from Vampire novels, and thank God I chose it! It's simply so great :).<br /><br />Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down at all!! I had to finish it and I feel sad that there's no sequel :'). This book is forty-seven chapters of goodness. The main reason for me loving Anna and the French Kiss is the way Stephanie wrote it, it was fun to read with 80% of funny moments between friends and normal situations.<br /><br />I don't have a favorite character, I love them all!!! Except for Toph.... Anna was a typical girl and it was nice to read about a girl who acted like any other average girl her age :). As for Etienne St. Claire, no need to comment on him!!!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This book is a recommended read for any YA/Contemporary novel fans who like a lot of laughter and normal situations with a great writing style.
B005R2S04E|5.0|CAN (formed in Germany in the late 60's) was a fierce combination of rock (not r 'n' r), jazz, electronics, and with Damo Suzuki's vocals (used at times like another instrument), was one of the better bands playing something akin to Prog-Rock during the hey-day of that style.  And when the band added their deep, aggressive, almost funk-like rhythms into the music, they produced an oftentimes visceral sound that was very compelling.  They have been compared to the VELVET  UNDERGROUND, but that's a bit of a misnomer.  On extended tracks both groups had a (sometimes) similar sound.  But when CAN added that snaky, dark, organic rhythmic feel, they were in a space of their own making.  CAN were ultimately more aggressive in their playing than the V.U.  They approach music differently-they begin playing and let the music take control-until they stop.  Their music isn't as simplistic as the above sentence might lead you to believe-rather it's full of  smaller, subtle (varied and various) influences that are woven into, and combined into a fierce overall approach-and it works.<br /><br />CAN was never all that well known, which is a shame.  The band released several albums of well written, arranged, and exciting music-music that still has much of it's power intact today.  But their music wasn't all that easy to understand, they were sometimes labeled as an avant-garde group, and that didn't equate into record sales.  Even on the underground scene of the period, the band was not that well known or appreciated.  They were perceived as \\"far out\\"-and in a sense, they were-but in a good, individualistic way.  Besides \\"Tago Mago\\", they released other fine albums like \\"Ege Bamyasi\\", and \\"Future Days\\" among others.  One of the tracks on the extra disc in this edition, \\"Spoon\\", was originally released on \\"Ege Bamyasi\\"-although the studio version was a bit over three minutes long.  Here, the band stretches the composition out to approximately thirty minutes, where they really explore the arrangement to good effect.<br /><br />The band (for those who don't know) consisted of Holger Czukay on earth rumbling bass.  Jackie Liebezeit-an extraordinary drummer capable of both pushing the band along in a groove, and playing with great finesse.  Irmin Schmidt-a keyboard player who could play most any style, and used his talents to color the band's sound, and  who could also play with great restraint when called for-with great beauty.  Michael Karoli-a guitarist who could up the firepower when called for and who could also play with great restraint.  And when you add Suzuki's sometimes \\"doomy\\" vocal style into the mix, you have a group of immense talent and power.<br /><br />And that brings us to \\"Tago Mago\\", one of the better (some say best) albums CAN ever released.  THERE'S AN IMPORT EDITION WHICH IS IDENTICAL TO THIS RELEASE-BUT COSTS APPROXIMATELY TWICE AS MUCH-SO BEWARE.  The sound is very good, having been remastered from the original stereo master tapes-under the watchfulness of both Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, in Germany.  This re-issue has the original packaging not seen since the original release-a nice touch-and it befits the band.  The 14 page booklet is a good combination of essay and photographs.  Included is a two page piece from the magazine Melody Maker from 1972.  This concise article was used as the liner notes for the album's original release the same year.  There's also an appreciation from Bobby Gillespie (PRIMAL SCREAM) on how the band influenced him.  There are another two pieces on CAN and their music from Duncan Stubbs and Duncan Fallowell, which shed more light on the band. The discs slip inside separate sleeves that slip inside a wallet style holder.  This, plus the booklet, fit inside a fold-apart holder.  The colorful graphics that cover all the above really bring back the feel of that period of music, and a time when record labels/art directors were allowed to do just about anything.  Over time this style of outsideholder will tear or become damaged with use-but it sure looks cool!<br /><br />  The shorter tracks (Disc 1 is approximately 73 minutes long) have an interest all their own (hear \\"Paperhouse\\", \\"Mushroom\\", or \\"Oh Yeah\\"-which begins with, literally, an explosion), but it's when the band allows themselves room to fully explore the music, that the group is heard at their best.  Compositions like \\"Halleluhwah\\" (likened to Miles Davis' \\"Bitches Brew\\" jam era of  tape editing tune construction, here also in a shorter 9 minute live version), \\"Peking O\\", and \\"Aumgn\\" are fine examples of the band at their best.  The playing is intelligent yet exciting, taught and never flabby, and gives the band the chance to do what they do best-incorporate their various (and varied) influences into the music.  And having an additional disc of live tracks (approximately 48 minutes worth) only emphasizes the band's sound.  This is sometimes dense, rhythmically intense music that has a real edge to it-in part due to Suzuki's speaking/sung vocals and the band's use of droning sound (that's where the avant-garde label comes in), that in combination produces some exhilarating music that sets this band apart from other groups plying the Prog-Rock landscape.  Listen to the live tracks (\\"Spoon\\", \\"Halleluwah\\") for prime examples of their rhythmically dense, subtly droning intense style of playing.<br /><br />This is collective, in-your-face, doom-laden, funky, nowhere-to-hide, space, trance music that comes from some other place-sounding like some kind of organic machine.  It's music played by five people-but they seem to coalesce into some sort of powerful, singular group mind.  This is music that needs to be heard all the way through at one sitting.  To not do so, is to sharply lessen the impact and the effect it has on the whole listening experience.  The scope of this music is broad and deep-it grabs a hold of both your mind and body until you find yourself a part of the collective experience  that is \\"Tago Mago\\"/CAN.<br /><br />It's still a mystery why CAN was never more well known and accepted during the late 60's/early 70's.  This was a period when musical boundaries were in constant flux and change. While other bands grabbed all the attention, CAN continued to play and release several fine albums-all to little or no fanfare.  Perhaps it's because they hailed from Germany-while most (if not all) the well known groups were anchored in Britain, and to some extent America.  Yes, their music has to be heard and not just listened to-you have to pay attention, but the rewards are very satisfying.  The vocals weren't for everyone.  And the \\"avant-garde\\" tag didn't help either.  But no matter-CAN still rank as one of the finest groups of their era.  And the rewards found in their music makes all the effort worthwhile.  Open your ears, and you too might find some very fine music from a perennially unknown, yet cutting edge band.  Hopefully the band's other fine albums will be re-issued in a format like \\"Tago Mago\\".  Maybe they'll get the rewards they deserve after all.aged with use-but it sure looks cool!

B005KXV8XK|4.0|The years 1969-1970 were ones of much change for DEEP PURPLE.  Beginning as a rock/prog rock/singles band in the late 60's, the band morphed into a more straight ahead hard rock band by 1970.  The band's first vocalist, Rod Evans didn't suit the change in sound that other members of the band were beginning to play-so Ian Gillan-in.  The band's original bass player, Nick Simper (who co-wrote \\"Wring That Neck\\" a scorching instrumental), was likewise let go.  In came Roger Glover.  As always, Blackmore's  lightening guitar, Paice's full drumming, and Lord's bluesy, sometimes show-off Hammomd organ style are all over these tracks.  All to good effect.  The remastered sound is not always up to snuff-it varies from track to track, but the chance to hear this early music takes precedence-at least for me, and the sound does improve as you listen through both discs.  So you've been warned.  There's also a disclaimer about the sound to that effect.  The informative (10 page) booklet contains both session by session, and background information on the music on this set, along with a few photographs of the band(s).  There's also a couple of short interviews with both Rod Evans and Jon Lord.  There's also the odd cut-off/fadeout on some tracks.<br /><br />This set is a good comparison of the band's change in sound.  The first disc (about 50 minutes in length with some music before their debut single \\"Hush\\" was released) has the original band working out on then current tunes \\"Hush\\", \\"Hey Joe\\", \\"Help!\\" (a good version of this band favorite), and other tracks.  A few highlights-a tough version of \\"Wring That Neck\\" (titled \\"Hard Road in the U.S. because the original title sounded to \\"violent\\"), \\"It's All Over\\"-a good example of the band's hard-pop sound, likewise \\"The Painter\\" (vsn one), \\"I'm So Glad\\"-identified with CREAM-but given the DEEP PURPLE treatment, with most of these tracks from from their first releases.  While I do believe that Evans' smoother, more relaxed (and limited) vocal style didn't always fit in with the band's sound, I still have a distinct soft spot for the albums he recorded with the band.  And Simper, never a fantastic bass player, was never less than competent, and sometimes his sound fit the band's sound perfectly.  Plus he could write a good tune now and then.  And here I must confess that I still play the band's first three albums (partly because of nostalgia I still own the original U.S. vinyl releases), and still hear a lot of good, early prog-rock/rock (as opposed to r'n'r) that still sounds great.  The radio \\"hits\\" and other singles the band released during this era were great examples of British music of the period.  Of interest is the double CD of the band's Singles and E.P.'s from 1968-80, which lays out the band's changing style-something close to an aural biography of DEEP PURPLE in those years.<br /><br />The second disc (about 48 minutes in length), with Gillan and Glover, has a more defined rock sound-they have in some ways \\"refined\\" their sound (gone are the more pop leanings), and distilled it down to what they do best.  With Evans gone, Gillan's more strident vocal approach has upped the ante in the rock-band department.  An early version of \\"Speed King\\" (titled \\"Ricochet\\") is unique because of it's unrefined arrangement-they're not quite there yet, as the well known album version attests.  \\"Speed King\\" is another tough rocking version of that tune.  \\"Jam Stew\\" is another full throttle 4/4 track, showing the band all-out rocking.  \\"Grabsplatter\\" (later recorded with vocals as \\"I'm Alone\\")-another great, tough instrumental.  And  one song that a lot of DEEP PURPLE fans rate highly, \\"Child In Time\\", is easily the equal in this live recording, to  the studio recording from the album \\"In Rock\\".  If you already own the massive CD box set \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\" (now sadly deleted), you already own most of disc two's tracks.  If you don't, then this collection of tunes will partly prove what a great hardrock band DEEP PURPLE was becoming.<br /><br />If you own any of the several collections (bootleg or otherwise) of this period of DEEP PURPLE live on stage or on the BBC, you have a good idea of what to expect.  If not, this set will, perhaps, open your eyes to just how good the original band was, and how good they sounded just after Gillan and Glover joined the band.  This set is a good reminder of what British pop/prog-rock/rock sounded like in the early days when music was in constant flux.  It's a good chance to hear one of the best British bands in it's original incarnation-and there's not a lot out there with Evans and Simper-so this set is even more valuable.  And Gillan's vocals amp up the band's sound even more.  Plus, it's just some great music-this set is near the top of the heap of early DEEP PURPLE releases.<br /><br /> This set can sit alongside other live releases from that period, when DEEP PURPLE  was a truly exciting band.  Hearing this music brings back all the palpable excitement, the newness, the thrill of music during this era.  I still remember hearing \\"Hard Road\\", shredding my car radio speaker-and wondering-\\"Who was that?!\\"  The early sound and feel of the band runs all through these tracks-before they went on to massive fame and fortune.  Their early sound had an edge to it that sounded honest, visceral-and straight out rocked-without the baggage that came later with being \\"superstars\\". Just about any track will prove that.E was becoming.  If you own any of the several collections (bootleg or otherwise) of this period of DEEP PURPLE live on stage or on the BBC, you have a good idea of what to expect.  If not, this set will, perhaps, open your eyes to just how good the original band was, and how good they sounded just after Gillan and Glover joined the band.  This set is a good reminder of what British pop/prog-rock/rock sounded like in the early days when music was in constant flux.  It's a good chance to hear one of the best British bands in it's original incarnation-and there's not a lot out there with Evans and Simper-so this set is even more valuable.  And Gillan's vocals amp up the band's sound even more.  Plus, it's just some great music-this set is near the top of the heap of early DEEP PURPLE releases.

B005KDWUFA|3.0|IL DIVO is FABULOUS--love the guys and their voices are lovely, however, the choice of songs is not to my particular taste. Also 10 songs for what the guys have said is their \\"BEST WORK YET.\\" I hate to disagree, but their other CDs were far better both in the number of songs and the choice of songs. I will always love IL DIVO, but not too fond of this particular CD.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Thor has to get a good review, for the simple fact that it didn't end up being outrageously goofy.  It was thoughtful, had good character development, and Hemsworth did a great job as the son of Odin.  I'd say this is the second best lead-in movie for the Avengers film in 2012 (right behind the first Iron Man).  The only major problem with the movie is the fight scene between Thor and the Destroyer--it's way too short.  Marvel also did this with the main fight scene at the end of Iron Man 2.  Are they just too tired at the end of production to make the fight scenes more elaborate and compelling?  It's strange that they make such an expensive movie and then skimp on a major battle.
B00422LESO|5.0|A clever mix of escapist fan fiction and a modern re-telling of Jane Austen.  When I found out that Stephenie Meyer was making this book into a movie, I HAD to read it.  My first thoughts were that (1) there is no conflict in this novel and (2) that this novel is purely escapist. As I went on though, the main character, Jane, became more and more relatable and I changed my mind about the purely escapist idea. It had more depth to it than I thought it would and oh, how I felt for poor Jane as the story went on. Shannon Hale talks a lot about the Regency period, explaining the why and how of the social customs of the time. I learned a lot and it was delightful not to mention helpful in understanding Jane Austen a little better. The whole book was charming, witty and fun. I was blown away at how creative the whole thing was.  I've never read anything like it.  A must-read for Jane Austen fans and even chick-lit fans.
B004EPZ084|4.0|I thought it was hysterical in the theater, so I bought it from Amazon when it came out.  Sorry to say that it was not as funny the second time, although I still enjoyed it.  I'll probably have to wait a few years to watch it again.  It does have a lot of explicitly sexual language and images, which turns some people off.

1451648537|1.0|The fact is, this book is nothing more than an overlong, poorly researched, magazine article.  Isaacson blew it, big time.    The book is a collection of misquoted stories and half truths presented as \\"facts.\\"  He spends the book quoting Jobs, then cross examining him with the quotes of others, often missing the salient issues as hand.  Too many of the quotes he relays are misquotes, since they were often drawn from past blogs and articles which give a full and proper context.  His technical knowledge is weak and often faulty, which leads me to suspect the veracity of the rest of the book.  But the worse part is, the book has no soul and doesn't really reveal much new about Steve Jobs.    I read an obit in the New York Times by Steve Jobs' sister Mona Simpson that was moving and shined a light on Steve Jobs.  This is book is cold and poorly researched.  I would love to see Mona write another bio for Steve Jobs.  He deserves it.  A huge missed opportunity.

B005D9B26E|4.0|I love this album. It connects somehow, the frustration of My g-g-g-generation extended to an entire double album, played with the frenetic energy and genius of The Who, and intermingled with a dash of Pete Townshend's mystical leanings. I am the sea.   It is not only the music, the whole package was perfect when it arrived in autumn 1973. The black and white cover with the scooter and the four faces of the band reflected in its mirrors, and a breathtakingly good series of monochrome photographs. If any record deserves a deluxe edition, this one does.  And here it is - or is it? What we have is something half-way between the sumptuous, informative, historic collector's edition which the album merits, and the kind of money grabbing release you get when some record company notices how much people are paying for boxed sets these days and says, \\"Quick, let's get Quadrophenia out before the CD market disappears completely\\".  Because there is a lot wrong with this release, though I still cannot give it less than four stars. Still, time to stop rambling and tell you what you get. Within a very solid slipcase you will find a poster advertising the original double album (actually this is a fine reproduction and one of the better things here), a colour envelope holding various bits of memorabilia: reproductions of some of Townshend's draft lyrics, a rather darkly reproduced colour photo of Jimmy (the central character) on a scooter, and a 7-inch single of 5.15 backed with the slightly rare track Water.  Then there is the main event: a 100-page hardback book of photos and an essay by Townshend, within which nestle the original double CD remastered, a DVD with 8 tracks remixed for 5.1 surround sound, and two CDs of Townshend's demos for the album.  The book is certainly nice to have, though bear in mind that the original album came with a 46 page insert which is all included in the book, so that accounts for nearly a quarter of it. I am also upset to report that the quality ofthose wonderful photographs is poor; I was really hoping that I would get better copies than those in my falling-apart LP but in fact these are noticeably worse; they have that grainy look you get when photos are reprinted from a print rather than from the originals.  Still, the *other* photos in the book are nicely reproduced and the essay is fascinating if you love Quadrophenia half as much as I do. Townshend recounts how he came up with the story that is printed in the front cover of the LP (and also here), when remembering how he slept under Brighton pier once \\"after a riotous night at the Aquarium ballroom.\\" He also describes how the album came together, how it was recorded, and adds notes on the songs and demos.  If you are a fan, you will definitely want to hear the demos too. They form a sort-of alternate version of the album, lacking the Who's energy but with its own appeal. There are also songs here that are not on the album, and others that did not show up until the soundtrack of the Quadrophenia film. Some of the songs have overdubs which I personally would rather had been omitted.  Note that the standard-price 2CD set has 11 of the demos as bonus tracks. This box has 25 demo tracks.  The 5.1 mix is enjoyable too. This album is ideal for surround sound, especially at those moments when sea noises swirl around.   It's curious though that only 8 tracks have been mixed to 5.1. Why? But the rest of 5.1 Quadrophenia is not the only thing missing.   The important thing to realise is that this is Townshend's deluxe box, rather than The Who's deluxe box. I have not spotted any contribution to the package from Roger Daltrey, despite his massive contribution to the quality of the album, nor even any attempt to collect existing quotes from the two members of the band who are no longer with us, Keith Moon and John Entwistle. There are no outtakes from band sessions, nor are there any live tracks from when Quadrophenia was performed live back in the day; yes I realise that the concerts at the time had some problems but I would still love to hear how they sounded.  Quadrophenia was remixed in 1996 and it is the remix that is offered here (there are small differences in the remaster including a new train noise in 5.15 but no big leap in sound quality), but for completeness I would have liked both mixes to be included, in line with what has been done in deluxe boxes for other classic albums such as Jethro Tull's Aqualung and King Crimson's In the Court of. To my mind the original mix is still important, the Quadrophenia that is as I first heard it in the seventies.  So this is a frustrating production, much less than it should be; but then again frustration is what Quadrophenia is all about so that is curiously fitting. Fans will still want this package, hard though it is to justify the cost. And I suppose when and if the full 5.1 release is done eventually we will be asked to pay again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I am a huge gamer and I use this for Call of duty 4, Call of duty Black Ops, and Call of Duty MW3 they all support 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound! The bass will melt your brain and the Microphone is awesome very sensitive. One thing they leave out is the microphone is actually adjustable closer to your mouth or farther away. The voice changer is a nice touch also! Would recommend this to a friend without hesitation!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I just discovered this series this year, and as a huge fan of Tolkien & LeGuin, I can wholeheartedly give these books a huge thumbs' up!!  George R.R. Martin has a unique take on the genre.  The story does require your attention... it's not a quick read, but the payoff is terrific.  Startling plot twists, totally unique characters.  WOW!!  Also... the HBO mini-series is an amazingly good adaptation, so check it out!
1582882339|3.0|I didn't realize that the story \\"I am Legend\\" actually only takes up about the first 150 pages of this book.  I was, therefore, quite surprised when I turned the page, thinking I'd simply come to the end of the chapter, and found instead a bunch of short stories.  It just didn't feel like it should be the end.  I didn't expect the main character to give up so easily, after everything he went through up until that point.<br /><br />But it was dark, and I quite liked that.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, overall the book wasn't that great.  I found it very slow and difficult to begin with.  It got a bit more interesting when there was some actual dialogue (even if it was just with a dog) but that didn't last long...<br /><br />I found sometimes the narrative a bit confusing.  Seemed a lot of sub-plots were dropped and never mentioned again.  Sometimes the use of flashbacks confused me, because it wasn't quite clear that they were flashbacks.<br /><br />The main character wasn't really all that likeable or interesting, but at least I did feel that I could sympathize with him somewhat.<br /><br />The book didn't have the atmosphere of the movie; in fact, it didn't really have all that much atmosphere at all, never mind the movie!<br /><br />I wanted to like it a lot more than I did.  I was surprised when I reached the end, because I was thinking something finally interesting had happened and maybe the plot would pick up a bit from then on.  Instead, it's just THE END and a bunch of short stories!<br /><br />I haven't read all of the short stories yet.  I read the first two.  I thought the first one was a bit boring and pointless.  I kinda liked the second because of the dark implication at the end of it.  The third, I am reading at the moment, seems okay.  But nothing so far has been particularly special.  But, it adds a bit of value to a book that would otherwise have seemed very high price for only 150 pages of story, so I guess I won't complain too much at that.<br /><br />This is a book that's worth reading if you're a fan of the movie, just so you can compare.  I liked the movie more, which is quite unusual for me - typically I prefer the books.st so you can compare.  I liked the movie more, which is quite unusual for me - typically I prefer the books.

B0057AOS3I|5.0|Where do I begin, This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. She has received a lot of flack for this album, but I have to disagree with the bad reviews. This is a break down of each track  1+1: The album starts with a beautiful ballad, which showcases Beyonce's amazing voice. A true love song, that should get her a Grammy, for her vocal performance  I Care: A hard hitting ballad, that also shows her range, with her hard vocal and hard production.  I Miss You: One of my favorites, the song is so settle and relaxing. The lyrics are even more beautiful. I would definitely say its different from what we are used to from her, but its a stand out track on the album.  Best Thing I Never Had: Once again AMAZING VOCAL,also a good sing along. Reminds me a lot of Irreplaceable. Grammy Nomination worthy  Party: Another stand out track, Kanye did an excellent job with the production. A true party anthem.. Andre 3000 did a great verse that completed the track  Rather Die Young: She should have just called it Dear Jay. I love it! A well written song, and reminds me of a genre, I can not really pen point.   Start Over: I think this should have been a single. It has radio appeal, and probably the most commercial song on the album, but its one of my favorites. From her vocal, to the production, to the lyrics. I absolutely love this song  Love On Top: Classic, old school track. Best Traditional R&B Performance Grammy WIN! Another stand out track.  Countdown: Boyyyyyyyyyyy! Another great track! This is probably one of the funner tracks, I can only think I would be better with a rap verse  End of Time: Great Upbeat Song! Nothing really to say about it but she should release it as a single  I Was Here: A Legends song! This song shows Beyonce's amazing vocals once again. I can see it being in commercials, and her performing it at A Legends Ball!  Run the World (Girls): This song was not a good first single choice to me, but its a great dance track, and the video is to die for!  Deluxe Edition:  Lay Up Under Me: Why only on the deluxe?!!!! I love this track, I can see the video in my mind, and I hear it blasting through the speakers of many women.   Schoolin' Life: Reminds me of Prince. Amazing track, with amazing concept, all around an amazing song, except the ending didn't make sense to me.    Dance for You: Grab your man and do a lap dance song. Probably the most R&B song on the album. Favorite!
1451648537|5.0|I just finished Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs this past weekend.  Wow. What an amazing life.  Beyond all of the great innovations that sparked out of the mind of Steve Jobs like Apple, Pixar, Disney, etc., I was genuinely moved by his personal story and the flurry of insights into life and business it stirred within me.  Here are some of the key thoughts I walked away with from reading the book:  No one is perfect so stop acting like it. Steve Jobs clearly recognized that he had issues (and lots of them!). He knew that many people didn't like his approach or tact in leading companies and ideas. Jobs often ignored or pushed back any thoughts that went contrary to his own convictions. Nevertheless, he stayed relatively true to who he was. He understood that he was a flawed being trying to live out something he believed to be right.      Do what you love and love what you do. Steve Jobs didn't do what he did because of money. He actually loved his job (no pun intended). He had a genuine passion to do what he thought would make him feel completely alive. In fact, Jobs gave up several opportunities for more money so that he could focus on creating products the he way he wanted. He had the rare privilege of waking up each morning to do what he loved.      Live without regret. Steve Jobs went for it! Period. He couldn't bear the thought of not trying something be believed to be right. Did Jobs have any regrets? Of course he did. Nevertheless, Jobs wanted to go to the grave with no gas left in his tank. By in large, he did just that.      Speak your mind and live with the consequences. Steve Jobs did not shy away from confrontation. Although many (if not most) didn't appreciate it, it did bring clarity to a lot of important relationships throughout Jobs' life. As difficult as it was to hear, people knew where they stood with Jobs. I think there's a raw beauty here that could be learned by many of us leading companies and organizations.      Learn from the unexpected and unrelated. Steve Jobs was a continual learner. He was not shy about engaging fields unrelated to technology. Jobs understood that creativity is often birthed when two seemingly unrelated ideas collide with one another. He masterful integration of technology and the arts is a testament to this paradigm.      Simplicity must be integrated. Steve Jobs worked towards simplicity in all of his product development. Nevertheless, he didn't just end with simplicity, but rather, sought simplicity that could be integrated to the whole of his company. In other words, simplicity in of itself was not good enough. A specific creation had to find its place in the collective whole.  Steve Jobs was far from being perfect. I think his relationship to loved ones and people who genuinely cared about his work was less than admirable. Maybe this is why I like him. I like the fact that Jobs was human...an average guy with an extraordinary gift. He did what he could with what he had and changed the world in the process.  I thank Steve Jobs for being Steve Jobs. Imperfect Brilliance.
B00007LTIC|5.0|I had not remembered how great this disc is until replacing my vinyl copy with the cd version.  The sound of the remaster really brings this collection of songs back into life, as one of the classic yet largely not played (on the radio)  YES albums.  Even if you are unfamiliar with the songs on this disc, don't hesitate to add it to your personal music library.  You will be happy that you did!
6304698623|5.0|I remember I was around 10 when I watched this with my family. We picked it out by chance, but honestly, it made every cell of my body weep. I was still learning English and my classmates were sometimes harsh on me. A movie can be so magical that you can dwell into the atmosphere of the characters and the scenario. This movie built my confidence, expanded my imagination as a child, and influenced me to believe in my dreams. This is the kind of movie that I will never forget, I gasped when i saw it here on amazon. I do not believe it is jus t a kids movie. Now that it's here, i'm buying it and everyone's gonna see it, even my 20 year friends in college.

B000FVQLQQ|5.0|OK, to start with, this film won Academy awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director (Ron Howard), Best Picture (2002), and Best Supporting Actress (Jennifer Connelly), and Crowe was nominated for Best Actor.  Need I say more?  No, but I will...<br /><br />In this film Crowe portrays the brilliant, but mentally unstable and asocial mathematician John Nash during his years in graduate school and throughout his professional career.  He becomes obsessed with patterns and cryptography, and he is hired to work for the government on a top secret assignment to locate a nuclear weapon that is allegedly being brought into the USA to be detonated by the USSR during the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />Crowe does an AMAZING job portraying Nash, and Connelly is fantastic as his intelligent and long-suffering wife.<br /><br />If you like top-quality drama, intelligent movies, and unexpected twists and turns then you will eat this film up!  After a while even you as a viewer will be wondering what is real and what is part of Nash's imaginary world.<br /><br />5 solid stars.  Kudos to everyone involved.

B001FB55MG|4.0|As you probably know, Adam Sandler has a tendency to make pretty darned funny movies, e.g., [[ASIN:B0009X760U Happy Gilmore (Widescreen Special Edition)]], but they are often too edgy or crass to be considered family viewing fare.  Bedtime Stories, however, is a watchable film.  It is still a bit edgy, but not so much so that you couldn't watch it.<br /><br />Sandler plays a character who grew up in a motel owned and operated by his father.  He thinks it is the most wonderful place in the entire world.  His sister, on the other hand, is a complete pragmatist, apparently with little imagination.  Fast forward to today, and Sandler is working as a maintenance man in a mega-hotel where his father's motel used to stand.  About this time Sandler's sister needs to leave town and she needs Sandler to watch her two children.<br /><br />There are some laugh-out-loud scenes when he meets the kids.  He discovers that his sister is  extremely socially conscious and does not allow her children to watch TV or eat any junk food at all.  Sandler doesn't quite know how to deal with this.  The scene where he asks if they have any books is hilarious!  I love the quote, as he scoffs, \\"I'm reading this Communist books to you!\\"  It is then that the kids convince Sandler to tell them a bedtime story.  As he tells the story the kids ask questions and add bits of their own.  The magical part of the story is that his bedtime stories start to come true - after a fashion - the following day.<br /><br />Sandler goes from misadventure to misadventure as he tries to turn these stories to his advantage.<br /><br />This is a fun family show, though not likely IMO to be a classic with much staying power.  Still, it's well worth a look or two.<br /><br />4 solid stars.
B004B32500|5.0|Santa Sangre brigs the maturity of Jodorwsky. After the trology of The Holy Mountain, El Topo, and Fand y Liz, the director leaves the main role to his sons, who make it very nicely. It`s a pretty narrative about the surrealistic magic aroud the life of marginal artists, artists of life. Maybe Santa Sangre could be a latin-american and contemporary view of Chaplin's The Circus, having in common the beauty, the sadness, and the magic! This DVD brings plenty of extra features, very kind! I've searched a lot for a version with the spanish audio (The film was made in 2 versions, with spanish and english audios), this one brings both!
B005D9B26E|3.0|First off, I love The Who and Quadrophenia.  I guess that's obvious when I just dropped $130 on this set. However, it is a badly missed opportunity. The remix is well done and the book is interesting.  The disapointment I have with this is that only 8 tracks are remixed for multi channel.  They chose DVD-A as the format for the multi channel when Blu-ray audio is available and better sounding to my ear.  The multi channel is mixed to 5.1; there is no original quad mix on here!  Why not have the option to listen to the entire album in it's original Quad mix?  Hey Pete, most of the guys buying this will be in their 40's, 50's and 60's.  Do you really think we want a poster and a 45 RPM record?  WTF?  Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull did a much better job with their recent high end releases.  All three of those have Blu-ray audio, 5.1 mixes, stereo mixes, and quad mixes for the entire album!  The 5.1 mix is pretty good but, it makes me scratch my head why it's not the complete album.  Before I bought this, I honestly thought Pete must have gotten sick of remixing and cut it short, now I see he didn't even do the 5.1 mix.  This project had enormous potential but, it unfortunately falls short of expectations.
1451648537|1.0|The one-star reviews say it all. Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs book is hugely disappointing - a longish magazine piece masquerading as biography. By the end of it, you are no wiser about Apple's true technological achievements, the complex connectivity of Job's life and times, or anything approaching revelation. There is not one goose-bumpy moment in it. In both the products and the company he helped create, Jobs seems to have hurtled towards an almost cosmic embrace of multi-tasking. What an exhilarating life. By contrast, despite his enviable access, Isaacson is resolutely mono-track - the anti-Jobs. His is a pedantic, simplistic and bloated work - the Windows/Android of contemporary biographies. To invoke his subject: It's s- wait, you can say it in life, but not on Amazon.
1607885743|2.0|I \\"read\\" this as an audio book. Unfortunately it was pretty much a dud. It follows the thriller formula pretty well for the first 2/3s of the book, but when the nuts and bolts of the plot get revealed, it's just one preposterous thing after another. In thrillers, the suspension of disbelief already gets a work out, but the author has to at least try to come up with plausible motivations and actions. In this case, the author seems to have said, oh what the heck, they'll buy anything.  The writing is quite pedestrian too. Once again, a few too many adjectives, excessive superlatives, uselessly detailed descriptions and breathless prose is normal for thrillers, but again, it's way too overdone here.  My last gripe is the narration. Ron McClarty is fine, but this is at least the second book I listened to with Orlagh Cassidy doing the female voices and she is painful to listen to. Her main female voice sounds identical to Peggy Hill, the wife in King of the Hill. The character is supposed to be a pretty, sexy heroine and instead she sounds like a southern matron who who has eaten too many prunes. I will not buy another audio book with her on it. She just ruins it.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Just got through the series and it was amazing!!! The first episode gets you acquainted with the characters and has a weird pace IMO but after that the series takes off. It's kind of sad knowing there is only one season. It makes every episode seem like your getting closer to killing an endangered species. The stories though are so dense that there seems to be more character development than in a series with 4 seasons.

0807014273|5.0|The first half of the book begins with his experience in the concentrations camps during the Holocaust. He gives a very revealing and fascination story of this terrible period of human history. Yet, what he shows is that the genocide wasn't the result of the German people, but the cruel nature that all humans are capable of.   The latter part of the book emphasizes his concept of \\"logotherapy\\", where there is a \\"will to meaning.\\" This is where he believes that the driving force to life is not the pursuit of happiness or pleasure or power, but the quest to find meaning in one's life. He doesn't give the answers to the meaning of life to the readers, since it differs from one person to another.   In the society that we live in today, I feel that this book is vital for everyone. Believe what the other reviewers are saying and get this book. And most importantly, read this book with an open mind (and heart).

He cares about horse things: water, grass, doing his work well, and a kind master to work for.<br /><br />He does not know what the different colored uniforms mean; he does not care if the person he is working for speaks English, French or German. He does not understand the forces in the human world that compel men to fight and kill one another.<br /><br />This is the story of Joey, a Thoroughbred/draft horse cross who began life working for the son of a British farmer. Young Albert copes with his difficult and drunken father by training the young horse that his father bought at auction to spite a neighbor. Under Albert's loving tutelage, Joey learns to carry a rider and pull a plow.<br /><br />But when war comes, Albert's father needs the money so Joey is sold to the army. And so begins the adventure of a lifetime for Joey. That first separation from Albert is the harbinger of many partings: the fortunes and misfortunes of war sweep Joey helplessly along. He's a horse caught in a world where machines are replacing horses and bringing new horrors and perils into the world. But while cavalry charges become discredited, horses are still needed to pull the big guns, the supply wagons and the ambulances. Machines can't cope with the mud and primitive roads of the era. Horses are also still needed by farmers.<br /><br />Joey's story brings to life the hardship and suffering of the estimated six million horses that were pressed into service during World War I. It's a powerful, gut wrenching story because most of those horses never made it back to their original homes.<br /><br />Some people would consider WAR HORSE by Michael Morpurgo to be an anti-war story. However, I found this story to be uplifting--Joey, despite all he suffers, retains his trust and love for human beings. He doesn't understand the war or any of the causes of his suffering, but he responds to the people who treat him kindly with love and loyalty. And he meets with many people who do their best to ease his suffering and to take care of him. In humanity and horsemanship, the world is redeemed. This is a wonderful story. Highly recommended. Soon to be a motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg.im kindly with love and loyalty. And he meets with many people who do their best to ease his suffering and to take care of him.

0553805371|5.0|In spite of the controversy this book awakens i would recommend it for everyone even if a supporter of intelligent design. It will surely introduce new concepts in lives of everyone.
0062011847|2.0|I am a huge fan of Discworld, especially the nightwatch stories, but I have to be honest: This does not read very much like the earlier Discworld books. It is painfully slow in the first half, consisting of a lot of strange, repetitive, out-of-character monologues. I don't think I've ever seen Vetinari speak so much or so openly to any one person. He is usually very terse, adding to the mystique that is an essential part of his personality. Not to mention, Vimes and Lady Sybil. I always admired their relationship as a married couple where they both seem to respect each others' worlds (her being a nob, and him being a copper) even when they didn't quite understand or agree with it. There has always been some gentle criticism and wifely nagging in the past, but, when coming from either party, it was always done with tact and grace. In this book it seems like the power balance has completely shifted. Sybil seems to have developed quite a short temper and snaps at Vimes often. He acts like a dog on a short leash around her. And Vimes, who loves his wife more than ever, seems to have developed into a character that is happy to be completely whipped. His policeman persona has changed as well. He's a lot more vulgar, threatening, and skirts ethical boundaries a lot more closely than before, and in some cases acts entirely unlike himself.   /*Spoiler alert*/ One example: In the book Thud, he is lent a fur coat by Chrysoprase while they have their meeting in the Pork Future's warehouse. When Vimes almost forgets to take it off when leaving the storeroom, Chrysoprase calls out that he should give it to his lady. This prompts Vimes to destroy the coat because he never takes bribes. In this book, Vimes has no problem taking a few fine cigars from a suspect's smuggling cache for \\"forensic evidence.\\" In another part, Vimes's demon passenger from Thud is outright relied upon for witness testimony! The old Vimes would've never stood for that because he vehemently never had \\"any truck with magic.\\" It's the antithesis to all police work, wherein it's essential to prove things, but magic is inexplicable. /*End spoiler alert*/  I understand Pratchett's health is declining and considering the circumstances, this is an admirable effort. But if you are one of those obsessive fans, like myself, who is used to Pratchett's A game, you will barely be able to read this. There are just too many inconsistencies in the characters, the flow, and the overall Discworldishness of the book. The essential nightwatch themes are still there (equality, justice, rooting for the underdog) but they're convoluted by all the other stuff gone wrong.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I got this game when it was free but it's well worth the money. It's right up there with Angry Birds and Greedy Spiders as the best Android games.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've been using these for about 2 months and couldn't do without them. For years I've used traditional home theater setups. Most recently I used a mid-range 7.1 setup that was great. I recently moved a long distance into a temporary apartment for a job. There just wasn't room to unpack the whole theater setup. The TV by itself was ok for a while, but I was missing surround. I decided to try these out and I'm really glad I did. It's an ideal solution if space/budget/volume limits prevent you from having a proper surround setup. The experience these provide for the price is fantastic. I can't compare them to other similar surround headphones, but I can say these work great for me.  The surround effect is excellent. I can clearly hear where gun shots and explosions are coming from in games. TV and movies sound good too. They aren't going to out-perform a good traditional surround setup, but I'd recommend these over a cheap 'home theater in a box' setup with crappy little speakers. The XBOX chatting works great. It is wired, but I'm holding the controller anyway so having a wire there doesn't bother me.   They aren't perfect, but any complaints I have are very minor. One of the small cons is that there is only one digital input. These are made for gaming, and aimed at 360 owners, but they work for anything with a digital optical output. I use them for my 360, my PS3, and some of the time for TV watching (for the 'must watch' shows). I have optical cables hooked up to each device and just plug in the cable from whatever I'm using. It's a small hassle, and you could get an optical switcher if you really wanted, but it works for me. It would be nice if they had a few optical outputs, with a button on the headphones that let you select inputs. I think they sell themselves short a bit by only marketing these for gaming.  Another small problem is with very low bass sound. There is a bass boost feature that I leave on all the time. There is almost no bass without it, but withit on it sounds 'normal'. But when a loud, low frequency sound comes through, there is a slight clipping sound, as if the speakers can't quite handle it. There are many shows and games where it never happens, but a bunch of explosions in a movie can cause it to happen.  The battery life is very good. On average, I probably use them maybe 3- 5 hours a day. The batteries usually last 2-3 days. So, definitely get yourself a 4-pack of re-chargeable batteries and always have 2 charged and ready. Otherwise you'll be spending a lot on batteries over time.  The wireless range is more than enough for me. I sit about 6 feet from the transmitter, with a couple of devices in the room using WiFi, and I experience no interference at all. I can get maybe 15-20 feet away before it starts breaking up a little.    Overall, I highly recommend these for anyone who can't make use of a good surround setup for whatever reason. If you're used to just hearing your TV's speakers, they are a must-have.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Fun little game. But like all of them, it gets pretty repetitive after a few rounds. I'd still recommend it tho.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This series was recommended to me by a few people.  I actually ordered it for my wife because she enjoys mystery type shows.  We have both been enjoying it.  I will probably order subsequent seasons.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|This is perhaps the most over-priced item I've ever purchased through Amazon.  After seeing the quality (craftsmanship AND design), I would MAYBE pay $10 bucks...and only if I was feeling generous (and certainly not the $40 Amazon was originally asking for this item).  The plastic/rubber edge is sharp and at places places looks like it's been shaved down with a knife instead of formed in a machine.  Believe me, this is already in the box ready to be shipped back for a refund.  Don't even bother.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Wow!  I enjoyed this movie SO much!  Jim Carey was great in this role.  This is the first movie in a long time that I have actually wanted to tell people about.  I am so tired of all the usual movies.  I do not need explicit sex (that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination), excessive violence and fowl language to be entertained.  Those things do not require any talent.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates quality entertainment.
1439192812|4.0|This looks, sounds, and feels like a preteen book, and maybe it is, but is still very interesting and filled with things you most likely do not know.<br /><br />It's very short, but not in a bad way. In fact, I kind of liked how I felt like I was in and out quickly while coming away from it a bit smarter than when I went in.<br /><br />The coolest thing I think, is that it's a book that you can read as an adult and fully enjoy it, and then pass it on to your kids, who will also get a lot out of it.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|This case is awesome. Looks nice and protects. Upgraded my 3GS to a white 4S and glad I picked this one.
1416594787|5.0|I wasn't going to leave a review, seeing as how there are over 200 5-star reviews already, but after reading through some I feel like I need to.<br /><br />Why do people keep holding against Dawkins the fact that he is not trying to change peoples minds? Would you really care to convince people that the earth is round? That gravity is real? That we revolve around the sun?<br /><br />All you can do is lay the evidence out, and if someone see's it and does not believe it, that's on them. He does that many times throughout the book from what I can remember (it's been a while since I read it). I don't need it to convince me, I need it to fascinate me, which it did.<br /><br />This is like the \\"preaching to the choir\\" complaint I see a lot about Dawkins. I'm not sure if many people know this, but Dawkins knows much more about evolution than most of us ever will. I want those insights and details and bits of knowledge that takes you deeper into the subject, not to be convinced evolution is a fact when I already know it is. That is not why I read his books. If you picked up this book, already knowing evolution is a fact, in hopes to be reconvinced evolution is a fact, I just find that strange of you.<br /><br />In fact, I think that's the great thing about this book. In every insight and detail, you will find evidence for evolution, be it convincing to you personally or not. That is how the book seemed to be presented, to me. I saw it not quite as saying \\"this is why evolution is true\\", but more \\"look at how amazing this is\\" while being evidence in itself. I enjoyed it very much for the pure fact that evolution does fascinate me. This book has probably been the most life altering book I will ever read. It gave me a new way of looking at life, death, and our place in nature.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I recently bought a new HDTV, but when I went to connect it to my existing surround-sound audio system I discovered a serious problem. The new LG HDTV did not have an analog audio output to feed into my audio receiver (several years old, but great equipment). After returning to Best Buy, who had claimed at time of sale that an analog output existed, they finally suggested the FiiO Digital to Analog Audio Converter, even though it was not a product that they carried. They agreed to cover the cost and I ordered the item from Amazon right from their customer service counter. It came in a couple of days and, with minimal installation, I had my sound system connected. I've been using it for nearly two months with all kinds of input into my HDTV and everything has been compatible.  I run regular DVD, so don't know how this would work with Blue Ray quality, but everything else works fine. The cost was minimal, less than $50 for the converter, a 6' optical cable, and shipping.  I could have replaced my surround sound audio receiver for a few hundred dollars. But for those of you who prefer a less expensive solution for new HDTV's w/o analog outputs I would highly recommend the FiiO Digital to Analog Audio Converter.
B005POK858|5.0|Lovely graphics... great old school game play. one of the best RPG's I have seen on the market of it's kind. it's worth the money. but from what I read, don't try to play this on an old slow processor or low ram.   RPG well done!
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|One free app is all they say you get. You guys need to read the descriptions more. Works fine though, EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED. ;)
B005OCFHHK|5.0|What can I say... AWESOME!!! The Complete set on Blu-ray is perfect!!! Great Price, for all 8 movies!!! I've been waiting for this box set since Blu-rays first came out. I know another ultimate box set is coming, but I couldn't wait. I stopped buying the harry potter movies when I had bought half on DVD and Blu-rays started coming out. I did not want to buy twice so I have been waiting for years for this Blu-ray box set to come out. Finally all 8 Harry Potter movies on Blu-ray together... I only bought 4 of the movies on DVD, so I didn't get suckered to bad...
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I had planned to write a review of Lulu by defecating on a computer keyboard, however the logistics proved to be too daunting.  Suffice it to say, this is bad.  To paraphrase Lou Reed, it's like reading Sanskrit to a pony.  God bless 'em for taking chances and following their muses, but...it's not worth a full listen.  Maybe I'll come back to in a few years.  Or not.  What next?  Bette Midler and Slayer?
B0057R5XRG|5.0|1st movie Jurassic Park was one of the best movies I have ever seen, that is why I had to have it on blu-ray. However, Jurassic Park has so much noise in it I can't believe it was even released on blu-ray like this. Horrible! There is so much missing information, that some scenes are nothing but white noise, even some of the well lighted scenes look like crap! Thanks Steven Speilberg, you really disappoint me!!! All I wanted was the 1st movie, the 2nd and 3rd movies looked good on blu-ray, but the movies sucked.<br /><br />The whole franchise was wrecked in the 3rd movie, all the character development and growth Dr. Alan Grant did during the first movie about his fear of marriage, and his dislike for children, was torn to pieces in the 3rd movie. Dr. Alan Grant should have married Dr. Ellie Sattler, and they should have had kids of their own. Dr. Alan Grant should have been portrayed as a loving husband and father, which would have tied the 1st and 3rd movies together and Dr. Alan Grant character development and growth would have been complete. That is how the 3rd movie should have started. In stead some Hollywood dysfunctional producer, payed no attention at all to the character development and growth of Dr. Alan Grant in the first movie, and destroyed the 3rd film, by having Dr. Ellie Sattler married with kids to someone else, and Dr. Alan Grant unmarried, alone, never growing at all as a person. There is nothing to tie the 1st movie and the 3rd movie together, there was no character development, there was no growth in the characters, which for me wreaked the whole franchise...<br /><br />I regret buying this box set... If you don't mind white noise all over 1st movie Jurassic Park, then buy this Blu-ray box set...<br /><br />****UP DATE****<br /><br />I am a idiot, user ERROR... I have such a Great TV that the movie just wasn't keeping up with the picture quality of the my Samsung UN55C8000 LED TV, Once I turned the sharpness all the way down on the TV, Jurassic Park had no noise in it at all, a AWESOME, WARM, Brilliant picture appeared before my eyes... First off I want to apologize to Steven Speilberg, Great Movie, Great Blu-Ray!!! I also want to apologize to all of you who didn't buy this Blue-Ray because of my stupid ignorant comments... I was WRONG, buy Jurassic Park you will love it!!! I want to thank all of you who made suggestions, I listened to them and you guys were right!!! Thank you!!! Now I am enjoying on Blu-Ray one of my all time favorite movies!!! I have changed my 1 star rating to 5 stars rating of these movies... I hope my experience has helped out anyone who is having problems with noise on Jurassic Park, or any other movie on Blue-Ray just turn the sharpness down, and it should look Brilliant!!!SOME, WARM, Brilliant picture appeared before my eyes... First off I want to apologize to Steven Speilberg, Great Movie, Great Blu-Ray!!! I also want to apologize to all of you who didn't buy this Blue-Ray because of my stupid ignorant comments... I was WRONG, buy Jurassic Park you will love it!!! I want to thank all of you who made suggestions, I listened to them and you guys were right!!! Thank you!!!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|htc thunderbolt no problems in the least graphics are excellent BTW wifi not necessary no crash never lost a game
0743289692|5.0|this is definitely a hard one to swallow, however, I certainly reccomend this book to young women aged 14 and older. Ali is an excellent role model and provides amazing insight to the culture in which she grew up.
B0042EJD8A|4.0|I saw part of this movie originally on Link-TV.  It really drew my interest because it investigates the impact of drilling for gas & oil on American land.  It is rather sad how families way of living and health are totally changed after the oil companies began drilling in their neighborhoods.  It also is sad how congressmen are turning a blind eye to the negative impact of the drilling.  I appreciate the information in this movie and will be more active with encouraging people to ask tough questions and hold each politician accountable for any compromise to standard of living in the community as a result of oil drilling.  I learned a new word - fracking and this chemical process is nothing I want in my community.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I like some of King's stuff and some of it I don't but I loved this book. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time wanting to know what was going to happen next.
0307472590|4.0|Si, ya concedo la verdad de las objecciones de las criticas que notan que el estilo de Ruiz-Zafon se deriva de Borges.  Igual yo les contesto que aunque sea una imitacion, es una imitacion buena y sincera, en el mismo sentido de que \\"La Casa de los Espiritus\\" se deriva de \\"Cien Anos de Soledad.\\"  Es decir, \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" es un placer, y mucho mas accesible que \\"Ficciones,\\" sobre todo si piensas comprarlo como regalo para un amigo o familiar que no lee tanto.
0385534639|3.0|This book is such a tough one for me.  I definitely was not a fan of it for at least the first 150 pages.  And I never became a fan of the interspersed 2nd person narration.  But the second half of the book was definitely better than the first.  Do I think the book has been over-hyped to death? Yes. In the end, was it worth reading? Yes. But only because of lines like this: \\"You're not destined or chosen, I wish I could tell you that you were if that would make it easier, but it's not true.  You're in the right place at the right time, and you care enough to do what needs to be done.  Sometimes that's enough.\\"
B000JIHP88|5.0|Love it! Love it! Love it! And so does my son. I have had this for several months and haven't had one single problem.
0316056863|5.0|This book is laugh-out-loud funny. If you're a fan of Tina Fey and her comedy (\\"30 Rock\\"), you'll love this book. If you're not a Tina Fey fan, you probably wouldn't read it anyway.
B005POK858|3.0|I played the game on my DROID X and had no problems. So in response to your &quot;get a real phone&quot;, I have one. HTC......please. I do agree with another commenter from earlier though, try Gurk, you'll enjoy!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This book was hilarious.  Literally laugh-out-loud funny.  The first few pages I was a little concerned because I wasn't feeling it for the protagonist.  But once she starts blurting out all of her secrets to a stranger sitting next to her on the plane, I got sucked into the story.  This book is perfect for a day at the pool or the beach when you don't want to think too hard and just want to be entertained.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Not Just an ordinary ghost tale. Sam and Dean Winchester are Supernatural heroes and the action mixed with subtle humor keeps you coming back for more. I own Seasons 1, 2, 3, 4. 5 is a christmas present and 6 is a birthday present and I am dvr-ing season 7 because it's too good to miss. Order yours online today, Amazon has many titles for sale. Don't miss your chance to see Dean and Sam in action fighting ghosts, ghouls, urban legends, angels, demons, even each other! Supernatural keeps the action coming!! I never miss an episode! :)[[ASIN:B000X5SPBI Supernatural: The Complete Third Season]]
1419702238|4.0|When I received this book on Thursday the 17th, I picked it up and read it right away. I just finished it this morning and had to say that it was only pretty good because it was somewhat hard to tell what what was was going to happen next like during the scene of the Green blotches of spray paint and the lie detector. Book number 5: The Ugly Truth is still my all time favorite. Hopefully there will be a book number 7 that can beat number 5 which to me is pretty hard.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|another great album from Megadeth!! my only complaint about it is if your a big fan like myself you prob already have 3 of the songs from this album on previous releases/remasters or imports. so in the end its only 10 new songs instead of 13, but still well worth buying.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Fast beautiful and useful user interface. This is a role model for a great app. And ... it's free! All the information you'd want as a geek presented artistically.
