B00ANVX6DY|1.0|This item stated that the DVD included an activity kit, stickers and tiara.<br />However, the DVD I received was missing all of them!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Scary good! This show is the creepiest show I have ever seen. The writing is great. The acting is great. A can't miss scary good time and don't forget to turn off the lights!!!
0062197266|4.0|Ever since being captivated by Gillian Flynn's 'Gone Girl', I've been searching for a book that was as entertaining, thrilling, and hard to put down.  I found it in 'Into the Darkest Corner' which deals with an abusive relationship, risky behaviors,  OCD,  and the struggle to be normal again.  Author Elizabeth Haynes tells Cathy's story in a unique way, allowing the reader from the beginning to see Cathy before and after her almost deadly attack by alternating between then and now every few pages.  My only complaint was how Cathy acted at the end of the novel.  Her thoughts and actions were mostly out of character, a shame since Haynes did such a great job building Cathy's character so the reader could really understand and sympathize with her.  Trust me, readers, you will like this book and will be recommending it to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the best app I have ever played  very good and fun so cool l would  recommend this app to anybody who loves horses

B00908DDZM|5.0|I literally listen to this CD cover to cover, DAILY. I'm very glad I bought it at such a reasonable price.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really did like the book, I couldn't but it down. However due to its incredibly violent /twisted content it is hard for me to say I loved it. It truly is a haunting book. Gillian Flynn is a master of mystery, I just wish she wasn't so graphic.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Would give 5 stars if it didn't lag &amp; crash.Makes me feel like a kid all over. I keep losing time playing.
B007XELMO4|5.0|Best camera systems out there and I have bought several. I like this version and bought to attach to bags I own already. But I would choose the the system over this add on option. Still a great choice.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Have to earn points to unlock various games. Some are fun, others I need practice. Only gave it four stars because it takes me a while to earn points.
B004GYY714|5.0|The radio doesn't come in the best in our home but with this app it worked PERFECT! and you can listen to any station you want!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using SwiftKey for quite some time now and I have to say that once u use it u won't try another keyboard app ever. I have the evo 4g LTE and it is super fast n smooth. I even got my wife to swith from swipe now that SwiftKey has the same feature the prediction aspects of the SwiftKey is what got me hooked it has a few bugs here n there but what app doesn't as long as they keep the updates coming to fix the minor bugs I'll keep using it
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I went to bed last night with 20 apples, and awoke this morning to find that I only had 13. With this app, I was able to figure out exactly how many apples little Tommy stole.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Your messages and NDE touched my soul and my heart. Thank you so much for sharing yourself in such a magnificent and profound way. I am inspired to create my heart's work even more now. Bless you Anita!<br />Peggy<br />San Jose, California
0385512058|3.0|I have been in pharmaceutical R&D for 30 yrs. I worked my way from entry bench chemist up to Chief Scientific Officer. I have a PhD and an MAN but the toughest challenge I have faced is leading a large organization with empathy. In my field you are trained to think, challenge and question not to care. I learned that the skills that got me to the top were no longer good enough to succeed. I had to learn how to reach out and connect. This book is helpful in stating how this can be done. It does not state anything earth shattering but it does put into plain English why making others feel valued and important matters if you need to lead them.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I love this game I can only play it a little at a time because it drives me crazy but I like this game a lot.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Very engrossing if not believable.  Kept me interested all the way through.  Rich character formation as trademarked by Grisham novels.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|This is a great read. Very entertaining and funny. I became attached to both main characters quickly and routed for them the whole time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic and fun. It makes me want to be more interactive with my own horses. I am addicted to this game and I really like the daily challenges
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing insight.<br />Hard to put this classic down.<br />I felt like i was there with Chris.<br />While i was reading this book l heard that Chris was killed by friendly fire (sic).<br />God Bless.<br />Rest in peace.
B0095P31L6|5.0|The HD and audio was awesome on my Fire HD. I loved seeing this movie again and it was free. Who can complain about a free movie?
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|I have been using underground weather from the time i got my first computer  in 1987.  I like  it much better then  the Weather Channel.  Like most apps you have  to play with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Have a lot of games on my Kindle but I always go back to this one.  Makes you think ahead, nice progression from easy to hard.  Allows you to replay what you want.  If I remember correctly it will give you 5 free hints.  If you want more hints you have to BUY more hints using real money.
B009POCG2C|4.0|TYPICAL OF THE LATEST ENDEAVORS OF CLINT EASTWOOD. NO DISAPPOINTMENT HERE. GOOD QUALITY SOUND AND COLOR. I WOULD RECOMMEND &#34;GRAN TORINO&#34;.
B006Z21ZEW|4.0|I would have liked to see more of their old songs on here but this DVD is still great. They do an awesome job of presenting it with split screen so that you see two if not three of the band members rocking at one time instead of really fast choppy cuts back and forth. I loved the way they edited the footage together! Great concert!!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is a must have app for amazon shoppers.  You won't be disappointed if you get it.  I love it.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|This movie was funny. Even though the movie was highly sexual there isn't any nudity which is a plus. I will be watching it again
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Amazon double charged me, so my bank account refused second doubled charge. So,  as I began watching, it would stop telling me charge is not complete. I click on other purchase, movie started, I have 10 gb data wifi , movies are no issue. I had issues with this movie, kept freezing, then connection lost. Movie from what I was actually able to see, 1 hour,  was filmed in the dark. The ghostly children were in bad make-up. Not a fan of alcoholism, not sure why they added the main actor to be a drunk, chasing children spirits in the dark with his baseball bat. All while family is asleep. The evil villain's  mask kinda looked like the villain in the scary movie franchise. Did not finish, bummer. I should get a credit.
0060989157|5.0|Good book. book is good. Good is this book. Book book good good good good good good good good good book
B005LAIIPS|3.0|HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE FIGURING THIS ONE OUT. I AM A ROBERT LUDLUM FAN, HAVE READ MANY OF HIS BOOKS AND WAS WONDERING HOW THEY WOULD MAKE A MOVIE OF THIS. THE DVD WAS GOOD. NO PROBLEMS.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I really liked the first Sherlock Holmes. He is one of my favorite sleuths! I really enjoyed Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. I was sorry to see the original Rachel McAdams wasn't in it. But the movie was really great! Love to watch it time and time again!
B009E9QOEO|3.0|This was mixed for low-fi listening, with the bass boosted so high I have to lower my control all the way.
068816689X|5.0|I chose this rating because Edith Harn Beer was a very brave and courageous lady, she knew how to stay alive when jews were sent to concentration camps to either work for the nazies or be exterminated in gas chambers or go into hiding and hopes they would not be found. She married a nazi officer and he didn't even know she was a jew until the WW11 was almost over and he left her and went back to his divorced wife Edith finally left Germany and resides in Isreal, great story fantastic lady
B005T87QCI|4.0|I bought this app when it was a dollar,  and let me tell you it has gotten better.....they used to not even have atom in it..........but now this game is great and the only thing I want to see is an nonlinear mode where you can battle other REAL players
0545128285|5.0|I have been a fan of the Harry Potter series for several years, and for any fan, this is a must have addition to their collection.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|GOOD QUALITY SOUND AND PICTURE. VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE IRISH BROUGE ALTHOUGH IT PLAYED A LARGE ROLE IN THE MOVIE.
B008OOYALE|1.0|they don't count all your money and food want u to pay real Money ofor everything go to dragon vale much better
B008M7JODC|5.0|A real gem I wish I would of set my dvr to record when it originally aired.  I'm a bit of a sci-fi buff and this delivers a solid fix and is done in a stylish way.  I haven't finished the first season yet but know I'll be watching the complete series on Amazon Prime and am thrilled that it's available.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Great game, enjoyable, very easy to use, can't wait for the sequel. I would buy more games from this company anytime
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Read countless times. Always amazing! I love this book! The characters were amazing, the plot realistic, what more could I want in a book?
B0058VW36U|1.0|I paid good money for this game so I would not have to deal with ads. Last game from these guys. When you pay on iTunes, you don't get ads. Not so in the Kindle app store. I am deleting it.<br /><br />Lost the ads. I Will give you give stars.<br /><br />Sick of app developers charging money, then loading it with adds. Very disappointed in Kindle apps.
B0099114WO|4.0|A DELIGHTFUL MOVIE...ESPECIALLY VIEWERS IN THAT AGE RANGE OF THE MOVIE SETTING. GOOD ACTING. GOOD QUALITY DVD SOUND AND COLOR.
B009VLX8FS|1.0|I bought this because the mp3 was .99 cents on a promotion special. I feel like I wasted my money. I needed to find out what the hype was about taylor swift music. I was not impressed.In my opinion she is a TALKER (like Alan JAckson) and so many other country artists. If I want to listen to talking, I'd buy RAP. IMO she NOT a singer. She doesn't carry a tune or have any special quality. I would not recommend this nor would I ever buy T.S. music again
1609611543|5.0|Very informative! I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially those with unexplained health problems. Easy to read, and interesting.
B009OYTIXS|3.0|Firstly, I watch this show on Hulu, not Amazon, and if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't watch it.  The writing's ok, the story's ok, but some of the delivery is pretty cheesy, especially by the main character.<br />I don't watch it for him, tho, but for Paul Blackthorne.  He's got a too-small part as the lead police detective hunting \\"the vigilante.\\"  I'm hoping that one of these days one of his shows will stick around!  I loved him in the \\"Dresden Files\\" show on the SciFi channel (before it became \\"Syfy\\" whatever THAT means), and have tried to catch whatever shows he's landed on since then.  None have been as good, IMHO, (tho \\"The River\\" was quite interesting) and none made it big, but one still hopes...<br />I do also like the main bad dude, who used to play Captain Jack on \\"Dr. Who\\" & \\"Torchwood,\\" and interestingly, in the most recent episode, *spoilers* there was a new character with another Whovian.  Can't wait to see how that develops!  :)
B000PHN4HE|1.0|The comment about the assistant working up an erection (a woody) was totally innappropiate for a family movie.  In fact, that is not appropriate for ANYONE, that is private between a husband and wife!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|All songs on it are great!  I am not a huge country mucic fan but this will cross all genres
B002VPE1AW|5.0|THE COLOR AND SOUND EFFECTS WERE AWESOME!  THIS DVD WAS EXCELLENT QUALITY AND WE WILL GET MUCH USE IN THE FUTURE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This a a wonderful book to just read and enjoy.  There is something happening on every page which makes it difficult to set this book down.  The author suprised me many times with the unique situations he put the characters in and the way they solved them.  I highly recommend this book for a truly enjoyable read.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I loved it was the best book I have ever read this book was published by a great job on this book
B004P8JPS6|4.0|&#34;The Affair&#34; is a good read.  A book I always looked forward to reading every day. Every bit as good as &#34;One Shot&#34;.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This is really fun, but often the game does not send information to your opponent and you have to start over. Fix this, and it's a winner.
B0002C4JE4|5.0|How can anyone at almost any age not love James Taylor as soon as they here him!  If you didn't grow up with  him, you heard your parents playing it!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|FOUND THE STORY LINE A BIT SLOW AT TIMES BUT INTERESTING.  DVD WAS GOOD SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY. GOOD PRICE. NO PROBLEM.
0449808696|5.0|This book is fantastic - I have never been one to follow food giants advertisements nor buy their new products( make most of my food) but it amazes me what they are allowed to pull off in the name of profit .That they are allowed to harm young children! and our ignorant adults are oblivious to the ingredients in most food product ( convience foods) because it is convenient and probably do not know how to cook a meal from scratch as the generations since the 50'. As a result we are what we eat!
B00A83075M|5.0|this is a great movie for the whole family it is super cute and very funny I wont give away any details of the movie but it is a family friendly movie
B006TJXZ30|5.0|It took me quit a while to finally download and  have my favorite program enter this one into it's form. But Hotmail is a very good e-mail app.
B000NIVJEU|1.0|Good deal. Bad bad so very fricken bad movie. The book is so much better. Read thd books do not watch the movie
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy download, works well and a quick helper. Not much scientific there but why more for a free app, it's okay.
B002VECM6S|5.0|THIS DVD WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND EVERYTHING EXCEEDED WHAT WAS EXPECTED. QUALITY OF PICTURE AND SOUND WERE VERY GOOD. LOVED THE STORY AND THE ACTING.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I Love Bruno Mars and his music love the CD so far sounds great got his last CD love love love it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love the range of characters and all the mini-plots taking place. Good insight into World War I and so interesting that the real Highclere Castle experienced such similar circumstances during the war. Couldn't wait to see each episode to see what would happen next! Final episode ends well for Mary and Matthew, which I was happy to see.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Very good search board, just slightly slower than Bing. But still very good app. I liked it because I was a Google fan for a long, long time.
B00ANVX6DY|1.0|I ordered this for my little girl being all exicted she was getting an activity book and tiara but those were not included with my order at all... very disappointed.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Not much there to not like, even so other offerings can be more interesting if you look for more efficient features (e.g. forwarding).<br />A no-nonsense email system for the average Joe like me.
030758836X|1.0|What a waste of time.  The first 4 chapters were enchanting.  Downhill from there.  I can't believe this book<br />is so popular. Every \\"Gone Girl\\" reader I know shares my opinion.  A ridiculous ending.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I love the conversion function, ease changing calculators, and being able to change the theme. I wish I could choose which screens to have available instead of preset options. Still a great calculator.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm hooked on this show! This third season is an emotional roller coaster with high happy peaks and low sad valleys. It is interesting how they dealt with some social and medical issues at that time (the 1920's). The costume designer does well with the 1920's period. Had to buy Season 3 before PBS was done showing it, because I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Season 4 ought to be quite different with the loss of some major characters. :-( Can't wait for it though!

B0058SNI58|5.0|Love these shoes!!  They are very comfortable. But I think they may run a little big. Wish I would've gotten a half size smaller.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|game would not load on my android device your requirement for a minimum number of words is rediculos and my spelling moght be bad
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|Definitely a good read, though not quite as good as the Cat and Bones series. Either way, there were points where I found myself unable to put the book down. I will say however that it feels like the author could've gone just slightly further with the characters, but still a good story overall.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|A good mahjong game. Works well on my tablet & phone and is a fun way to pass the time
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I don't usually leave reviews for books or anything, but I had to for this book. It was the best thriller I have ever read. I stayed up well into the night to finish this book even though I had work the next morning. The story is so gripping and I really got into the story. I think that it was extremely well written and really allowed the reader to feel what the narrator was feeling. I actually was getting a little scared reading this book in my apartment alone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was everything, it made cry,laugh,angry,and happy. I would recommend this book to anyone out there. It was really beautiful and it teaches you a great lesson. Holder and sky's love story was indescribable. Really amazing amazing book. :)
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I should have rented this before buying it, because then I would not have bothered.  The quality of the DVD and recording are great, but the movie was a disappointment.  Not nearly as good as the first two installments.  But, since it completes the series in my collection, I'll keep it all the same.  Can't return it just because I was dumb enough to purchase it before seeing it.  Object lesson for everyone, I think.  Know what you are buying.
0446554995|2.0|Plot drags. Not a pleasant story. Contrived feel. I finished, but it wasn't worth the effort. Characters not who I would follow.
0765325950|5.0|As good or better than Eddings, Brooks, and Tolkien. Rivaling series like &#34; The Heritage of Shannara&#34; and &#34;The Malloreon&#34;.
B000EMFAYK|5.0|One of our favorite Playmobil clickies. Nice detail, great quality, cute and not scary. I recommend the vampire lady from series 2 to go with this guy
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|More great music.  Variety of rhythms and language.<br />What else can I say?<br />When is next concert to San Francisco?
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Very exciting Bond movie. Great action although missed the gadgets but know how that fit into the storyline. Like the old Sean Connery persona
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Love the storyline.  The DVD quality is fine, but it's rare to find one that's actually defective.  Good addition to our DVD library.
B0063IH60K|4.0|same as on my I Phone  Fun and easy to play.  I like the larger format.<br />I also like the winning celebration at the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|All expectations (which were very high) were met!!  An unexpected plus was the beautiful scenery.  Downton Abbey is my favorite program - hate that we have to wait until next year for Season 4.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Intense.  Confounding. Disturbing.<br />  &#34;Flight&#34; is an excellent movie.  It opens with a daytime scene of 2 people in a hotel room who have obviously been partying pretty hard.  Next thing you know, they're boarding a jetliner....they're part of the crew.  Oh yeah, and one of those people are your pilot....welcome aboard.<br />  This is not a disaster movie.  At least not in the sense we are use to.  It's a character study of an addict.  Thing is, you don't hate him.  You root for him.  But not in a rah rah way.  You know this guy.  He's your friend, cousin, uncle, dad.  He's a good person deep down, but seriously, seriously flawed.  You pray he gets the help he needs.  Well, it's never a smooth road.<br />  Denzel Washington is one of our great actors.  He's so good, you kind of take it for granted he'll always deliver a great performance.  He is amazing in this movie.  Think about it...he plays a self-destructive addict who pretty much burns every bridge...and you don't hate him...WOW.  His performance in &#34;Flight&#34; was nominated for an Academy Award deservedly so.<br />Don't pass over this movie.  You'll miss a great film and an outstanding performance by one of our great actors.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Tear jerker! Very powerful, sad and funny. It makes you feel different when it's over. It is a must read.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I bought this dvd for my daughter who had wanted to see it but missed it in the movies.  She loved it! I think she is planning a perks party
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I've had tune in radio on my devices for years now,I love being able to listen to radio stations in other states&amp; I've found a few stations that I'd rather listen to them listen to local, it definitely gives me another option besides the mp3 player. Love this app
0756686970|5.0|These books are so cute!  I bought this for my 10 year old son.  Hes a huge fan of star wars.  This book goes into great detail about characters within the lego star wars world.  Good price!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game installed it for my son and I play it more than him on my kindle and phone.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I feel more informed. I'm glad we watched it. Was it the best picture? I'm not certain it deserves that rating.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoyed this game.. its is actually harder than you think...it helped to excersing my brain. It was very entertaining.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the finest books I have ever read, and A story whose ending I never wanted to see.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander takes the reader on the journey with him,  explaining from a scentific and spirtual point of view, easy to understand.
B00493E1GI|5.0|A good story about running away and finding peace within yourself.  I love seeing the different cultures and places she goes
B007THA4FI|4.0|For the first 30% of this book, I was bored and uninterested.  The characters didn't seem likable to me and I didn't care much for the plot.  But, as time went on, I became more involved in the stories of these tragic characters of a small town even if the plot never really mattered to me.  By the end of the book, I did feel fond of 2 characters and realized the overall development of each one was well written. Although it was a sad and tragic ending, I can honestly say I enjoyed the book overall.  There was some background in the beginning of the book we could have done without- but glad I stuck with it.
B000007WK4|2.0|Chris Rea has always been a favorite of mine but this latest title fell flat on it's face. I got more enjoyment playing his earlier LPs Like &#34;Road to Hell&#34;  This new LP was not as good as his older stuff, same old same old !!!! Listen before you buy
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I have always loved air hockey - and this game is no exception, was very fun and entertaining - it has different levels you can play against the computer.
B005LAIIHG|2.0|A little too preachy for my tastes, condescending, and just overall boring to watch. The CGI was not so good. I never believed the animals were real. Only positive was the underwater scene was nicely shot, that's it. Not worth it for that.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I related so much to this book . I have had my own struggles with mental illness... I was so grateful that he found his silver lining.  I was also glad Tiffany did as well.  I expected this to be just Another romance novel but that is not what this book was about... I also found this book incredibly;  funny, endearing,sad,  and relatable... THIS BOOK HAD A CLEAR AND,PURPOSEFUL MESSAGE! The characters in this book were so realistic and loveable!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was waaaaay better than I had assumed. The fighting was physical and believable. Lots of action and drama. I didn't know Liam Neeson was such a big guy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|What a sequel should be, an improvement over the original. Better graphics, controls, levels...so good. Looking forward to Temple Run 3!!
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|If you are a Mumford and Sons fan then you will enjoy the CDs and the DVD movie. Highly recommend!
B0013TPV0Q|2.0|Although very funny at the start, I stopped reading it around the middle because it became to depressing. Not for me
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt smith is perfectly quirky as the doctor... I have a not so small crush on Amy Pond. It's fantastic.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Last fish is a fun game where you are a fish who is trying to survive in a harsh world. Cool black and white graphics.
B005UG542S|5.0|A wonderful ending to the greatest story ever told!!! I held off on watching this movie, in order to prolong the Harry Potter epic that I love so dearly. This film is filled with courage, love, sacrifice, spirit, and undying human dignity. The first few films were less serious and geared towards a younger audience. But the series grew more serious as it continued, and I believe that the Deathly Hallows, Parts 1 and 2, are true adult films.
0385535147|5.0|Just a great price for another superb lawyer novel by a consistently great author. Little more need to be said!
B007REV4T8|4.0|Although this is not my favorite movie, it does have the same old James Bond storyline<br />Glad it's in my collection however i could have rented it from redBox !
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|This a very good movie! Has a little bit of cursing in it but other than that, I enjoyed it
B006O6F932|5.0|A great gift for a 10 year's old birthday for a even better price.  Came sooner than we expected.  Excellent service.
B007HACDLK|5.0|THIS BOOK KEPT ME INTERESTED TO THE VERY END AS DOES ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE READ OF HIM
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|I rarely give bad reviews, but this movie was pretty bad. I even fell asleep, maybe 2/3 of the way through. There are PLENTY of other movies on Amazon that you can watch instead of this one.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I chose this rating because i love the movie Yes i would recomend this movie to my friends an family.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|Poignant. Really drew me in. One of the better Murakami books I have read. As usual, Murakami gives vivid descriptions of the sights and sounds of a particular corner of Japan that really helps me to immerse in the story.
B00471JSR4|5.0|G I Joe: the rise of the cobra(blue ray) arrived in  time.I was very satisfied with the purchase. would order again
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|This is a great spinoff from Stargate SG-1 and has the same great action, great plot, and has some very funny parts. I recommend this for any scifi fan!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was almost impossible to put down. The writing is fantastic. I was pulled into the story in the very first chapter.  I'm excited about reading more from Hugh Howdy.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Just like everyone else, I love the Dark Knight Trilogy. This movie is magnitudes greater than Batman Begins and sets the tone for The Dark Knight Rises. Heath Ledger is an acting genius. His version of The Joker is as disturbing as any fan could have hoped. I did think that the movie was a little too long though. The whole Harvey Dent story at the end seemed like a tangent, but I guess it was needed to setup the third film.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|My husband and I are huge Castle fans, so I couldn't resist  checking out Heat Wave.  It was very enjoyable, like an episode of Castle and I'm hooked now and will read more Nikki Heat and maybe Derrick Storm too.
B004GYY714|5.0|It sounds great on my Kindle fire hd 7.<br />I am able to get to programs I like.<br />I would recomend it to to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is basically a modern version of the good old tamagotchi, however the horses movement is very lifelike.if you don't spend a lot of time with your horse its health fades pretty quickly so you have to invest a lot of time in your digital pet.
B00BEJL3IY|5.0|i came into this film with decent expectations but when it was over i came out thinking that it might be better than the rock's snitch
0765325950|1.0|First they delay the electronic book release, then they price the ebook at $17 per copy.  This is outrageous.  I'll buy used or at library to finish series.  Not giving them my business.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|I watched this movie because it starred Chloe Grace Moretz, who played Hit Girl in the movie Kick-Ass. She was great in Kick Ass and she is great in this film. Let Me In is pretty dark and has a lot of death scenes, so be prepared for that. Because of the serious tone of the movie, I actually felt more sophisticated after watching it.
B0041V1R7O|4.0|This album sounds exactly as the name indicates. Grinding away each tune to fit within your ear sockets.  Once the processed music fills your head, it will rattle around in your skull for the duration.  Now with this in mind, proceed to buying Grinderman's first album.  Perhaps even some Nick Cave and Bad Seeds for a lovely chaser.
B005B19UPE|4.0|Sarah's Key is a cleverly interlaced tale focusing on 10 year old Sarah Starzynski and 45 year old Julia Jarmond. Young Sarah's story occurs during the 1942 Jewish round-up in France known as the Vel' d'Hiv, where the young girl is faced with many difficult decisions regarding her own life and that of her younger brother's. Julia's story takes place in 2005, where she is living, raising a family, and working as an American journalist in France. Assigned to research and report on the Vel' d'Hiv, Julia's work quickly escalates from a typical assignment to a gripping search for a very personal connection to Sarah.<br /><br />The format of this novel pulls the reader in for an exciting and emotional journey following Sarah's daring actions to save herself and her brother, and Julia's life as she searches for a link to the past. Rosnay teases the reader by providing just enough information about one story, then quickly switching to the next story to keep you thirsty for more information. This book grabs your attention and doesn't let go until all your questions have been answered.<br /><br />I gave Sarah's Key 4 stars because the ending seemed a little weak. While the rest of the story is a non-stop roller coaster of emotions, the ending seems rushed and significantly less emotional than the meat of the story. However, this book is definitely worth a read if you are looking for an easy read and a gripping story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful book!  As soon as I was done I had to see the movie - but the book was so much better!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|hours of my life gone to this game and I don't care. I am quite satisfied. Love the graphics and game play.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|This is a good app for those who enjoy the simple ui. It's straight to the point without any hassle.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I'm a guy who likes the Twilight Saga. I haven't read the books though, but I've seen all the movies. I heard that many fans were disappointed by the final book. Because of this, I avoided watching this movie in the theatre. But since a rental is a lot cheaper than a theatre ticket, I decided to give the film a chance. I was pleasantly surprised and entertained.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fast reading  could not wait for the end  read it on the train<br /><br />Will recommend it to one and all even someone12  years old
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the game subway surfers because it is a simple and easy game to play and you don't have to do anything apart from collecting coins and completing the daily challenges, which I enjoy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great reading keep the series going! I look forward to each release and where the action will take the reader.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I loved this second of the Nikki Heat series. Richard Castle's brand of humor and action is thoroughly enjoyable! Kudos on a fine work of fiction.
B009OWGMYI|5.0|I love HIM, we have all of their albums, this is a great compilation of their best songs.  Great for someone just getting in to them, or for old fans.  Cant wait for the new album next month!
B0041VV03A|3.0|Splice is about a couple of scientists who go against protocol when they hear of news their DNA experiments will be heading in a different direction than they wanted. So they throw together a bunch of DNA of from animals and include some with human, just to see if it can be done. However they intended on terminating the project before whatever they where growing develops. Little do they expect that the growth of this thing would be much faster then they calculated, and something new is brought into the world.<br /><br />They decide not to kill it, and raise it, without anyone knowing, and it almost becomes like a child to them, until it reaches an age where it just does not want to be locked indoors anymore and it's primal instincts begins to kick in, as well as it's hormones.<br /><br />This is not the movie I thought it was going to be. When I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be something like a genetic mutation that looks cute at first, till it goes nut-so. In ways, it is... but not in the way you expect judging from the trailer. It takes a while for any action or suspense to kick in, and by the end, I thought, this is not really what I expected, and that's kind of a disappointment. With the way this movie ended, it made me wonder why they just didn't hurry up and get to what this thing can do, and really play more on shining a spotlight on that, instead of it being over and done so quick with a predictable last 2 minutes of the film to lower the adrenalin so much you walk away yawing.<br /><br />May be worthy of a rental, but definitely not worth watching a second time around.
B00B2064IY|5.0|I listened to this album several times on NPR's First Listen prior to its release to make sure that I enjoyed as much as I did the first time I heard...and guess what? I did and still do, so I broke down and bought it sans any regrets. While I enjoy Jimi Hendrix's music , I'm no expert, but I know \\"feel good\\" music when I hear it and this music is balm and bosom for the soul!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The Downton Abbey Season 1 was great.  It got me and my wife addicted to the show. We even watched it again when Season 3 was over, having Downton Abbey withdrawl symtoms.
B0002IU988|5.0|These guys never fail to rock out for me, I love every song on the album , I love Miles kennedy's voice, and they just rock together!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This is the first of the Nikki Heat series as such we are introduced to a smart, suave and very gorgeous NYPD Detective and her cohorts. I highly recommend this first of the series. Richard Castle's unique perspective on the world of crime is to be commended.
B004S3MB2U|2.0|The regular price is obscenely expensive for this app, but for free, it is a decent calculator. The biggest problem is that you have to be connected to the internet to use it. For that, I am uninstalling it and going back to TI5x.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I love all things Bourdain and this doesn't disappoint. Humorous and real, Bourdain gives outsiders a glimpse of his world, who's cooking our food, and what happens behind closed doors.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great Series ! am really enjoying the series, had to watch Season 2 with the finale of season 1,A must see
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I absolutely love this app. It does more than the expensive sound machine available to buy land it goes everywhere with you. Everyone should have this app!!!
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Game wise this is a, relatively, fun game and something you should at least try if you're a fan of the show<br /><br />P - This game keeps a nice atmosphere similar to the shows with all the ponies running around and playing with each other, the design of the ponies and buildings is nicely done, it's cool that they've thrown in a few of the 'fan-made' ponies, like Derpy or Doctor Whooves, and it's very nice that there's official voice acting for it as well, even if it's only for a few of them.<br /><br />C - There are a few things that aren't particularly great about this game, what game doesn't have a few cons?, but they're nothing that will really bother you and you can overlook them pretty easily, the design of Luna or some of the dialogue for instance, however there are a number of things that can't be overlooked as easily such as ; the cost of certain things being ridiculously high, Celestia, Shining Armor, Cadance and the hospital for instance,  along with the fact that you cannot complete the game without having to spend the gems that take forever to get a substantial amount of or that shutting down the game, even for a few minutes, causes you to be punished the next time you pop in with Parasprites and boulders suddenly appearing that cost precious money and Harmony Shards to remove.<br /><br />While those are very annoying they can be overlooked because of the nature of the game however the one big thing that I cannot overlook is the fact that it is a very heavy freemium game, does pretty much everything it can to make it hard for you thus making you buy a gem or coin pack from them, and the prices for them are ridiculous, and the only real way to progress later in the game is to use your gems which means spending tons of money or just finding cheats, which there are plentu of.<br />One last kind of big con is that you need Hearts for certain quests and the only way to get them is through friends leaving chests or sending gifts to you and this is pretty difficult since their friends list is always having some sort of issue.<br /><br />Overall - This could've been way better than what it is but it's still worth playing a bit before the later parts where it becomes impossible to play without cheats or wasting tons of real money on gems due to the 'freemium' business model that everyone seems to be doing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show and ordering through Amazon is sooo easy! We don't have cable so this is an easy way to watch such a great show!

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This knife is crazy.  Fast shipment, easy business, good product.  The only complaint I have is that the blade isn't very sharp, but that probably has to do with the factory.  Happy.
0670026603|5.0|I am cursing Jojo Moyes for keeping me up 3 hours past my bedtime last night. As a psychotherapist and novelist myself, I consider this to be the greatest form of compliment for a book. I was so engulfed by the deep character development and interesting storyline that I just had to keep reading. Congratulations to Moyes and the editorial team for such a wonderful expression of the edges of human experience.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I liked seeing how the movie was made.  I think<br />the actors must have had some anxiety until the<br />final rendered form was done.
0761536434|5.0|Grandson and his father really liked this.  He likes games and wanted to learn more about them.  He had to hide it because his father kept &#34;borrowing&#34; it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think it was awesome because it gives you the responsibility of taking care of a horse and not to say its FREE !!!!! its a must get this game is the best i love it its for anyone at any age
B001ANSSDC|5.0|definitely would recommend this.  i haven't seen the movie yet, but i loved it as a book. engaging characters, interesting story line- loved it.
B004DHAC04|5.0|Great Movie A must see for todays current history affairs. Buy or Rent it for the entire family. Thank You
0451196716|5.0|Great read as usual by the Great Stephen King. When I saw the Hunger Games, I remembered reading this years ago and had to read it again!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Most fun Sherlock I ever watched.  Have both movies and hope a third will be made, better than the TV show which I would only give 4 stars to.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It was very exciting once again. I really enjoy following the detective(Harry Bosch) as he gets older and smarter. A<br />great, enjoyable read, Again, once you start reading you can't put it down.You don't see the ending before hand, loved it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have a hard time with sims. They move too slowly and waiting hours to do something (unless you pay lots and lots of real money to speed it up)  is really boring and expensive.  I am good with spending about $10 or so on a phone game and that is really my limit barring something truly extraordinary.<br />Pros:<br />1)  This sim moves fairly well.  You can play every few minutes and have something to do.<br />2) AMAZING GRAPHICS!  The dinosaurs are detailed and quite lovely especially zoomed in.  Love the underwater zone especially.<br />3)  Great sounds.  They excite my bird =D<br />4)  Lots of decorating options.<br />5)  Missions given by characters from the movies to keep you hopping, as well as the Code Red mini game.<br />6)  They keep adding to the game: New Underwater Park!<br />7)  Sales and limited time dinosaurs/items/cash every few days.<br />8)  It is free! Consider buying something,  though.  We SHOULD support games we like.  They need to make money to upgrade and make more games.<br />Cons:<br />1) Must be online to play.  So no playing on airplanes.<br />2) Seems a bit hard on phone physically (I have a Samsung Galaxy S3). It gets quite hot and I restart my phone every once in awhile to take care of the heat  and any lag that starts.  But the game is gorgeous!<br />Highly Recommend!<br />Go get it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was amazing in detail of survivors and their stories. The description of the challenges they faced were great and some were just wonderful. However the book never explained how the virus got out of the house the boy was in and spread to hospitals that we'll so I felt loss there. Another thing is the stories after the major war the stories were getting short and not much excitement.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've heard for weeks how I need to read \\"Hopeless\\".<br />Hope.<br />Less.<br />Hopeless.<br />I loved how the book did not have chapters, it had dates. It made the book seem like a journal instead of being  book. I loved the feeling of experiencing Sky's life through the dates. I was first apprehensive about Holder, until Dean Holder showed his true side.<br />Oh Holder.<br />How can you NOT love Holder?<br />Towards the middle of the book, I started picking up on some of the clues, and by the time that I hit 75% done with the book I had so many thoughts on how this book was going to end it was not even funny. I automatically assumed the worst for the characters and hoped for the best.<br />I was surprised with the way that the book ended, but Colleen Hoover did an amazing job keeping the readers on edge, and keeping them wanting to read more. It took me about 3 ½ hours to read the entire book. I believe I could read this book over and over again.<br /><br />5 Stars.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Liked the Broadway Music better.  It will not disappoint and if I did not hear the Broadway verson it would have gotten 5 stars.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put the books down once I started to read. Amazing story that kept you on the edge of your chair waiting for the next anxiety filled action filled life of our heroine.
B008220C38|3.0|This is truly an artistic rendition.  Most of it takes place on a stage, while some of it takes place in a location.  The changes between stage and scene are too rapid and confusing. The cast does its job well, but the artistry detracts from the story rather than enhances it.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The action was great. They needed to leave out the line where James Bond (Daniel Craig) said: &#34;What makes you think I haven't done this before.&#34;
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This App is not loading for us at all. My daughter is very disappointed.  I'm going to remove it and try to redownload it, hopefully it will work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to pass the time. I only have one problem with it, some of the controls are hard. it took me longer to beat those games.<br />  thanks for reading!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Protects kindle very well and is nice looking unit for the price. I like the stand up feature for when I am eating and want to read while I am.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty realistic. The only issue I have had is that I have not gotten all the gems that I was told that I was given or that I have bought. All in all I like this game.
B007SZQXXI|5.0|Can't go wrong with a free Shakespeare book.  The one is simple to read and just has the play if that is what you are looking for.  If you like to read what someone else thinks about the play you just read then this may not be for you.  If you just enjoy reading a good play then throw it on the Kindle and read a couple times.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely love games like this!  Great graphics, fun puzzles and a great storyline!  I will be downloading more games from Alawar Entertainment for sure!
B008X6N1OA|5.0|I dont know if im happy i bought this or not.  I ordered this a month ago and ive watched it probably 48 times with my 3 year old little girl.  The movie is great, but be careful if you have a little one you will become more familiar with this movie than you ever expected lol
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Ben Affleck has show his to grow as a director and actor in recent years. Argo is the next big step for him. This is a taught dynamic effort with brains, pace and humor. Genuinely tense and not patronizing. First class entertainment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful story.  Could not put the book down. Every book I've ready by Nicholas Sparks has been great.  His characters are always people of good strength and realistic.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a fun free game for my new kindle fire. the music is my favorite part because it is very calming.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great graphics, smooth sweeps - there is nothing that I don't like about this app. Mindless fun and it works like a charm.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|There is always something to do and i really enjoy the mini games. It would be nice if you could earn gems faster but otherwise a really good game.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Great for those on the go, easy to check items for sale or items you are interested in. Get updates on the things you use the most, quickly.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The graphics are great with lots of things to do. It took a few minutes to figure out the things the app wanted us to to. All in all great app.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This is a fun yet sometimes frustrating game....I've only gotten through a few floors- would've liked a hint here and there...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is absolutely in love with this App. She loves horses so it's perfect.  The graphics look great and work great -- it's fun for her!
B008CPRLP2|4.0|This app works well with the Kindle, it unziped numerious pictures without a problem, and the price for it was right.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent app for home or on the go. Wonderful valuable information for weather advisory. Can check daily weather easily or 5 day forecast.
B00571F26Y|4.0|This is an interesting read that challenges the dietary recommendations of the FDA.  Eating whole grains may be a cause of the obesity epidemic.  The argument is well presented and discussed in this great read.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|does not get past the loading page and force closed twice already before even getting the chance to play. :(
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend Gracie showed me the game and I loved it that I stay up till twelve o clock at night
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It seems to be written with the teen reader in mind, but Pullman's writing style and concepts are brilliant and worth any adult's time as well.  I would put this on my 100 Must-read list, for sure!
B0000X2EOW|5.0|Super fast shipping!! This has been my fav movie since childhood... cant go wrong... the fact that david bowie is in it should be enough ;-)
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I was warned against this movie, but I watched it nonetheless. Thoroughly entertaining as a mindless action flick. A few minutes of &#34;really? seriously, really?&#34;, but otherwise, engaging.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Not a fan of Anna Kendrick in general but this movie was just--predictable one, and two, just not believable her as this antisocial girl. Not as funny as I expected either, I feel like all the funny parts were in the preview.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|This book is so different from virtually any other thriller read -- and I've read hundreds of them.  Great to see the most clever operator in the story a woman.  Great to have story that you absolutely cannot figure out the resolution of until the last pages.  Just a real treat.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book freed me and I have already purchased copies for all my close family and friends. A must read!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great book that flows all the way through. I love the way characters don't get ignored for too long. Martin has a great talent for keeping the reader engaged at all times. I find its a book I struggle to put down,
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I'm very happy with White Noise. I have downloaded other apps in the past (years ago) and they were all OK, but for whatever reason I didn't end up using them regularly. I think it's partially because I have more free time now, but in any event, this app is getting regular use and I enjoy picking different sounds for different moods. I'm most partial to Tibetan Bowl, when I really want to let my mind wander.
1439165653|2.0|I was encouraged to read this for a program this year.  The colorful possibilities covering four cultures, a variety of foods, music and tastes was intriguing.  Unfortunately the book falls short on several points.<br /><br />This is a very easy read, with good character development, easy to follow story and simple relationships.  The author uses excellent descriptive language to draw you into the story, and it's not hard to place yourself in the various colorful locales he uses in the story.<br /><br />Without completely giving the ending away, I will say that while Hassan has his ups and downs during his coming of age period and while establishing his career, it finishes on a very high note.  For those who like happy endings, this is a very good thing.<br /><br />Now for the not so good...  The author attempts to use an Indian/Arabic accent for the characters which seems contrived and forced.  It doesn't sound accurate and in fact makes the characters a little less believable.  He starts out with the narrator and main character in the book (Hassan Haji) describing intricate details about his grandfather in the food business in the 1950's including his cooking, ingredients, every smell, color, etc...  And yet Hassan is born in 1975 and he is speaking in the first person.  Ooops...<br /><br />Next, Hassan's mother suffers a terrible tragedy and yet the author only spends about 1-1/2 pages covering that and moves on.  For a child, this realistically should've been covered more thoroughly.<br /><br />Then as Hassan moves past the age of 18, we see certain milestones in his life go by.  His internship under Madame Mallory, his first serious relationship with Margaret, his acceptance as a chef at a prominent restaurant in Paris, the establishment of his own restaurant and reputation.  Through this all I keep remembering that he was supposedly born in 1975 and the original copyright for this book was 2008 & 2010.  By the end of the story he is 42 years old, which would make the year 2017.<br /><br />The author mentions one recession around 2008, which would be historically correct, but then mentions another one around the time when Hassan is forty, which would be 2015.  He also mentions a French war briefly, but adds no details.  Is this a future war involving France?<br /><br />He mentions Hassan's hands shaking briefly at the end of one chapter but then goes nowhere with that and it becomes a dead end in the story.<br /><br />Finally the story makes numerous and detailed mention of the selection, hunting, slaughtering, preparation and consumption of numerous animals in almost every chapter.  The use of blood for sauces, slit throats, automatic chicken processing, hunting juvenile boar, etc...  While I'm not a vegetarian by any means, I can see how this book will clearly NOT appeal to any vegans out there.<br /><br />So in summary, while the basic story is good, it has several problems which perhaps should've been worked out before publication.  The contrived accents are unnecessary, the numerous and highly detailed references to slaughtering animals, the dismissal of his mother's death and the timeline problems all make the story less believable.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|John Corey is one of DeMille's classy (and extremely funny) characters and the smartest guy on the block.  This time it seemed like there a tad too much build-up to the action and the very dramatic resolution of the plot.  The first 150 pages could have edited to 50 and the story would have moved into gear faster; a little too much repetition bogged down the pace a tad.  The last 150 pages are incredible.  Take the phone off the hook and lock the door.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|My wife and I are rewatching Fringe first season after watching the 5th season.  It's fascinating to see the original occurrences of things briefly referenced in the 4th and 5th seasons; since my wife didn't watch the 1st season with me (too much goo), I've had to explain the references.  After 4 years, her goo tolerance is higher, and we're both very happy.

I am excited to discover what this genetically gifted artist has in store for us as he musically matures.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|From beginning to end this book was spellbinding.<br />Very fascinating characters.<br />Sorry to reach the end. I would have liked the story to continue a bit.

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Very good game to past the time away. I like it just as much as bejeweled. The music is soothing and puzzles are fun to get through. I recommend this app
B000002IAS|5.0|The CD contains music from a period with a mix of musicians that will never be the same again. And it containes songs of remarkable quality.
B008UX2UIO|4.0|A book that engenders mixed emotions but, in the end, left me strangely wanting more. The characters are, for the most part, loathsome, and their misadventures almost entirely of their making, and yet I found myself wanting more. No idea what that says about either the story or me, but I think it means that this is a good book despite it all. It has some flaws, no doubt about that; Toole fell back on catchphrases far too often (though Ignatius J. Reilly's \\"Oh my God\\" will never get old), the writing is a bit stilted in places, the plot is...bizarre, and some of the characters are paper-thin to the point of self-parody, though I suspect that's the point. The relationship between Myrna Minkoff and Ignatius is singularly fascinating for being something of the ultimate war between damaged souls on either end of the political spectrum. It's a fascinating study of what happens when change is pursued not for a better life or virtue but rather a continuing matter of one-upmanship, tied more to the ego than any noble goals.<br /><br />If this review seems scattered, consider it a reflection of the book itself. The scattershot approach to plotting can be quite confusing; it's not that it's difficult to follow, but more that the reader finds him or herself questioning just where this is all leading, and whether it will make a lick of sense in the end. Why should we continue to care about the owner of a business that fired Reilly? At least one eventually pieces together that Toole intended the angry, senile old woman Trixie as some sort of living symbol of the same hubris that drives  Myrna and Ignatius; that is to say, she's a woman who is perceived as an eternal victim and project by another character, an object for ego rather than a person in her own right.<br /><br />Toole does tie the loose ends of the plot together, but at times it just doesn't feel satisfying. It's not clear that he ever properly answered the question of \\"why\\", except to say, perhaps, that even those of us who most desire to have no life whatsoever still have an impact in their own way. It's a valid point, but the book tends to bash one over the head with it.<br /><br />So, misgivings? Yes, and it's a difficult book to pin down, but overall enjoyable enough to earn four stars, though it may be the first four-star book that I eventually re-read.us who most desire to have no life whatsoever still have an impact in their own way.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Overall I believe it is a great game and very addicting. However once you reach a high level you must spend too many gems and coins to do well in competition. You have to increase your presentation score in order to win. This can be very expensive because you have to use real money to reach your goal.

B003WMA7BU|5.0|You can learn just about everything you need to know about this story through understanding why Sallis never chose to bestow the protagonist with any other moniker than \\"Driver\\". It sounds like a gimmick at first blush, an attempt to a throwback narrative reminiscent of pulp works, and there may be something to that notion, but it's not the whole story. One grows to suspect that Driver's name is intertwined with the truth of Driver's life, that of a man with no real sense of identity and purpose, a living machine of sorts. This is an important point to understand his growth through the novella.<br /><br />The story unfolds in a non-linear format, but we learn that Driver came from a dysfunctional background, one in which he learned to survive by divorcing himself from everyday, \\"common\\" life. Sallis shows this through Driver's recollections of his increasingly insane mother, a woman lived \\"just to the right of the life that everyone else lived\\", to paraphrase. These memories are key to understanding the character, and the character is key to the plot itself.<br /><br />Let's reiterate that: without Driver's coping mechanisms, there is no Drive, or at the very least we read a drastically different tale. So much of the plot's action originates with Driver's attempts to live not just outside of mainstream society but even his own life. As with Ignatius J. Reilly, Driver experiences the consequences of attempting to sidestep life and live int he shadows. As the story progresses and Driver is drawn deeper into the underworld, so too do we  see hints of a personality under that machine - a man that exists almost entirely in the shadows. It's no coincidence that his driving jobs begin to taper off as his personality (and the attendant emotions) emerge.<br /><br />Even the most powerful members of the criminal underworld are crushed under Driver's wheels as he plows forward, relentless and unstoppable, a machine driven by long-repressed emotion. This is a hard-boiled crime story, and a violent one at that, but it's also quite a good character study and worthy of your attention.story, and a violent one at that, but it's also quite a good character study and worthy of your attention.

B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Not many film director's have that kind of guts, but when they do and cannot totally pull it off? Bad news.<br /><br />Pop-quiz: based only on this film, can anyone tell me the specifics of Anna's inner turmoil which actually led her to the brink at that moment? I know it is hard to portray a character's inner life in film, but this story demands it all throughout. Plus we missed out on the scene where Konstantin watches Kitty ice skate; we missed everything important in exchange for what made  the most dramatic scenes possible. We don't really get to know these characters.<br /><br />But some slack, I cannot imagine thinking one could reproduce Russian literature in a film. It is just too internal, to detailed, too long!<br /><br />Yes, it is splendidly beautiful to look at and the actors portrayed their characters very, very well, but the tortured use of the stage-thingy? No. It played off just gimmicky, and so reminded me of Moulin Rouge (which I LOVE) that I half expected someone to break out into a pop song at any moment. Sadly, that might have been a more profound choice..

0060873175|1.0|Basically \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\".  And you'll feel like you're 9 years old when you read this, because that's about the level of the dialogue written here.  Grad students just don't talk like that, explaining things to each other on a 6th grade level.  Cringe-worth dialogue.    I suppose Richard Preston is responsible for the dialogue, but the problem is the central plot element is all Crichton.  I'm not kidding - it's a magnetic device that shrinks things - including people.  People for example can be shrunk down to 1/2\\" tall.  Andromeda Strain was plausible, Jurassic Park was plausible, but this is just nonsense.  Did Crichton really go to these lengths just to expose us to the world of small things in nature - a world teaming with mites and worms and tiny organisms that we otherwise wouldn't pay any attention to?  There's even a point in the book where a character asks \\"If we were shrunk down, our molecules had to shrink too.  So could we interact with the world around us?\\"  Ironically, the author never even bothers to have another character even try to answer that question.  The answer, of course, is no - shrunken people with shrunken molecules could not possibly breathe or interact with the world around them.  It would defy the laws of physics, let alone would they even survive the shrinking process.    I really wanted to like this, and at the very beginning I did - I was intrigued by the private detective and pals, and death by little slices.  It got really bad really fast after that.  I haven't read all the Crichton books, but surely this is his worst.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|I can't help but laugh at the reviews regarding the preachy narration. It definitely is! And the music makes the film even more laughable. I get it that they are trying to be earnest, hip, and modern, but the DMB even sounds dated today, just a few years after the film was made. It'll be even more hilarious in 20 years. There's very little of Robert Redford's narration--most of it is supplied by Wade Davis (of Serpent & the Rainbow fame--you know, the zombie researcher from Harvard). Muting the audio would help immensely, as the video half is watchable (be prepared for a few still pics of RFK in his heyday). The white water rafting scenes were enjoyable in 3D, & there really is no way you could get as good a view of the Canyon in person. Plus, with this DVD, you can visit the Grand Canyon while sitting on your couch enjoying air conditioning and cold beverages. For under $15.

030758836X|1.0|What this book lacks is character growth.  The style is interesting, with two voices alternating, one if which we learn is false, followed by the true voices of the main characters in part 2. The twist in the middle is a coin flip to figure out; like all mysteries the author simply withholds the information you need to \\"solve\\" the mystery. But the very anticlimactic ending is very I satisfying because neither character GROWS. What is the point of investing many hours slogging through a novel if the protagonists remain unchanged from beginning to end? Answer: none. I wish I'd never read this book.<br /><br />Spoiler alert!  So the villain wins, I can live with that. Some of the best books I've read involve the hero making a crucial mistake and paying a heavy price. But this hero, Nick, loses his nerve and then loses it some more.  Near the end he seems to be growing a spine and then it turns to jello. Amy weaves a poisonous web, allows her victim to survive, but traps him forever.  She is evil from beginning to end, he is a coward from beginning to end. Ugh! ONE of them needs to change in some way! Ms. Flynn, I was going to read your other two books but this has out me off for good. And of course the man is spineless and weak...smacks of blatant misandry!<br /><br />Some readers may feel that the revelation of information along the way, such as Amy faking her own disappearance or Nick revealing his affair, represent character growth, but it does not.  No matter what point in the book you choose, both Nick and Amy would react exactly the same way to a plot development.  AS, for that matter, would the investigating cops, Nick's lover, Amy's parents, Nick's sister...everybody.  Nobody learns anything in this book...most of all, the reader!  So sorry I read it.

B0090CVJZ4|5.0|I recently had to reconfigure my built in 5.1 system and found the wiring a nightmare. Some of the wires were marked incorrectly so I had to determine which wires were for which speakers. I wish I'd had these plugs to simplify the process. I have used plugs like these before, and I have to say the quality of these banana plugs were as good as the Monster Cables plugs I used in my music room which is not uncommon for AmazonBasics products. They tend to be very high quality - for a lot less money. i highly recommended them!

B005LAIHVI|4.0|while this movie fell short of my expections (most recent hollywood films have been falling short of my expections lately)there is still a lot to like about the movie story is good nothing special but is still good. its basically a simple adventure story main charactor has to rescue the princess from an amry of giants. the biggest let down for me was the ending. I thought that the giant army would battle the human army now does this happen my answer would be both yes and no (i will let the person watching the film decide for themsevles) i guess my problem was i had high expections for this movie and it fell short of what i wanted to see but still check it out its a great movie in its own right and its still very entertaining just don't have high hopes for anything super super epic. is it epic again i answer both yes and no but again its still worth watching

B00B2G2RG6|3.0|I watch because of Kevin Bacon. Kevin is not his usual excellence. Why? I suspect because of his inexperience in acting in TV series. I understand though. It take time to prepare and Kevin does not have time enough to get into the acting. And the character Clair has the good fortune to have kissed Kevin and Timothy of Justified. Three stars because I know it will be better Season Two. I hope then a believable plot will be offered.<br /><br />No, I will not pay for a Season Two, if there is one, which I say there will not be a Second season.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon: Kevin needed easy money. He signed a contract for easy money. Kevin walks a thin line here. If I did not know Kevin, I would never watch a movie with him as a primary player - based on his performance in this series. And the story.  Way too predictable, way too easy devices to creat fear, for instance, the buried alive female character.<br /><br />Value of each episode: $.75, yes, I mean to say 75 cents.<br /><br />I just watched Episode 15.  The Joe Carrol character's accent is silly. The missed sniper shot of  the Ryan character hit another officer. Too obviously illogical to the plot. And so unbelievable. The final scenes are a mish-mash of several films and TV shows childishly done. Every scene is easily predictable. This series is silly. I assure you that I will not waste my money on a second season. Watch Justified for excellent acting by all, the viewer cannot predict what will occur. Justified is an hour long show that goes by so quickly because of the suspense that I think that I just watched a 10 second show.

B00867GJYK|5.0|It's really hard to believe that ten years has passed since Finding Nemo came out, and this is the anticipated blu ray release celebrating that time.  First, the movie looks like it was made for blu-ray.  I saw so much more detail than I ever did before.  Also, once again they put in a whole second disc just for special features (which I always love).  There's a very interesting chat between the creators as they met up again after ten years.  It's things like this that really lets me appreciate a film even more.  I highly recomend this movie in some form, and if you can this combo is the best.

0312323867|4.0|I decide to read this after watching Something Borrowed and really liking the fiance-stealing cattiness of the female friendship. It overlaps a lot with the movie, I guess, because the producers/screenplay writers need materials for the movie. It's a good read.<br /><br />However, the main character Darcy's lifestyle is extremely unrealistic. I know because I live in New York. On a publicist's salary (even a successful publicist), she someone manages to afford a spacious 1br apt on the UES, designer clothes from head to toe and taking cabs everywhere. To afford that lifestyle in NYC, you have to make at least 200k. And a mid-senior publicist's salary is more like 25% of that...
B00A83075M|5.0|If you grew up as video games did, changing systems from Atari to Nintendo to Genesis to x-box or play station to future generations thereof, you'll probably think this movie is awesome. Some of the really serious crowd may want to view some scenes frame by frame to see how many characters they can identify. I'm not that serious, but I did enjoy the cameos of characters like pac man and the rootbeer bartender.<br /><br />Summary: Ralph's the bad guy, but he's not appreciated by the people of Niceville. So, he decides he wants to be a good guy for a change. If he can just earn a shiny, gold medal, they'll see what he's worth and accept him. Things go rapidly downhill then uphill from there.<br /><br />Is it a kid's movie? I'm not sure I'd show it to a very small child, but most pre-teens and teens would probably enjoy it. Disney threw in some random social commentary that I raised my eyebrows at, but just take it for the fun story it is and don't over-think anything ... and you'll probably enjoy it a whole lot more.<br /><br />The music fits; the graphics are decent; the story's simple but fitting. It's definitely worth watching.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I used to really hate this movie as a boy.  I think it was from most people labeling this film as a girl's movie.  As I've gotten older I've really come to love it, and it's definitely my favorite Disney film of all time.  Does the film transition well to blu-ray?  It's become even more beautiful.  Unlike the Lion King blu-ray, this set comes with an entire disc devoted to the special features of the film.  If it hasn't already, this movie should be returning to the Disney vault soon, so I would suggest buying a copy before they're gone!

B0036TGT3E|5.0|The Lion King is considered one of the last really great Disney animated film to have come out in recent years.  While the company is making the effort to get back into 2d animation it still hasn't reached the level of this film.  I would have to choose between this and Beauty and the Beast as the best of Disney's animated films, so naturally it makes a very good transition to blu-ray.  The only problem I have is with the special features.  They have a few things, but honestly it's very lacking especially compared to the platinum edition dvd that came out years ago.  Other than that, this combo pack is worth the price.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film is a wonderful look at life.  A multi-generational perspective on what matters most.  Sonny's tagline is a keeper...  \\"Everything will work out all right in the end, and if is isn't alright, then it almost certainly isn't the end.\\"<br /><br />Enjoy!

1476719071|4.0|I was glued to this book from beginning to end. The dysfunction of Travis and Abby was so crazy I couldn't put it down. I would kind of equate it to watching a train wreck. You don't want to see it, but you can't look away either.<br /><br />Travis is the of guy that all the campus girls want even though they are going to be used and discarded without a second thought. He's into underground fighting, drinking, and chain smoking. He doesn't form attachments to women—until he meets Abby. Then he basically becomes an overbearing, controlling, needy stalker. That combined with the fighting and drinking makes for some interesting situations. He can go from being sweet and thoughtful to insanely crazy within a blink of an eye.<br /><br />Abby seems to love to torture herself. She wants him, then she doesn't. She and Travis seem to feed from each other's drama.<br /><br />One thing is for sure, this is a drama-filled story. There is always something going on and no dead spots. With all the craziness of these characters, I never found myself bored with the story. I guess dysfunctional people need love, too.<br /><br />*Book Hollow*

0765348276|4.0|Very well crafted space opera from the perspective of one enlisted soldier who happens to enlist at 75 years of age.  Turns out everyone else in his army did as well.  Scalzi adds a lot of humor, world building, action and enough science for those who desire it without turning off those that may not want it so much.  There isn't a lot of sermonizing about the bad and good in waging wars.  Its' mainly the story of people who leave one life behind for a new one because they feel the one they are leaving has been complete.

Well, mostly, but not without it's fair share of faults.<br /><br /> For those who don't know, The Hobbit follows the tale of Bilbo Baggins, and acts as a prequel to The Lord of the Rings. The Bilbo in The Hobbit is not the one were used to. He's more or less the epitome of a normal hobbit, spending his days reading, eating, and smoking his pipe. And having no adventures. And this is how he likes it. That is until Gandolf shows up at his door, with a very unusual proposition. This is where the story really begins, that of the dwarves quest to reclaim The Lonely Mountain, and the finding of the one ring.<br /><br /> Bilbo is easily the focus of the film, and rightly so (it is his story after all). Martin Freeman does an impeccable job at fleshing out a character that we didn't really know yet. He has just the right amount of wit without coming across as a fool, and manages to make Bilbo an immediately likable character. The rest of the cast mostly serve to give Bilbo someone to talk to, as they never feel very fleshed out. Gandalf is more or less the same as he ever was, but he doesn't ever really feel like Gandalf. There's so many scenes of him saving the company, that he starts to just become a plot device to get them out of whatever mess there in. The dwarves aren't much better, as there are so many of them that there simply isn't time to give them all a proper development. The one character that does manage to match (and maybe even surpass) Bilbo, is Gollum (played by the immaculate Andy Serkis). Gollum isn't just the husk of a lost hobbit, trying to reclaim the ring he so desires, he's so much more. Gollum was always somewhat creepy, but here he's downright terrifying, with his glowing eyes and the way he silently moves around the screen. It's an amazing creation of Serkis and CGI, that really strikes home just how dangerous Gollum is. It also manages something that the Lord of the Rings never could: it makes you feel sorry for him. Amiss the outbreaks and the twisted ramblings of his darker side, you can see what he used to be, and you feel sorry for him. It becomes plain just what the ring did to him, something that was never fulling got across in the other movies.<br /><br /> Right from the start, The Hobbit is a much more lighthearted and funny movie than any of the three middle-earth films that came before it. There are songs, one liners, and plenty of deadpan humor from all the characters. This is a welcome change, and helps make the movie a lot more charming, but it's also where my first problem with The Hobbit is. It seems that the makers of The Hobbit didn't know what they wanted from it, and as such it goes back and forth between the lighthearted tale of a hobbit getting out of his comfort zone, and the epic battles of the previous trilogy. Early on the group is sitting around a fire, when talk turns to a battle of the past. The scene then switches to an image very reminiscent of the opening of A Fellowship of the Ring. The problem is that it just doesn't feel right with the rest of the film. The Hobbit isn't the same movie as it's predecessors, and when they try to make it that it doesn't work. This feeling of treading on the same ground is something that is with the Hobbit through to the end. Almost everything just feels like we've seen it before, be it the jumps in the mine or the visit to Rivendell, it just seems like a repeat. Some of this is do to the plot of the original story, but mostly it's the way it's presented. The music was also a bit of a let down. Sure, they have parts of the original soundtrack, but for the most part it's the same one piece being played in every scene, and that piece just isn't nearly as epic as Howard Shore's score for Lord of the Rings. Maybe it's unfair to be comparing it so much to it's predecessors, but it pays homage in so many ways to them that it only feels right to. There are several scenes interspersed throughout that, while never in the actual text, do a good job of linking the two trilogies. This is a welcome addition, but it does mean that the two should be judged against each other as they are very similar in the end. The ending is also a bit annoying. They do a good job of giving you closer, but the last few moments are so cliche that they really don't need to be there. It's a minor issue, but something I thought worth noting.<br /><br /> Overall I enjoyed my time with Bilbo. There were some hickups and misteps, but it was still a good film. At it's best it manages to give middle earth a sense of humor and charm we haven't had before, and it fleshes out much of Bilbo's character and past more than the brief introduction he had in the other films ever could. At it's worst, it's trying to be something it shouldn't, by turning the Hobbit into a Lord of the Rings knock off. If the next two films can change this, then the Hobbit could sit beside Lord of the Rings as another blockbuster trilogy. As it is, it's a good film that any fan of Lord of the Rings is bound to like, though it's unlikely that those turned off by the other films will find anything more to enjoy here. It's good, not great, though always a good time.<br /><br />Final Opinion: 7/10 Goodnd that piece just isn't nearly as epic as Howard Shore's score for Lord of the Rings.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|I am not sorry that I purchased &#34;Flight&#34;.  Denzel Washington was great, but after about an hour, it became predictable.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This was such an amazing book! Will & Layken have amazing chemistry and once you read this you will want the next one immediately!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Okay well as you can tell from my title I thought it was a great book. The writing is superb and the story line kept me interested throughout. Typically I get bored and very distracted when a book switches from one characters narrative to the other but not with this book! No way. I found myself rooting for both of them... I don't want to give too much away but I found guilty pleasure in both side of the story and would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers, mystery, crime, or scandal. I didn't know how the book would end and boy was I surprised! Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Zeptolab should be a name you know well. Creators of the massive hit Cut the Rope, the developer has undoubtedly shown it knows what makes a great mobile game. But unlike a lot of IOS and Android developers, they aren't content to just continually iterate on there winning formula while raking in the dough. Enter Pudding Monsters, Zeptolab's newest creation. It has just as much polish and charm as Cut the Rope, but can lightning really strike twice? Unfortunately, this one hit a few yards away from greatest .<br /><br /> Gameplay is paramount in all games, but is most important for ones designed to be played on smart phones. Few people are going to take the time to watch a long story unfold, or read dialog balloons, they just want something fun to pass the time. The gameplay in Pudding Monsters reminds me a lot of an old game called Slider. You control the jello blobs by sliding them around the screen in an attempt to connect them all together, forming a giant mass of eyes, hats, and mustaches (yes, pudding can grow a mustache). The catch is that once you start moving you can only stop by running into wall or another pudding ball. Over time new types of obstacles are added, such as sleeping blobs, or portals that clone the jello when it passes through. This is the same way Cut the Rope was laid out, with one major difference. In their previous game, Zeptolab separated the different powers and obstacles into there own sets of levels. You got plenty of time to learn a new tool, but it never outstayed its welcome. Pudding Monsters on the other hand simply separates into groups and doesn't follow any real rhyme or reason. You'll just be getting the hand of using the green slime blob, when it starts throwing something new for you to mess with. This could work in theory, but the way it's laid out it makes for a real lack of difficulty stability. The levels go on a sort of roller coaster, giving you gradually harder challenges only to drop you back down to super easy ones whenever the game has something new for you to learn. Considering there are only 75 levels, this leaves little room for much of a challenge. I breezed through the game in about an hour, grabbing all three stars in the levels while I was at it. While some might appreciate the more forgiving nature of the game as opposed to Cut the Ropes sometimes extremely hard scenarios, I just found it dull. The few levels that did give me trouble never felt very clever either, and only annoyed me after the easy ones before. Maybe Zeptolab will get better at this with future level updates, but only time will tell.<br /><br /> Aesthetically Pudding Monsters is an absolute joy. The blobs are bright and colorful, with little touches like pan hats and sleeping caps giving them a bit of personality. Everything is sharp and clean and runs without any hiccups in frame rate or control. Having to load each level is a bit disappointing when their previous games only loaded once at the start of a chapter, but it's not that problematic as loads are generally pretty quick. The music never stood out to me, but it compliments the game well and sets a sort of monster movie vibe. Zeptolabs clearly understands the importance of presentation in mobile games, and does a good job of making their game stand out from the dozens of new games released every day.<br /><br /> Pudding Monsters is a bold move for Zeptolab. They could have simply kept releasing Cut the Rope levels and updates, but they chose to try something new. While it isn't on the same level as Cut the Rope, Pudding Monsters is still worth trying. I'm sure it will be a huge hit with the great graphics and cute characters, though I hope Zeptolab can find a better balance with the difficulty if they hope to have this top the charts as long as there other games did and still are. Considering it's free, there really isn't any reason not to try it, just don't expect this to be the second coming we've been waiting for.<br /><br />Final Opinion: 7/10 Good10 Good
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book continues to drag you trough the unimaginable terrors that our beloved characters must face. Always a new fear around the corner. Emotional, violent, and heartbreaking.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'm not into that kind of tale but well written for fiction.  I would recommend this book to children ages eight to adults.
B0063M22QO|4.0|A Lot like the original .....love it so far so easy at first then gets harder as you go good time passer.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Fantastic performance from Denzel with a great line up of  actors as support. On a plane losing everything inside the cockpit from upside down and hitting a church top and crashing with survivors. now that is all action which to me sounds good. You name it and it happened, A drunk, crooked lawyers, now we are getting somewhere, want more clues okay one more it has you wondering all the way through is he guilty or not.  Marvelous story worth watching different with a twist. I rated this movie an A grade plus, so get the shoes off relax and enjoy with this magnificent piece of entertainment for a night in
B00AECGQF2|4.0|I love this game but I gave it 4 stars because I think that you should make your own character because the ones that they give you are so ugly ans like only 2 out of 6 are good.
B00BOL22GY|5.0|Vikings haven't had much luck on film. Kirk Douglas' 1958 [[ASIN:B001EYYYP8 The Vikings]] is probably the most successful attempt, although [[ASIN:6305692688 The 13th Warrior]] was good for what it was. Apart from these films and comedic appearances such as [[ASIN:B0047C4KBW How to Train Your Dragon]] their appearances have been pretty consistently bad. Which is why it's so wonderful to see not just a good Viking film but an entire series.<br /><br />The most impressive thing about this series is that it really manages to make the Vikings the perfect mix of bloodthirsty savages and adventurous explorers. You want to root for Ragnar and his desire to do what no Dane has done before and sail west to unknown lands, yet in the end he wants to go there because they have a lot of wealth and treasures he can steal. They don't nicen up the pillaging either. The men are all killed or enslaved and it is clear that the women would have been raped if there had been any. They seem quite disappointed to not find any amongst the monks. Their attitude to violence is usually one of complete indifference.<br /><br />In general the characters seem like they belong in their setting. And they do have some great characters. Ragnar has a perpetual smirk on his face that alternates between being friendly and being deadly. He always looks like he's two steps ahead of everyone else, even to the extent that he has visions of the gods. He's eager to explore and ambitious to do what nobody has done before. Travis Fimmel (who I've never seen before) is really good here since he manages to seem quite clever even while being a brute and looking a little bit mad with his crazy blond mohawk and cold blue eyes. Jarl Haraldson is the most quiet and low-key tyrant you can imagine, and feels a lot like the paranoid ruler so common in Scandinavian history trying to terrorize everyone so that he can stay in control. He's played by Gabriel Byre, one of the only actors in here I can recognize, and seems to have a tragic past leading to his current paranoia. Floki is named after the god of tricks, and he is suitably bizarre even when he is coming up with unique ideas as the shipbuilder. Ragnar's brother Rollo is fierce, but competitive and somewhat shifty. Ragnar's wife Lagertha is a tough and powerful woman and their interaction always seems real even when it gets casually violent. And I quite liked Ragnar's son Bjorn since it's rare to see an accurate look at how a child lives in this kind of world.<br /><br />The sets, costumes, and locations really do look wonderful. I understand they filmed this in Ireland but it does look Scandinavian. The harbors even look somewhat fjordy even though I know that isn't really a Danish thing. Not that I'm sure it is taking place in Denmark, it just seems the most logical place. They just say Scandanavia. Only thing I gotta wonder: why is it foggy all the time? I don't remember seeing one sunny day. Just because a film takes place in the Dark Ages doesn't mean it has to be literally dark as well, yet I can remember very few Dark Age films that don't go for this bizarre lighting style. Seriously, try and think of one. But I have to admit that it certainly does make the place look beautiful. There was a lot of money put into this series and it shows. It doesn't have the scale of something like [[ASIN:B008CLI4N4 Game of Thrones]] but it makes up for it with its location shooting and detailed sets.<br /><br />This series is intended to be a more accurate look at the Vikings than has been shown before. Yes, they make some errors here and there, but on the whole they do a good job. The sets look right for the period and they don't force the leads to look less bizarre than the background characters. The only remotely clean-shaven ones are the monk and the jarl, who has only a mustache. The primitive compasses and ships really do seem like a major innovation and they make good use of their time to show how Norse law and society worked. Thefirst episode actually focuses on the coming of age ceremonies for Ragnar's son. The biggest problem I can spot with it historically is in the timeline. Ragnar Lothbruk was the leader of the Vikings that attacked Paris in 845. That's one of the only facts we know about him. Supposedly he was killed by king Aella (r. 862-867) in Northumbria and his sons invaded England in revenge. But this series starts with him in perhaps his early 30s in 793 leading the attack on Lindisfarne, the first major Viking raid. That'd make him over 80 when he hits Paris and 100 when he is killed in England. If they're moving him earlier why not just make up a different character? But I think what they're going to do (since the cast list includes a King Aella) is simply move everything forward by about fifty years. Which means the series will likely get more annoying to historians as it goes on. Ah well.<br /><br />So the History Channel turned out a pretty good fiction series. I'm impressed. They were in quite the rut before. It's nice to see them turn to something that's historical but doesn't involve Nazis or aliens. Hopefully they can keep churning out quality historical series in amongst their usual documentaries.first episode actually focuses on the coming of age ceremonies for Ragnar's son.

B000FCKIFU|5.0|Baldacci is rivviting.  Great read.  Read 4 of his books and will read more. Exciting.  His charachters are well described and ll carry a personality complimentary to the story as well as to each other
030758836X|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  But, I did finish reading it anyway so I guess it wasn't totally bad. I got almost half way through before it even became a little interesting.  The author has a very poor writing style which didn't help in getting me engaged in the story.  I can't believe that this book is on the best seller list.  And as other reviewers have already mentioned the ending was not good at all.  In fact, I didn't even know I had read the ending until I was into the acknowledgments.  Don't bother with this one.
0307720748|5.0|Generally I'm not a fan of reading biographies (that's what wikipedia is for and in a compacted manner) but I really enjoyed this book because of the depth of the stories and I could not put down the book. I wanted to know how Branson started each company, how he conquered the world. And at the same time, i'm studying the text to see the lessons that can be applied to my own life.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I love the tap feature.  I play it on my Kindle Fire HD so the screen is not as big as I'd like it to be but the app itself is great.
B004EPZ034|4.0|This was the first chipmunk movie my son watched and he just fell in love with them!  Of all the chipmunk movies, this one is the best, which it's light hearted nature, music, and even it's lesson in understanding as Alvin learns what it's like to have someone else like him around ;)  Definitely a winner!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does everything I want it to do plus more. Nice big digital numbers that show up nicely at night. Only downside is leaving your kindle plugged up all night is a must or battery will drain but I had to do the same with my phone and that clock doesn't have all the neat features that this one does.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|Since it will not accept my Linkedin password to log in to Linkedin, it would appear to be pretty worthless.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|Just listening to this album today. I couldn't help but think how different this music is to the first groundbreaking Jimi Hendrix Experience albums. IMHO, Those first three albums are just incredible, brilliant, fantastic pop rock, etc, in so many ways. And it's the music that people that love Jimi have in the back of their heads when praising his achievements. That was when Hendrix produced the most incredible psychedelic rock that has never been surpassed since. His early albums had killer songs in the 3-minute pop format(most of them anyway!) that displayed solid rhythmic structured rock music that was completely new and original. His early material had excellent lyrics, melody, great memorable solos, amazing guitar work, avant garde, etc. He melded R&B, blues, rock, soul, even jazz, into his own brand of rock that was NEW, FRESH and of course GROUNDBREAKING even to this day. Not to mention the great mixing/experimentation by Eddie Kramer and Hendrix. Which only gives a listener so much to go back and listen to again and again to some amazing lush plate reverbs, echo, stereo panning, stereo flanging, etc.  But by the time that you get to this period, Hendrix was going for a more soul, R&B type sound that is not as focused (Band of Gypsies is one of my favorite albums by the way!!!!!). Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to put Hendrix down! Jimi Hendrix is to me the best rock artist/guitarist ever in my book. And his guitar playing is always great to listen to because of his true and honest expression and improvisation as a guitar virtuoso. But, these songs suffer from too much guitar rambling through the whole of the songs. Unlike the earlier JHE. where the rythym guitar is the main focus with well structured solos that comes and enhances what is there where a break is expected. Perhaps these songs and new direction that Hendrix was gravitating to were not fully realized or produced. I enjoy listening to any Hendrix and there is great playing here. But man, those first 3 studio albums, plus live at Monterey, and Band of Gypsies are for me the best that he put out. I agree that this is more of the scrapping of the bottom of the barrel as others have mentioned in their reviews<br />Thanks Jimi, love you where ever you are!<br />Peace!
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This DVD brought me back to listening to Pearl Jam in high school. It has some great behind the scenes footage and wonderful interviews with the band, as well as with their collaborators. Watching this DVD just makes me smile.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I love this story. I have been to England three times and have ancestors that are buried over there and hope to go back find them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is an excellent game for the creative mind. It can be on survival or creative no matter I've always found fun in it and I'm 14. This game is worth the money and is a lot of fun for kids and others. I recommend this game.
B004XQO90E|4.0|I watched this movie with my wife and it felt like it was only an hour long because it kept us engrossed.<br />It compares very well with other movies of the same genre because it does not try to go typical Hollywood action flick, therefore making itself immature.  Also, the involvement of a romantic interest into the plot aids in emotional character development.<br />What I like least about this movie would be the score (but I am being picky).<br />If you like this movie, I recommend Momento or The Usual Suspects.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show just keeps getting more and more intense. I could watch it over and over, and luckily, since I was able to purchase this episode through Amazon, now I have that luxury.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I heard about this book from a woman I met at a seminar, and it sounded interesting.  I was in for a huge surprise.  This is a beautifully written, deeply moving book that traces a journey of personal growth that is human, clearly not religious, yet deeply spiritual.  The relationships that are traced in this wonderful first novel are never short-changed.  A truly lovely book, suitable for anyone who enjoys character studies, excellent writing, and intelligence.
034580404X|5.0|A good trilogy. The first is still by far the best. The second was a little slow to start but still good. The third almost as good as the first...almost.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Excellent graphics, entertaining and fun time kill. Everyone wishes it could be easier to acquire gems, I do too, but your patience will get rewarded as you near the distant levels and it makes it more challenging as well as making you decide how to spend gems and money more wisely. If given a choice, I'd exchange easily obtainable gems for quicker ways to re-up energy. You really can't do anything in the game without it and its sometimes frustrating when trying to complete tasks and competitions, but mainly the practices. All in all a great game though.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Its a really fun game the only thing that I don't like is you have to wait a really long time for everything!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very exciting, well written. Keeps going all the way to the explosive ending. And  leaves you wanting to go right to the next book.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very cute book. I enjoyed reading it fully. The only downfall is that sometimes the expressions used seemed a little off. I love it.
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Just like all star trek. we need a new star trek series. i've watched the existing ones almost enough! wow!
1616550414|5.0|Just what I hoped it would be and more. Beautiful hard back book filled with many, many Hyrule tidbits. Enjoy!
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|I am a PA fan to the end, I just wish they would end this already (no I don't, can't wait for the next one- YAY!). I enjoyed the movie and this had as much story line as all the others. I mean it is a horror movie. If you like horror, then you should like this. I don't get the negative reviewers at all - YOU CAN'T GET MAD AT THE MOVIE.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I am a big fan of John Corey, and this one was in the same context as the others.  Sometimes, the book was a little slow, but still filled with the wit.  I did like bringing Brenner into the story.  I haven't read that character yet.  I will look into it.  I believe John Corey and John Sutter were close in personalities.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|For a year & a half, this has been the one app I use the most. Make sure you choose the personalization that will help you the most. I only have it learn from SMS, because learning from gmail or facebook had some less helpful prediction results. Since I've also been using an sms/call log to gmail/calander archive app for two & a half years, the learning function has been keeping up with all the changes during that entire time and even a transfer to a new phone. The speed and keyboard layout customization are quite excellent. This is truly the one app I recommend to any new or longtime android user.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This series is so good. The characters are well developed and likable. The basic idea of a society that considers love a disease is quite creative and original. I could not put this series down! GREAT series!
B000URWYTS|4.0|I know this is a novel, but I learned so much about FLW and women's suffrage that I felt I was getting an education also. Nancy Huron does an excellent job improvising the relationship between FLW and MBB. I really fell in love with MBB, Huron made her so believable. I recommended the book to three others who are now reading it. I advised them to NOT GOOGLE the real story, it will ruin the ending.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great show!!!! Can't wait to complete the test of the seasons...its like a updated more scientific version of the X-Files
1423140605|5.0|This could quite possibly be Rick Riordan's best book so far! Join up with the seven demi-gods from the Great Prophecy and reunite with your all time favorite satyr, Coach Hedge! If you thought the other books in the series were action packed, wait until you read this! It's a very past paced novel.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|This series is creative, original, and well written! This second book does not disappoint. I could not put it down! I have been anticipating the third book which just came out yesterday...can't wait to read it! Great Series!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I like everything about this movie! It is a movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of. This is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a Calculator for your Kindle.  Does everything I need it to do, easy to use.  I didn't want anything complicated so this works perfect for me.
B004LWZWE2|1.0|We have Bonfire, backtracks, etc which all contain this stuff.  Try making some new stuff as good as you did back then or even redo some Bon Scott era songs a they were the strongest time for AC/DC as a band.<br /><br />\\"The only movie powered by AC/DC. This legendary concert film, covering a 1979 Paris concert during the Australian heavy metal band's \\"Highway To Hell\\"<br /><br />AC/DC a metal band?  Yeah right, on what planet? LOL.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|Such a fun movie and the soundtrack makes me wish I were in the south of France on a verandah drinking wine.
B0021L9MJG|5.0|one my favorite movies as a kid now on blue ray! extra sharp detail. also really cheap. a must watch for all you 80's horror movie lovers. waiting for creep show 2 blue ray!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This appears to be a good game app, several different games, I'm happy with this app so far, just started playing it today !!!!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|It's not just me who loves this game; my 3-year-old does, too, and it is by helping him build hand-eye coordination and logic. Easy and fun for everyone, this game is well worth the 99 cents!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Ever since the new update that flawlessly integrates SwiftKey Flow with the standard SwiftKey keyboard this app run beautifully. Well worth the money.
B007FY9ZWI|2.0|just nto very impressed with this app. It works but kindle should allow me to limit music like it does video separate from the app usage time.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I knew I would love this book but I didn't expect to love it as much as this. It was a rollercoaster of events that lead up to an amazing and satisfying ending. This is definitely a series that I will read again and again.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This series is amazing and so diverse, I can't seem to read them fast enough!! These are quickly becoming some of my favorite books and ones I'll read again and again!
1423101502|3.0|Great story but when will it end.<br />Percy and the Olympians really is a good read but it gets a little redundant.  When is he going to come into his power.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I thought it was a condensed version of a beautiful story. I prefer the Firth Collin version, I still think it is the best.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I discovered this late so Prime Instant Video caught me up to the current season in 1 year!  I can't wait to watch next season!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|On my god best book ever if I had 1 book out of all the books in the world I would choose this one
0439023491|5.0|Katness really is set up for the finale with the president.  Love the tension and suspense that leads to the third book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I was looking for a basic alarm clock for my HD 8.9 & am very pleased with this. Intuitive design, installed & worked with no hitches. Even show a brief weather  forecast. Highly recommend.
B000002LAC|5.0|Their voices are spectatular. I can listen to Trio over and over again.The songs are perfect and fun to try to sing along with. I love this CD
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Even for its time, this movie is an incredible drama/thrill that film makers today couldn't make any better. I love it simply because of the emotions I get when I watch it. Goldberg is my favorite in this film, because of her light humor, no one else could play it any better. That's all I have to say.
B007REV4YI|4.0|Blu Ray discs in the USA seem to be more flimsy than Australia. The package is not strong at all, but I guess it just has to hold the discs & not anything else so it's all good! The movie is GREAT! Best James Bond ever!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I upgraded to the full version which i am very happily using. Nice features and sets up and works as listed.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This book is written in first person so all of his personality comes shining right through. You can imagine him sitting in front of you telling you these stories from his tour. Justin's latest kick seems to be intimacy with this and the release if Believe Acoustic he is connecting to his fans on a whole different level. Very refreshing as most artists tend to block fans out.<br /><br />Entertaining and funny this book is a must read for any fan!<br /><br />Justin my boy thanks for taking me on this crazy journey with you!  I hope you continue to write more books about your experiences on your tour. I pray you always have happiness!!
B006DLP6JA|5.0|out performs some intels at twice the price. would recommend to others. very good and great. have bough about 3.
B001DJ7PMI|4.0|Oliver Stone leaves out important information and gets some of his facts wrong. In trying to show a conspiracy, this film takes liberties with historical information. Overall, this is an entertaining film - and nothing more.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I installed this at my son-in-law's recommendation. Works similar to MS file explorer. With the esay set up, I am fully satisfied.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I haven't been very good at working out in the past 10 years so it was time to get started again.  I was looking for something that would give me some good cardio and core exercise, but didn't take too long and that I could do at home (I have two little boys who don't make it easy to get to the gym).  I asked around on Facebook and the first 5 comments I got were to recommend this workout program, and then I had even more endorsements after that.  I've been doing this workout since last week and I can tell you I'm already feeling a difference.  The first few days my quads burned SO bad and I had a hard time going up and down stairs.  But now I can do it without too much difficulty and I can feel my endurance building.  I haven't yet added hand weights but I'm about ready to start.  Level 1 is definitely a good way to get a quick and decent workout and get back into exercising.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This is a great movie for the family and I would look to watch it in 3D.  This is a movie to own and watch
B008M4MB8K|2.0|I expected to receive the edition described with the lenticular car and the breifcase thing.  However this did not happen.  I only got the blu-rays and the art in the bluray package.  I probably wouldn't have purchased it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so much more challenging in which makes this game so fun. It had new obstacles and so much more. Just get it! It's free!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I love sad bluesy music so this was nice Must have 10 words to leave  a review makes me irritated like I don't want to if I'm forced to keep talking about a product when I am already finished!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a wonderful game. If you love horses, this is a game for you. 5 stars. Highly recommend this game for everyone.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I already play this game on FB, but I really enjoy being able to play it anywhere on my Kindle!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I did not watch Fringe when it was on television regularly, but had always thought it would be an interesting show.  I have not been disappointed - this is a very enjoyable series!  The interplay between characters, and the character castings themselves - along with writers for this show - provide good chemistry and story lines.  I highly recommend it!
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Loved Helen Hunt in this.  Not only is she HOT, but plays the character as being very believable.<br />The actor who played her client was sensational.  I would have thought he was actually severly handicapped.<br />I was surprised how funny the movie was, especially from the 'priest'.<br />This is really a 'must see' movie.
B000SEI230|1.0|I usually like Nicholas Sparks but this book was not up to his usual par. I started the book and went onto another book by another author.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. I have watched season 1 several times and will watch season 2 over and over. The complex people downstairs and up are addicting, Thomas and Mrs. O'Brien are soooo bad! Wonderful actors all. Love the English accents, could listen 24/7.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This story would make a terrific movie and I'd be the first to see it however there are so many characters that it took half the book to get them straight.  They for the most part had common names that blended together or were poorly introduced in the first place.  Parts were very sad and parts were quite funny
1451695195|5.0|An excellent, thought provoking, life changing book .A very quick read due to the interesting subject matter! makes one really think!!!!!,
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The story meanders around too much.  Great Acting though.  I could have used a little more meat..and less Mr. Pheonix
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am truly obsessed with this book.. I mean I actually have thought about it while engrossed in other books obsessed. By all means grab this book hold on tight and enjoy the emotionally exciting raw love that is hopeless. Colleen Hoover is my absolute favorite author.. After I bought hopeless I bought every other book I could from her.. And have loved them just as much!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The author does a fantastic job of taking the reader on a journey full of unexpected twists and turns.  Without exception, every person I know who has read this book has a very strong emotional reaction at the end.  Any author who has the ability to affect their readers this strongly deserves credit.
B006B7LQ90|5.0|As always you can trust Al Ries on this one. Although some of the ideas written in this book you've already knew it, it's a must for everyone who's interested in marketing.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I bought this on advice from a friend.  I've watched some of it , and like what I've seen.  When I'm done watching I'll have a better idea if it deserves 5 stars.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|So addictive what a great game can't wait to get more games like this hours of fun and so good to play
B009Z5975A|5.0|What better 3 movies to come out of the 80's and 90's. I just absolutely love that they decided to group these movies together. The picture and quality are great and so is the sound. Steven Speilberg did an awesome job on Goonies and Germlins
B007PTJOV0|5.0|super excited for an original video game i love this and so do my kids from 4yr-10yr old!! And yes it is very similar to Mario brothers
B004SBS8LA|5.0|happily played, and enjoyed by all family members - #AngryBirdsRIO is super fun on Kindle Fire, and &#34;easy enough&#34; for all :)
B005COO1X6|4.0|I was all in the story and all of a sudden it was over. What happened next? I want more.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is one of my favorite Will Ferrell movies. He definitely knows how to make me laugh. It is great for the whole family.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I started reading the book at the same time I started watching the tv series. I'm still undecided which I like better. Reading/watching simultaneously is really awesome because you can put faces to names and get background info from the book that you don't get in the show. I don't understand though why the book and show timeline needed to be different. The show time frame is a little more believable because they are older. Some of the acts and behaviors they commit seem years ahead of their time. More or less college behavior than junior high or early high school behavior. I guess that would be the only thing I really disliked about the series is how youngthey are and the acts they commit are far beyond their years. They seem awfully young to be casually drinking so often. Some of the content seems very unbelievable for a sophomore group of kids. I will definitely read the next book and continue the series on tv. It's amazing that the entire book is covered in just four tv episodes!
B007SGM084|4.0|I loved the first book. The second and third were good and made it a nice story but they don't come close to the first book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Loved it some much that I was crying on the funny parts and the sad parts. Keep making awesome books!!
B006R1T40I|5.0|Bonnie still cranks it out, great album.  If you like Bonnie Raitt you will love this, one of her best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was really good, this is my 3rd time reading it... if u love action and suspense you'll love the book  !!!!!(: (:
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Amazing show...i am addicted. I couldn't find episodes 1-10 on hulu or the CW so thank you Amazon :). I never finished a series so fast. Love that it's ad free.
B00A861QMM|2.0|I've been wanting this game for awhile but wasn't able to get it on my phone..I got it bout an hr ago and can't believe this is a G5 game at all..this game sucks!! I played the free part and when it popped up to buy I seen 99&cent; so I figured why not..lol..I didn't think it was possible to waste 99&cent; and regret it so much..lol..I guess y'all know the game sucks too if u lowered the price down that low..BUT BEWARE IF U DECIDE TO WASTE IT 99&cent; AFTER U BUY IT U GET NO MORE DIRECTIONS FOR THE MINI GAMES..figuring out what ur doing is more of a challenge than the game..lol..come on G5 give us back the good hidden object games!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great period pieces and dress.  The characters feel like family.  I love the downstairs folks.  They are all engaging with the many plots occurring in each show.  Even my husband wouldn't miss an episode.  I really liked having the CDs so we could watch whenever we chose.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Pretty cool game it is well worth the price.<br />I would recommend it to a friend.<br />Get this app.<br />I did.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It is great however the number of free puzzle are to limited.  The colors and size of the picture are acceptable.
B00ATDOVNK|1.0|I just downloaded this game and it won't open at all!! What's the deal with this?? I luv G5 games with a passion but I'm getting tired of the problems..I use to play it games all the time,to the point that there was none left forme to download on my phone,literally..so I decide to look y'all up on my kindle fire HD and just today I can't find 1 game,Shards of time {I have no idea where it is I've looked all thru my kindle yet it says that I have it,where is it} and then I download this game and it won't open after taking forever and a day to download..please help me fix these issues..I wanna play it games again..
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Let me preface my review by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Lee Child's books and I am FULLY AWARE that Reacher is supposed to be a hulking figure of a man, 6'5, 240 pounds blah blah blah and Tom Cruise isn't even 5'6 (maybe). Now for you to be put off of a movie because x doesn't look like y, then there probably are very FEW movies you actually like based off of novels because nothing is ever the exact same as they are in the book. Since the dawn of cinema...when has it?<br /><br />Anyway, the movie was really good and Cruise did a great job as Reacher. He wasn't very physically imposing of course, but he carried himself as a guy you absolutely do not want to mess with which is how Reacher comes across in the Child books. The fight scenes were well cheoreographed and made to look realistic and gritty, which worked well with the film, and the plot of the movie was translated very well from the book with some omissions which I'm sure will ruin the movie for all you close-minded perfectionists out there.<br /><br />Jack Reacher was a fun movie and as a fan of the book, I approve Cruise as Reacher and would hope to see him in the role again being that my ideal actor to play Reacher, Val Kilmer, has grown content in his direct-to-dvd movies and eating until he resembles a tub of goo. I'll be getting the movie when it comes out, it's a good addition to any action fans collection.
B000002MU3|4.0|When I bought this when it first came out I really didn't care for it but I picked it up again recently after listening to sound clips here to give it another chance. The instrumentation in a couple of the songs really sounded like some of the later INXS songs (namely King of Comedy) and I didn't care for Tongue but it's a good album nonetheless.  I will say that Stipe's vocals are somewhat muffled like in their earlier albums and this time around so are Mills' and Berry's backing vocals which is a bit disappointing because I love Mills' voice. Strange Currencies is a sensitive love song and What's the Frequency Kenneth is so much fun.  Their best album? No. But it's a good one to listen to really, really loud when you need to rock after a bad day.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This is a great game. I had it on my phone and i love it then. &#62; .. &#62; &#62;
B0012GN260|3.0|like this album, have plans for future album purchases.....not sure when but with in a year or so.  I ama bruce dickinson fan
B00AFEY354|5.0|Such an amazing movie. The actors are perfect for the characters and the story is amazing. Is a movie you can watch over and over and still find many perspectives of being an adolescent.
1451695195|1.0|Having read many books on NDE and also having studied the Bible for years, I can say this is the most ridiculous book on the subject.  None of it makes sense either medically or spiritually. I also have a medical background and what Mr. Alexander says about his supposed NDE sounds like a by-product of his coma. Notice no one mentions the absence of brain waves or that he was clinically dead.  He was obviously dreaming and I feel this book was written for monetary gains.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|Paul McCartney once advised me never to drop names...:-)...but Eric Clapton, in an interview in the March 14, 2013 issue of Rolling Stone, said this about Gary Clark: \\"I wrote him a letter saying, 'Thank you -- you make me want to play again.' \\"<br /><br />And if I had Mr. Clark's address, I would have written him something very similar.  I was on the verge of despair for the future of authentic blues; who would take over when the old masters retired and died? My worries are over.  And if you are dubious, have a serious listen to \\"Bright Lights\\" -- and if you're still not convinced, keep in mind that Clark sang most of the tracks, and played most of the instruments.  The blues will be just fine, thank you very much, indeed.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I found the book very well done on a difficult subject.  Laughed cried and could not put it down .  Definitely  would recommend.
1451696191|5.0|Is a novel every adolescent can relate some how it. So many topics dicuss it makes youn want to indulge in the novel.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Cable was delivered as promised and allowed me to set up a remote printer without a hitch.  I could not ask for more.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I can find my favority &#34;how to&#34; video's on You Tube and download them on my Kindle so I can view them at my leasure, how cool is that?
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this cool game is a totally klutz it is awsome yu guys should ttttooootttttaaaallllllllyyyy buy it my kids love it they play it every day they get back from school
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this game in play it all the time forget temple tun this is the Gamento play real talk<br />#Y.G.S.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like when Greg is in his Moms stomach I thought that was funny. But something I didn't like was Greg didn't get a girlfriend. For your next book you could do that like he could date HollyHills.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Lost Girl! You are better than all those other Paranormal shows out there, i.e. TVD, True Blood, Being Human. Keep up the good work, wanna buy season 3 as SOON as it's released on DVD! and can I say, &#34;Yeah&#34; season 4 has just been approved for filming (jumping in seat here!)
B0063IH60K|4.0|simple most well known version.  easy to play. would prefer a game with more options,perhaps even sound. will keep looking.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When a friend recomended this app 2 me I thought it would just b ok, but then I was surprised when I really liked it. It is really addicting (of course I like puzzles though). In some levels it can be really tricky, so I would not recomend this 4 littler kids. I have been using this app 4 about a week and I'm hooked. Thx for reading! : )
B0055S348W|5.0|I still can't believe how well this app works - I have a wireless Canon MP970 that is not Linux friendly - still can't print directly from Mint/Ubuntu and Google Cloud needs a Wintel box that is also a pain  to setup - yet these guys make this Android app that let's me print wirelessly from my Nexus 4 /7 with a couple of taps - scales photos on the fly and does a great job! Hey, my 7 year old can print from her tablet with this app without a problem. Onlyccomplaint is the Company doesn't  make an equivalent app for Linux....
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|It's OK but not attention grabbing like some games are. It's cute, has a cute story line and graphics. .
B00BHMF578|4.0|Until seeing this flick, never knew that such an event happened!  Always something to learn when one views a movie or other media source of an event that happened in one's lifetime!  Very impressive ... especially the credits at the end, reflecting that all 6 persons involved re-enlisted in the foreign service.  Also impressive?  Sometimes one has to go with their convictions regardless of the risks.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a sucker for stories like this, brought tears to my eyes, great book! Had me at the edge of my seat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great the graphics realistic and its so much fun! My daughter and I have a horse each because we fought over the one I had! It's child friendly and competitive! I'd recommend it to anybody especially horse lovers! =)
B008FRFN7A|2.0|would be nice if I could print and adjust the sizes on some files, but only &#34;specific&#34; things are allowed to print and even those are like 1&#34; x 1&#34;, CAN'T ADJUST! what's up with that????
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a nice simulation of the classic coin bulldozer game. If you are lucky, you can play for a while. There is a cash opton to buy more coins.  If you are patient, you get more coins for free. Leave the game and come back later and be recharged with a full set of coins.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I like the 3-D effect and the matching part of the game is challenging to find the 2nd piece. It is a good<br />time filler at the DR.'s office.
159420411X|2.0|but the interview was far more fascinating that the book. mr silver's voice varies between bored and condescending. this is an uninspired effort so dont expect to equate it with Gladwell, Levitt & Dubner, or others. as a psychologist i'm always interested and fascinated by statistical prediction, but this book fell short. i predict i wont be buying his next.
0316228532|3.0|This book has a lot of characters.  Rowling introduces them with last names, relationships, and jobs in the first few chapters. After that she just refers to them by their first names.  Here's a tip:  as you are reading the first few chapters, create a cast of characters listing each person's first and last names, who they are married to, their jobs and their kids' names.  The rest of the book, she just refers to Shirley or Samantha, and you are thinking, now who was she married to?  Perhaps not unexpectedly, the children, Fats, Arf and Krystal, have the most unique personalities and are easiest to tell apart.
B00797MB0O|1.0|I just didn't like the movie because it was boring and stupid from the beginning. This movie was a complete waste of time.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I did like the tipping the tablet to change directions but I guess I am too slow to get very far on the game.<br />It frustrated me and I deleted it.
B00AO7HN8Q|5.0|Excellent quality, great price, and you could not do any better than Iron Maiden! Had these when i was younger, great to have again.
1616202416|5.0|Purple Hibiscus is easier to read than Half of a Yellow Sun; its scope is smaller and more intimate.  But it packs just as powerful of a punch.  Loved the characters (especially the professor aunty), the story, and the setting, even though the description of abuse is  hard to read at times.  Adichie does an excellent job of showing modern day Nigeria.  Modern, yet rooted in the past; the lasting impact of colonialism's import of Christianity, the schism between city and country life, and what happens when someone from the village &#34;makes it big&#34;.  I guess there is a reason that they call her the modern day Achebe....  Read it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Enjoyed the graphics and the game.  It ia a lot of fun. I'm a horse lover so fun to play a realistic game on what we do.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Awesome movie...we need more people in the world like him!!!!! What makes this stand out is this is basically a true story. Loved it!
B002S8AGZG|5.0|Love this movie.  I didn't have any problems at all with my order and my movie even arrived earler than expected.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|I have loved the music of Jimi Hendrix since the early 70's, and being that I didn't start to appreciate him until after he died I have seen and purchased so many of these posthumous releases, starting with \\"The Cry Of Love\\" (which is still the best one).<br /> But I hate to spoil the party here but this one is nothing special at all, just another money grab. At least this time the ones grabbing the money are his estate, and not the vulture Alan Douglas who was the worst of them all. But I have a problem with the person who is running things , Jimi's step sister Janie who in reality only met Jimi shortly before he died and could not have possible known him. But as the story goes she got his father to sign it all over to her, and actually had his brother Leon (who was his blood) cut completely out of the estate.<br /> What Janie has done is try to squeeze every penny she can out of the name Jimi Hendrix and this \\"new album\\" is just further proof of that. There is really nothing special at all here and very little that is actually new, most of these songs can be found on the various posthumous releases.<br /> So I conclude that for the die hard collectors that must have everything with the Jimi Hendrix name on it will want to get this, but for those of us who already own the official releases and many of the posthumous releases, I would not recommend buying this, it is just more of the same.<br /> It pains me to give a Jimi Hendrix album 2 stars, but then again this isn't really a Jimi Hendrix album anyway, is it?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The best game Eva must get it its the best<br />Yes you are the best yes yes yes yes hoo yes
B007BFSYMS|3.0|The sounds are harsh, regardless of volume. They don't sound natural and I found them irritating.  I don't think I'll be using this one, sadly.
B0000029LG|5.0|I love Michael Jackson and I am an avid collector of MJ memorbelia.  I am so happy I found a place to buy these items tht I can actually afford.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|This is tough to rate, because I really like the movie and have watched it on DVD before purchasing this Blu-ray version. For the movie itself, I would give it 4 stars because I love Will Smith and the story is compelling. For the 3D quality of the Blu-ray disc, I am giving this review only 2 stars (and that might be generous).<br /><br />I watched the 3D version today, and realized that 99% of the movie could have been watched without glasses, because the sparse 3D effects added nothing to the film. There are so many scenes that could have capitalized on 3D effects but that were just as flat as a 2D version. It was really a disappointment. At least the set includes the 2D Blu-ray and the DVD, so I have those when I watch it again. The 3D disk is useless.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their musicality really shines through on everything they do. This album is great and I would recommend it to anyone!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have this app on my tablet and couldn't ask for anything better.  The sounds are clear and the choice of stations is great.  I have accessed a number of podcasts from favorite offerings. I don't have a lot of time during the day for radio, so this is really valuable.
B005HSL626|5.0|My husband is totally addicted since I loaded this app.  Only problem is he can't beat me yet so he won't put it down!
0393343405|4.0|I expected this book to be very dry and serious but was wonderfully surprised.  This is a good story telling with history, humor, speculations, and education, and the writing style is elegant yet light and simple.  The issues about Vatican politics, and in fact, any religious entity with power, are eventually set up for its misuse and abuse as evidenced in the world all around us.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Although I enjoy the cute dragons in this app, what I do not enjoy is what a pain it is to get anything done.<br />By the time you have made any sort of progress, the costs of habitats and growing food becomes prohibitive. One way to alleviate this is to purchase \\"gold\\" for, in my opinion, a pretty high price for a simple phone game. Eventually, I suspect most people will lose interest after a period of time due to the lack of ways to gain silver(the currency of the game). One really annoying thing is that dragons only sell for 100 silver. If the developers were to increase the sell prices of dragons, this would alleviate the bottleneck of collecting enough silver to progress. Especially since one can breed common and already owned dragons multiple times seeking to breed the rares and ultra-rares.<br />In the short term, I think most people will enjoy the game. I would not recommend purchasing the exorbitantly priced gold, simply because I think interest will be lost and the money wasted. I hope that, in the future, the developers take into consideration changing some of the game mechanics in order to prolong the app's useful life.
B000V63BN6|5.0|I was so glad to see this work come up on sale.  I couldn't wait to get it loaded to the cloud so I could play it whenever and wherever.  I want my &#34;now very adult&#34; children and grandchild to recognize genius in music.  So, this will be playing a lot.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't think I would like this series after seeing the movie but it has turned out to be one of my favorites.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u get this game u will NEVER EVER get bored of it! It is the most best game I have downloaded yet the best idea I had was to get that game! Yah it's 6.99 but once u get it u will NEVER EVER EVER regret it!! GET IT!!!!!!

B000YJ85BI|5.0|Like many of my favorite authors, John Scalzi's writing has a certain quality about it - it flows, it sings, and most of all it knows when to laugh at itself and make YOU laugh at the characters without distracting in any way from the power and intensity of the plot.<br /><br />This book is the third volume in the Old Man's War universe and does not disappoint.  If anything I find myself becoming more and more enamored with these characters as they deepen in complexity.<br /><br />As with any true science fiction worth its salt, this book explores some of the essential bits about what it is to be human by virtue of introducing a number of very decidedly non human characters, and Scalzi shows his true colors as a top shelf writer by doing so subtly and in the service of telling his intense, intrigue filled and witty story.<br /><br />I became a huge fan upon reading Old Man's War and this book has affirmed the rightness of that choice.  Highly recommended.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|you only get to play 4 scenes then it want 2.99 to buy the game. in my opinion it was not worth downloading. it took longer to download then to play the few scenes you get. I hats it when they trick you into thinking your getting a game not just a demo.
630469654X|4.0|I Like the movie and the mystique around the history... the box is not good quality, but i really want have this movie.
030745455X|4.0|Haven't finished this book yet. but so far i enjoy it immensely.  Read the first book and saw the movie, Girl with the dragon tattoo.<br />Just received the girl who kicked the hornet's nestLooking forward to reading it also.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great new season so far. Rick needs to either step up or step out, he is not being a leader, or a hero. I love that Carl is brave, he is a great character this season.
0140441166|5.0|A tad late than expected but its okay atleast I received the book rather than it being lost in the mail. Now time to read my book and enjoy
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever but it just has one problem.When you want to change your skin it tells you the request is unauthorized and the plain mincraft guy is boring.You have to go through all this downloading for the skin change and you have to her other apps. It's still a good app though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead! This is the best television show that has ever been made, I can't get enough of it!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|When I would start to draw, the game would stop all of a sudden and the background stayed black for about 30 seconds
1416955070|5.0|I read the book City of Bones. It is a page turner book about these beings called shadowhunters. The story starts off with the series heroine Clary. She and her best friend Simon go to a cub and Clary sees three teenagers kill another teenager, and that no one else saw it. Later on you find out that those teenagers are shadowhunters, humans with powers to kill demons, and Clary starts to fall for one, Jace. Soon the  reader finds out that Clary herself is no mere “mundane” a term shadowhunters use to refer to humans. She is a shadowhunter too. Her ends up being kidnapped and eventually someone betrays them and Jace does too. In the climax she finds out a villain from a long time ago is her father, and he is the one who kidnapped her mother and Jace.<br /> One main thing I found extremely surprising in this book is , not that her father is the bad guy, nor that he is the one who kidnapped her mother, not even that her mother’s best friend is a werewolf. No the biggest surprise in this book was in the middle of the climax, Clary is having a conversation with Jace and her father, Valentine. Jace actually wants to stay with his captor. That is not it though, Jace says he wants to stay because his father is there, and it was stated earlier in the book that Jace’s father is dead. Again that was not the mind blowing part. The most shocking part of this book is when Valentine breaks to Jace and Clary that he is both of their father, making them siblings. Now the entire book seemed centered around their chemistry and romance. This was just wrong. I almost gave up on the series right then and there. I didn’t though and I finished the series and find out that it was a lie and they aren’t really siblings. However, that is still wrong!!!<br />This book was extremely emotional for me. I felt for Clary when she thought she was going crazy when she saw Jace and two others kill that demon in the club, and later on when Jace pretty much stalked her. I felt for Simon whenwe find out he has feelings for Clary and walked in on her and Jace kissing. I hated Jace when he acted like a pig head towards Clary thinking he was god’s gift to mankind. I hated the traitor in the book who betrayed Jace to Valentine. I felt the passion of Clary and Jace’s strained relationship. Finally my heart broke for them when Valentine said they were siblings. This book was like an emotional roller coaster and I could not put it down for a second.<br />After the first book I had many questions. Why would the author, Cassandra Claire, make a passionate love connection between two main characters then turn them into siblings? What is going to happen to Simon? Is Clary going to end up with him now since Jace seems to be out of the question? Is Clary’s mom going to be ok?(she was found in a coma at the end). And finally, what is Valentine’s motives? Thankfully by reading the rest of the series so far all of these questions have been answered.<br />Overall this was an amazing book. I give it five stars  out of five. It was a major page turner book every second had something to keep you addicted. I cannot get enough of this series and I am now reading her prequel series, Clockwork Angel. I would defiantly recommend this book to everyone, at least anyone above the age of twelve. If you do not read this series you are missing out. I cannot wait for the major motion feature coming out in Auguast.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read all his books. A lot for suspense.I will always will read what he writes.He does not bore me.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Game was full of neat creapy graphics, awesome puzzles. The mystery was a neat twist. Recommend it, didn't take long to beat. I may try another by this company.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent read. I really love this book the way the author writes is very personal to me because I had a brain aneurysm and am still alive to let people know what happened to me. I did not have a NDE but the fact that I came back is enough! Thank You!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|EXCELLENT app! It's a must have for touchscreen keyboards. Set the typing style (precise or rapid) that best suits you. Includes customizable long-press duration, key size, etc. This app greatly helped me adjust to and become proficient in touchscreen typing. I highly recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love his writing. He told my story I was there at that time as a child., and later end up in prison camp, but still malive.
B008476HBM|4.0|Always wanted to read this book. I imagine that it would be slammed by critics today. The conversations, descriptions and rambling make reading more work than enjoyment.
B0058DRTGC|5.0|As a middle manager in an org undergoing drastic change, I found this book very helpful. It provides quick, incisive nuggets of advice, from strategy to accountability, to navigating change in org culture. If you find yourself in the midst of painful organizational change, this monograph will help you keep your eyes focused on your goals.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it it teaches you how to take care of a horse and teaches how much you half to do to keep a horse
B009NPK1IO|5.0|i love gossip girl!! this is an amazing show, very sad however that it is completely over and that this was the last season. worth buying especially if you are a blair and chuck fan!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My twins were 2 when I got the app. They still love it at 3 yrs old. It's so easy for them to do on their own. They love to pop the balloons that come across the screen when they complete a puzzle.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great action/science fiction movie. It is well worth the price and the wait to receive it. Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachery Quinto as Spock, make up an exciting team, but then, so do the other characters: Uhura, Sulu, Chekov, Scotty, and Captain Pike. I am waiting for the sequel to come out so that I can pre-order it!!<br /><br />There are also some great similarities to Star Gate and Star Wars, but on it's own, it would still be a great pick for me.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This movie was funny. I did have a few things in the movie that were more adult to me. Not sure what age group they are targeting, but anyway it was still a good movie. Most of the movies are too provocative for kids in my opinion. Why does cartoons/animated movies have sexual content in it?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome!!soooooo fun I need help putting it down love it so much I can play it over and over again!!!
B0091WAWTM|2.0|The description sounded interesting and it was reviewed highly so thought I would give it a try, alas not to my taste.<br />The young lady dancing seemed to me to have little to do with the plot so decided to opt out of the rest of the movie.<br />Perhaps if I had continued through to the end my rating could have been higher.
1451648537|5.0|Very interesting book. It was easy to read and very informative.  i would recommend it to anyone.  It gives a great insight into the apple products
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read this for book club and did enjoy it.  It kept me reading and I finished it in a few days.  It was a little vulgar and lots of bad language at times, but I enjoyed the story.
B004YXE438|5.0|I play this game a lot. Its as easy or challenging as you choose and the pictures are colorful and fun. I highly recommend this app.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Overall thought it was written, directed and acted very well. Will be watching further episodes.<br />Segal and Perlman shine brightly.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome game. I never had any trouble with it. It's awesome and can't wait for the second one. Great story and beautiful graphics. I would recommend this game to anyone and the type of game you could play over and over again. Just great! I play it on my kindle fire hd and its awesome.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a very well-written, well-constructed novel. Admittedly, the characters do not act like your typical teenagers. However, I can't understand why that is pointed out repeatedly in bad reviews of the book.  Isn't that the point? - these are not typical teenagers facing typical teen angst.  These are teens dealing with an infathomable situation.  And while heart-wrenching, Mr. Green manages to write about it with humor and grace. Definitely worth reading.
0316069434|1.0|I have never read a full Bosch novel: in print they appear quite dull. But I have listened to almost all of the audio book versions of the Bosch series. Dick Hill is one of our finest narrators and has also done several books in the Wallander series by Henning Mankell. 'The Black Box' suffers from not being read by Hill, but by a Michael-something. He is not terrible, but damn, how I missed Hill's sublime narration.<br /><br />I waited two months in line to download TBB from my library system, but it was not worth the wait. The story actually starts out very promising, with a prologue set during the 1992 L.A. riots, but gets thinner and thinner until the lame, lazy, Hollywood style wrap up. I saw much of the turn of events coming a mile down the road, the characters were 2D, not 3D, motives are too cliched, etc. etc.<br /><br />Worst of all: The 1992 homicide victim herself, Danish freelance journalist Jespersen, never comes fully \\"alive\\" in the story: she doesn't haunt us in the way she should in a tale such as this.<br /><br />Bosch is now 60 as far as I understand: perhaps it's time to retire?  Mankell has retired Wallander, and wisely so.<br /><br />My favorite Bosch novel: The Last Coyote, read by Dick Hill.<br /><br />NOTE: As far as I understand, Connelly makes a math error in calculating Bosch's daughter's age. At the end of 'Lost Light' published in April 2003 we learn that Bosch has a daughter; in Vegas his ex-wife Eleanor Wish tells him the child is almost four years old which means she was born circa 1999. In 'The Black Box', published in November 2012 (last year) Maddie Bosch is sixteen which means she was born circa 1996.
B001EBWING|5.0|Great movie but, the movie kept pausing to buffer so like I said great movie but the connection was horrible and took me forever to get amazon to let me buy it!!
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love this movie and it is fantastic that I can get it at such a great price!  I'm also glad it's the Three-Disc combo. That way I can watch it anywhere!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The actors/actresses are marvelous - love Dame Maggie Smith already, but she is a classic in this series.  Keep up the good work Brits!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Okay, so I have read all the books...I'll review the contents of this blu-ray set. It has the blu-ray format, dvd format and coupon code for a digital download. I got it all for 30 bucks! Fantastic deal. The blu-ray quality is fantastic. I have season 1 on itunes HD and it doesn't compare to the crispness of the blu-ray transfer. Unfortunately I didn't get the digital copy insert. Not a problem, I emailed HBO digital copy support and I got a new code the next day. All I did was send them a copy of my invoice.<br /><br />As far as season 2, I was very annoyed with the changes made to Daenerys. Some of the changes were flat out stupid. Everything else was OK. I'm looking forward to Season 3!
B005JABSB6|5.0|good battery time. glasses are not that heavy. but wished frames were wider like aviator as frame limits vision. but still these glasses offer wider view over rivals.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game was entertaining and I can't wait for the sequel. Great graphics also. I would like to see a sneak peek now
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because I love to earn money and this one is perfect for me.It is good for kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I actually saved the last 2 hour special ending of Downton Abbey for an extra day because I couldn't bear to see the last of these fabulous characters I've grown to love.  Seeing the differences in the classes of servants vs the upper class was an amazing experience.  We Americans can't begin to understand the tight lines that were drawn between the classes and other than we might think it wasn't fair, but after watching Downton Abbey, I've since changed my mind.  Lord Grantham is a compassionate and caring employers, even paying their hospital bills and giving them a place to stay when they retire.<br /><br />Sure, Lord Grantham owns a castle-like home along with hundreds of acres and the village.  He, along with his ancestors for hundreds of years, have had the responsibility of the lives of the farmers and all of the people depending on Lord Grantham to do what's right in order to continue their almost idyllic existence.  Today we choose our own jobs and take care of ourselves, but many of us slip through the cracks.<br /><br />In the world of Downton Abbey, those willing to work are well taken care of, though one of the servants chooses to step out of the narrow lines of propriety and pays the price of losing her job, and then having to take up the lowest form of work with no hope of ever escaping her fate.<br /><br />The story of the Crawley's continues along with the story of the servants downstairs in season 3.  What's amazing about this series is how well-drawn and realistic the characters are.  There are no card-board cut-outs, these people have real problems that are not glazed over in the least.  I found the lives of the servants as compelling, if not more so at times, than the upper class who they served.  I was also amazed at the respect the family shows for their servants, asking about their lives and helping them in times of troubles.<br /><br />Watching Downton Abbey is a pleasure you don't have to feel guilty about because you're learning so much about a period of time that might be too dry to read about history books.  Julian Fellowes brings to life a period of time that started to crumble with WWI, when the servants who went to war, along side the Lords, brought down the barriers that stood for so long in English society.<br /><br />I won't give away of the wonderful plot points, other than to say that season 3 does not disappoint.  And that being allowed to see the inside of a Scottish castle, and Downton Abbey was a treat and worth watching the show even if the writing weren't so first class.out a period of time that might be too dry to read about history books.

B0095XPZBC|5.0|What can I say?  If you are a Trekkie (Trekker?) you should love seeing any episodes in blu-ray.  There are some very good episodes in Season 2--&#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; being one of the best of the entire series.  However, it feels like this set was put together a little more hastily than the Season 1 set.  There are a few shots were the film quality is somewhat bad, and these really stand out if you're paying close attention.  But overall, it's the best Jean-Luc and crew have ever looked.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie. Very suspenseful had me on the edge of my seat. Suprised to know this was done my our Govt.
B006H5120E|5.0|We loved the 3D version of the Titanic.  We had seen the original Titanic, but the 3D version really enhanced the movie.  I am glad the made the purchase as it is an excellent movie.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is the best series that I have seen in a very long time.  I missed it when it was broadcasted on PBS but I won't miss it when it returns for season 4.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Very challenging,decent graphics, would like better hints. Looking forward to sequel and other games like thus one. Would recommend for someone who likes challenges.
B000002MZ9|1.0|First of all, I really do like the music. The only reason I am giving this CD a low rating is because the quality of sound in the way it was recorded. It basically sounds like s*** where did the recording they absolutely did something wrong. The whole album has a fuzzy sound to what and the vocals. You could hardly hear but yet when I went on iTunes and purchased certain songs from this album and downloaded them to my library and then burn the songs to a CD everything came out great. Like I said, I really like songs that Neil Young done on this album, but whoever recorded this album did not know what they were doing. Thank you Charlie
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Usually don't get lured into cheesy romance novels but the characters were realistic....you know someone like one of those characters in your life....
1582406723|5.0|it was shipped quick and was great. way faster moving than the show, but just as good in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game, relaxing, fun, and also teaches you stuff. If you enjoy horses then you must download, I highly recommend.
0525953728|5.0|Since my first born declared intent to pursue this line of work I have wanted to understand more.  This is definitely a book I would encourage any teen with military aspirations to read.  And while I have my parental concerns, Owen's integrity and honor radiates.  You've got to be proud of these guys.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It gave great detail and it helped me understand more of the book(s) and it was a great ending to a great sequel
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that Subway Suffer is and was extremely fun to play and to talk about. It also had some problems.
B00BHMF578|4.0|All around good movie—though inaccurate and self-serving to all americans. But hey, that's entertainment! Really enjoyed the pace of this film and seriously, it is a good flick. Not sure if I would have given it the Oscar, though
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Love this movie! Especially on blu-ray, looks fantastic! Both part 1 & 2 are great adaptions of Frank Miller's graphic novels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I thought this would be an average missing person novel, but Ms. Flynn takes you on a ride that is so full of twists and turns, you won't know which way is up. Just when you begin to hate certain characters, the script gets flipped and you can't get off the emotional roller coaster, even when you really want to. The end will have you shaking your head in disbelief until you realize how perfect it truly is.
B000FJGWBC|5.0|love the movie, the all thing, was funny has a lot of acctions and it is in the ocean what else.
0525423273|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I know it's a young adult, but I think it suits all ages readers.<br />It's a cute story, as lovely as Paris. And it's so funny when they compare american and french cultures.<br />And about St. Clair! OMG! His british accents took my breath away.<br /><br />If you want a dense, complicated story, this is not the book you are looking for.<br />This is the opposite! It's a light, amazing, passionate and cute teen love story.<br /><br />I do recommend it.<br />(Sorry, I'm brazilian, love reading english books, but my writing it's not the best in the world hahaha)
B002G1YPH0|3.0|The thing is big. I used some thermal grease with higher thermal transfer then the gunk included. My temps at idle are at around 41degC. Seems high. I didn't bench mark the stock cooler so I can't say if its better or not. I probably should have spent more on a better cooler but I was being cheap and didn't want to drop 60 bucks at the time. And really this should be adequate. We will see once I put some real load on the proc if it holds up.  Also I installed this on a I5-3570K. on a ASrock Pro3 MB it fit fine but the thing is horribly tall. It fits in my Cooler Master 690 case no modifications needed but this is a pretty wide case. So if you have a slimmer tower forget it unless you are ok with hacking into your case.<br />You will need to remove the fan from the HS if you intend to install the unit without it already being mounted to the MB prior to putting it in the case.<br /><br />One thing I would like to complain about is the fact that this HS only comes with one fan.  the primary picture for this product shows it with 2 fans installed. I opted for this one over another because I thought it included 2 fans. But this was not the case, only one is included. This is not mentioned even thought there are multiple pictures in the product description that show the unit with 2 fans. No where obvious does it state that the 2nd fan that is shown is only optional and not included.  As I was anxious to get my build I just sucked it up and installed it anyway.
B002APU580|5.0|I love love love this movie. This is a great adaptation of Pride and Prejudice!I could watch this over and over and over again. LOVE!
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run is a book that everybody should read, great story, funny, and will inspired you to be a better person with others and yourself.  To me was easy I love running, I can say that I was born to run.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I have read the instructions, gone online and seen the tutorials on YouTube and the fact remains; this product does not work!!
0062101897|5.0|Good for any fan to get a little more information. Its a coffee table book that never fails to get a comment when I have people over.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|In my estimation, Criminal Minds is by far the best &#34;crime&#34; TV series ever. I love the interaction of the characters, the stories are chillingly well done, and there's no rehashing of the same crime over and over again. Just don't watch it if you're alone and afraid of things that go bump in the night!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always....Great reading..I was a little slow at first putting all the pieces together..but the Mr Grisham wrapped it up quiet nicely..All of his books are very good...
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Little less visuals on the sex would be great though. My daughter read this and I was embarrassed to know she read it.
8866131105|5.0|I buy this planner every year. I think this is my fourth one. I use it daily. I even keep notes of the weather because at the bottom of every page there are two line  dedicated to weather.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would like this.  I love it.  Watched 29 episodes 1n 10 days.  Don't want it to end.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game but get frustrated by the amount of coins needed to buy new habitats or expand your territory vs the time it takes to earn coins.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|A recreation of an historical event that had me gripping my seat even though I already knew the outcome.  It also recaptures the feeling of the late '70s - 1980 which I lived through, and I am amazed at how much the world has changed (secretaries using IBM Selectric typewriters in the CIA?).  The acting was very good.  Also, I was very curious as to where they filmed the movie (look it up - you'd be surprised) because I'm sure the Iranians would have nothing to do with it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator, easy to use and I love the history feature option, best idea yet, for paperless history:)) This app will be my go to app for all my math needs:))
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great story points, but i cant help but feel the story drags on a bit, especially near the end.  Still a good story even if some deux-ex machina is introduced.
B000S88JTS|5.0|When this movie came out I had a Husqvarna dealership. Sales took off to the point we could not keep them in stock and Husky could not furnish them fast enough. It really pumped up the entire off road market.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|It' just a great movie. I received it on time and it was in great shape. Still watching over the years.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked this book until he began to talk like a doctor.  That was where I skipped pages until I found the storyline again.  It was interesting, and informative.  I work in the medical field and know how most doctors react to patients who describe NDEs.  It was refreshing to read about an MD trying to persuade  colleagues  that there is life after death. The author did a good job describing his excursion into the afterlife.  At times he tried so hard to convince that the science got in the way.  He talked sincere but am wondering  if he could let go and just 'believe'.  I will probably read it again.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Was told about this thru a friend. Love  it. Can't  live without it. Always new things to view.  I've already tried some of the recipes and made a few craft items. Interesting information for everyone.
B00A83075M|3.0|I bought it cause of my kids and I too thought it would be a really good movie but it a three star movie and kids under 3 will get bord with it about 1/3 of the way to half way into the movie. Other then that its not bad.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across this book while reading a list if &#34;Best new works of science fiction 2012&#34; list on some website and decided to give it a go. Wow, I am so glad that I did. With wonderfully interesting characters and a deep rich world this book/series has all of the marks of a SciFi classic. Expect this to join the ranks of 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451 and The Giver as a brilliant dystopian novel.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I actually decided to read this because I really enjoyed the movie. And I know there were variations but it didn't really matter. As someone who suffers from depression, I felt as if this was the first thing I've read that has really described how it is to be mentally it'll. It's true and beautiful and I that the author for writing something I could really relate to.
B003VS0CWY|3.0|As most people know, Sound of Music is a great movie and has no need to review it further. I bought the film in blu-ray for my new blu-ray player. It would have been my 3rd blu-ray movie. Unfortunately, the main blu-ray disc did not play. The other two discs, the special features blu-ray and the regular DVD version worked just fine. My other blu-ray movies also played just fine so I figured it was this disc.I had to return it.
B00AS1Q93S|2.0|I Pre-orded this movie cause of the dates it gave when it was to come out and now its saying it will be in early May when they send it out. I bought it cause it looks like a good movie and because I love action movies.The low Star count is cause of the misinformating of the dates and how long I have to wait on it. I may change this later. So, watch when you pre-order for a movie guys.

0312106122|4.0|The first chapter of River God left me wondering why my daughter in law recommended it to me. The early descriptions of castration and detailed descriptions of the body of a young girl made me wonder what I was getting into. After having completed the book, and it does get one hooked to continue reading, action was really the major part of the book. It reminded me an X-rated James Michener or Taylor Caldwell. The story takes place in Egypt around 1800 BC. The main character and narrator, is a eunuch. The other principle characters are a young girl who will be queen and a warrior who becomes her love.<br />The story is filled with action and intrigue and is overall very interesting reading. It includes the life style, inventions and daily life of that time period, right down to the toilet habits and politics. It is a long book, but is quick to read. It really is well researched and well written. I recommend River God to those who do not find raw descriptions of that time and place to be a problem.

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I love this movie and I'm so glad to have it. However, it was listed as the original film and instead it is definitely a boot-legged copy of it. I thought I was buying a used DVD but it came to me with a makeshift case with misspellings, strange pictures, and looked printed from a home printer. Also, the DVD itself jumps right to a menu screen with few options- meaning there were no previews, nothing to state that the producers weren't held liable to commentary... and I'm pretty sure there is no commentary option. In short... this is not an official seller.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It would have been nice to know it was a trial before I wasted my time.  Graphics are good, gameplay is straightforward.  Huge, slow download after the  app installs, before first play.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie is enticing, exciting, and leaves you wanting more. It is an amazing movie with that is truly inspiring. I would recommend it to anyone 10 and up, as there is strong language at many times in the movie. The movie analyzes and changes completely the views we have of teenagers and stereotypes.

B0060MYM3S|1.0|9.5 hours of boring dialogue by so many different people, with so many sub plots. It makes it hard to care what happens to any of them. And if killing babies is okay, then why are all of these evil people still alive after a complete season? Bought season one and two, will not buy season three.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I heard &#34;Next to Me&#34; on the radio and instantly fell in love with it. I didn't think I could like any other song on the album as much as I loved &#34;Next to Me,&#34; but every day I find a different song that speaks to me and gets stuck in my head. This album has great upbeat tracks like &#34;Heaven,&#34; &#34;Daddy,&#34; and &#34;Wonder,&#34; as well as slow and powerful songs like &#34;Suitcase,&#34; &#34;Clown,&#34; and &#34;My Kind of Love.&#34; She is an amazing singer and lyricist.

B00AA0TZTW|5.0|During the couple of years of his life,Jimi Hendrix invested an enormous amount of time making new music with a number of different people (famous and otherwise) at his Electric Ladyland Studio's. Since music remained such an enormous part of the cultural consciousness,the wealth of often dubious Jimi Hendrix music released in the years following his death was highly welcomed. Even outside his most obvious influence within the psychedelic music framework,Jimi Hendrix was instrumental,both literally and figuratively,in expanding the language of rock n roll from being a relatively simple form into something far more expansive. And the best part is that his most famous music recorded with the Experience only hinted at this. During his whirlwind year of recording at Electric Lady,Jimi Hendrix mad a concerted effort to musically reconnect himself his African American roots. And that is primarily what this album represents.<br /><br />  \\"Earth Blues\\" was the theme song for the motion picture [[ASIN:B00004Y7ER Rainbow Bridge]]. This is a far far better take of the song than the fuzzy version heard at the start of the movie and is an excellent piece of rocking,bluesy funk that is not only one of my favorite latter day Hendrix tunes but also an important milestone for him moving in a new direction. On \\"Somewhere\\",\\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\",\\"Bleeding Hear\\" and \\"Mojo Man\\" he delves even further into that sound,presenting a mix of his classic amped up bluesy lead solos and his funky rhythmic style which all come together to represent some of the finest and fluid guitar playing of his sadly short musical career. \\"Let Me Move You\\" and \\"Inside Out\\" feature the vocals of Lonnie Youngblood along with rapid fire,guitar like horn patterns illustrating his own take on rock n soul take on his sound-with much cleaner playing more in keeping with his years on the R&B circuit by way of his psychedelic sound. That hybrid is explored on much fuller songs such as the grooving \\"Izabella\\" and the jazzy shuffle of \\"Easy Blues\\".<br /><br />  While \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" and Villanova Junction Blues\\" go more for the hard blues/rock sound associated with the rockier side of his Band Of Gypsies period,this album represents Hendrix probably best in terms of his re-imagining of rock n roll as the funk era of the late 60's into the 70's really started to sink in. And I have noticed that,by degrees,each of the more recent posthumous Hendrix releases have tended to delve very deeply into that transition. While Jimi Hendrix will always probably be known rightfully as one of the major innovators of psychedelic rock-innovating a number of important guitar techniques along the way it's important to know that it was primarily blues,soul and funk that was actually at the base core of just about everything he did and played. And because he is such a revered and respected musical talent,with the musicians he influenced now having the same effect on younger players as he did,releases such as this are extremely vital and important.jazzy shuffle of \\"Easy Blues\\".<br /><br />  While \\"Hey Gypsy Boy\\" and Villanova Junction Blues\\" go more for the hard blues/rock sound associated with the rockier side of his Band Of Gypsies period,this album represents Hendrix probably best in terms of his re-imagining of rock n roll as the funk era of the late 60's into the 70's really started to sink in.

B00908DDZM|5.0|Mackelmore is extremely talented. I enjoy rap music, but his lyrics are far beyond what you hear on the radio these days. The entire album is awesome. Even when I wasn't feeling a song at the beginning I was jamming to it by the end. This is an album you can listen to over and over for years to come.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This is an album that swept me away upon first listen.  Amazing depth and vision.  If you like &#34;Astral Weeks&#34; by Van Morrison, you must buy this album.  It's on the same wavelength and level of mastery.  Genius.

B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Without realizing it the music of Boz Scaggs has been a great deal more significant to how I view music than I believed it to be. It was not simply a matter of growing up listening to his hits. Somehow,with each new sub-genre of soul and rhythm & blues I explore,seems Boz is always somehow a part of that equation. His vocal style is very unique. His phrasing and tone is so strong and pitch perfect that he can interpret music through the entire spectrum of the soul/R&B musical world. He once spoke of his late 70's breakthrough as his reflection not of a retro sound but what was contemporary in soul and R&B at that time. He explored this vision up into the early 90's,until later in the decade he started to deal with more retro blues styles. While the blues has always been a part of his sound,what of the music that was contemporary during his breakthrough in the 70's? Well with the help of musicians such as bassist Willie Weeks and fellow guitarist Ray Parker Jr.,that is what he does on this album.<br /><br />  Sadly I don't know all of these songs but \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" typifies the basic approach of this album-elegantly produced and arranged funky mid 70's style Memphis soul with that quiet fire that defined that area and that era of soul music. \\"So Good To Be Here\\" almost spookily channels it's origins in Al Green and,as a result,is one of my favorites here thanks to it's sheer funkiness. \\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\" finds Scaggs lowering into his deeper vocal register for a very telling and often tortured vocal delivery-perfect for the Brook Benton classic. Steely Dan's \\"Pearl Of A Quarter\\" really gets the deeper southern funk treatment here,far removed from their jazzier take but a superb interpretation as it reinvents the song rhythmically. \\"Corrina Corrina\\" finds Boz,again in lower register,on a stark acoustic folk/soul take just him on guitar. And though 'Cadillac Walk\\",\\"Dry Spell\\" and \\"You Got Me Cryin'\\" are a bit mildly cliched blues for my taste,the dynamic take on the ballad \\"Sunny Gone\\" returns back to what this album does best.<br /><br />  So yes this album is very much retro,at least in this time period. And yes it is an interpretive collection. But there are many things that add up to it being one of Boz's strongest releases. For one,with time and age his vocal instrument is every bit as full and strong as it ever was. Not only that but not ever song here owes it's interpretation solely to the original. Some of these songs were very raw in their original versions. The production from Steve Jordan has a very uniform sound as if they were all meant to be on the same album together. On the other hand,the variety of material presented gives Boz plenty of opportunity to be instrumentally and vocally creative with it as well. It's probably the perfect album for Boz Scaggs to be making as he,with all due honesty,enters into his twilight years as a recording artist. While those years could easily reflect decades for someone of his already strong longevity,I can only hope with five years separating this from his previous album,that there will be yet more sweet soul music of many shades to come from Mr. Bozz Scaggs.n the ballad \\"Sunny Gone\\" returns back to what this album does best.<br /><br />  So yes this album is very much retro,at least in this time period.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|To put it simple... this is an excellent dialog-driven story.  If you can't watch a movie or television show that doesn't two or three murders and several car crashes mixed in with a few zombies to go, well then Downton Abbey may not be your kind of tea.  On the other hand, if you like well thought out plot lines and costumes from a few generations past, Downton Abby should shiver your timbers.

B005WUHAX8|2.0|I was very excited when I ordered this case, but ended up very disappointed! There were so many things I disliked about it I do t know where to start. The clear plastic front cover never was against the phone, so you have to push hard instead of touch the screen! The waterproofing on all the speakers made it almost impossible to hear through. I ended up giving it away after about a month of struggling with it! It seemed poorly designed to me. Maybe it's just mem but I'm certainly not a fan! I would not recommend this case!

055357342X|3.0|Perhaps the writer's background in television explains the nature of this series.  The rule in television is that --as long as the ratings are high enough-- the show must go on, no matter what the writers have to do to keep it going.  Thus there are no real character arcs in television, and no teleology, as it were, no consummation.  As in television, Martin's characters are sharply drawn, and the earlier stories have some punch, but then it just goes on and on, with the characters following no arcs, per se, and the series approaching no meaningful resolution.  And, while the stories are often entertaining, and the writing often sharp (some of Tyrion's asides are laugh-out-loud funny) there are no deeper themes here, really.  JRR Tolkien, he is not.

Indeed, can anyone, anymore, even take seriously this character or the series' premise?  Watch Zero Dark Thirty instead to see how real people gather intelligence and battle the bad guys.  A much better-made and more thrilling film, besides --and that's even with knowing beforehand how the story turns out!

B003ASLJQS|5.0|My bargain-rack movie for last night was the \\"Mystic River\\" DVD starring Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Baker and directed by Clint Eastwood. It was an excellent movie, without question. I'm an old-line, long-term Clint Eastwood fan and I found this movie to be amazing. It was so far removed from Eastwood's early \\"Man With No Name\\" and \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies as to be almost unrecognizable. Here, Eastwood not only directed the film but he is even credited for the music. His professional growth over his long career has been astounding.<br /><br />In this  film, three Boston-aea boyhood friends experience tragedy in a variety of stunningly different ways resulting in the death and probable imprisonment of two. It's a stirring long-term story and exceptionally well done. The movie is a tense police drama that is totally unlike Eastwood's early police work in the form of Dirty Harry. Here, the police  race to solve a very unfortunate murder mystery, before a small vigilante committee takes matters into their own hands. The police fail, by a narrow margin. The  results are deeply tragic in every way, and yield a crushing emotional ending to a superb movie. It's not a comfortable movie to watch, I might add.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is good. The acting is excellent. The filming is first rate. The musical background is excellent. The story is gripping. The emotional impact is stunning. Good movie! Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B00AA0TZTW|4.0|As an avid music fan, after buying many CD's and reading umpteen reviews on Amazon, this is my first official post.  I have to just weigh in with all the BS regarding this release.  All I can say is \\"Simmer down Francis!\\"<br /><br />Wow, a lot of negative reviews for something that is a collection of material that was recorded over 40 years ago - of course it is not new - regardless of what the EXP Hendrix/major label machine says!  Anyone in the know (who boastfully throws their weight around in these reviews as an EXPert), should be savvy enough to look past that moniker and enjoy the music.<br /><br />I have close to 80 of Jimi's \\"releases\\" and agree that none of this is new, as a matter of fact most of these songs have seen the light of day numerous times - as recently as Valleys of Neptune.  However, if you lighten up and let the creative force flow over you, you will find this is a well done collection of rare-pieced-together-outtakes (free of the Douglas-era overdubs!) and studio jams that serve as a fresh look into the creative genius and guitar wizard that was Jimi.<br /><br />So why don't we lighten up and just enjoy the music for what it is worth - take a step back and realize that in 2013 there is not much new material that can touch this release.  I mean you can still hear the sweat hit the floor during Mojo Man or Let Me Move You's righteous funk.  And for the (6th at least) time I am hearing a studio cut of Hear My Train.....this one is one of the best that gave me goose bumps when I heard it last week.<br /><br />Chill out and stop the 1-2 star reviews - that should be saved for the material that deserves it .  PH & A is not a bad trip at all!

B00AU15HPC|5.0|What a treat! Justin just keeps creating great music. His voice is as beautiful as ever. If anything, it has improved with age, becoming more complex and interesting (like a fine vintage wine). His guitar playing continues to impress and he is one of the most prolific and poetic writers of all time. This album, like most of his songs, requires multiple listens. It is deceptively simple sounding, but each listen reveals more intricate details. Don't judge it after one or two listens; it deserves more attention to be truly appreciated. Some of the early reviews were written too soon! This is one of the main things I've always liked about the Moody Blues. Their music continues to sound better with each listen. While I've never been a fan of country or blue grass, the three tracks in this style are growing on me. Justin just might make a country fan out of me! I'm not a techno fan either, so the remixes of \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\" at first seemed out of place to me, especially since it's such a great song in its original form. But after reading Justin's explanation of why they were included (in an interview), it brought a smile to my face and I now understand their inclusion. For anyone who downloaded the album and is annoyed by the gap between tracks 13 & 14, I was able to merge them without a gap as follows: First, track 13 (\\"Rising\\") must be trimmed because it has about 2 seconds of silence at the end. If you don't do this, the \\"gapless\\" merge will still have a 2 second gap. Then, put tracks 13 (trimmed) & 14 in a playlist and burn a gapless audio CD of the two. Highlight both tracks and choose \\"merge\\" from the Options menu. Finally, import them into iTunes and you're good to go! One more thing; why would this album be put in the genre \\"Spoken Word\\" when every word is sung beautifully by Justin? While this may be a tribute to Justin as a great poet, the fact remains that he is singing, not speaking!<br />Justin, thank you for many decades of listening pleasure.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I had no idea what this book was about. I bought it because it was well reviewed and cheap. Turned out to be quite unique, a book about a man marooned on mars and his survival along with a massive rescue effort. There are several suspenseful moments that I thought were well done, and I am impressed at the depth of the story. The premise is plausible. The author does like to describe in detail the math the main character uses to solve countless dilemmas.  That got a bit old here and there. Overall a good, really good read.

B004R13U6Y|3.0|I got it on Google app store. I got it on for the text/pdf to speech functionality, rather than just a pdf reader.<br />The features are great (for example, in the right setting, the spoken text is highlighted so you can read along as you listen), but don't work consistently. It is, at times, very slow to load and the user interface is not always intuitive. It would also be nice to have an auto shut off timer (sleep feature).<br /><br />My biggest complaint would be that it freezes and sometime very very slow to load if at all.<br />On the other hand, I had moon+ reader pro which, as far as text/pdf to speech functionality go, has less options and is as buggy.<br /><br />So, overall if the application would not keep freezing I would rate this as 4+, and if than the user interface was a little more intuitive, I would rate it as 5-.<br />As it is right now, I would rate it as 3-4 mainly due to the freezing. I am recommending it since at this time I am not aware of a better pdf to speech app and believe/hope that with a few updates it will improve significantly.

Some will put down the work of a sniper, but like Chris said, his real job is to watch over his brother soldiers from his vantage point as they execute their mission. In war there are no silly man-o-man rules, it is kill or be killed and I thank the late Chris Kyle for a job well done.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought a Lifeproof case and then I bought this. A piece fell out when I opened it, a few weeks later the hinge on the bottom broke off and now more pieces are falling off. This case is definitely not waterproof and definitely not lifeproof, however it does work and it protects the case well from pretty much everything but water.<br /><br />Lifeproof is better quality but I wouldn't waste your money on them either...the cover over the camera hole broke off on mine after just a few months of use. Not worth the 80$. Buy an Otterbox.

0765325950|5.0|Yeah, I read the first book The Eye of the World WHEN IT CAME OUT.  And boy have I waited around for the final battle.  With a change of authors one might think the story would suffer and it did, but it also gained.  Sanderson does not tell the story like Jordan at all, but he has a unique voice that is very good.  And because he is working with Jordan's model, outline and world, he does a good job of making me forget that he isn't Jordan from time to time.  I love The Way of Kings by Sanderson, so I'm not knocking his story telling style or prose at all, but Jordan is a master of this universe he has created and despite endless discussions by nearly pointless characters through the last five of Jordan's books, I maintained my love of The Wheel.  How could I not?  This is the best fantasy world ever created.  Not Tolkien, not Erickson, not any of the others has anything even close.  We've all read farm boy saves the world fantasy, I don't care because this is the book that started them all.  I've read The Eye of the World about 7 times and it is just as good every time.  A great beginning and one that will carry most readers to the end with ease.  So the next 13 or so books were easy.<br /><br />And, I must say, the wait for A Memory of Light was worth it.  I thought this was far above average in terms of rounding out the story, finishing character arcs, not losing track of story threads and delivering action at an almost non stop pace.  Matt, my favorite, has been neglected a bit by Sanderson but he has explored some other characters (those he seems to be interested in) very well, so much so, that I found myself becoming fond of a few though I did not care for them at all before I started the book.<br /><br />I think Sanderson really opened up some of the myth and legend of The Wheel in this book.  He has a real eye for what must be rote detail and what can be intrinsically fascinating.  I'm trusting someone will be writing ten more books in this world.<br /><br />Top notch book here.  Don't let my criticism deter you, I gave it 5 of 5 stars for a reason.  It's great.Top notch book here.  Don't let my criticism deter you, I gave it 5 of 5 stars for a reason.  It's great.

B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I've been pretty hard on the Estates handling of JImi's music but this release isn't all that bad.It is a cut and paste job and early try outs of songs but it is Jimi,warts and all. Lets face it Jimi would have never sanctioned this release but guys, if this is all there is studio wise then its better that nothing. The average fan only knows Jimi by his first 3 releases. Lets face it, how much radio play does BOG and the other releases get? Answer: None. I give it three stars because it is an interesting listen. Now, EH, lets get to the video stuff that has been held up for years. Atlanta Pop, Stockholm,Miami Pop, RAH, etc.
B009A87ZKG|4.0|I already own the 40th-Anniversary Blu-Ray Book version of this film. That packaging used the 2008 digital remastering of the film, a remastering that seemed OK...until compared to this 2012 BD version, which I went ahead and purchased after reading glowing reviews of this latest remastering at amazon and elsewhere.<br /><br />As others have noted, this 2012 version is far superior to the 2008 version. There's just so much more detail, contrast and depth to this version that it's hard to believe I could have felt satisfied with the 2008 issue. Visually, this is a stunner, and well worth the $10-20 price point it is often sold at by amazon. The packaging also includes the DVD version.<br /><br />The soundtrack, however, leaves much to be desired. There's lots of distortion in the sound, and not just in the battle scenes where explosions and the noises of tanks and trucks seem boosted above the normal playback level. The distortion also afflicts the dialogue in many places. Sadly, this is another case of a studio spending money to greatly improve picture quality while doing nothing to improve the sound. One would think that in this age of digital editing and restoration that an effort would be made to get the soundtrack into a condition that matches the visual element. I guess not.<br /><br />I have one more complaint, and that's with the subtitles that appear whenever the Germans are speaking: they're positioned over the film image and are very difficult to read at times as they're set in white at a very small point size, often against a very light background. I assume the subtitles are in the film negative and have always appeared this way. But with modern digital technology, those subtitles could be removed from the picture and placed below the screen in the black area that sits at the bottom of any HDTV when playing back a widescreen movie. Again, there would be some expense involved, but as there are relatively few subtitles in the movie, it couldn't be that big of an expense.<br /><br />The visual element of this film deserves a 5-star rating, but the problems noted above knock this version's overall rating down to 4 stars.of an expense.<br /><br />The visual element of this film deserves a 5-star rating, but the problems noted above knock this version's overall rating down to 4 stars.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a poignant, funny, sad, enduring novel. It sticks with you long after you've finished reading it, settling into your subconscious, becoming part of you.

1416583432|4.0|Don't you ever wonder what dogs think? Or why does it matter if they think?<br />Alexander Horowitz has sought to answer some of the most basic questions we may have about our little four legged friends. She is a cognitive scientist and has taken this approach to examine a dog's life.<br />In this book you get a good overview of dogs communicate with smell. How domesticated dogs are very different from their wild wolves cousins. Why dogs bond with us and what cues they look for to communicate with us.<br />They say if you want a friend in politics, get a dog, but I think that is true in any profession, dogs will always love you no matter what.<br />This book is less of a training book and more of a understanding book, one person's view of a dog's life.
B00B1CGD5M|4.0|This is Soilwork's best, most technically proficient release since 'Natural Born Chaos'. Great riffs, amazing drumming and complex song structures (not to mention variety) make this, in my opinion, a candidate for album of the year. If you're a fan of melodic metal, this album is a must own!

B006LSZECO|5.0|And by an iffy start I mean, I was a little unsure about how well written it was going to be, but I reflect afterward on how the writer used this as well as many other means to draw the reader into the story. Not that they were needed as what a story it is - a roller-coaster of twist and turns and suspected truths and lies. A fabulous read and I know it will be a very talked about book and cast of characters at our next book club.
1595825045|5.0|This book, which features tons of never before seen artwork from the beloved show, ATLA, is a must have for any Avatar fan. At $20, this book is a real steal. Beautiful artwork coupled with insightful details and commentary make this book a true gem, and one book that I will cherish and enjoy time and time again. My only complaint is that this book is so short. There are thousands of pictures that were sadly left out, and it would have been awesome  if they could have at least added like 50 more pages. Alas, it is not so, but still this book is a wonderful collection to my book and Avatar collection.
0307346617|5.0|This book was so amazing, had to read it multiple times.  The writing can be so action packed and then quickly change to the slow creepy and disturbing.

0062014536|3.0|I read Delirium and Pandemonium in a span of about two days and I fell in love. I loved the characters, premise, love triangle...it was all great. I thought it was well written too, if a bit predictable (especially the end of Pandemonium). Requiem starts out great too. The conflict between Alex and Lena is understandable considering what had happened, and there are some really good plot twists (Hana!) and overall it's very engaging. Lena's evolution as a character is one of the best aspects of the book, and for the first half, I loved where the story was going. However, Oliver is really missing one thing -she completely ignores Julian's characterization. After spending a whole book on him, she lets his character go to almost complete waste. He barely has one real conversation with Lena, he always is just simply there, with a sentence or two dedicated to his presence. The only area where he shows any growth was his stance within the group and how that evolves. Other than that, his character falls extremely flat and it's hard to remember why we loved him in Pandemonium. I understand she didn't want to focus too heavily on the love triangle, but essentially ignoring one of the book's main characters was not really the best way to go. I felt the ending is unsatisfying too, mainly because we don't understand the motivations behind Lena's pick. I'm actually very equally divided between Julian and Alex, so it wasn't that her choice dissatisfied me...it was just that we never got a real WHY (or it wasn't addressed enough) and I felt like there was very little closure. Even regarding the revolution - what comes next? It's one thing to be up for interpretation but this was just completely open ended. I feel like the series, being as good as it was, deserves better, as do the characters!
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|As a longtime fan of Soilwork, I found their trajectory stemming from \\"The Chainheart Machine\\" through \\"Figure Number Five (FNF),\\" \\"Sworn to a Great Divide (STGD)\\" and \\"The Panic Broadcast (TPB)\\" to be a bit curious (FNF) and occasionally disappointing (TPB).  While \\"Chainheart\\" straddled a serrated edge between Thrash and Gothenburg-style of metal, Soilwork's evolution through \\"A Predator's Portrait\\" to its more recent releases borrowed from this foundation and evolved into a more mainstream but cohesive approach. While \\"artistically\\" the band might have found more fuel in this to make music, the results were sometimes uneven (i.e., STGD and \\"Stabbing the Drama\\") and unexpected.  However, every Soilwork album has had one overarching quality: They have all been high quality music on their own terms, created by conscientious musicians rather than stereotypical head-banging rockers.  They have all been worthwhile to listen to - even when compared to previous efforts and even if we would not have done it the same way.<br /><br />In terms of the superb standard set by Soilwork (SW), \\"The Living Infinite\\" approaches being their Magnum Opus (i.e., masterpiece). It is a consolidation of the lessons learned from their past efforts and culmination of the cohesion and ingenuity they have been trying to achieve, resulting in an album that has something for everyone in ample amounts. Of course, it took two discs and perhaps some fresh inspiration (or fear) created by the departure of co-founder Pete Wichers to do it, but they have succeeded where many music critics/pundits had become skeptical.<br /><br />As mentioned by others, the album contains two discs and 20 songs. The most uptempo songs (i.e., most recognizable SW \\"rockers\\") are:  \\"This Momentary Bliss,\\" \\"Tongue,\\" \\"Let the First Wave Rise,\\"  \\"Realm of the Wasted\\"  (from Disc 1), and  \\"Long Live the Misanthrope,\\" \\"Leech,\\"  \\"Rise Above the Sentiment,\\" and \\"Antidotes in Passing\\" from Disc 2.  Those songs evincing a more \\"original\\" SW approach (adding to the album's \\"variety\\") include: \\"Spectrum of Eternity,\\" \\"The Windswept Mercy,\\" and \\"Whispers and Lights\\" (Disc 1), and \\"Parasite Blues\\" and \\"Owls Predict, Oracles Stand Guard\\" (Disc 2).  Scattered are several solid offerings (i.e., \\"Memories Confined\\" and \\"Drowning With Silence\\"), and a few fillers (i.e., \\"Entering Aeons,\\" \\"Loyal Shadow,\\" and \\"Vesta\\").  In a curious way, the title tracks - \\"The Living Infinite I\\" and \\"...II\\" - link the two discs and, with it, the material overall.  While not as cohesive as a concept album, the song arrangement does give the album a distinct personality - making it a satisfying stand-alone work.  The only real missteps on the album are the ponderous \\"Owls Predict...\\" and unfocused \\"Vesta,\\" yet they are not enough to undermine the overall listening experience.  In any assessment, one must consider performances in totality. While I might have told \\"Speed\\" Strid and SW to shelve at least \\"Owls,\\" it clearly exists as a coda to the overall effort - one SW deemed necessary (even if I didn't).<br /><br />Where SW goes from here is anyone's guess but \\"...Infinite\\" proves that they are every bit as relevant and ingenious as any new Melo-death Metal arrivals (i.e., \\"The Unguided, \\"The Stranded,\\" \\"Rise to Fall,\\" etc.).  Like contemporaries \\"In Flames\\" and \\"Dark Tranquility,\\" they are still the gold standard of metal from which all other bands - from \\"Trivium\\" to \\"As I Lay Dying\\" to \\"Killswitch Engage\\" - can learn a great deal.

938002844X|4.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" is surely one of the most popular of his Sherlock Holmes detective stories, pitting the famous detective and his sidekick Dr. Watson against a half-legendary beast who threatens the heir of the Baskerville fortune in a remote village of Devonshire.  The story gets the graphic novel treatment here, courtesy of Campfire Classics, adapter J.R. Parks, and illustrator Vinod Kumar.<br /><br />The story opens with a rendition of the legend of the gigantic and deadly Hound of the Baskervilles, then backtracks to introduce the characters in the drama, including Holmes and Watson, the country physician Dr. Mortimer, and the new heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, just arrive from Canada.  Sir Henry is the subject of surveillance by parties unknown while in London, and Holmes sends Watson along with Sir Henry to Baskerville Hall to keep watch against further threats, apparently including the legendary Hound, which soon seems all too real.  Holmes himself will make a dramatic appearence in Devonshire, as the threads of the mystery begin to come together, and as it becomes obvious that Sir Henry's life and sanity are at stake...<br /><br />This book is a decent adaptation of the original, although the author presents the beginning of the story somewhat out of order and wrongfoots the narrative in a few places.  These changes are likely to be transparent to the first time reader, especially the younger reader.  Recommended.

It's that brand new item smell that you get from just about anything that may be covered in plastic.  I mean it's brand spanking new!  What do you expect?  Plus it's made of leather which has a distinct smell as well!  I would recommend this product to any and everyone I know.  One thing, remember its a cover.  Not a heavy duty-let me handle my Kindle like a frisbee or toss it around like a high school textbook case.  It's stylish and protects from normal wear.  So if you treat your Kindle like the expensive (relatively speaking) electronic equipment it is,  this case is great for you!

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really good game for its price. This is a good game if you like building or crafting.
B000001ES4|5.0|This is my FAVORITE CD!  Just love it.  The songs just speak to me.  - I wish Secret Garden would do another CD.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|All I can say is get this game you won't regret it if you enjoy building your own city...this game is a cross between city building, strategy and role playing which is a fantastic combination in a game
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector - I've always liked Tom Clancy & read almost all of his books. This was very good & you can see another one tagging on to this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool game especially on the kindle fire.  Easier to play then on the iPhone. Updates keep the game interesting.  Ads are minimal and not annoying.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book for a rainy day. Fun and suspenseful. Didn't see the movie, but I think it could be done well.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I waited 3 years to read this series, thinking it was dark and overhyped. I was wrong, loved this series.
0446556750|5.0|Michael Connelly has never disappointed me, in all the years I have been reading him.  This story was a different angle, making the hero become a prosecutor for the first time.  I liked the story, enjoyed reading about Bosch, one of my favourite characters.  If you haven't read Michael Connelly before, I would suggest getting one of his very early books, and carry on from there.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I love apps that work great and have no sneaky permissions. This calculator has lots of functions, so it is not for people who are easily intimated. If you need to do some serious arithmetic, give this a try.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|i have had other cases and once you get use to this you will enjoy it.  the only problem is the case will flip open if you are not careful but the kindle doesnt fall out !! this has only happened twice so it is not an on going issue, just the way i mishandled the case
B000JMLFLW|5.0|life in england just before the neopolianic war(?).  Jane Austen captures the life and time of england as in the late 1800's.  the changing classes, women's rights, old rules and new ways.  The main theme is personal impressions of other people and whether or not these impression pan out.  the main character forms and changes her oppinions of people multiple times, until she accepts her own pride and prejudices.  a great story.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|kids and adults like this game.  a little annoying when your coins fall off the edge but other than that pretty good
B006PKV2QU|4.0|I enjoyed this children's story \\"I Think It's a Rock\\" by Peter W. Collier. The rhyming style is a little different but it sticks in your head (think earworm for children). Nonsensical rhymes but children love that.<br /><br />The illustrations by Cameron Craig are spare and well drawn.<br /><br />I liked the book and will be reading it to my grandchildren when they get a little older. They are eleven months old and I would say this book would be appreciated by the 3-5 year old crowd.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Everyone loved it - great book to discuss with friends.  Loved learning about all the ups and downs of Cheryl's journey.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie, good story, and even if some scenes were changed to make the movie more exciting, it did not change the impact.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|maybe i shouldnt have listened to the audiobook version first...but then again if i hadnt i wouldnt have wanted to watch this movie. everyone seemed kind of rushed... no explaination of the characters, they were just kind of thrown into the movie. for example, skeeter just gets the job at the newspaper...viewers not knowing her character is very awkward and how she felt about going out with boys... the secret between minny getting a job...stewart not being ready to date....how he was feeling. i'm not even done with the full movie, but even i agree with some of the other reviews that this movie is slow. Only real interesting part of hte movie was when they are presenting the racial issues of that time. Award winning movie....i dont know about that..book yes, movie not in my opinion. Try the audiobook... its excellent... prob going to buy the book now.
0316077054|5.0|Couldn't have asked for a better price for this book! ust what I wanted. Read the 1st book so had to get the rest of the series!
0425252868|5.0|What a page turner!  I read this amazing and well told story over just a couple of days...I couldn't put it down and was saddened it was over when I finished.  My wife felt the exact same way. It's the perfect mixture of history, character development and drama all wrapped in an amazing story of humanity, kindness and bravery.  Add to the mix just how unlikely if was that this story even came to pass, not only in 1943, but in the 40 plus years that followed and you have a recipe for this extremely well written, edited and published book.  I would also like to say a huge \\"THANK YOU\\" to the greatest generation and all service men and women for your service to our country and to it's sometimes all too ungrateful citizens!
B005HS00XW|5.0|The Dvd concert was the best!! I so love the orchestra and Peter Gabriel always always goes over  and beyond everything he does.
0763619612|5.0|My 6 year old really enjoyed this book.  It is a great story and I can't wait to share it with my preschoolers as well.
B000JCQCW4|3.0|Everyone has their own addiction, even while viewing others addictions as much worse than their own. Trying to control the addiction is the challenge, recognizing it is whole separate issue. A sad accounting of how a family deals with themselves, each other and their associations with others.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Very strong product, everything I was expecting. I had a previous backback from wenger and probably will be always buying from Wenger.

B004MC8CA2|1.0|I can't really give this 1 star because it never showed up on my kindle fire hd even tho i tried again. That' ok tho because I found a great bible. It is the holy bible formated for ereader old & new testaments in american standard version. I love it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|very good cant wait for a sequel!!!!  I love the mystery games!!!  Its scarry and trilling and I would recommend this game to anyone!!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great story told in vivid prose. The book documents the horrors each man faced while doing his duty.  The context of the time makes Sticker' s act of chivalry even more remarkable.  A must read for any history buff.
1451695195|1.0|Sorry, but like many people, I suspect, I bought this book after losing a loved one (our 22-year old son to suicide) and, not being a religious person, I thought it might help me get to a place where I would believe my son was in heaven.  The author spends a third of his time on his life story, family, etc. (boring); a third talking about experiences that make little sense (nutty); and a third describing these experiences in the most hyperbolic and absurd terms possible (yes, that would be the hyperbole.)  Everything is like, &#34;if you could imagine the most..........., imagine it a million times more.&#34;  And &#34;a converstation with the Creator?&#34; Well, sorry, not in there.  Way too trippy and no comfort at all.  Tossed in the trash after reading a third and scanning the remaining two-thirds, which was just redundant.  If it helps you, I am happy for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game.  My family loves it we play together and compete.  Have had the occasional glitch where I have not been able to complete a competition.  But overall a very entertaining game.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|it as he best to watch and i will watch it all the time when its on weekly.. ITS AWSOME

B005PK1G76|5.0|Just received this today.  It fit my Liteway Plus stroller perfectly!!  I have not started using it, but it will definitely get the job done and looks well constructed.
B000QRIGLC|1.0|I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. I found it poorly written, with to much immature ranting about extraneous issues.
0694003611|3.0|I thought with all the positive reviews on this book that it would be something amazing...I was disappointed. It definitely looks like a book written and illustrated 60 years ago. Nothing special, I guess if I had read it as a child I would be more inclined to review it favorably.<br /><br />If you are like me and enjoy more &#34;updated&#34; illustrations and rhymes I would suggest Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site.
B000YRY7TO|5.0|JACKIE DID GOOD AGAIN!!! IT WAS LONG (THE GOOD LONG) AND SAD (THE GOOD SAD) AND FUNNY!!! AND THE FIGHTS WERE AWESOME OF COURSE!!!
B007REV4YI|3.0|(SPOILERS) Didn't like it as much as I hoped to.  Great actors.  Found it unbelievable that a rogue ex-agent, no matter how brilliant, would be able to murder the head of MI6, or rather, unconvincing in the scenario presented.  MI6's response not believable, it would be akin to a rogue ex-police officer, insane and annoyed by treatment from a previous supervisor, deciding to attack that police department, and under attack, the police department having only a few old six shooters to aid in its defense.  Most audiences would not believe it.  Instead, the fictitious MI6 would have many, many more resources than those presented in the film should a rogue ex-agent attack them, and the head of their agency holed up in an isolated house under the protection of a single agent and his gamekeeper is unconvincing.  With the layers of security most modern states are likely to have since 9/11, not believable that M and 007 would be the only ones deciding how to defend the head of MI6.  After all, the rogue ex-agent basically declared war on the state, and though he was presented as brilliant (I saw no brilliance, only insanity), the state would also have brilliant employees, and many more of them. No matter the rogue's resources, the state's would exceed them.  So I didn't believe act 2 or 3; also as M was so willing to allow her agents to die, I wondered how the fictitious MI6 in this story could possibly attract or keep employees who would know that the state didn't have their back.  Bond's return was explained by saying he was extremely patriotic, but even he was miffed into taking an unapproved leave upon discovering that M would sacrifice his life for the greater good.  I know nothing about espionage, but just common sense, why would a person sacrifice their life for a state which would not have their back, or at least, have it to a greater extent than that portrayed in this film.  I mean these agents risk their lives, of which they have only one.  The willingness to discard agents was necessary in this story, to show that M operated this way with agents, so it was understood why she would allow the villain to be sacrificed, but then the audience just asks, how is she able to keep agents? Who would work for her?  In 007 films, field agents frequently are in gun battles, it is extremely high risk.  A state would get a reputation for putting it's agents in high risk situations, and not having their back when the **** hit the fan.  It would be very hard to recruit top people.  So basically the story not presented in a believable manner.  If the filmmakers were determined to have the scenario of 007, M, and the gamekeeper isolated and fending off the madman and his goons on their own, then they needed, in the story, to better explain how their isolation came about.  Just having M and 007 deciding, on their own, that that was how the situation would play out was insufficient.  The story itself needed to prove how M and 007 could have such authority, and how the other high security agencies in England were obliged to accept their decision.  The head of MI6 is shown to have power in this story, but in this story, the entire state was under attack, not just M, and it is unbelievable that only M and a trusted agent would have final say in this fictitious situation.  Say, for example, the prime minister was under attack, would he be able decide, by himself, with one of his aids, to fight off the attacker, even if a sole agent went with him.  No, especially if the attacker had killed other citizens as well.  No single person has that much authority; I believe state security to be a multi-agency responsibility, especially under terrorist threat, which this villain was.  Strengths of the movie - actors, pacing, action.  I found a subplot believable, the lover shared by Bond and the villain (forget her name); she was sold into sex slavery as a child, bought by a sadist and then murdered by him.  She bet on Bond, hoping he could help her, even trying to get him to avoid the villain.  Under orders he could not do so, but the violence suffered by this woman character, her fear, so convincingly portrayed by the talented actress, was very believable.  In a world where many women daily are murdered by the men in their lives, I yearn to see better options for women in film and in reality.
B0085A9J18|5.0|I BEEN INTO THIS WING CHUN IP MAN KINDA STREAK AND THIS WAS MY CHANGE IN FIGHTING MOVIE! BOY WAS I GLAD I DECIDED TO CHANGE IT UP A BIT!!! I DIDNT KNOW THE INDONESIANS GET DOWN LIKE THIS!!! IKO UWAIS AND JOE TASLIM WERE BEAUTIFUL AND AMAZING!!!

B00B2DSIAI|5.0|I got this movie for my nephew's kindle. He loved it and so did I. Such a cute children's movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really great on the kindle fire H.D. but on the iPod it always closes on the loading screen.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Wasted my money, could only watch a few min. of this filth. Dont waste your time, maybe it gets better but we could not get past the opening.Would you sit with your mother and watch this ?
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved this film it reminded me a lot of The Raid but in a great way!... Sly Stallone ain't got nothing on this masterpiece pick this up and add it to your collection!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is simply the best game! You can play as little or as much as you like and still have a great time either away.  It is great for all ages! Play it TODAY!
B004IFYMYI|5.0|This is one of the Best movies I have seen yet?... Great Story Great Character Development something that everyone should have in their Collections. Nothing Wrong with it!
1616550414|5.0|very good edition, this book i liked so much.<br />I liked this book a lot, very good editing agrees to expectations.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show I would recommend it to everyone I know. If you haven't watched they s show yet you must see it, there is drama, anticipation, great actors, and the effects are great.
B001TWT0AE|4.0|The dvd was all it was described to be.  gave this rating of 4 stars as I have not wathced it to completion.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This is a parred down, disciplined way of tackling many physical care problems. True to form, Tim delivers on things that work consistently when you follow the rules. Not for everyone, but it is great for those who are looking for the most effective of short cuts. I only have one disagreement with Tim- prolotherapy. It has been amazingly effective for me. I've had both rotator cuffs and labrums torn, and I healed them to full recovery and beyond (about 180% recovery on one) with prolotherapy. I've probably had over 1000 injections, and no infection problems.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|good shape, no issues.  Loved the movie and highly recommend it.  Christian Bale rocks!  It won't disappointment you and your popcorn.
B00940XIGU|5.0|This version comes with a lot more songs, and remixes.  It is by far, better than version 1.0.  The quality of the mp3s off Amazon is good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I absolutely love this show!  It is very well written in British fashion with a dry wit, which can be off-putting to a large segment of American audiences who expect mindless action and corny dialogue and are lost on subtlty.  It's visually stunning with amazing scenery, costuming, and furnishings.  Watching the dynamics of both upstairs and down, you get pulled in and the feeling you're part of the household.  I can't wait to finish the 3rd season so I can move on to the 4th and get caught up.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A look into the life of a warrior and a hero. His story should help us appreciate all of their sacrifices.  He will be missed.
0811874192|5.0|Beautiful, fun and clever. The flowers are colorful, intricate and have a handmade look. Great as a centerpiece on a table.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Amazing Read. This book gives an amazing perspective on life and love and the un-waivering affection of a loyal companion!
B000Y5JFNE|1.0|Ain't no way I'm spending more than $5 bucks for a 25 year old movie. The pricing on this is offensive.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Won't win any literary prizes I don't think - but if you are a fan of the movie or book series you will enjoy it. Out of all 3 books I think the beginning of this one was a little long winded and tedious, but the last half certainly revs up and is exciting reading!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a lot of my fun.  my daughter loves playing it all the time.  there is never a dull moment while playing the game.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great little game...for kids and easily amused adults alike. Fun and wholesomefor all ages. i look forward to trying more games from the maker.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|The wife and I both heard Bruno on Saturday Night Live and he sounded very good, and any band that can sound good on Saturday Night's stage must be good as their acoustics on the stage have never been great. I saw this album on Amazon at a discounted special so I downloaded the MP3 version. The lyrics are excellent and the band plays well. I would give it 5 stars except the quality of the recording itself is just not there. It is not the group, but the recording. I would like to give it 5 stars, but I want to be honest at the same time because I use Amazon reviews to purchase everything I buy from Amazon. I hope this helps.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I think that Jeff let us down with the 4 & 5  books so a novel like this is well appreciated from the fans. There were laughs and suspense, an overall good book.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I am interested to purchase the first season of Supernatural but I need to have subtitles in Spanish. Can you help?
B0000VCZK2|4.0|too much of a thing may not be so great.<br />still 3out of 4 great movies<br />Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I am a big fan of Siris/XM ALT Nation and their Alt-18. I originally heard Imagine Dragons when their hit \\"Radioactive\\" was on there for weeks. I bought the whole album and was pleasantly surprised as to how much I enjoy all of their songs. Give them a try if you're looking for something fresh, yet alternative.
B000244EMO|4.0|Its a good film. a little low brow but still. it could have been a lot worse<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B007STBUHI|2.0|Disappointed. For all the &#34;newly restored from original 35mm elements&#34; hype, the 2012 region-1 DVD is significantly blurrier than the 2005 (30th anniversary) region-2 DVD I already owned. The new edition is superficially &#34;cleaner&#34;, yes, but the boosting of contrast and noise reduction resulted in a very noticeable loss of overall detail. The two stars are for the botched new DVD transfer, of course. But this is the product I'm reviewing here. This really should look very different, new &#34;HD&#34; master and all ...<br />And, this is not about the limits of the DVD format either. (My benchmark DVD with regard to overall detail and sharpness still is the 2001(!) R2 edition of North by Northwest. Those who own it know what I'm talking about.)
B001DSNELA|5.0|I loved the action, and suspene. as well as the  chase scene!<br />Go BOND!!!!!!<br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|You can't deny Bruno's incredible talent and the arrangements are interesting.  Some of the songs seem to try a little too hard at being clever but overall this is a solid CD.
B0007RT9LW|4.0|some of the acting is bad in this but its still a fun ride for the most part.<br />Recommended<br /><br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fantastic for horse lovers and for kids to have fun and learn about horse care, that carries over to so much. A horse is a big expense and commitment of time and I think this is a great step for young ones before caring for the real thing. You can't hurt this horse, but the app tells you if you are taking care properly. It's a great idea and a lovely, relaxing app for kids, future horse owners or just horse lovers. Thank you for inventing it :) PS  I would love to see trail riding incorporated somehow if that is possible with this app.... :)<br /><br />I have to edit my review after this recent update. I have changed from 5 stars to three due to 2 full screen pop up ads after every single interaction with your horse. It is extremely annoying. If a new update does not minimize these ads to something more reasonable, I will uninstall and let you all know. I will also let you know if the developers listen and fix this.  Whatever comes, I will give another edit to this review to either install this app and praise the developers for correcting this or to warn you not to waste your time closing out pop up ads over and over and over....I think you get the picture :) Stay tuned....today is March 16 2013
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Great spy thriller.. Hanna makes the Terminator look like a paraplegic.<br />It has great hang to hang combat action, music , and suspense.

0741470314|5.0|This book is by far at the top of my book list. It is the only book I have ever read, and started reading it all over again as soon as I finished reading it. The book is written with great sensetivity, giving the reader an honest insight to Michael Jackson life, the reader will understand what he was trying to make the world understand when he said he was the lonliest person in the world. He was a prisoner of his own fame, terrified of the fans he loved and who supported him. This is a must read for Michael Jackson fans, but also for those who labelled him wacko jacko, for them to realise the part they played in helping to destroy his life.
B000ASATYO|3.0|Director cut is ok but it could be better film. Its kinda too silly.. Still its worth watching at least once<br /><br />If anyone has any questions on the product dont be afraid to ask me.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing for this is absolutely horrendous. The first POV shows the character to be flat without any real personality. I couldn't even get past the second chapter without being bored out of my mind. I frankly can't understand the obsession with this series other than the subject matter. But there are plenty of other books out there about it that must be better written! This is terrible!
B00006FDCJ|4.0|I remember when this first came out. It seems very realistic.. not showboating or glorifying gunslingers like  western films in the past did.<br /><br /> Recommended!<br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me.

B00104QSOM|5.0|This movie There Will Be Blood  added a second Oscar to Daniel Day-Lewis collection and for good reason. This is one of the best acting jobs of all time's. This man has the ability to make you love him and hate him all in one movie. If you haven't had the privilege of allowing this film to take you to the oil scene of the early 1900's do it. There has not been another performance of this caliber in the history of film. ENJOY

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book broke my heart. And that's okay. Every once in awhile you come across a story that you really aren't sure will end with a satisfying affirmation that all will be--eventually--right with the world. It's the mark of a great story teller to keep you invested in a tale even though you're not certain how it will end; that the hero might not survive. That good people might have died in vain. That sometimes the ends might not justify the means, and it doesn't matter because both just suck.<br /><br />It's depressing at times, but it's good storytelling. It's compelling narrative. And it's the mark of a ballsy writer. I can respect that.<br /><br />There were some grammatical and editing issues that were rather jarring and broke up the pace for me, but overall I could easily overlook these because everything else about this book was SO good. The pacing of the plot in particular was brilliant and every intricacy was eventually addressed, every question answered--even small things I didn't expect would be important later. I loved this story. I loved the characters. I loved the ending. This book completely knocked my socks off and I can't wait for the next one.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|considering its a ship full of wesley crushers.. its not that bad. only problem is half of the film makes NO sense<br /> Recommended!<br />If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them.
0765325950|2.0|When Sanderson took over the series, I was happy it would be finished. I thought the Gathering Storm was okay. It was obviously a different writer, but it didn't detract too terribly from the story. However, it seems that the further on we go, the worse it becomes. In Towers of Midnight, the characters began to act a bit unusually, making developmental leaps without proper explanation for the changes. The shift to new characters, obviously so that Sanderson could write his own and not have to try to imitate Jordan completely, became a negative factor. Drawing to the end of the story, I was looking for resolution of the characters I already knew, not introduction of new ones I wouldn't care about.<br /><br />A Memory of Light reads like a poorly written fanfiction. It seems more like something that would be made by an inexperienced teen writer who wanted to make their own ending for a series they liked. It is all very Out-of-Character. I have not read Sanderson's other works, so I can not judge by them. The characterization is poor in A Memory of Light, and the development has grown even worse since Towers of Midnight. I found myself unable to connect to my favorite characters because they changed so drastically...without anything to really explain the changes. I believe this comes down to it simply being a different writer. Sanderson couldn't write the characters, so they seem like different people.<br /><br />Now, I made my way through the book--it was the last in the series, and I was determined to finish it--but I did not enjoy it as I should have. I had been wondering at the ending for years, though I think Sanderson began to make it a bit too obvious in the books leading up. Still, I was looking forward to the resolutions of all the plot lines and seeing how the characters end up. I found the ending to be atrociously written. It sickened me. After so many years waiting for it, I wish it hadn't been written. It is not so much the idea of the ending, which is somewhat how it should have been, but simply the way it was done. That has to come down to the man writing. I do not know how much of the ending Jordan had planned out. I would love to see his notes on it. But the way it was written was so badly done that even a perfectly conceived end would have been ruined. I will not be reading works by Sanderson. He's proven himself an inept writer.<br /><br />The ending itself doesn't feel complete enough for a series of this length and complexity. There are so many characters, the epilogue should have run fairly long, giving endings for each, but it didn't. You are left guessing, perhaps with indicators of which way to go but no actual ending for most of the characters. This may be a stylistic difference. I have never enjoyed endings that were so completely unfinished. There was too much that needed to be done for this to feel like a completed work. The ending for Rand is pathetic. The idea could have been written so much better. Instead, it feels cheap, shallow, and Out-of-Character.<br /><br />I always get depressed upon finishing a series, saying goodbye. However, it took a full 2 hours for that to kick in after finishing A Memory of Light. I was so annoyed, frustrated, and sickened by the ending that I could not feel like I had actually finished The Wheel of Time. I will choose to see this as a fanfiction by a poor writer, and perhaps make up my own ending, for I know that even I could have done better than this.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is phenomenal. Another great one by FX! They never disappoint the show is action packed right from the first episode.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I am glad I finally found this!  My favorite is &#34;Down by the River&#34; and although it is a great version, if you like that song, please listen to Buddy Miles version of it.  You cannot go wrong with this CD!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|what a great way to end a stressful day . the fact that it is free makes it even better. the sounds are amazingly clear.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I watch this DVD all the time. The story is so interesting. AudreyHepburn has always been a favorite of mine. What she endures through out her years as a nun is outstanding. I would purchase this again if I had too.
B00B2JOJIM|5.0|This song makes me think about many things, both about the music and about the words. Really I like much and with others that I have listened that they walk patrolling for Internet that they are &#34;Angel&#34; and &#34; All That`s Mines &#34;, I believe that one comes Depeche Mode's great album, already I wait for it with anxieties
1616550414|5.0|with the purchase of this book I am able to delve deep into the legend of zelda lore. with my newfound knowledge I plan to find a way to tron myself into the game and help link on his journey.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|Perfect V-Day gift!  i really could not go wrong with this gift.  I hav enot personally listened to his but have heard nothing but praise
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You become so involved with all the characters.  Love the costumes and seeing the elite lifestyle and the below stairs problems too.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|You can't go wrong with free!  I loved reading this book.  Thomas Hardy knows how to tell a tragic, fate oriented book.  I couldn't stop reading until it was over.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|We loved the first & 2nd books but this one doesn't seemto fullfill the same expectations of the prior ones. Still a good story, not a charmer
B0094K20FK|5.0|This is by far one of the best of the star trek movies.  Bringing back Ricardo Montalban as Khan was brilliant.  He took the movie from a 'B' to an 'A+'.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you saw or read hunger games this is a must to follow the story. Loved the connection between the books and someday they will make a movie out of this one too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this book, it's a different type of gendre than I usually read but it kept me intrigued and interested. I'm starting on book two now to find out how what if anything happens with the relationship.
B008B68IV8|5.0|Ghoulia is a favorite, no matter who you are morning are really... ugggrrrh...  Excellent costume and details, which she did have her stand, fun all.
B007KLY8FA|5.0|You can get a better price at half dot comedy but the most important thing about this reissue is it contains an Argo-issued album NOT AVAILABLE on the expensive Mosaic compilation \\"Complete ARGO Trio Recordings\\". \\"Chamber Music of the New Jazz\\" is a transitional album between the Okeh/Epic piano/guitar/bass trio and the latter Argo piano/bass/drums format. Some say the earlier drumless recordings influenced Miles to hire Red Garland playing in Jamal's style on Jamal compositions. I have the original Argo LP and the pressing is terrible, so to me getting this on CD is worth the price of the box set.
B00846REIS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Can't wait for #3 to come out in June. Really good easy reads. GREAT!
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This is my kind of game.  Very addictive if you like arcade type games. Similar to Mario.<br />Like the way you can make him jump higher and longer.
B007SGM084|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because they really were good reads. Book 2 and 3 got a little drawn out but overall was really good.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Love my Kindle Fire HD.  Very nice to watch movies when<br />traveling and not needing a Wi Fi connection. It is an all in one tool,<br />good for reading, playing games and watching videos.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i think this game teaches responsibility that it takes totakecare of a horse and to love it and care for it. i think its fun to interact and train  the horse.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wonderful book<br />So sad to have lost this hero.  So Sad our President couldn't be bothered by his death or even his accomplishments
1452110581|4.0|It was the best as far as poetry books go.  Im just not as much of a poem person.  But it was for a good laugh.
B006YZOXHQ|5.0|My Mom dropped me off at the theater when I was 13 for my birthday. I got there at noon and left at 8 pm. I had my first 8 hour run of Camp,burning plastic sets and more impotently to a 13 year old,MY FIRST T&A flick!!! I hadn't seen it  30+ year unedited till now. It's still a fun movie. It brought back a flood of memories.  Like going back the next weekend with all my other 13-14 year old friend for another look. Were there ratings then? I don't remember.<br /> Well worth the money, excellent picture quality. Lots of Jane Fonda to look at,LOL!
B003G4W49C|2.0|Ender's Game is one of my favorite books, so when I saw that it was available for my brand new Kindle Fire HD and it was \\"The Ender Quintet\\", (and I've read all Card's books,) I was excited.  For only $6.99 I could get all 5 books, I thought (silly me!).  But no, after I got it & reread it (or the upteenth time), it was only the one book.  I contacted Amazon.com customer service & was offered a refund of the full price, which would negate my purchase & make it unavailable to me to read. I applaud Amazon.com for wanting to make this right, though I was not offered all 5 books for that price (oh, well!)  I chose to write a lower-starred review instead, but only because of the way it was presented by Amazon.com:<br />Pros:  An enjoyable, well written book!<br />Cons:  None, about the book.  I just wish Amazon.com would have detailed it \\"book 1 of the quintet\\" or something more clear for the novice.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Great movie,but,I will wait for the extended version around Christmas. Not doing that rodeo again. Haven't we learned anything from the last go around?
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app but I think it should updated and NOT NEED Wi-Fi thx bye hAve a nice happy meal
B001PPGAJE|3.0|This was an addition to my Bluray collection, and a great movie.  The price I was able to get it at made it even better!  I highly recommend this movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Often the second or third book in a series is not equal to the first.  This book was just as well written as the first.  I am looking forward to reading the third book in this series.  The characters were well defined and it was full of action with very few 'slow' moments.  I do think if you have not read The Hunger Games, the first book in this series that you would be lost.  If you want to get the full impact of this book and understand all the references, please read it in the order this series was written.,
B000HIVOI2|2.0|I don't know, for some reason I just couldn't get into this movie.  For whatever reason it just seemed to drag on, I couldn't wait for it to end!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have this Spider card game on my Kindle. Everyone in this family love this game. You can set it at three level of play, Easy one deck, middle two decks or very hard four decks of cards.
B000U7169W|5.0|I think this movie is really underrated!  It's very well put together and has a great story behind it.  I would highly recommend it.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Worth the watch, a bit gory, but overall a nice mix of comedy, romance, and adventure.  I highly recommend it :)
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|This is a great movie, full of action, and of course, Angelina Jolie!!  I recommend this movie, its one of those you'll find yourself watching every couple months!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I didn't want to like this movie and ended up loving it! I could do without the puking parts, really, I don't get it, but it didn't really matter because the rest of the film was just so great! And I need to figure out how to do that cup song. That was awesome! If gratuitous projectile vomiting isn't your thing, watch this anyway - you won't regret it!
B000Q6ZG5M|3.0|This was an addition to my Bluray collection, and a great movie.  The price I was able to get it at made it even better!  I highly recommend this movie!
B007M45PMU|5.0|Talented!!! I like the simplicity of the lyrics although on some songs the meaning is deep. The music (banjos or whatever string instruments mixed with the drums) is OMG. Love this and I need a break from the other music out today.
B00319ECGK|4.0|This was an addition to my Bluray collection, and a great movie.  The price I was able to get it at made it even better!  I highly recommend this movie!
B007LE2VDM|5.0|I can see over the years I gravitate towards hunting voices (the ones that stay with you and touch your emotions). My brother calls it suicide music but I beg to differ, it is emotional music. Music that is rich and gets inside you and helps you through but he and I are different :). Christina Perri has that type of voice. The song has good songs and I don't have to skip tracks.
0062014536|1.0|WTF - that was my reaction when the book ended (and I don't cuss much). Talk about a book with no resolution - for the story, for the love triangle, for any of the major characters (Lena, Hana, Julian, Alex)... In fact, you don't even really know what happens to Fred (does he die or not???).<br /><br />I am so let down, so upset by this ending. Not that the rest of the book was awesome either. It was a boring, meandering journey - like the author had no idea where the story was going - that ended in an open-ended climax. Maybe Lena, Alex & Julian will become an awesome threesome and live happily ever after in bigamy - who knows? Maybe Hana will walk all the way to China - who knows? Maybe all those who've been cured will live in harmony with the Invalids - who knows? Your guess is as good as mine...<br /><br />So this book, hands down, wins the lamest ending ever to a series (and I thought the Crossed series ended lamely). And to think her first two books were so awesome. Massive massive letdown. For all the people who're saying stuff like - yeah, it's different and HEA doesn't always happen in real life - well, this was simply a cop-out on the author's part. I felt she had no idea where the story was going or she hadn't actually thought out in advance how it was supposed to end, so she simply let it all hang there. How would you feel if JK Rowling ended the Harry Potter series like this - no ending to Voldermort, no proper resolution to the story? Stories are not reality, and they should have an ending and some closure for the readers.
B001200MXW|5.0|The beauty of Morrison Hotel is equal to the beauty of U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind, in the sense that they are both returns to the roots of the band after having dabbled in experimentation with uneven results.  Although neither band recaptures their original spark, they reveal a flame that has matured through time.<br /><br />Jim Morrison felt he was really just an ol' blues man and this album attempts to reflect the then current metamorphasis.  Morrison Hotel kicks off with Roadhouse Blues...singing, 'going to the Roadhouse and gonna have a real, good time.  Let it roll, baby, roll!'  ...and that they did.  It was a strong way to start off an album and it also screams, 'we're back!' You feel a rawer, stripped down sound from the get go. You also see why this is one of their best songs. You also get a feel that the band is done with theatrics and just enjoy making music again.<br /><br />What follows Roadhouse is one of my favorite Doors' songs, Waiting for the Sun. Just a great song that builds up, with great lyrics that are backed with the perfect music accompaniment to create a mood of anxiety that seems to find its release in the final moments.<br /><br />The real gem on this album is Peace Frog.  It is actually a combination of two of Jim's poems playing side by side.  Partially biographical, if you know any of the band's history with legal entanglements, you will understand references to American cities.  Regardless, that is not necessary to enjoy the song.  It is just a good guitar riff with a good rock tempo.<br /><br />Apart from the sound, the second strong point of Morrison Hotel is the coherency of all the songs. Even the weak moments are given greater merit by the tapestry woven together as a whole. It is one album to be listened to from start to finish.thod of playing.  Just a great song that builds up, with great lyrics that are backed with the perfect music accompaniment to create a mood of anxiety that seems to find its release.<br /><br />The real gem on this album is Peace Frog.  It is actually a combination of two of Jim's poems playing side by side.  If you know any of the band's history with legal entanglements, you will understand part of the lyrics referring to specific American towns.  Regardless, that is not necessary to enjoy the song.  It is just a good guitar riff with a good rock tempo,<br /><br />Another one of my favorites is Land Ho!  It is a sea shanty with a good-timey feel to it.  Not your normal Doors fare but, what it?  I think that was part of the point, not to be normal and to seek to surprise.<br /><br />As for the slower songs, they fit in well.  I am particularly fond of Queen of the Highway.  It seems to be an ode to Jim's relationship with Pam.<br /><br />If you listen to this as an album, I give it the five stars for the exact reason that I included as the subject, it is a good mixture of rock, blues and some crooning.  Some songs do not stand as well by themselves, while others are definite classics.  It is the feel of the entire album that makes each song work.  It is like listening to Pearl Jam's Ten, when you listen from start to finish, you will be glad you did.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I personally think this a good book that basically reminds us critical essentials and techniques to start conversations with both loved ones and strangers and points out simple methods for keeping those conversations going.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|This is my first introduction to the Deftones.  What caught my eye was reading about the inclusion of former Quicksand bass guitarist, Sergio Vega, on this effort.  I was a huge fan of that hardcore band growing up in my twenties.<br /><br />After checking this album out, I became an instant fan.  Just the opening chords of Swerve City sucked me in.  It packs a punch while still including someone that can sing.  Good stuff.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Loved this scifi. watching it made an evening feel like i was back home, also enjoyed my Orvele Redenbacher popcorn with this move. Thank you for you prompt shipping and support.

B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was very well written, and kept you . Wanting to hurry and turn the page to see what was going to happen next.
B000FCK8ZK|2.0|isn't the word.  I had heard so many good things about the tv series that I thought I'd read the books  Don't know if I want to even start the next one.  Weird beyond weird, hard to follow or stay into.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Use the stylist pen is so much fun.  A must play if you like spider solat<br /> So much easier than using a mouse

B0000AUHPB|5.0|This Italian job was in Italy.  Very funny.  &#34;You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off! &#34; and ends with a cliffhanger.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|So I really have nothing good or bad to say about it.  Was looking forward to trying it though.<br /><br />.

B00AE2J93I|5.0|FUN movie-great for family night!  Rent it today-my grown &#34;children&#34; and I haven't laughed at a movie like we did when we watched this one in a long time!
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Over a Million Horses died in WWI, yet very few know about it. This is a story as might have truly been in that War. The love of a young man for the Horse he raised and trained, then taken to face the Horrors of the Modern Battlefield with all the things that strike terror in us all, much more so in animals. I love Horses and consider them brave and noble Animals; beautiful to watch of immense value to Man.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I was captivated from the first page.  I loved the fact that I needed to get to the last couple pages to get all the answers.  Very well written book.  I will buy more of Kate Morton's books.  Very enjoyable.  JB
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really liked this book.  I won't go into long details or anything, but suffice it to say it's a story that I really enjoyed.

0131103628|5.0|Along with the Kochan and King books, this is my favorite C book (why all the K's?).<br /><br />It's pretty short, a real virtue. But it really covers everything and has lots of examples.<br /><br />After many years of using C, I still enjoy re-reading parts of this book.
0061906220|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  My girls (1and 1/2 and 3 years) absoluetly love it!  The music that goes with the book is so much fun.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|enjoy playing it . it better than bejewel, i send hours playing the game. would like more like it form amazon
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks and this one lived up to it's potential for me.  I could not put this one down and was rather satisfied with the ending.  I do understand where some people say they don't like certain twists that occur, I do believe it really helps to build Katie's character.
1616550414|5.0|From Cover to Cover this book is every Zelda fans dream. The artwork is amazing, and after almost 30 years of wondering where each game takes place in the series it is amazing to finally know the exact order.<br /><br />I am hoping that this book is just the beginning of a long series, one that will chronicle every game that comes out.
0345803493|4.0|was ok.  I heard great things about these books. kept me interested i guess, but was just about people having sex, and fighting.. and having sex.... and spanking... haven't started the 2nd one cuz i have better things to read.............
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This was a great book with an interesting story. I tore through this book, although it had a lot of profanity which is something I normally would never go for. But by the end of this book I was sobbing and hugging my wonderful family because this story really tore my heart out. I would give it to any sad-romance lover because it is wonderful.
080508990X|5.0|my 9 month old likes to turn the pages on his own and i love that the pages can't be torn by him. great buy and fun for baby. excellent story as well.

B0042FZOFU|5.0|extremely reasonable price! my son loves these movies and for 3 blu rays for the price, it doesn't get any better than this. a must buy for ur child's disney collection.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|Used the VOD last night it was a frustrating experience. It took 2 hours to watch episode 1. I had to constantly restart the video, watched the video buffer more than I watched the show, bad, bad experience! At least I had the free Amazon Prime to watch and know now that I will keep Netflix. Can I say it enough, bad, bad experience. Shame I won't be able to watch the rest Downton Abbey.  I enjoy the series but not at the cost of my sanity trying to watch Amazon VOD
B009FZHYKU|5.0|my husband and i are hooked on walking dead and since weren't able to watch season 3 on netflix and reruns were of season 2, we found it here on amazon. which was such a convenience because u can watch it from ur tv and with lightning fast service. i highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for the best service and is anxious about what's gonna happen next on the walking dead.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Chose 5 stars because this book was an easy fun read! Enjoyed the whole series and I'm sad to see it end

B0070Y46UY|5.0|I've never seen the movie but I kept hearing how good it was so I decided to read the book first. The beginning was slow for me but once he got shipwrecked it got easier to read. Such a great story
B004WR125O|3.0|Works as advertised..but it does drop the wifi signal at times. Others have also remarked at the weak signal issue, but, it's the only game in town if you want to connect.  Easy to set up through the receiver (I have HT-RC460).
140131046X|5.0|I have even more.  As a Reform Jew who attends Shabbat services Friday evenings, bible classes with our Rabbi and educational classes about the history of the Jewish people with another Rabbi, I found Mitch Albom's book, Have a Little Faith, a tour de force which has further instilled my faith.  This book left me with the most wonderful feelings about religion and both the Rabbi and Minister whom the author talked about.  I found that many of my questions were brought up and while there may have been no definitive answers, Albom and his Rebs certainly led me not only to think more about these subjects but to discuss them as well with religious leaders of all faiths as as well as those who consider themselves to have faith.  Last Friday night after services, our Rabbi appproached me about his sermon and I mentioned I was beginning Have a Little Faith.  Our Rabbi then said a friend recently gave him this title.  My next comment was when you finish this book, let's have a discussion.  And I can't wait. For now, I am recommending this title to everyone and anyone who will listen.<br /><br />As an addendum, my husband and I recently moved back to our old NJ community after living in an over 55 community for over 6 years.  While many enjoy this way of life with adult activities etc., we missed our community in Northern New Jersy.  But the other day I ran into a neighbor from the over 55 community and she asked about our new house and community. She asked if our community had a pool and I answered, \\"Yes.\\"  Did we have tennis courts, \\"Yes.\\"  Did we have the ever important clubhouse and I said, \\"No.\\"  To which she asked, \\"What do you do for a clubhouse?\\"  To which I answered, \\"We have our Temple.\\"  And yes I do have more than a bit of faith and I bet Mitch Albom does have a little faith as well.
B00A83075M|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie and so did my 6 year old.  We just finished watching the 3D DVD at home and I must say that you should save your money!  Buy the Blu-ray skip the 3D, its nothing spectacular and not worth the extra money.  LOVE THE MOVIE, there is just no impressive 3D parts.  None.
0984380213|5.0|This book makes a clear, compelling and irrefutable case for the value of a dedicated teleprospecting operation. The story starts off with Aaron on the phone personally (after failing miserably as the young CEO of a dotcom start up), proving the business case, and then gradually scaling up.  There are numerous, practical insights about compensation, voicemails, divisions of labor, emails, dashboards, and all manner of operational nuggets.  No wonder salesforce.com grew so fast.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I am a fan, not just of Porcupine Tree, but of Steven Wilson's solo efforts, and his collaborative releases with Blackfield, as well as his contributions as a producer on many of Opeth's releases.  So, with that in mind, here is my take.....  This has become my favorite Porcupine Tree release.  It's not that I don't love the rest, which I do to varying degrees, it's just that this, of all their body of work, is what I consider to be a masterpiece.  The cd flows from beginning to end.  The lyrics, although dark, are quite extrordinary, even though I do not care for some of the thought process which was expressed.  The compostions, musically, are stunningly beautiful. My advice is to listen to it in it's entirety a few times, then make up your mind, which is basically how I try to treat any cd I purchase.  In this case, the first time through was more than enough for me to claim it to be my personal favorite Porcupine Tree release.
B005I6HZ1S|5.0|In 2013, or 1818, science fiction pushes us to ponder our human desires and their moral, ethical and societal costs<br /><br />Mary Shelly's Frankenstein should be required reading for all of the Harvard MBA's who brought the world to the brink of financial destruction - but then, that would require them to have a conscience, a sense of good/evil, cause/effect, choice/consequence, or societal benefit/personal greed<br /><br />It is ironic, that Mary Shelly, was younger than these same MBA's when she wrote Frankenstein, yet, she was more mature and &#34;worldly aware&#34; than these self centered, &#34;educated-elite&#34; will ever be.<br /><br />A phenomenal read!
0395925037|5.0|No explanation is necessary. This was what he wrote in prison.<br />Shows hw sick he was..a man who lead Germany into almost<br />destroying civilization. Required reading during WW2 for newly married<br />couples..should be required reading today in parts of the world.<br />But how he maneuvered to take over the Reich is also something<br />to read. The man was a smart lunatic...who knew how to use people's hatreds<br />against one another for his ends.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|The movie starts with an unnecessary, provocative scene of a nude woman walking around the hotel room she shares with Denzel--going back and forth in front of the camera several times in a long scene that seems to have no purpose other than to show female nudity. It turns out she is a flight attendant who has a brief part saving a child as the plane is crashing.  We need to know that she and Denzel are \\"close\\" to explain why he tells the truth later about what happened, but this could be done without so much nudity.  Another sequence visits the set of a porno movie and has dialogue that is quite vulgar and unnecessary.  How any of this relates to the main message about substance addiction is largely undeveloped.  I felt that the movie tried to make up for it's limitations by throwing some grossness our way at the beginning.  After 10 or 15 minutes the movie begins and is a fair movie otherwise.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|Seriously? I got this book for free??? Seriously???<br /><br />It's like a drug dealer giving free samples of the product to reel in another sucker. And you know what? I'm going to go buy the next book in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like Shades of Grades. You will love these. Not so XXX. Which I like. Feels like you know these peaple.
B009FIN4E2|4.0|This is classic Dolph and great 80's movie for guys who like guy movies like Commando, Rambo 2 and 3, Tango & Cash and other guy flics back in the day. They make a great Saturday or Sunday lazy movie day.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book! Could have done without some of the graffic sex parts. These books make it hard to find another good. Book.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I have waited months to see how this ends. Loved the first two books. Wanted an ending. Got... more questions. What happens to Jana, what happens with Lena and Alex, what about the people, what about Julian. Nothing. Not happy I waited and feel like I wasted a day reading and $10.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was very good. I recommend it to all that love music. Could have played down the cursing, but it is college.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a really wonderful series!  We are watching season 3, and will be so sorry when it is over!
B007TNS6JI|2.0|I was going onto multiplayer and it was logging in but it never let me play multi player<br />Awesome solo though
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I'm beginning to see a theme with the 3rd book of dystopia series. First Mocking Jay and now Requiem. Such disappointing endings. The ending of Requiem seemed rushed and I'm left wanting more. An epilogue would have been nice to wrap up the characters, but instead we are left to wonder what happens to them. I'm really hoping that the 3rd book in the Divergent series doesn't end the same way.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|After waiting a very long time for it to load, it doesn't even work. Frustrated. Fix it please. I was looking forward to playing it.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I got this for my 6 year old granddaughter because she loves anything to do with Monster High. She LOVED it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Gripping, on the edge of your seat drama lovers - this series continues to deliver as well as the last 2 seasons. Very suspenseful and exciting but also quite gory violence but isn't that to be expected when battling &#34;Walkers??&#34;
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This is a very fitting sequel to Happy Feet. This is a great movie with the cutest little penguin ever.
B0014VPFTA|4.0|I kinda overlooked this CD awhile back but am glad I finally picked it up.  It will give you some insight on John's roots and the evolution of his music.  Many fans consider this his signature album and I can see why.  It's mostly smooth music, yet stylistic and never boring.  If you enjoy his popular hits, chances are you'll like this CD.
B00B3HJMLM|2.0|I had high hopes for this album.  T&L was good from start to finish... this album starts off flat and never recovers.  It's not terrible, it's just like comparing &#34;Back to the Future 3&#34; with the original.  :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally awesome and completely addicting game!!!! If I played this game every day I would never get anything else done!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found parts of the novel unrealistic. Like how Mr. Grey is so utterly \\"perfect\\", though I am aware of his internal struggle. However, Grey does seem to be good at EVERYTHING, annoyingly so. Grey remains a mystery throughout the novel, which was a welcoming change. The book was a bit too saucy for me, if you know what I mean. Haha.  Ana on the other hand pissed me off to extremes. She is so unmistakably modeled after Bella Swan it's painful. Yes I did expect to see  a similarity between the two, Fifty Shades of Grey being a twilight fan fiction in its early years after all, Although I didn't expect to make the references so quickly. Ana is clumsy at first, but then show little to no signs of her clumsy behavior, but mentions being clumsy all the time. There is, however, her clumsy mouth that never stops. Ana also talks like she has a split personality disorder. She talks about her inner goddess all the time as well as her self conscious (which is different from her inner goddess and submissive self). Also, there seems to be information missing. I see that I can handle reading a novel and note information that was brought up in the beginning of the novel. However, as you are reading the author either forgot to include information or didn't make it evident enough in the beginning to seem important or note worthy, which ends up making you confused when random, or seemingly random, information comes out of no where.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there were parts that I enjoyed. I enjoyed the relationship and how protective and how entranced they seemed to be with each other. I also feel like I was able to take SOMETHING away from reading this book. Ana' s mother gives some good advice in the novel and, though the whole S&M thing makes me uncomfortable, there are other parts of the novel that actually has some insightful information.<br /><br />Though I did not love the book, I found that I couldn't put it down. 3/5 stars
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love all of Studio Ghibli movies. Plan on buying more in the future. Great film and wonderful for the whole Family.
1478230096|3.0|I was expecting a very basic retelling of the story; what arrived was pure summary, virtually no story.  But I can use this down the road as I am a teacher....Oh well....
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is one movie I totaly love. it is a total master piece. Just cant stop watching it. The Family loves it, I plan on buying more Studio Ghibli movies in the future.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really got into this book. There were so many twists and for most of the book, I was on the edge of my seat. However, I really hated the end. Really hated it. Is there a second book?
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the reminder and ideas of what I have viewed and can then go back later to research the items further.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|A must watch Movie. and in Blu-ray is so much more stunning. please watch this and you will see. I received this DVD fast and without trouble or damages I would recommend this seller. I would buy another DVD that i am interested if this seller had it. A++++ Thank you
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Works as good as $3 battery that I was buying from local store. Here I get 5- more than I need for the price that is lowere than $3!<br /><br />I put them in my garage door opener and so far they are working fine.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I would have given it three stars, but most horror movies aren't that good anyway, and this was actually quite scary. I just thought the ending could have been a little better.
1609611543|3.0|We don't get any truth out of the government, but I wondered if the Genetically altered wheat is as bad as this man says.
B006AX6ONI|1.0|So, I'm a Mark Cuban fan. I enjoy watching his negotiations on Shark Tank and envy him as a businessman. This \\"book\\" however, doesn't provide much substance. It's just a bunch of blog posts pasted together and called a \\"book\\". Editing is somewhat poor, and the reader is left with a few good tips here and there. Overall, I wouldn't recommend paying 2.99 for this title. It should really be offered for free.
B002XZNHG4|3.0|I'm not American, so I don't have the emotional association many have with this movie.<br /><br />The movie is about self discovery, not about love. For the most part, it left me feeling empty. Can't say I would watch it again. But, it was really nice to see a young Diane Keaton be a hippie and that relationship and social dynamics haven't really changed.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Essentially the way the writer fills out the characters, descriptive and relatable also the Mars geography. This is no Star Trek Universe. I'm expecting a Google map of Mars.

B003XT60KO|5.0|The lessons articulated have been directly repudiated by the Democrats and the majority of the public that has chosen to remain ignorant, and controllable; while the Republicans merely pay lip service to these lessons.  In short, politics in America have been bought and paid for since Coolidge by the use of Kebeysian policies. This book puts everything in perspective with simple, easily understood concepts anyone can grasp, if they wish!
B003FBMS4W|5.0|Without a doubt the best John Wayne western and probably the best western of all time. Should have earned &#34;Duke&#34; his first Oacar.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Well, I'm one of those who wish books could be written without profanity.  Is it really necessary?  I have read some of his books in Readers Digest Condensed Books and I much prefer them to the unedited version.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|Sure, this album is better than most of the pop junk released annually but in the Americana/folk genre, it doesnt hold a candle to the Giving Tree Band. Check them out, you will not be disappointed (or bored, which I found the Lumineers to be).
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is the first time I've read Maggie Stiefvater, I loved her style.  The story kept drawing me in to where I could not put it down.  I'll buy the other books in the trilogy.
B002APU580|4.0|This was a well-done movie, pretty much all around. In the beginning, it was a little slow, but as it went on it got better. I loved it in the end. I highly recommend for any and all who enjoy a good romance.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|Ah, yes, Firefly.  I read many of the critiques before buying this series and was pleased to see so many had rated it with 5 stars, so I bought the entire series. The story moved quickly and there were certainly no “draggy” parts at all; it was an entertaining, swashbuckling tale not unlike Robin Hood-style pirates in deep space and the actors did a fair to good job.  As far as the story line, I would rate Firefly with 4.5 stars.<br /><br />HOWEVER….<br /><br />As to how they had the characters all outfitted and the soundtrack, I would rate Firefly with ½ star only.  The Director, Joss Whedon was quoted saying, about the collector's edition of Serenity, on his thoughts of Firefly…called Firefly &#34;one of the best shows I've ever seen, by a country mile”.<br /><br />It was? Why? I didn’t see that. Trust me, dear reader,  there are so very many that are far, far better movies than this one! Sorry, but I certainly have to disagree with Mr. Whedon.  Of course, his comments seem likely, as he IS trying to get us to buy the more expensive collector’s edition of Firefly which I would not even think of doing.<br /><br />The story line was okay, and the ship “Serenity” was okay, but it ends there. The clothing, soundtrack, form of dress, mannerisms and weapons used in the story were CRAPPY and completely unbelievable, to put it mildly. The setting of the story line is supposed to be 500 years into the future from what I read in the synopsis. If this is the case, then what in the world were the writers thinking when they had all the actors armed with antique weapons and mimicking old 1960’s westerns? … Zoe, for example, was armed with what appears to be Steve McQueen’s old weapon, the cut down old .30-30 Winchester from “Wanted Dead or Alive”.  Good grief! Other characters were armed with old revolvers, AK-47’s and old lever-action .30-30 Winchesters! Really! This would be very much like a crew today of a cargo ship on the high seas moving cargo from port to port, wearing the armor of the conquistadors and armed with old black powder matchlock archebuses or crossbows of the 13th century. The weapons used by the characters were those that one might find in a museum in the year 2512. Further, the characters had handguns strapped down low, like the old Hollywood gunfighters, and it looked downright silly.  This, along with the knee-high boots, slickers from “Once Upon a Time in The West” and a music soundtrack right out of “Deliverance” ruined the entire show turning it into a fantasy an eighth grader writing this for an unwanted English assignment.<br /><br />Come on, people! Sorry to say, we are no longer in the seventh grade and starved for anything at all to watch.  At least hire someone in the costume department who has an IQ higher than the number of his/her fingers and toes who has an idea what the hell they are doing.
0316228532|2.0|This ain't no kids book ... so its not as bad as all the harry potter fans say it is however, its probably not worth your time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is better than temple run but u should add more and better things to it like ropes and adventure
B000I14UTS|3.0|the story leaves you hanging at the end. You never know if the main character made it out of Germany alive or what the end was...

B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really love this game. One of my favorites. Easy to use and quick to learn but different every time. Fun to break your old time record. Good one! Works great no problems at all with it.
B004SIP8BG|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted movie! The best way to watch it is with the subtitles and then watch it again to see what you missed.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever, it's totally worth the cost, and I highly recommend it to anyone!
B009GEAPYW|3.0|preferred a movie with actors, or graphics that matched the comic... I truly enjoyed the comic book, a lot of fun to read from an old batman fan

B00A0SKFLG|5.0|as good as the original, even with the actor and story line change.. fun and entertaining.. which is what movies are supposed to be.
0312117337|5.0|I own only a few decks, not a collector.  I bought this one for the artwork and the feel when I read about it and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />First, the deck arrived from Amazon factory sealed in cellophane but randomly organized (pre-shuffled)along with the booklet.  Google image the deck name if you want some samples of the cards and the commentary.<br /><br />The suits are Fire, Water, Clouds and Rainbows<br />Each card has a word or phrase -- I did a quick \\"out of the box\\" three card reading asking about (1) where I am now --  Source<br />(2) the project I'm working on --  Possibilities<br />(3) anything else I should know  --  Suppression<br /><br />All, right on.<br /><br />Bottom line, I really like this deck.  Look at images of several decks and choose one that speaks to you, no matter what anyone else says.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|the technology was really cool, acting was well done, and the story line was superb... entertaining as a movie should be
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I give Requiem 3.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />I struggled with how to rate the final book of the Delirium series, Requiem.  I loved the trilogy as a whole but the third book I've had mixed feelings about. At times the pace felt slow and the story seemed to stall. It was nice to see Hana's POV along with Lena's in alternating chapters and then the mix together as they met up once again. The ending left me baffled though because I felt like there had been no actual ending at all!<br /><br />Things I liked about Requiem:<br /><br />We get a surprise as to who is alive (and I don't mean Alex)<br />We get a glimpse into Lena's life. How the cure has changed her but not changed her entirely into someone emotionless.<br />Alex is back (though technically that could be from things I liked about Pandemonium).<br />Hana's secret about Lena & her sneaking around to find Grace. It made her a stronger, three dimensional character.<br /><br />Things I didn't like about Requiem:<br /><br />Even with Alex being back, I felt he was under utilized. Yes there's a mix of emotions since she's with Julian but I felt we were missing a dynamic that had been in previous books.<br />The plot felt at times in Lena's POV didn't progress anywhere. Constantly they were on the run from one camp to another. It took too long to get to Pippa's camp and break through their camp at home. The suspense came much too late.<br />The ending. I didn't feel like there was a solid conclusion and instead left the trilogy too open ended, including in the Lena/Alex/Julian department. As well as what happens to society.<br /><br />As a story on it's own, I wouldn't recommend Requiem but as a trilogy and the final installment of Delirium, every fan will want to find out what happens. The only problem is after you've finished reading it, you still don't have any more answers than when you started.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Second time seeing this, even more fun than the first as you look at the details of the movie, very well done

B00AE2J5HI|5.0|After seeing this film, I got, and watched everything Tom Hardy has been in.The story line was a bit uneven but, at its core, this is truly a great film. Five stars. Without the Shia and his girl-friend bit, it would have been even better. Btw, what ever happened to Gary Oldham's character? Intense and well worth it, despite loose ends. Bravo.

0062014536|5.0|There comes a time when all book series must come to an end. REQUIEM is \\"the end\\" for the Delirium trilogy by Lauren Oliver. Love it or hate it, this is it. This reader falls into the \\"Love it\\" category. Let me explain why.<br /><br />Yes. This is THE END. Nothing is more clear than that in the final pages of what has come to be one of the most thematically inspiring trilogies I have read since The Hunger Games. Surprisingly enough, the series didn't exactly \\"grip\\" me with its first installment, Delirium, which I gave merely 3 stars. The score was a bit of a shock since I absolutely adored Lauren's debut, Before I Fall. In the sequel, Pandemonium, I became more absorbed in the world she had imagined for our future. I connected with the main character, Lena, much more than I had expected to and I wondered how (or if) her issues would ever be resolved. Is it all resolved in REQUIEM? Does it even matter? That is in the eye of the beholder.<br /><br />In Pandemonium we learned more about what was going on behind the scenes in the walled cities. With the knowledge gained, we now join both Lena (an uncured) and Hana (a cured) to mesh together their two perspectives and two worlds within the Delirium series. REQUIEM is less about love, which is the controlling force within the cities, and more about fighting for a world that neither of these characters truly understands.<br /><br />Though we follow these two character's in their seemingly narrow perspectives , it is through them and their individual encounters that we see the world in a much larger scope. This story is no longer only about them and their short little lives, it is now about everyone; those whom they meet along the way, those already lost, those not yet born, me, you, everyone.<br /><br />I love how REQIEUM is told as one quarter Stepford Wives + one quarter Band of Brothers + one half Survivor. We question the livelihood of the people in both \\"worlds\\". We find ourselves wondering if it would be best to keep these worlds separate or to free those who would be controlled. But is the \\"freedom\\" in fighting for \\"what's right\\"? Or is the \\"freedom\\" in never even having to worry? Yes, we actually ask such questions. Do we really want to see the people free once again? Would the world even be the same after the battle has been won? ...If the battle is even won at all.<br /><br />There is a message to be had in this series, and it is how you perceive that message that will determine your overall enjoyment of REQUIEM.<br /><br />I could provide a detailed discussion on how I feel about the character, Hana. I would even share my thoughts on the Lena, Alex, Julian \\"love\\" triangle. But in the end, all of that seems rather insignificant. Along the way, I found myself letting go of the character's own concerns and focusing more on the overall impact of Lauren's words. I found nuances within the two character's perspectives that could be held true in our own world today. What in life is worth fighting for? Do we even have the guts to get up and do what's right? Why should we even care?<br /><br />As hard as it is to answer these questions today, it is even more difficult in a world as corrupted and confused as the one Lauren has created. While I am sure she was not out to write a life-changing novel, I do see a novel that speaks directly to each and every one of us. REQUIEM is a novel that speaks us intelligently and allows for personal interpretation. Yes, it may even make you think. A little. If anything, it will definitely grate on your emotions.<br /><br />If you can forget about the characters and see the masterpiece that Lauren has created through brilliant plotting and writing, you will find that your enjoyment of even the final few pages of this trilogy will increase ten-fold. All in all, and in my honest opinion, REQUIEM is a daring end to what has turned into a stellar dystopian series. One that I hope will be remembered.<br /><br />REQUIEM will surely be hitting my top tenlist of books in 2013.list of books in 2013.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|No complaints here, really! It's a great time-killer, and the tournament mode really provides a challenge! Definitely getting my money's worth out of this app!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Is very cool but u have to pay for all of it and u only have a couple things to do
B003MC5N28|2.0|I didn't like the Giver because it was boring and I found it hard to<br />hold my attention.  I am glad I am done with that  book.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|THIS IS TRULY A GREAT PRODUCT IF YOU THINK NOBODY WOULD USE THIS TRY IT AND YOU WILL BE AMAZED BY THE EASE OF USE AND MOST FRINDS AND FAMILY ARE ALREADY USEING IT
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app. I love being able to pin on the go, no matter where I am. Many times I have been in the grocery store and think of a recipe I had pinned. I pull up the app and find the ingredients I need. So simple to use!
B002ZG974M|5.0|It's hard to pick your &#34;favorite&#34; baby story in this, but I think mine is the baby in Mongolia. The soundtrack is lovely as well.
B008KE3960|4.0|Like tha game great for times when dont have Wi Fi and need something to do easy to play and fun
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I love these guys. They write with such description you can just envision every detail in the turn of events. It ties together a lot of loose ends about Pendergast and his wife. I can't wait for th enext one.
B005R32L66|4.0|Was able to download Skype to my tablet to enable calls to friends while using it. Being an inexpensive tablet was surprised that it works so well. Have the Coby Kyros which is a good basic tablet
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I'm only a few episodes into the first season, but I'm totally diggin' it so far.  I think the characters are interesting and the story hasn't been formulaic.  Looking forward to watching the rest.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Great, handles everything very well and although I can't say it is cheap for its performance it does perform well for its price. Very fast and it is very hard to find anything that even uses 80% or more of this CPU's capacity.
B001EC3JME|5.0|Bought this to use with my Energizer 2AA LED flashlight which is a little larger than a mini mag LED and it works great. Little tight at first which made it hard to get in and out but after about two weeks of use it loosened up and works great now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book so much and I would definitely recommend this to anyone it was the best Nicholas sparks book I have ever read. He is an amazing writer and I am excited to read more of his books! I read this book In a weak and I usually take  few weeks to Finnish  book but I could not put this  one down.
1616550414|5.0|Love it! Great quality and awesome high definition pictures! A must have for any Legend of Zelda fan! :) :)
B007SYWFRM|1.0|An interesting game in concept but flawed in execution. As other reviews have pointed out the real currency of the game is not coins but acorns which are very hard to come by unless you buy them with real money. What this game needs is an exchange bank. As my villiage grew the game became boggy and with this latest release it has become so bogged it is nearly unplayable. Also they lost my friends list in the last update.  The touch interface on my Kindle is also buggy.
0446563048|5.0|I haven't read a book in a long time that I could just not put down. Maybe it's because I've spent the last month recognizing why the company I work for is failing, why their turnaround is so high, and why our customer service and employee morale is at an all time low. I was so happy to read how Tony and his team created his business culture. Dangling a carrot at an employee, or as one previous boss was accidentally overheard saying, \\"spreading some candy coated compliments around\\", does not work by itself to  create happy employees, which creates happy customers, which creates a successful company. Duh. Every day counts. Creativity, personality, recognition, and genuine concern for fellow human beings. Wow, what a concept. Why isn't every company out there developing this model?<br /><br />To those that claim Tony is not as successful as he's made out to be: He's happy, his employees, customers, and vendors are happy. It's a success. What is your definition of success?<br /><br />To those criticizing his book not being edited properly. Really? Seriously? Let's forget all the awesomeness and talk about that? Seriously (again), who cares?<br /><br />To those saying it's just a glorification of a company. Hmmm...did you actually read the book? If you did, do you understand the difference between having pride in something you've helped create and cheap glorification?<br /><br />To all those who think it's cult-like or creepy to hang out with co-workers. What if you took your family and your closest friends and ran a business together? Would it still be creepy to hang out with them outside of work? Why is it so hard to imagine actually liking your co-workers? Especially when you let your personalities shine through, embrace diversity, and have fun together while at work.<br /><br />Well, enough of that.<br /><br />Way to go Zappos.com. I sincerely do hope this is the wave of the future, and to further the model by making all companies authentically eco-friendly, and non-profit orientated. Wow, what a brave new world that would be!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really cool game. I love the motion of the horses they've certainly gone through the trouble of making it realisric looking.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This fits my 7&#34; Kindle perfectly and fulfills the stability and protection I wanted added to it. Of course the color (black) makes it easy to keep clean, but if you do get something on it, it is very easy cleaned, just a damp rag. Also the kindle feels very secure in it, so no worries of it falling out if I'm carrying it wrong.The only thing I would change and not a big deal really to me is that I wish there were a couple of &#34;wedges&#34; or &#34;grooves&#34; that the bottom could fit into when used in the sitting position. It does have a little bit of slippage if not on a real sturdy base (like if I'm laying on my stomach on my bed reading). I hope that makes sense but you'll understand what I mean when you get it as I do recommend this product.
B0053JJLLC|3.0|I think we have all wondered what it would be like to be as small as an ant and live in the miniature world of insects. This book does a good job of this and adds a lot of scientific facts to go with it. This was a unbelievable ride but a bit fun at the same time.  A quick read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|WTF!!! I cant friggin open the stupid app:<br />piece of junk I tried more than 50 times now an it STILL WONT OPEN!
B009G7ZYPY|1.0|The orchestra and the arrangement overrides her voice. Seems as if they are trying to cover imperfections. Not what it is billed.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!!! Loved the characters felt as though I knew them. Would read it again and suggest this book to anyone
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Good and enjoyable book, very easy to learn and to practice English as second or third language for third generation foreigners.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This was the first John Green book I ever read.  I loved it! It kept my attention the whole time, I loved the adventure and it kept my heart racing until the last page!  Whether you've read any John Green books before or not, you should pick up Paper Towns because you wont be able to put it down!
B000FA5STS|5.0|As always Bladacci gives what you expect ... lots of twists.  I have read all of his books ... this one is one of the best!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Upgrading from an i7 860 this processor was a no brainer for me. I always turned off hyperthreading on my i7 due to it not being used by any games & allowing me to overclock further without it, so an i5 was the obvious choice when I went to upgrade. I'm running this processor @ 4.8GHz while cooling it with a Corsair H80 & it's trucking right along.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This film offers incredible, non-stop action and just flies by. Terrific Blu-ray picture and sound. Daniel Craig continues his darker, edgier Bond characterization that at times seems more villainous than the real villain, the urbane Silva (an excellent Javier Bardem). Being an old Bond fan and not trying to give too much away, the loss of a major character was less painful than seeing the destruction of the iconic Aston-Martin DB-5. Really cringed at that. A great addition to your movie collection and money well spent!
B000F39M9W|5.0|Great recording and performance.  The SACD layer is especially good and I like Mussorgsky's original orchestration of Night on Bald Mountain even better than Korsakov's.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|me gusto el producto,es justo lo que pedi y lo que decia el anuncio, es muy buena calidad y me llego a tiempo, felicitaciones  y gracias
0321857895|4.0|This book covers exactly the material it says it does; visual note-taking.  It also provides excellent examples from several people who use this technique.  I do wish there had been more material regarding basic drawing (as it is very germane to the subject of the book), but that's easy enough to find elsewhere.<br /><br />Aside from that one nit-pick, an excellent book, and a necessary one for the subject it covers.
B005SLS3VY|5.0|love the mystery with all the Micheal Connelly books and this saw no exception ....didn't want to put it down.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|My husband recommended this film to me, and when he described it as a film about Nazis from the dark side of the moon, I was suspicious that the film might be too off-color or camp for my taste. However, I found it to be a pleasant balance of satire, humor, and parable. I highly recommend.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book but it surprised me.  The book flowed easily and had a wonderful ending!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|bought for the 4 year old I babysit and he loves it. I think he plays on my kindle more than I do now.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app offers many different choices of noise and all sounds are authentic.  It is great for helping you sleep by blocking out other noises.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|Very long and a lot of boring parts but basically a good movie.  Good acting and great locations.  If you are bored and want something to watch it's an ok choice.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|There are so many different things to do on this app. It's a lot of fun. You can meet new people and see what they did with their horse.
031620157X|5.0|Awesome book,my kids could not wait to read more and more.  I have a 6year old son and a 9 year old daughter and they absolutely loved it!
B00A2V2OVK|5.0|The first season of Star Trek TOS is an excellent choice to those who are fans of Trek, or just sci-fi in general. After watching TNG, VOY, DS9 and ENT, it's really nice to go back and watch The Original Series to see how it all started (series wise, not cannon time wise). Needless to say, I loved the entire season AND series for that matter.
