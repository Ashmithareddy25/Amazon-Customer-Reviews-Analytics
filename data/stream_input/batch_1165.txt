B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Like all Jack Reacher books, this one is a fun read. If you've enjoyed Lee Child's other books in this series, you will enjoy this one as well. The formula is the same, Jack Reacher finds himself in the middle of a bunch of bad guys and as always, you find yourself hoping Reacher will give you a satisfying way to get even with them!  I enjoy the fact that Lee Child can portray a really bad guy without the 'F-Bomb\\" flying across the pages and a hint at romance without details. A \\"fade to black\\" works for me! I read these for the action and suspense, not for smut. Thanks, Lee Child!
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|This was a terrible movie.  The acting was atrocious, the plot was idiotic and the werewolf special effects made Twilight look good (if that's possible)! Save yourself an hour and a half of the life you have left and skip this cliche ridden, so-called werewolf movie. I could have used the $100 they paid the writer to \\"create\\" this farce!
386521584X|3.0|Why I don't rate this book with 5 stars?    Well, Robert Frank is not one of my favourites photographers, but if is yours, you'll love this book.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Even though this is a remake of an old childrens story, I think it it quite good, despite Rotten Tomatoes Review.  It keeps you guessing for the most part, but still has enough romance in it to keep those otherwise weary of watching it entertained.  Overall a good mix, I'll probably purchase the dvd!
1594744769|5.0|I don't go into plot detail in my reviews.  I don't want to spoil the adventure for anyone.  This book IS an adventure:  science fiction, time travel, fantasy.  Is is truly one of those worlds that, when opened, will stay with you.  I wanted to finish the volume in one sitting but restrained myself for I didn't want the book to end.  Mr. Riggs finished this story perfectly set up for a sequel.  I only hope that Mr. Riggs is working on that sequel right now and won't stop at just one.  WHAT AN ENJOYABLE READ!
0062060554|4.0|BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP is a most appropriate title for this S.J. Watson novel because I decided to read a few chapters before I went to sleep the other night.  As luck would have it, this meticulously plotted tale was so engrossing that I did not get to sleep until I had turned the last page at 3 A.M.<br /><br />This is the story of Christine, who upon arising each day has no memory of her life before that day and must rely on her husband Ben to fill in the blanks.  Some have compared this tale to movies such as 50 First Dates, and Memento and I will admit there are some similar thematic elements; however, Watson's version includes some intriguing components that seduce you into entering Christine's world, a world where memory loss is so complete that our protagonist is unable to even recognize herself in a mirror, let alone distinguish and respond to those around her.  The very thought of losing all the memories that define our lives and our identity is a terrifying one.  How would each of us deal with it and more importantly, who would we trust to enlighten us as to how we came to be in this predicament and recount to us the intimate details of the past 40+ years of our lives? How could we discern if they are  telling the truth or merely \\"inventing\\" memories for us?<br /><br />I will not go into a further, more detailed synopsis of the plot for fear of disclosing details that may ruin this reading experience for those of you who decide to get the book and lose a night's sleep.

0071762345|5.0|As a business owner,  this book is just what I want.  it cleared up all the confusion I was feeling about social media.   Like 95% of small business owners, I'm so clueless about using social media for my business (I'm great at posting photos of my kids and me hiking) that I would not have even read any book on social media if I didn't know Dave (full disclosure - we're good friends, but no one is making me write this review, and I'm being 100% honest, which is easy in this case, thank goodness. Silence was always an option).  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the same man who machine guns concise tweets and posts all day long can also write long-form so engagingly and informatively. The book is easy to read, complete with useful action items at the end of every chapter, and loaded with real-world examples.  From Verizon Fios to United Airlines, practical stories of real-world online successes and failures fill the book.  His explanation and definition of how a company needs to be engaged with it's customers is worth the price alone.  It's part 21st-century marketing manifesto and part social media owners manual.  If Anthony Wiener had read the appendix on using Twitter, he might not be in trouble today.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|I should break this up into two sections:      1.) The Blu Ray review (quality of the movie)  2.) Brief Movie review (just a quick take on it)    First off, the Blu Ray of this movie is awesome!  Crystal clear, great sound and smooth.  Loved it on my plasma TV, but it looks even better on my friends LCD screen.  The scenes literally come off the screen and he does not have 3D on the TV!  Get this Blu Ray!  It deserves room on your shelf.    Next, a quick review of the movie itself.      I went to see this in the theater expecting it to be total trash and very surprised.  It's pure fun and very entertaining.  It delivers, period.  Yes, it has a few corny lines, but people, this is an fun action movie, not a love story, not a serious drama or theater.  You see this to have some fun.  I suspect there are many GI Joe fans that felt disappointed by this movie because they haven't grown up yet.  Yes those people that still have their action figures, the GI Joe underwear, or the action figure with the kung fu grip (ok that one is cool) and probably went to this movie looking for a serious GI Joe movie.  Come on!  Grow up!    For example, the entire action sequence in France was a blast in the movie theater and great on Blu Ray with surround sound!  The whole movie is just plain fun with great action, special effects and good imagination.    Is it perfect?  Hell no!  It's no Blade Runner or Empire Strikes Back, but what it is is just pure entertainment.  It has a high replay value and if you are a fan of action movie, this Blu Ray deserves room on your shelf.      And if you don't like it, then sell your copy on Ebay and go back to watching the old Gi Joe cartoons while being wrapped up in your GI Joe blanket, in your GI Joe underwear and have Mommy tuck you in with a Kung Fu Grip shot to the head ;-)    Really, just relax and enjoy the movie for what it is...fun!    I do hope that they keep the same actors and director for the next release and can't wait to see it!  They need to continue it.    Peace out everyone!
B001POX73C|1.0|UPDATE: I was just reading the comments on my review these several years later (never saw them before now) and thought they were pretty funny ;). As it turns out, I just had a bad Kindle edition of the book, and punctuation, sentence breaks, paragraph breaks, etc. were nonexistent. And, bottle of wine (or no) - that makes for tough reading.   I have read tons of books, from all genres. I studied English and Journalism in college, and have been to writing workshops. This book is horrible. I couldn't make it past the first chapter. I am astonished that it got such good reviews.  My major complaint is lack of consistency. In the first scene the author jumps from POV to POV and it's difficult, if not impossible, to tell who's telling the story, or who's who. Also, the heroine, appears, then disappears, then mysteriously reappears in the same room as her potential suitors? It doesn't make any sense. They're talking about her like she's not there, but she is, but she seems to not know what conversation has happened before that point regarding her past, even though she never made and exit or a following entrance. HUH?  My second big complaint is the dialogue. It doesn't flow at all. And the author ends almost every sentence of dialogue in an exclamation point! So you're constantly reading sentences that seem like people are yelling at each other! And it's not just a couple here and there! It's like every other one! It was giving me a headache! I think you get my drift.  If this was the author's attempt to be humorous through grammar/writing style, by having her character dialogues make no sense and have them constantly screaming at each other - I'm not amused.  Rarely has a book that I've read been this poor that I felt the need to leave such a review. But I just felt incredibly misled by all the good reviews.  PS: As a side note I noticed that another person reviewed that the formatting in the Kindle edition is terrible, which may have led to why I had some much trouble with syntax and content. I will be asking for my money back as well.
B00062RCBW|5.0|To have all 7 seasons in the way Paramount envisioned it's release to be .. PERFECT.  I love the design and care that were given to this particular release.  I have seen the neon green re-release.. and can say I don't care for it.  I would love to have the bonus disc.. however, I am quite pleased with the original set.  From the horror stories of the green cube..  this set 'feels' like the series was given it's due justice in presentation and packaging.  I would say anyone who has a serious interest in either this set or the green cube are serious fans.. or from China bootlegging copies and selling them at price(green box).<br /><br />Why Star Trek is awesome to me.  I watched the original series and found them entertaining. While growing up for the most part it was Star Trek TNG. As a critical reviewer earlier states Star Trek tackles many issues in society today and yesterday and maybe possibly the future.  I always felt I learned something about myself after watching an episode.  Captain Picard and the crew had a wonderful chemistry throughout the show against good storylines as a backdrop for their cast characters. I've watched BSG, Caprica.. and some Star Gate.. to each his own.  I personally believe that Star Trek TNG really is much more sophisticated.  I had a friend who was putting down TNG.  He called it a sissy show.  He told me BSG was way better.  You know, throughout the show for BSG I was on the seat of my pants.. I thought BSG was amazing! Yet in the end I still feel that Star Trek TNG offers more of an intellectual experience.  BSG is more drama, action, emotion and struggle. It was good for the moment and was exciting.  Star Trek TNG makes me scratch my head.. and wonder.. and gives me that warm fuzzy feeling when done.  Now that I have my silver boxes.. I can once again sit back in my chair.. possibly have a cup of earl grey and enjoy one of the best sci-fi shows to date.<br /><br />In terms of quality.. season 1 and 2 are a bit hard on the eyes.. however if you're a nostalgic type you may find viewing them not as hard.  Like an old VHS tape from the 80's.  After season 2 the film quality is good quality and throughout.  This is a series I will love and cherish.  I personally detest the thought of receiving a possible bootleg.. I am sorry for my fellow fans who desire the bonus disc and chance to be taken advantage of.  Once again to each his own.<br /><br />7/22/11 *UPDATE* THIS IS MY BEST AND MOST ENJOYED PURCHASE FROM AMAZON!  I WATCH THIS SHOW EVERYDAY NOW.. I STILL THINK OWNING THE GREEN CUBE IS THE WORSE THING ANYONE CAN DO TO THEMSELVES.  STILL GLAD I DIDN'T WAIT TO PURCHASE THE BLU-RAY TO HAVE IT NOW IS WITHOUT QUESTION.. ~ IF YOU READ THIS YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THE INDIVIDUAL SEASONS AND GET IT AT A LOWER PRICE THAN THE ASKING PRICE OF THE RETAILERS NOW ~u're a nostalgic type you may find viewing them not as hard.

0812973992|5.0|When I heard that this book won the National Book Award, I cheered. \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is deserving. It respects language. It honors story. It finds beauty in the smallest of moments that seem anything but beautiful at first glance. It drew me in just as Philippe Petit, the inspiration for this book, drew people in with his tightrope walk between the Twin Towers. I had to read on. I had to see how it would be done. It rivals for originality my other two favorites this year---\\"Dead Boys\\" and \\"Winter's Tale.\\"

B0045I3EJC|4.0|Came in promptly and in new shape as it instated. A little too pricy for this dvd since its not a blue-ray disc.
B001JNNDEW|5.0|Excellent movie and it is a must see classic, especially if you have a job as an office worker. You will see the extra humor in the movie since it is easy to relate to. Some may think it is an exaggeration of the norm but you'd be surprised at what goes on in a regular office cubicle job.

B004I4H8QS|4.0|I have one of the remasters from the 90's, which is what my ears were used to. Obviously, listening to this version was a bit different in terms of the mix, but it's certainly clearer.    HOWEVER, my question concerns the song \\"Keep on Growing\\"...at about 24 seconds in, there's a quick break where Clapton shouted \\"Whoahhh!\\" On this 40th anniversary edition, that shout is completely gone!    Was that something \\"edited in\\" for the 90's master? Was it NOT on the original vinyl?    Update: NEVERMIND...I answered my own question by breaking out the turntable + vinyl. It turns out the 90's version (which contained Eric's shout) was a \\"remix\\", including vocals, guitar bits, etc that the band had recorded but NOT included in the original release. This 40th anniversary edition is like the original vinyl release, albeit with better sound quality.
B003L20ICE|1.0|Maybe heterosexual people like this movie? I'm unsure, but being a true lesbian myself in a committed relationship I saw this film over dinner with my other and our straight girl-friends; we were all horrified at how the plot twisted and turned. The stereotypes that were played out and the fact that the main character sleeps with a man - or no reason really was ridiculous. (Not realistic what-so-ever to real life). We all were a bit upset we spent any amount of money to watch this movie. I do love the actress Moore, but she wasted her talent here.
B001AXOFS4|5.0|Adele's 19 is a soon to be classic. Her throaty voice and soul filled lyrics make this album a great straight through listen. If you dont have it, get yourself a copy!
0618918248|4.0|Like all of Dawkins books, a good read. I especially liked his clarification of atheism versus agnosticism. This book may change few minds, but should be a very entertaining read for both the follower of religion and the atheist. Importantly, it is well infused with the intelligent Dawkins humor.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is my favorite horror film! Its somewhat humorous, and terrifying, with suspense, not alot of blood but enough for it to be one of the original slashers, AND some interesting characters. It came out in 1974, same time as Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it defiantly isn't as, well, gruesome! I thought it was excellent, mostly because it wasn't focused on a bunch of sex-crazed teens getting brutally murdered! Like Barb, for example, is hilarious! The movies about a crazy person in the attic of a un-suspecting sorority house-- and repeatedly caling the poor college students. Whenever he calls, you know someone has just died! This was awesome, and has a twist ending, im very proud to have it on my shelve!
B000SMWUPS|2.0|We really liked the idea of adding this caddy to our new stroller. The only part of the caddy that is rigid, in order to keep its shape, is a wire edge around the top. It broke the first or second time I folded the stroller. It's a little frustrating to unvelcro or take off the caddy every time the stroller gets folded. The elastic cup/bottle holders are great but you have to use two hands to get them in. As every mother knows, life is much easier when things can be done with one hand :) I will be looking for something to replace it.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|this novel is eye-opening.  we tend to view others from our own perspective, but Mr Haddon has been able to show us that there may be many times when our perception is completely off.  motives that we assign to the actions of others because they would have been our motives could be entirely false.  we must realize that individuals are unique and we should give our fellow humans the benefit of the doubt
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|I was beyond disappointed with this book. From the reviews it seems like people really liked it, so I guess to each their own. I was bored to tears. It was all over the place, had terrible flow, and was just your typical crime novel with nothing innovative or even interesting to keep you hooked. I could not even get behind the main character and found him pretty empty and cliche despite the authors attempts to make him multidimensional. The only problem with not finishing it is I will never know who the Snowman is...but I think its pretty telling that I really don't care all that much.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I don't think I have it in me to play from the beginning again after my saved data just disappeared. lame
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I own a lot of flashlights, most of them are Surefire-sized lights, and smaller AA and AAA lights. The TK41 is the biggest light I own, it is a \\"traditional\\" flashlight size, like the old 2D Ray-O-Vacs, which I like.  What I like;  -Side clicky switch; I'm tired of the rear-clicky on most tactical lights, side is much easier to use  -Nice heft and feel, I like the size  -Great build quality, very solid. The emitter in mine is off-center, but that does not seem to affect the beam  -Incredible thrower! This thing puts out more light on Turbo mode than anything I own, and it is a pretty generous-sized hotspot  -I use Eneloops in it, but I like that it will take AA's if I need to  -Very low mode that is supposedly good for 270 hours runtime.  -On High (as opposed to Turbo) you have all the light you usually will ever need  -Tailstands nicely  -Waterproof (tested mine underwater)  -It will light up the night, for a long distance!  -You don't have to mess with the blinky modes if you don't want to.  -Nice white beam at the hotspot. Corona is somewhat greenish indoors against a white wall, but  you will never notice that outside.  -Comes with extra \\"O\\" rings and a nice lanyard, in a nice plastic carry-case.    What I don't like  -Expensive (but worth it)  -A little tricky on how to get into the blinky modes, but I don't use them so does not matter to me.    This thing will not disappoint you
B001W6RRNY|5.0|Built to Last is a must have book for anyone in business. This book emphasizes the top business' that have survived the depression and other historical set backs. The median for opening their business' was 1902. It also looks at their core values which are the foundations for their business decisions. Visionary organizations are the theme or key to these successful organizations.  MUST HAVE BOOK KEEP FOR REFERENCE.
B004UHF51S|5.0|I still remember the day I first listened to Passionfruit, Michael's album from 1983. I hadn't heard such a culmination of subtlety, sophistication, coolness, sublime passion, and warmth in any music until then. After that, I purchased every single album from Michael. While I really liked them all, Passionfruit continued to have that very special place in my heart.  You can imagine my surprise when I realized that Time Together, Michael's new album, would become Passionfruit II for me. It's all there (except Steve Gadd, maybe), and it's my favorite MF album in almost 30 years. Every song is incredibly beautiful and sophisticated, and as usual for Michael, the production is top-notch.  This is just my humble personal opinion, but for me, Time Together is a true masterpiece I wholeheartedly recommend to any MF fan and to anyone looking for a perfect summer soundtrack. Hats off to the Gauguin of songwriting!  Roland (37) from Germany (where, sadly, a dachshund is rarely seen these days)

B00000K31Q|5.0|Excellent performances by every member of this movie's cast, including the late Heath Ledger.  Comedy and a rare depth of emotion in a teen flick, I enjoyed this as a high school kid and still find merit in it as an adult.  And I dream of running my classroom the way Mr. Morgan (played by Daryl Mitchell) does.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|While \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is the track you'll probably recognize most readily, I like \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" and \\"One and Only\\" just as well.<br /><br />Really good music.  Adele is a great talent with a rich and evocative voice.  You'll find yourself belting out the lyrics with her even at stoplights where everyone can see you!
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Definitely an upgrade over my Nikon SB-800 in features and power. The flash output on the SB-900 is more accurate than the SB-800, which tends to overexpose my images.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this for a trip that I was going on. I didn't want to take my laptop, iPad, and all the cables. I keep this in my camera bag and at the end of the day take the pictures I like onto my iPad. I do have the SD card so I don't know about the problems other people are having. But this is perfect for me, small and extremely easy to use. Made traveling a lot easier on me.
B004G600A4|3.0|FOR A FILM that's been in production almost as long, if not longer than, [[ASIN:B0034JKZ3G The Princess and The Frog]], the film formerly known as Rapunzel, Tangled, has nothing to show for it besides some really glossy animation and some impressive singing and acting from Mandy Moore. While Disney films are notorious for flipping copyright free fair tales or true stories on their heads with their vision or parody of how the tale should go, Tangled goes so far with this concept that it barely even has any relevance with the tale its based off besides the character's name, her impossibly long hair and the situation of being confined in a tower by an old hag that snatched her from her parents. (Originally she was taken by the old woman after Rapunzel's parents struck a deal with her. At least that's how it went in version I read by [[ASIN:0142301930 Paul O. Zelinsky]] (if I recall correctly) which everyone should pick up and read because its amazing).    ---- TANGLED begins with a disembodied narration of Flynn Ryder (or Eugene Fitzherbert) describing in witty detail how the circumstances around the girl known as Rapunzel came to be. At some unknown point of time, a \\"drop of the sun\\" from the heavens and landed upon a plant. And old woman, Lady Gothel, discovers it and learns that it grant her eternal youth if she sings to the plant. Meanwhile, the woman who would give birth to Rapunzel fell sick around the time she was supposed to be giving birth to her (I think) and the kingdom was at a loss as to how to help her. By twist of fate the kingdom's guardsmen come across the magical flower when Gothel fails to hide it properly in a rush to hide from them. The plant is then used as a medicine to revive the Rapunzel's mother and in no time she gives birth to a beauty baby daughter with sunshine hair.    Not long after her birth, Gothel sneaks into her bedroom and attempts to steal a lock of her hair, but upon cutting it the hair looses its magical qualities and thus Gotheldecides to snatch the baby in full and Rapunzel's parents are left grief stricken when their child is taken from them. Rapunzel lives the next eighteen years of her life in seclusion with \\"Mother Gothel\\", who fills the girl's head with fears of the outside world and the promise that everyone wants to chop her hair off. Upon the day before Rapunzel's birthday, a thief named Flynn Ryder steals the crown of the lost princess and double crosses his partner's in crime.     After a close encounter with a royal horse named Maximus (who, along pretty much all the soldiers in the kingdom, are hellbent on catching Flynn to the point of hilarious obsession), he comes across Rapunzel's tower, takes refuge inside and is promptly defeated by a simple whack to the head by Rapunzel's frying pan.    With Flynn as her captive (who fails repeatedly to charm himself out of her hair and out of the tower, quite literally), she strikes a deal with him. He is to take her out of the tower to see the magical floating lights for her 18th Birthday while her \\"Mother\\" is away from the tower. However, what was supposed to be a simple excursion outdoors and Flynn's meager a attempt to get his hidden \\"spoils of war\\" from Rapunzel, turns into a chaotic two(?) days when the kingdom's soldiers catch up with them and Mother Gothel returns early and finds her \\"Daughter\\" missing from the tower-----    For all intents and purposes, like [[ASIN:B004K4IZ3G Tron: Legacy]] after it, Tangled is in too much of a rush to get into the meat and potatoes of its storyline to focus on any sort of development for character or story (those healthy vegetables). While the Paul O. Zelinsky book allowed you to get to know the parents on some marginal level, Rapunzel's parents here are just voiceless characters akin to that of Aurora's parents in [[ASIN:B0013ND30M Sleeping Beauty]] near the end of that film. The voice narration at the beginning and the end is so rushed it leaves the viewer (or me) wanting more than what they got. You never create any sense of attachment for these characters, not even Flynn Ryder or Rapunzel herself. And the thing that killed the movie the most was the Dues Ex Machina ploy in which Rapunzel remembers her entire past life in a blurry montage via baby vision. Insult me why don't you Disney? I would've liked it better if someone had sat her aside after the crisis was over and explained her situation to her or better yet, have Gothel do that stupid Villain Monologue and accidentally slip the truth to her.    Rapunzel for all her perky adorableness falls on the short side of a interesting character. While is true enough that she's the true hero of the film and the only one that appears to get any sort of character development tailor made for all \\"Disney Princesses\\" of past generations (with the exceptions of Mulan, Tiana, Belle and Pocahontas who are true examples of characterization that don't fall on the \\"spoiled child learns her lesson\\" or \\"romantic, waiting for her prince to come [and rescue her]\\" tropes), the writing that surrounds the character never lifts her up to the Plato of the aforementioned female heroines. Mandy Moore's acting and singing on the other hand, are exemplary; the one scene that probably made me laugh was Rapunzel's constant back and forth of \\"BEST DAY EVER!\\" and \\"OH, I'M SUCH A TERRIBLE DAUGHTER!\\" when she finally leaves the tower for the first time.    While Zachary Levi's comic timing falls somewhere between excellent and bland, the character this movie's PR campaign spent so much time promoting to the masses, in hopes of garnering a larger male audience, is also not as hilarious as they would have you believe. Flynn Ryder's evolution to self-serving thief who'd double cross you in a heartbeat and further more attempt to slink his way out of the retribution that he's got coming, to the man who falls in love with Rapunzel and finds there more in life worth fighting for (besides stolen goods and the like) is just a non-event. The\\"romance\\" between Rapunzel and Ryder was so rushed and lacking of any real spark that I wondered why they even tried to begin with.     Their relationship never seemed to rise above the \\"cute friendship\\" as there is little to no development in their relationship (believable enough for me to buy it). The \\"death scene\\" wasn't even long enough to monetarily mourn the passing of Eugene because his revival happened almost barely five minutes after he got shanked by Mother Gothel. And while we're on the subject, Mother Gothel is probably one of the weakest Disney Villains in the entire history of their villains (unless I can think of someone else), with her only positive points being the design of her character. Also, her death scene was probably only second to McLeech (Rescuers Down Under) or Clayton (Tarzan) in the long line of lame \\"implied deaths\\".    Neither the horse or the tiny lizard (you truly DO forget is in the movie because he's that small) are funny as they should've been. I will admit that the begrudging truce subplot between Maximus and Flynn was amusing. However, most of the humor in this movie just got a chuckle and one or two laughs from me, everything felt terribly forced or too tried to be too witty for its own good; everything to the humor at Flynn's expense to the amended Will Smith line: [[ASIN:B00009V7OR \\"Oh, I've got to get me one of these!\\"]], just tried too hard to make you laugh. And the musical themes were terribly forgettable, which surprised me because this is a DISNEY MOVIE. They may not have hit the nail on the head everytime in the days of old, but to have a film that's COMPLETELY devoid of a memorable theme? That's a first! There wasn't a single lyric from the themes that I could remember after the movie ended and the DVD was out of the player. They never hit home with the emotions, the thieves song was just \\"there\\" killing time and the duet theme was especially bland outside of the complimentary vocal harmony between Moore and Levi.Overall, the best thing about Tangled is the CGI, you'll most likely spend more time focusing all the little details in the movement of the fabric and the character's expressions when they speak (exaggerated as they are). Whatever their intentions, Tangled lacks heart and it lacks a serious attention to detail for its story. Everything feels as though it just wants to get done and over with and as it stands this film is a major step down from The Princess and the Frog, which combined everything great and special about past 2D animated Disney films of the 1990s into one neat package. One that left a lasting impression on me. Tangled, on the other hand, doesn't even scratch the surface of \\"memorable\\" or \\"remarkable\\" outside of its technical achievements. [A 3 out of 5]
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I am finding myself playing this game way too late into the night.  This game is awesome.  Some said this is a lazy port, but they're just being picky.  I got it for free, but with the entertainment I've got from it, I would've paid 5 bucks easily.  Great graphics and hilarious.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Good book, but someone should make it clear to customers that there is sales tax from the publisher when you buy this book.
B003ES5ZPK|2.0|This item looks well made. The packaging is great. I could not use this item as it was too thick to fit my  Samsung TV. Otherwise I'm sure it would have worked as it was supposed to.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|There are a few shows on tv that should be watched Breaking bad being one because every season it gets better and better it doesn't just stay at a standstill. The other show? Dexter. I know this is a review for breaking bad but these are the two shows that should be watched by all because they are so well written and you just want more the minute the episode finishes.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|If you like Independence Day or District 9 you will have a blast watching this movie.  This is now my personal favorite science fiction film.  Non stop action from start to finish that left me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.  Comes highly recommended from me for lovers of science fiction.
1416550550|4.0|Loved the book!  I couldn't put it down.  I have to admit though, that I was a bit disappointed with the ending (I won't say why because I don't want to give it away).  I give it four stars instead of five, only because of the ending.    I'm looking forward to reading more books by Kate Morton.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Yes, it's long.  But it's so entertaining on so many levels that it's a relatively quick read.      Here are a few caveats and hopefully helpful hints:      1.  Don't skip the footnotes.  Some are merely definitional.  Many are short, but some are entire chapters.  Some are laugh-out-loud hilarious.  All are essential parts of the experience.    2.  I read the Kindle edition on my iPad, and found it perfectly suited for this book.  You get to the footnotes just by touching the footnote reference number.  You get to the footnotes' footnotes just by touching the footnote footnote reference letter.  And you get back to the text just by pressing \\"back to text\\".  You can use the dictionary function to look up words (which you'll surely need) by touching the word, and then get back to the book by pressing \\"back\\".  What could be easier?  With a book this heavy, trying to maneuver back and forth between text, footnotes, footnote footnotes, and dictionary would be exhausting.  You'd likely lose your place or miss something.  Also with a book this size, requiring so much flipping back and forth between text and footnotes and footnotes' footnotes, your arms may be so tired by the end of the book that you would not want to turn it over and start reading it again.  Barring physical exhaustion, you very well may want to do just that.         3.  If your spouse or significant other is a light sleeper, don't read IJ in bed.  Parts made me laugh out loud, and they usually were unexpected, coming, for example, at the end of a very long sentence, or at the beginning of a footnote.  My outbursts of laughter kept waking my wife, who tended to find the jokes not so funny when I read them to her, out of context and just as she was being yanked out of slumber.    4.  Unlike other lengthy novels to which IJ has been compared (e.g., Gravity's Rainbow), there is no need for a \\"companion\\" book (other than a dictionary).  This book has many arcane references, but DWF almost always eventually explains them.      5.  Don't get discouraged by the seemingly disjointed beginning.  DFW is telling many stories, about many people and many things.  Let him introduce the characters and themes, and let him let you get to know them.  Eventually you'll start seeing the connections as he begins to weave the threads together.        6.  When you get to the Eschaton Game chapter, put the book down unless and until you have a good, solid chunk of uninterrupted time to devote to it.  You are not going to want to stop in the middle of that chapter.  It is just too entertaining.    7.  If you're a real stickler for grammar, IJ will infuriate you.  Too bad for you, but don't even start it.
0062060554|4.0|4.5 stars form Fire and Ice  [...]  This is one of those books that fascinated me and kept me reeled in until the very end. Maybe it's because I have a degree in psychology and have worked with trauma victims, or maybe it's because the writing is so completely riveting.    It's the story of Chrissie a woman in her late forties who wakes up every day in a strange bed with a strange man who claims he is her husband. She has no recollection of how she got there or who she is, but when she looks in the mirror the reflection staring back at her is NOT what she remembered. She still feels 27 and what she sees is an old wrinkled middle aged woman. Her husband, Ben must remind her every day who he is, that they love each other. And the trickier part is that all the knowledge she gains within those 24 hours will be erased the second she closes her eyes and goes to sleep. Tomorrow the slate of her memory will be wiped clean. She'll once again have no idea who or where she is.    Enter in Dr. Nash, a neurologist who believes he can help her. He instructs Chrissy to keep a diary of everything she remembers each day. And little by little more pieces are coming back, but the front page of the journal reads DO NOT TRUST BEN. Her husband must not and does not know this journal exists. Christine's past is not fitting together nicely which leads us to the mystery and suspense of what memories are true, and what are false.    Before I Go To Sleep is an unsettling read as well as a peek into the personal thought process of central character Christine. She is written so believable and alive I had a hard time reconciling the fact the that he author, writing under \\"SJ\\", is really a man, Stephen. He has nailed the inner working of a middle aged woman suffering from a debilitating neurological condition and trauma. Perhaps that's why already this novel will be sold in 37 countries and a film version is currently being made. The story found its roots in the true story of HM, Henry Gustav Molaison, a memory disorder patient who was much like Chrissie, woke up his entire life, each day to a loss of memory.     This psychological thriller is fascinating, creepy and all around brilliant. Truly a stunning debut. It's definitely not for young adults or children due to graphic content, violence, sex and language. I would recommend it only to readers 18 and older. While I truly loved the plot, the premise and the execution, the bad language bothered me.
B004RX03NK|5.0|this band is amazing.  they keep getting better and better.  bought it about a month ago and have listened to nothing else but.  cant wait to wake up tomorrow and put on my headphones at work and hear 85 mins of rock solid, mega-epic music.  did i say this band is amazing.  I mean damn, my neck is sore.  do yourself a favor and buy this cd.
B004MNO0BQ|2.0|This game looks great, but the carom ttails your touch by about a third of a second, making it utterly unplayable. Google g2 phone
B0034G4ORM|5.0|GREAT GREAT GREAT!  None of those stupid one-liners, dialogue is kept to a minimum, very little unwarranted screaming, a aimple plot premise, and the action starts about 5 minutes into the movie.  Thank heavens it wasn't screwed up by studio brass and turned into a date movie.  It's a MAN MOVIE.  Blood & guts. death & destruction, guns & rockets, smoke & debris, and ONE LONG 100 MINUTE FIRE FIGHT!  NOW HOW ABOUT A SEQUEL Jonathan Liebesman (director) and Christopher Bertolini (writer)...Use your incredible skills to make the movie HIVE WARS (part of the Alien series) for the battle of Earth with those insects!!  Now that could possible top this movie!  JUST FANTASTIC!
0553805371|4.0|First of all, Hawking is a fantastic writer, in addition to being a genius.  He has the ability to present a complex subject in an understandable way.  This book is an extension of his previous work.  He paints a very complex picture with a broad brush leaving a lot of detail for others to cover.  He is clearly targeting the layman.  This book will cause the reader to think of the world, the universe and creation in a totally different way.  A very worthwhile read for anyone.
B004UA8D2S|2.0|The only reason it got 2 stars was because the the picture and audio quality were superb.    The movie itself is boring and annoying in a Aussie accent in a informercial type of way.    The 'Cave' genre is a pretty niche market.  Only one movie to really watch in this category and The Descent is the benchmark for claustrophobes and horror fiends.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|This film was very exciting to watch.  Is this film worth seeing?  Definitely!  How is the CGI since the movie has a lot of it?  Well the CGI is much better than I thought it would be. The CGI is better than most other movies.   This movie has a ton of CGI since it mostly takes place in outer space so it is good that it is decent.   How is the acting?   The best performances come from Ryan Reynolds and Mark Strong. Most of the other acting is good but of course it is not oscar worthy.  How are the special effects?  The special effects are what make this movie. They are top notch and outstanding.  How was the dialogue?  Dialogue is passable. It is decent but remember it is a superhero movie.  How is the directing?  Well the directing is above average. The movie flows nicely but there are a few problems in some parts.  Do I recommend you see this film?  Yes! I highly recommend you see it because it is just plain fun. Just go in and have a good time.    I do have just a few complaints with this movie. The character development in this movie was not as  deep as in other films. The story is not very deep but I was not expecting it to be. Lastly, the Green   Lantern was just a little too powerful. I would've liked to see him have just a little less power   but it is just my opinion. The Green Lantern franchise has a ton of potential and I can't wait to  see what they do with the Green Lantern.    Overall, this is one above average superhero movie. I know some people don't like superhero movies   because there are so many of them but give this one a chance. This movie impressed me and I hope impresses  you too. This movie is just plain fun and made for everyone to enjoy. This is definitely a great movie   especially if you like the Green Lantern as much as I do. I recommend this movie especially to kids but   also to anyone who enjoys superhero movies.
0756404738|5.0|Although its length could drive some readers back, I would recommend it. If you liked the first book, you will most probably enjoy this second one, and hopefully wait for the third to come out.    The quality of the book, its covers, text size... is perfect. However being a nearly 1.000 pages book also means having some difficulties for its reading, and sometimes may be uncomfortable.
B004DMIIOG|4.0|MINOR DETAILS BUT NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />First off let me say this was a pretty good movie.  It wasn't boring and it kept my interest throughout.<br />However, I think people are way too liberal on giving out 5 star reviews, which is the primary reason why I am making this review.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Interesting<br />- Good, fast pace (story wise)<br />-Dub seemed good.  Not over the top and having the actors try to emulate the Japanese VA's which almost always comes off as strange sounding.<br />- Very message about family ties.  However, it was not as heartwarming as I would have liked it to be since it did feel forced and not much development between characters.<br />- Beautiful animation.  Very nice combat scenes. Lively colors, etc.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- ABSOLUTELY NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.  It's hard to dislike the characters in this movie, but you just don't feel invested or connected to them and everyone is the same at the beginning of the movie and the end. I blame the fact that there are TOO many characters.<br />- I like the characters, but I felt that I was \\"forced\\" to like them.<br />- Corny.  Alot of the dialogue is very.....awkward.  NO one in real life would ever be able to pull of some of these lines.  The scene where the grandma wields that spear was probably meant to be emotional.  But it was just a \\"What the hell was that?!\\" moment for me.  I know this is an anime and I don't expect complete realism but...... this seems to be a \\"slice if life\\" anime but the things the characters do and the way they act don't seem realistic at all.<br />- Unexplained and rushed things.  I did not buy into Natsuki falling in love with the main character (not a spoiler.  This is typical of this type of story).  It just did not flow well and as a viewer I did not feel really invested in their relationship.  They didn't seem to be either, they barely even talked to each other.  Another example of the movie forcing things on us.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />It's definitely worth a purchase, it's not a bad movie by any means even with all the things I disliked about it.... but don't buy into the hype all these 5 star reviews generate or you will be disappointed.  Do not expect to be moved by this movie.  It's fairly entertaining but it won't spark much-if any- emotion.  Definitely check it out though, even if you just rent or borrow it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Ok, upon subsequent watches I do feel this movie is better than I initially thought.  I really appreciated the family aspect to it and there are a few really great moments.
006113399X|1.0|Too often people give five stars without any reservation. I probably would have given this a two, maybe a three, but some of these reviews, I think, are just too glowing. There are a few well written chapters - but so much of this book feels like a rough draft. 500 pages and little seems rewritten or worked on. Some of it is just lazy. And then the errors... some have been pointed out. South Africa didn't have a death penalty in 1999 (he couldn't have researched this better?), a \\"starter motor\\" that groans and dies. Starter motors don't do this when they fail. They go click click click and then nothing. The opening scene with the gun - magazines when it's a revolver. And why does he shoot? Why didn't he hold his fire until the man started shooting - assuming he would shoot. And then he gets a medal? It just goes on and on. I was dissapointed. I wanted to like this book and I found it very sloppily written.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a great book with relatable characters and believable story lines. I finished it in one night because I just couldn't put it down. Highly recommended for all ages not just young adult.
B00006I53S|4.0|I have been using this lens for 3+ years along with my XTi.  I definitely is satisfied with this lens as a general purpose lens.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Construction, USM=focus speed, picture quality is definitely better than a kit lens.<br />Having wider focal length serves better as a general purpose lens than a kit lens.<br />Having a wider focus ring makes it easier to manually focus than a kit lens.<br />Full time manual<br /><br />Cons:<br />No zoom lock.  When you walk around with this lens, it extends as there is not lock.<br />28mm at widest is not wide enough unless you are using full size sensor.  This is the biggest con for this lens for me.  I still use a film camera and it serves me well for film.  But with XTi, I feel this lens is not wide enough.<br /><br />Overall, this lens is a good lens in its quality and for the price.  But if you are using DSLR with non-full size sensor, you might want to consider a newer 18mm-135mm.
0765356139|1.0|I liked the first book.  Now I am on a torturous journey through book 2 -- nothing at all happens.  Vin and El are completely annoying. I'm sure the author is laughing it up over a beer he bought with my money, about how he screwed all his fans with Book 2 of the trilogy.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|A man feels empty and deals with it by becoming addicted to the endorphin rush of being the centre of attention (a rock star of politics).  But once a decade he gets into contact with his real feelings or soul (as symbolized by his relationship with a highly gifted and beautiful dancer) but his script or fate (the material in this unconscious or the adjustment bureau) tells him not to get too involved there, to ignore it and go on.  When our hero decides to question this, every memory within him (men with hats) chases him to return to his script which would be altered if he were to have contact with(in) the woman he loves.  A high quality movie with heart.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|Comment: You tell me there is a new \\"Scifi\\" movie... and I'm there. OK... so after watching this on my state of the art Samsung theater... this is a list before my thoughts. (1) Didn't get to see the \\"enemy\\" till late in the game. (2) Didn't get to see any (working) aliens close-up. (3) The aliens went to a hell of a lot of trouble for (liquid) water. (4) 90% of the movie was a (continuos) war scene. (5) The movie took a lot for granted with lots of liberties. (6) The ending was weak... really weak. So there you go... picking apart a movie that I liked... (once). It was very interesting to watch an area that I spent a lot of time at being used as a war zone. (Quad Rollerskating back in the day) It amazed me that after they found out the aliens \\"soft spot\\" they still shot at them as before. The human part of the film was soft and hokey. You tell me there is a new \\"Scifi\\" movie... and I'm there. 3 to 4 Amazon stars... This will not be a classic.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|Got this game and can't stop playing.  Fun fun fun, beat part is competing for the highest score in the online leader board.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|This very small flash does a decent job.  I use an SB900 as a rule, but when you are in tight quarters or just need a little fill flash...this flash does a pretty good job.  It will even rotate up so you can bounce light off ceiling.  Not bad for the price.  Also good for a novice shooter.
157421327X|1.0|If you've never seen anything at all about Zentangles before, then this book will teach you to do simple doodles. However if you've spent a couple of hours looking at the free websites that describe the common zentangle patterns, then you already know everything that is in this book. Don't waste your money or your time on this book. You'll be much better off reading the excellent tanglepatterns.com site.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Based on the true story of Aron Ralston and the book, \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\", published by Simon & Schuster (2004).    Aron Ralston is a outdoorsman and avid hiker. He is 27. It is a sunny day in April of 2003. Without telling anyone, he decides to go biking and hiking in Blue John Canyon in Utah. After meeting two female hikers and spending part of the day with them, he goes back to exploring. He steps on a 800-pound boulder that was suspended in a cervice. The boulder becomes loose and Aron falls deep down in the cervice. He is now between the rock walls with his wrist and arm stuck by the boulder. He can not get loose. The pain is incredible. He has a camcorder to record the hours and days he is stuck there. He reminds himself \\"not to loose it\\". It is impossible for him to be seen or heard...or found.     James Franco as \\"Aron Ralston\\". Kate Mara as \\"Kristi\\". Amber Tamblin as \\"Megan\\". Treat Williams as \\"    The real Aron Ralston makes an appearance as himself in he movie.     Alot of product advertising in this movie. McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Wendy's, Gatorade, Coca-Cola, Sunkist.    Movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Screenplay writing, Editing, Original Score, Original Song.      The real video recording of Aron's ordeal is locked in a bank vault for safety.  Only his family and friends and director Danny Boyle has seen it all.      I watched this movie on Amazon Instant Video On Demand. When you are finished watching movie, press the ESC button on your keyboard to return to your normal screen.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I am glad I gave this book a chance after reading in the book description about levitating girls and invisible boys.  Not only did I enjoy this engaging adventure I also enjoyed the pictures the author has collected for his brilliant story!
B0010OIN90|5.0|My cousin has 6 year old twins, a boy and girl. I bought a bracelet for the girl and was trying to find something similar for the boy and found this. he loved it, and enjoyed putting the little car it comes with together. Since they're so young it's also nice that the watch isn't digital so they can get used to telling time. I liked this one vs some of the others since the colors are too wild. The watch is easily adjustable by putting on or taking off links.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I really like this CD. Hearing Clapton cover these songs is really fun. While I don't love every one of them (i.e. My Very Good Friend the Milkman), I do like all of the songs. I particularly like Judgement Day, Can't Hold Out Much Longer, and River Runs Deep. In his autobiography, Clapton talks about being strongly influenced by the blues and blues musicians. It's fun to hear him cover blues and music from related genres too.
1594744769|4.0|The more I think about this book, the more I like it. When I was about ¼ into the book, it sunk it's claws into me. So much that I had to post the trailer for the book and gush about it a little bit, which I rarely do before I've read the entire book. I was dying to know just what the heck was really going on. I didn't have a clue what the reality of the situation was and it made me want to get to the end of the book. But at the same time I didn't want the mystery to end, so I know I will be rereading this one again.<br /><br />The main character, Jacob, is written so realistically, he didn't feel fictional at all. The photographs which were included throughout the story lent themselves wonderfully to the story being told within the pages. Each and everyone of the photos had an edge of creepiness to them. The location for the majority of the book was also detailed enough for me to picture it in my head, but not overwhelming to the point where I get bored reading about each blade of grass. I can't wait to see where the story goes from here and I really can't wait to see the movie once that comes out.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. It has a fantastic creepy feel to it and you get just enough troll to be satisfying, no more or less. The main character is really cool. The special effects are suprisingly good. Hollywood, please don't remake this. (I can see hundreds of super fake looking CGI trolls and a spec ops unit gratuitously firing machine guns and explosives, or a single troll with a bunch of semi-sentient teenagers randomly going off into the woods alone...)
0061122416|1.0|This was one of the most boring books I have ever read in my entire life. The story, in its entirety, could have been told in about 4 pages. Instead, the author repeats himself over and over and over again so that he is sure that the reader understands the importance of following his or her dreams. This book lacks any sophistication whatsoever and is more of the children's book than anything.
0596007124|5.0|The examples are sensational. Perfect ways to explain hard core technical stuff to us mere mortals. I wish every technical book had a head first version
0316098329|3.0|While I found this book to be very intriguing and really liked that it was from the perspective of a 5-year-old, I could not get over how much it sounded like recent news headlines. I liked how as the story went on, we found out why Ma did some of the odd things she did. I think the author could have done a little better with how the story ended. I'd be interested in a sequel to how the character do later on in life.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Love her music!!
0345529057|5.0|I came looking for these books after seeing the first two HBO episodes of GAME OF THRONES. I tried the library first...but what a waiting list. So...I decided to buy. I'm NOT sorry in the least. This four volume set has just joined my exclusive bookshelf of books that I read over and over and over...AND any time I add something to that bookshelf, I have to give away the same number of books to make room for the new item(s). So...four books have gone to the library's donation bin. The good thing about joining this exclusive \\"club\\" of mine: Once you're in, I DON'T have to give away anything else for new additions to a series. And I already have the 5th book in this series pre-ordered. YUM. I can hardly wait. One more thing: This are thick books. When the set arrived, I pulled an all nighter reading GAME OF THRONES. All of it. I don't do that anymore...I'm too tired the next day. But this one...well, there was no question...just one more page, one more chapter, gee is it really 6 am? Just one more...I read the other 3 more slowly. It took me 6 days to finish them.
B000683VI4|5.0|Thumbs up
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best series on TV only to be cut after one year.  The picture is bautiful the sound is great, the only problem is at the end of each show is all of the warnings about coppying the discs.
B000001Y5D|4.0|Does it really matter??? Its a great CD,that's all I have to say about that! Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok Ok..
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I generally don't like novels where the protagonists are somewhat unlikable, but this case it works. Very dark at times, but has a gritty realism that grabs you.
B000N3ST7K|3.0|Not bad
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|I thought this would be a lot of fun; nothing too complex, just a fun app to while away a few minutes while waiting for someone, or something.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as other reviewers have already noted, the controls need work.<br /><br />I didn't experience lag or misalignment issues, but the position of the paddles leaves a great deal to be desired.  Your home goal area is essentially one big blind spot.  Unless you can always keep the game away from the third of the screen closest to your goal (and on anything other than easy mode that isn't really possible for most players) you are relying on chance and will often knock the puck right into your own goal area.<br /><br />Fix the position of the paddles and this would be a five star app; fix them not for the rating but to increase the fun quotient of this very (otherwise) enjoyable app.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Eminem and Royce Da 5'9 have finally released their debut album under the name Bad meets Evil, with Bad being Royce and Eminem being Evil, some people may not realize but this album has been anticipated for over 10 years.  On the album The Slim Shady LP, Eminem and Royce did a collabo called Bad Meets Evil, and at the end of the track they say stay tuned for hell the sequel.<br /><br />However, we didn't think we'd ever see the sequel because Em and Royce had a falling out and weren't on speaking terms, so that idea was lost.  But around the time of Proof's death, they settle their feud, and even made a couple tracks together and with D12, and Em has even signed Royce's group, Slaughterhouse, to Shady Records.  So it was great news to hear that they were finally making their sequel, and it wasn't just one track but a whole EP, and it's amazing.<br /><br />This album sounds like a classic shady album, much different than Recovery, which I did like, but it was so much different than Eminem's normal sound.  Em and Royce go back and forth on each song exchanging raps, and they do a good job of it, everything seems to go together, they have a chemistry.  There are also guest appearances by Royce's group Slaughterhouse, Bruno Mars (which I think they could've done without) and Mike Epps.<br /><br />So here's a quick breakdown of my opinion of the songs:<br /><br />1. Welcome To Hell 4/5  great introductory track to the album, starting with Em saying \\"I told you we'd be back\\" I loved that.  I'm also glad they didn't have an \\"intro\\" I hate it when artists do that just get to the music that's what we bought the album for.<br /><br />2. Fast Lane 5/5 This is one of the strongest tracks on the cd, it's a toss up between this one and a few others as to which one is my favorite, there are just so many killer tracks, but this is definitely in the top 3.  The line about what he wants to do to Nicki Minaj was freakin hilarious.<br /><br />3.

Lighters 2/5 Another mainstream one, this one just sounds horrible next to the other great tracks, it doesn't go with any of them, but this will probably be the one you hear on the radio, and the radio sheep will probably eat it up.<br /><br />8. Take From Me 4/5 This one is pretty good, this one sounds a little more like a ballad, Royce does a great job on this track.<br /><br />9. Loud Noiss 4/5 Another great track, good beats, catchy lyrics etc.<br /><br />10.

When you get older and start hearing, or reading their stories, that's when you start to realize how heroic they are.  Thank you for allowing me to wake up safe and sound in my bed every day!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I never thought I would understand Pride & Prejudice enough to critique the film adaptations but some unexpected leisure in the past couple of months has allowed me to see them all. The 1940 Greer Garson is good - indeed all 4 are good although widely different. The Keira Knightly is the best, however, both because of her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, and because of the warmth of the film maker's conception of the Bennet family.  Of course it is the portrayal of Lizzy that makes or breaks the film, and this is my favorite portrayal, and my pick of the best of the 4.  Keira Knightly is my favorite Elizabeth. She is younger than the other actresses who have played Elizabeth,  and plays a Elizabeth Bennet closer to the 20 year old we read about in the novel. I would not call her beautiful - indeed in this film Jane is the most beautiful of the 5 Bennet sisters, just as she is supposed to be. But Keira is unbelievably attractive because of her facial expressions. She has a marvelous smile and we see a lot of it, and, like Garson, her face can show her emotions and their changes so well that soon you are completely engrossed in her character and her story. As they used to say, \\"You'll laugh, you'll cry, but you'll never forget Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Bennet.\\"<br /><br />This version also manages to allow Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) to be his sarcastic and witty self without being unpleasant. He is played too harshly in some other versions, especially the 1979 BBC adaptation.  The Bennet family holds together quite well, even Mrs. Bennet is redeemed, although with some dialog that is definitely not in the novel.  Darcy is almost impossible to cast, I suspect. Certainly in this film he is no better than acceptable. Mr. Collins, on the other hand, is very good, although his part is much cut down in the interest of getting a 2 hour film. (We do get to hear a short sample of his preaching). The only unhappy casting is that of Wickham. Wickham is a sociopath, and should have a great deal of charm when he meets Lizzy. Here he is more whiner than charmer. All 3 of the other film makers were able to find someone to fit the bill, but here Keira's boyfriend, I believe, got the part, and he is simply wrong for it. Luckily his role is also quite reduced from that in the novel so we don't see him often enough to be disturbed greatly.<br /><br />So, for those characters that survived the scriptwriter, this is the best cast of the 4 adaptations, and the most sympathetic to the Bennet family. Who is missing? Aunt Phillips and \\"broad faced stuffy Uncle Phillips, breathing port wine.\\" Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, Maria Lucas (well really, excepting Charlotte, Sir William and all the Lucases are missing), Mr. & Mrs. Gardiner's children are gone, although the Gardiners do get to take Lizzy to Pemberly, Mrs. Hill is gone, Mrs. Young is gone, and Mrs. Ainisley is gone,  as are all of the Officers from the ____Shire militia (we see anonymous officers dancing, but no Denny,  and no Col. Forster except by mention. We do not go to London with Jane, or Ramsgate with Georgiana, and never were going to the Lakes. We do get a milita parade, quite a bit of poultry, one Wuthering Heights like view of Lizzy standing in the wind atop a cliff which they would do well to edit out of the film, Darcy's proposal in a faux-temple during a rainstorm, and absolutely the best Assembly Ball ever filmed.  The director's commentary is quite interesting, too.<br /><br />Do you remember the Polanski film where our heroes are pretending to be the living dead, and at a zombie ball they dance down the room until suddenly they come upon a mirror and, being alive, they are reflected in it but none of the other dancers are?  Here when Mr. Darcy dances with Lizzy their conversation becomes so intense that the other dancers vanish for a couple of minutes and we just have our couple dancing alone in the ballroom. I don't know that the scenes connect in any other way but one scene calls forth the other to me.<br /><br />So aside from Wickham, what problems? Everyone compresses the sequence of events at the end, but here someone piled them up and stomped on them. Bingley returns to Netherfield, proposes in the afternoon, Lady Catherine arrives around midnight, and at the next dawn Lizzy and Darcy meet in a foggy field and become engaged. Poor Mr. Collins' letter never arrives, as you can imagine. Where could it have fit in? In about 16 hours of one day, we see what took weeks in the novel. Most bothersome is the visit to Pemberly. Lizzy becomes detached from the Gardiners, wanders off alone in the house, and hearing piano playing,  peeks through a door and sees Georgiana playing, then she sees Darcy enter and his sister and he embrace, till he looks up and sees Elizabeth peeping in at them. That's bad enough, (and quite out of character)  but then she walks back to Lambton without the Gardiners and without looking for them. Is it possible that they did not realize that she was no longer with them as they went through the house?  Still, one can excuse these little things. If we put up with Caroline Bingley's \\"fat suit\\" costume in the Garson version, we can put up with almost anything.<br /><br />My advice? Buy all 4 versions, book a transatlantic cruise, and give each version one full sea-day to watch and consider. I think you'll find yourself agreeing with me that the Keira Knightly film is the best, and you'll be happy you watched the others.th the other to me.<br /><br />So aside from Wickham, what problems?

0393317552|4.0|Just finished this book today... Of course this book is biased, he admits this in the \\"Afterword\\" section, in the first few paragraphs. Of course he has a few opinions about different groups of people being \\"smarter\\" than others (Eurasians) but he admits that it is his opinion. It's a great persective and I think it supplements nicely with other history books, filling up a few \\"holes\\" in history....which is riddled with biased holes like swiss cheese! It's interesting and I won't take his extensive work for granted. Also, his afterword gives a lot of insight of how free trade, free economies and de-centralized governments provide a better standard of living for everyone. Examples include the differences between South/North Korea, former East/West Germany, the D. Republic and Haiti...etc. Great points!  If anything, Diamond is biased in multiple accounts but the book is nothing short of amazing...

B000W1YYSQ|5.0|So let's say you have a friend who is only vaguely familiar with Rush, and you want to see if they have what it takes to become a full-fledged Rush fan.  They've heard a few tracks off Moving Pictures on the radio and didn't confuse them with Boston or Journey.  They might have seen the movie \\"I Love You Man\\" and wonder what all the fuss is about.  What I suggest is to lend them a copy of 2112 and see what they think.  Odds are they will either have one of two responses: (a) THAT WAS FREAKIN AWESOME!!!!! or (b) I'm just not into this band.<br /><br />It's alright if they are in the second category.  A lot of people are, even prominent music critics.  In fact, it was these critics who seemed to take the most pleasure in deriding this album when it was released in the 1970s.  This was the over-the-top space-themed concept album made by three guys in weird robes and sung by the one with the screechy voice that the proto-punk fanatics of the world loved to hate.  It was everything that garage rock wasn't. Where were the basic chords?  The songs about girls, cars, drugs and other familiar rock n roll subject matter?  Who, again, has assumed control, and of what?<br /><br />But then, if you could ask Jack Black's character in the movie School Of Rock what he thought about 2112 you'd probably get an hour long lecture on the power of this EPIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE CONTINUING SAGA OF FACE-MELTING ROCK N ROLL. There are plenty of others out there like him who have a strong visceral reaction to this music including one particular review-writing fool who starts giggling maniacally at the opening chords of 2112: Overture.  In fact, wasn't this album a pretty big seller in its day??!<br /><br />Before it became cool to like Rush (yes, that day seems to finally be here, although true Rush fans probably don't care if Rush is considered cool or not) there were quite a few of us who appreciated the band's unique blend of musical boundary-pushing, technical skill and heady pseudo-but-then-again-not-so-pseudo-philosophical lyrics.  Far from being a disaster, this album was seen as a triumph.  For us, the pomposity of the whole thing is what gives the music its charm.  This is basically what happens when three guys with intense technical skills and restless minds decide to do something that has never been done before and probably won't ever be done again.  Even the most skeptical of critics has to give them credit for that.<br /><br />But most of all, this album is just fun to listen to.  Over and over and over again.  At very loud volume.  Yeah it drags in places and no the lyrics don't really tell a consistent and linear story but that's not the point.  The point is that somehow it all gels, at least to these ears, into something great, huge, and magnificent that is all about paving your own path and following your imagination to its limits.  The Star Wars of rock n roll.<br /><br />But then, for the people who like club music or songs that tie up neatly in three minutes or so, this will always be a hard sell.  Perhaps that is why those of us who have been fans of this album for all the years that liking Rush was the equivalent in hipsterish circles of being a serial bed wetter hold it so dear.philosophical lyrics.

B00000I14Z|5.0|I was in college when I first experienced the raw power of Mingus Ah Um, starting with the one-two punch of \\"Better Get Hit In Your Soul\\" and \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.\\"  For a while it was all I would listen to in the car as I shuttled back and forth between home and school.  This disc is by turns blistering or slow n soulful, and in both cases it is the epitome of accessible jazz.  The artiness and abstract nature of the music doesn't overwhelm the deep bluesiness, allowing the primal and the intellectual sides to exist together in perfect balance.  Within the jazz realm there is nobody else quite like Charles Mingus, and his fiery and emotional personality comes through on each of these tracks.  This is one of the key jazz albums in my collection and the one that got me interested in the genre as a whole.  Far from the staid, neo-classical form of jazz that came to prominence in the 80s or the bland elevator-music-esque fusion that tends to get played on the radio, this is as real as it gets and worth every penny.

I loved watching the relationship between Emma and Dexter change and grow over the period of twenty years. I loved David Nicholls writing style, which was not at all predictable. I like how the end of the book brought the reader back to the beginning of Dexter and Emma's story, and gave you those unseen moments. The ending was perfect, again, not something that I had foreseen coming. Anyone who enjoys a good story about friendship, love, and life should pick this book up.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|Without a doubt, no one can say Lady Gaga is not innovative; her creativity bleeds from everything she does--head nod to those who say she is not entirely creative, yet she does give credit to those who have inspired her.<br /><br />This new album is definitely not as pop as it is pop-rock.<br /><br />Before BTW was released, there was massive tension about the out-of-the-blue and close release date of Femme Fatale. Little Monsters and Britney fans were all turning the cd releases into a competition. Needless to say, both cds take a completely different approach to pop music and comparisons between Lady Gaga and Britney should stop now. The only thing their music has in common is the fact that any one of their singles will remain on the charts for some time after being released.<br /><br />Placing BTW next to The Fame and The Fame Monster EP, it is hard to say whether I prefer BTW because it is newer or simply because it is truer. Breaking into the business, Gaga padded her original pop-rock sound--seen in her Red & Blue cd when she still went by Stefani Germanotta--by giving it a more pop sound, which did extremely well on the radio due to its purpose to appeal to the masses. Shifting from this and into the Fame Monster, Gaga showed more of her truer colors.<br /><br />Finally, we have BTW.<br /><br />Lady Gaga has grown a lot since her two releases and continues to write more interesting lyrics and melodies. Still true to pop, yet given more edge, Gaga's songs still have dance-ability, yet they are not as easy going down.<br /><br />Many people will be put off by church-related images and the \\"blasphemous\\" \\"Judas.\\" However, the difference between the reality of the images and the fantasy must be observed... They're metaphors people. Gaga even states in \\"You and I\\" that she will always serve Jesus Christ, verbatim.<br /><br />Ultimately, this new sound really works for me. Darker songs like \\"Bloody Mary\\" and passionate songs like \\"Americano\\" and \\"Highway Unicorn\\" really resonate with me, and seem to be the themes of Gaga's mission statement for the past year or so. Finally all of her promoting LGBT rights and personal freedoms takes form in her music! Clearly, Gaga walks the talk, proudly. I am happy with the extended version, but to be honest you do not need the three extra songs as Gaga's music is best represented in the original version.<br /><br />Can't wait to see where she takes us next! Hoping her next single is one of my three favorites!eally resonate with me, and seem to be the themes of Gaga's mission statement for the past year or so.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I loved this book.  I wasn't sure I would, since I'm not a mother, but it really did make you ask yourself some interesting questions.  There are some adjustments that are made throughout, changes that occur to the characters.  From these changes, I thought about the role women have as mothers, but also as children themselves.  The author's portrayal of Ma made me realize how much mothers sacrifice for their children.  Ma has to give up so much to make Jack's life better, and of course Jack, like so many of us, doesn't realize that.  It's an extreme case of sacrifice, but I think it's something we all should think about.

To learn later that Mr Kilmer actually sang most of the songs in the film himself, blew me away. I feel this film was before it's time. And Mr Kilmer should have been nominated for the performance. They nominated that actor for \\"Ray\\" and he did not even sing in the movie. I gave this movie 5 stars, for all the incredible acting done in this film especially Val Kilmer & Meg Ryan.

B000001FKY|5.0|Hysteria (1987) is one hell of an album with several hits, including POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME, ROCKET, and the title track, which sounds a lot like EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE, by the Police. It has the same beat and changes (for the most part). I like to think of it as a tad more upbeat version of that song. By no means do I think it was intentional on their part. Def Leppard would use the success of this album to become a mainstay in rock for decades to come. While some people didn't like the band transitioning into a more mainstream sound, it was almost inevitable after their drummer (Rick Allen) sustained a severed left arm in 1984. \\"Slowing it down\\" turned out to be a great move commercially, as they appealed to a wider audience. Get this album and appreciate the talents of the masters of pop metal.

Why would anyone want to insult the audience with this loathing, slumming movie?

B004UHF51S|5.0|Nothing goes down finer on a summer afternoon than a Michael Franks album and this one is already in his top five all time releases, right behind the Art of Tea...Now some of his more recent releases, stuff done with Jeff Lorber has not held up over time for me, but the various producers and vibes on these tracks are timeless...so some Timeless Time Together with Mr. Franks...Like a vacation but one you can take in your backyard, or car, or treadmill, or park, or beach, just a tremendous release...buy with confidence...
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Simply put.. both Em and Royce murk every single track on this album. Wish it was a bit longer, but WOW...best release this year hands down.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|on my Asus transformer. not sure what enhancements are in this version but it sure does play better than the original.
B004UHPU5E|3.0|Too smooth for me.  It was marketed as a ProjeKct, but fails to fit that description at all.  It is exquisitely well produced and sounds great in surround, but it just does not have what Crimson fans will be hoping for.
B004VD3PE0|4.0|If I Stay was a good, light read to me as an adult and yet there were certain moments in this girls life where she realizes things that she has never thought about before. Realizing these things brings up many questions that she has to go over and over in her mind until she comes to an answer to the question \\"What will happen if I stay or if I go?\\" I think both teens and adults will enjoy this book.

B004UHF51S|5.0|Well, Michael has done it again. The minute I downloaded the album I can see my ipod started smile. Don't take my word for it this CD is awesome. I seen and heard him in Dallas after spending the most romantic evening with my wife listening to his lyrical magic it was the most magical evening ever. Michael represent the S in Smooth Jazz. This CD will make your candle lights flicker and put the air in your bubbles as they escape the bath. Thanks Michael but you take too long to make an album. I hope you already started on the next. Great Piece of Work!!!!!!!!

0307588343|5.0|The story takes you through the inside world of a simple company gone wrong. He shows through his own eyes the world of the traders and what they saw day by day, as the situation got to points of insanity. Then along the way you get to see a more personal account of his story of getting to Lehman. I would recommend this book for people who read books about finance or anyone who wants to have a more clear picture into the world of traders. What sets it apart from other finance books is its readability. It can appeal to a much broader market because anyone will be able to pick it up and understand the story. Even the more complicated derivatives that Lehman was getting involved in are made easy to understand by the way that the story is written. Overall, I loved it and would highly recommend it.
B00000117E|5.0|Buy the silver covered version... the cover with Rory on the cover has a low  bass hum on the left speaker.. sounds like a mastering flaw. Buy from a company that offers money back.    Otherwise with regards to the music... This was Rorys best ... the best tone (as captured)He isn't screwing around with the vocals as he tended to do after this 2 year period ... his guitar playing is fiery and yet whimsical: truly his own sound and approach!!...  A true talent at the height of his career. Listen for Lou Martins overdub on his Tatoo'd Lady solo! He layed it right over the live one and I wouldn't have known if it wasn't for the DVD. The band is SO in sync which gives Rory his best backdrop ever to command from...  This is a must have.
0743455967|5.0|\\"On Writing\\" is an incredibly well written memoir by Stephen King.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game!  It's really fun and addicting.  Highly recommended!  It has, however, frozen my phone (Verizon Samsung Fascinate) a number of times - a few times during the game and a few times after I quit and the screen stays all white.

0810983915|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days is a good book, but that is just my opinion. You might think that the book is bad or good. Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days is about a boy named Gregory that just started middle school and is having a little trouble. So, he writes everything he has been through in a journal. I recommend this book to anyone age seven to fourteen.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I was a fan of Fleet Foxes first record. So I was waiting with excitement for the sophomore effort. And it was worth the wait. 'Helplessness Blues' is a confirmation that Fleet Foxes is a major act in american musical scene.
0670022411|5.0|It was nice to read a novel about the supernatural world that isn't overly sexed, and immature.  The author's depiction of the vampire-witch relationship is rich, and the historical detail adds a nice flair.  The characters are fleshed out, and the plot thickens, adding more layers and getting more riveting as you read.  Can't wait for the next installment!

159420229X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It seems others who didn't like this book just had the wrong impression of what they were buying so I thought I'd help out with that.  This book is a non-fiction personal account of the author's foray into the world of Memory athletes.  He does a great job of giving the history of what people have thought of memory in the past and how that differs with the present time.  It's also a good introduction to the topics you would need to look into if you want to improve your own memory skills.     As this is a personal account, I find the author's opinions about the people he met on his journey to be refreshingly candid.      I'm buying this book for family and friends who I think could benefit from it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|this book is wonderful. if you like greek myths and history with a twist you should read it! if you love rick riordans other series you should also read this. it is a MUST read!

1593272200|5.0|If your nose is a bit sensitive, the physical book might smell of chemicals, or at least the original copy that I received did.  I was able to get a less strongly smelling copy from the publisher, which helped a lot.  The hardcover edition is fat and pricey but worth it - looking at the sample code from the kindle version it came with it was kind of hard to keep track of what's going on while flipping through screens.    Also - I was confused on this point for a little bit - if you're looking for coverage of user space processes like systemd or command-line filters like less or grep, this is not the book for you - it covers only the underlying kernel system calls and c api which those filters are written with.    That said, I'm learning a lot about linux through this book - and C as well.  I learned C++ before I learned linux, in some programming class where we used it to build a simple calculator and similar tasks.  Learning C a bit later was a pain because it seemed so archaic and there was no proper motivation.  Reading this book, though, made me realize how C actually makes a lot of sense in its proper context as a tool primarily for systems programming, for which it was created.    It's still slow and dense to read and digest (I still have a long ways to go with it), but I don't think there's any way around that - there's a lot of subtle and good information here, and it builds up the foundations progressively.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|A musical comedy of mad science directed by Joss Whedon and starring Nathan Fillion, Felicia Day and Neil Patrick Harris?  Yes, please!    It's a short film, but one solidly written and acted.  As opposed to many of the over-the-top, convoluted and special-effects laden blockbusters, this is a much simpler concept expertly executed; as elegant a result as one could ask for.  Thankfully, the musical numbers were quite enjoyable, too.  (Nothing worse than a musical piece with bad music!)
B002ZG999U|5.0|The Expendables is an Awesome movie. An all star cast, very funny with all the one liners and full of action. Great Fathers Day gift! We Love it!
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I have set up six of these including one in my sister's house 2000miles away.<br /><br />They worked out of the box, setup is intuitive and easy.  The provide fast reliable connections for a wide variety of devices from windows, mac and linux laptops and pcs to Android, iPhones and iPads, to printers, Tivo and wireless IP cameras.<br /><br />Reading the negative reviews I'm not looking forward to the day I have to call customer support but that has yet to be high on my list for any product.  So far I have not had to power cycle them except for one laptop that has other problems as well.  It's been over a year since the first one went in.<br /><br />My firmware was up to date when they arrived so I haven't tried that and in general I don't update firmware unless it contains a fix or a feature I need because of the risks.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|I got this for my grandson for his birthday - he was born on Halloween! It is so lifelike, he  was scared to touch it for an hour after he opened it. Now, it is his favorite toy!! He had spiders all over his room  - stuffed, wire, rubber - but this one was so real he almost panicked. I don't recommend it for most kids until they are prepared for it. Thank God he's a brave one, otherwise he might have been traumatized. He knew I had gotten it for him but he was still surprised. He was five and I wasn't expecting his reaction considering he has a live snake and a tortoise as big as a plate in his room. You jus never know, sometimes. He has a Rottweiler, but he was scared of my milk goat. So just make sure they can handle this little dose of reality.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Of all the comic book adaptations made, Thor was easily my most awaited. Thor is my favorite comic book character, so I couldn't wait to see him on the big screen. There were some worries though. Most modern adaptations of Thor weren't treated with much respect or dignity. I'm happy to say all my worries were quickly erased.    Like others have said, Thor is easily one of the toughest heroes to adapt onscreen. Thor is a hero who navigates between two connected, but different worlds. I thought the writers did a brilliant job all-around though. Thor has often been shown as a fish-out-of-water on earth, but I thought he adapted and fit-in well on earth here.     This isn't a true origins films as most comic book films usually are. Thors' early life is mostly grossed over, which is probably good. Probably take too much time to tell anyway. The early, but short battle between Asgard and the Frost Giants had me mesmerized from the beginnng.  And as a unapologetic fan of action films and/or sequences, I've got to say by action expectations were easily filled. Thor managed to get about 5-6 action sequences into a fairly complex storyline.    The story was quite complex but very good overall. Great casting choices all-around. Great villian in Loki. Much better than I expected actually. Always thought he was one-note in the comics, but the actor really fleshed him out. Our hero Thor was played beautifully I thought. Made me proud to be a Thor fan. Odin was just as regal and imposing as I've always envisioned him. Much respect to Sir Anthony Hopkins! Now I can sometimes do without the love interest aspects of these films, but I gotta say Natalie Portman as Jane, was very much appreciated and welcomed by me. She did a great job, plus I think she's kind of hot. Loved the Warriors Three, and especially loved the awesome and baeutiful warrior Lady Sif. Hope to see more of Sif in the sequels. Also enjoyed Thors' other earthly friendly, especially the one with Norway roots.       Nocomplaints here at all. Well other than it being in 3D. Just felt the 3D wasn't needed, plus I never liked it. Others seem to like the 3D just fine though. I was thoroughly entertained by this film, and would have probably seen it 5 times if it wasn't in 3D. Can't wait until this gets released on blu-ray and dvd, and especially can't wait until the sequel comes out.
B0040PYVTW|5.0|This album really exemplify what good music should sound like. There is a lot of garbage to wade through these days, but when you come across a great album like \\"Good Things\\", it is worth the time and effort you put into searching for good music. I really appreciate the down south style soul that Aloe Blacc puts into the music. His old school mojo really bring the songs alive with a new school twist.
0061684384|5.0|This is a fantastic book I recieved and read twice in one week the illustrations are excellent and the hard bound cover is padded. It's a book I will read over and over, Kat goes through her life very candidly & shows her own personal journey to where she is now.  I would highly recomend this read!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|This is a great series and I'm glad to be able to add this to the rest of my Seasons collection.  Great acting, story lines, and surprises.  EXCELLENT!!!
B000Y7U98W|5.0|I didn't see this 2007 movie until June 2011... I've seen it five times in two weeks now. I don't really care about the science because it's science fiction. It's not 2001, 2010, Alien, Star Trek, Event Horizon, Star Wars or any other space movie... it's Sunshine. It's not a slasher film as some have claimed either. The film is supurbly cast and acted to the last detail. The filming and effects are some of the best I've ever seen - particularly the shots of the sun and the shield. It did take a few viewings to figure out what was happening from beginning to end but I get it now. Glad I just happened to catch it. I don't own three blu-rays but this one is coming to me.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is probably my favorite Josh Groban album, and I like them all.   The songs are fresh, and personal, and the over-all selection is moving and well-balanced.   I am truly impressed!
B001POX73C|3.0|Freebie book, interesting verbage, a bit too wordy at times. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it by the time I got to the end. Not a fan of Regency romances, but this was quirky and fun.
B00544L9EI|5.0|This album is the best rap-duo album ever made, with the 2 best MCs in the game right now. Eminem comes harder than ever in this album and Royce is pretty much equal to Em on this CD (Royce is the only rapper on the same level as Eminem in my opinion). Eminem is at the top of his game lyrically and flow-wise, so I hope he comes out with a couple more albums where he comes as hard as he did on this CD. In my opinion this is up there with Eminem's best work, and is going to be a classic rap CD considering Em and Royce's skills.    Standout tracks: Everything but 'Lighters', I wouldn't have a problem with this song, it just doesn't belong on this album.    10/10
B00005JKTF|1.0|I am a late comer in viewing this film, even later in reading a synopsis of the heroine's life in the Telegraph news publication, which told of a much more interesting woman.  The Telegraph article, Lonely death of real life Charlotte Gray, reported that Ms. Gray was flown to France to work as a wireless operator. \\"Four months later she was caught using her radio set but, even after torture, persuaded the Gestapo that she was merely a little shopgirl who knew nothing of undercover war operations. But on Aug 15, 1944, she was sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany. She was later transferred to a forced labour camp in Silesia, on the German border.   On April 13, 1945, she escaped with two French girls from the forced labour gang by hiding in the forest. They later travelled through Markkleeberg where they were arrested by the SS. Eileen Nearne's ingenuity again proved to be life-saving, because they were released after convincing their captors of their innocence. The three women were hidden by a priest in Leipzig until the arrival of United States troops. I realized that the movie was a poor representation of this woman's life.\\"  This would have made for a more heroic story.    Gray spoke of being a hero and of making a difference but when the time arrived to do so, she failed miserably. I was gravely disappointed that Gray, the protagonist in this film, did not attempt to fulfill her commitment she made to the boys as they were being taken away by the Nazis.  \\"I will find you,\\" she scream.  Whenever a protagonist makes this claim, h/she always deliver but not this one.  Not only did she not seek them out, she never even spoke of the boys again.  Even when the resistance leader begged her to flee with him, she rejected and declared that she could and would do more.  So logical person would interpret this to mean that she would attempt to free the boys, NOT! She was more talk than action.  The ending would have been perfect had she, the resistance leader (her new love) and the 2 boys shared the last scene as a family.    If you're going to change the events of a true story, you should at a minimum make it more interesting and satisfying.  This film did not.  I can not forget those 2 boys as they gently touch the letter they thought was written by their mother.
B004EPYZOY|5.0|No spoilers here. Just wanna say that this movie is exactly as advertised. The women are hot, the action is intense, and the bluray is awesome. Both the video quality and audio are amazing. You can't pass up the price either. Get it while you can......
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|This is the revenge of the entire feminine universe against the masculine predominance of the modern society based exclusively on conjecture and traditions.<br /><br />In my opinion the metaphor of this title message is a conceptualisation of the feminine universe as the \\"Nest\\" which is invaded and oppressed by the \\"Hornets\\"(the masculine universe)<br /><br />After three pages of this novel, there is a page dedicated to \\"Boudicca\\" the queen of the Iceni.<br /><br />Clearly the intentions of the author was not only underline this historical fact, but to say that even in the past the women were considered as an active part of the society and their suffering for obtaining a relevant social position.<br /><br />From page 161 to 445 I think that, there is only a chronology of facts and opinions which are pretty boring, but not the comparison between Dr. Teleborian and Salander; the strongest character is the doctor, but after four pages, the author introduces the \\"rich variety of Amazon legends\\" i.e. the documentation of the existence of female warriors completely forgotten by the history books, in order to demonstrate his contrariness.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Italo

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I've been using this for a couple months now and love it! Easy interface and great customization options. The slow building volume on the alarm is a pleasant way to rouse me out of my sleep. And for those mornings that I just don't want to get up, the math problem snooze/dismiss option definitely works. App used on a galaxy S samsung fascinate.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I figured for less than 6 bucks it would be worth the gamble for this. What I got was basically a copy of the movie. No extras, just the movie. The disc didn't even have anything  printed on it.   The jewel case at least had the insert with the title and artwork. The good thing is, the DVD played OK and it was cheap. I'm giving it 4 stars because of those two factors plus this movie is a favorite of mine and the usual excellent service I've come to expect from Amazon.
6303187064|5.0|Remembered mostly for Brandon Lee's untimely & accidental death while filming, The Crow is a visually compelling movie. Brandon Lee did an excellent job, exuding angst, pain and revenge in this chilling tale. It's amazing to see how the remaining scenes were completed, and most of the film had already been shot when Mr. Lee was accidentally killed. Great movie. Could have bwwn longer, though, with additional scenes showing how Eric and Shelley came to care for Sarah and how Shelley & Eric met. This movie also reminds us that \\"Buildings burn and people die, but real love is forever.\\" Should have been rated PG-13.
0671449028|4.0|I read this book each night to my child and have found it very helpful as a before bedtime ritual to help my child fall asleep faster at night. Sometimes she gets a little tired now and asks me to read her book before bed.
B004RYVE3W|4.0|This is a great annotated edition. Very few redundent notations. The only reason it did not get five stars is because in two spots the annotator comments on Mary Crawford speaking unusual views for women at the time. Which would be fine except in one instance it isn't her speaking and in another instance she's not even in the room and really it is Edmund speaking. Other than that it was very interesting. Especially for the price which is very reasonable compared to the ten dollar and up annotated editions. Another thing that I liked about it was that next to the annotation links he had letters indicating if it was an opinion, word, or historical note which made it much nicer to be able to skip words that I already know the meaning of.
0307477479|5.0|Not everyone who loves this book is part of the literary in-crowd or desperate to appear so. Who knows how many reviewers (professional and non-) for any particular book are \\"parrots\\", but it is facile and insulting to assert that we all are. I'm not important, I don't know anyone, and I don't spend time writing customer reviews, probably because I don't have anything particularly insightful to say. But I read a good number of books, and I loved this one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a great voice and her songs are contemporary.  I predict she will be a top artist very quickly.  The CD was nicely packaged and arrived in mint condition.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I discovered the series after watching the movie (\\"Serenity\\").  What a great cast!  I like every one of them.  Creative story lines too!  Makes me wish once again that Hollywood would slow down a little to give new series the chance to catch on.  This one would have run for quite a long while!
B004CIIXC8|5.0|\\"Fish Tank\\" (2009) is an odd blend of \\"Wasp\\" (Andrea Arnold's 2003 short film) and \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\".  The closing scene where Mia (Katie Jarvis) is saying goodbye to her little sister was especially evocative of the last words in Betty Smith's \\"A Tree Grows In Brooklyn\\"; when Francie is about to leave and takes one last look over at the fire escape where 10-year-old Florry Wendy is reading a book, then whispers \\"Good-bye, Francie\\".<br /><br />The film is not for everyone but if you like naturalistic acting and a gritty (often dreary) story you would be well served to track down this film.  It is a film of in-your-face close-ups and the 4:3 aspect ratio was a perfect choice for this style.  A wider frame would have diminished the intensity while adding nothing.<br /><br />What Arnold does better than any director I can think of is her acting-for-the-camera direction of young actresses.  This was certainly true with the three children in \\"Wasp\\", who seemed to effortlessly give Arnold just the underplayed performances she needed.  In \\"Fish Tank\\" she gently guides Jarvis toward a performance full of gritty authenticity.  And she scores again with Rebecca Griffith's tragicomic portrayal of little sister Tyler (with lines as funny as they are poignant).<br /><br />Griffith's character is especially important because at its core this is a  story of free will vs destiny.  And Mia must recognize her destiny if she is to change it.  This recognition comes with the death of the Irish Traveler horse (symbolized by the chain and concrete block that once constrained it) and with the realization that she and her \\"chip-off-the-same-block\\" younger sister are the same person at different stages; traveling the same road to an inevitable nothing.  This motivates her to break out of the rut into which she was born, a track where one is distracted by superficial false hopes from seeking real opportunity. Her new road may end badly but she has nothing to lose.<br /><br />Anothernicely directed naturalistic performance is turned in by Sydney Mary Nash as Keira.  Her scenes are probably the best in the film, they certainly were the most difficult.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
0312263511|3.0|There really isn't that much profanity, but the amount there, especially the big words, surprised me, given the context.  Before writing me off as a goodie, let me explain.  I found out about this book at Johnson Space Center during a week promoted for schools to visit.  Eugene Cernan himself was speaking to a group of elementary school children about his adventures, and of course we were made aware of the book.  I never heard of Eugene Cernan, but I appreciated the time he took to visit with my children and their friends, so I bought an autographed copy.  I quickly noticed the ego, though he seems to know that himself, and figured maybe that's what it takes to risk your life in space or military aircraft.  Soon enough I ran into a few words here and there, which seemed to increase as the book went on.  I can understand a quote here and there about what happened in real life, but he seemed to enjoy his language.  I can even understand that, but what bothered me is that I was introduced to him as a retired space hero, talking to my children, and regularly in the book he refers to his religious beliefs, and even calls himself an apostle of some sort, to guide the youth to the heavens (space).  Sometimes he came across as inspirational, solemn, and pious, and other times as a crude man.  After explaining the amount of trouble he got into for swearing in space, his language in the book seemed to intensify, as if to say \\"Take that!\\", even after all these years.  This could have been a better book, and Eugene Cernan a better role model, with less basic language.    I did enjoy the read.  To be fair to the title, it is about the last man on the moon, not just the last lunar mission, so we read about growing up and moving through the ranks to get to where he is.  I have a better understanding of what it took to get there, and a better appreciation for the scientists, engineers, and astronauts for the amazing accomplishments.  I suspect that this is a reasonably accurate overview of the struggles, politics, egos, and danger of space travel.  And I still appreciate that Mr. Cernan took the time to speak to a bunch of school children.

0441013597|2.0|I really wanted to like Dune. I really did. But I just couldn't. There's enough here that I didn't like that I just can't put aside; and I stress that these are just my opinions and interpretations of the book, and therefore possibly be irrelevant to people who have different preferences. Skip to the end for a short version of my perceptions of this book.    To start with the good - the world of Dune here is excellent. The world is generally consistent, with a good deal of thought put into the various aspects of culture and their interactions with the physical world they're placed in. For the better part, Herbert lets this come out naturally; it's mostly incidental instead of gigantic slabs of information.    But, for me at least, this wasn't enough. The characters didn't interest me. Oh, there were a few secondary characters who piqued my interest, but other than that there's nobody I really wanted to read more about. Maybe this has something to do with how all the characters subscribe to the same basic Machiavellian political theory, which more or less deflates their conflicts. Maybe it's the way that Herbert both shows and tells far more than he should, getting inside multiple characters perspectives during a single scene, which removes any suspense or speculation; that typically only works when the characters are on the same side. I don't know. I just didn't care for them.    Another problem here are my perceived inconsistencies. For example, the main commodity in this story is shopped around the various Houses, basically like a contract. I can't figure out why the other main players, eg emperor and Bene Gesserit, aren't making more serious attempts to control this commodity; it's outright stated that it's a staple good that is hugely valuable. Especially given the capacity that these main players have to act in their interests so freely.    The technology also confused me; I got the stuff about artificial intelligence being bad, but come on, there's a possibility for such a wide expanse of technology without it being AI. Maybe it's because the story was written in the 1960's, so maybe this criticism is a bit unfair. But then they're trained in hand-to-hand combat, even though they have shields that can protect them from those weapons completely. There's a disconnect there between that and the politics that the characters get themselves involved in, I just can't resolve it in my head.    A central character, who's supposed to have undergone some of the most thorough psychological training to prepare him for his job and to resist being broken. How is he broken? His wife is kidnapped. While it's a touching moment in a book that doesn't have many, it doesn't make sense. That would, logically, be one of the first things you'd be prepared against. Other characters are supposed to be incredibly intelligent and excellent at critical thought, but then fail to display that. So on and so forth. It killed my suspension of disbelief.    Herbert's writing style also grates with me. It's not all bad, but it just seems as though he didn't quite know how to get things from his head onto the page; the result is, in my opinion, an awkward, cluttered prose. The pacing is poor. Too much telling, especially in establishing character relationships. Then there are sections where a bit of exposition IS required and instead there's only showing (a good example is when the ecologist is talking about \\"tipping\\" the ecosystem - i'm no stranger to climate science, but I had to read this half a dozen times before it started making sense).    There are other things i've probably forgotten, but these are my main gripes. Again, I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't. I have to have a reason to immerse myself in the world so deeply as to gain the same knowledge as hardcore fans; I couldn't find that reason in this book.    So long story short: wonderful world, decent plot, characters felt flat, uninspiring and too similar to me, a number of poor writing choices that left me disoriented, and too many logical inconsistencies within the story. The logical inconsistencies annoy me, but the ultimate let down is characters. I left this book completely indifferent to the characters.    2/5
0802473156|5.0|This book is amazing. Dr. Chapman expresses things about me that I didn't even know about me. Such as, what I really want from my mate and how to love him the way he wants to be loved. Hands down, between this book and GOD, this is all the therapy you'll need.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|I am not an Alanis Morssette fan and enjoy just barely a few if any of her earlier songs.  But I have got to say that this album is quite remarkable.  I would rank it with the top accomplishments in music period.  She is her own genre and has graduated to a place that is impressive.  Very strong line up of songs that are unique and captivating.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|This is very well done. Great photos and info about the making of the album. Already ordered McCartney II. Now, if they could only do the same for Let it Be. A nice hardcover book with all of the photos, and the DVD in the back pocket. Come on Apple!

0061251305|5.0|I really think a book like this deserves a moment of silence. It marks a leadership turning point by its own topic plus instructs those who wish to practice the necessary behaviors that will hone the wisdom of the lessons.<br /><br />Honestly, this book should be singled out away from the carnival midway of the madding crowd of business and self-help clamor. OK, you guessed it. I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Tribal Leadership is the work of smart people. Dave Logan's voice shines through. He is brilliant, down to earth, and sensitive to his audience. He keeps to his own injunction--\\"don't be weird,\\" even when he could get away with it, and he could. If ever there was a thinker who could easily wear the robes of iconoclast, eccentric, loveably strange, Dave has earned the right, but instead, he presents himself as  'normal'. I guess it's because he gets it, the true measure of well rounded intelligence.<br /><br />John King and Halee Fischer Wright continue the triad of authors to give Tribal Leadership a strong foundation, adding great insight, key points, and illustrative examples. I am always impressed with John's ability to communicate complex ideas, simply. As for Halee Fischer Wright, I know little about her but can assume volumes by the company she keeps.<br /><br />Review<br /><br />Quick lessons from TL-<br /><br />Once a developmental stage is identified there are specific ways to interact with that level to guide a predictable result.<br /><br />Developmental stages are infectious. The negative opportunistic lethargy that often hovers around Stage 2 can spread like wildfire if left unchecked. It takes mindful leadership to perceive the various levels and work with them to move toward a goal.<br /><br />A Stage 4 body of people (Jack Stack, Zappos,) working with mutuality can operate as a cult-like machine to accomplish more than stages 1, 2 or 3, whether in business or other focused challenges.<br /><br />Stage Three is familiar to us from typical achieverbusinesses. Most of us are quite familiar with bosses and politicians who think, \\"I'm great, (implying \\"and you're not\\".)  Learning to navigate these people takes understanding and this book provides it.<br /><br />While I don't expect a sudden movement to be born from the book's thinking, I do applaud the groundwork that has been laid.<br /><br />Drawing from years of behind the scenes work and painstaking details, the three authors have distilled a volume that, I predict, will become a standard. This book makes a difference. It is a turning point in both business and personal wisdom. I suggest you read, study, and apply the insights of Tribal Leadership.

B004WJREMW|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite McCartney albums, and it has never sounded better! Along with GREAT sound quality comes the excellence in its packaging. The CDs are well protected in heavy cardboard sleeves, resisting scratches. The last thing that impressed me about this remaster was its cover art - very bright and vivid details. Nice!

The screen protector comes with the polishing cloth and the mini plastic card to smooth out the air bubbles. I do like the smokey/opaque color. I could be wrong, but I think most people are going to want a much more zippy/stylish case.

B004WJREMW|4.0|*Note that this is the last half of my review on the McCartney and McCartney II reissues. If you haven't already, look on the [[ASIN:B004WJRF6C McCartney]] page.    After the listener listens to this album, they might make the confused face that Paul has on the album's cover. It's easy to understand: this album is very experimental, but so was McCartney in some way. McCartney II is actually a really good album. I like the sound of it personally. It's different and kind of trippy and funky. This album was recorded in July 1979, shortly after Wings had released their seventh (and later, final) album Back To The Egg. Paul recorded this album in Scotland and like McCartney, he played all the instruments, but this time with the aid of a sixteen track machine. Paul also had a new toy: a synthesizer. This is one of the reasons why some critics and fans don't care for McCartney II. I'm not a big fan of the synth either but Paul makes this easy to listen to. The album opens with \\"Coming Up\\", an instant classic. The live version taken from the 1979 gig in Glasgow made \\"Coming Up\\" a #1 hit single. If you're reading this, please go check out the promo/music video to \\"Coming Up\\". It's just wacky. Some people may skip over songs like \\"Temporary Secretary\\", \\"Front Parlour\\", \\"Frozen Jap\\", and many others due to the fact that there all use one too many synthesizers. I actually like \\"Temporary Secretary\\" and I also really dig \\"Frozen Jap\\", which is also an awesome song title! I like the entire first side of the album. Along with \\"Coming Up\\" and \\"Temporary Secretary\\", there's the slow rocker \\"On The Way\\", the simply beautiful \\"Waterfalls\\", and the upbeat \\"Nobody Knows\\". The second side isn't as good. My least favorite song is probably \\"Bogey Music\\". It's got this 1950's feel but it's kind of annoying.  \\"Frozen Jap\\" is much like \\"Front Parlour\\" but there's something I like about it. I think it's the Japanese-like sound it has! I also like the reggae-flavored \\"Darkroom\\".     The seconddisc for McCartney II has eight songs and a run time of 48 minutes. Some of these songs are edits of long songs (the full length versions can be found on the third disc on the deluxe edition of this album. Both McCartney and McCartney II have deluxe editions w/ photo books and a DVD) The hit live version of \\"Coming Up\\" is on here as is \\"Wonderful Christmastime\\", which was another hit for Paul. \\"Check My Machine\\" is a very funky track that I'm really liking. It was a B-side to \\"Waterfalls\\". There's also the ten minute \\"Secret Friend\\", which was a B-side for \\"Temporary Secretary\\". For all of you real die-hard fans, there's three previously unreleased tracks that didn't make the final album (which are on a bootleg called The Lost McCartney II Album). Those three are \\"Mr H Atom/You Know I'll Get You Baby\\", \\"Bogey Wobble\\", and \\"All You Horse Riders/Blue Sway\\".    I was undecided at first as to buying these two reissues. I have to say that I'm pretty happy with my purchase. These are two really good albums and they sound clean. You also got the bonus discs, which have some lost treasures that are worth listening to. If you're a die-hard fan of the Beatles and/or Paul McCartney, you may want to pick these up.

B004WJRF6C|4.0|*Note that this is the first half of my review on the McCartney and McCartney II reissues. For my review on [[ASIN:B004WJREMW McCartney II]], click on it there!<br /><br />The Paul McCartney Archive Collection has released two more reissues to follow up last year's reissue of Band on the Run. For this release, MPL and Concord decided to release Macca's two self-titled solo albums. One would wonder what's so special about these albums. Both albums literally put the \\"solo\\" in \\"solo album\\": Paul McCartney is the only person playing any instrument on these two albums, with Linda providing backing vocals and harmonies. The albums have been remastered and I must say that they sound like Paul's grandfather! Let's review them, shall we?<br /><br />Paul's first album, simply titled McCartney, was released on April 17, 1970. Just a week before the release, Paul had announced he was leaving the Beatles which broke up the band as a result. This means that Paul was making this album secretly while he was still in the Beatles. Recording began in late 1969, which by that time, the Beatles were struggling financially (with Apple) and personally. Many of the songs on McCartney began life as Beatles songs during the infamous Get Back/Let It Be recording session in early 1969. These songs would include the beautifully dark \\"Junk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\" which tells the tale of a young boy who lives with his mother, but is interrupted by her new husband. There's also short ditties like \\"The Lovely Linda\\" and instrumental songs such as \\"Hot As Sun/Glasses\\" (another Beatles left over) and the somewhat heavy \\"Kreen-Akrore\\". Paul does rock out, but just for a bit, with \\"Oo You\\". For some reason, I've always liked that song. It's got nice guitar playing on it! There are plenty of ballads and/or slower songs like the gentle \\"Every Night\\" and many others. The most popular song of this album is, without a doubt, \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". It's such a nice ballad and apparently, Paul wrote it about how Linda was caring for him during the long and painful split with the Beatles.<br /><br />There isn't a lot on the second disc. There are only seven tracks and the entire second disc is just 25 minutes. McCartney is 34 minutes long. Um, all of this could've fit perfectly onto one disc...or not (depending on how much room the remastered tracks are taking up on the disc, I don't know. Just a thought). Firstly, there's a nice outtake called \\"Suicide\\". Paul was originally going to put it on the final album but it was left unreleased. The excellent performance of \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" from the One Hand Clapping documentary is also on here. One would wonder why it wasn't put on the second disc for Band On The Run but I think it was saved for McCartney, given that \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is from McCartney. Next, there are three live cuts from a Wings show in Glasgow in 1979. The songs are \\"Every Night\\", \\"Hot As Sun\\", and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". All three sound great and I think it's nice to have some kind of live recording of that line-up of Wings (w/ Laurence Juber and Steve Holly). \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" is basically \\"Oo You\\" as an instrumental. I think it was called \\"Don't Cry Baby\\" since in the beginning, you can hear Paul say it and also the cries of a baby (possibly Paul's daughter Mary?). The last track is a demo called \\"Women Kind\\" and it's a bit silly! Paul's voices are too much!<br /><br />Review continues on the [[ASIN:B004WJREMW McCartney II]] page.im during the long and painful split with the Beatles.     There isn't a lot on the second disc.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I have a couple of great amps - 75watt Peavy Vyper and a Blackstar HT-5R 5 watt tube amp.  I also use some pedals - Boss MT-2 metal zone, and a metal muff with top boost.  It's not practicle for me to use those amps all the time so when I need to be quiet I plug this thing in and get a fantastic metal tone, can dial down to little gain or spin it up to high gain.  Also has a volume and tone knob.  You're not going to get Dimebag or Wylde squeals out of it but you can get a decent Metallica rhythm tone from it.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|While they look like Tokio Hotel, the sound of Black Veil Brides is the vocal style of Metallica meets the musicianship of Avenged Sevenfold.  The actual songwriting falls somewhere in between the two.  The result is something new and exciting, but sounding familiar.  I bought this just on the sneak previews for Fallen Angels, and was suprised how deep this album is.  It's hard to imgagine, while looking at the video, that this young band can sound so refined and mature, but just listening to the music itself, it seemed that James Hetfield had joined up with a younger, hipper band.  And I love the result.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|OK I am posting this review as I feel some may miss out on an amazing story because they start watching with the wrong idea. My entire household has seen Band of Brothers multiple times and we LOVE the film. That being said, if you start watching The Pacific hoping for the same dynamic as Band of Brothers, you will be disappointed. We originally started watching it with that in our minds, and as a result, this film seemed to fall short...to the point we didn't even bother to finish it (I am ashamed to say)<br /><br />So months later, we decided to give it another go only this time knowing it was VERY different from Band of Brothers and knowing these films are shot in two very different ways, in two very different tones. Now watching it for the second time, keeping in mind that it is its own film, I can honestly say it is not better nor is it worse then Band of Brothers. It stands on its own (and wonderfully so) as a monument to all who served in the Pacific. Honestly, I really love this movie just as much as Band of Brothers and feel awful I didn't give it a chance the first time around.<br /><br />While Brotherhood is still a theme in this film, what shines through is the REAL emotional aspect of war. The journey from who you are to what war does to each individual and how it affects those it touches. While that was a theme in Band of Brothers, brotherhood was the more centralized theme. I think what I liked best about this series was seeing the inner conflict and how war changes a man. I appreciate that they even delved into the Post Traumatic Stress many suffered after coming home, something which Band of Brothers never really approached. It is the sheer honesty of how the mental anguish was approached that I think really made this shine. Those of you that are fans of Band of Brothers, give this movie a chance as I think you will be delightfully surprised, just don't go into watching it thinking this will be anything like Band of Brothers because everything about it is different from the way it's shot to the journey you take while watching it. It will take longer to attach to some of the people, will be a little harder to follow at the start, but by the end it truly left me in awe and even sparked a conversation with my 13 yr old son about how much has been sacrificed for the sake of all of our safety.

B0043RSJ8G|5.0|This book is very well written. Ms. Picoult branches out on an almost forbidden subject of gay/lesbian. She shows that love does not have to be man/woman. It can be with whomever you want to be with. The books holds your interest totally and I was very surprised that I read it in one day. I highly recommend this book!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I don't do reviews that go episode by episode as I feel there are others that do that so much better then me so I'm instead going to discuss what this series \\"adds\\" to the classic horror genre.     If you go into this wanting \\"horror\\" made for TV, you will be disappointed as this is not necessarily a \\"scary\\" TV show for someone who has seen movies like 28 Days Later, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead etc. (It would be scary for those who possibly don't watch this genre normally or younger children though) This series is honestly a far cry from those types of movies and to me is closer to something like Stephen King's The Stand in feel. The filming is done with the people at the center of the series rather then the zombies and follows them as they decide how to live in and cope with a world where the dead walk. If you are someone who is into films or television with an Apocalyptic type theme, you should really enjoy this series as it does get you thinking of how you would respond and what you would do in these circumstances. The filming is generally gritty and was very well done and does put you into the middle of what the people are going through and that combined with a wonderful cast that really draws you in is what makes this really special. All in all, a great compliment to the genre, intelligent, thought provoking and well written. Can't wait for Season 2! :O)

B004RC8NUQ|3.0|I like both Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher but they have very different strengths - his is comedy and hers is drama - and that really showed in this movie. They never seemed quite in synch or both comfortable at once. Kutcher was better in the first half, when they were in their 'no strings attached' sex phase, and the movie was standard semi-raunchy rom-com fare. Portman was better in the second half, when they broke up, and had to do some soul-searching to decide what they wanted from each other. The writing was just so-so, as were the requisite surrounding comedy-relief 'friends.' So overall, an OK watch, but not great.

I have a hard tome getting passed on how good Z is, and how are the others will compare, since most of the books out there are only getting 3 stars at best, not many of them are getting 4 or more. I have noticed that some are turning into 3 part books, and I don't like wasting time/money on a series, when the 1st book isn't very good. I do hope to see a more different concept out there on how it starts, and I do realize that zombies has been over done beyond belief, but the better books are out there, its just that they are VERY HARD TO FIND. But please read this book, and you'll understand why this is the \\"bible\\" of zombie books.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|Every now and then a movie comes along that seems like the writer had just sat through several old movies and tried to blend them together.  The Box is a great example of a lousy job of that.  The advertised premise caught my interest... regular people given the option to gain $1M in exchange for the death of someone they do not know.  But, I get the funniest feeling of ... deja vu...  Past movies of a similar money-for-death choice:  \\"The Lesser Evil\\" (1997) and \\"A Simple Plan\\" (1998)  Past movies that start with seemingly true-life, then switch to sci-fi aliens: \\"The Forgotten\\" (2004), \\"The Thing\\" (1982), \\"Independence Day\\" (1996)    These were all gripping, well-done movies (except maybe the most similar, which was The Forgotten).    Past sci-fi movie that makes less sense the longer it plays: \\"Phantasm\\" (1979)  This freaked-out movie had that SAME put-your-fingers-through-to-another-dimension thing.  Too weird and too hodgepodge for me.    \\"The Box\\" could have and should have stayed within true-life.  Real life tension stays way higher than opening the anything-goes floodgates of aliens-among-us.  Keep the creepiness of Langella (how can you not?), but had the story stayed \\"real,\\" it would have been a Box-buster movie!
B004O0TKWG|5.0|Two of Gerry Rafferty's seminal solo albums arrive in a two CD set without any notes or credits but both sound sweet. \\"City to City\\" announced the arrival of Gerry Rafferty as a solo artist with powerful songs, insightful lyrics and melodies as rich as those he composed while a member as Stealer's Wheel. Although \\"City to City\\" was Gerry's second solo album (\\"Can I Have My Money Back\\" from 1971 was the first), the album presented a mature, powerful talent with a healthy dose of cynicism in his lyrics.<br /><br />The CDs look and sound the same as the original 1989 CD issues and it was probably repackaged to tie in to Gerry's death early this year (2011). Unfortunately, EMI DID drop the ball when it comes to adding any insightful liner notes or even album credits; the \\"booklet\\" consists of the covers for both albums on the front and on the inside with the full size CD booklet covers but nothing else.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is really about the music and these terrific classic albums sound great here. The U.S. version of \\"City to City\\" was sped up about 4% so if you buy this be aware that the tracks are a little bit looser sounding and a little bit slower in tempo. The U.S. version is also available (it has been issued on CD as well in the U.S. exclusively)for \\"City to City\\" so if you're preferred version is the sped up version you heard on radio back in the day, you may want to spring for that one.<br /><br />\\"City to City\\" has a nice, crisp sound and a nice dynamic range replicating that from the original release on vinyl. The sound is terrific for \\"Night Owl\\" again with a nice wide dynamic range (unusual for a recently issued CD and that's because it's a straight reissue of the previous version and a flat transfer as near as I can tell without any fiddling with the music). \\"Night Owl\\" is the more intimate companion album to \\"City to City\\" but both are atmospheric sounding and compliment each other well. Although \\"Night Owl\\" didn't sell quite as well as \\"City to City\\" the fact that it remains undiscovered for many people only adds to its allure.<br /><br />It's a pity that EMI didn't choose to do more with both of these albums such as look in their archives for outtakes, bonus tracks and/or include the U.S. single version of \\"Baker Street\\" since with the song slightly sped up it has a slightly different flavor.<br /><br />Even though this reissue could have been done a bit better it's the music that matters and it sounds terrific.<br /><br />Highly recommended.it remains undiscovered for many people only adds to its allure.

B004LAIU4I|3.0|As a fan of Paul Simon since his earliest Simon & Garfunkel days, I have to say I am disappointed with this album. It got so much reviewer hype that I thought it must be great, and the last album of his that I have, \\"You're the One,\\" was superb, in my opinion. This one, on first listen, left me wishing I could get my money back! On second listen it was somewhat better, so perhaps, as one reviewer here says, it will grow on me as I listen to it more. However, it mostly proves to me that professional music reviewers are really doing nothing but offering their own opinions and musical tastes, which have nothing to do with mine. There is no great social commentary here, as one might expect of Paul Simon--certainly nothing on the level of \\"Pigs, Sheep and Wolves\\" (from \\"You're the One\\"). I say, if you've got Paul Simon's old stuff, you've got the best. Stick with that!

B004KA9MQO|1.0|Jennifer Hudson went though a very well publicized tragedy...when her mother and family were shot and KILLED! So, you would think she would release a cathartic album about love and loss and letting go and pain...but instead, the lead single is a ghetto, pop song called \\"Where You At?\\"...a song about a thug doing her wrong. What a missed opportunity to sing a beautiful ballad about grief which was relatable and believeable!    It's not really Jennifer's fault, but the songs she has been given are really mediocre and just not catchy. Such a shame! She should be singing stuff like Adele's \\"Rolling In The Deep\\"...instead, she is singing bland pop stuff, with no range, that any RnB singer could sing. Someone give this girl a ballad she can really belt out!
0316056863|3.0|As a big fan of 30 Rock, I looked forward to reading this book, especially given the excellent reviews. I found the book somewhat disappointing. Fey's stories of youthful summer theater, getting her period, working a dead-end job at the Y, all seemed a bit derivative to me. It was almost as if she pressed some buttons: insert here some weird roommate story, here a sexual awkwardness tale, here the obligatory getting-to-know-you stories about gay and lesbian friends, stir it up, and make a book.<br /><br />However, the behind-the-scenes showbiz tales are priceless, especially the ones about how 30 Rock is put together and about the Sarah Palin impression on SNL. Fey wears the mantle of celebrity lightly, and she's never afraid to laugh at herself or to wonder just how she got where she is now.<br /><br />In addition, Fey makes some very valid points about subtle discrimination against women in the entertainment world. The myth is that \\"women aren't funny\\" or that men won't watch shows about women unless they're sex objects. Fey has gone a long way to shatter those myths, and she has done it her usual way -- with humor.
B0047Y17P2|2.0|I've read all Connelly's books. His early books are really good.  By comparison, the characters \\"The Fifth Witness\\" are dull and the book grinds.  It seems to me that with his newer books he's just writing to meet publisher deadlines. Disappointed to say the least and I'm a Connelly fan.
B003R4ZMNQ|1.0|If this isn't the epitome of bad film making then what is? Not to mention it is a remake of a series that was excellent, given the time it was made. This gaudy, over-graphic, piece of crud-Chevrolet-Camaro owned excuse for the adventures and white-horse exploits of Five-O belongs in the waste can. Scott Caan couldn't act if his life depended on it, he is the worst stone-faced dullard on the small screen. His boss is played by an actor who belongs on a game show - he certainly isn't old or seasoned enough the lead the Five-O. The only two cast members worth their Kona are the native girl and native detective that at least have a clue in pretending there is a story, which is not only lost, but can;t be found - because there isn't one. This is so typical of our illustrious broadcast networks (CBS, NBC, ABC, Fox) programmers - no wonder cable has risen beyond them. This shameful remake is he same old junk coming from that centuries-old \\"just make it fast, flashy, action-packed, and get GM to sponsor it and they will watch it\\" mentality from Grandpa CBS. They are like GM, too little, too late - still tasteless, clueless, and only around because the American audience is 1) brain dead, and 2) likes to watch sports. CBS got what they wanted - the 13-25 year old-testosterone-fueled boys club to watch. More like a vacant social crime than meaningful accomplishment. \\"Book 'em Dano\\" and toss away the studio key. Let McGarrett stop vomiting as he watches his once superb Five-O squad act like the teenagers they are\\". I only gave it one star because there is not a NO star rating.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Saw Dexter on CBS years ago and was hooked. When I moved I got Showtime for free and was able to watch season 5 on demand.... that was it.. I needed to see this series from the beginning. Purchased Seasons 1 and 2, but not in blu ray. The Samsung DVD 5500 that I purchased on Amazon too upconverted the DVDs so they look high def. Best show on TV!
B0034G4ORC|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this movie but I'm sorry to say that watching an ice cube melt would've been more exhilirating. As usual when having white Liberal jackasses who are motivated by political correctness in every scene where the Marine Corps Infantry 'make up' is concerned, it was absolute B.S.! For some strange reason after watching this crappy movie I had a hankerin' for tortillas and fried chicken. As far as I'm concerned this was a wasted 16 bucks.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a novel I could not put down. The character were all real and lovable in their own way, and I was drawn into their word from the first scene. Travis is so well developed, the reader feels his pain and joy as easily as the narrator, Abby's. My heart broke for this couple over and over again. Their relationship is so realistic yet over the top at the same time. These are two truly unique characters woven into a truly unique novel. The fights were a good supplement to the building relationship of Abby and Travis, while Abby's past played a more minor roll than I had expected until the last 1/4 or so of the book where the whole thing weaves together. I would say this book was worth the money, but I would also say I would gladly pay full price for a hardcover edition of this fantastic novel.

B00000K2W1|5.0|I owned this on vinyl, 8 track, cassette, and now CD. It is one of 100 or so core albums which will always be in my collection. In this particular case, I think the Greatest Hits represents a pretty good mix of her work. Sometimes anthologies don't. Here, you can hear her do rock, folk, and blues, and do them all well. Some of it is live, and you get to hear her speak a little about her life, and life in general. I don't hesitate to give it the five stars I show here.

0470932139|5.0|Writing a book about food photography is a difficult undertaking.  No matter how much \\"knowledge\\" an author gives to a reader, there's so much to photography and food styling that isn't about formulas or which setting is used on a camera.  So much of the art of food styling and photography is about how the person doing the work interprets the food.  It's about heart and creativity.  Helene somehow manages to leap over those barriers and provides a book that is not only full of wonderful technical information, but also information that will help budding stylists and photographers tap into their inner heart and creativity.  The book is crammed full of inspiration and information and has already earned a spot on my shelf that is reserved for well-worn favorites.  If you want to learn and you need a go-to resource, this is the book.

B000002KDM|5.0|In my humble opinion, this was James Taylor's best effort ever, though I would rank Sweet Baby James up there pretty high, as well. Some of the album cuts (that is, those never released as singles) are the best material here. I can't imagine anyone being unfamiliar with James Taylor, but if you a very young and don't know anything about him, just listen to some of the samples available here. He is a great artist, tells great stories in his songs. In my opinion, his early work was his best.
0596009208|4.0|I have read this book in less than a week, and it is easily readable, and easy to understand (however, you have to read it from page 1 to the end, because it is organized like that so that you cannot skip pages). I knew some OOP before I bought it, and i have done some Java from before, so i didn't find anything hard to understand. This book has helped me a lot to fill the gaps i had in OOP and Java, since everything is well explained and visualized with images and drawings.<br /><br />However, i think that this book is not for the total beginner, you have to have some experience in Java (or some other language), know at least how OOP works (this book will greatly improve how you think in OOP, and explain with example, but i think it is not beginner level, or you might need to take a longer time reading this book till you understand what is inside).<br /><br />I also found that they spend a lot pages on really unnecessary things (like puzzles with fill in the gaps, and the crosswords, that i found really useless). Also there were some pages where some very simple things were being explained on 1-2 pages, things that can go in one sentence. Also useless were the bullets, where they (shortly) repeat what we read 2-3 pages ago. However, i liked a lot the Dumb questions (similar as FAQ's on sites)where they cover up almost every \\"dumb\\" question you might have though regards what you learned, and also liked the Brain Barbell.<br /><br />So to sum it up:<br />Pros:<br />-Easy and fast to read and understand<br />-Well explained OOP<br />-Great for people with \\"some\\" experience for filling gaps<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Many pages spent for non-useful things<br />-I expected more in-depth Java, but this book is just the basics<br />-You have to read it from page 1 without skipping
B004T0XYM8|5.0|Sergio Leone was a genius.  Every frame of his films are lovingly composed, like looking at a postcard.  His use of foreground and composition is unsurpassed.  He also did not use \\"soft\\" filters or colorize.  You can see every bead of sweat, every pore on a persons face.  Henry Fonda's piercing blue eyes are incredible and he makes one of the great Western bad guys.  Sergio Leone was also not in a hurry when filming.  There is a scene at the beginning of the film where a fly is crawling around Jack Elam's face that goes on for several minutes.  It is hysterical as he tries to blow the fly off his face.  As far as the Blu-Ray goes, I never thought a film from 1968 would be the best Blu-Ray I have but they did an amazing job in restoring this great film for Blu-Ray.  Absolutely razor sharp, very little grain, and colors are fantastic.  The sound is equally incredible.  The trains, from their loud engines to the brakes squealing, sound fantastic.  All dialogue is crisp and clear.  I can't recommend this great Blu-Ray enough.  I have the DVD of this film and it doesn't compare to the Blu-Ray.
B004DMNT2W|5.0|I use a Sanyo Xacti FH1 camcorder, and this case contains my camcorder just fine, though with a bit of slack lenght-wise. But since it is nicely padded, I don't mind having the camcorder bumping a little bit inside. The build quality of the case is high, as I would expect from Lowepro's brand. I also appreciate the convertible strap that can double as a wrist strap and a belt loop. Unfortunately, I can't really leave this case on the outside of the backpack because the zipper does not seem to be very good at keeping water out. (To be fair, Lowepro never made any claim of waterproofness. I am merely pointing out that some zippers are better than the others when it comes to water penetration.)
B0034G4ORM|1.0|This movie really sucked, the action was much like playing a video game.  The story was super weak.  Aliens come across the universe and use primitive weapons.  The acting was what really stamped it, just awful.  I was really disappointed in this movie.  Bottom line: does not deliver.  Don't even rent it.<br /><br />Phil
B004R0WKNE|2.0|I see this has an average of 3 1/2 stars, but I can only give it two. If you are a really big Rachel McAdams or Harrison Ford fan, then it is probably an automatic watch, but I thought the plot did not flow well at all, and for me, was too predictable. Rachel has one great scene in a staff meeting, Harrison has some great rants. Jeff Goldblum may be the highlight of the film, his minor supporting role is so well delivered that I found myself wanting to see more of his character. The film ends predictably for me. Overall, I'd say you need some particular interest in one of the stars, or an interest in TV news production to really like this film.
0736092269|4.0|This book is a great accessory for anyone who is trying to build on some serious muscle where they need it most. It has detailed descriptions of nearly every lift one can think of as well as anatomical drawings to show which muscles will be doing the most work for each exercise. It also has some interesting sections about how to prevent injury when performing certain exercises.<br /><br />The only thing that would have made this book the perfect workout companion would have been more detailed progression drawings to demonstrate the proper form for each exercise. The book shows the typical start and end positions, but for lifts like the deadlift, everything in between can be the confusing part.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone who is looking to design their own workouts and want to individualize which muscles will be worked every day.
B004132HZS|5.0|BBC's SHerlock Holmes is truly a masterpiece. Now Sherlock Holmes is great in general, this version really brings it to the present, and gives something people can relate too. In comparison to the big screen adaptation, both deserve merit, but the big screen stay true to its roots in regard to timeline, and BBC's version did something different and almost of a gamble. However, it proves that if you take a gamble, sometimes it pays off.

Of course that reviewer's opinion is as every bit as valid as mine and that's what makes music so great. All I can say is that my official review is a virtual reverse mirror image of that persons' opinion. This album is incredible and needs to drop in the United States immediately. It's among the band's finest work period. Just listen. Nothing more needs to be said except ... Jamiroquai sounds better than ever!

B001KOFH2G|5.0|I already have two copies of this on DVD, including the Special Edition release. So, I'll write this for folks in a similar situation who know the material and story, and are just interested in the BR transfer.<br /><br />The visuals are gorgeous! While not as gritty througout as the series, the feel is still there. Some sections look a little sterile on my smaller Samsung HDTV, but on the larger Panasonic plasma, everything looks very consistent. There was no discernible jitter, and no oversharpened effect as with some other titles.<br /><br />I'm not sure the audio got anything dramatic done to it. It seemed exactly the same as on the standard-def DVDs, but that was great by itself.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven't gone through the extras yet, so I don't know if there is anything different there. I suspect this is exactly the same as the standard release.<br /><br />This disc started up and played wonderfully on my Samsung 5500, though there is a quirk where the opening Universal titles are repeated because Joss used it to fade into the actual print. You'll think you've skipped back to the start for a moment.
0751517089|2.0|The obvious greed - albeit encouraged by his employer - and the sheer incompetence of this author and felon are astounding - yet his writing tries to generate our sympathy. An unpleasant story and not a book I should have bought as it only encourages and enriches the author.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|I came across David Nicholls \\"One Day\\" when I saw the movie trailer featuring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess.  From the 3-minute preview I was given, it appeared to an offset of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  Two friends going through life together, each emotionally dependent on one another but neither one admitting it.  However, \\"One Day\\" proved to be a more intimate and in-depth novel than I was expecting.<br /><br />We first meet Emma (Hathaway) and Dexter (Sturgess) when they have a one-night stand following their college graduation.  From there, we follow both characters separately  as they adapt to adult life after college, swerving in and out of various careers and learning life lessons with significant others'.<br />Whether or not Em and Dex will finally get together is definitely a question that looms throughout the book; however, as we see both characters struggle failure and loss, our hearts become more intertwined with wanting both characters to be happy and healthy instead of just being together.<br /><br />Nicholls mastered the complexities and depth of both Emma and Dexter so much that we ache with both of them and want to comfort them in times of need.  I was expecting \\"One Day\\" to be a careless romantic story and in turn, I was given a beautiful love story of friendship, respect and loyalty.  \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" has always been a favorite of mine but I must say that I think I have a new one when it comes to love, romance and the importance of friendship.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|After The World Needs A Hero and The System Has Failed, I had assumed when Dave once again labeled his upcoming album a return to form, that he was just shooting off at the mouth again.  The previous two albums were quite heavy on the filler, with only moments of that Megadeth genius shining through.  This album essentially delivers on the promises made.  It's not that there are a plethora of standout tracks begging to be heard by fans of the band, rather, when heard in it's entirety this album is quite satisfying.  It's basically the closest Dave has gotten to Countdown To Extinction, a thrash oriented affair with plenty of catchy well placed chorus'.  \\"Never Walk Alone\\" is among the best songs Dave has written this side Youthanasia.  A well placed intro riff harkening back to Peace Sells, and a catchy chorus.  This album is pretty tasty overall, if not a bit irrelevant in regards to it's standing in the great legacy of Megadeth's back catalog.

0679735259|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a former Marine who served in the 2-4 company (check out \\"Magnificent Bastards\\"..book) He said he thought this account was one of the best books that really captured what it was like to be in Viet Nam. As we move farther and farther away from the war, it is important to be able to have accurate and candid journalism that recounts what really happened to those that served.
B0042816YK|2.0|I didn't hate it.  I do find it difficult when American actors agree to dialogue that attempts to state American stereotypes as fact.  Apparently the American idea of fun is to drink too much and then spend every evening in front of the idiot box...mmm, not terribly accurate.  The story is uninteresting.  It seems that Liz in incapable of being alone, period.  She seems to have a bad habit of expecting others to fulfil her happiness, she doesn't seem to have the ability to do the work and find it on her own.  Therefore, she inevitable ends up miserable and can't seem to figure out why.  She is a moron.  I will give credit to Roberts for allowing herself to be dumpy through almost the entire film.  And she is no longer trying to NOT use her trademark laugh, which is nice.  Overall, if I had the resources to do what she did, I would have spent my time more wisely.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|This slab of thrash metal has always gotten a bad wrap due to it's distant and echo driven production.  I always wondered why people would complain about the production of a thrash metal album.  It's true that the remastered album takes care of this problem (But the real question is; Does it sound better this way?), but I am essentially reviewing the original here, seeing as how it's been the album I have always loved. This album is home to Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, guitars and drums respectively.  Jeff doesn't quite match the fusion style of Poland, nor does he raise the bar as Friedman would soon.  And Chuck doesn't have the tasty fusion percussive chops of Gar Samuelson, nor does he have the controlled choas that Menza would soon display.  What they do offer, is a nasty gritty compliment to Dave's rough thrash playing, and it works great.  This is quite the transition album, Dave was drug addled and violent, and he found musicians to suit this albums intent well.  The album starts with the instrumental \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" and burns straight into the album highlight \\"Set The World Afire\\", a blistering track about the upcoming destruction of man at the hand of nuclear war, in fact this was Dave's first song written after his departure from Metallica.  \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" was written after the death of Cliff Burton, Mustaine's former bandmate from Metallica.  A great momentum building song, among the strongest of the bands entire catalog.  \\"Liar\\" chronicles Dave's hatred of former bandmate Chris Poland, whom hocked all of Daves instruments to get high, the hatred is seething from Dave's lips as he snarls through the song angrily.  \\"Mary Jane\\" is another highlight, another long neglected tune that Dave never plays live from his early career.  Highly reccommended stuff here for fans of Megadeth and thrash in general.  And if by chance you can get your hands on the pre-2004 remaster you are in for a real treat.
0307463745|5.0|With the benevolent candor of a friend who points out that something is lodged between your two front teeth, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson tell their readers in Rework to ignore much of the conventional wisdom offered to small business owners. Their book is at once both practical and revolutionary. Even the title is a concise statement of the major premise of the book, that \\"it's time to throw out the traditional notions of what it takes to run a business.\\"    Perhaps the greatest strength of Rework is its light-hearted, simple approach to truth. Fried and Hansson consistently convey their message with humor, logic and heart. They have arranged their book into 12 sections containing 88 pithy chapters. Nothing, from introduction to conclusion, is longer than three pages. Yet time and again readers will be tempted to share the straightforward wisdom with a friend. I know my wife tired of my continual tapping on her shoulder--and she had read the book before me!    Never does the book substitute an imaginary world concocted in Ivy League business schools for reality. The authors remain grounded in personal experience gained while operating a profitable software company through the tumultuous years from 1999 until today. They touch on issues ranging from the limited value of long-term planning to the devastating impact of corporate policies, and from the fallacy of workaholic thinking to the critical importance of trust.    One chapter admonishes readers not to worry so much about what others do. Rather than focus on copying other business models, business owners should chart their own courses, and for good reason: \\"The problem with this sort of copying is that it skips understanding.\\" Other parts of the book reflect this same advice. Business owners are better off finding their own way.    Whether you just started your company or you've been in business 20 years, you'll appreciate Fried and Hansson's down-to-earth alternative to the theoretical fluff masquerading as truth.    Rework is a Crown Business book published in 2010.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I love this book!!! From the moment I picked it up I could not put it down! And it is one of the very very rare books that has the distinction of me immediately reading it again as soon as it was finished.     Beautiful Disaster follows the passionate, wonderful and at many times dysfunctional relationship of Travis and Pigeon (I know at first I was iffy about the nick name but believe me when you are done with this book being called \\"Pigeon\\" would make you melt LOL). From beginning to end, it kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happens next. It was not the typical love triangle romance. The plot was original and wonderfully done. I could feel myself rooting for the couple as I was tugged on an emotional roller coaster of love, jealousy, frustration and heart break. OMG.... I can't even describe. All I can say is read it!!!     This is one of those books where you are not just told how the characters feel, you actually feel how they feel. You feel the uncertainty, anger, euphoria, and betrayal of the characters right on with them. And while sometimes you want to just slap the characters and tell them to wake up and realize they are perfect for each other (especially Abby) The author manages to make the tension and conflict to where if you do not always agree with the charcters, you still love them. This book shows that love is not always perfect and easy but it is beautiful.    Seriously, READ IT!!!

B004V2S4SS|4.0|I love this show. My husband and daughters, and sometimes my son, and I watched it faithfully the whole seven years. The concept of a woman and her daughters all being psychics who can see ghosts and have dreams that tell the future--I really liked all of that. The mystery every week was fun to try and guess whodunnit. It was a game my husband and kids and I played to see who made the best guess.<br /><br />But above all else we loved the family. My two favorite characters were the middle daughter, Bridget, and the husband, Joe. Oh, Joe! The perfect husband. A great dad. A loving, supportive husband who also stood up to his wife when she was behaving badly. He had it all.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!<br /><br />I will never forgive the writers and producers of this show for what they did to Joe. It was just a horrible, horrible thing to do to loyal fans. They had to know how much we loved Joe.<br /><br />When I rewatch this season, I will skip that last show entirely and pretend it never happened, like the ending for the movie the [[ASIN:B00000JLWW Titanic]].

B000MRA5EM|4.0|This is fairly short for a documentary, but it contains a good amount of information, and if you're a fan of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, you'll enjoy learning from them. Also, great underwater footage!
0307454541|5.0|I tried reading this book 3 different times and couldn't get past the first chapter. I found it to boring and gave up. I am glad I tried a fourth time because I became hooked a few chapters in! What a great book with wonderful characters! I am now on the third book, I am glad now that I choose to pick this book up and try again it is a must read.

B00425S1H8|5.0|purchased this unit in order to hook up and program an innovate lm1 wideband oxygen sensor. worked perfectly.    this is compatible with windows xp, you have to install the drivers from the included cd rom prior to use, windows xp will not automatically supply drivers. once the driver has been installed, worked flawlessly for my needs.    if you're going to program an innovate lm-1 you can use this instead of the $30 adapter innovate sells (in combination with their cable that runs from the lm 1).    imagine this is the only thing i'll use this for but cable appears to be good quality and would probably meet other needs for adding a serial port via usb.
0316044695|5.0|Even if you aren't an avid reader you won't be able to put this book down. I have finished about 6 books as an adult. Sad I know. I kept hearing folks rave about this book so I bought it and it was an amazing read. Buy it now!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and let me tell you, it was amazing. I have looked at some of these reveiws and they are wrong if they are not saying five stars. This sci-fi movie surprises you and totally changes your thoughts about what a good alien movie is.Battle Los Angeles is one of those movies that you will hear about for a long time beacause it is the best movie of the decade.
0060936223|5.0|I have to say this is one of the best books I have read. She will take you on her journey and you will get a great insight of what she went through. You will see the close love and friendship of Patti and Robert. This book is a classic and will stay on my shelf forever. I totally respect her and her talent. The pictures in this book is excellent. You will laugh, cry, and be with her each step of the way. If you read only one book this year let this be the one. I loved it so much I had to buy her music as well. Which you can find here on Amazon. Take a journey with Patti and enjoy.
B000V5TV22|5.0|I hooked this up to my laptop running Win7 pro and using the included software to configure it, it simply works (using streets & trips 2011). The initial satellite discovery took longer than I expected, but after that, it has hooked up prettty fast. The usb cable included should be sufficiently long for pretty much everybody.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|Love these alien invasion movies...is it perfect...well no...but it will be stored<br />right beside Independance day..Skyline..Mars attack and many more other invasion<br />movies.<br />This movie gives us the perspective of following soldiers in battle and is done<br />pretty good. The first minutes of the film, shows us the characters and prepares<br />us for the movie by giving us a feel of the units. Most hand held camera shots<br />works, but because all of the shots in the beginning are hand held, some of these<br />shots looses their emotional glue on what we see because of the shaky camera.<br /> Like most wars, its easy to blow things up from the sky, but when you bring the<br />battle to the ground level, different tatics are needed.  The aliens are pretty<br />good, and have pretty good firepower and causes damage. I guess some people<br />taught these alien to have super super powers...but no...they are limited to<br />the firepower of their weapons and their drone and...... see the movie.<br />A Keeper...good for multiple views.
0553584537|4.0|I had checked out _Love You More_ from the library and of course, it had a huge waiting list so could not be renewed.  I just put my name on it again, and went to the stacks and found her first (I believe) novel, called _Alone._  It was slow starting out, and I almost gave up, but I persevered and I am glad  that I did, because it was a good read.  It was very difficult to reveal who the bad guys were, and I really felt bad for the hero,  Bobby.  It was set up that he was a wonderful, dedicated state trooper, and after his first sniper action, became confused, depressed, PTSD riddled man who had to wonder the cost of being a straight shooter (pun intended).  Without letting too much info out, the heroine of future books, D.D. Warren, was introduced; she let Bobby know in no uncertain terms what she thought about his unortodox actions.  There was a beautiful woman who was emotionally distressed, and a huge family secret that combined to make a good read.  You will enjoy this writing.  I will try her other titles as the summer goes by!
0865479186|3.0|We're on the same side Mr. Goldacre.<br />That being said, I was a little disappointed in the way the author presents the subject. For example, his knocking of homeopathy and charlatan \\"science\\" frequently devolves into ad hominem. This is wholly unnecessary; we have the upper hand because science is on our side. Additionally, the author's style of writing is abrasively arrogant, which, is distracting. Most importantly, though, this book does little to promote critical thinking skills. The author spoon-feeds us the secret to the \\"magic\\" of those ludicrous  detox foot pads without properly explaining why it sounds fishy, and the consequences of taking similar products' claims on its word. The reader may be left skeptical of homeopathy and the like (a good start) but lack the ability to personally assess *why* its claims are bogus and the science behind it.<br /><br />Overall, however, the book was a interesting read. The reason I had to give 3.5 stars is the subject matter is *so* important that I have to hold this work to a very high standard. If you're interested in the *value* of skepticism and how to apply it generally, might I suggest \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" (Sagan)?  If you want to learn more about how statistics can be misleading... well, I'm currently reading \\"How To Lie With Statistics\\" (Huff) and a review is forthcoming.

B004UHF51S|5.0|Finally the wait is over, and our day is filled with this lyrical bliss by Michael Franks.  Just surrender to the Tao of Franks' juicy, tangy and spicy melodies, rhymes and rhythms and allow yourself to be gifted with the ken of his unique, mysterious ministrations to passion and pain in poem song all dished up in a sensuous, summery selection to savor under the wisteria blossoms with a glass of good wine, your favorite cat in your lap, a well-tuned bio-receiver in your head, and your glad and broken heart. Michael Franks doesn't sell us music. He bewitches us as he somehow tunes us in to the very songs our own hearts and minds, if only they could, would sing all the day long \\"through this quicksand of time.\\"  He and his collaborators in song are, once again here with \\"Time Together\\", nothing short of impeccable.  Now I have the perfect gift to buy for everyone I know. Thanks again Michael, et al. We once more face all the summer days at the lake, caught spellbound by your lovely magic.
0061726826|3.0|Delirium had a very strikingly interesting dystopia. I loved (pun intended) everything about it down the minutiae that Ms. Oliver threw in that I would never have thought of in a million years. The world was intricately and carefully woven so completely that I definitely felt that in some ways it could happen in our world given the right motivations. Which can be difficult where dystopias are concerned. This world felt authentic and well thought out.<br /><br />That said, I really did not like the narrator of this story. That's not a negative comment on the writing of the character because she was very fleshed out and complete as a person. I felt she was very well developed and never seemed to stray out of character with one exception that may or may not just have to do with my personal dislike of her in general. I struggle reading narrow-minded protagonists. There isn't anything wrong with them -- there are people out there who always think inside the box and believe whatever is told to them is what is right. I personally don't like to read stories from their point of view though. I would have rather read this story from Hannah's point of view.<br /><br />The rest of the characters are well written and I think they all work in their own niches. Even the party goers and rule enforcers, what little we see of them, are given some personality as Lena interacts with them. I would have liked to have seen a little more of Lena's mother in interaction with Lena in memories as opposed to just being told by Lena what happened with her.<br /><br />I would also have liked to have seen a little more of an interesting love interest. I felt that Alex was a little too vanilla and boy next door to inspire someone as dead set on conforming to the society's norms to break away from that as completely as she appears to do. He was really nice but I felt no spark with the two of them. It was just nice.<br /><br />Unfortunately as well, there felt like there were a few scenes that could have been left out of this story to make it feel a lot tighter as a story. It sort of meanders in a couple of places and begins to feel like the scenes were written to make the book longer. They didn't seem to further the plot, the world building, or the character development.<br /><br />By the time the book reached its climax and ended I wasn't emotionally invested enough in the characters to have a big reaction for which I'm sorry. This book got a lot of coverage and I know there are going to be a lot of people who really loved it. I didn't love it but it was a pretty good read. I hope the next in the series hits a bit stronger. I'll definitely read it!to make it feel a lot tighter as a story.

B003L20ICE|5.0|I'm an Annette Benning fan.  She really showed that she can potray anybody and anything and do it well.  I loved her in this movie.  This movie is funny but also delicate in it's subject matters.  I loved the movie and it's a must have for your home.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The fourth season of this hit show is amazing. I began watching right from the first season and have been purchasing them since it all began! I have seen each episode the first night it was aired on TV and probably half a dozen times since then. It is a show, that in my opinion, can be seen over and over. Definitely a must have if you are continuing your Dexter collection. A show that should be seen right from the very start. Enjoy the product! Worth every penny!
B004XUD762|5.0|The Song Remains Not the Same is a beautiful new album from Black Label Society.  This album shows Zakk Wylde's talent in being able to take hardcore songs from The Order of Black and turn them into unplugged beautiful ballads. In addition the mixture of Darkest Days with John Rich shows how open minded Zakk is toward other types of music. The cover songs are exceptional and I believe are better than the originals.  Thank you Zakk, BLS and John Rich for giving us yet another excellent album.

B004ZH66XO|2.0|I felt the fish was slow to respond, and your finger gets in the way of seeing what you are trying to do. I only played 2 parts and gave up on the controls. My HTC EVO ran it just fine, it was just the &quot;follow my finger&quot; controls I found hard to see around.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I saw this in theaters on opening day and I did enjoy it. What amazed me was the critics reviews. Not so much that I thought they should have given it praises for best picture, but I thought that for some reason they figured there was so much substance that they never received as a viewer. I thought the film was nothing but effects and action and nothing more and thats why I enoyed sucker punch.
B004I11VZA|3.0|I do think that the first film was better. I thought the English cast was horrible, they were overly dramatic but couldn't act at all. The story was relatively shallow in comparison to the firt film. The bluray is visually stunning though, no complaints on the technical aspect. I just wished we in the US didn't have to wait while they release this series of films so slowly when they have been out for years! WHY?!?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best android games.  Makes you want to play one more level.  Runs great on Epic 4g.  If you like this one, also try Guns and Glory.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I've been a huge Jane Eyre fan since I first read it as a little girl quite a few years ago. I've seen countless adaptations of the years. some of them I absolutely loved and quite a few of them I hated, but this particular adaptation is by far the best. The visuals are incredible, the score is eerie, and the acting is superb. For the first time in any adaptation, this film truly encompasses the magnanimity of a very young girl's introduction to attraction and sexuality that is so subtly prevalent in the novel. It is, in every sense, a film adaptation of a haunting English romance that is absolutely perfect.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|In thirty years of reading, I somehow missed reading this book (or anything by Austen).  If I hadn't been trying to fill my new Kindle with free books, I don't know if I ever would have read it.  There were too many movie adaptations that held zero interest for me and too many rip-offs from authors unable to imagine their own characters and wanting to pick up where Austen had left off.  I didn't think that this book would have anything for me.  I was too cool for Jane Austen.<br /><br />I was wrong.  Austen is amazingly witty and the romance of Elizabeth and Darcy is one of the sweetest and realistically character-driven I've ever read.  Despite the setting, the two of them are so well-imagined as to achieve a kind of timelessness.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you've never read Austen before.<br /><br />As far as Kindle editions go, this isn't one of the best.  There are some weird line breaks.  The typos and repeated words mentioned in earlier reviews seem to be fixed, but any word with emphasis in the original is all caps in this edition -- it's a bit like reading an over-heated chat room discussion at first, but I got used to it.

B00081912E|5.0|I am a huge Jim Carrey fan and I have been looking for The Mask in stores for a long time now. Seeing it on Amazon for such a great price gave me a reason to buy! The minute I received it, I popped it into the DVD player and had some laughs. There were so many jokes I had forgotten and it renewed my love for classic comedy :) Thanks Amazon!
B0034G4ORM|5.0|This film is similar to Independence Day with a more gritty, military, District 9-type feel to it.  I thought the story moved well.  The characters were believable. There's not too much to be expected as far as a story goes - it's a pure alien invasion movie and about us fighting back, e.g. Independence Day.  So, for the genre, I thought the story did well.  It's pretty much action all the way through.  The 2 hours flew by pretty fast.
B004GHNHVW|5.0|Probably not at the same level as Graceland but better than the terrific Rhythm of the Saints. There are at least two songs (\\"Getting ready for Christmas Day\\" and specially \\"Dazzling Blue\\") which seem destined to become classics.  It's never a bad sign when you absolutely love an album upon the very first play. Sublime.
0307454541|5.0|At first, I wondered: how do I write a review for a book like this?<br /><br />One thing I knew for sure: it's a certain five-star novel.  It is full of conspiracy, revelation, tension, derring-do, sex, intriguing characters, thrills, corruption, honor, passion, morality, and whatever else you're likely to find in any other book ten times the length.  Ironically, what I really wanted to call it is \\"one of a kind,\\" but I probably can't; Larsson has written two others (at least--more about that later) that I haven't yet read.<br /><br />What this is at first glance is long...about 650 pages.  And it takes some time to finish this novel, to be sure, but it also reads \\"quick\\": the book is written in such a fashion that it zips along.  That's even more remarkable given the fact that a big chunk of the story is about  a disgraced journalist who investigates the possible misdeeds of a Swedish financier.  Sounds pretty dull, huh?<br /><br />Well, it's not.<br /><br />What MOST of the plot concerns is a forty year old disappearance, and probable murder, of a young girl...a case that is almost entirely absent of worthwhile clues.  It's an assignment that is numbingly difficult for Mikael Blomkvist--the tarnished journalist who has taken leave from his struggling magazine--until he hires a young female research assistant who is unlike any character you have ever met before.<br /><br />It is this girl-- Lisbeth Salander--who makes this book such a stand out.  She looks like a child, is heavily tattooed, is well under 100 pounds, hacks into computers, is a ward of the state, and carries a chip on her shoulder as big as an iceberg .  She is the backbone of this novel, and the reason it's a best-seller.  She is on one hand a person who you'll want so much to protect, and on the other so self-sufficient you would never want to cross her.  It is to Larsson's credit that she jumps off the pages: she is a unique and powerful individual who seems capable of anything, yet is so utterly realistic that she could be anyone you'd meet on the street...on the rougher side of the tracks.<br /><br />She is the \\"outsider\\" here in more ways than one, as much a stranger in a strange land as others judge her to be.  A hardened cynic even at her tender age, she feels she has the world figured out--that is, until she meets Blomkvist, a flawed but decent man twice her age.<br /><br />It is how these various characters struggle that makes this book so compelling.  There are many points at which I noticed how this book moved in markedly different directions than most books would have, and it is this unique approach to characterization, plot, and toward solutions that makes it so unusual.  Larsson takes his time developing his story and his people, and as a result events and people come across as convincingly as they do.<br /><br />I've read that Larsson had more or less completed a fourth novel, but a dispute over publishing and profits has derailed it for at least the time being--a real shame, given this book's potential.  I would like to think it will someday see the light of day, but then maybe that's a mystery that's not immediately solvable, by me at least.anyone you'd meet on the street...on the rougher side of the tracks.

009193768X|5.0|Fortnum and Mason is one of my favorite shops in the whole world. I love everything about them, especially the Teas and delicious confections. I bought this book not really knowing how well the recipes would translate, but boy am I glad I did. Living in the USA it costs a pretty penny to have items shipped to me from the UK. With this book I've been able to recreated some of my favorite items in my own kitchen. the recipes really do turn out just like the store product. I've had so many great comments on the rose biscuits, which is an absolute favorite of mine as well. The recipes are in British measurements, but they are easy enough to convert. This book also has a really interesting read on the history of the store. It is also nice and compact. A tiny little book full of timeless recipes.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD stands out in a simple, basic way. While I play any other concert DVD on rare occasions, I've played this one many times since its release; and will continue to do so. If you don't care for the Eastern music, it's easy to bypass, and the DVD is still worth every moment and the cost. Just be sure to catch Jeff Lynne joining them for \\"The Inner Light\\". While having been a fan of The Beatles music since day one, I wasn't a huge fan of George's solos in the early days. This concert brings those songs - and his later music - into an entirely different light. The performers didn't short-cut anything. Their performances - and the quality of the DVD re-production is second to none. The best way for me to describe the music is to go back to the very first time I saw/heard it. When McCartney started to play \\"Something\\" on a ukelele - solo - it was deflating & disheartening. How could you subject such a beautiful song, with all those great musicians present, to a freaking ukelele solo?!?!?! But the best was yet to come. One by one, as the song progressed, the other musicians became part of the song. It became the most powerful and beautiful piece of music I ever witnessed. By the end of \\"Something\\" tears were streaming down my face; and I am not one prone to that type of reaction. To this day, years later, it still has the same affect on me. This concert DVD stands out all by itself. And I can't think of  a close second.

0393316041|4.0|Recommend for anyone interested in learning about an infectiously curious, free-spirited adventurer.<br /><br />==============================<br /><br />Curiosity - is this something we're taught to lose over our 'growth' in the educational systems of today?  When did YOU stop asking those questions that made you giggle and squeal when you were younger?<br /><br />Mr. Feynman is a very curious man and it has lead him through so many different facets of life.  This book runs you through quite a few of his (mis)adventures where he always has a bit of fun and (more importantly) always learns a lesson... with the occasional teaching a lesson.<br /><br />The form of this book, a bunch of mashed together anecdotes, bugged me a bit - it seemed more like 30 short stories in a binder.  However, I have a sneaking suspicion that Mr. Feynman studied Ericksonian storytelling in his adventures with hypnosis... some of these stories are *golden* in this regard.<br /><br />It's lacking polish - but it's a good read about a dynamo of a man.<br /><br />==============================<br /><br />Listened to the audiobook my local library offers for free!

B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech was based upon a true story. It was a remarkable story of King George VI's struggle against his personal demons told during the time that he and the greatest generation fought the overwhelming demons of the Axis powers that were out to subjugate the entire world. King George VI (played by Colin Firth) who was forced to make public speeches, has to give his trust to a commoner speech therapist, Lionel Logue (played by Geoffrey Rush) to help him overcome his stuttering problem, a great struggle and embarrassment to him. As you may know, the movie won 4 Oscars including best picture, best actor, best director, and best original screenplay.     The special features on the DVD are excellent. First is a feature commentary by director Tom Hooper in which he explains the story behind the story and the significance during each scene. There is another 20+ minute segment that summarizes the remarkable story, a Q&A with the director and cast, as well as an interview with the grandson of Lionel Logue, who had the diary and papers of his grandfather.         For those who are looking for a real way to heal stuttering (or dyslexia), they should consider Donna Eden's works including [[ASIN:1585426504 Energy Medicine: Balancing Your Body's Energies for Optimal Health, Joy, and VitalityUpdated and Expanded]] and [[ASIN:B002M2MNT0 The Energy Medicine Kit [With 43 Energy, Medicine Cards and 1-Inch Cut Glass Crystal and CD and DVD and 28-Page Booklet] [ENERGY MEDICINE KIT]]].

B0042U2HLY|5.0|Was looking to expand my classical collection recently and bought this set.  Had built up a decent collection from the usual cast of characters (Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Sibelius, ...) when I first got into classical music about 10 yrs ago.  My commute changed along with my listening habits until recently when I decided to expand my symphonic horizons a bit. I bought the Dvorak/Suitner set which I thoroughly enjoyed, then decided to go with this set (primarily for the price but also good reviews) and my life has changed forever, although more so for the composer than conductor.<br /><br />How could this composer have eluded me for so long?  I guess I had come to the conclusion that it was Beethoven then everyone else, but not anymore.  At 49 I wasn't expecting such a revelation!  My wife and kids think I've lost my mind.  I've added sets from Karajan, Furtwangler and many others from Tintner, Bohm, Horenstein, Celibidache, etc.<br /><br />I've enjoyed reading every last Bruckner review here which have been most helpful in satisfying my new addiction.  There are many opinions out there re: conductors and orchestras.  The only real conclusion I've drawn (other than I absolutely adore this composer) is that I don't like my Bruckner too fast, and Wand does an excellent job with tempo, at least to my ears.  I've added the Wand/BPO 4th and 8th to my collection which are also well reviewed and deservedly so.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, you probably haven't \\"found\\" Bruckner yet.  Do yourself a favor and buy this set.  I won't say its well worth the price because that's the understatement of the century.  This set is a great start on a wonderful journey of numerous interpretations of numerous versions of the most beautiful music ever written!<br /><br />8/28 update: Thought I should add something regarding this cycle.  After hearing more and more recordings you get a sense of what feels \\"right\\" (kind of like Goldilocks).  No one can say for certain what Bruckner's intentions were or which conductor best interprets those intentions but to me Wand delivers consistency across the entire cycle, not in the dull, predictable sense, but in performances that feel \\"just right\\".  Of course it's all subjective but I find myself coming back to many of these fine recordings, esp. 2, 5, 6, 8.best interprets those intentions but to me Wand delivers consistency across the entire cycle, not in the dull, predictable sense, but in performances that feel \\"just right\\".

B004VFYOA2|3.0|I think Whitesnake's Slip of the Tongue CD is a hard rock materpiece.  Steve Vai added his fire and charm to the band's music already kicking into hard rock territory, pulling away from their blues / rock roots.  When Steve was invited to tour with the band on the Slip of the Tongue Tour Whitesnake peaked as a Live act, going on an exhaustive 1989 - 1990 tour, headlining everywhere.  Oddly enough, there is not ONE professionally filmed concert or show.  The band's day at Donnington was caught on video monitor cameras and Sir David quickly confiscated all camera tapes after the concert avoiding bootlegs to appear afterwards.  So with great anticipation and some low quality boots over the the last 20 years of the Vai-era Snake to whet our appetites, The Cov finally let his guard down and releases Whitesnake Live at Donnington 1990 en masse.   D.C. was quick to say take it for what it is during any promotion behind the release, and if you keep that in mind while watching it you'll enjoy it.  No it's not a professionally filmed concert, yes the video screens show many, and I mean many shots of Vai soloing but the camera is on Vandenberg, and vice-versa, etc., etc..  It's cool to see this, but the question is is it worth repeated viewings?  My answer is no.  Once is cool, but afterwards, there is no more visual excitement.  If you pick up the 2cd / 1 dvd set for a few more bucks then each of the stand alone releases than it's worth having, but if you can't afford both, then definitely pick up the cds only.  The sound quality is fantastic, the video imaging and quality is sub-par.  There was a reason this took 20 years to release, and quite honestly, the video part could stay in the vault.
1608191664|2.0|First of all, Chang is not giving you a comprehensive explanation for his argues and those are very vague. I consider myself more as a Marxist and thought this book would give me deeper insight to faulty mechanism of capitalism. Unfortunately this was not the case, I have to agree with Mr. Harrison. The fun thing is that Chang considers himself as a neutral approacher to this subject (what he definitely is not).    For example, one Chang´s argue is that most people in rich countries are paid more than they should be. He gives an example of Swedish and Indian bus drivers, where Swedish drivers are paid 50 times more than Indian drivers. He tries to run down the capitalism by influencing the reader of productivity and wage -theory stating that there is no difference between productivity between Swedish and Indian drivers. Correct, but he does not even account the purchasing power of salaries in different countries. The only thing that prevents the Indian bus driver going to drive bus in Sweden is the limited immigration by government of Sweden (and that is one thing which make \\"free market\\" -theory to collapse). Is this the case?    One example of capitalism is, that selfish thinking is the best way to foster capitalism. Chang argues this is not the case because altruism is the key for success. There might be a point but he did not manage to convince that. He is telling example of altruistic behavior that can be countered easily by anyone. Or do you think people pay for the taxi trip just because they are altruistic? In big cities they could run away and probably not meet the driver again. Ok, fine but slightly vague example of altruism behavior.    And there are lots of more of these. If you believe Chang´s examples and arguments were good, then you might like it. But if you are seriously looking for more absolute insight to this subject, you might want to skip this.
0060558121|2.0|Just thought I would throw my lot in with the negative reviews here. I read constantly, and can probably count on two hands the books I started but never finished. American Gods finds a place on that prestigous list. As others have noted, the main character is unrealistic and poorly developed, the storyline wanders, events lack punch, the personification of the gods seem inappropriate. I found the little back-story exerpts of old gods out of place and awkward. And after reading that the ending is a let-down, the only good thing about this book is that I didn't waste the time finishing it.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|Not many artist seek to push the boundaries of pre- recorded music hits( any form really, including the Broadway stage or ballet). There's a risk the public won't respond to fresh takes on the same passion that inspired the piece. History and Science will continue to evolve and so should we, and  the art form as well. I had no agenda as I unwrapped this CD, what a unexpected treat this is. It's beautiful, every track. Rob Mathes and the Royal  Philharmonic Orchestra enriched this music to the level of fine wine, great classical art, a gourmet meal. I'm not familiar with Jo Lawry whom  provide accompanying vocals on most of the songs but she simply lifted Sting's tenor to a surprising softer but edgy collaboration. Whether you  enjoy the Royal Philharmonic orchestra as I do, or a fan of Sting as I am, schedule time to savor this music. Now I have another musician   to give props to, Joni Mitchell , Mr. Sting has joined the club.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I am by no means any kind of expert on the Blues, even as a native Floridian for 41 years (yes we *are* a part of the South thankyouverymuch). But I know what I like when I listen to music. And this album has earned a place in my favorites.<br /><br />Yes, I am a die-hard House and Hugh Laurie fan. I watch the show. I write fan-fic. I read The Gun Seller and wept metaphorically when a proposed second novel was scrapped. So there was no question that I would buy the album. I balked at the US price so I headed over to the UK site--got my album today (listening to it now). Of course now Amazon US has dropped the price, a very wise move. And when the special set comes out next month, I'll probably purchase that as well. Yes I adore Hugh Laurie *that much*.<br /><br />So back to my lack of knowledge....I do play piano, have taught it, and so I can appreciate the piano talent of Laurie, who from the liner notes, appears to have only taken lessons for a few months, so I assume the rest is self-taught. I have to admire such a beautiful sound and touch on the keys which obviously comes naturally to him. I've read some negativity because \\"he's a star\\". Well, so what? If his fame affords him the ability to do what he so passionately loves--and he's mentiond that the 8th season of House may be the last because he wants to get back to music--then good for him. That he shares this with his fan is but a thankyou/love letter to us. And to Laurie, I say, thank you. I may never be a blues fan, but this album gives me a sweet taste of it, and a better appreciate for the talent that is Blue Eyes Hugh Laurie. Good medicine, indeed.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Triangle deals with eternal recurrence where there is no death only the recurrence of the sames events eternally without change,the myth of Sisyphus also alludes to recurrence. In ancient Greece the belief was that at Death the deceased found themselves in the netherworld on a Riverbank of the River Styx awaiting Charon The Ferryman to appear to take them over the River Styx to the Land Of The Dead (No Return). In order to Take the Dead over to the Other Side the Dead Had To Pay The Ferryman with an Obelos(Coin) Which Was Placed in the Mouth Of The Dead At Death. Little known but believed by the Ancient Greeks and taught by the Stoics is that one could Return and Live Your Own Life Again From Birth to Death. In Order to Do this you had to Drink the Waters Of Another River Called The Lethe the River of Forgetting. The idea was that you would drink the Waters and you would Go Back and Live Your Life Again having forgotten that You Had Lived Your Life Before. Anthony Peake goes into the hard science and neurology of how this occurs in our lives or rather death.  Similar themed films include Slaughterhouse 5, Groundhog Day and also some Twilight Zone episodes. Sparing repetition of other reviewers it is a well acted and directed film on a budget. I picked that it was Australia and not the USA where it was filmed ie the houses, sprinkler, streets, car (even though left hand drive and right side driving) so the location people could have done some more research to convince us that it really was the USA. Thoroughly Recommended Viewing
0452286751|5.0|First of all I was gripped by the incredible ingenuity in the construction of this plot, as well contrived as any I have read, and mostly much better. The story is a classic one man versus the mob, and absolutely riveting. I enjoyed this book far more than the shaggy dog, Atlas Shrugged, which struck me as a novel that had gotten out of its writer's grip. But the Fountainhead is a marvelously fun read.
0765350386|5.0|I picked up Mistborn because I had just finished reading Sanderson's The Way of Kings and I was captivated with Sanderson's writing. I wanted more and I was not disappointed! In some small ways Mistborn falls short of TWoKs and I was slightly disapponted in it during the first couple of chapters. But I knew Mistborn was written before TWoKs and I'd heard it wasn't quite as mature. I knew I had to keep that in mind when reading it. I'm glad I stuck with it because it was well worth it. By the end of the first book (The Final Empire) I was throughly drawn into the story and captivated by the characters.     Sanderson does a great balancing characterization with action and plot. While at times the characters could be a bit cliche the story was just so intriguing I forgave it. The story is like nothing you've ever read before. The world Sanderson has built is unique and the \\"powers\\" of the characters are different and interesting.    I'm totally hooked on Sanderson now. The man is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy genius!
B004HYGF18|4.0|Britain always seem to give birth to a few new exiting new bands every year. The Vaccines are the next in the list with their fun and short album \\"What Did You Expect From The Vaccines?\\". Did we expect a 1:22 rolling song? Well I didn't but it's a great start to the album that is full of youthful energy.  The album is full of relatively easy songs with incredibly catchy sing-along choruses in double choruses reminiscent of the Fratellis. Most of their influences seem to lie in New York however. The Ramones and sixties Brill Building give a fresh vibe that's hard to miss. The Ramones of the 21st century The Strokes aren't missed either in the suave `A Lack of Understanding\\". That's it's not just punk and post-punk is clear in the fragile `Wetsuit' with it's thumping drums and vocal lines could be a Vampire Weekend song.  This is a fine debut, fun, fresh and short. Don't expect anything new but if you want a happy 30 minutes in your life this album is for you.
B004UHF51S|5.0|Twenty-one albums and thirty-eight years of being one of the most brilliant wordsmiths in the world of music, and now he's managed to outdo himself on his 22nd release... TIME TOGETHER. Michael Franks, the man who captured our attention and delighted us with \\"Popsicle Toes\\" in 1976, still knows how to touch us emotionally, from his whimsical and playful first single, \\"Now That the Summer's Here\\" to the sweet and deeply touching title song... a memorial to his beloved pet Dachshund, Flora. The intelligent wit, wisdom, and biting commentary are all here in this new album, together with the romance and imagery we've come to expect and to cherish from Mr. Franks... tempered with perhaps a heightened wistfulness that's borne out of the passage of time, and best expressed in \\"If I Could Make September Stay.\\" Bravo, Michael Franks! TIME TOGETHER embraces beautifully all that we love about your music! ~SCOTT O'BRIEN
0307454541|3.0|I read this book after hearing so much about it and I was intrigued by the fact that the author passed away before his book went to print. I must admit that I was a little disappointed. It took forever to get to the exciting part. So much detail...a little too much for my taste. An ok read, but a little overrated in my opinion.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|A very well thought out game with different engaging levels making it highly addictive and entertaining! Works very well on the HTC inspire and the game is a steal for the price!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Love this game, graphics are great. I just wish the game was complete. I have to wait weeks after mastering a section till for the new one to be available. This last update (6/14) didn't do anything for me. I was expecting level 8, but nothing changed. Did I do something wrong?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I made the serious error of starting this book at 11PM, just looking for a little light reading before bed. 300 pages later at 4AM I realized I with a start how late it was. I've proabably read something like 40 book in the last year, this was the only one where there weren't long stretches where I just had to slog through to get to something interesting. It was very engrossing. I haven't found a page turner like this in years. It's not what I'd call serious reading, but it's a great book to escape into. I found myself caring about the characters in way that's hard to find. I see why it's been in the Amazon Top 100 for so long.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is good quality. A great story with a good feeling at the end. I don't like the scene of swearing but I guess I will let go of that Because everything else was great. For kids to see this is okay But make sure to fast forward the cursing part.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is not the type of book I usually read, but it was recommended to me about a month ago.  So I downloaded it and was instantly hooked.  The story keeps moving, keeping the reader from putting the book down.  It's a little predictable, but that's okay.  I downloaded book 2 before I finished this one, and will probably buy the third and final book in this series soon too.  I can't wait to see what happens to Katniss next. So I'm ending my review now, and going to start the second book....
B002HWRYJE|5.0|UNLIKE MANY OTHER DVD DISCS, THIS ONE PLAYS OVER & OVER, WITHOUT DEVELOPING ANY SKIPS OR STOPS. THE MOVIE WILL BE IN MY LIBRARY FOR YEARS, IT WAS THAT GOOD.

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the popular, Hunger Games series.  Katniss and Peeta have finally made it out of the Hunger Games alive together.  This has never been done before, there has always only been one winner.  By almost committing suicide at the same time through the poisonous berries at the very end of the games, some seem to think Katniss was making some kind of a statement.  Panem's leader, President Snow is furious about this outcome, leaving many fearing for their lives or dead.  Rebellion is whispered around the districts and is confirmed when President Snow privately speaks with Katniss and threatens her life if she does not do something to stop it.  He seems to know all of Katniss' true feelings and she realizes that her every move is being watched and followed.  She somehow has to figure out where this rebellion is coming from, why the mockingjay symbol is so important, and how she can get Peeta out of it all alive.<br />This book is nerve-racking and will leave you speechless.  It definitely takes a sharp turn in events and things happen that you would never expect.  It has some very strong, exciting, and violent chapters.  However, some parts of the book do seem to drag on a bit.  It is hard to maintain focus during parts of the book because when the characters become bored, so do you.  If you can make it through a few slow parts this book will not disappoint you.  Also, Catching fire is cruel and brutal in many ways.  It is hard to swallow sometimes, although it really helps you imagine the situation.  I would not recommend this to children, it is an adult book.

0393338827|3.0|Lewis does a fine job of telling a good story: he knows and helps us know his characters. As a story the books works pretty darn well.    There are, however, two major gaps: one is an deeper analysis of why the system was allowed to do what it did. Lewis' glib answer that making investment banks public companies was the key moment is far to simple and sidesteps completely the role of the government and paid-off lawmakers in ignoring their oversight responsibilities.    The second great lack is in application: if there are lessons to be learned from this story, Lewis isn't suggesting them. If he is unhappy that his earlier work, Liar's Poker, was read as a how-to manual for Wall Street wannabes, this book does nothing to address that concern: it tells the story of how some smart guys used the system's failings to make piles of money. The tricks they used are no longer available so what is the point going forward?    Good as entertainment, short on analysis and usefulness.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I was pleased to purchase this epic war story at a bargain price and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not quite as visceral (blood and gutsy) as the recent History Channel special, but I guess I liked that it had its more quiet, thoughtful moments too. It is considerably long, at about 4 hours, and it has many more hours of excellent extra features, including maps, a \\"making of\\" doc and a commentary track with the director, writer, cinematographer and historians. I actually spent most of a whole weekend watching it all. There is a lot to learn and enjoy.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly outstanding, especially Jeff Daniels, Sam Elliott and the too-early departed Richard Jordan. Martin Sheen seemed a bit short and pudgy for Gen. Lee, but he delivers a memorable characterization nonetheless.<br /><br />Civil War buffs can probably find issues to argue with. The writer and filmmaker focus on very specific skirmishes on each of the three days of the widely diffuse battlefield, but I think they took a good, balanced approach that highlights certain themes and tactics. All in all, I found this to be a very stirring and thoughtful war epic. It's bound to make viewers want to learn even more about Gettysburg and the Civil War overall, and that's a good thing.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|I had high hopes for this film.  The story line seemed like something that would be interesting.  I read the novel that was written for this film so I awaited the movie anxiously.<br /><br />This is obviously an ADAPTATION of the Red Riding Hood story, a far fetching, albeit quite interesting take on the story.  You have a grandmother, a wolf, red riding hood, etc.  That's about where the similarity ends.<br /><br />Catherine Hardwicke is known for her colorful, contrasting shots of cinematography and in certain places during the film she didn't disappoint.  What was hard to accept was the bad acting and incongruous script.  Valerie (Red) lost her sister to the Wolf and it was like no great emotion.  A small, blip of a mourning scene then it was life as usual.  Now perhaps it was bad editing and the raw emotions of losing her sister (this includes the parents, mind you) was left on the cutting room floor, but the acting seemed disconnected from what the characters were supposed to be feeling.  No depth, really bad flow.  Too bad.<br /><br />Gary Oldham was great, as he really always is and maybe that showed up the rest of the cast.  But it just fell flat.  You never bought into the story or the characters so it made the movie SLOOOOOWWWWWW.<br /><br />Many comparisons to Twilight I have read here.  The only connection is she directed that movie as well.  Will have to say her filming style comes through and thats the only reference you can make as these plots are dissimilar.<br /><br />All in all, rent don't buy.  And be prepared for lackluster acting and a mediocre script.  Visually quite appealing but not sure you want to invest for just that.

0439023513|1.0|I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from reading Mockingjay.  If you haven't read this third and final book of the Hunger Games trilogy, don't.  Just use your imagination and come up with an ending that you'd be happy with.  I bet it'll be much more satisfying than Mockingjay.  You'll probably feel more closure too, if you never read this final installment.  Some people have considered this ending to be \\"realistic\\", however... spoilers... people can actually be happy and find hope & things to love after they've fought in wars.  It felt to me that Suzanne Collins had an agenda, and she twisted her adventure story into a cautionary tale of the negative effects of war.  It's rather grim and unrealistic that life no longer held any happiness for Katniss.  And the whole love triangle with Peeta/Katniss/Gale?  So very frustrating and unfulfilling!  Seriously, it's as if SC couldn't decide who & how Katniss would choose, so she just destroyed all 3 characters, killing the spirits of Peeta & Katniss, and turning Gale into a bad guy.  What a cop-out.

0385335997|5.0|Danger and complicated entanglements abound in this, the 3rd in the Outlander series.  Jamie always protects or rescues Claire from terrible situations, succeeding against almost insurmountable odds.  The way he speaks to Claire of his love for her is most especially endearing. Their conversations are often humorous despite their having to live in uncomfortable conditions, and having to cope with the problems that arise from traveling with Jamie's relatives and loyal cohorts.  Gabaldon's descriptions of the landscapes, the cities etc. are always lyrical.  I am presently reading the 4th book in the series and look forward to learning more about this couple, she from the 20th century and he, a Highlander from the 18th century.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|Join us in this century all you publishers.  You don't like the e-book.  Tough.  The music industry didn't like the digital stuff either, but they changed their business model and survived.  You think you can push us to the sale you want to make but you're just losing out on cash.  When I see anything over $9.99 you lose the one chance you have of getting my money.  Library, torrents, or just having the desire to read that book fade... there are too many other options and you normally have one shot to get my cash.  Miss that and you've lost any chance of revenue from me.  You think you can price people out of buying e-readers, but now there's ipads and tablets and phones that act as e-readers.  The writing's on the wall, you won't discourage innovation with your price fixing schemes, you'll just price yourself out of the industry when some publishers that live in this century realize they can make big bucks being the first one to break your cartel.  They'll get the good authors because they can put their words in front of more eyes than you will.  And on the cycle will go until the current \\"important\\" houses are diminished to bankruptcy like the NY Times has become in a world of internet.  See your future.  You're becoming the BetaMax.

With the lights down low, his classic lullabies softly playing, ocean waves sound machine lightly swishing in the background, and me cuddling him on our rocker, we read this beloved book and say \\"night, night\\". He loves the pictures, the gentle rhythm of the verses and the soothing way I read each verse to him.

B004VFYOA2|1.0|I was anxiously looking forward to this video. I actually saw this Whitesnake line up  live concert back in 1990 when I was a baby. It was a good concert. To this day I'm a Steve Vai fan and his performance in the band gave it a twist.   I was hoping this DVD would bring back some good memories. Well? HELL NO!   This DVD is an INSULT. It is inferior on so many levels I don't know where to begin. The editing? The camera work? If a kid had an i phone to film a concert he would do a better job! Coverdale ought to be ashamed of himself for putting this piece of garbage out as an \\"official\\" release. It only makes himself and his band look BAD.Literally !  When Amazon promptly delivered this thing to my place I anxiously tore it open and put it in the DVD player. When I first saw the beginning of the first clip I was confused. Then when I realized what this VISUAL piece of trash was going to be , in fact, the whole concert experience,  I turned it off and put it away in disgust. What a waste!  I DEMAND an apology. And I want my money back. I was scammed. For you fans out there , Trust me. Don't waste your money!

067082187X|2.0|This is a truly a book by which to drive oneself mad, or so I found it.  I could go on about a million little things here evoked by spending hour upon hour reading and rereading this self-defeating novel - for that's the essential problem here, not only are the lovers self-defeating, but the work itself is - but it would be, in the end, as futile an endeavour as the book and, aside from that, Amazon limits me here to 1,000 words.<br /><br />Right.  First off, the book is full of reams of haute-bourgeoisie tittle-tattle which its defenders describe as comedic satire, but which doesn't come across as droll or biting at all.  It's simply inane.  That's the first hurdle the intrepid reader of the book will have to negotiate.<br /><br />Having thus been forewarned, what this literary pastiche takes as its subject is twofold, the second following from the first: 1 :) The essential bestiality of man in all his affairs, but especially love. All else is an illusory veneer shadowing power, which all of us worship, however we humans try to delude ourselves.  We are all, as Cohen bangs on about time and again \\"future corpses\\" and \\"apes.\\"  This reductionism is taken to its extreme and logical terminus:  All art, painting, music etc is rubbish save that it allows the powerful caveman to drag the all too willing cavewoman into his lair.  2.) Anti-Proustianism.  This is not, as translator David Coward makes clear in his exordium to the book \\"Albert Cohen and Belle Du Seigneur,\\" merely the opinion, voiced time and again, of our male protagonist Solal, but that of Cohen himself.  Why this is so is quite obvious: One can't regard as valid truly numinous experiences transcending all earthy power, as narrator Marcel does, with art, music, cathedrals and, above all, the suffering induced by love, if it is all a sop to what poet Ezra Pound called \\"the twitching of an abdominal nerve\\" or what Cohen via Solal continually portrays herein as \\"wriggling together like fish.\\"  I am utterly baffled and nonplussed by apparently serious reviewers comparing Cohen to Proust, which is exactly what he emphatically is NOT, by Cohen's own disavowal of the greater artist.<br /><br />There are other aspects to the book of course.  The other overarching theme is that all true love is damned to the hell which Solal and Ariane find themselves almost from the start of the famous seduction chapter, rather like Dante's couple in the Inferno - to whom Cohen alludes - damned to the hell of togetherness forever.<br />I could write an entire review about how Cohen's interior monologue chapters are so obviously pale copies from Leopold and Molly Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses or a million other ways in which the book, au fond, fails in the execution.  But the essential problem is the reductionist view of life from which all the other thematic problems spring.<br /><br />But here is the quote which should be emblazoned across the front of the book:<br /><br />\\"Sweet, gay, innocent moments to all appearance, and yet moments in which there gathers the unsuspected possibility of disaster, which makes the amorous life the most precarious of all, that in which the unpredictable rain of sulphur and brimstone falls after the most radiant moments, whereupon, without having the heart or the will to draw a lesson from our misfortune, we set to work at once to rebuild upon the slopes of the crater from which nothing but catastrophe can emerge.\\"<br /><br />Cohen? No, Proust.  But Proust does not despair, for out of the very sufferings engendered by the amorous life arises spiritual awareness and out of spiritual awareness, art.  The problem with writers who would joust with Proust is that they'll find that he's already entered the lists and covered the ground well before them.<br /><br />Translator David Coward ends his exordium with the asseveration: \\"Belle de Seigneur has the epic grandeur of a descent into hell.\\"  Reading it is certainly a descent into a whirligig of pastiches, styles and bilious misanthropy.  But as for \\"epic grandeur\\" - this is, sadly, exactly what the book lacks.<br /><br />It's rather if Lucifer tripped.adly, exactly what the book lacks.    It's rather if Lucifer tripped.
1439153663|4.0|Kathleen Grissom has written a page turning historical novel with her first novel, The Kitchen House. It's a compelling story set in late turn of the 18th Century Virginia. A young girl, Lavinia, sails from Ireland with her parents and brother, and by the time she gets to port her parents have both died and her brother is  taken away from her to be apprenticed out.  She is placed into servitude by the Captain of the ship and taken to his plantation, Tall Oaks, where she is raised by the slaves he owns.  Later she is sent to Williamsburg to be educated and learn white society social graces.  Eventually she comes back to Tall Oaks as mistress of the plantation with disastrous results.    Grissom fully develops most of her characters, and makes us feel empathy for them and their situations.  Although we wonder, as do other characters in the book, how Lavinia can stay so naïve for so long.  But Grissom does a good job of exploring the dichotomy of Lavinia's situation; a white girl raised by black slaves, then becoming their owner.  She also explores the meaning of family and family ties.  There are a lot of children being raised by someone other than their own mother or family in this book.     The only negative thing I can say about the book is it's a melodrama, one tragic thing after the other happens. I guess that's what makes it such a page turner, you want to see what the next big tragedy will be. It's a small criticism, and the book is absolutely worth reading.
1608870081|5.0|I bought this book for the hardcore Potter fan in the family and they absolutely loved it! The book is incredibly intricate with about a million different moving parts, but it manages to work perfectly. There are all kinds of hidden pockets and small pop-ups, so the re-read factor is high. It can seem a bit stiff/delicate at first, but we haven't had any problems with bends or rips, it just keeps on wowing people. If you, like me, haven't checked out a pop-up book in 20 years, you'll be amazed with what this one can do!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I received my Anthology set yesterday and I really like the packaging.  I was expecting a larger book but it came very compact, which is nice if you have a large dvd collection like I have.  The book is really cool because the pages are a nice thick board that has colorful stills from the movies.  I also liked the 'green' packaging.  I know that some reviewers didn't like the disc sleeves but after fumbling with the old fold out set I find the discs to be very easy to access and of course with no plastic it is environmentally correct.    I did sit down and watched Alien.  The picture and sound were incredible.  I was noticing all the little details that I had not noticed before which was like seeing the movie again for the first time.      Love the movies and love the new book.  The packaging is very nicely done.
B004EQAVFU|5.0|I must say right up front that I haven't read the book, though my wife says the movie is not quite as good. That said, I was blown away by this film. The direction (beautiful landscapes, awe-inspiring framing, perfect period setting, etc), the acting (seriously, Carey Mulligan's performance is a revelation), and the story (a subtle bit of science fiction for people that hate science fiction) are all impeccable, especially on Blu Ray. The picture is crystal-clear. This is one for the collection.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I've read other reviews, and mine may never be read, but I wanted to give my 5-stars. Certainly, there's a problem with great books being put to film; that author Jonathan Safran Foer helped in the production and screenplay, I can find no problem inasmuch as the necessary moments are well represented. As directed by Liev Schreiber, with obvious care and compassion, I enjoyed the road-movie narrative at all times. The inclusion of Eugene Hutz created a much needed bit of lightness in the proceedings. Other reviewers thought it was a Borat rip-off, but Borat came 2 years later. Someone even cried racism, but there were equal punches from Americans, Ukranians and Jews alike. No problem there. The fact that Mr. Foer himself aided in writing this film makes me think that Hutz' performance was not a carricature at all. What bothered me was that Foer's character, as portrayed by the usually terrific Elijah Wood, was totally insensitive, like an observer in his own story. Totally lacking in any emotional vibe; he hugged the dog at the end, which was his only show of affection at all. And a great dog performance, too. Boris Leskin is excellent, too, as the faux-blind driver, who has his own catharsis. I think it's Jana Hrabetova who plays the real hero of the film, at the end, so sensitive and endearing. My resulting opinion is that Mr. Schreiber made a quality Indie film about an often ignored situation, based on a big book, and done well. I would consider buying it.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|First, the elephant in the room ... the original film, Let The Right One In, is easily one of the best horror movies of the past decade. For this reason, an American remake was almost entirely unnecessary. That said, everyone involved did a pretty great job with the material. The direction is dazzling, throwing back to 80's America instead of the cold backdrop of Sweden. The brilliant casting of Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee marks a rare intelligent decision by Hollywood. The tension is thick. It doesn't quite reach the highs that the original does, but if you've never seen it, or are really not into foreign films with subtitles, consider this one of the best horror films of 2010. The Blu Ray transfer is impressive, both the video and audio are flawless. Even if you've seen the original a million times, check this one out, you'll enjoy it.
B0055JP7EU|5.0|I've been waiting to see this episode since the day I saw the title. This episode answers some questions and a really big one, but still leaves more questions yet to be answered! I became a fan of River Song ever since she first appeared in the 4th season and left countless questions. Despite learning who River Song is it still leaves a feeling of sadness from her first appearance.  I also love how Rory has developed into a stronger and more confident person. This episode also brings in some new characters that I'm interested to figure out more of their past history. I can't wait till the fall comes and we get to finish this season. I bet many questions shall be answered and more will be left unanswered. You have to love this quote early in from River Song-\\"He'll rise higher than ever before and then fall so much further\\"
1430233834|2.0|I'm returning it after the first chapter.  I looked through the book.  It doesn't teach anything too amazing.    Let me explain why I don't like the code:    In the first chapter you draw the dice for different faces of the dice when it needs to display 1,2,3,4,5 or 6.  EVERY time you draw a circle it is   var dotx;  var doty;  ctx.beginPath();  dotx = dicex + whatever;  doty = dicey + whatever;  ctx.closePath();  ctx.fill();    You end up writing this code at least 15 times.  Instead of making a function or an object to do it like this:  function Circle(){   this.dotx = 0;   this.doty = 0;   this.render = function(){    ctx.beginPath();    ctx.arc(dicex + this.dotx,dicey + this.doty,dotrad,0, Math.PI * 2,true);    ctx.closePath();    ctx.fill();   }  }    Redundant code is just sloppy in my opinion.     The author also says to do   Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;  When this accomplishes the same thing:  Math.ceil(Math.random()*6);    I don't know why they did this.     There are many more minor things.  I would just prefer to read a book by someone who is more familiar with the language.
B0055JP7EU|5.0|I was already enjoying this episode immensely and then....the end!  Wow, what a reveal!  I was blown away.  I was actually crying my eyes out and had to watch the end over and over!  It still makes me cry---not in a bad way!!!  Nope: I was shocked and amazed and so happy.  It was completely and utterly BRILLIANT!  5 Stars!  I only wish the next episode would be coming faster!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Sit down in a comfortable place, close your eyes, and just listen.  You'll be moving in your seat and jamming along, feeling good in no time.  It's American music at its finest.  You will not be disappointed.  I thank God for great musicians who care enough to create music this good - with soul and professionalism.  I just wish more people knew about them, so we could see them in the media more than all these no-talent posers that clog up the media space.  Oh well, I have my CD's.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|I can only say WOW!  No--actually I can say quite a bit more.  This was a fun, roller coaster of a movie.  It was so quiet at times (reminding me a lot of some of M. Night Shyamalan's works) and the next moment I was screaming and giggling at the same time.  Brilliant supporting actors.  The kids were a dream.  Especially the little pyromaniac!  Too funny.  It was also a nostalgic movie, reminding me strongly of \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"Goonies\\".  It was great watching kids actually getting out and having an adventure.  No wonder they had to set it in the past!    Anyway---I loved it.  Can't wait to see it again and I will definitely be buying this one for my personal collection!
6305212112|5.0|It ws the year of \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" when the Academy thought that was the best picture...\\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" was nominated for supporting actresses and screenplay. Both had criminal acts and cannibalism, told in quite different ways. While \\"Lambs\\" concentrated on the darkest motives of humanity, \\"Tomatoes\\" dealt with that and much more. There are few scenes more moving than the train moving slowly through the hobo camp of displaced families in the depression and Idgie and Ruth handing out food to the poor. This is another film that gained its audience through word of mouth, as the studio seemed to think the film had nothing sensational to offer, just the two friendships of four women. This was a film about women, young and old. A Chick Flick. Men would be uncomfortable - probably especially when seeing Kathy Bates' husband sit stolidly in from of the TV night after night, ignoring her pleas for attention. But considering the sweep of this movie - including the ku klux klan, criminal justice, the depression, cancer, parking place etiquette, women's liberation, the warehousing of elderly people, family tragedies and what makes a family anyway - I believe it received a good deal less critical approval than it deserved. That it pleased audiences that did find it enormously with its warmth and humor and stellar performances is known - and you should see it for yourself.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|I watched this movie on opening day and boy did I feel ripped off... I've also read allot of reviews over the months and wanted to try and convey exactly what is really going on with this film to help others make a logical choice weather to buy the ticket and take the ride.<br /><br />Honestly, I really wanted to like it :(<br /><br />People who review the film throw words and phrases around like \\"misguided\\" or \\"misunderstood\\"... I'd agree, things like using Sweet Dreams in the opening sequence was terribly misguided by the director and set's an odd tone right from the word go in my opinion.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be a story about empowerment, which is admirable. The two biggest flaws in it seem to be as follows. The trailer leads you to believe it's going to have allot of sexy girls in short skirts leaping around fighting crazy robots and monsters with swords and machine guns. Which it does have, however this accounts for less then half the film... about 40-50 minutes on the generous side, broken into 4 sequences through out the film.<br /><br />The majority of the film is more like Little Orphan Anne meets Moulin Rouge, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. What is bad however is in order to get a PG-13 rating allot of this portion of the film had scenes of a mature nature cut or trimmed way down. This kills allot of momentum of the film, but most importantly it removes the feeling of danger and pearl we should feel for all the main characters. At first I felt it was because the story is \\"a dream, within' a dream\\", but have since realized it's because it's PG-13. There's a cap on what we will see as an audience which brings the level of engagement way down. Nothing on screen will be as terrible as what we can imagine in the same situation. When a scene comes that leads us to believe something unsavory is about to happen, we automatically know it won't be that bad, due to the rating... something will intervene to keep us safe at PG13.  Together these two elements really hurt the film because we, as an audience quickly realize two things. First, due to it being a dream, the characters are never really in true pearl and secondly that in situations where the characters are in a position to have unthinkable physical harm befall them, on or off screen it's never as terrible because it's a PG-13 dream... honestly, it would have been better if it was exactly the same movie but with an R rating so the viewer isn't preconditioned by the rating to understand how far things will actually go.<br /><br />I was hoping the dvd/blueray would have the additional material put back in to see if the film plays out any better, but if the run time is accurate on this listing that doesn't appear so. I think ultimately, the concept wasn't bad and was even an admirable attempt, the special effects and fight scenes are spectacular and worth a look. I just found myself not caring about any of the characters and just wishing the movie was over about 25 minutes in so I could do something more constructive with my afternoon.because we, as an audience quickly realize two things.

B003E8P9G0|4.0|Riordan has done it again, and I'm very happy he has. This book (and series) has the same premise as the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series, there are gods from ancient cultures who need the help of 'godlings' to protect the world and their way of life. It's different enough that it provides something new to the world and similar enough that if you loved Percy Jackson there is a great chance you'll love this too. There are even moments where they will mention the Greek/Roman gods, but very vaguely and you'll only get the hints if you've read the other book. The concept of the gods having to use human forms is really interesting and the premise of battle magic avatars is pretty much awesome. On a side note I am so thankful that someone finally portrayed Anubis in a positive light, western culture has a nasty habit of making him look evil.Anyway I sincerely look forward to the next in the series.
0307405095|5.0|Yet another awesome book from my Martha!  What can I say?  She has done an excellent job, again!!
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I've come to love Rick Riordan's style of writing thanks to Percy Jackson, and now he has moved on to Jason Grace's story. It has the same flow and style of the first series but a few things are different. There are multiple points of view which is how the chapters are labeled in this book. Also while the storyline has carried over he has added to it in a really creative way, he's incorporated the Roman side of the Greek gods. Overall if you enjoyed the Percy Jackson series then you'll enjoy this as well. I personally can't wait for the second one to come out
B003S3F8SA|5.0|Dive into Nolan's labyrinthine worlds within worlds with only music as your guide. You will get lost - and you will love every second of it. This is an extreme musical trip into the unknowable.<br /><br />To anyone who has not yet seen this epic movie I would strongly recommend to do so. Nevertheless, the soundtrack stands on its own. Zimmer only had the script to go by so his compositions reflect his own take on the characters and events of the movie and are not simply there to complement the pictures.<br /><br />The collections starts off ominously with the short HALF REMEMBERED DREAM, reaches an early peak with THE DREAM IS COLLAPSING, turns playfully threatening with ONE SIMPLE IDEA to end with my favorite, TIME, a majestic closing piece, full of new found hope and open sunbathed vistas.<br /><br />If you think of buying this because you were blown away by the trailer music keep in mind that it is not included. That piece is called [[ASIN:B004I2JUS4 Mind Heist]] and it was actually composed by Zack Hemsey, not Hans Zimmer.<br /><br />This is the music of the worlds within, the sound of our subconscious fears and most secret dreams; the sound of the pulsating thread that connects us with the Universe.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0060919760|2.0|First, I'll give credit where credit is due.  Dyer's Your Erroneous Zones may well have been a groundbreaking work in the mid-70s when it first came out.  I recently read it because a friend I work with has all his clients read the book as a starting place for therapy.  My response: YAWN!  I asked my friend if the book was along the lines of Bruce Lipton's, Caroline Myss's and Candace Pert's work, and he said it was, in some ways, but that he preferes Dyer's book because it helps ensure people understand the basics - and many of the books I mentioned are above what the average client will understand. (Hmm ... I tend to disagree, but that's another point.)    The verdict:  This book helped cure my insomnia!  I could barely read a page or two without falling asleep.  I don't disagree with much of what Dyer says but with how he says it.  In 2011, there are so many people that are saying it better and also incorporating spirituality, physiology, biology, and more.      Even if I try to consider this book's worth from the standpoint of what it offered in the mid-70s, I have to wonder about his absolutes; i.e., you must do A or B, as though there aren't a whole range of options and as though life doesn't exist among a continuum.  (I should note that, before my friend suggests this book to clients, he lists about five caveats; i.e., things about the book that he didn't were accurate.  I asked him why he then uses the book and he says he still feels it's one of the best.  Okay.  But I disagree and, in a fashion Dyer would be proud of, I told him so).  If you ready what Dyer says and take it to the extreme, as he proposes, we would all walk around concerned soley about ourselves without exercising any compassion toward others.  We would never realilze the importance of compromise to healthy, human relationships.      The bottom line:  if you're going to read Dyer's work, read something from much later in his career.  And, consider picking up a Caroline Myss or Christiane Northrup book instead or also - especially if you're female and read from a female perspective (please don't ask me to define that: I think many of you know what I mean - the way a \\"male-dominant brain\\" and \\"female-dominant brain\\" communicate the same principle will vary greatly and the male or female message will sit better depending on your way of thinking).  This isn't a gender thing in the sense that men will think like men and women will think like women.  Some men will think like women, and some women will think like men.  And, most of us will fit somewhere on a continuum and think both \\"male\\" and \\"female.\\"  I know I do, but I also know I think more \\"female.\\"  Okay, I probably really confused this review now.     The long and short of it.  Unless you are really new to the idea that our thoughts impact how we feel, skip this book.  I found it painful to read given it kept putting me to sleep.  So, if you need a cure for insomnia, by all means, get the book.  Otherwise, you can do far better!
0061122416|3.0|The book that made Paulo Coelho a well-known name, and for good reason! I had been putting off reading this book for the reasons of a) I thought it'd be all about new-age quasi-spiritual dribble, b) it is now too \\"mainstream\\" and I vainly didn't want to be perceived as following the crowd, and c) I thought it'd take too long to get through!<br /><br />Oh how wrong I was! I read it in 2 days. You can perhaps only do this if you are as much as a Paulo Coelho fan as I am and know a little already about his frequented themes. But perhaps if you weren't too familiar with his work, you will either find yourself immersed and enjoy the journey, or discard it as \\"non-practical\\". If you think it's too flawed, too impractical, then this is EXACTLY the book you should be reading and the journey you should embark on.<br /><br />It tells the story of a young man on an introspective and literal journey to find a treasure. Every step of the way he learns about life, love, and himself in the people and things he'd never thought could teach him anything about himself: the desert, sheep, camel drivers, etc. What makes this a great book is it's simple text and profound meaning. It is stylistically an adventure story, so definitely worth a read.

0316056863|4.0|\\"Bossypants\\" is an educational book. In it, Tina Fey explains that the key to becoming a TV comedy star, writer and producer is having a strong father figure and lots of theatrical gay friends as a teenager. Perhaps I'm oversimplifying just a tad, but those things are important, Fey insists.    Fey teaches us other things. To create a successful comedy writing staff, she says, \\"mix Harvard Nerds with Chicago improvisers and stir.\\" By the way, she adds, many of the male writers will pee in jars.    Posing for a photo shoot is \\"the FUNNEST!\\", Fey explains.  The \\"wooooooorst\\" is when there's an explosion on your honeymoon cruise and everyone gets quiet as they contemplate going down with the ship. \\"It's scary when a group of people all know instinctively not to joke around.\\"      The \\"best worst thing ever\\"? That would be when Fey pulled an all-nighter at her home with the \\"30 Rock\\" writers. \\"One night I put my daughter to bed, worked with the writers all night, and in the morning when she toddled out, the writers were still there.\\"    \\"Bossypants\\" is not really an autobiography, but more of a selection of essays drawn from Fey's life. It's funny, light, glib, and sarcastic. Fey shows she can find humor in anything, including pap smears and a scary job at an urban YMCA.     A good portion of the book is aimed at women, with a chapter on fashion and beauty, jokes about breast pumps, discussions of the role of women in the workplace, and observations on the difficulties of being a working mom. Since I have a penis, some of these jokes missed with me.  Also, she casually throws out a lot of pop culture references, not all of which I got. (Who's Michelle Duggar?  Never mind, I just looked it up.)    Still, I liked knowing the background - and politics - behind Fey's appearances as Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live. And I liked seeing the messy, sometimes chaotic, way that \\"30 Rock\\" is made.    \\"While we are grateful for the affection '30 Rock' has received from critics and hipsters, we were actually trying to make a hit show,\\" Fey writes. \\"We weren't trying to make a low-rate critical darling that snarled in the face of conventionality. We were trying to make `Home Improvement' and we did it wrong. You know those scientists who were developing a blood-pressure medicine and they accidentally invented Viagra? We were trying to make Viagra And we ended up with blood-pressure medicine.\\"
B0034G4ORM|3.0|After watching this movie in the theater I found no reason to buy this movie in Blu-Ray. Makes no sense to make a HD movie and then shake the  camera the whole time for effect. Hollywood needs to find a better way to stress action than the 1940's effect of shaking the camera. I won't even buy this as a regular DVD for this reason. It is really too bad because the movie had a great premise and great writing. Shows what a bad director can do to a good movie.
B001ADHCV6|2.0|The Eagles have always been one of my favorite bands,lets just get that out of the way. This is the first time they just sound tired and uninspired .Maybe it's the lack of Don Felder, I don't know. Most of the songs come and go with out hooking you. Unlike other Eagle albums , I doubt if this one will be played 10 or 20 years from it's release. Like most I bought it  because ''hey it's a new Eagles album.I played it many times over the last few years,hoping more a few songs would stick out. Sadly it it still seems like a cash in that most involved didn't seem to care about.Could be after writing and singing ,so many great songs they had no more left in them.Maybe this should have been a one disc release or better yet they should have left egos aside called Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon . I think all the Eagles should have have been involved and maybe we would have been left with one last great record....If only
0439023521|5.0|This is one of the best series I've ever read.  I mostly read the classics, much contemporary literature, and the occasional trashy paperback.  I don't always like what's popular--Twilight, for example, makes me cringe. But this book is sure to please just about anyone: it is an engrossing story, with great characterization, but simply told.  Collins is a master storyteller, and the plot is impeccable. I have sent/lent a copy to friends, my mother, and even colleagues.
B000H6H81Q|1.0|I ordered this great looking Wooly Mammoth for my collection. It looks very much like the famous Charles R. Knight painting-in the picture...I can't rate this toy, because I never received it. They sent me the Baby Wooly in error, and didn't feel like messing with it to return it. Shipping would be about as much as just buying the toy I wanted. The baby Wooly is OK, I guess, but, not what I wanted. I may try again for this item, but, through another vendor. Very disappointed.
6303921248|3.0|I was finally able to watch this miniseries the whole way through, after 16 years, only because of my newfound appreciation of Colin Firth (The King's Speech made me a huge fan.)  I have to agree with most of the other reviews that much of this production is wonderful.  Jennifer Ehle is an intelligent, spirited Jane, and Firth brings great depth to the character of Darcy.  I also loved Mr. and Mrs. Bennet.  However, I disagree with those who would describe it as \\"perfect.\\"     My major criticism is the casting of Jane Bennet.  This character is supposed to be ten times lovelier than anyone else in the neighborhood, with a personality that makes you love her.  Instead, we have a plain Jane at best whose personality is bland and insipid.  For years, I found this version of Jane absolutely unbearable.  I started watching the miniseries two or three times, only to return to the 1980 version, with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul.  (More recently I fell in love with the 2005 Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen movie.)    My other criticisms are more minor.  I thought the flashbacks, when Lizzy and Darcy remember important moments together, were very clumsily done.  I found the music to be often annoying.  And finally, I do prefer to learn about Darcy's involvement in Lydia's wedding only when Elizabeth does.  I didn't think the scenes of Darcy skulking around the pits of London added to my understanding of his character, and it was definitely not the tone that Jane Austen used.
030746363X|1.0|This book contains a lot of things that is scientificly proved wrong, a lot of fairytale talking about Ferris and his friends, mix of other peoples ideas. Save time and money dont get your hands on this book. Glad I borrowed it from the library.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Works fine. I prefer the non-neon board. But the goals are far too wide and the puck sinks far too often. It has enough space to bounce multiple times within the goal area. Fix the dimensions of the board and it will be better.

B004ZQRJFO|5.0|This CD is flawless from track 1 to 11. Both Em' and Royce tear it up every verse. When I heard that 50 and Em' were going to do a collaboration CD I thought it would be tight but lyrically Em' would of tore 50 up. With Royce doing a collaboration with Em', it makes for a more lyrical slayer CD because Royce holds his own with Em'. This is an instant classic with some raw beats, lyrics firing at 100% and a CD that is very refreshing to me because there isn't a ton of this out there unless you look for it, but with Em', you will always hear about it whether its mainstream or underground. BUY THIS CD IF YOU LOVE REAL HIP HOP & RAP

B004AHNIGM|3.0|Wow, the marketing of old man Gregg Allman!! This guy is so propped up by legend and by Lana and Rowland over at &quot;HittintheWeb with the ABB&quot;---&quot;the die hard CULT for ABB and Gregg fans&quot;--- to where one might believe that Gregg is STILL some sort of superstar. When the smoke clears perhaps this fanfare will finally be &quot;cured by time&quot;. As Gregg has WRITTEN, yeah as the prophet spoke and wrote: &quot;everything is finally cured by time&quot;, Surely in time people might come to notice that most of this album is pretty lame and average.<br /><br />OK, so what's to like about this cd. The cd cover photo is CLASSIC. Who doesn't love the oak trees, the greenery, the damp road to the plantation, Gregg standing there like a true survior? And Gregg looks like a survivor, an icon of a man dressed in leather pants, jacket and don't forget those spiffy boots. Then there is Gregg's perennial blonde hair---- NEVERMIND that it's nothing but his hairdresser's DYE JOB. Fast forward to the cd booklet, to that really awful picture of Gregg sitting in the chair. God, look at those gross tattoos and all of those wrinkles. Still, he does have a &quot;twenty something&quot; newly harvested and gently used LIVER.<br /><br />Holy Jesus Gregg, so you have a newly harvested LIVER. Too bad somebody had to DIE so Gregg Allman could be yet ANOTHER Rock and Roll Survivor like ex drug addict David Crosby. But I guess that's just the high cost of low living. OK!! Now Greggory Lenoir, so where's that bag of stones you were throwing at Dickey Betts for having an alcohol problem? Oh, but that was different right? Dickey was &quot;Missing the Note&quot; and hurting the tunes. Surely Gregg Allman's addictions never hurt the music. But oh yeah, poor Gregg, it wasn't HEROIN, ALCOHOL or COCAINE  that destroyed your old liver but simply your addiction to that other needle, the TATTOO NEEDLE. Yeah, it's somebody else's fault that your liver was destroyed by Hepatitis C.<br /><br />Here's my review the album:<br /><br />1. Floating Bridge--- my favorite cover song on the cd. Probably the favorite of most people.<br /><br />2. Little By Little---this song is ok. Susan Tedeschi does it a lot better though. Why cover it?<br /><br />3. Devil Got My Woman-- a close contender for my favorite cover on the cd. Not bad blues really.<br /><br />4. I Can't Be Satisfied--- not a bad cover. Surely we've heard worse.<br /><br />5. Blind Man-- here's where the album starts to go South. Not so great. It has the best Gregg &quot;growl&quot; on the cd though.<br /><br />6. Just Another Rider--nice original song. Typical Gregg imagery, his &quot;mastery&quot; of women, his typical condescension of women he has &quot;had&quot;.<br /><br />7. Please Accept My Love--- not so great.<br /><br />8. I Believe I'll Go Back Home--- not too bad. Decent blues cover.<br /><br />9. Tears, Tears, Tears-- I don't really care for it.<br /><br />10. My Love Is Your Love---I don't like it.<br /><br />11. Checking On My Baby---I don't like it.<br /><br />12. Rolling Stone--- can't get into to it really.<br /><br />&quot;Low Country Blues&quot; is an album of blues covers, minus one original Allman/Warren Haynes song. Music is subjective and liking or disliking this cd is a matter of taste. I thought this album was pretty awful the first few times I played it. I don't think it's as bad as I once thought but I really do not enjoy a good portion of the cd. This album might be Gregg's last and his fans know it and they are therefore making the most of these songs. I surely hoped for something different. I can say though without a doubt that I'd rather listen to this cd than to Allman's last cd &quot;Searching For Simplicity&quot;. Hepatitis C and the liver damage associated with the disease saw Gregg literally waste away. It had the good fortune for Gregg though to bring him back to his iconic rock star weight and look. Gregg looks taller now and so much more like the guy we knew thirty years ago. And the weight loss did wonders to bring Gregg's voice back. Gregg also got off of drugs and alcohol. Now the price to pay for drug addiction could mean Gregg's very real death. So Gregg has decided he wants to live a few more years and to make music. I say good for him.<br /><br />I upped my review to two stars and I removed a good bit of the negativity, which I realized was off the charts. My perspective comes as someone who knows people on the Allman Brothers Band website. I don't know the people in person, but I can say that I know how they act online. The fanbase is very liberal politically. Most on the website advocate for the legalization of marijuana. They tell stories of having dropped acid back in the day. The band is famous from days gone by for having created what they call &quot;Electric Tea&quot;, or tea laced with mushrooms. It's a shroom crowd who embraces psychedelic drugs. Is it little wonder how fans on the website find no fault in Gregg Allman needing and getting a donated liver? In short, I have always found many, many people in the fanbase to be very disturbing. Of course they say I am disturbed, oh well, we all have our problems.<br /><br />Gregg can still sing. He certainly sounds better on this record than he does live. I thought my last 2009 or 2010 Gregg Allman and Friends live recordings were pretty lame. I'll just close this by saying, good for you Gregg. I'm glad you made a half decent record late in your career. I will not, however, excuse or forgive you for the lifestyle you have lived for the majority of your life. And to think the ABB dealt with Dickey Betts, a 30 year guitarist, so harshly. So Dickey has a problem with alcohol. It does not seem though that Dickey Betts is in need of a new liver, and Dickey is older than Gregg. And now as a jaded fan I am supposed to want to walk down that &quot;Hep C&quot; redemption road with Gregg and David Crosby and Phil Lesh, and so on. I'll just let someone else carry that Cross for Gregg. I think Gregg most likely got what he deserved. The story the band and Gregg promote is that dirty tattoo needles destroyed Gregg's liver. Well, it certainly wasn't a tattoo needle that destroyed David Crosby's liver, it was extreme drug abuse.<br /><br />These modern day rock and roll &quot;survivors&quot; owe their lives to modern day Frankenstein medicine. I just hope they never lose sight of why they are still alive. Sure, it's easy to invoke God's grace and all, but many these survivors will live on knowing there is another truth to how they ended up with a harvested organ.<br /><br />I think Gregg has always been a great singer, but his personal life has also always overwhelmed me and it makes me fairly sick. I don't think the man is an &quot;Angel&quot; by a long shot. But he does a good job of playing the part of an angel.lcohol.

1439102724|5.0|I've been a fan of Jodi Picoult for several years and think in addition to Sister's Keeper and House Rules, this is one of her best novels. I loved the characters and the unique plot. The book comes with a CD, each song representing consecutive chapters. Definitely one of my favorite recent reads.

B004ZQRJH2|5.0|Bad Meets Evil has been on hiatus for the better part of a decade, but you would never know it by listening to this E.P. Each track, with the exception of \\"Lighters,\\" features complex, blistering, back-and-forth rhymes delivered by two incredibly skilled veterans of the rap game. Eminem is held by many to be the Greatest of All Time (GOAT) to ever rock the mic while Royce da 5'9\\" is never mentioned in debates about who the GOAT is; he is almost never mentioned in anyone's top 5, top 10, or top 25. Nevertheless, he holds his own with Eminem despite the disparity in their skill levels. There is probably no other rapper in the game who could do so, verse for verse, bar for bar, on almost a dozen songs. Few rappers could avoid being \\"murdered on their own ish\\" the way Royce has here.<br /><br />Royce and Em rap circles around one another, finish each other's lines, and pick up where the other left off, sometimes mid-bar. The video equivalent of their dynamic can be seen at the end of \\"Fast Lane\\" music video where they jump in front of one another to be first before the camera. Theirs is a unique chemistry -- a competitive cooperation, or a cooperative competition -- that has produced a lyrical rap fan's dream.<br /><br />This skit-free almost album length work keeps things moving. There is never a dull moment. \\"Lighters\\" does not fit with the E.P.'s overall motif of murders, beat downs, rapes, and literal/literary insanities, but its inclusion prevents it from being a monotone, boring, one note release. The beats are varied: \\"Take From Me\\" reminds me of something that could've been on Lupe Fiasco's [[ASIN:B004IOP3R4 Lasers]], while \\"Loud Noises\\" is eccentric enough to be challenging for the likes of Eminem.<br /><br />The only two shortcomings of this E.P. are its extreme misogyny (it's sad to see such talent misused; Em's rage is most likely due to his hate/love/hate relationship with his ex-wife Kim) and its lack of socio-political commentary. The latter became painfully obvious with the words from the chorus of \\"Above the Law\\": \\"the poor stay poor, the rich get richer...\\" You would think that Detroit's premier MCs would have something to say about the plight of their city, with half of its population unable to read at a high school level and the devastation caused by the auto industry's destruction/export of formerly well-paid union jobs...<br /><br />One of the best things about the E.P. is the fact that Em and Royce came together and did this for one overriding reason: to have fun doing what they do best. It's not a commercially driven release, it was not created with tracks designed to appeal to specific demographics (club song, chick song, etc.), and it was not done to meet contractual obligations.<br /><br />This is a labor of love and anyone who considers themselves a fan of the art owes it to Eminem and Royce to buy themselves a copy.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Though I haven't bought this Dvd yet, I watched it on PBS this past Sunday.  I was overwhelmed!!  The music was electrifying in this version, if you will.  The singers?: they acted out their parts with facial expressions, the way they formed the words, the qivering lips and throats made this so exceptional to me.
B004WJRDN2|5.0|The audio of the McCartney reissue is more than I expected. This was essentially a home recording Paul made in the wake of the Beatles' break up - it just hadn't been announced yet. This remaster has wonderful dynamics compared to the original CD issue, and the 1993 remaster. The drums sound like they're in your room (first snare pop of \\"Every Night\\" floored me), the bass is strong but not exaggerated, the acoustic guitars are crisp (never enjoyed \\"The Lovely Linda\\" as much as this)<br /><br />The bonus audio disc is rather short - but I'm glad it's on a separate disc, as the material is not up to the standards of the released album (as is usually the case with bonus tracks) The track that stood out for me was the in-progress backing tracks for \\"Oo You.\\" The demo version of \\"Suicide\\" is only interesting because you can hear it in the context of the ending of \\"Glasses\\" from the released album. The bonus audio disc is the weakest part of the set, but still of interest to a McCartney fan (which I am.)<br /><br />The DVD starts off with the EPK being shown on McCartney's site, and has several interesting \\"McCartney\\" album-related performances, most notably 2 performances from the 1979 line-up of Wings. Add in 2 more from MTV Unplugged (remember when MTV had music?) and it's a nice touch. The performance of \\"Suicide\\" leaves one wondering why it wasn't used instead of the demo on the bonus audio disc.<br /><br />All I can say about the book is, THIS is what the extra money is for. Good quality, tons of pictures, very nicely done. A \\"coffee table\\" book just like this would easily sell for $30-$40. These issues are for the true fans, not the casual ones, and with that said - if you are fan, you will love this and it is a great value, considering you also get a digital 24 Bit download (and YES the CODES work) via Topspin with an included card. If you are a casual listener, stick with the basic version. As for me, it's all I could have wanted in a deluxe treatment of one of my favorite albums.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I understand this was created during a writer's strike, and it shows; this is as out-of-the-box thinking as I've ever seen, coupled with great overall quality.  A musical?  About super-heroes and villains?  There's not really a way to define this movie, it just caught me almost immediately with its creativity.  Humor somewhat like \\"The Princess Bride\\"--as performed by Doogie Howser and the cast of Firefly?  So yes, I want to write a review, but all I can say is that it has instantly become a favorite, makes for a great cult-classic, and defies categorization.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|The Christmas theme of the famous \\"Christmas Carol\\" story is clearly depicted in the movie. The characters are readily identifiable with their voices and digital images. The movie is clear, crisp and sharp in Blu-ray, but  superb in 3D.
B003L77G6A|5.0|In its fourth season, \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" has really come into its own. The characters this season are fully developed, with each making use of unique, believable personality characteristics. Whereas the earlier seasons were great because of the novelty of the characters, this season is all about interaction. Meet the cast:    Sheldon Cooper is the resident supergenius. \\"One lab accident away from being a supervillain,\\" Sheldon is socially awkward, yet he doesn't recognize it, nor does he particularly care about interaction with those of his own species. Actually, one could make the argument that Sheldon is not of the human species, yet this is where his humor is manifested. If you loved Sheldon in the earlier seasons, you will continue to do so: Sheldon continues along with his neurotic tendencies, his compulsive nature, and his obvious supremacy. Sheldon's interaction with the other characters continues to be the prime amusement, as Sheldon gains a \\"girlfriend\\" in Amy Ferrah-Fowler this season. Amy, a fellow socially awkward individual, is forced to date once a year by her mother; she decides that Sheldon will pretend to be her boyfriend so that her mother will rest her case, however, they soon develop an awkward friendship that is a quasi-relationship. Meanwhile, Amy bonds with the other girl characters, gaining girlfriends for the first time in her life. You get to witness such highlights of her development as her first sleepover.    Leonard, also a genius, is plagued by his recent breakup with Penny, the beautiful girl next door, yet they both clearly have feelings for each other. When Leonard begins to date his friend Raj's sister, however, Penny begins to get jealous, culminating in an unbelievable season finale. Raj continues to battle with his inability to speak to women as well as jealousy about the fact that Howard finally has a girlfriend. The relationship between Howard and Bernadette is taken to a different, new level, and provides a vast amount of laughs as well.    On the whole, definitely pick up this set. This series is not meant to be enjoyed one episode at a time, but in marathon after marathon. It's sure to instantly pick up your spirits and cause laugh after tear-streaked laugh!
B00003CXD5|5.0|John Huston directs his father and Humphrey Bogart in what is easily one of the greatest American films of all time. It's about greed and human nature and the location filming really adds a lot to the look and feel. Between the great characters and captivating story of gold prospecting in Mexico it's hard to resist. It's also great to see Bogart out of the cool Sam Spade character. Just like \\"The African Queen\\" and \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" where Bogart got a chance to act like someone else for a change, \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" offers that too and more...because I think it's a better film than \\"Queen\\" or \\"Mutiny.\\"
0307716511|4.0|People are always surprised to learn about the close relationship between Beatrice Hemming and her younger sister, Tess. After all, the age difference between them is five years --- too far apart to be true friends, right? What outsiders fail to understand, however, is the intensity of a sister relationship that grows only closer after tragedy. For there was a middle child --- a brother, Leo --- who had cystic fibrosis and died when he was still young. His illness and death, and their father's near-simultaneous disappearance from their lives, have left Bee and Tess an island of two survivors.    They're adults now, in their 20s, with an ocean separating them. Beatrice has chosen a designer life in New York City, where she's a graphic designer for corporate clients. Tess also has artistic talent, but of a very different kind. A promising art student, she's selected a bohemian lifestyle in London rather than the glossy trappings Bee favors. Tess lives in a basement flat, wears hand-me-down clothes --- and is expecting a baby whose father is her (married) art school tutor.    When Bee gets a call from her mother that Tess has been missing for several days, she immediately leaves for the UK, bringing her suitable but not-quite-perfect fiancé along for the trip. While they're there, Bee reconnects with her fragile mother even as she neglects all other relationships in favor of investigating Tess's mysterious disappearance. As she uncovers more and more perplexing details, Bee begins to ask herself questions, too: How well did she really know her sister? And how much might she be at fault for what may have happened to her?    \\"I'd do anything to have a second chance, Tess,\\" Bee thinks to herself in a moment of mixed-up grief and guilt. \\"But unlike our storybooks, there's no flying back past the second star to the right and through the open window...I can't sail back through the weeks and in and out of the days returning to my bedroom where my supper is warm and waiting for me and I'm forgiven. There is no new beginning. No second chance. You turned to me and I wasn't there.\\"    Bee's sorrow and guilt compound themselves into a bizarre blend of reactions. She finds herself identifying, sometimes chillingly so, with her younger sister, even as she doggedly insists that the police investigators listen to her version of events, a story they've all but discounted.    Rosamund Lupton's debut novel is a winner, as worth reading for its psychological intensity as it is for its mystery plot, not to mention the genuinely surprising twist near the end. At times, Bee's outpourings of affection toward Tess can seem melodramatic or old-fashioned, but as the reader grows to understand the true stakes of Bee's story, her emotional involvement becomes both more convincing and truly poignant. \\"We are conjoined by hundreds of thousands of memories that silt down into you and stop being memories and become a part of what you are,\\" Bee considers, as she approaches a moment of utter, heartbreaking empathy that will arouse readers' emotions as well.        --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

0425242099|5.0|In the world of the Psy, being anything other than cold and emotionless can get you killed - or worse.  Sienna Lauren's family defected from the PsyNet when she was a teenager, seeking refuge with the powerful SnowDancer pack.  In Sienna's case, life free of the Silence Protocol is both a precious gift and an incredible threat.  For Sienna is an X-Psy, a rare designation whose powers leave her a ticking time bomb.  Sienna can't ever give into her powers, not when doing so would not only kill her, but everyone around her.  At nineteen, Sienna is far older than her years.  Nothing can shatter her control.  Nothing except Hawke.<br /><br />At fifteen, wolf changeling Hawke became alpha of a broken pack.  His history is steeped in bloodshed, pain, and loss, but from that foundation he worked to make SnowDancer into one of the most powerful packs in the world.  Though he loves his pack, Hawke is, in many ways, a lone wolf.  Wolves only mate once and Hawke lost the girl who would be his mate during childhood.  Yet something about the beautiful, brilliant Sienna calls to Hawke in a way he cannot push aside.  She knocks him off balance, making him want things he knows he cannot - should not - have.  So he puts distance between them, burying his desire for Sienna.<br /><br />Only Sienna will no longer be ignored.  She wants all or nothing and Hawke knows that if he turns her away, he'll lose her forever.  One kiss is all it takes for their passion to blaze out of control.  But before Hawke and Sienna have a chance to explore what's growing between them, an enemy launches a vicious attack that endangers everything the lovers hold dear.  Soon they are in for the fight of their lives as a war unlike anyone has ever seen threatens to consume them all.<br /><br />Listen up, Psy-Changleing fans: the book you've all been dying for is more than worth the wait!  Kiss of Snow is a fast-moving, heart-pounding, sexy-as-hell thrill ride that will have you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.<br /><br />Sienna and Hawke have been dancing around each other almost from the beginning of the series, so I had high expectations coming into their story.  The sexual tension in Kiss of Snow is to-die-for, and when Hawke and Sienna get together the pages of the book burn bright and hot.  Yet, despite the couple's sensual appeal, the lighthearted moments between them are equally engaging.  I don't want to spoil the fun, but I will say that I wouldn't mind \\"playing\\" with Hawke.  Individually, Hawke and Sienna are characters you'll fall in love with, even if you haven't already.  Both have had to take on the mantles of control, responsibility, and maturity at a very young age.  It has shaped them and it also shapes their relationship.  Hawke has a loving, fiercely protective nature that makes you swoon, even while you shake your head, knowing those same qualities will cause him to make mistakes with Sienna.  Sienna, in turn, has incredible strength paired with a huge heart and I loved her for it.  The two are made for each other, made to lead the pack, and made to win readers' hearts.<br /><br />In many ways, Kiss of Snow is not just Hawke and Sienna's story, but the story of the Lauren family.  Throughout the series, you've seen the love that bonds Sienna, her brother, cousin, and uncles together, but in Kiss of Snow you truly see them as a group.  Their history is central to the story, as are their relationships with the changelings they've fallen in love with.  Readers who loved Caressed by Ice will be thrilled to see more of Judd Lauren and his mate, Brenna.  Kiss of Snow also features a romance subplot for Walker Lauren and SnowDancer healer Lara.  I sighed and, I must admit, went a bit gooey over Walker and Lara's story, for it was beautiful.<br /><br />Nalini Singh's talent for mixing romance with world-building continues to be unmatched.  She takes this ability to new heights in Kiss of Snow as the war amongst the Psy spills over to that of thechangelings and humans.  There's so much action, intrigue, and danger in Kiss of Snow that I'd love to talk about.  However, I feel like giving anything away would ruin the excitement of the book, so I'll simply say that Ms. Singh seamlessly weaves so much into the story that I was amazed.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is the thirteenth story (tenth full-length book) in the Psy-Changeling series.  Ms. Singh provides enough information for new readers to follow along, but I wouldn't recommend it.  For me, the power of the story stemmed from my connection to all the characters involved and the world that I have come to love over the course of the series.  I encourage readers new to Ms. Singh's work to read at least the nine previous full-length books before reading Kiss of Snow.  Slave to Sensation, Visions of Heat, Caressed by Ice, Mine to Possess, Hostage to Pleasure, Branded by Fire, Blaze of Memory, Bonds of Justice, and Play of Passion are all such incredible reads that you won't regret holding off just a bit before reading Kiss of Snow.<br /><br />For those who've already read and loved the previous Psy-Changeling books, you're in for a real treat.  Almost all the previous protagonists appear in Kiss of Snow, in addition to secondary characters that you know and love...and will come to love more.  I mentioned before the importance of the Lauren family in this book, but don't think that Kiss of Snow is all about the SnowDancer pack and their mates.

I loved Kiss of Snow, utterly and completely, and I Joyfully Recommend it!<br /><br />Shayna<br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedaction, intrigue, and danger in Kiss of Snow that I'd love to talk about.  However, I feel like giving anything away would ruin the excitement of the book, so I'll simply say that Ms. Singh seamlessly weaves so much into the story that I was amazed.     Kiss of Snow is the thirteenth story (tenth full-length book) in the Psy-Changeling series.  Ms. Singh provides enough information for new readers to follow along, but I wouldn't recommend it.  For me, the power of the story stemmed from my connection to all the characters involved and the world that I have come to love over the course of the series.  I encourage readers new to Ms. Singh's work to read at least the nine previous full-length books before reading Kiss of Snow.  Slave to Sensation, Visions of Heat, Caressed by Ice, Mine to Possess, Hostage to Pleasure, Branded by Fire, Blaze of Memory, Bonds of Justice, and Play of Passion are all such incredible reads that you won't regret holding off just a bit before reading Kiss of Snow.     For those who've already read and loved the previous Psy-Changeling books, you're in for a real treat.  Almost all the previous protagonists appear in Kiss of Snow, in addition to secondary characters that you know and love...and will come to love more.  I mentioned before the importance of the Lauren family in this book, but don't think that Kiss of Snow is all about the SnowDancer pack and their mates.  The DarkRiver leopards are a big part of the book, and not just because of the increasingly close alliance between the two packs.  Kiss of Snow features a subplot that continues the story of everyone's favorite leopard alpha and E-Psy, Lucas and Sascha (of Slave to Sensation), as they start the next chapter of their lives.     Kiss of Snow is everything I hoped it would be and more, making it easy to enthusiastically recommend.  There's laughter and tears, hope and fear, love and loss.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|After 2 hours of watching a really slow movie, it left you with no hope.  Yes there is a hereafter, it's could Heaven or Hell.  Hopefully you go to church or pick up a Bible and make sure you know beyond a shadow of a doubt where you are going.  It's simple, God sacrificed his only Son, Jesus, so that we may have eternal life in Heaven, knowing no pain, no tears, eternal joy and peace beyond comprehension.  No need to fear death if you know you are going to Heaven.  Many people have died and come back telling the same stories, of both Heaven and Hell.  If you are searching for answers, search for how to find Jesus.  Don't wait until it is too late.

0061992860|5.0|First off, the book is not the dimensions shows - it's 3\\"x4.5\\" so it fits in a shirt pocket or in your cargo pants pocket.  Second, it's printed in 4- or 6-point font, so you either need excellent eyesight, or a magnifying glass to read it.<br /><br />With that being said, and magnifying glass in-hand, the book violates all rules of grammar and punctuation to deliver a concise and heavy-hitting book chocked full of good information.  Virtually no sentence in the book is fluff (unlike this review).  It covers pretty much every condition and every climate with good thumbrules to live by.  And just in case you need a refresher when you get caught in the doomsday zombie apocalypse, having the small book handy will help you review what you may need to know.<br /><br />The food section is excellent and covers how to make a large variety of traps.  Once you read how to make sausage, you'll never look at any tube meat the same way again :)<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone serious about survival.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|The acting in the movie was fine, but the story is pure crap.  Someone in the movie industry got behind this film and pushed it big time to create all the buzz and hype.  The lead character is schizophrenic, which could have lend itself to an interesting story, if the screenwriter and director had done something with it that was worth telling.  Instead, they thought picking at your finger nails and scratching at your back shoulder blades off and on for two hours was intriguing.  I did not find this movie engaging at all.  I was never drawn into the movie, and wanting to know more about the character.  The story was laborious:  I found myself just looking at my watch wondering, \\"When is this going to end.\\"  And talk about endings: what a joke.  I have not found one person that I asked, who saw the movie, who said they liked it.  This is not about \\"ones\\" appreciation of the arts, artistic expression or lack thereof.   This is about having something to say, something worthwhile to tell if you're going to make a movie.  This movie reminds me of the \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\": too many people are afraid to come out, and state the obvious...the movie stinks!    If you like dance, (and even if you don't) and want to see a great movie (based on a true story) with a great story line, and one that makes you care about the characters and what happens to them...see \\"Mao's Last Dancer\\"(also made in 2010).  You won't be sorry.  There is no comparison between the two movies.

B002ZG99CC|4.0|The original Karate Kid was a huge hit back in 1985, and 25 years later, the classic story has a modernized twist as producer Will Smith puts his son Jaden in the spotlight. Trying to remake a film that was original and hip for its' day and age, the crew must have had its' work cut out for them. But what resulted was an action-packed and enjoyable film that will have families stand up and cheering.    12-year old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) finds his life turned upside down when his mother (Taraji P. Henson) gets a new job and they move from Detroit, Michigan, U.S. to Beijing, China. When they arrive in China, what Dre finds is chinese-translated Spongebob, old people slaying at ping pong, and a lot of people not understanding a word he says. After making friends with Henry and Mei Ling, Dre becomes a target for the top kung-fu players, as they slaughter him after Dre tries to help Mei Ling. Meanwhile, Dre meets Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a maintenance man who is one of a few people in the town that speaks very good English. After trying to pull a prank on his enemies, Dre finds himself in even more trouble, but Han comes to his rescue and try and confront the bullies' kung-fu teacher. With a motto of \\"No mercy! No pain! No weakness!\\", the teacher sides with his students' story and challenges Han to fight. Han accepts the challenge by proposing Dre to fight in the kung fu tournament, but the teacher threatened to hurt both of them physically if Dre didn't show up. Han decides to teach Dre kung-fu, leading him on a journey to try and strengthen him, starting with just a simple \\"pick up your jacket\\" and working all the way to doing splits on an apartment railing and anticipating a move from a punching glove behind a curtain. Through several days of training, Dre learns to overcome hardships to find his strengths. And those strengths helped lead him to victory after victory, including beating the leader of the bullies Cheng, in the championship of the Open Kung Fu Tournament.Strong morals of friendship, courage, determination, and not letting your past get you down are strongly and impressively shown. The action is great, though its' also quite violent at times, and it might just be enough for kids under the age of 6 to have a parents' hand over their eyes. One problem I had was that the film was a bit too long (2 hours and 20 minutes), although the scenes are great in their own right. But, The Karate Kid remake is definitely something more than just a kung fu movie, its' a great film that has drama, suspense, and a bit of romance, all mixed into one huge package.

B00006DEFA|1.0|I always loved Amadeus and watched my VHS all the time.  I accidentally ordered this director's cut, which I avoid religiously because I've never liked director's cut movies.  This one is arguably the WORST I've seen.  Even though Salieri is bad and is responsible for the death of Amadeus in the theatrical version, in this version he is made truly evil.  That's only one thing I hated about it... I can't even list all the things I hated.  There's  even nudity, which just does not fit with the theme of this incredible movie.  Buy the theatrical version- it's SO much better than this one, and if you have not seen the theatrical version and hate this movie, then buy or rent that one.  You won't be disappointed!

0545140323|5.0|First of all, I think every high school girl should read this book. Seriously, it needs to be on some required reading lists because it has amazing messages and is something they can almost all relate to in some way.    I loved the style of the writing in the book. It was fun, thoughtful, and felt very genuine. I remember being in high school and these girls (and guys) talked like my friends and I did. I loved how, even though guys being jerks started The Lonely Hearts Club, it turned into being there for your friends and supporting them in whatever it is that they want to do. How much time did we all waste those years worrying about boys that treated us badly? How many of us were ditched by a best friend for a guy, just like Penny was? Too much time was spent, and it happened to too many of us.    If there had been a Lonely Hearts Club at my school, I would have joined...which is ironic because most of my friends were guys. But that was the great thing about this book, they didn't have to stop being friends with guys or anything like that, they just had to make time for each other, and themselves, also. It was about realizing that you don't need a boyfriend and that you are your own person. Even though I am married now, it still resonated with me and reminded me to keep time for my girlfriends and myself.    I wish I knew more high school girls because I would give them this book to read. If you know any, go get it for them and see what they have to say about it. It is a great story, a fun and quick read, and all of the Beatles references are a lot of fun!
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Out of this whole CD, the only song that I kinda didn't like is I'm On Everything. The chorus was a bit annoying to me, but I loved the verses though. My FAV song on this CD is actually the intro (Welcome to Hell). I liked pretty much every song on this. I'm AUTOMATICALLY gonna pick up anything that has to do with Eminem, but Royce did good on this CD too. I'm VERY happy with my purchase. This CD is flawless (besides I'm On Everything). Definitely recommend this!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I enjoyed the tenth anniversary as much as the next person.  But it doesn't quite measure up to the 25th anniversary.  The Les Miserables 10th anniversary version was better vocally, but only slightly.  And I really didn't care for the person who played Elnjoras in the 10th anniversary.  I thought the 25th anniversary Elnjoras was INCREDIBLE.  Alfie Boe sounds great, but does sound just a tiny bit weak at times.  As far as Nick Jonas as Marius, I can't stand the Jonas Brothers.  But I really didn't think he did that bad.  I mean, he's by no means the best of the cast, and compared with the others he does sound a tad weak.  But when he has his solos, such as Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, I thought he was pretty good.  The main thing I had with him was that you could tell he was straining his voice.  I will say that I thought Nick did a better job as Marius than the guy from the 10th anniversary did Elnjoras.    The set and the lighting in the 25th anniversary edition is superb.  The set barely changes, but it serves every purpose for every scene.  it is incredible.  The lighting is AMAZING.  I LOVED the big drammatic spotlights soaring everywhee during the big numbers such as One Day more.  And the flashing red and whiter lights in all the different directions during the battle scene was indescribible.      One final thing I need to comment on is the end.  In case you haven't heard, after the curtain call, the original cast comes out.  There is a quartet between four Valjean actors who sing Bring Him Home.  Then, the original and 25th anniversary casts together perform One Day more.  These two things alone are worth the price of the DVD.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I've been talking this season up to everyone I know who shows even the slightest bit of interest. The season starts off great with the introduction of the Cousins and ends with a bang. The acting is second to none, the characters are so realistic it's easy to think of them as real people. The gritty realism of meth production is balanced with a dark sense of humor(Bob Odenkirk has never been better than as sleazy lawyer Saul Goodman) and action scenes that rival the best you've seen in any movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Season 3 of Breaking Bad. The first season was good, but cut short by the writers' strike. The second season was great in its own right- but this is a whole new level, taking its characters places you never would have imagined. Key episodes: No Mas, One Minute, Half Measures, Full Measure.
B001POX73C|5.0|What girl DOESN'T enjoy reading about rich, privileged women's lives?    I'm not being sarcastic, I'm totally serious.    Cotillion is a sweeping, fantastic, utterly beautiful tale that between its pages takes the normal girl away from her everyday life in the city and transports her to a different time, a time that may not have even really existed in reality (but you WISH it did).    You will find yourself saying \\"I wish I had this kind of romance...\\"    Long book, yes.    I devoured it in less than a week, my appetite is insatiable for this kind of mind food...

B000YAA68C|4.0|Usually I can't stand movies of this sort (\\"The Notebook\\", \\"A Walk in the Clouds\\", etc.), but I must say I was pleasantly surprised after watching this film.    A friend of mine brought it to my home one evening for a girl-talk + manicure session, and an inner part of me groaned...    \\"Oh no -- here comes cheesiness...\\"    I felt guilty for looking down on this movie before even watching it, because after thoroughly enjoying it I realized how wrong a person can be when he or she jumps to naive conclusions.    Is this story cheesy? In many ways, yes. Movies of this sort usually are.    BUT -- the reason why this movie overcomes its groan factor is because Hillary Swank and Gerard Butler are so believable. I didn't think they'd have much chemistry, but they make the story work.    I won't ruin the movie for you, but it's a cute story that leaves one with pangs of longing for something beautifully similar to happen to herself.    I hate this kind of movie. And yet I love this movie. I need therapy.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is Plants vs Zombies. The fun is here, the gameplay is refined and translated to the touch interface without any issues. But PopCap decided for whatever reason to cut the content from this version and therefore, I can not recommend this game to the experienced PVZ players. There are no giga-Gargantuars, no tenth slot for plants, no puzzles, no challenge modes, no tree of Wisdom, no plant garden and the list goes on. When you basically have only campaign mode and quick play (from the same campaign mode), the fun stops once you finish all achievements as there is absolutely nothing to do. Newbies would still love this game but it could be so much more.<br />On the technical note, the graphics are not optimized for tablets (very low-res) but gameplay is pretty fluid in most situations. I have it on CM7 Nook Color and it loads and plays fine most of the time.
B003HYNB34|5.0|This is a great introduction to the new Doctor played by Matt Smith! Smith plays the Doctor quite differently from David Tennant. He plays him more eccentric than Tennant did. I think of the new Doctor as the strange professor. When he gets excited you see him act bizzare in a lovable manner. Smith doesn't look as attractive as Tennant but his acting abilities make up for his lack of good looks.    Karren Gillan who plays the new assistant is a great actor too. The main role for Dr Who's assistant is draw the audience into the world of Dr Who and she's done a terrific job. She looks ordinary, acts like any ordinary person, and is curious about the world of Dr Who. Gillan, as the character Amy Pond, really sells herself as the link that the audience can relate to.     The style of this season is quite different from previous seasons. I think it may be because the writer and producer Russell T Davies left the show and Steven Moffat took over.  The style of this season is more Hollywood Goth style. You can really see that most of the scenes are visually dark and the overall feel seems like a dark fantasy. This is very different from how Davies done it.    Without question, you'll love this first episode! There's quite a bit of subtle humor throughout this episode. There's a flashback sequence that looks fantastic when the doctor tries to remember what he saw.
B003L77GG0|5.0|For the last ten years we watched Clark Kent, becoming boy to a world's legend.  In the show, we made a promise that their would be no flight and no tights.  For the last season, Clark Kent is ready to wear the tights and fly.  He's been through a lot of obstacles that will help him become the greatest superhero for a long time and that will make him a legend.  We watched Clark Kent develop the seven major powers for ten years, the strenghth, the speed, the x-ray, the heat, super-hearing, leaping, Super-breath and flight.  Seeing the finale where Clark Kent wearing the superman suit and flying made it look like he was ready to fulfil his destiny.  We knew he was ready, but Clark Kent himself knew when he was ready to take on the mantle.  He was ready for it to fulfil destiny and wear the superman suit.  Trust me this is how a boy becomes superman.

1416955070|4.0|Clary Fray likes to frequent an all ages club, Pandemonium, with her friend (who emphatically does not) named Simon. On a night like any other, Clary witnesses three teens gang up on a fourth in a storage room. She tries to save the bullied boy, but he is killed and then disappears. Clary is understandably shocked. The boy is a demon and the other three are Shadowhunters, educated and trained to kill demons from a young age using magical weapons and runes. Shortly after this event, Clary's mother, Jocelyn, is kidnapped by a rouge Shadowhunter, Valentine. He seems to think that Jocelyn can lead him to the Mortal cup, a powerful artifact that can create more Shadowhunters, so he can wage war against all demons and half-demons to keep the human race pure. The goal is to make all humans Shadowhunters, but only about 20% of all of them would survive the change. Clary, along with Jace, Alec, and Isabelle, must find the cup before Valentine does and then rescue her mother. Can they succeed before Valentine finds the cup?      I have heard lots of good things about the Mortal Instruments series, so I just had to read what all the fuss is about. City of Bones didn't quite live up to it, but I definitely wasn't disappointed. I really liked the characters. Clary is plucky and brave despite being largely defenseless compared to the trained and prepared Shadowhunters. Not only that, but she's also pretty clever and quick to get used to the strange lives that Shadowhunters live. Of course she makes some mistakes and acts kind of annoying sometimes, mostly when acting rashly and not thinking of others. But that's to be expected with any character. I know there are a lot of Jace fangirls and Jace haters. I'm somewhere in the middle. At first I thought Jace was pretty horrible, but as the book went on, he revealed more and more of the person underneath that hardened outer shell. I felt sympathetic toward shim, but I was still annoyed by some of his over the top bad boy behavior. With what I had heard before, I was expecting Patch (from Hush, Hush) levels of bad behavior. I'm glad that he was far from that and actually likeable instead of just being a complete tool.    The story is pretty predictable and basic for the genre. The characters seem to be especially thick headed in figuring out the mysteries that are pretty obvious much earlier. A lot of the book was dedicated to explaining their world to Clary and by extension the reader: the rules, the runes, the demons, the half demons, etc. It's a little tedious to get through, but admittedly necessary to understanding the story. Hopefully the second book won't have so much of this since the reader would be more familiar with the world and characters.    I enjoyed all the adventure and secrets that City of Bones had to offer. It's like a cross between Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The action was exciting and kept me on the edge of my seat. The twist at the end is a little unexpected. I suspected it earlier, but dismissed it as being to weird for a teen book. I would recommend this book to fans of urban fantasy and similar teen books.

I am a veteran and I know that I will never be able to pay back the debt that me, my family and this country owes Luttrell and his fellow SEALs.  However, Marcus is not a writer.  I don't blame him; he's a skilled medic and special operations combat vet.  I do think that the co-writer, Patrick Robinson did a poor job of making Luttrell's story the best it could be.  If you want a good read about the SEALs, you will find here, but you have to get past the bad writing.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|Maiden's music from the last 12 years has been unfairly overlooked. They sell out whenever they play but when they have new albums they have only lukewarm sales (In the U.S anyway).

B004VUP8WK|5.0|Death Metal fans are so infantile and narrow minded, it absolutely kills me.  It's beyond retardation.    Whenever a band tries something different, or make some type of artistic statement that goes beyond the stereotype of what \\"death metal\\" is supposed to sound like - the core audience gets upset .    This is a terrific Morbid ANgel album, and not really much different from their prior releases.  The only difference is, maybe two or three of the tracks aren't run of the mill death metal with blast beats...    I played the CD twice and only tracks two, 10 and 11 are signficantly different from anything else they've put out in the past.    In fact, you could make the argument that this might be their BEST album and most varied.    Frr all of you Death Metal \\"purists\\" who gave this album a bad review, go back to your Cannibal Corpse and Deicide, and other bands resting on past laurels and dont' have the talent or guts to try something new.  Let true music fans appreciate something of real artistic value that will stand the test of time.
1932100660|5.0|Highly recommend to anyone concerned about their health but totally confused by all the Nutrition and diet information out there.  While reading will require some intensive use of the brain muscle, it is a fascinating book.  The discussion of the food industry, the medical profession, and science in general will change the way you think about  health \\"care\\" and empower you to take care of yourself.      I am happily pursuing a meat free/dairy free diet after being a lifelong dairy/meat lover.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|I watched this movie twice in theaters, despite its bad reviews.  I have to say I'm a bit puzzled as to what critics were expecting when they saw this.  Saving Private Ryan?  Black Hawk Down?  I'm sorry, the movie is just not that deep.  Does it make the movie bad?  Not even remotely.    It's a little cliche, a little overacted, and contains a little too much bravado.  Last I checked, these are all on the checklist for being a Marine.  It's a fun, thrilling ride, full of action, and it's just plain entertaining.    Not into that sort of thing?  Prefer to stick to your thought-provoking Oscar nominees?  That's fine, keep walking.  If you want an exciting bit of entertainment, you can do much, MUCH worse than this movie.

Don't miss this enlightening movie.
B0042SSO1I|5.0|I found the first 2 seasons on netflix and loved watching them. I was lucky to have found such an entrancing arthur series. I have always been a fan of Boorman's Excalibur and have been disappointed with most shows when held up to the Boorman standard. I did find this series exceeded all my expectations and actually was better than Excalibur in almost all aspects. The only thing that gives Excalibur an \\"edge\\" is it is a single movie and this Merlin series is more like an ongoing daytime drama. I could see all the aspects of Merlin made into a three movie trilogy and blow away Lord of the Rings, but one can only hope. All SEASONS of MERLIN are available on ITUNES in the USA. You can rent or buy them there. If you plan to rent I suggest watching the first two seasons on netflix. Please give me a positive rating if this helped you, thanks :D    [...]
B00005K9LM|5.0|Defenders of the Faith has always been one of my personal favorite albums from Judas Priest. Released hot off the heels of their 2nd smash hit album, Screaming For Vengeance, Priest went a different direction, this time avoiding more of the mainstream-ish sound that had been present on there last 3 albums, and came with a very dark and sinister atmosphere for Defenders. The album starts off with the fast Freewheel Burning, probably the fastest song Priest had recorded thus far. A great song, amazing Rob Halford vocals. Jawbreaker is another great song, with some tastful licks from KK & Glenn. Rock Hard, Ride Free is one of the most underrated Priest songs, as it is a melodic metal masterpiece. The solo from Glenn is absolutely elegant. The Sentinel continues the the great songs, an amazing melodic break in between. Love Bites is a sinister dark song about vampires, featuring some great bass work from Ian and great guitar effects from Glenn & KK. Eat Me Alive has some notorious lyrics, hard to believe no one realized it back then but this a great fast song, with great guitar work from Glenn once again. Some Heads Are Gonna roll is a cover, another great song and probably the most-commercial sounding song on here. Night Comes Down is a great Priest-style ballad, not sappy but very emotional and heavy. As the title intends, it has a dark atmosphere to it. Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith is a rather strange end to this amazing album, more or less made for the concert chants(Take on the World, United), but none the less, they're both sort and segue into each other, not too bad and pretty fun to listen to. The bonus tracks on this edition are ok, like with most other of the Priest remasters, but several things with THIS remaster hinder me from accepting it. For one, Glenn & KK's guitar channels have been reversed on this remaster, so instead of hearing the first riff on Freewheel Burning on the right speaker, you'll hear it in the left speaker. For someone who's listened to this album for a long time it does render a problem, but it's not a real big issue. What is though, is hearing pops and cracks, not the vinyl kind either, in a new remaster. None of the other Priest remasters have this, I have them all. It's really a shame that it happened to this album in particular. Others have mentioned the loudness problem with these remasters, I don't think that's really a problem, except for a few minor occasions. As for this album, I've stuck with my original CBS version from 1990, it seriously lacks sound quality but at least it isn't flawed. I also have the original version of Turbo, as with the new remastered version, it sounds somewhat different, the dynamics seemed slightly changed, and on Out in the Cold, after the first riffs, there's an obvious glitch/skip present on all remastered versions of the song(The remastered Turbo album and The essential Judas Priest). Just be aware of remasters, try to A/B them with you're original copy and make sure they are authentic and improved like they should be. Other than that, great album from Judas Priest.d to this album for a long time it does render a problem, but it's not a real big issue.

0439023513|3.0|Having read all 3 books very recently, i literally just finished mockingjay, i cant help feeling that somewhere down the line Collins became as lost as her main character was.  The first book had a great plot, decent prose and (i thought) fantastic character development,  especially (and obviously) with Peeta and Katniss.  The second book successfully piggy backed on this theme and though possibly a little predictable (and perhaps a little too familiar) gave us a cliffhanger that made me want to rush out and buy mockingjay the second i finished catching fire.  But then we come to this.  A book that had a lot of promise and potential but got lost in the creation process.  Collin's certainly sacrificed much of her story (especially the rushed ending even though it was the one i wanted)in order to convey her overall all messages of the horrors of war and the irreversible issues that it can cause for everyone involved.  This was very poignant and had it been done with moderation probably more effective.  Given her background with a vietnam vet for a father i can completely sympathize with her desire to incorporate this theme into her story.  However, as we all know, \\"fire is catching\\".   Completely \\"hijjacking\\" her beloved characters and turning this into a vehicle for her anti war messages was a questionable choice at best, yet there are actually parts where she spends paragraphs spelling it out to everyone.  And as a result these previously round characters fall flat and become these damaged icons that are promptly whisked away from the audience, leaving us to worry more about their well being instead of the saturating overtones of the book.  Important plot pieces are brief yet cause our heroine to grieve for pages and there's never much attempt to assuage her fall outs throughout or even at the end of the book.  I cant help but feel that a movie deal being in the works greatly affecting the design of this book.  From the tone and messages right down to the way it waswritten.  Such as parts where collin's in obviously trying to paint the picture as it will look in the movie.  I guess what im trying to say is that if you enjoyed the first two books then you should appreciate this book, however, i think had that if Collins really cared about her characters, let alone her audience then she would have taken more time with this one and done justice to the girl who was on fire and everyone she/we loved.  what say you, collin's?  Once more, with feeling?

B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Very good folk/rock CD.  Similar to Avett Bros.  There is one song that has the F-bomb in the chorus though - but it's a good song too.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|An explosively moving and everlasting piece of musical magic that manages to rock, as well as enlighten, the listener. Murphy is, of course, the uniquely seasoned pro who deftly pulls from original streams of philosophy, religion, art, and pure passion for life to create the most delectable audible tableau. He creates his own elegant mythology.<br /><br />We are transfixed and hypnotized into tantalizing wonderment at the powerful and vibrant vistas that sumptuously emerge. Neural pathways will expand. As he gets hold of your brain, you'll tap your feet as you are happily played like some earthling puppet being introduced to paradisiacal realms from which you shall never want to return.<br /><br />His dynamic collections of lyrics blending with perfect musical arrangements - and solid musicianship - are like strands of rare cognitive gems or pearls. Your ears are in for a deeply cosmic treat. We have anxiously awaited this profound offering and are being rewarded generously.<br /><br />Open up your soul to a truly momentous and enduring experience. You are about to be introduced, and transported, to the ninth level of consciousness in Peter Murphy's amazing world. Enjoy the infinite ride!
B004V6U7F2|4.0|Okay, when I first listened to the album I thought it was alright compared to their previous albums. But giving it a second and third listen I definitely like it. Some of the songs are slower than usual and that's one reason my sister didn't take well to the album (she introduced me to Mana over 10 years ago) but not everything can be so upbeat all the time. Overall I like the album, it's not their greatest work but it's still good and I absolutely am looking forward to their concert next month.
B004UHF51S|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best Michael Franks album since 1983's \\"Passionfruit.\\"  I am a twenty-something music enthusiast and over the years I've collected all of Michael's !SEVENTEEN! proper releases, most on vinyl, which is undoubtedly the best way to experience his music.  By this point in his career, Michael should really be considered a legend in the jazz pop world.  Alas, he is highly underrated.  This is a shame because he is the \\"real deal.\\"  He continues to effortlessly blend jazz, pop, and world music with stunningly brilliant lyrics to great effect.      Michael is at his best when his complex melodic ideas are designed to slowly seep into your sub-conscious in such a way that one line like, \\"The lady wants to know...\\" triggers immediate auditory recall of that song's lyrics and melody.  For me, the albums that do this best are [[ASIN:B000002KCF Art of Tea]], [[ASIN:B000002KGR Sleeping Gypsy]], [[ASIN:B000002KII Burchfield Nines]], [[ASIN:B000002KK1 Tiger in the Rain]], [[ASIN:B000002KL6 One Bad Habit]], and [[ASIN:B000002KZL Passionfruit]].  I intentionally organized those albums chronologically and omitted 1982's \\"Objects of Desire\\" which never quite clicked with me.     Let me be clear -- Michael Franks has never released a \\"bad\\" album.  I just happen to prefer certain production and songwriting techniques that are present on his timeless '70s and early '80s albums.  To be more specific, I feel that the '80s had a slightly adverse impact on some of Michael's output.  This is particularly true with the albums \\"Skin Dive\\" and \\"Camera Never Lies.\\"  In anticipation of this album, I read almost all of the Amazon.com reviews of Michael's back catalog, and I seem to be in the minority here.  But to me, \\"Skin Dive\\" and \\"Camera Never Lies\\" sound extremely dated because of the heavy use of compression, drum machines, and special effects.  Yes, these albums include some brilliant compositions, but the brilliance is overshadowed by the '80s production.  I have some reservations about the '90s albums for similar reasons, but mostly because the compositions seem to wander and the use of saxophone is too liberal for my aesthetic.    But I digress.  \\"Time Together\\" is a modern masterpiece.  I have listened to it at least twelve times and the songs are already ingrained in my musical memory.  It is impossible to NOT memorize the clever/cute/insightful lyrics of \\"Mice\\" or the catchy chorus to \\"Now That The Summer's Here.\\"  Add some of Joe Sample's Fender Rhodes and \\"I'd Rather Be Happy Than Right\\" could have easily been included on \\"The Art of Tea.\\"  And the brilliance doesn't end there.  \\"Charlie Chan in Egypt\\" and \\"My Heart Said Wow\\" offer up a formidable dose of jazz fare with unbelievably witty lyrics.      The production here is very clean and mostly organic (e.g. classical guitars, real drums/percussion, etc.).  The one notable exception is \\"Summer In New York\\" which features electronic drums and synth patches.  Fortunately, it also happens to be a flawless composition that is undeniably groovy.  And the drum/keyboard programming doesn't obstruct the brilliance inherent in the tune.  The tasty trumpet solo also helps create a perfectly laid-back atmosphere.  Finally, \\"Time Together\\" features a number of bossa-nova songs that round out the album.  I am a huge fan of Michael's Brazilian leanings, and, for me, \\"One Day In St. Tropez\\" and \\"Samba Blue\\" don't disappoint!      In summation, forget all of the fodder that radio stations will try to pass off as this year's \\"summer anthem.\\"  This is it.  A perfect summer album.  Grab a good book, an ice-cold lemonade, and enjoy.  Thank you, Michael, for your veritable contributions to music...
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After falling in love with the FIREFLY series and cast, I was thrilled to discover a \\"sequel\\" movie. It was like a delicious and deserved reward for fans who hated to see the series gone. Here's hoping Nathan can take a break from the wonderful CASTLE series to film another FIREFLY/SERENITY movie, or two, or three. It's a good edition to anybody's FIREFLY collection.
B00544L9EI|5.0|I haven't been excited about Hip Hop since about 2001, and now its like Em is baaaaaack, Royce is getting the respect he deserves, and slaughter house is here. So buy this album, BUY it its worth the Eight bucks!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I got into this series mid-way of Season 2, so it was wonderful to buy and watch Season 1 over a 2-day period. I watched everything about the show and cast; that was a huge help with catching up with everybody and everything. I rank this way higher than TWILIGHT series. If you like vampires, you will love this series. Ranks high like MOONLIGHT, BUFFY, and ANGEL, all of which I've purchased and retained. Thanks, Amazon, for helping me obtain all the seasons/series at good prices.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Perfect headphones for running, lifting and any other activity.  I have 2 pairs (one at work, one for home use), just ordered one more for my wife.    5 stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Found FIREFLY by \\"accident\\" one night and began watching the series reruns midway. I was thrilled to find the entire series on Amazon, so I could watch all the episodes I had missed. Cannot imagine why such a terrific series was cancelled and why no other network picked it up. Love Nathan Fillion in this series, but also love him in CASTLE. He is one talented actor in whatever role he plays. Glad I discovered FIREFLY before too many others did and the price went up. They put a perfect cast together with amazing stories and special effects. LOVE IT! BUT---- says on back cover that it includes\\"3 unaired Episodes\\" besides the 14 series episodes, so where are they?????????
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a really fun and addicting game.  Only complaint is the initial load time but the game is so good I can totally over look it.   some people say the graphics are extremely pixelated but on my HTC EVO 4G, the graphics are crisp, sharp, simply great!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|It was not as good as I would have hoped. Slow to start then gets good in the middle.But the Ending left you with to many unanswered queitions.
B004289ZW0|5.0|The compact size lends itself to easy storage and easy mounting on top of the aircraft panel.  Despite its small size it is a strong receiver and provides reliable navigation data.  I use it with my I Phone 4.
B004X0XA82|2.0|I first heard Fleet Foxes music on their Sun Giant album.  It was great.  I still like it and listen frequently.  The second album had some great music also.    This third album is just not as good.  It has a couple of decent songs, but it is rather bland and seems to lack something that was on the first albums.
B0024FA9IM|4.0|I know it's not everyone's favorite, but what can I do, I love it flaws and all.  For years I've been waiting for someone to come along and kick start this franchise again and pick up where this film left off, but no such luck.  I might have to just go do it myself.  If you loved the original series, you've got a 50/50 chance of liking this one.  I won't say \\"love\\" because that's a strong word and I wouldn't want to presume anyone other than myself and a small group of sheltered individuals \\"love\\" this film.  Which is a shame, because it is in no way a bad film.  In fact I've been surprised not to see this get rehashed and drowned in heavy TBS rotation like a lot of other sub-successful films.    The film has a solid and seasoned cast, for the most part.  Much like the original series, the script keeps to the core characters and terrorizes them with one to two aliens and a number of major environmental disaster situations that keep the action moving.  The primary conflicts are internal, which I think generate the best results.  Think of the worst family road trip you've ever been on, then add in being marooned on a distant foreign planet.  Throw in some nice special effects, and roller-coaster like sequences and you're off to the races.    Though my review might be seen as about as successful as this films' debut, I feel it's in good company.  So why not give it a shot, or not.  Either way, I still love it and will enjoy it again and again on my new Blu-Ray DVD.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|It was nice being able to get a different perspective than from \\"Something Borrowed\\". It was a much faster read and again at times a little boring. Nice easy read.
1859260012|1.0|This is the second time I have tried to get a  complete works of William Shakespeare in Spanish and they send me the English edition. I paid 29.29 cents to return a  set of books that cost only 22 dollars to purchase. Not happy. Dan C
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|i     I read this for my book club and could not wait for it to end.   I could see no point znd very little story line.  Don`f waste your time.
B000TENE6Y|5.0|This is the most important album of all time. People who don't agree with me should have their music listening privileges taken away permanently. Seriously.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|What an amazing performance Natalie Portman brought to this film. Her tranformation form the meek, barely  audible, and innocent white swan to the seething, aroused and wicked black swan is nothing less than superlative. I got chills at the end of her dance as the provocative black swan.   I will watch it agin and again
1416589473|5.0|Always been a fan of Guild Wars, I'm a semi avid reader so I do diversify myself with many books and this one was very well written and interesting.<br /><br />Only gripe is that it's short.
B004WJRDN2|4.0|I'd give this a solid four stars for the music (it includes some great songs along with some less impressive fragments), five stars for the remastering and production, and 4 stars for the overall package. I'd like to have seen more commentary on the individual tracks and more commentary by McCartney on each track. However, this is still an appealing package for McCartney completists. Remastering is very sharp and clean, and it can particularly be appreciated on the high-res downloads that are available via an access code (it didn't work initially, but the technical glitches have now been corrected). If you're just interested in the music, buy the less expensive version.
B004K4AVAG|2.0|My wife got it as a gift (from a co-worker) and she's already calling Gaga pass&eacute;, after just a fortnight.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed a few tracks, but I'm just fine with her letting it go.
B004WJREPO|4.0|This isn't one of McCartney's best albums, but I knew that before I ordered it. Many of the songs seem like throwaways. However, the package is quite nice--well-designed hardcover book that offers background info on the album, and a link to high-res downloads (this link wasn't working initially, but has been repaired). I only recommend this for McCartney completists due to the price, however; if all you want is the music, buy the less expensive version.
159514188X|4.0|I really liked this book; however, being a middle school librarian, the message of this novel concerns me.  This book is marketed to teenagers, and I kept waiting for the author to pull the main character up ... this never happened.  The book gives an adult a look into the teenage mind and how things an adult may perceive as small have a much greater affect on a teenager.  The main character travels through the book in a depression, and is almost unaccepting of any help extended to her along the way.  In my opinion, the message being sent is there is no hope and the only alternative is to take your life.  I believe this is a good read for an adult, and something that might help someone recognize the warning signs.  I do not, however, recommend this book for a teenager.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|- The special effects look amazing and very real to me.    - The actions scene are quick, deadly and exciting.    - There is also a little bit of character development. For example, the scene where the marines sacrificed themselves to protect civilians. Another scene where the father asked the marine to take care of his child.    - Yes, as some people said, the spaceship looks very much like a copy from District 9. However, that does not make this picture less entertaining.    What else can I ask for? Nothing. If you love war movies, you'll love this.   My friend and I watched it in the theater. I'm going to buy a DVD copy of it too.
B0026MEM4K|5.0|I have the SACD version of this and thought I wouldn't be impressed by the MFSL disc. Boy, was I wrong! This has to be the best redbook CD I've heard. Open, warm, crystal clear details! The bass has more presense. There are segments that actually seem like surround sound. Simply a stunning production!
B001EN71CW|5.0|For anyone who still has not seen Firefly, this is your chance. Get the best quality version you can and enjoy. Be sure to watch [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity [Blu-ray]]] after seeing this series. The only unfortunate aspect of buying and watching these is that there are not more.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|This Tron is a good Tron. I am a bit of a fan of the original tron. The original Tron had/has a younger jeff bridges in it. This Tron: Legacy has an older jeff Bridges. I am a person that bases movies on their original counterparts. I really like to older Tron. The newer Tron: Legacy is pretty good, but I am conparing it to the older Tron. I really can not do that since each movie has its own guidelines to go by. Tron was an original, Tron: Legancy is a Tron of the future - Tron. SO, each has it's own point of interest going for it. I would say. Stop here with the Trons.
B0000024LN|5.0|This is my FAVORITE Redman album, he just KILLS it on Muddy Waters. The skits on this record are HIGHlarious too.
B000002TP7|5.0|This is by far one of the B Boys best records, every track is KILLER. Back in high school we could not stop with this record, now in 2011 I still am blown away by it.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|I purchased the PX21 headset last October as I have a PS3 and usually play after everyone else in the house goes to bed.  This allowed me to have an audio headset and even have the option to chat when I wanted.  I bought these because 1)Turtle Beach has a good rep with fellow gamers 2)It was their cheapest headset for the PS3 before the P11 came along.  I used the headset almost every night for about 3 months and was EXTREMELY impressed with the audio and chat functions.  Bass was perfect and chat from my end didn't seem to be too overpowering or underpowered.  Then one day in January I start hearing what sounds like a loose connection in the left earpiece.  The next day I go to put them on and the left earpiece COMPLETELY SEPERATES from the headset, now only being held on by the wire running through it.  I want everyone to understand, THIS HEADSET WAS NOT MISTREATED PRIOR TO THIS OCCURING!  I'm a 37 year old avid gamer (that's right ladies, I know that turned you on) that takes care of what he has.  These were put away every night and my kids never touched them.      I contacted Turtle Beach and, after supplying them with a copy of my purchase receipt, gave me a return number so I could send them back under warranty.    A few weeks later, near the end of February/beginning of March, I received a new set.  These worked fine until a week ago (3 MONTHS LATER) when the left earpiece AGAIN seperated from the headpiece.  I don't for one second believe they returned my original set because I inspected the new ones carefully, plus they were sealed in a new package.  So what that says to me is that the PX21 has a FACTORY DEFECT that causes this issue.      I have returned the new set (still under warranty) to Turtle Beach and am currently awaiting their return.  Once they send me a new set I will be selling them brand new/sealed and purchasing the P11 headset.  Now I know most of you would say, \\"Why would you want another Turtle Beach brand?\\".  The answer is that I believethe fault with the PX21 is the articulation joint where the earpiece connects to the headpiece.  The earpiece swivels on this joint and just seems to me to be a weak point.  The P11 seems to be made completely different and looks more like what I want.  I liked the sound quality with these and I still believe Turtle Beach is a reputable brand, there's just a flaw in this particular model.
B004C5M282|5.0|Simply put, Volbeat is the most creative band to hit Rock & Roll in years.  Their combination of different musical genres with a heavy metal delivery is simply AWESOME.  Do not miss this band.  Buy this CD now.
031261246X|5.0|Just wanted to compliment the author on a great book. I read a lot of suspense/mystery type books, this was one of the best I've read.     I stayed up late last night to finish the book...couldn't put it down.     I liked the story and especially all you information on the computer & internet.      Hope to see the next book soon, from Mark Russinovich!
B004LROMSO|2.0|If you haven't seen this series, find it online first before you purchase.  It's full of inconsistent writing and mis-casting.  I wouldn't waste my money to purchase this....but find it online and view it for yourself before you spend your money on something you'd re-gift if someone gave it to you.
B001GCUO16|4.0|The movie is great thats why I purchased it. I'm writing this review because the BR box was DAMAGED and the disk had like a little print(kind of looks like a finger print and the BR is \\"new\\"). The Amazon box was in perfect conditions so it wasn't UPS who mishandled the package I think it was the warehouse were this BR movie was lingering. To be more precise about the damage, the back of the BR box has a like 1 inch dent, the cover art is ripped and it's just messed up. I trust Amazon handles their merchandize a little more serious. I could return it but for all it's worth it, its not worth my time. Im just hoping this never happens again.BTW this movie arrived kind of fast considering It was a \\"standard shipping\\" order about 3 -4 days after I ordered it, it arrived.
B0000C4LXG|5.0|If you look up the definition of black metal in the dictionary, Mayhems \\"Deathcrush\\" album will be right there!  This is to me what black metal should truly sound like.<br /><br />This album is short and sweet (not really, its freakin brutal).  Listening to Maniac sing is like listening to a demon in hell preaching a black mass.  How could you not love a black metal album that has a song composed and recorded by a member of Tangerine Dream?! And the lyrics would make a band like Pungent Stench and Cannibal Corpse proud (just look up the lyrics to 'Chainsaw Gutsf**k'). I have converted many into Mayhem fans with this album and it is worth every penny.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 2 1/2 yr old daughter really wanted to watch this movie, so I bought it. My daughter is probably too young to watch these movies. the villains (two guys & mother) freaked her out the first time she saw the movie. She still wants to watch the movie because of Rapunzel and the songs she sings, so we just FF through all the scenes with the villains.     I loved every minute of it. Reminded me of the old school (1990's) princess movies. At the end when he cut off her hair...aaah....what a romantic gesture!    The Blue-Ray disc had these little \\"commercials\\" in the bonus features that were HILARIOUS!     Disney princesses are back!!
B004HO6HWK|4.0|This Movie is exactly as I expected it to be, decent and worth watching!    When it comes to re-makes you have to forget about the original and just enjoy what your currently watching. It will help with this movie for sure, I liked it and found the Actors to do a much better job then I figured they would.    Not bad Blu-Ray quality either
B0034JKZ3G|3.0|Not appropriate for little kids with all that voodoo stuff.     The prince annoyed me...no character at all.     Music was good...what I remember of it...I ended up falling asleep.
B004RE29WW|4.0|I can vividly remember the teaser trailer for this film during the summer of '91. It was a basic shot of the alien egg cracking open and a narrative that said: \\" In 1979 we discovered in space, no one can hear you scream, in 1992 we will discover on earth everyone can hear you scream\\" Obviously the course of the movies plot never ended up on earth and what we did get was a plot set on a prison planet and Ripley crash lands there. All of the events of Aliens and the relationships established by Ripley, Hicks and Newt where all vanished because of the nature this movie was made and changed hands up until production. The making of the movie is much more better then the finished product. That's not to say Alien 3 is a total turd. It has some good moments, but that is all I am at liberty to say. Included is the original '92 theatrical cut as well as a producer's cut made at the time of the Anthology DVD release back in 2003. PQ & AQ are just as good as the previous 2 films and all the nice extra's to go with it. In the end Alien 3 was a let down of sorts, but for a true Alien fan, Alien 3 deserves a place on your shelf.
0307454541|1.0|A neighbor lent me this book and told me it was a \\"must read\\". After about half way in, I wanted to quit because I found the ridiculous genealogy (that literally lasted for about 200 pages) to be a total snore. The second half of the book, which I am guessing is what many reviewers referred to as a \\"sexy thriller\\", was beyond awful. As a warning, it includes very GRAPHIC rape scenes some of which aren't even necessary for the storyline. The only reasons I finished reading the book are 1) so I could tell my neighbor I actually did read the book and 2) to give this book an awful review! I do not understand the praise surrounding this novel!

1557048630|5.0|I saw the movie and read the 'How to Train your Dragon' books and loved them, so I decided to try this book. I enjoyed every minute that I spent reading 'The Art of How to Train your Dragon' and it has become one of my favorite books I've ever read; it has great pictures that are full of color and character, and it tells you about the things they had to do and tweak while making the movie. It was so impressive to read about how specific the makers of the movie were about every small detail and the hard work they put into making 'How to Train your Dragon' The Movie. My favorite part I read in this book was when it talked about all the different options they explored while designing the characters and the dragons.  This book is without a doubt worth reading, it really helps you appreciate the movie and the people that took the time to make that movie as phenomenal as it is. I would recommend 'The Art of How to Train your Dragon' to anyone that loved the movie or the books; this book is fantastic!
B000EOTEPO|5.0|Immortal are now one of the undisputedly godliest icons of the Norwegian black metal circuit. But everybody has to start somewhere. The earliest parts of the band's career consisted of extremely raw and heavy black metal albums which ranged from mediocre-to-pretty good. (Although, granted, one exception to this rule has to be made for 1997's \\"Blizzard Beasts,\\" which opted for a brutal black metal-by-way-of-Morbid Angel-lite-American death metal approach. The album was an exceptional one, thanks largely to Horgh's inhuman drumming.) And sure, many flashes of brilliance could frequently be heard throughout the band's career as young musicians. But something was usually still left to be desired from these early efforts. Various drawbacks included a lack of coast-to-coast consistency, a truly groundbreaking and landmark sound, and crisp and articulate production jobs. And there was an occasional rush job - the kind that left listeners scratching their heads. Everybody knew they were more-than-capable of finally releasing the great album that everybody knew they had in them. Only then could the group could the band fully grasp the true greatness and staying power that they had been flirting with for so many years. And only then could they start to warrant the status that they are now deadlocked in.<br /><br />Well, all of that changed starting with the year 1999. With Horgh now a committed, full-time member Immortal could now settle down, and devote more of their time to more important things. Great songwriting and increasingly technical musicianship being two main examples. And lucky for us, their efforts paid off. Big time, too, because the result was `99's \\"At The Heart Of Winter,\\" which was not only a satisfying new album, and a completely realized affair. It is the sound of a band that is now truly firing on all cylinders, too. So, frankly put, it is an indisputably smashing success on all fronts. Some elements remain from previous works, including skin-crawling and venomous vocal rasps that remain as true to pure black metal as ever. Overall, though, a huge improvement (who said \\"change\\") in sound has been made, here. As a result, Immortal suddenly sound many years smarter and more mature.<br /><br />Only six songs may be presented here, but Immortal make more out of them than most bands can do with at least twice as many. Pick any given one of them, and you are sure to be satiated with it. Why? Because not-a-one of them isn't extremely expansive, innovative, complex, tight as a drum, epically epic (with songs being in the six-to-eight minutes margin), deliciously multi-faceted, and brillliantly written. The guitars are definitely the most integral part of the music is definitely the guitars, so it is imperative that Abbath sounds more dangerous than ever before. Well, he accomplished that goal without even breaking a sweat. After obviously spent some time boning up on some of metal's all-time most important genres, Eighties thrash, he is able to create mountains and mountains of wonderful shredding. Sounding almost like he is constantly engaged in a dogfight with himself, Abbath deftly spits out insanely intricate, razor-sharp, wrist-spraining, and positively godly riffage, fiery thrash picking, impeccably tight leads, and exceptional solos. Elsewhere, it is impossible to not mention Horgh, the man who has been one of the finest drummers in black metal for quite a while now. And he is also the man who anchors these songs with an endless flood of blistering, foundation-shaking black metal blasts, and occasional Lombardo-worthy thrash beats. Yet, for all of its brutal and breakneck parts and qualities, the music simultaneously manages to also include melody. Fortunately, unlike many-a-black-metal case, these melodies are never boring or tacked on. But they never feel excessive, either. So that is another big part of what makes \\"At The Heart Of Winter\\" so masterful. It expertly weaves in things like tastefully melodic guitar work and occasional keyboard flourishes to create melodic parts that are as prominent as they are memorable and infectious.<br /><br />The standouts are many. The double-kick-backed opener \\"Withstand The Fall Of Time\\" splits its time equally between revving up the engines with propulsive, crunching thrash, and settling back down into more restrained chugging and mid-tempo grooves. Regardless of the speed the guitars, though, Horgh can always be heard thumping away at his bass drum like there's no tomorrow. Following this, the next couple of tracks \\"Solarfall\\" and \\"Tragedies Blows At Horizon\\" come next, and they much alike one-another. Opting for a really blistering approach, these two tracks could easily be mistaken for a prime couple of pieces of thrash from two decades ago. They both recall the halcyon days from the likes of Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, Sadus, Testament, Sepultura, Dark Angel, etc. \\"Solarfall\\" and \\"Tragedies Blows At Horizon\\"  are also similar in that, aside from the occasional and brief dabbling with a softly picked-string softly-picked string section, they both continuously shred your speakers. The former offsets some squealing guitar runs with busy, chunked-up picking; and the latter has really huge riffs anchored by slamming drum blasts. Continuing on, even though there should have never been  any debate about it before, \\"Where Dark And Light Don't Differ\\", with its guitar leads that are positively scorching and fairly strong and solid bass work, further ensures that the intensity level is firmly glued in the upper red zone. The title tune is perhaps the best of the whole bunch. It begins as a awesomely beautiful and atmosphere-enhancing serene ballad with a lush musical arrangement comprised of thoroughly noteworthy and spacey-sounding keyboards, docile melodic guitar strums, and a faint choral backing vocal line. Eventually, though, it all ends up being heavy as a ton of bricks - brutal drumming and monstrous stop-start guitar flurries steamroll everything around. Lastly, we get \\"Years Of Silent Sorrow,\\" which is basically one, long, inexorable flood of great, biting, nerve-damaging buzzsaw speed metal riffage.<br /><br />\\"At The Heart Of Winter\\" not only stands as easily the finest installment in Immortal's long and storied discography, and is in and by itself a landmark metal album. And no matter which genre it belongs to (black, thrash, speed, or symphonic metal), it should be equally regarded as essential listening.nal keyboard flourishes to create melodic parts that are as prominent as they are memorable and infectious.

1442419814|5.0|I'm sure I'm close to the last person in the blogging world to read the Uglies series but that's ok. I am now and I'm loving them. Uglies by Scott Westerfeld was a great read for me. I enjoyed it so much that when I finished it I moved on to Pretties right away (already finished that one too-review on it's way). What a great series! Anyhow, on to what I thought of Uglies.<br /><br />Uglies is about a post-apocalyptic world where everyone is changed to a pretty when they turn sixteen. The purpose is if you make everyone pretty then nobody can be judged on their appearance alone - everyone is on equal ground. The rest of the world, our present world presumably, has been destroyed; they called the people of this world the Rusties. The Pretties are pretty much mindless people living life to the fullest or as full as you can when you really don't do any thinking anymore and the worst thing is they don't even realize this is what has happened to them.<br /><br />The book centers on Tally Youngblood. She's fifteen and living in the dorms for uglies while waiting to become a pretty on her sixteenth birthday. She can't wait; she longingly watches out her dorm window towards where the pretties are always partying. As well her friend Peris turned pretty before her and she's lost without him. They were best friends and she can't wait until they are together again.<br /><br />Then Tally meets another girl with the same birthday as her - Shay, and they become fast friends playing tricks together and causing the normal 'ugly' trouble. Shay is different from Tally's other friends though. She questions becoming pretty and takes Tally to the Rusty Ruins and tells her about some mysterious place called the Smoke where uglies live like normal people. This makes no sense to Tally. Why would anybody not want to become pretty but it seems that Shay doesn't.<br /><br />On Tally's sixteenth birthday she is ready to go and have her operation and be a pretty. Imagine her surprise when she's told she can't become a pretty until she finds Shay who ran away and leads the Specials to the Smoke. At first Tally resists but then realizes that there is no way she'll have the life she wants if she doesn't do this. So, she agrees to find Shay and the people of the Smoke.<br /><br />What Tally doesn't expect when she finds the Smoke is that these people aren't so bad and neither is this life. Unexpectedly Tally finds that she cares about these people and doesn't want to expose them but is it too late? Is it too late for all them, including Tally?<br /><br />Uglies is a great look into what a society would be if people were manipulated into what those in higher power wanted for them. This book is action packed and keeps you turning the pages until the early morning hours to finish. Keep an eye out for my review of Pretties coming up soon as well.til she finds Shay who ran away and leads the Specials to the Smoke.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|The product comes in a frustration free packaging. It can't get any simpler than just cutting the seal and flipping open the box.    The iPhone case is made of thermoplastic polyurethane, a type of plastics that is elastic and resistant to oil and abrasion. I like to think of it as a hybrid between a hard case and a soft case. It is not a rigid case that comprises of two separate parts that snap together to encase your iPhone. It is not soft that it won't hold up to the daily abuses. Personally, I prefer this type of case over a hard case since I had bad experience with a hard case that has irregularity in the interior surface that ruined an older iPhone model of mine.    The case I've got is in translucent smoke color. It has some subtle pattern on the back along with a circular cutout to expose the Apple logo on the phone (and a hole for the camera, of course). All the cutouts for the controls and connectors line up properly. For daily use with reasonable care, this case offers good enough protection. If you tend to subject your iPhone to abuses, you may want to consider a more protective (bulky) case such as a Ballistic case.    The screen protector provided is another story. The quality is not that great. It exhibits rainbow effect under *certain* lighting conditions, and it gets scratches and fingerprints rather easily. However, it is precision cut with perfect alignment to the home button, camera and the receiver holes. The package comes with a lint-free cloth and a plastic square to sneeze out any bubbles while applying the protector.    Overall, this is a very good deal. For under $10, you're getting a great TPU case and a so so screen protector. Some brands are charging more than twice as much just for a TPU case.
B002G1K82Q|4.0|I bought this movie as a birthday gift for a friend, who absolutely loves it. If you love Beatles music and some musical acting great this movie is for you! The singing abilities in this movie are quite spectacular but some of the characters are somewhat annoying at times.
0307454541|1.0|I'm not a huge writer of reviews. This is mostly because I cannot formulate the accurate words to describe a product. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, however, makes this task simple. Please note that I only got through half of the book as I could not waste my time reading any more.<br /><br />I, like most people I assume, was interested in the hype. After seeing many passengers on BART reading these series of books, I had to see what was so great about them. Turns out, it was a lot of nothing. Larsson makes the book drag and drag with only a few interesting things sprinkled here and there. When I left off (again HALFWAY in the book) ABSOLUTELY NOTHING had been revealed. It was just Blomkvist going around \\"oh man, i can't solve this. hurrggggh\\" and the only truly interesting thing Salander did was *spoiler: threaten her new guardian*. That's it. I mean, there is of course little tidbits of information being given to the reader, but nothing of value or anything that really progresses the story. There were times when the most exciting thing was Blomkvist going inside the local cafe on his MacBook, not getting any farther in this \\"mystery\\", and going home to screw either his neighbor or business partner. In simple terms, this books pacing is REALLY SLOW. I cannot emphasize this enough.<br /><br />I find it sad that a book with such notoriety is such balderdash. I find it even more sad that the trailer for the movie makes me want to finish the book. Maybe sometime in the future I will, but I think I'll stick with a wikipedia plot summary as this book isn't worth the time.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is still a fun game. It plays well when it's running and works ok for the most part. However, the dearth of options between this and the PC and iOS version are very disappointing. Very few bonus stages have made the transition and due to this replayability is quite limited. Also if you answer a notification the whole game needs to restart. Overall average. Could've been great if they had added more features.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I found myself drawn into the series from the first episode. The actors are fanatastic. Most of them are normally relegated to secondary status in just about every instance I have ever seen them perform, but they are all wonderful character actors and they truly shine in this environment. And who knew Katy Sagal was such an incredible actress? I found her a good comedienne but she certainly deserves the Golden Globe she won for her protrayl of Gemma in this series.    The show itself is very well written with an interesting story arch and numerous beta stories that tie the whole into a neat package. I can't recommend the series enough. One thing, it does portray extreme violence in a graphic manner, as well as regularly depicts druguse, criminal activity and murder to further the stories. Anyone that may be offended by such things, even in a fictional way, should avoid this series. Obviously children should not be allowed to watch the series either.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Martin Scorsese's \\"Shutter Island\\" is a psychological thriller done in a florid, grand opera style.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play two federal marshals circa the 1950s who've been sent to an isolated institute for the criminally insane, run by Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the patients there, a Medea-like figure who killed her own children a number of years back.  DiCaprio's character is also haunted by memories and dreams of his young wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire, and by his own traumatizing experience liberating Dachau at the close of World War II.  The two investigators soon discover that everything is not quite what it appears to be on Shutter Island and that indeed something quite nefarious and sinister may be going on there.<br /><br />Ever the agent provocateur, Scorsese brings a healthy dose of his trademarked purple-prose filmmaking style to the proceedings.  He sets his tale against a backdrop of howling winds, crashing waves and falling trees, punctuated by thundering chords pounding away on the soundtrack.  It may make the movie seem preposterously pretentious at first, but we soon learn that there is a method to Scorsese's madness, as what appears initially to be gratuitous showmanship on the part of the director becomes an integral part of the work once the details of the story emerge.<br /><br />This theme of who-is-truly-mad-and-who-is-truly-sane in this world has been played out many times before in the movies, but \\"Shutter Island\\" brings a level of sophistication to it that is really quite impressive.  The movie keeps us guessing at every stage of the drama, with the twists and turns of the storyline drawing us ever deeper into the surrealistic, fractured world it's created for itself.<br /><br />DiCaprio and Ruffalo both turn in outstanding performances, but this is Scorsese's movie all the way.

B0031RAOVY|1.0|The true story of Hachi was in Japan, in 1924. It was a touching story, not this nastiness spewed out by Hollywood.      Not only was this movie nothing like the true story of Hachi, it was probably one of the most vile stories of cruelty and neglect. I found myself wanting to crawl through the screen to slap these people silly. I could somewhat forgive the wife, she did not want the dog in the first place, but the ridiculous daughter just letting him go? Obviously the characters of this movie did not have a single viable functioning brain cell between them!      The part that offended me most was the scene 9 years post death, Hachi, dirty, old, slow, makes his way to the station, and the stupid wife sees him. Supposed to be all touching, here I was hoping Hachi would rip out her throat. Useless woman.      Why am I so angry about a stupid movie? Look to the fact that this stupid rotten movie caused the mindless masses to rush out and buy Akitas by the hoard... these are strong willed dogs, not for the stupid, lazy or even well meaning inexperienced.     No, this movie should not be supported for anything. The only character worth anything was the dog. Though, truth be told, that is very like reality. Dogs are the best people, and people can be completely useless in their self absorption and pettiness.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|We have \\"Plants vs Zombies\\" for several other platforms (iPod Touch and Xbox 360) and the game play on the Android is every bit as good as the others. The game centers around a zombie invasion and you are only given a variety of plants with different defensive and offensive abilities to protect your front yard. The early levels are fairly easy but the waves of zombies become more intense and the zombies gain additional abilities in the higher levels, but fortunately you also get additional plants with increased abilities as well as the game progresses.<br /><br />This is a very addictive game with good controls that works perfectly on my HTC EVO.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
B0034G4ORM|5.0|I immediately ordered the movie after renting it out.  For an action flick the acting wasn't too bad in addition to a fantastic story line.  You can tell the director made sure you were right there along side the characters in the movie blasting aliens and grinding it out to take Los Angeles back.  It is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time since Independence Day.  Don't miss it. HooRahh!

0395925037|5.0|Great historical reference.  Hitler's work lays out the architecture of what would become life in the Third Reich. Had this work been taken seriously, history would certainly have been altered. It is clear from this work all non Aryans could not live in his new Germany and the antisemetic ranting clearly sets out what policies to be put in place in dealing with the Jews of Europe. Chillingly, the steps to the final solution to the Jewish question was laid out years before it would take place, yet the world chose to ignore it. This work should be considered as an imperative read for all historical scholars.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's current hit song is on this album.  I love the song although I am getting tired of it being played over and over and over again on all the radio stations.  They should be playing all of her songs as they are all very good.  There isn't a song I don't like on this album or on her album titled 19
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|As always it is necessary to say what (which?) edition you are reviewing due to Amazon's policy of lumping all reviews of the movie in one batch.<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Blu Ray edition is wonderful. The special features make up the majority of this package because the original film (which looks great in Blu Ray) is very short. The Special Features include a long documentary on the making of the film and then lots of shorter detailed stuff, trailers, etc.<br /><br />Psycho was made when Hitchcock was at the height of his Television career and it was his last film at Paramount. He wanted very much to do this after seeing a review of Robert Bloch's book and then reading the book. He wanted to make it for less than $1,000,000 (which was still a lot in those days) so he did it with his Television crew. He also to have at least one big star in it. Janet Leigh agreed to make the film without seeing a screenplay or even knowing what they would pay her; Hitchcock was so big in those days actors would do most anything to work with him. Anthony Perkins, who was not as big but still a major star, had agreed to do the film with as little information. In my opinion Perkins should have at least been nominated for an Oscar (he did receive the Best Actor Award from the International Board of Motion Picture Reviewers) for Psycho, but there you go.<br /><br />The film is about as 'bare bones' as it gets. Hitchcock made films for the public and did not care much what critics or 'film makers' thought. He wanted, more than anything, to have people enjoy his films.<br /><br />Even though you know what's going to happen and the 'surprise' ending this film is still a hoot to watch. I still jumped at all the right moments and was very pleased at the end. I watched and enjoyed all the features; even the ones that are a bit repetitive. Highly recommended.

I suppose I should not be surprised, since I could not finish the last HP book either, but I was hoping for something better.

0439023513|4.0|In reading some of the comments, not everyone is all that happy about this last book.  Some say it is too violent for YA, but how can anyone call the first 2 not violent?.  Others say it is anti-war, since it makes war look very unpleasant, and it did not have a happy ending.  Some are not happy with Katniss character development, which I tend to agree with.  Still others are disappointed in how the love triangle was resolved.    To me, it was a readable book and while Katniss came off as a immature, self-centered and rather thick, the  message was an important one, which is that their are limits to what a government should do to ensure it's citizens safety, and it's hold on power.  Here is why.    Leading up to the final book of the trilogy, we have an authoritarian central government based in the Capitol that maintains control of 12 Districts. These Districts were defeated in a previous war, and having \\"Hunger Games\\" was one of the methods of keeping the districts in line and Capitol citizens safe and well entertained.  These annual games killed off 23 of the 24 child tributes who were randomly selected from each Districts teenage population at large, with a bias toward those who were poor, and 24/7 TV coverage.    Other means of control were through their security forces, having an Orwellian name of \\"Peacemakers\\".  Their brutal tactics to control order terrorized the population, and the constant hidden surveillance made people fearful of talking about it.   Most of the people in the Districts are poor and have little to eat, while those in the Capitol are well off with plenty of food, as are those favoured Districts which train the Peacemakers who come from all districts and hold the military bases.  The media was an important tool of the Capitol in terms of influencing peoples opinions with relentless propaganda.    .......spoiler alert....    After surviving 2 Hunger Games, the first of which led Katniss to get on President Snows bad side as she showed what hebelieved to be revolutionary tendencies, and the 2nd of which led to her home districts destruction after she destroyed the dome that held the games and prematurely ended them, certainly a revolutionary act in his mind, Katniss finds herself in the hands of revolutionaries from District 13. Everyone outside the Capitol was led to believe District 13 was unpopulated after being destroyed in the war 75 years ago.    District 13 citizens lived under a state of martial law with virtually no freedoms as a result of the 75 year old cold war with the Capitol, each with nuclear weapons that bother were afraid to use.  The other 12 districts had little freedom, and were occupied by security forces sent by the Capitol to enforce order.        So in the revolution to take over power from President Snow and the Capitol, we see Coin as leader of Distric 13 seeking to use Katniss as a propaganda tool for the revolution.  Later on, she authorizes the killing of children in the Capitol to blame it on her opponents and then a 2nd strike to wipe out her own people who were sent in to rescue and treat the survivors, which was also blamed on Capitol forces/peacemakers, all to weaken resistance from Capitol citizens who would buy this strong propaganda and surrender out of disgust.    When Coin's forces are victorious, and President Snow is under arrest awaiting execution, Coin calls in the survivors of the games, only 6 left.  She wants them to vote on continuing the games, but this time with Capitol children, to quench the thirst for blood by those who wish to exterminate the remaining Capitol citizens .  Inexplicably, Katniss votes yes along with 3 others, outvoting Peeta and Anna.         So the forces of good show themselves to be no better than those who were considered to be the forces of evil.  As always, they justify their actions by  \\"the end justifies the means\\" , and  anything is justified to \\"keep us safe\\".      Only Katniss assasination of Coin prior to Snows execution prevents here from assuming power and implementing the games.  Somehow Katniss was found not guilty in a trial she never attended or witnessed.  Not very believable to me, but then you could not very well end the book with the victorious forces of good implementing the same evil games and tactics, justified only to keep the District citizens and those in power safe.

We have a Canon Camera and this backpack is great, it's literally the same as the canon backpack just different color, but I like the black better and I think it's cheaper even, so if you're debating go for the cheaper one, they are the same!
B002HRTMHQ|5.0|Mayer Hawthorne opened for Bruno Mars at the Gibson Amphitheater and WHAT a treat. He played a 20+ minute set that had the place jumpin' I became an instant fan of their old-school sound. Check out \\"Live From Daryl's House.\\" MH is the featured guest on the newest, just posted June 15th, episode (episode #43)
B004K4AUZW|5.0|THIS CD EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS! GAGA HAS A GREAT VOICE, AND IT SHINES IN EVERY SONG OF THE C.D. THE SECOND DISC IN THIS SET REMIXES SONGS ON C.D #1, AND THAT PART OF THE CD IS GREAT MUSICALLY, BUT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LET DOWN FOR ME, SINCE \\"SPECIAL\\" EDITION FAME MONSTER IS SUPBERB.THE MAIN ALBUM IS FANTASTIC THOUGH, AND MAY REQUIRE LISTENING TO A COUPLE TIMES TO TOTALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SONGS. I HAVE HAD IT SINCE RELEASE DAY, AND I HAVE NOT REMOVED IT FROM MY CD PLAYER YET!!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Not going to buy it on DVD, so MGM get your act together and get the Blu-ray out.    I realise your going broke, I wonder why.............................?
B004ULEEY8|4.0|The premise for the movie is interesting in that \\"ET\\" is more from Independence Day than from the hand of Spielberg. Now take every War cliche from the slaughter of innocent civilians by a truly malevolent enemy, the plundering of a country/people by the same charicature (Nazis, the Japanese, the Russians, etc...), a reluctant hero and a polyglot squad of newbies (anyone thinking Sands of Iwo Jima?). Add it all up and darn it all, it makes for a really good war movie. The special effects are very good and the blu-ray copy is almost as intense as Saving Private Ryan in the Sapphire release.  Now that the price on the BD has slid a bit, I can only say that if you like a really well-done war movie that isn't intent on shovelling special effects at you, this is worth adding to your collection.
B0051BVQFG|5.0|So many of these reviews are comparing this fun Summer blockbuster to films about or based on real stories. Blackhawk Down is a true story and Saving Private Ryan is based on a real person. This story is clearly fiction; A good movie, but FICTION. Marines are great. They bail our collective behinds out time and again - sometime when we don't even know it. But it smacks as insulting to compare these fictional Marines to those that have actually placed their lives on the line.   So, stop referring to te public as \\"Johnny Civilian\\" and stop lionizing fictional Marines and review the movie for what it is - A MUST SEE summer blockbuster that is a really well done movie. But is is - JUST A MOVIE  .
B003VANOFY|5.0|Was very satisfied with the product like usual when dealing with Logitech products.  All the issues dealing with drivers and other misc items software based was mostly fixed by downloading the updated drivers from the Logitech website or just installing from the CD inside the package.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is a great movie for the total family, you do not have to have the kids put fingers over the eyes on this one.
0345529057|5.0|OMG I love this series!!! I had been wanting to read the first book, but when I saw the box set I was like \\"HECK YES!!!!!!\\". The books came in PERFECT condition!!!  I'm almost done with the first book and can't wait to start reading the second.  If you are looking for a great summer read this series for you!!!
B004MKM8L8|4.0|I finally got to watch Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I.   While I am an adult, I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and taking my niece and nephews to see them.   This one I missed in the theaters.  I am glad I waited for the DVD release.  It mainly showcases the 3 principle actors and is filmed very dark.  It kept my interest, but was just a prequel to the big finale in Part  II.  Frankly, they could have shortened this to an hour and put it with II and shown us the movie as one big send off.  I look forward to the seeing Part II, but may wait for the DVD again.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing Sucker Punch in the cinema. I was so hyped that I even totally disregarded the negative reviews it generated right after its launch. I should have listened to IMDB.  It is OK to have a movie mainly based on action and violence. We need to vent off the anger of living in this world somehow. But even when we are hellbent on seeing things explode and people and creatures get slaughtered, in the back of our minds; deep inside a small crevice we also desire to see some coherence; some connection to the hero and some immerison in what's going on in the silver screen.  Unfortunately, Sucker Punch is just a hollow punch. It hits you square in the jaw with its stylised environments and sepia coloring (too much like \\"300\\" which was a way better movie) and stops there. It feels too long and too stretched. Characters are shallow even for an action movie. You feel no connection to the movie. The saddest thing is I ended up being bored so much that the ending which probably was supposed to shake me somewhat had no effect at all.  Sucker Punch is a good idea that looks good but ultimately is a failure.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|I used to love Hanson growing up and was excited to see they had a newer album out.  Well let me just say it's my favorite yet!  The whole album is pretty upbeat and great for the summer.  It's hard to even pick a favorite song because they are all well written with great melodies including \\"Waiting for This\\", \\"Thinking 'Bout Something\\" and \\"Musical Ride\\".  Hanson also proves they know how to slow it down with the beautiful \\"Use Me Up\\" and \\"Me Myself and I\\".  I would recommend this to all my friends!
B0034G4ORC|3.0|My title basically sums up what I think this movie is. Mind you, it is great fun. It is fast paced at certain times. Visually it is very good. And I finally found a movie where I liked Aaron Eckhart! Michelle Rodriguez happens to be my favorite action lady. What more could I ask?  Well, if the director had not decided to unnecessarily introduce silly emotional moments that stretched far too long with lots of tears and brotherly love it could have deserved a 4 star rating easily.  That and the fact that the aliens were consistently undestructible till the end would have made it perfect. At the beginning of the movie it takes a whole platoon to take out one single alien. In the final battle, a few bullets are enough to kill them. C'mon I know our dear Aaron found a soft spot but how could it be so easy??  May be I am asking for too much but Battle: LA appears to be an aspiring movie. It wants to be something remembered (like District 9). You don't become iconic with this type of approach.  All in all, it could have been great but it isn't. Is it a waste of time? Hell, no. Put aside the grey matter just a little and you will enjoy the movie.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is definitely a KEEPER. The music is over the moon...the acting is great. The kid is wonderful. I have watched it half a dozen times already. The only thing I didn't like was the Robin Williams part...But then...he did a good job being a bad guy!
1400032717|5.0|I found this book very intriguing and difficult to put down. I was fascinated by the narrator's point of view. It was so different from anything I've ever read. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a change of pace in the mystery genre or anyone looking for a little insight into the mind of autism.
0817439390|5.0|I have recently gotten interested in DSLR photography and got about five books, dealing mainly with beginner amateur photographers. Those include the masterclass book.    Since I started reading this book, I have realized what all the others were missing. They use too much technical jargon without first explaining it and talk to the beginner as if he's on their level of experience. This one stands out from the rest.     Each concept is explained in simple language with good examples and there are exercises to clarify the point further. There are awesome pictures on every page that truly reveal the concept, the author is aiming to explain.     If you only buy one book or if you are just starting off like me, pick this one. You will not regret it.     [Now I'm looking at getting some other titles from Bryan Peterson, this is so inspiring]
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Pretty good movie, I liked it and enjoyed it. However, I hated the main character so much it really kept me from really liking it...however that might have been the point. Overall I'd say it's worth a see!
B004SBQAN8|3.0|While there's no doubt that Petyfer is easy on the eyes, the movie on the whole is pretty homely.  Not a whole lot going on that isn't a tease for sequels. Not much action either until the last third of the film and then pretty cheesy at that.  So, this is just another mediocre entry in the watch this if you haven't got anything better to do and you can rent it for a buck at Redbox category.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I remember seeing this when it first came out. Had forgotten some of it, but loved it. Very entertaining. Loved seeing the actors again when they were so young and fresh faced. Good High school movie.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|What a delightful and exciting book! I got the audio from the library to listen along as I read it on my Kindle. I am glad I had little to do besides read because I don't think I could have left the book. Many great forms of philosophies were bantered about amid breath taking action. More than a few times I sat up straight, barely breathing in fear for the main characters. Pullman built believable worlds and populated them in ways that seem plausible. The actors in the borrowed audio copy on OverDrive were brilliant! I cried so much during the last few pages. I am sorry to see the end of these new friends. This, the third in the series, was the best one of all.
B000E5N6LG|5.0|After Kevin Costner's surprise hit \\"Dances with wolves\\" Hollywood considered him the king of Westerns. So it does not come as a surprise that him and director Kasdan tried to tackle the story of one of the great legends of that era. Some of the (beautifully filmed) shots seem to come right out of Costner's own movie. But this film starts out with Earp's youth and takes its time getting to Dodge City, a sheriff star and Doc Holiday. The cast is excellent and full of great names, but Dennis Quaid (who hungered himself down for the Doc role) steals every scene he is in. Sadly, the film is overly long, it would have been a great 2.5 hours movie. As it is, there is still an interesting characterization of a man who became a legend without being a shiny, perfect hero. He is flawed and sometimes even unlikable, much like most of the other characters. But that gives the film a much more realistic feel than most others from the genre. It also helps that James Newton Howard wrote one of the best Western scores ever. If only the film was a tad shorter.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I downloaded the game via Amazon Apps on my Android, but I've yet to get the update for Carnival. My husband who has an identical phone and downloaded the game using Amazon Apps already has the update. So why haven't I gotten it? I've done refresh apps, etc but nothing works.
6304711905|5.0|Hollywood once again retells the story of the legendary lawman, this time in the guise of Kurt Russell. Add Val Kilmer, Sam Neil, and Bill Paxton into the mix and what you get doesn't exactly scream \\"A list\\" but what you do have is an ensemble cast that gels particularly well; this is one of those films that manages to be more than the sum of its parts. The bond of brotherhood and friendship between the Earp's and Doc Holiday feels genuine and Kilmer clearly relishes the scene stealing part of sickly gentleman adrenaline junkie Holiday. Powers Booth and Michael Biehn also make charismatic villains, the scenes between Biehn and Kilmer being particularly sharp and the Peckinpahesque shoot outs extremely well staged. In fact the shoot out at the OK corral is one of the best versions yet filmed. It does occasionally slip into melodrama (Morgan's death being the prime example) and the climax is a little montage happy and feels a little rushed as a result, but it's a great slice of old school popular entertainment that's a lot more engaging than Kevin Costner's pompous yawn fest released the same year.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This would be on my desert island disc list. I listen to it repeatedly, and am always happy I did
B000MV9026|5.0|I am an older person whose kids are grown and out of the house so I have those good and bad/lonely days but this movie is a fixer for that!  On a downer day I can put this onto my computer and sit outside on porch with a cool ice tea and be \\"picked up\\" in spirit as Mumbles and Robin Williams can't help but bring a smile on my face.  I can understand buying this for kids and grandkids - It is an adorable film!  Buy it for yourself or kids!
B00009V93Z|2.0|I give this box set two stars because it is Elvis and because some effort was made to produce a decent sound.  Otherwise, I would give it one star.    It's largely out takes and alternate versions.  Nothing really new and undiscovered in the true sense.  A product of the desperate Elvis money machine.    However, to someone studying Elvis' recording sessions, it might have some value.
B0029NY9YO|2.0|I am a big fan of super-heroes but did not know much about DC's Watchmen.  I finally bought the movie because it was on sale and was excited to finally get to see it.  It was a bit of a disappointment, however.  The first hour nearly had me ready to turn it off, it was so boring.  I managed to make it to the ninety minute mark before giving up and honestly, I am unsure if I will try it again.  Life is too short.  Maybe fans of the comic will appreciate it more but it just wasn't for me.
B000006MS3|5.0|This is proof for me that British music is at its core weird and experimental in its nature and sound and Kate Bush perfectly encapsulates that the dreaming with its lush thick soundscapes and overtures of weird vocal styling is both weird strange and exceptionally ground breaking and brave and if gaga be a supposed extrovert and original kate bush must need sectioning this is true music and makes me proud of us weird brits for pushing boundries :P.
B001TODO54|5.0|I really enjoyed Cashore's Graceling! It was full of adventure and intrigue, the best parts of a fantasy novel. I like how Graces seem simple at first, but can grow more complex than they first appear. The world she created was so refreshing and new.<br /><br />I thought Katsa was a great character. She was tough, but evolved throughout the novel to become more sensitive and aware of herself as a person. I liked her relationship with her cousin Raffin; it was nice to see a female character have a healthy friendship with a member of the opposite sex. That doesn't happen often in books, in my opinion.<br /><br />I also appreciated that her relationship with Po didn't blossom over night; it seemed genuine and built on more than just attraction. It is frustrating that she has such a bad view of marriage, that it is more like a punishment than something happy; I'm not sure what happens in the next book, but I hope that changes. That was probably my one qualm with the novel; I'm a young woman about to be married myself, so perhaps I'm just sensitive to such an aversion to it.<br /><br />My scruples set aside, I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. Cashore knows how to build tension in the plot and interactions between characters. I am really looking forward to reading the next book!
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|It would also be helpful to have the stopper in front of your finger instead of under it but it was a lot of fun. Thanks.
B00442OD12|5.0|I bought this CD after reading the other reviews on it here on Amazon and I have no regrets. I don't speak Spanish but I may well do after listening to this CD a couple of hundred times. I love it and I am really enjoying getting to know the songs.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love you pop cap, but i cant play this game. The game will boot, then crash on my HTC Hero.
031603441X|5.0|You really can't put this thing down, once you start. It defies every stereotype there ever was about Keef: he's brilliant, possesses full recall of everything. You wish you could hang out with this guy. You will want to go back and re-read this once you're done. If you are a musician, this is the best candy around. Maybe the best rock memoir ever written, including Dylan's. All the press has been about his various digs at Mick, but they are not this book's main focus at all. Even at more than 500 pages, he glosses over much, including all but nothing to say about many albums, Bill Wyman, and many contemporaries. Still, there is so much richness here. The tale flags a bit at the end, but isn't that just like life itself?
0345529057|4.0|This is a really cool series. I would reccommend this book to anyone who truly enjoys the epic novel! In one word: Enthralling!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I like to use a this protective case along with another one with a belt clip. This one is useful to protect it while I am not carrying it around.<br />It is fairly basic but does the job and I am one of the clients who is experiencing antenna interference when holding the phone without a case. I can see the signal drop a few bars when I am holding it. Since I have started using this case, the problem has disappeared.<br />Conclusion, by itself, not that great but in combination with another case with belt clip and flip cover, it works great.
0316056863|5.0|You can love both Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in this book. A quick, funny read, Fey is insighful and clever, and I enjoyed getting to know her better.
B00140PK6O|4.0|2011-06-16
B0034G4ORM|3.0|Battle Los Angeles... i would say that this looked good in the preview but left me exhausted with the non stop fight scenes and lack of plot. I would compare it to Transformers. I had to turn it off. I think that it is worth renting, but not worth buying... once is enough.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie after all the other recently bomb-shelled releases. It gave an amazingly realistic scenario, great character development, and a &#34;In The Fight&#34; feel like Saving Private Ryan.
B004UA8D1O|1.0|It seems more like a B movie with cheesy wrote lines, and predictable sorrow... no comparison between this in Avatar. There was no magic, no stunning beauty, it was unimpressive. Rent it, save your movie for something better!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've been pleasantly surprised at the quality of Amazon-branded device cases.  This is my second Amazon case (the first being for the latest iPod Touch), and I've been consistently pleased.  This is a very competitive offering at a very competitive price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Cost: under $10 is a great price!<br />* Fit: A very snug fit means this case should offer decent drop protection.  (By contrast, my last case was the \\"splash zero Slim-Fit PolyCarbonate Case\\".  That old case was easy-on, easy-off, but offered little more than a bit of scratch protection for the back of the phone.)<br />* Looks: I like the looks of it.  It wasn't obvious to me from the pictures, but the concentric circle design on the back of the case nicely highlights the phone's Apple logo.<br /><br />Con:<br />* My only very minor complaint is that this case (compared to my previous \\"splash zero\\" case) brings with it a little more bulk.  It's not cumbersome, but it is a bit thicker than what I was used to.  To be fair, I think this is the price of having extra protection.<br /><br />The screen protector:<br />* The case comes with an adhesive screen protector, and a small tool for putting the protector on the phone.  I don't like screen protectors...I've carried my phone in my pocket a lot over the last 8 months, unprotected, and have found that the glass screen is as clean and scratch-free as it was on day one.<br /><br />Final verdict:<br />Don't be put off by the Amazon branding.  This is a good case at a good price!
0316286850|5.0|Oh My God! This book is awesome! I love the fact that it shows all the shading and highlighting and how to do it. There have been some new products that have come out since this book was published that can be used also to make the looks, but all the information is still very very relevant. A makeup artist must have!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I had watched this movie in a graduate class and loved it so I knew I had to go home and buy it. I have worked with students with autism for several years and this movie put a lot of things in perspective. I had a friend watch it with me and she loved it as well. The movie was in great condition and I received the movie very quickly!
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I bought this as my first Kindle book because I'd heard it was laugh-out-loud funny and I wanted something light to read on the plane for a trip I was taking.  I think I made it halfway through the book before I did anything but mildly chuckle.  While I did LOL several times in the last half of the book, I would by no means call this a laugh-out-loud book overall.<br /><br />As for the quality of the book beyond the laughs, it is very...stream of consciousness is the best way I can describe it but that's not really accurate. It's like the publisher asked her to write down 20 things that bothered her or were important to her or had happened to her.  There is no flow to speak of--it just goes from one random subject to another.<br /><br />It's one of those books that could have only become a best-seller by having been written by a celebrity.  If Joe Schmoe Regular Guy wrote it, it probably would never have been accepted for publication.<br /><br />Are there interesting or touching moments in it? Sure. I have been a fan of SNL for many of the years it has been on the air.  I enjoyed reading some behind-the-scenes stories about how SNL is written, etc.  I enjoyed (and agreed with) some of her feminist rants about the double standard women often face in the workplace.  I enjoyed some of the tongue-in-cheek things she had to say.<br /><br />But, for me, the bottom line is--would I go on Facebook and tell all of my friends they simply MUST read this book because it's so fabulous? No, I'm afraid not.  I enjoyed it while I was reading it, but that's about as far as it goes for me.  Sorry Tina...not being a Mean Girl...just speaking my truth (as Oprah would say).
030746363X|2.0|4HB is easy, fun, and fast reading.  The claims are inspiring and motivational but you know what they say when something sounds too good to be true.  A friend and I did 30 days on the slow carb / high protein diet and saw only marginal results beyond just feeling a bit better about my overall improved diet.    The author claims that he stopped his personal studies short of a PhD in-part because it allows him to make claims that would otherwise be scrutinized by the scientific community... Therein lies the problem. I don't doubt Mr. Ferris's personal experiments or those of the case studies he reports. However, I have to wonder if the methods and results claimed are only applicable to a small percentage of the population, based on body type, personal health history etc.      For example, if a normally health-conscious and fit skinny-person eats at McDonald's for a month and then goes on a diet, sudden weight loss will obviously be seen. Ferris admits this type of skewed data in the section about putting on ~60 pounds of muscle in 30 days (or whatever it was).  The subject of that study was a body builder who had an injury and purposely slimmed down prior to the experiment.  If the study was skewed, then why even report it? Answer: Sensational marketing to sell books.    I give it two stars because it was fun to read and inspired me to start watching what I eat more closely.
B002W5GPVE|3.0|Overall, if I were reading the physical copy of this book I would have rated it with 5 stars.  It is well written, clearly explained, and theoretically sound.  However, I purchased the Kindle edition.  Although I am still receiving some value, there are a large number of issues with the scanning or transcription of this book.  One example is this passage:  \\"Within each of have peculiar of case studies, Szanton has illustrated the principle of literal replication.\\"  Even with the context around this sentence to provide clues, I don't have a clue what that sentence is saying!  This is unfortunately one of MANY such issues with the Kindle edition of this book.  So, the book itself is still providing value, but at the expense of having to interpret a large number of unreadable passages like that one, and in some cases, at the expense of being able to discern what the author was saying.
006176759X|4.0|Although I didn't think I would like this book, when I finally decided to read it I did my best to go into it with an open mind. I am not a big fan of shows like \\"The Hills\\" and I had heard rumors that this series was similar to the show. I was afraid it would be a book with little substance and lots of fluff. I won't say this book is some profound piece of literature, but it was actually very enjoyable!<br /><br />It didn't take me long to get into the story and fall in love with the 2 main characters, Jane and Scarlett. Jane is a very lovable character, sweet and friendly. Scarlett is lovable as well, but in a totally different way. Scarlett is more straightforward and doesn't tiptoe around people's feelings, but she will do anything she can to protect Jane. As for the other 2 girls involved, Madison and Gaby, Gaby is sweet but clueless....and Madison is a character you will just have to learn about when you read the story.<br /><br />As I said before I was worried this book would fall flat, but I did really enjoy it. There were parts in the book that made me laugh out loud. Little comments between Jane and Scarlett and some off handed remarks that were quite humorous. The banter between the girls reminded me of my friends and how we joke with each other.<br /><br />There is a lot of drama going on in this story, but the reactions and the feelings of the characters really ground this book and make it more relatable. It is about more than just some well to do girls who get a big break in Hollywood. You will find yourself really rooting for Jane and wondering what Scarlett will say next. If you are passing up this book just because of the author, I think you are making a big mistake! This book is a fun read and perfect if you are in the mood for a drama filled chick lit novel!
193659451X|1.0|The print in this book is very small and I find that my eyes begin to hurt after awhile. It definitely, for me, interferes with the pleasure of reading the book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this bag as an upgrade to consolidate my two smaller camera 'totes'. (The little camera bags you buy for one camera at a big box store) Since my photography is taking me deeper into the craft I really needed something that could carry my main DSLR, three lenses, batteries, SD Cards and reader, charger, and other odds and ends. This does it with room to spare. The bag is a very nice size so it wears like any other average backpack. But you can see the work that went into designing all the compartments and layout. This is my must have, grab and go, I know everything I need is in there bag.
B00393SFU2|4.0|Generally speaking, Criterion releases are known for quality restorations and superb extra features.  This Blue-ray release of [[ASIN:B00393SFU2 M: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]]is no exception, EXCEPT with regard to the subtitles!  They are available in the German & French versions of the film, and in the interview with Fritz Lang (which, by the way, was a little tedious) but one can BARELY see them.  They are bleached in color and ALWAYS presented at the bottom of the screen within the background. That is, if a scene has a light-colored background where the subtitles are positioned, you CANNNOT see them!!!  This caused EXTREME frustration when viewing the film, 'cause one had to constantly pause the film and arrow back on the remote to try to discern the print in the subtitle!!  This alone totally disrupted the continuity of the film!!  When you pay a lot of money for a Blu-ray version of a film, you expect to be able to watch it without interruption...if you so choose, and if you want to understand the dialogue in a film with a foreign language, you need to be able to SEE the subtitles!!!    The film is, however, totally top notch, especially whenever Peter Lorre appears!!  He was a fantastic actor!!  (Spoiler ALERT!)  When you view the scene near the end where he describes his mental anguish over the criminal acts his character has perpetrated on many victims, you will appreciate his sheer genius as an actor.  Watch this scene in all three language versions of the film (German, English, and French).  In the extras, it is explained that these films were not dubbed by Lorre in the other languages, but actually RE-SHOT in each language.  His execution and elocution in each language is EXCEPTIONAL.  That particular scene (THE most famous in the film) Lorre made a little different in each language, and he was equally as effective in all!!  He was SO-O over-the-top as a dramatic actor, and he was so-o wonderful at it!!      Also, the black and white restorationis really quite splendid!  I have the earlier two-disc Criterion DVD version [[ASIN:B00065GX64 M: The Criterion Collection (Two-Disc Special Edition)]](which I have never even opened!), and there are glimpses of that version in the Blu-ray.  The differences between the two in terms of quality of black and white is remarkable!!     I was somewhat taken aback in several short scenes in the film that were shot in total silence (NO sound!).  I thought something was wrong with the disc, 'til I viewed the extras and was informed by the narrator that they were deliberately shot with NO sound.  Lang LOVED silent films and wanted those scenes to be SILENT!!     If you are a lover of older black and white films, and an admirer of FRITZ LANG and / or PETER LORRE, by all means, this verion [[ASIN:B00393SFU2 M: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]] is a stunner (EXCEPT, of course, for those blasted subtitles!!).
B004SBQAL0|4.0|My kids (11 & 15) really enjoy this movie. It was the first movie we watched with our projector and out door screen and it was a great choice. The plot does have some major holes in it, so don't expect greatness, but just sit back and enjoy the action. There is some bad language, some flirting, a lot of violence and character death. Just be warned.
B001DJLCPE|5.0|one of the best movie on my top 20     Stanley Kubrick has amazing Directing skill in this movie    I thougt it was a heavy, bored movie    but it's funny, good twisted , and lot of meaning    Why Stanley Kubrick did not get a best Director award!!??
0316056863|3.0|I don't normally read autobiographys, I do however enjoy 30 Rock (Tina's TV show) Date Night & Baby Mama (her movies) - and I thought I would give her book a try. It's very funny, I find myself laughing out loud at times - she is very honest and revealing about her life, and some parts of it are so funny I will re-read it out loud to my boyfriend so he gan get a chuckle too. I will definitely read more of her books after this.
1439153663|3.0|The story is based on an interesting pretense. A young white girl is brought into indentured servitude in the south and is a servant and privileged both. While I found it mostly enjoyable, mostly due to the characters, it doesn't always ring true. The main character always seem to do right even when it's wrong. The author portrays this same character as brave and fearful both, though more the latter so the moments of bravery seem false. This is a step above a beach book, but I wouldn't have missed if I hadn't read it. It just comes across as a bit hollow at times.

B004RSCWZ2|4.0|Yep, it's a really good album - favourites 'Midnight in Harlem' and 'Bound for Glory'. The horns seem to be buried in the mix though and Derek is also rather restrained when you compare the album versions with the live ones available on youtube where he's on blistering form. Solution: a live cd and dvd please!

B004VUP8WK|3.0|First of all I don't know when these guys will record another album..after all we waited 8 years for this new release..<br />the album starts with \\"Omni Potens\\" a kinda' sinth and horn intro reminiscent of Viking-esh' mood setting then what do you get?? a industrial track \\"TOO EXTREME!\\" a long and not too death metal-esh groove thing going on here then it get better with \\"Existo Vulgore\\" and \\"Blades for Baal\\" the best tracks classic Morbid Angel then a rock self indulgence called \\"I Am Morbid\\" kind of a sellout sounding rock type track that doesn't make any sense too me as a fan of this band then better with \\"10 More Dead\\" and we won't go into detail with that horrible \\"Destructos VS the Earth/Attack\\" and a sigh of relief with the brutal \\"Nevermore\\" and the \\"Beauty Meets Beast\\" I think was written as a ode to Mr. Vincent and the lovely miss Gen. the last two tracks are total garbage \\"Radikult\\" and \\"Profundis-Mea Culpa\\" not enough brutal tracks on this album 4 with a rock based track in my opinion..the album was recorded in 4 locations at different times the drums played by Tim Yeung were recorded by Erik Rutan at Mana Recording Studios a former member of Morbid Angel himself and also at Red Room Studios by Mark Prator..guitars/bass were recorded at D.O.W. Studios by Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez ( He recorded \\"Heretic\\" the last Morbid Angel album.) and Sean Beaven did vocal recording engineering at the Blue Room in Los Angeles California. I mention this to give the ones who thought the recording quality wasn't great.. this is food for thought. I felt this work was kind of rushed like not too much thought was compiled to make this album groundbreaking and it lacked one thing that all Trey Azagthoth fans adore...tonnes of wild guitar solos...there are a couple here and there but not enough to save this album from my disappointment.I think alone more mind blowing guitar solos or \\"Lava\\" as Trey calls it would save this album...I don't hate this album but it is not my favorite..well at least I got 3 good tracks to choose from now.<br />In closing I want to know did or didn't Trey Azagthoth mention he is \\"Willed to be instrument of this earth for the Ancient Ones??\\" to speak their tongues in both words and guitar???l at least I got 3 good tracks to choose from now.

His character development was just as good in this book as Pillars of the Earth and World Without End.  I can't seem to think of even one area where the book dragged.  That's saying something for a 1,000 page book, but par for the course when you consider Ken's previous books.<br /><br />I learned a little about that period of history and Ken did a pretty good job of not interjecting too much bias and told the story from the numerous perspectives his characters.<br /><br />Love, hate, fear, courage, political intriguing and adventure!  This book is loaded with it!<br /><br />Thanks and I am looking forward to the next book in the series.

1416562605|4.0|Winner of the 2008 Man Booker Prize<br /><br />Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger: A Novel is many things. It is a fascinating look at modern India and how it is still stuck in a sort of feudalistic state combined with the very modern world of democracy, high technology and international influences. It is also the story of corruption and how one young man rose above the masses to become an entrepreneur by using that corrupt system for himself. It is the story of how a young man who has lost his moral compass can make it through tricks, hard work and murder. Most importantly, it is very, very readable - a well-written story that pulls the reader into its world.<br /><br /> For many, this look at the third world - with its rampant corruption, absolute poverty and, sadly, a strong sentiment of \\"life is cheap\\" will come as a surprise. This is not the sanitized travelogue view of India. The characters are between cultures - they are old India and new India at the same time - and, maybe, because of that they are neither and maybe nothing at all.  It is also certainly not told from the perspective of those new members of the international economy that man the phone banks that deal with the complaints of American customers.<br /><br />Balram Halwai comes from a small rural town in India and he wants to be more than a rickshaw-puller like his father. His father was a good man but, ultimately, he died because he was too poor to stop working and too poor to get adequate medical care (or any at all thanks to corruption). A government official came to the local school and told Balram Halwai that he was the white tiger - the rarest of all creatures. In this case, he was referring to Balram Halwai's academic talents and he promised a scholarship for the boy - which promptly disappeared in the corruption of the education system. So, Balram Halwai becomes a chauffeur and eventually works for the wealthy family that practically owns and operates his tiny village like a medieval fiefdom.<br /><br />Balram Halwai uses and manipulates the system and the people in it playing by no rules at all until he ends up wanted for murder and running his own company (all of that is revealed in the first chapter so I am not writing spoilers).<br /><br />This is a harsh book. Balram Halwai is hardly a likable character and no one else is either. Everyone, including the family buffalo uses everyone around him and sucks them dry. But, this is an antidote for the reader that things that everyone lives in quaint suburban neighborhoods and drives their SUV to Super Target every weekend after soccer practice.and manipulates the system and the people in it playing by no rules at all until he ends up wanted for murder and running his own company (all of that is revealed in the first chapter so I am not writing spoilers).

B004HS1L9U|5.0|Slav Rawicz, a polish calvary officer, who fought against the Germans in western Poland when they invaded his home country, told his story to a British writer with help from his English wife who spoke three languages.  Slav returned home to his eastern home from the fighting in the West only to be \\"kidnapped\\" by the Russians for spying.  They tortured him and drugged him in order to coerce a confession out of him.  He was then sentenced and transported to Siberia by train (3000 miles) and by walking (another near 1000 miles through the snow - including fighting through three blizzards).  He escaped a few months later with five others and walked nearly 4000 miles to India (four made it) through the snow, the Gobi desert, and the Himalayas.  They went for days without food and water, lived on the land and tried to avoid contact with people.  This book is his 18 month story.  He eventually moved to the U.K., remarried and had five children.  I was unable to put this book down and read it in one day.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I like this case because it fits the phone well, it doesn't loosen over time like the silicone ones do. I like the clear color because the sleek look of my iphone4 isn't covered over. The texture on the back helps it to not slip out of my hand or out of my pocket. The front of the case has a lip, so if I set it down screen side down the screen doesn't touch the surface.     This is a well made out of durable material and does what it should.
B00540G3G6|2.0|This edition has NO NEWER features than the previous released 2D Blu ray version except for the 3D edition.  You would think that Disney would at least include the extras that were on the Laserdisc version that has yet to be relased on DVD... NOPE!  The 3D version of NBC is also CROPPED at a ration of 1:85:1 and was filmed in a resolution that is LOWER THAN the 1080P 2D version. Those that purchased the blu ray, like me, may want to pass on this unless they are just buying it because they just have to have this movie in 3D.  I've seen the 3D version of the Nightmare Before Christmas in the theaters a couple of times and as much as I LOVE NBC, I didn't think that the 3D effects enhanced it that much.  The 3D Jack in the Box at the very beginning of the film was the best 3D effect of the entire movie.  After that, the 3D effects were retrofitted and mediocre at best. If you want all the editions of this classic and didn't already purchase it in Blu Ray than go for it if your wallet will allow. However, Disney CANNOT entice me to purchase this movie a third time in 3D with NO additional features than the previous edition.

The illustrations are simply beautiful. You will find yourself staring at them for a long time, and every time you look, you'll find something new. Each page of the pop-up book also includes a story booklet. The only downfall of this book is that it is very delicate. The pop-ups are gorgeous but I advise having an older child or an adult reading this to a younger child so this book may be treasured for years to come.
B001BMKOZW|3.0|Before I go any further, I must say that I loved System of a Down's Mesmerize and Hypnotize.  They are near the top of my favorites.  Songs like \\"Revenga\\", \\"Sad Statue\\", \\"Lonely Day\\", \\"Dreaming\\", and \\"Violent Pornography\\" are right at the top of my list of favorite songs from SOAD.  The harmony between Daron Malakian and Serj Tankian set to (very) heavy metal music made for two of the best albums I've ever heard.    Having said that, I purchased this after listening to the samples of this album and samples of Tankian's \\"Elect the Dead\\" and \\"Imperfect Harmonies\\".  This album was closest to the SOAD sound.    However, it is NOT SOAD.  And I want them back together, damn it.  I want a whole band, not two halves (and Tankian's albums aren't very metal - one is just shy of being opera, which isn't bad, but I was looking for metal, thanks).  I want the old SOAD back.  This isn't exactly what I wanted, but it will do.  Tankian's albums are either mixed poorly or have little harmony in the lead vocals, which make Tankian sound hollow compared to this album (which comes close to the SOAD sound in most songs).    Note, though, that this album sounds halfway like the SOAD B-sides album.  You know, extra sounds rejected from the real album.  It's kind of depressing not hearing Tankian's nearly-crazed voice backing up Malakian's smooth punk-like voice.  However, it's a decent sound, and the metal's still there for the most part.    PUT SYSTEM OF A DOWN BACK TOGETHER!!!
B004H4XJW6|5.0|We were unable to see Megamind in the theater (my youngest son wouldn't dream of sitting still that long) so my oldest son literally jumped up and down when he saw Megamind on the counter. Both of my boys thoroughly enjoyed Megamind and neither of them moved the entire time the movie was playing. I just love when a movie captivates them like Megamind did. And the laughs.. I just love it! The following day, they watched the new action comedy Megamind: The Button of Doom with just as much attention. I just love how much action they pack into those little cartoons. Some of you may have seen Megamind: The Button of Doom on Nickelodeon recently too! My children watched it again when it aired. :)<br /><br />If you love comedy, and even if you don't have kids, you have got to see this movie. Megamind is hilarious, moving, and just outright fun. I love the star cast as well, especially Will Ferrel. He just gets me! My favorite part was when Minion was in the little pond at the end.
B0017APPT8|5.0|When it comes to films that deal with aliens, it's a general conscience that Steven Spielberg is the best, due to his work on \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\". However, Spielberg was not proven when it came to comedy. This all changed with the release of \\"Men in Black\\", for this has a mix of comedy and aliens, but more on the comedy side.    \\"Men in Black\\" is a top-secret agency that monitors the activity of extra- terrestrials mainly in Manhattan. Nobody knows of their existence. The senior agent, \\"Agent K\\" (Tommy Lee Jones) is without a partner. The MIB (Men in black) agency calls \\"the best of the best of the best\\" of the military, air force and NYPD. Agent K decides to go with the NYPD agent James Darrell Edwards (Will Smith) who is later renamed \\"Agent J\\".  In disguise of a human, a cockroach searches for a mini galaxy, but the MIB stands in his way.    With the great humor from Will Smith and the subtle humor from Tommy Lee Jones, \\"Men in Black\\" is a great comedy/alien-adventure film.
0780631684|4.0|The film basically falls apart after a terrific opening sequence. Everything leading up to the plane crash and its aftermath was amazingly well done - a mix of humor, Hitchcockian suspense and foreboding. The director even strived for poignancy and pathos - after the crash, he even included clips of the presumed search and rescue operation and showed how a real plane crash would affect survivors, from the funeral to the high school eulogies. I was impressed by how detailed this attention was to the loss of human life in what presumably is a typical teenage horror film. From this high point, however, the film degenerated and became a typical slasher film, absurd and rather silly. By the end of the film I had lost interest and it became nonsensical. What a shame - if only the end had lived up to the beginning of the film.

B0041OOJNU|4.0|I will have to call myself a diehard Shakira fan; however, her previous album, She Wolf was somewhat of a disappointment there are a couple of songs that I love, but for the most part I keep hitting skip. On the other hand, Sale El Sol is an album in which I can see her Latina roots, heritage and some of the deeper Shakira that I love, without sacrificing her English-speaking fans. I am glad that this album has a more Latino spin, because that is what makes Shakira so unique and different from the rest of the pop divas out there, I am grateful for the rendition to some of the more Caribbean-based rhythms, which take me home every time I hear them. I am giving it a four star because there is still some discordancy with the album, it does not quite flow all the way like most of her other albums, but I truly believe that this change is in the right direction.
0671004107|5.0|Ever since the film came out it has remained my favorite of all movies and I watch it more times per year than any other in my collection. There is something uplifting and I end up being deeply moved by Dr. Arroway's testimony to a Congressional investigative panel.  Her depiction of how we humans are both so small and insignificant when seen against the backdrop of the Universe, coupled as it is with how precious each and every life is....this gives me great comfort and I return to that sensibility like a warm blanket.  Curiosity finally motivated me to get the book and it was quite easy to find a very inexpensive paperback.  The book is a very quick read.  As I read it I had the movie playing in my mind, chapter by chapter and the comparisons jolted me early in the book. In fact, as is known, there are two versions: the book version and the movie version and they are in many places so different that one can almost say that they are two stories instead of one.  It reminds me of the various Leonora Overtures that Beethoven wrote for his one opera.  As I read the book I kept asking myself, why did he not stick with this or that detail in the movie version? I considered the book version translated as is to the screen as a viable story and frankly I am perplexed as to what motivated Sagan to re-write the book version so thoroughly?  Perhaps the director or the producers of the film pressured Sagan to re-work the material? In any case, the two versions are remarkably different in so many ways and if you have not seen the movie, some of my remarks here will be spoilers.  For example, Palmer Joss is depicted in the book as being covered all over his body with tatooes and does not have a romantic affair with Dr. Arroway.  Drumlin and Elie have a much closer and respectful relationship, Kitz wields much higher and very dramatic levels of power in the book and the President of the USA is a woman.  Most strange of all are the depictions of the machine which had seats for 5 people and that 3 machines were built.  These differences are only some of the many that one notices when comparing the book to the movie versions.     About the book, I have read several Sagan books and I found his writing up to the usually high standards of creativity, style, drama and erudition.  As a story I quite enjoyed it and I could not flip the pages fast enough....However, the premise of his astronomical theism as well as all SETI theology I have decided is completely insane.  I do not understand how such a smart man as Sagan and all other SETI-ites can be so foolish as to believe, deeply believe, that sentient life elsewhere in our galaxy or in another galaxy would rely on the speed of light to transmit a beacon of information, greeting, data, etc.  The distances between stars is known and is the most obvious limiting factor for two sentient civilizations to communicate with each other in a meaningful way.  Despite this fact, known and understood clearly as it was by Sagan and the SETI gang, they still clung to the notion that it would be worthwhile listening in on the universe with the random chance that they might tune into an intelligent, unnatural wavelength.  It beggars my imagination how sentient beings, stretched across the galaxies and universe, would communicate with one another if the only recourse is the speed of light.  It makes zero sense on any level. Never mind how preposterous it would be for an advanced civilization to transmit the designs of a machine that could bore through time/space, even though it might take hundreds or millions of years for that information to go one way out into the ether. The way Sagan explains the motives of the Vegan's is for me ludicrous and when he starts talking about beings who can seed galaxies, then he really has entered the science fiction hall of mirrors and well, he can write just about anything, regardless of the sense of it.     Sagan was a big believer in black holes and talked about them all the time.To this day though, they are not completely proven and even if there is circumstantial evidence of super powerful events happening around a star, there is no 'slam dunk' or 100% evidence that what is being observed is ONLY a black hole.  He, like his colleagues even today, hold fast to this and many other beliefs in what is called the standard model of astro-physics.  I have come to admire other versions of what is going on in stars and galaxies as explained by the Plasma Physics people. That Sagan toyed with the idea that the transport somehow or another involved itself with types of black holes is a predictable but silly idea that he was bound to come up with. The Einstein-Rosen bridge is a very interesting concept but alas, it still sits only as an idea that sounds more like science fiction than a reality that happens at any time in the universe on its own.  Black holes or no, tunnelling through space and time might not be a natural event.  Could it be so arranged for it to occur by artificial means, as described by Sagan as the machine?  Who knows....that part of his story I liked the most.     In summary, I really liked the book as a drama and story.  I found the premise of listening to a remote signal a foolish idea. In my mind, if an advanced civilization wanted to reach out and CONTACT us they would certainly not send us a radio signal.  They would get into their own device, (I imagine) punch a hole in space/time and come over for a visit.  That Sagan spent his whole career downplaying and making fun of and lambasting all reports of UFO sightings as false is the biggest blemish on his legacy. His short sighted and tenacious clinging to the ludicrous notion that ET's would first send us a radio signal from millions of years ago never struck him as a futile notion.  It is a foolish idea that is not based in logic.  Though I quite liked the book, the film will still remain the favored version.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|I had heard that this was a rare case of the American version being better than the European one.  It was definitely a bit gorier, and much more clear.  There were parts of the Euro version that I just did not understand and it wasn't because of the language barrier, but the subtlety of the filmmaking.  It followed the plotline very closely.  I thought the European actress was a bit more effective at looking spooky and starving and pathetic all at the same time.  Chloe Grace Moretz is a wonderful actress and has that wise/old look in her eyes, but her face is still a little bit cherubic to pull this off.  I love Richard Jenkins and felt like his character was fleshed out (pardon the pun) a bit more in the American version.    Definitely a well-made film, very moody and dark.
0307272702|5.0|When I was younger, I was able to control my weight by counting calories and running long distances. I'm no longer able to exercise as much, and had given up on controlling my weight. Then I read Taubes's NYT article, \\"Is Sugar Toxic?\\" I stopped eating sugar that day, but had questions about other carbs. Those questions were answered by this book. As I read it, I adjusted my diet to be consistent with it. I've now lost 25 pounds in less than two months and am wearing clothes I haven't fit in in years. It's not a diet; it's a revolutionary way of thinking about food. And it worked without added exercise, without calorie counting, and without hunger.<br /><br />Update, August 12, 2011: I'm now four months in and have lost 43 pounds. My stomach looks like it did when I was in high school, 30 years ago. I've had a physical, and the one lipids number that was previously bad (triglycerides) is now well within the normal range, while cholesterol levels remain in the normal range.<br /><br />In addition, I have many friends who are eating in accordance with the guidelines in this book and have lost a lot of weight. I recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight and doesn't already have a plan that works for them, or to anyone who is interested in nutrition in general.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't finished a young adult book since before I was a \\"young adult.\\" I am extremely picky about the books I read, and wasn't able to get through Harry Potter or Twilight because the quality of the writing in those books is so poor. I have to say, the Hunger Games trilogy was far better than I expected - tense, suspenseful, intricately plotted, dark, twisted, and a he** of a good time. Though these books are categorized as young adult, they are absolutely appropriate for adult readers, too.   I couldn't put these books down, especially the first and second in the series - true, they aren't great literature, but they kicked my summer reading off with a bang!
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|First off, you won't find ANY band today (short of maybe Avenged Sevenfold) that has this sound. Yes, there is more singing in this album, which I actually liked. BVB just got a new lead guitarist that does backing vocals, and he's a beast. They also got a new drummer, which explains the more complicated drumming. This album is fantastic and very unique sounding. I was blown away. Also, the album is produced better than there first, meaning the sound is more dynamic with clearly defined bass. The last album was not very good (sound) quality. Buy it.

B003Y5H54W|1.0|Just another disappointing Twilight wannabe!  This movie was a disappointment, don't waste your time. The director should look for work elsewhere!
0545265355|3.0|Short Review: The plot of this series is pretty interesting, but the actual writing is just plain awful. Just awful. The second novel, \\"Catching Fire\\" is probably the best of the three and definitely the best written (though still poorly written). The third in the series, \\"Mockingjay,\\" is the worst by all accounts. I suspect Suzanne Collins was given many millions of dollars to write the book in a month and a half. This is the shortest book of the three, but the most stuff happens in it. That's it: The interesting plot (I'm excited to see what they do with the movie version) makes for an adequate read, but the baaaaaaaaaad writing keeps this series from being anything more. (Well, it's also a great cash-machine for some people.)
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is the story of a child vampire (Chloe), her handlers/keepers, and her developing relationship with bullied 12-year old Owen. Watch the preview at: [...] It is brilliantly set in the 70s (really looked like it). This film is based on an earlier highly acclaimed Swedish film (which I have not seen). Many reviewers claim its inferiority to the original (too violent, etc.) but I found it to be a brillant roller coaster of a ride... You move along the plot line slowly then BAM, you're jumping!!! It has been some time since I watched a horror movie, and both my wife and I were transfixed by this film, its imagery, and the story. The whole thing is just plain creepy, and if that is the kind of thing you want, then see this movie.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I was not that familiar with John Mayer's music,having bought only one CD in the past, but after hearing one track from this CD, it is without a doubt one of my favorite.
B004XKMEK2|4.0|When she decided not to include \\"Louboutins\\" and \\"Fresh Out The Oven\\", I was disappointed because \\"Fresh Out The Oven\\" was the song I would constantly listen to on my ipod. After hearing the song samples, I understood why she didn't include them because the songs would have been out of place with their sounds. If she had released this like maybe 2 yrs ago, maybe they would have been included. Either way, I didn't like the fact that she decided to go with the basic, safe route just for the sake of staying relevant. It sounds no different from what I hear from the radio or Britney's Femme Fatale unfortunately. I am not too hype over this album like I did with J.LO, Rebirth, or even Brave, but I'll admit that I did enjoyed the dance tracks the most. She should have skipped the ballads and do an all dance-theme album like Britney. In my opinion, she does not have the voice to sing these type of ballads. They do not produce this special, intimate feeling. She had better ballads on On The 6, This Is Me..Then, and Brave. For some reason, I keep mistaking Brave for Love? It's probably because they are both short-titled albums and their photos look similar..not to mention some of the songs on here gave me deja vu with its lyrical line. It just make it seem like Love? is a sequel to Brave. I don't know if this is intentional or not. The only difference with the two is that Brave sounded more retro while Love? sounds more mainstream and current.<br /><br />1. On The Floor (4/5)-I'm really glad this song made J-Lo's career comeback to life and brought her back to prominence, but it's a bit overrated. Her older ones were so much better than this one. This is also the second time she did a song with Pitbull. I still prefer Fresh Out The Oven, though.<br /><br />2. Good Hit (5/5)- I like how she made a shout-out to Lucy and Miami. It's a fun, dance track to sing along to. People should note that she had also gave shout-out to cities on Gotta Be There from her Brave album.<br /><br />3. I'm Into You (5/5)- I like the nice reggae beat. As you can see, I don't think she made the right choice to release this song as a single. She should have released a followup to On The Floor to still keep people all hyped up. Some people think it's a What's My Name ripoff just because it has \\"o na na\\" as if Rihanna invented that. *rolls eyes*<br /><br />4. (What Is) Love? (5/5)- I wish she had more songs like this instead of the mushy, lovey dovey songs I keep hearing throughout the album. Honestly, this is the only song that I can actually relate to. The album title really didn't live up to its expectations. I thought there would at least be a good mixture of heartbreak and love songs.<br /><br />5. Run The World (4.5/5)-I never been a fan of Rick Ross or his music. I get tired of hearing his song \\"One Nation, Under God\\". Even though I'm not particularly fond of him, I really do like this song and I think it's single worthy.<br /><br />6. Papi (4.5/5)-I'm not too crazy about the lyrics, but I would put it on repeat.<br /><br />7. Until It Beats No More (4/5)- Her voice is definitely not that strong for this song, but I like the music and lyrics overall.<br /><br />8. One Love (2/5)-I just can't bare to listen to this song at all. I hate that annoying sound. It's sounds so generic and it's nothing but a filler. SKIP!<br /><br />9. Invading My Mind (5/5)-I LOVE this song! Yes, it may sounds too dated but I feel that it has an edge to it. It's catchy and exciting. I'm really glad she included Lady Gaga's song on this.<br /><br />10. Villain (4/5)-I'm not sure this song is good enough to be on this album. It's one of those songs that kinda grows on you. I feel that maybe it should have been left as a bonus track.<br /><br />11. Starting Over (4/5)-once again, her voice fails to deliver but the lyrics flow well.<br /><br />12. Hypnotico (5/5)-BEST song on the album!!! it totally grabs my attention and that's what I needed. She should have released this as her second single instead! It would have been great for summer! Someone should tell her this!<br /><br />13. Charge Me Up (4/5)-I got bored easily...it sounds so completely basic and it doesn't sound that much fun as Invading My Mind. they should have twisted it up some more.<br /><br />14. Everybody's Girl (3.5/5)-it kinda reminds me of Madonna's Hollywood, but the song itself just wasn't that interesting enough to make me wanna put it on repeat.<br /><br />15. Take Care (3.5/5)-I would have gave it a higher rating if she didn't plastered the song with these cheesy, puppy love lyrics.<br /><br />16. Ven A Bailar (5/5)-I think the spanish version sounded more sexier than the english version.<br /><br />average rating: 4.31nd single instead! It would have been great for summer! Someone should tell her this!<br /><br />13. Charge Me Up (4/5)-I got bored easily...it sounds so completely basic and it doesn't sound that much fun as Invading My Mind. they should have twisted it up some more.<br /><br />14.

B004X8W4A4|4.0|If you love the show Castle, then you have to own the books as well.  This one was even better than the first.  The characters are from the show as well as the first book and both books are marketed as being actually written by Richard Castle.  I could picture the characters nuances and inflections as I was reading, i.e. read the part of Nikki Heat with Stana Katic's voice, and of course Jameson Rook with Nathan Fillion's voice, etc.  Loved it!!

0670022411|2.0|However, Eric Northman is your VILF, don't even bother with this one.  This book had so much potential with the mixing of science, magic, and academia.  However, the dull romance sinks it.  I still have no idea what Matthew sees in the very beige Diana, aside from the usual cliche of her amazing scent and random glowy-ness.      I was very hopeful that since the plot is different than the usual paranormal fare that the romance would be different, too.  Matthew's introduction is mysterious and intriguing, and he starts out as a very appealing character.  Yet it takes all of a couple chapters for that seductive danger to fizzle, and we're back to the standard Twilight Non-Threatening Male Syndrome.  No excitement, no witty exchanges, no sparks, nothing to SHOW any kind of chemistry, aside from being TOLD that there is. In fact, the dialogue between them becomes so saccharine at certain points, it just hurts to read it. I found myself flipping through the romance scenes just to get to more science/magic.  The blandness of their relationship distracts so much from the enjoyment of reading it, that even the truly interesting sections on science and magic can't keep the plot momentum going.

B000000H42|5.0|Melissa was a fantastic underground metal album and a super-stylish debut for Mercyful Fate. But Oath is bloody godhead! This time around the arrangements are tighter and the whole affair comes off as much more focused and menacing. Guitarists Michael Denner and Hank Sherman weave a wicked sonic tapestry of gothic riffs and harmonies, which are occasionally enhanced by some truly eerie keyboard parts. The superb rhythm section (Kim Ruzz on drums, Timi Hansen on bass), meanwhile, execute dozens of meticulous rhythms and time changes on a dime. And King Diamond is at his theatrical best, conjuring demons, lost souls and black magic with his ghostly symphony of voices. One of the best albums and bands of 1980s metal.
B00006GO9Q|2.0|The other reviewers' evocation of ambient music is very apt.  But jazz can be more challenging than that.  How could someone who had done more interesting work with Parker and Coltrane fall into this mind-numbing mood music? The blandness is depressing: endless decorative noodlings in keyboards; the bass hardly moves for 15 minutes at a time, pinned to a repetitive two-note figure; even Miles' own solos seem wan and tame, compared with earlier work.  The way is paved for the proto-New Age ECM Muzak-jazz of the 1970s.  If you like your jazz challenging, with truly independent lines (real polyphony), adventurous dissonances and rhythmic energy, this is not for you.  At best it is a period document of how jazz could get sucked into airport music harmlessness.  This CD makes one wonder if one problem with Miles was not, all along, too much concern with \\"style\\" and \\"cool\\" (outer attitude, \\"good taste\\") rather than musical argument?  Coltrane, Ornette, Dolphy, Ayler, Cecil Taylor, Braxton and others never let mere surface \\"style\\" or interior-decorator's \\"tastefulness\\" get in the way of pushing their musical thought to its limits... too bad, for someone so talented.
B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax have other great albums but nowhere is their vision better realized than on their deadly third album Among the Living. Classics like \\"Caught In a Mosh,\\" \\"I Am the Law\\" and \\"Imitation of Life\\" are delivered with breakneck velocities and a clear, in-your-face production (courtesy of Eddie Kramer).<br /><br />Anthrax's comic book sense of humor and overall sense of Noo Yawk-ness set them apart from their death-obsessed West Coast thrash contemporaries. But the band also display a refreshing social consciousness that was fairly unique for a band playing this kind of music. During the course of Among the Living, Anthrax take aim at drug addiction, violence and the plight of the American Indian, among other things. If you're looking for the usual \\"sex, drugs and rock n' roll\\" routine, look elsewhere.<br /><br />Oh, and in case you were wondering, this is where the now-ubiquitous expression \\"NOT!\\" was born. Seriously!
B003UESJ9M|4.0|I'm not a big Gwenyth Paltrow fan and have to be honest her story wasn't moving me.  But I think the characters of Beau and Chiles stole the movie for me.  Maybe they weren't supposed to with Gwenyth as lead but I found myself forwarding most of her parts and looking forward to the young love and self discovery of the younger characters in the movie.    My favorite part was anytime they sang a duet together.  I didn't much care for the pimping of look Gwyneth Paltrow can sing.
B000000H4A|5.0|After making two game-changing albums with Mercyful Fate, lead singer King Diamond stole their bassist and one of their guitarists (Timi Hansen and Michael Denner, respectively) and split for a solo career, intent on showing the world the true breadth of his songwriting skills.<br /><br />His first album, Fatal Portrait, is a resounding success. For one thing, it is incredibly impressive to find Mr. Diamond writing not only the lyrics this time around, but nearly all of the music -- challenging and intricate, yet expertly-crafted as it is -- as well. Lyrically, Portrait finds the former Kim Bendix Petersen dabbling tentatively with conceptual elements, using a loose storyline to connect all the songs in the album's first half (and the disc's final track) in a macabre tale of demon possession. It is fun stuff. The overt satanism of Mercyful Fate is toned down noticeably here; listening to Fatal Portrait is more like watching a good Hammer horror flick than hearing a manifesto from Anton LaVey.<br /><br />Musically, the album kicks ass; new recruit Andy LaRocque adds a more high-tech sort of guitar flash to Denner's relatively restrained melodicism and the pairing works swell. Diamond also picked a winner in super-capable drummer Mikkey Dee, whose muscular playing drives the music with total command.<br /><br />In discussions of the King Diamond catalog, Fatal Portrait often gets short shrift. But in many ways, it is his freshest and most succinct album. It carries over just enough menacing metal crunch from his former band (\\"Charon\\", \\"Lurking In the Dark\\") and combines it with lush gothic auras (\\"The Candle\\", \\"Haunted\\") in a most effective fashion. And it's nice not having to follow a story line through an entire long-player.

B000002L61|4.0|Dio's second album Last in Line was a lil' glossier than their bullet-proof debut, Holy Diver, and featured the awful wannabe pop single \\"Mystery\\" but it's pretty damned good overall. If the album-opening \\"We Rock\\" doesn't hit quite as hard as Holy Diver's \\"Stand Up and Shout,\\" it certainly has its own majestic rush, not to mention a nice sentiment of inclusiveness. We rock! You can't go wrong with that. Elsewhere, the soaring title track, with its soft/loud suckerpunch opening, and the sensual \\"One Night in the City\\" certainly stand among Dio's finest songs.<br /><br />Some of Last in Line borders on what critics would call \\"by-the-numbers craftsmanship\\" (songs like \\"Breathless\\" and \\"Evil Eyes\\" are the kind of tunes Dio can write in his sleep) but hell, it all sounds so good you hardly care.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I love these earphones....they are so comfortable and I listen to books while I walk.  But they don't last very long...  then again, they are inexpensive.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|One of the greatest metal acts ever, underrated Teutonic headbangers Accept were pioneers in thrash (check out \\"Breaker\\" and \\"Fast As a Shark\\") and possessed an unparalleled knack for muscular, melodic metal. There's no mistaking the glorious shriek of lead singer/goblin Udo Dirkshneider, and guitarists Wolf Hoffman and Jorg Fischer always played with a melodic tastefulness and imagination you don't see that often in metal. The rhythm section forged tight, economical grooves that created both power and space.<br /><br />If you could only buy one Accept record, it oughta be 1984's legendary, notorious Balls to the Wall, which boasts not only the marching, anthemic title track (of which the mighty Ronnie James Dio himself said \\"I wish I'd written it!\\") but plenty of other undisputed classics like \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Love Child,\\" whose pummeling guitar crunch is counterbalanced by undeniable catchiness.<br /><br />Interestingly, many of the lyrics on Balls to the Wall deal with squirmy themes of sexual confusion and blatant, overheated homoeroticism. For a metal band, this is especially ballsy, pardon the pun. The heavy metal community has always been hopelessly macho and not known for its tolerance. And remember, this is a full decade before Rob Halford came out of the closet! If you ask me, it makes Accept even cooler.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games stands today as, in my opinion, a modern classic.  While many draw parallels between this and other works of dystopian futures where the young are killed for sport (i. E. Battle Royale and The Long Walk), The Hunger Games has something more.  The writing style is easy to follow and keeps the reader's attention.  The main characters are interesting and well developed.  The setting and plot of the novel are well described and easy to follow.  What really sets The Hunger Games (and its sequels) apart from similar works is its completeness.  Battle Royale and The Long Walk were great stories, but they were limited to the impact of the game featured in the story.  The Hunger Games trilogy deals with more than just the game.
B004X904JQ|5.0|The long awaited return of the legend Morbid Angel finally is upon us.  I have wondered if this legend would ever make a come back and finally they did. Now if you liked the raw sound of the older Morbid Angel you might sneer at this one. It is a big step up for this band after what ten years. They threw some different sounds and the production was certainly top notch this time. I think this a great album whether you like the new sound or not. I see some critical reviews on here mostly dogging them for not coming back with same thing they left with. Its been 10 years cant expect repeats of what you liked then. I like bands they dont keep repeating the same thing every time. It shows they are growing and maturing in my book. As with this would it have been any good if it sounded like Domination again. No it would have been a waste cause you already have that. I'm a fan of Morbid Angel and if this album stunk I'd be the first to say so. I've criticized other bands I like for a bad cd. This is a great cd I'd advise buying this long awaited comeback of a legend in metal.

0679805273|5.0|...about this awesome book.  Others have given enough details, but I just want to add that I and my kids, ages 2-6 (I have an in-home childcare), enjoy this book.  We talk about being able to do anything you can dream of if you work hard, but that some things take more work than others.  We talk about making mistakes and struggling (like riding a bike), but that you can get there eventually.  I give this as a present to all of my children when they \\"graduate\\" preschool and leave for kindergarten; it's perfect and you can never go wrong with Dr. Seuss!

Not sure she understood the lack of colors (most pages are blue and white like the cover)  She was 10 mos when I started reading it to her.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed this product because I had purchased a new Dell XPS Dell tower to replace the previous one which had died. The previous tower had been connected via a COM port to my Uninterrupted Power Supply by Conext. The new tower had only USB connections. Dell had told me that I would have to purchase a new UPS(!). I doubted that and went online to search. I chose this product because it had an installation disc and because it said that the installation process would make it possible for me to use any of the USB ports rather than have to install the software for a particular port. It worked as advertized and saved me having to purchase a new UPS.
B004K8WPUQ|1.0|I watched videos online for reviews and to hear the quality myself. It sounded great. Its size was perfect for my small dslr bag. When this microphone arrived I tested it with all variable settings in mic and at every in-camera volume. No matter what the configuration was, a very annoying and painfully noticeable hiss was present. This immediately eliminates its potential for professional use. And for that matter any use at all. This was a waste of my time and money. I think its likely I just got a bad copy of the mic, as recordings I've heard online sound great compared to my experience. You may be better off purchasing in store after testing it before purchasing to ensure your copy is not bad.
1416955070|1.0|After seeing this book favorably compared to Hunger Games and Twilight on numerous reviews, I broke down and paid the $10 Kindle charge to download it. I wish this were one of those movies where if you leave the theater, you can ask to get a refund. I read this book to the very bitter end, hoping for something to happen which would make it all worth my time. In for a 999 pennies, out for a pound I supppose.  2 key story lines were a direct rip off from Star Wars (Luke, I am your fahhhhthaaa), and the rest a slow moving, often silly tale. It starts off with a moderately interesting premise: Clary, the heroine, is the only person in a packed teen club who can see a murder taking place, as to everyone else they are seemingly invisible. She soon learns that these killers are part of a group who hunts and kills demons. Soon after, Clary's mother is kidnapped or murdered and Clary finds herself thrown together with the very same demon hunters she'd seen the night before.  What follows is an implausible mix of werewolves, vampires, demons, monsters, telepathic freaks, warlocks, and a midnight spin on flying demon-cycle.   I honestly have no idea what in this book appealed to so many! Further, I think this book gives YA lit a bad name.  There are so many great books out there that deserve our attention. Try Poison Study, or Graceling instead.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have downloaded and installed this full version key on my xoom wifi without any issues. Most issues regarding activation seem to be installing the reader from android market and the full version key from the amazon market. Both have to be from the amazon market for correct registration and activation. There seemed to be an activation issue with the xoom wifi particularly but that seems to have been solved. Now regarding the software itself. Pros : I downloaded quickoffice pro HD from market and tried opening a few excel files I have on my device. Many of them did not open. so since I was within the 15 min money back period I uninstalled it without issues. I was a bit surprised by this cause the same files were opening in the quick office reader that came preinstalled on the device. I guess editing is a bit different engine than simple reading. Now the same files are opening without problem in the documents to go editor. So although quick office interface is much better than documents to go it was useless for me particularly regarding opening my excel files. It supports many excel functions and I have had to make only a few modifications in the function for seamless synchronization. PowerPoint allows basic editing and I don't really see myself using this much except for viewing presentations maybe. Word with its intact technology does appear to render word files just as they would appear on the desktop. There is a useful word count function in the editor but I don't think this should be used with any word file with more than 50 pages maybe, as just the 3-4 page test acme word file that came along with the program took around 20-30 seconds to count all words, so this feature seems to take a lot out of the device. Cons : Word does not support insertion of pictures. This could be a deal breaker for many as quickoffice pro HD does have this facility. Another thing I have observed is that support is a bit doggy with the dataviz team. many of the support links in their forums are dead or simply lead to the main page of dataviz website. I had a query regarding feature addition in documents to go, so I sent them an email. I received a reply with a link where I was supposed to submit feature requests. the funny bit is that even this link does not work. So the only realistic support is email which takes around 3-4 days. I hope that I don't have any major issues with the software so that I don't need to contact them but this can be a real big deal. I am not taking away any stars from my rating as this package is working wonderfully well for me currently and hope it stays this way.

But thats my opinion.  Come on Joe quit being so commercialized
B004I8WD6E|4.0|If your not a fashionista but instead are looking for a good value in a case that offers basic protection for your iPhone then look no further.  This case is not ugly but it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of looks.  What it does offer is basic protection against drops.  I've dropped it twice on a thin carpet covered concrete floor without any damage to my iPhone.  And that is really all you should expect for in a sub-$10 case.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|A lovely album hearkening back to Spaghetti Western soundtracks of the 1960s (particularly those of Ennio Morricone) - the album also features modern touches like vocalists Jack White of the White Stripes.  Moody and atmospheric, it's great background music for a quiet day hiding from the rain, or a more mellow party.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|Back when I was growing up there was a young filmmaker known for great movies like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial. These were wonderful movies. The first was scary, the second was thought-provoking and the third was excellent family entertainment. As the 1980s came along, this filmmaker, Steven Spielberg, made other fine works, like the Indiana Jones series and in the 1990s gave us Jurassic Park. Then he discovered World War II, and that was basically then end of him making \\"genre\\" films that appealed to a wide audience.    But apparently I wasn't the only one who had fond memories of Spielberg's earlier career. JJ Abrams, noted as the man who made Lost and directed the Star Trek reboot, seems to also have those sorts of good memories. So he teamed up with Spielberg and made Super 8, a film which, aside from the modern special effects, would not seem out of place in Spielberg's resume.    Super 8 centers around events in small-town Ohio in 1979. Joe Lamb is a young boy whose mother has died at the start of the film. Four months later he and his friends are making a zombie movie when they inadvertently bear witness to a massive (and extremelyunrealistic), train derailment. They escape with their lives, unaware that something else has escaped, too. Soon all the town's dogs disappear, only to turn up in nearby towns. The Air Force arrives to clean up the train mess and begins basically overtaking the town (and get away with massive lies, because if there's one thing we know about the 1970s, it's that investigative journalism didn't really exist and trust in the government was absolute). Then various items and people start to disappear and the action gets ramped-up to eleven, leading to an unnecessarily action-heavy third act.    At its core this is a movie about the relationship between a young boy, his friends and a girl that he's starting to develop a crush on. The movie is at its finest when it shows these kids just being kids. When it shows them hanging out chatting in a diner and teasing each other like kids do. When it shows them sneaking out of their homes to film at night. When it shows them being appalled/overjoyed that they're actually breaking into their school during summer vacation. These moments, as well as the ones highlighting Joe's somewhat complicated relationship with his father, also the town deputy and person in charge after the sherrif disappears), are the true heart of the film.    Those moments also make the moments of action, which include the military going nuts in the middle of the town, completely unnecessary. Those scenes add nothing to the plot, really, aside from creating some artificial peril for our heroes to deal with. Really one could edit out all the military elements and be left with a good, solid, summer science fiction film for the whole family. Also, having gone nuts with the action sequence, I feel that Abrams missed a really opportunity to kill off one of the kids. Harsh? Maybe, but it might have added something to the film. But consider the one of the pivotal moments of Jaws is when a six-year-old boy is gruesomely eaten by the shark.    I also need to make mention of Abrams as a director. He's good at what he does. He's very good at what he does. But he's never met a lens flare he didn't like, and frankly it's really, really distracting. If you thought scenes in Star Trek overused the lens flare, just you wait. Abrams really goes nuts with it in this movie and it does not add anything to the film.    Ultimately this is a very good movie, and I'd said it's suitable for pretty much the entire family.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Such a fun game, but has less blades than the iOS version, and the last three open feint achivements aren't unlockable for some reason.
B002ZG993Q|4.0|It takes a while for things to start happening but meanwhile the Italian scenery is undeniably beautiful.  I got a little impatient in the beginning of the movie but soon found it quietly turning up the tension.  Truly the cinematography of the Italian countryside is nothing short of gorgeous.  At the same time you've got this hitman's paranoia vs the desire for intimacy that makes you care whether he lives or dies.  All in all, and whether you find it worth watching or not, you know you are in the presence of quality, quiet and understated.  If you can make it past the slow beginning I think you'll find it develops into something tense indeed.  Clooney puts in a pretty good performance, though I can understand why many wouldn't care for it's noirish ending, which makes its point but perhaps doesn't end on what many might consider a satisfying note.
B004UA8D1O|3.0|I would recommend this movie for anybody who has entered and explored caves.<br />Caves are wonderfull and creepy...there is no sound from the outside when you<br />are inside, the views are unique, crawling from tunnel to crack to whatever is<br />freaky and after a while, you cant wait to be back out of the cave. But as soon<br />as you are out...you want to go back in...i know its crazy... but i had to mention<br />it as it makes this simple film into a good film.  You can feel and sense the<br />situation the actors/actresses are in...its real cool.
B004V6MWFU|1.0|Wow this album sucks.  The music sucks and the songs suck.  My 5 year old daughter can play better ukulele than this.  Also what is it with Eddie Vedder singing totally off?  Can't he take singing lessons.  This album is terrible.

0061537969|5.0|This book is written from a dog's point of view...a very intelligent dog. I could see my dogs in this book and laughed.  There is also a story about a young man waiting for his big break to be a professional race car driver, his young family and 1 traumatic event that leads to a second traumatic event (that was the crying part)  It is also a story of the real,loving relationship between dogs and humans; but as important a story of personal strength and determination.<br />A must read for everyone.
B000TCEU4Q|4.0|I've had this product for about a week now. I love it. It definitly kicks the realism up a notch. The only problem is that the product itself seems like it could break easily if misused or dropped. It's pretty expensive and I thought that the plastic would be a little more durable. Other then that I've had no problem with the product. It's a great one and I can't wait until I the Saitek Pro flight Yoke gets here! I just ordered it like 10 min. ago.
0345529057|5.0|Just received the boxed set yesterday! Already a quarter of the way through book I. I've been watching the series on HBO and when I saw what a great deal the boxed set was, I just had to have it. I've been a Kindle addict and this is my first real book purchase in over a year! The Kindle edition was more expensive so I decided to give real books another chance. Great set of books! I went through them all and found none of the errors some of the other reviewers mentioned. The series on HBO follows the books pretty closely. If you're on the fence about making this purchase, jump. It's a good buy! Not to worry Amazon, I'm still a Kindle addict.

0307272702|5.0|I read this book because 2 of my friends had already read it and have been following its advice on how to lose weight for the last 5 months. In that time, they have both lost over 50 pounds, so I was extremely curious. Taubes does a great job explaining the endocrinology underlying weight gain. There isn't really much that's new about what he recommends, but he explains the science behind the recommendations so clearly and persuasively that I was hooked. As someone who cares about science and is often perturbed by poorly designed medical and epidemiological studies of \\"risk factors\\" for health and social problems, I was especially interested in the history he outlines behind the nutritional guidelines we've been given in America over the last 40 years, during the time that obesity levels have increased by orders of magnitude. He makes a very convincing case for a low-carb diet and its many health benefits, not limited to weight loss. I have now been following his guidelines for almost 3 weeks and have already lost 5 pounds, without changing my level of exercise, and without starving myself (Taubes explains why neither exercise nor starvation ever have been shown to produce lasting, meaningful levels of weight loss, by the way). This pattern stands in contrast to my utter failure to lose any weight over the previous 6 months, despite watching my calories and adding exercise back into my life. I'm now needing to go shopping for new clothes, as my pants are getting too loose. That's the major downside to this approach that he never discusses in the book, so buyer beware!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't review books, but I couldn't let this one go without adding my 5 stars as well.  I haven't been this utterly satisfied by a book in a long time.  Fantastic emotional connections, unique story line and an ending to the book that brings perfect closure. <3

0393316041|4.0|I honestly had never heard of Richard Feynman until I read Grand Design by Steven Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. I Google'd him and discovered a real character with many fans, so I became intrigued and ordered Surely You're Joking.    Initialy the guy comes across as a real geek but actually there is very little science in the book and so is for the most part is a very easy read. As each chapter is in approximate chronological order you get to know him and his escapades from a young boy until sometime after he receives the Nobel prize.    Apparently he would start every lecture by asking, \\"Any questions?\\" and he applied his thirst for knowledge, experimentation and understanding not only to his chosen field, Theortical Phyisics, but to his whole life too.     You learn to understand about his very logical thought process and inventiveness which gets him into all sorts interesting situations. From fixing radio's to college tricks, picking locks, picking up women, samba drumming, art and of course making nuclear bombs, every anecdote will make you smile and look forward the next one, the pages fly by!

0345529057|1.0|The whole series is amazing, for that alone it should get 5 stars. However, this box set contains several printing errors. The fourth book in my box set is missing pages, and has one page duplicated. Based on the other reviews I've read, I'm not only not the first person this has happened to, I also got off pretty easy compared to what others' errors were. The printing errors aren't even the same for all people, which means that at some point they tried to fix it and only made it worse. The publisher should never have let something like this happpen.
0860074382|1.0|I saw the movie, and while I didn't love it, it was interesting enough for me to try the book. Big mistake. It's like peeking at the diary of a cloying, annoying, lonely woman. At times I felt sorry for her, but mostly just angry at myself for spending the money to get the book.  The only amazing thing about this book, is how many people love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I beleive that was a really good book that i couldnt put down and was definately the best in the series
0143036424|5.0|A Review of the Entire Series:<br /><br />I became interested in knowing more about the Walt Longmire Mysteries after learning that it was going to be made into a TNT series starring Katee Sackhoff, who was in one of my all-time favorite series, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  So I picked up THE COLD DISH and then DEATH WITHOUT COMPANY and then KINDNESS GOES UNPUNISHED and so on through ANOTHER MAN'S MOCASSINS, A DARK HORSE, JUNKYARD DOGS, and on to Craig Johnson's latest offering to the series, HELL IS EMPTY.<br /><br />I can't express how impressed I am with this series of novels.  There are a couple of things to point out.<br /><br />First, none of these books are written by a formula.  About the only thing each novel has in common with the others is that Walt Longmire, the sheriff of Absaroka County, gets battered and beaten in each one.  The one ongoing joke, for lack of a better word, in each book is how much physical punishment Walt undergoes. But the novels themselves differ starkly from one to another.  Most series reenact the same novel again and again, with only minor alterations from one book to the next.  But Craig Johnson clearly refuses to take the easy path, but insists on working hard to create something new each time.<br /><br />Second, these books are driven by character and are not whodunits.  There are mysteries to be solved, but these are not the heart of each book.  Most of the novels focus on a series of character portraits of an ensemble cast, but his most recent novel, HELL IS EMPTY focuses on just a couple of characters. But for the most part the books focus on the ensemble.  Walt is always front and center because he is the narrator, but we come to know most of the major characters nearly as well, including Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, Walt's deputy; his best friend Henry aka \\"The Cheyenne Nation\\"; Walt's daughter Cady, the dispatcher Ruby, and many others. The large group of eccentrics making up Walt's world actually reminds me of the town of Cecily, Alaska in NORTHERN EXPOSURE more than it does any other detective or mystery series.<br /><br />There are a number of other things I really like about the books.  I love the literary references.  Walt attended USC on a football scholarship, where he was an offensive lineman and majored in Literature (he would have graduated a year before O.J. Simpson arrived and therefore he never blocked for him), and he retains a prodigious knowledge of English language poetry. I'm not a gun guy, but he brings guns into the story in a way that is more fun than usual in such discussions. And you have to love Walt's gentle nature and its contrast with Vic's unrestrained profanity.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the books is the rather stereotyped Indian mysticism. Walt gets visions or prophetic dreams on a regular basis and I generally could have done without all of this. Well, with one exception.  I did rather enjoy Virgil in HELL IS EMPTY, his latest book.  To give as few spoilers as possible, the book relies heavily on themes and images from Dante's INFERNO, and so it is appropriate that Walt should have a Virgil as his guide, even if Walt himself is well beyond the middle stage of life.<br /><br />I can't recommend these books strongly enough.  I would also strongly recommend reading them in order.  That order would be (year of original publication noted - though the books themselves take place in the space of only a year or two):<br /><br />Cold Dish (2004)<br />Death Without Company (2006)<br />Kindness Goes Unpunished (2007)<br />Another Man's Moccasins (2008)<br />The Dark Horse (2009)<br />Junkyard Dogs (2010)<br />Hell is Empty (2011)<br /><br />I started off reading these just because of the upcoming television series, but now I love them only for their own sake.ore than it does any other detective or mystery series.

So rather than write my own review of Tina Fey's newest tome, I have decided to allow Tina to write her own review using words I found at random by flipping through the book. Here goes....<br /><br />\\"As I renovate a house, the Monsignor Bonner football team met. One day I went into a room full of vending machines. This really is the craziest thing Thomas Jefferson.\\"<br /><br />Ok, that didn't really work.

0307887960|2.0|As a book, The Dukan Diet is laid out in an easy-to-follow manner.  A quick read that details the diet and the reasons for staying on each stage for a certain amount of time.  That said, as a diet, this fails miserably unless you have only 5-10 pounds to lose. Even then, increasing exercise (as Dukan recommends) is likely to give one the same results.  If one has more than 10 pounds to lose, this diet will get old VERY fast.  Journaling your calorie intake, increasing your exercise, and using good common sense is likely to garner better results.  I can't recommend this as a good weight loss plan or a lifetime eating style.
B002ZG983M|3.0|The show's different from the Marvel action hero genre, a fresh angle in fighting crime.  Initially the plot appeared humorous - the idea of more vigilantes standing up against societal crime.    But what is disturbing about the show is/are: (a) Having a teenage boy with no special ability who exposes himself to gang violence, and always getting injured.  That's illogical (b) Having an eleven year girl being trained to kill thugs with a smile on her face.  That's disturbing.    Some might argue that either scenario is fine as long as the villains are punished, but I think tarnishing the youths' lives to do so is just thoughtless.  I would prefer adults being substituted for the plot - at least they know what they're getting themsleves into...

0156711427|3.0|I enjoyed this book, as I had enjoyed the mini-series 20+ years ago.  The twists and turns of the plot are carried off with aplomb, the characterizations are sharp (I guess -- there aren't any people today like the characters in this book, for a variety of reasons), and the dialogue is well-crafted.  In the end, alas, it's a whole lot of fuss and bother about ... about what? It's never made completely clear.  The fact that Forster was gay, and had to repress it, screams from every page; one just wants to reach in there and pull him into the 21st century somehow.  It is abundantly clear that the relationship of Dr. Aziz and his friend the school superintendent is the only one about which Forster really cares -- and yet since this is after all a Victorian novel, Forster has to equip Aziz with a dead wife and a taste for Calcutta rent-a-ladys -- has to make him hetero, in other words. Everyone says, \\"This is a novel about sexual repression,\\" and that can't be disputed; however, it's not first-rank stuff, and Forster himself knew that. At times things just sort of lumber along, and the machinery is visible.  Still, if you're interested in India or planning a trip there, this is an excellent way of finding some things out about the country's history.  Forster fouls his own nest -- he hates the English -- and if that sort of thing doesn't bother you, you'll be just fine with \\"Passage to India.\\"

The photographs of various confections are absolutely gorgeous and many step by step, technique teaching photos are included such as piping and assembling macarons and filling cakes with buttercream and covering with fondant. Not only is this book too beautiful to keep on a shelf or in a cupboard, but it is extremely useful as well. A treat for the eyes, mind and sweet tooth at your leisure.

B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Unknown (drama, mystery, thriller)<br />Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra<br />Starring Liam Neeson, Diane Kruger and January Jones<br /><br />Warner Bros.   2011   113 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jun 21, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Portuguese: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy (with digital copy)<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Unknown's plot is extremely simple once you know a key piece of information, but that's not revealed until late in the movie. As a result, you'll find yourself confused and having to guess what's really going on. On first viewing, Unknown is full of mystery and puts the viewer in the position of the main protagonist, Martin Harris (Neeson). Like Memento, the story keeps letting us see events in a new context and their meaning changes as a result.<br /><br />Harris flies into Berlin with wife Liz (Jones) for a biotechnology conference. He's one of the speakers. While getting into a taxi at the airport, he leaves behind a briefcase containing his passport and vital documents. Does that seem like the act of a man with the supposed intelligence of Harris? He notices that it's missing when they arrive at the hotel and jumps into another taxi while his wife checks in. There's no signal for his phone (really) so he can't explain his actions.<br /><br />The taxi is involved in an accident and plunges into a river. The driver, Gina (Kruger), pulls him out and then runs off leaving him in the hands of the medics. He wakes up in hospital and all he can remember is his name and that he's married to Liz, who doesn't know where he is. The doctor tells him that he's been in a coma for four days.<br /><br />Luckily, he sees a story about the conference on TV in his room and remembers that he's supposed to be attending. It shows the hotel where he was supposed to check in. How convenient. After checking out and going to the hotel, he sees his wife at a reception. The problem is she says that she doesn't know him. She even introduces another man as her husband, Martin Harris. The hotel security men throw him out. Are you confused yet? Is he really Martin Harris? Is everything we are seeing just some coma-induced dream? Is he crazy?<br /><br />The story continues with Harris trying to prove his identity. He finds Gina and she agrees to help him. He also phones a friend in the US who he knows can confirm his identity. His memories slowly start to return and he notes everything he can remember. One piece of information tells him that he has a meeting arranged with Professor Bressler, who he communicated with by phone and email for a while. Maybe Bressler can confirm his identity? It wouldn't explain his wife's actions, but it would be a start.<br /><br />I won't reveal any more of the story because it would ruin the mystery, but it contains a few glaring plot holes. The exposition is also laughable at times and assumes that the audience is pretty dumb. My favorite example is: \\"So that's got all your secrets in it, right?\\"<br /><br />You might be wondering why I gave the movie such a high score if it's full of so many plot holes and stupid dialogue. The reason is it somehow works. Neeson is such a good actor that he pulls it off. I found myself actually caring about his predicament and wanting to see him resolve it. Most of the supporting cast does a great job too and I was especially impressed with Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.<br /><br />Did you see the movie posters advertising the theatrical run? It showed Neeson holding a gun and looking ready to take on the world. In short, it was marketed as Taken 2. If you buy the movie on the strength of that image, you may be disappointed. Neeson doesn't touch a gun at any point in the movie. There are a couple of car chases and scenes full of action, but this is nothing like Taken. Neeson does get into a couple of fights, but this is more a mystery than an action movie. Fans of Taken might like Neeson enough to enjoy this too, but be aware that the two movies are very different.<br /><br />I found myself invested in the story, even though I could see that parts of it were contrived or even ludicrous. Neeson plays it dead straight and is believable in his role. Kruger did a good job as his sidekick. I've watched the movie twice now and will be happy to watch it again despite its flaws.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />I have no complaints about the picture quality. Fine grain is present throughout and detail is always strong. I detected one slightly noisy image in a dark scene, but that's a minor quibble. Colors look accurate and the presentation is clean and bright. You'll be very happy when you see it.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The movie starts quietly, but gradually increases in volume as the action rises. Dialogue is always clear, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track really starts to shine when we see the car crash.

For action fans, it could fail to meet expectations. The Blu-ray presentation certainly won't disappoint, but there's very little in the way of special features.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5is more a mystery than an action movie. Fans of Taken might like Neeson enough to enjoy this too, but be aware that the two movies are very different.    I found myself invested in the story, even though I could see that parts of it were contrived or even ludicrous. Neeson plays it dead straight and is believable in his role. Kruger did a good job as his sidekick. I've watched the movie twice now and will be happy to watch it again despite its flaws.    Video Quality 4.5/5  I have no complaints about the picture quality. Fine grain is present throughout and detail is always strong. I detected one slightly noisy image in a dark scene, but that's a minor quibble. Colors look accurate and the presentation is clean and bright. You'll be very happy when you see it.    Audio Quality 5/5  The movie starts quietly, but gradually increases in volume as the action rises. Dialogue is always clear, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track really starts to shine when we see the car crash. The action scenes in the final act all benefit from heavy use of the surrounds and you'll feel like you're in the middle of the action. The audio presentation is flawless.

B004A8ZWSS|1.0|I could review this movie in one word..... BORING!  Not even worth watching for Angelina Jolie.  My wife and I BOTH fell asleep.  It's about as exciting as watching the grass grow.
0375830995|2.0|I want to find Markus Zusak and shake him, shouting: \\"Why for the love of all things good did you go and do a thing like that?!\\".  This book is ok.  I didn't find it particularly readable, nor plausible, nor clever.  In fact, I felt embarrassed when reading it on the tube, in case someone read over my shoulder and thought I actually liked teen fiction.  Don't bother, I wish I hadn't.  If, however, for some silly reason you haven't read The Book Thief yet: Buy. It. Now.  (Did you see what I did there, did ya, did ya?!).

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Plants vs. Zombies is an addictive, entertaining game of tower defense where you use dozens of different plants with abilities of their own to defend against the incoming zombies. But probably the most enjoyable feature for my is the almanac where you can enjoy some great writing for the descriptions of every zombie and plant type. However, after a couple weeks of playing the game just won't start anymore with an error message that only says \\"Unauthorized Request: The request was unauthorized.\\"<br /><br />The game is great, but not being able to play it really detracts from the overall experience.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I received the G13 yesterday. It took me about 2 hours to get WOW to accept my own profile rather than the default.  This was probably my fault as I was unable to understand the help files.  After a google I got it to work.  It was well worth the frustration and effort.  My game play improved a lot and my wrist doesn't bother me anymore.  I won't explain further as the other reviews tell it all.  This is the one to buy.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I've had a number of cases for my iPhone 4 so far and this is by far my favorite. I always thought I liked the soft rubber cases better but after using this case I have to say that this is much more convenient. The surface of the case retains the hard feel of the iPhone itself which is really nice, and it also makes it very easy to slip in and out of a pocket (the softer cases sometimes create a lot of friction and are harder to put away or get out). Also the case is formed exactly to the shape of the phone so the phone doesn't ever slip out of the case (which is an issue I had with one soft case).<br /><br />The only drawback is that the hard case makes the phone almost incompatible with my alarm clock radio - the solid extension of the case on the bottom makes it so it almost can't connect (which means it won't charge or play music through the speakers). If I push the phone down just right it works, but it's not as seamless as it was with the softer cases. This isn't a fault of the case but I still took one star off for that since it makes it slightly imperfect for my purposes.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|I have just started reading this book several days ago. due to the author's fame on writing the Windows Internal, i am really curious to see how he will do in writing. There is no flashy words. Some chapters are technical and easy for me to read. it seems as a support engineer, we have the same language pattern to describe 1 concept. Mark also shows his troubleshooting experience as an engineer like reading the dump and doing the narrow down jobs.
0913866156|5.0|This is my first Tarot card deck and I was surprised to see how detailed and beautiful these cards are! My friends have had experience with the Crowley deck before and tell me these are the good quality ones. I would really suggest these cards to anyone getting in to Tarot, they're great! 5 stars.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The Walking Dead combines traditional zombie horror genre with traditional soap opera, gives 'em a good shake, and adds a dab of sci-fi for the topping. It's all good -- for those of us who love zombie movies, good old soap opera drama, and sci-fi.    The \\"high concept\\" here is the mix of different genres. The zombie genre has evolved to often include some reference into sci-fi -- the question, \\"Okay, I understand the dead are now walking around eating people -- but, uh, WHY are they doing that, exactly?\\" (The answer, of course, is always something like \\"Dr. X mixed the Reanimator serum with the Godzilla Virus, and now it's gone airborne!\\")    Oh. That explains it.    The weirdo bogus science aside, this series delivers with atmosphere -- the large-scale scenes of deserted streets are more chilling than the scenes of seemingly endless wrecked cars. The gore is not excessive, but it's definitely there -- even if there wasn't a \\"need\\" to satisfy gore fans, it's still a realistic part of the plot: dead people walking around, looking to kill living people - something bad WILL happen.    Toss in the tear-jerkers, the messy relationship, and some characters that we can almost but not quite care about, and it's a wrap! It works as a basic thrill flick with some poignant scenes here and there -- it has a bit of trouble (doesn't every movie and TV series?) at times, having an especially bumpy ride due to the lack of any message or central thematic note.    But it gets there. Despite the bumps, the ride gets to its destination, and you wanna be there when it does.
B00001R3GC|4.0|This album is great.But it's not as good as Beggars banquet, Let It Bleed or Exile. Simply because all the songs were recorded at different times in different places. It's kind of like tattoo you. All the songs are very strong, but this album would have been better if all the songs were re recorded together. Then the album would have flowed better.
0811876373|5.0|I love this book! It is so easy and I love all the different decorations you can do. So far, I made the sheep and bunny and everyone loved it!
B000W93CXQ|4.0|Read a 5 star review then read a 1 star review. I agree with both reviews of this story. The bottom line, I feel, is that you will get out of this story what you bring to it. It's the kind of story that forces an opinion out of you. What the characters do/say will have you either empathizing or loathing them. It's really your personal opinions of suicide and how your teen years went that will give you a favorable opinion or not.     That said, I found the writing is more than solid. The story line is compelling and suspenseful. It's one of the few books that I've found hard to put down and the first book I've finished in years within less than a week, not because of it's length but because I wanted to make the time to see what happened.
B004H6OWU2|4.0|I first heard her on the Magnetic Man collection ... sort of clubby dubstep which has its moments, and thought her contributions were the standouts. For some reason, at that time Amazon hadn't released the album in the US: it was only on offer from importers thru their system. This is worth buying. I'm not making any predictions about future output, but she seems to have a good ear for lyrics and catchy tunes.
B00133KFGW|2.0|I was excited to see this film because I love fairy tales and those types of stories. This isn't really one. And compared to something truly wonderful like Pans Labrynth it's pedestrian and cliched.     I can't actually believe how many good reviews it got, which just goes to show that one mans meet is another mans poison! I found it very sickly and just too cloying for my tastes.     The cast were great however (waste of a great cast IMO) - well except for Robin Williams who over acted commendably. Jonathon Rhys Myers was good and the child actor was amazing. Just a pity they had such a weak story to work with.     If you fancy checking it out though i would say to do so, it;s not an offensive film and obviously a lot of people really love it.    Oh and it has Alex O'Loughlin in it for about all of three minutes but he steals the damn film with those minutes and he's very, very, very pretty here. So yeah two stars for Alex. It would have been one otherwise!

B0052U59F4|5.0|One of the best fan fics I have ever read, primarily because it is almost entirely not derivative.  This story stands on its own!
1416955070|4.0|That's a really dramatic summary right there! This was a fantastic book! It is the first I've read by Cassandra Clare and definitely will not the last. We are introduced to the story and the main characters in Pandemonium (very clever by the way) and get off to a great start that really had me wanting more! I was a bit confused at first about who was who and what was going on but that soon sorted it self out as Clare skillfully draws us into the story and brings the characters to life. Clary has a lot to deal with in this first book of The Mortal Instrument series. I love that we are taken along on this ride, I really felt like I was there alongside Clary and Jace as they face the many (many) obstacles encountered. The whole plot progresses insanely fast, a lot happens within a really short space of time and I think this was one of the many things that really grabbed me. I needed to know what was going to happen next!<br /><br />Looking back after reading it I would say that perhaps the developement of Clary's character was a bit forced and rushed. There was a lot of very strange things to accept and she (and her best friend Simon) seem to accept all of these as totally fine and dandy. I'm pretty sure that's not how I would have reacted but hey, maybe Clary is just that much more awesome than me. Because she is amazing! Clary is everything I like in a female protagonist: confident; take charge; and kick butt. She doesn't let Jace push her around. I did have some issue with the supposedly instant connection made here and then was promptly left slightly baffled by a late revelation in the book  that put everything on its head. Sorry for the vagueness but I really don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet. Those who have read it probably have a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about.<br /><br />My favorite character was Alec. He was sweet and didn't get too much to say or do throughout the book but he was the one I really felt a connection to. I think that his character has a lot of potential that I am really hoping gets to be explored later in the series.  Jace is slightly annoying, in that `I'm so hot and amazing and I know it' way, but was then adorably vulnerable at times. I can certainly see why legions of ladies have fallen for him! The other characters all were well-developed and I hope that we get to see a lot more of Isobel, Simon and Magus (who I loved!) later.<br /><br />All in all, an excellently written start to this amazing series! Well developed, beautifully described, this world within a world will definitely be getting another visit from me!cter has a lot of potential that I am really hoping gets to be explored later in the series.

B0016PM722|4.0|Overall impressed but after swinging it around vigorously the \\"blade\\" has become a bit loose after only a few mins, was expecting it to be a bit more durable than that. Otherwise the light up effects look awesome!
0061537969|5.0|Enjoyable in every way. I love that Enzo, the dog, narrates the story. Great characters, great plot, great insights into what a dog might be thinking. Enjoyed the ending, too. I look forward to re-reading soon.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is an excellent and frightening documentary.  It brings to light how the economic crisis, which reached its zenith in 2008, was created.  It's complicated for a layman like me and so I have viewed it several times.  What's grossly unfair is that the men who created these problems not only have never been proscuted but also are still running the finances of our country and, to \\"rub salt in our wounds,\\" are still being paid several thousands of dollars to rip us off.  As one person in the film says, and I'm paraphrasing, engineers build things while financial engineers build dreams, until they become nightmares.    The pathetic thing is that none of our presidents from Reagan 'til today really know how the finances in the country work.  They are taking various economists advice.    Economics has and will always be \\"junk\\" science.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|I am not sure what happened to Morbid Angel.  I am a fan since \\"Altars of Madness\\" and was looking forward to this especially after hearing \\"Nevermore\\" on you tube for the last 26 years, but this is a severe disappointment.  I actually liked some of their more experimental stuff on past albums, but the stuff that appears on here is just not good.  Too extreme?  Are they too extreme to start a side project where David Vincent can spout his moronic lyrics over rap or tecno beats and not tarnish the name?  I can almost see the moron cast of Jersey Shore \\"beatin' back the beat\\" to this song.  The Mars Attacks song - seriously?  I know Trey is a video game/anime nerd and so am I, but I wouldn't write a song about it, at least not under the \\"Morbid Angel\\" moniker. RADIKULT?  Don't get me started on that, it's a bad song by any standard in any genre.  It's like throwaway Rob Zombie track that after he heard it said, \\"this sucks, we can't put it on the album\\".<br /><br />As far as the more \\"traditional\\" songs, that gets them the extra star, but even these songs aren't mind-blowing and I feel they aren't up to the Morbid Angel standard.  They might be good for an average band, but if you start comparing them to songs like \\"Chapel of Ghouls\\" or \\"Day of Suffering\\" the songs start to show their blandness.  Looks like their only recourse is to start praying to some Sumerian gods - maybe Trey will get some awesome riffage and songwriting skills back, maybe David Vincent will start writing dark and introspective lyrics, who knows.  I hope the next album is called \\"Just Kidding\\".
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is extremely well-written and I recommened it for all those wanting to remember their own youthful romances. This book will have high school seniors and college girls wishing to experience their own romance. The characters all have wonderful detail of their feelings and makes the reader feel what they feel. I read this book in one setting, then read it again! I think this author has great potential for future romances.  Recommended for 17+
B004GJXQ20|5.0|From the first page I was in love with this story. The novel is split into many different chapters, repeating in sequences as it is told from the eyes of each main character. George Martin does not just create an existing world of ancient kingdoms, brave knights, passionate and proud families, he reveals it to you as if it had always existed. You fall in love with the loyal and strong Starks, the brave and true Baratheons and end up loathing the power hungry Lannisters. Secrets twist as lies are told, innocents are killed, children are slain, towers are immense and shadow over time as men play their game of thrones. Families are betrayed and stand up against evils, there are even tales of dragons and ghost riders in the deep woods. Overall this is just the beginning of an amazing saga and I can not leave my kindle alone a minute because of it.
0440243688|4.0|Gone Tomorrow is the second Jack Reacher book that I have read.  Although the prior Jack Reacher books may have offered more depth to the character (why does he choose not to have any possessions and live on the street, for example), a prior knowledge of Jack Reacher was not necessary to thoroughly enjoy this book.  The story is fast paced and riveting.      The story line follows Reacher as he moves effortlessly through the dark parts of New York as he tries to solve the mystery behind a suicide that he witnessed on a subway car in the dead of the night.  Although Reacher's invulnerability and constant control of the situation require a bit of suspension of disbelief, it still makes for a good read.    Gone Tomorrow isn't a book that will have a permanent place on my bookshelf, but I wouldn't hesitate to loan it to a friend.  I enjoyed Gone Tomorrow and I look forward to reading the next Jack Reacher novel.
0307477479|5.0|This was an incredibly creative, exciting, and unique novel that was, in my view, perfectly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize it received this year.  The experimental writing style and strong, relatable characters kept me interested throughout the entirety of the novel. Somehow, Jennifer Egan managed to create a book that is both comfortingly familiar and wholly innovative at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I cannot wait to read more of her work.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was by far one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The story line is gripping and engaging.  You really begin to identify with the characters and the book pulls you in from the very beginning.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy!

B004BJMEO6|5.0|Best ever yet! The actresses were the essence of beauty and the acting is the most believable of all of Ms. Conns films. Storyline kept moving so well you were sitting on the edge of your seat trying to anticipate the next scene. Very very good movie and everyone should have a copy for their library. I love it. Good job.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|I honestly can't speak for the sequels that came after this film, but I can only imagine they don't hold a candle.  FIRST BLOOD is a great story, told incredibly well.  Once this film gets kick started around 10 minutes in, it doesn't let you go.  By far one of Stallone's best performances, on par with his role in COPLAND, not to mention Rocky.<br /><br />As an action film it's great, as a comment on the times and the stigma attached to Vietnam vets returning from the war, even better.<br /><br />I didn't watch this film for years just because I assumed it wasn't worth the time.  Once a very good friend of mine forced me to sit down and watch, I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it years prior.<br /><br />Even if you don't care for Stallone that much, you might reconsider checking him out in this one.  I'm not saying he'll change your mind about a career worth of so-so films, but he might just win you over for life on this film alone.<br /><br />Now that I've lambasted Sly's career of movie choices, I must back track and say, even though they aren't brilliant on a \\"good\\" level the following are brilliant on a \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" level:  COBRA, ROCKY III, and OVER THE TOP.  There are certainly more to choose from, but I rank those as pretty high.<br /><br />Regardless, FIRST BLOOD is a winner on many levels and shouldn't be dismissed or missed.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I like to get value for my hard-earned dollars, as most people do.  So I considered buying the far less expensive Zeikos wired remote, until I read the horror stories of that plug breaking off in the camera body.  I spent the extra money for the genuine Nikon product and I am glad I did.  The Nikon remote works perfectly with my D3100.  Nicely made and satisfying to use.  The plug fits perfectly, not too tight and not too loose.  Sometimes the lowest priced item is not the best deal, and this is one of those times.

1931559317|4.0|I think it will prove to be a great book to use. It seems to be a bit complicated for me to understand. However I am going to the Australian bush next month, and taking my telescope, so I hope to be able to view some great celestial objects and to take some great photographs, using my previous purchase of astrophography, and the Sky Atlas together.
0156030306|4.0|Imagine getting the opportunity to live the life you've always dreamed of; to have your life not only physically, but chemically altered. Daniel Keyes creates this situation exactly for his two main characters, Charlie and Algernon. Flowers for Algernon is the story of how a mentally retarded man named Charlie Gordon gets turned into a genius through the use of scientific experimentation. Throughout the book, written in a diary-esque style, the reader travels through Charlie's experiences. Keyes' specific style creates a sense of emotion and friendly connection between the reader and the protagonist. While promoting a sense of caring and love for those with mental disabilities, Daniel Keyes shows the roller coaster, and ultimately negative effects of scientific experimentation through his personal writing style and dialogue.     Keyes' diary-esque writing style, with Charlie speaking in the first person, is a very effective tool in hooking the reader and keeping their attention. Charlie's diary entries let the reader practically see his transformations through his speech quality and feelings. The book starts off with the line, \\"Dr Strauss says I should rite down what I think and remember and evrey thing that happins to me from now on\\" (1). You can see immediately that this story is unlike any you have read yet. The dialect creates a personal connection from line one. Keyes' also makes an impact by expressing an important theme in his book - love and respect others no matter their physical or mental conditions. Charlie's coworkers are extremely disrespectful to Charlie and while he doesn't realize it, it is apparent to the reader through the novel's dialogue; \\"... Charlie had his operation. What'd they do, Charlie, put some brains in?\\" (22). This novel sparks the readers' emotions as they see a defenseless, loving man being disrespected because of his mental condition.    I support Daniel Keyes in every aspect of this novel. His themes are inspirational, his story isunique, and his writing as a whole is entertaining and hooking. I recommend this novel to young adults and adults, because I believe that one is never too old or young to learn the life lesson of how to love yourself and others around you. Flowers for Algernon has the potential to inspire many to become respectful individuals.

0143034901|4.0|A very entertaining and engaging read.  The book captures the feel of Barcelona, and has a pulpy, noir element to it that is enjoyable.
0553381695|4.0|In this second volume of the series (which I began because the quality of the recent HBO series enthralled me), George R. R. Martin carries his tale of discord, violence, magic and collapse in Westeros (the land of the Seven Kingdoms) forward from Book I. This is a huge story with no sign of its ending yet at hand (there are at least three more equally fat books to go). The incredible length and the complexity of the story line are finally beginning to weigh on me though.<br /><br />I like big books and love long stories -- epic tales -- but I also like the sense that, when I've closed a volume, there have been resolutions of note. I like the feel of satisfaction at book's end, the sense of awe when important characters have attained something and the movement of the book comes to a definitive conclusion -- even if it's only to entice us toward the next movement awaiting in the succeeding volume. But in Clash of Kings I've begun to feel the strain, and no little irritation at the constantly shifting storylines, especially when I've become engrossed in the travails of one character only to be redirected to those of another in the chapter that follows. George Martin is very, very good at moving us along in the narrative and at limning vivid, even fascinating, characters and societies. His people, especially, are much more than the typical archetypes of fantasy (even if their concerns and mores belong to another age than our own). But his penchant for shifting the line of action from plot strand to plot strand, chapter by chapter, is wearying and not a little dizzying.<br /><br />In this \\"episode\\" the Stark army is moving south toward Lord Tywin Lannister's army out of Casterly Rock while, at Kings Landing, the Lannisters have placed the dead king's son by his Lannister wife on the throne. But Prince Joffrey, now king, is a meathead as well as remarkably vicious while his mother, Queen Cersei, who had engineered the coup that brought him to the throne in place of her late husband, King Robert Baratheon, seems to have lost some of her cleverness since the first book. With her dwarf brother Lord Tyrion's sudden appearance as their father's emissary, the queen finds herself upstaged by her younger deformed brother whom she holds in contempt, as he takes charge of the mess she has made, proving himself more than her match. He is also, it turns out, more than a match for the schemers of the Small Council and for the two approaching Baratheon contenders for the throne, the self-styled kings, Stannis and his brother Renly.<br /><br />Lord Tyrion is also far shrewder than his predecessor, Lord Eddard Stark, had been -- no doubt because the latter was blinded by the demands of honor while Tyrion Lannister entertains no such illusions. And yet Lord Tyrion turns out to be one of the most sympathetic figures in the tale, cynical, ruthless and scheming yes, but he's also a damaged soul (for the misfortune of his deformity) and capable of empathizing with those he must sometimes misuse, defeat or slaughter.<br /><br />Meanwhile, far to the east, Queen Danaerys Targaryen, last of the dragon blood of the Mad King (whom the late King Robert Baratheon, Lord Stark, the Lannisters and other rebellious nobles had deposed fifteen years earlier), finds her way across a deadly desert to the ancient city of Qarth. With her ride her much reduced band of Dothraki horseman, Ser Jorah Mormont, a dishonored knight of Westeros and three newly hatched dragons. At Qarth the young dragon queen will find new opportunities and new enemies as she seeks to advance her plans to return to Westeros and restore the line of her fathers, the Targaryens, on the Iron Throne. And to the north of the Seven Kingdoms Jon Stark, bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark and now a sworn brother of the Night's Watch, is moving still farther north of the Great Wall into the Haunted Forest to learn what's afoot among the increasingly restless and fierce Wildlings and the other dread forces oflegend which share the unknown land with them.<br /><br />As King Robert Baratheon's two younger brothers, Stannis and Renly, each separately claim the throne for themselves and move inexorably toward Kings Landing and an inevitable settling of accounts between them, Lord Tyrion Lannister scrambles to prepare the city's defenses and delay their dual advance. Robb Stark, now self-declared King of the North, wins a series of significant but not yet definitive victories in the field against Lord Tywin Lannister, the father of the queen mother and of Tyrion, and grandfather to the new king. It's Lord Tywin's ambitions for his house and for his own power that drives his little family.<br /><br />All the while, Lady Catelyn, Robb's impetuous and strongwilled mother, struggles with the sorrow of a dying father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun, and her dead husband, while trying to find a way to save her younger children, now scattered across the Seven Kingdoms. The two youngest boys remain at Winterfell, despite its reduced defenses, while her two daughters remain prisoners of the Lannisters in King's Landing -- or so she believes.<br /><br />Sansa, the oldest daughter, continues to live in her fantasy world of noble and chivalrous knights while, all around her, the evidence before her eyes cries out the falseness of such fantasies, not least because her betrothed, King Joffrey, has taken to having his noble knights beat her bloody according to his whims. Her younger sister Arya, resented by Sansa for her willfulness, has been spirited out of the city by the Black Brother Yoren after witnessing her father's treacherous execution at the hands of the spiteful child king Joffrey. Yoren has promised to see Arya safely back to Winterfell as he heads northward with his newest recruits, taking her along in the guise of a boy (the Black Brotherhood being limited to males who have sworn themselves to celibacy and a life of service until death at the Wall). But the land they must pass through to reach the north is awash in blood and savagery and they are ill-equipped to traverse it. Meanwhile Theon Greyjoy, son of Lord Balon of the Iron Men and once a ward of Lord Stark who had raised him with his own children, contemplates his own brand of treachery under his father's banner, covetuously eyeing the underdefended keep of Winterfell, King Robb's ancestral home.<br /><br />Arya, in the company of the recruits to the Night's Watch, finds the lessons in swordsmanship, courage and stealth taught her by Syrio Forel, her fencing master at King's Landing, slip rapidly away in the face of disaster after disaster and brutality after brutality and, in Winterfell itself, her crippled brother, Bran Stark, second son of Lord Eddard Stark, struggles manfully to play the lord in the absence of father and older brother while wrestling withhis own fears and uncertainties about the future. Only Bran's direwolf, one of the great wolf cubs raised from birth by each of the Stark children, offers him a way out of his situation -- if only he can see it. But the adults in the keep have penned up Bran's wolf along with the wolf of his younger brother Rickon while Theon Greyjoy prepares to lead a contingent of men from the Iron Islands against them.<br /><br />And that's just to scratch the surface of this massively complex tale. Martin tells it well and creates a  vivid picture of a world in flux, of kings in strife, of evil beings massing in the north, and of a lost queen who must brave the hazards of a brutal land, assassination and wizardry to raise the last three dragons in the world who are now in her keeping -- until she can finally use them to regain a kingdom she has never known. This second in a multi-volume tale is less a book in itself than a tangle of interwoven skeins in an epic tapestry. You can't read it in isolation from the others because it starts and stops in mid-story and ends on a completely unresolved note. But if you like reading vast tales and fantasy and epic are your thing, then it's surely worth it.<br /><br />Stuart W.

B002SRQ214|5.0|I love the 965.  People clock these up to 4.0 GHz with no problem.    Best money I've spent.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I saw this in the theatre when it was released. I scanned the auditorium and saw one gentleman in attendance, typical for an Austin flick I suppose.  Before the film started a remarked to a lady in my row that I wished this would be different than the four versions I already watched that week.  I told her they should start it in the middle and tell much of it in backflashes.  They DID!  I was thrilled and very satisfied as this is a really original retelling of a very captivating story. The actors were well cast and I think the photography helped make it the best screen version. I confess that I only read the book once years ago and I do confuse the storyline with the 20+ adaptations. I think the story in this film is a good mix of all the plotlines. If you leave out the brutality of the Aunt's home or the Orphanage or Helen's death, you cannot imagine the depth of Jane's isolation. All the actresses, of course, were never as plain as the character is supposed to be, but this actress has an enchanting quality that endears. So if you collect \\"Janes\\", collect this one!
B004WJRF6C|1.0|I don't know how to write this without getting attacked but it's the truth so if you are going to attack understand that I am only speaking my thoughts and opinion. I was about 14 years old when The Beatles broke up. At that time the only solo release I bought was the McCartney album. I don't remember what my 14 Year Old mind thought about it. I just know I didn't play it much. I had moved on to other bands like Zeppelin and ELP and didn't think much about the McCartney album for years. In my later years I started to buy the solo albums as they were re released and remastered as I did with The Beatles catalog. I have most of the Lennon catalog and probably half of the McCartney. I was waiting for some remastered releases and bought BOTR when it came out and was going to wait to buy the whole archive collection as it was released.<br /><br />I bought McCartney and McCartney ll Tuesday and put McCartney on for my ride home from work at the loudness level I usually listen to CDs looking forward to visiting with this old friend I hadn't really heard since I was 14. By track 10 I actually had to pull off the road I was laughing so hard. This CD is absolutely pure cr*p! It sounds like one of those old one man band guys you see at carnivals and I could actually picture McCartney sitting in his underwear at home with a tape recorder and cymbals on his knees recording this dreck! I could not stop laughing! Of course Maybe I'm Amazed came on so for the 3 or so minutes I stopped laughing. There is no way, no how that anyone other than a Beatle would have gotten a record company to release this amateur peace of garbage. It is now my favorite comedy album. I then realized they're selling a $60 version of this CD and I can only think that people will buy that so they can hit themselves in the head with the hardbound book while listening to it! Also why a lyric book and no liner notes? If I took out all the repetition in the lyrics the lyric sheet would fit on a cornflake!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There are always things that we love and things that hate about our favorite movies. There are very few movies that from opening scene to final credits that I've said \\"wow, this movie was perfect, I couldn't find anything wrong with it.\\" Star Wars is no exception. I am sure that if you would ask Lucas he would tell you himself that there are things that he would have done differently, even after the 2004 revamps. I was born in 1980, so I wasn't there for all the hype and grandeur that surrounded the first three, but I have still been able to sit back and relax and have a great time being a part of one mans imagination.<br />The fact that this is coming to Blu Ray seems to be a sore subject for lots on here. I don't see what the big deal is. Blu Ray is just the next thing in video entertainment, so naturally, Lucas and all others that have a say in SW, just want a piece of the pie. I don't hear anyone going off on Short Circuit 2, Big Business and all the other terrible movies that should never have left VHS that somehow squeezed their way onto the Blu ray shelves.<br />I've heard people whine about the features on this upcoming set and I just have to say something, I've seen Star Wars more times than I can count and only until recently have I sat down with my popcorn and watched it with the commentary and I found it very interesting. Hearing the back stories about what they did and how they did it was entertaining, (here comes the big but) BUT (told ya) if you are not interested in the actors and creators story behind the films then you will NEVER spend the time listening to the commentary, so in short, does it really matter what is in the commentary? If you've never listened to it on another film, then you probably don't care enough to comment about it on Amazon.<br />I also have heard people caterwauling (huh?) about the fact that it will be out in 2012 in 3D and then quickly on 3D DVD, so why put this set out at all. Not everyone has or wants a 3D TV, so stop wailing about this release. Enjoy it for what it is: a long awaited collection of movies that have never been put together like this before. When it comes out in 2012 buy it...or don't, it's not going to make a difference. People who collect movies and are fans of Star Wars will STILL buy the 3D versions, even if they already have the many previous versions, yes that includes Phantom Menace special edition. (ha!) Oh, a quick side note while we are talking about EP1: STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT JAR JAR!  Look, I have no love for the floppy eared idiot but knock it off, he didn't ruin the movie, he was intended. Lucas admitted that when he first created Chewie, kids were afraid of him (I have no idea what is wrong with the kids in 1977 but I digress) and he wanted to make someone that the kids would like and NOT be running in terror of. He succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. The royalties alone from Jar Jar Binks Halloween costumes alone must have paid for his own Death Star. He is a story teller and a business man, wanting to make money. So, can we just stop going on about the stupid Gungan, please?<br />So, to sum this all up, go out, buy the Blu Ray Version. I am sure that it will be lots of fun, invite the gang over, have a Star Wars Marathon, watch Luke get his hand cut off, learn who Vader really is (spoiler), make fun of young Anakin, laugh at Salacious, Watch Vader get his hand cut off, root for the bad guys, watch Dooku get his hands cut off, spot all the errors, shout \\"Han shot first!\\", watch Panda Baba get his hand cut off, ask why Obi Wan is always bellied up to a bar, watch a Clawdite get it's hand cut off, show it to the kids and people who have never seen it before, explain the details better than 3P0 at the end of Return of the Jedi,  Hug a Dug, Bonk a Gonk and then watch Anakin get his hand cut off!! Above all, enjoy yourselves....or don't, trust me, it won't matter to anyone.
B004SMD4H2|5.0|My wife and I are fans of Fringe and found Haven to be as enjoyable without a lot of the grossness that Fringe sometimes employs. Haven also has a lighter tone than Fringe and the characters are very enjoyable and the stories interesting. The bizarre events that occur in each episode are also couched within a larger storyline and the episodes are well worth watching as either stand-alone or as part of the overall story. There are surprises throughout the season with characters and events and the season-ender is a mind-blower! This is one of my favorite shows and I can't wait for Season Two!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I lost my kindle app on my android phone when my phone had to be reset. I tried to download again and it told me that the app was no longer compatible with my phone.

B003Q6D1YW|1.0|This is much ado about nothing.<br /><br />Patronizing this movie is a complete waste of time. The film comes across as a documentary but I don't believe in any of these characters and the film carries no credibility with me.<br /><br />This movie is about an artsy, New York photographer who gets solicited for a relationship gearing towards romance by a family from Michigan. He first befriends a child, then her mother and then her \\"hot\\" older sister.<br /><br />When he, and his friends do their due diligence, they learn that what has been projected is wholly inaccurate. So what do they do? THEY TRAVEL CROSS COUNTRY ANYWAY TO SATISFY THEIR CURIOUSITY!<br /><br />There is nothing to this movie; no plot, no character development, no conflict, no resolution, no nothing.<br /><br />This film must be the product of a gutsy and totally fraudulent marketing campaign. The movie is marketed as though it is suspensful, as though some big secret will be revealed. That marketing campaign is 100% false!<br /><br />This is nothing more than a student documentary/mockumentary that was hyped into the theaters.<br /><br />If you purchase this, if you lay out any money for this , you have completely wasted your money.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|I'm impressed, I had the original CD version previously and the vinyl...Hear music did everything fantastic in this version...the sound is full, wide...i'm hearing sounds i didn't hear before sharpness i didn't hear before with clarity...also i want to state i didn't hear one bit of distortion (not that mccartney I ever got loud) but there were times it got loud eg the crescendo on maybe i'm amazed it gets loud and no distortion...also i will say this sounds like it could've been recorded in 2010 meaning it sounds modern and there's nothing by way of limitations and most important it makes this album (cd) a real pleasure to listen to as I hope to listen to it again in a day or so and that's the important aspect to buying a cd...to be brief this album is total heaven...i hope heaven is at least 1/2 as good as this album is...can't wait to hear more releases from hear music in the series.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|great movie, watched it a couple times before and i decided to buy it for my own home. problem- i bought this delighted thinking it had subtitles in Spanish as it says above in the description. nope. nothing. NADA. please correct the description. now im stuck with a movie my family finds boring because they dont understand, when i would have liked them to view and take in the important aspects the movie brings to the table.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I watched this movie yesterday and today and I loved it!!! I like how Valerie (Amanda Seyfried,) aka Red Riding Hood isn't a little girl but is a teenager/adult. I also like that the wolf is a werewolf and not just a talking wolf. And Redriding hoods mother is hiding a deep dark secret that will be shocking. I was surprised to find out who the wolf was and I think anyone who watches this movie will be shocked to find out who the wolf is and why the wolf did what it did. I was expecting soo many people to be the wolf but when I found out who the wolf was I was shocked but then I felt of course it all makes sense now!! I also like Gary Oldman as the villianous Father Soloman. I mean I know the movie has its faults. Like the acting from some of the people I thought could have been better. The acting I felt was a little bland. And felt they could have picked cuter guys to play Peter and Henry. Other than that I liked it.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|What a great show, a shame no 3rd season, wish producers would understand that some shows are not on normal TV but on sub channels and are not clearly advertised.Nothing like this is made in Australia and we have to rely on overseas productions, One can have to much sons and daughters, or cops and robbers. So please think of your audience.
B000SMWUPS|3.0|I recently purchased this for my  baby jogger city mini stroller. It looks like a good product other than mine arrived broken.  The velcro is detached from the strap.  Upon closer inspection, the sticking on the other straps are also poorly done.  To exchange it will take 3-6 weeks which would mean not having a drink holder for the best of the summer. If I return it the shipping cost is half the price of the item. I guess I'm going to attempt to repair it on my own.  If that doesn't work, I'll invest in the Baby Jogger Parent Console. If you get one that's sewn correctly, I'm sure it's great.  UPDATE:  I was able to use some gorilla glue to repair the broken strap.  I've been using it now for about 4 months.  HEre are the pros and cons:  PROS: Affordable.  Two drink holders (THis is nice when I'm walking in the morning with husband = 2 cups of coffee OR to hold my baby's bottle & my water.  Zipper pocket in the main console is a nice place to hold my cell phone.  It's just nice to have somewhere to easily throw keys, an extra teething toy, etc.    CONS:  Cheaply made (See above).  Cup holders can difficult to get beverages into. It's nice that they are stretchy so they \\"hold\\" multiple sized beverages BUT they are hard to get cups back into with one hand (In other words, I can't grab a sip of water while walking.) The cup holders are not their own separate compartment so items can slip under the cup holders.  THis isn't a big issue but can be a little annoying. Swings \\"up\\" when the stroller is partially reclined. I have a city mini so this might just be an issue on my stroller.    Bottom line - Given the cost of this holder vs. the Baby Jogger one , I'd still recommend it.  It'snot fancy and a bit quirky but it gets job done.

B0027REDK2|5.0|The w/book was not quite what I expected, but it was also a lot more than I expected...  I expected a paper back to be strapped to a remastered jewel case.  Instead the book is actually the housing for the CD... and not in a crappy over produced way... it is hard to explain but in a classic DD style, although different from their other 4 remastered re-releases... all 5 are completely in my oppionion worth it 200%  Just wondering when the rest will follow suit.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I own it on pc and I now play on android and this is one of the best games ever.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|I reviewed another Amazon Basics iPhone case not too long ago.  It was cool looking but pretty non-protective so I was at two extremes in my opinion - a cool looking case  that showed off the phone but offered little protection vs. a very protective case (Ballistic in this case) that made the phone inside unrecognizable.  This new case though puts me in a better middle category.<br /><br />It is smoke grey, so looks very nice.  It is much more solid than just a simple silicone sleeve.  I feel that this case could protect the phone - not as much as my Ballistic case but much better than the previous Amazon Basics case I tried.  While it still won't protect against water for the buttons and such it's a good middle ground as it offers a bit more of impact protection.  Additionally it comes with a screen protector.<br /><br />Wanting to keep your i-device pristine is understandable as they cost a bit of money.  The fact that a screen protector designed for the iPhone 4 is included (with appropriate holes for the forward facing camera and all) is great.  Additionally the case came with a small lint free cloth (like you would clean glasses with) to assist with the cleaning of the front of the phone and application of the screen protector which is a very nice touch.<br /><br />I feel much better about putting the phone in my pocket as opposed to a belt clip with this case.  The thickness of the case and the screen protector are big factors in this.  So I feel protected while at the same time being able to show off the coolness of my phone.  Overall I really like this one and have been using it ever since it arrived.
B002GYI96U|3.0|It was an okay book. I felt that it was pretty predictable. Totally slow at the beginning. Towards the end of the book I was more into the book. But I believe that towards the end of the book the author just wanted to finish the book and wrap everything up perfectly and quickly (a little unrealistic if u ask me). I think she should have developed the characters a little further since I dont think that people just change their views on life or relationships so easily and quickly as they do in this book & everything's resolved. Overall it was an okay book. Some parts were entertaining and a little funny.
1840220554|3.0|I like Jane Austen so much. It's good to have a complete book of all her novels. The book's quality is good, but all the novels put together into one book, just imagine, too big and too heavy. it's hard to turn the page in the middle of the book and it's heavy to hold it when u r lying down to read it.
0802473156|3.0|I had read many of the reviews posted on Amazon regarding this book, so I was quite anxious to peruse it myself.  Upon acquiring the book, I was surprised and yes, even a bit disappointed.  While the author succinctly narrowed down the \\"love languages\\" to that of only five, his narratives describing each of them are a bit tedious.  Not only does Mr. Chapman fail to hold the reader's attention while describing each love language, he has a tendency to be redundant as well.  I found the quizzes to be a great deal more salient in helping to identify one's own love language, and of course, that of your partner's love language. In short, this book should have been pared down to approximately three pages.  I certainly hope that Mr. Chapman's other books (which I have not read) provide a more interesting read.

I found the Scosche passPORT Charging Adapter also works fine in these same configurations.
B000GCFY0I|1.0|I wanted to enjoy this book. I mean, a critical look at and deconstruction of our appearance obsessed culture and a dystopian glance at the extremes to which it can be taken - YES PLEASE. As the mother of two very young daughters, my heart withers daily as I see the glorification of impossible beauty standards and the ridicule of those not conforming them, always knowing that this excessive obsession with appearance will damage them, the question is just how much.<br /><br />However, I'm very sorry to say that I just couldn't get into this book. First off, I found Tally to be completely unsympathetic. While I understand that she is the product of her culture and society (aren't we all?) and I enjoyed her adventurous side, I found her cowardly, untrustworthy and just dull. Maybe if she was just a bit more like her friend, Shay, in the beginning at least asking questions or wondering about the status quo and how it's all supposed to make sense - because it doesn't, not really, how can a society like that function? - before being thrown into a situation where she's shown how it doesn't make sense, I would have felt differently? I can't honestly say.<br /><br />I also found the plot desperately predictable and unsurprising and the writing mostly uninspiring. While I did enjoy the other characters Tally met during her stay at Smoke (Yay, Croy!) and the conversations with David about appearance, it was all very predictable and formulaic. Even the \\"shocker\\" cliffhanger-ish end was something I saw coming from miles away.<br /><br />I feel bad for giving it only one, but I really just did not enjoy the book at all.
143911000X|5.0|This is a really good book that gave me many laughs. Probably better suited to the fans of HIMYM, this can be read on its own as well, because the book is interesting and fun in and of itself. Recommended.
1592400876|5.0|I bought this book as a means to help improve my punctuation, which it certainly will, if utilized. There are stylistic differences, due to her Brit origins, for those of us in America. But, I can't get through even a page of this book without laughing outloud.   I would recommend this book to anyone.  Period.  Those who want to learn to punctuate with impunity will learn much from this short work, but everyone should get some wonderful laughs.  I read this when I want a pick-me-up! Lynne Truss, you are an amazing, wonderful writer!  This is one of my favorite books.

All the hits are represent and a-ha interacts with the audience, sometimes you can see the emotion in the faces of the band as they address the crowd in what is being billed as their last concert ever.  The production value is high here and needed as a-ha are a sonically dynamic band and the audio quality is great while the visual resolution of the BluRay is very sharp.  If you are a fan, this is a great buy!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This is a great, sturdy case. It's as good as any I have gotten at AT&T. The only thing I don't love about it, is that it says, \\"Amazon Basics\\" in white letters on the back. No biggie, but I like it to be free of writing, for a more clean look.<br />Gives plenty of cushion and protection.<br />And I love that it comes with a screen protector!
B000OVLBEO|3.0|Normally I really don't like Nicholas Cage movies, but this time I really enjoyed a movie he stared in! I'll be honest, I'm not a hardcore Ghost Rider fan, but this movie has sparked a interest in the comics for me. This movie is really really fun to watch. All the fight sequences are well done and the overall tone of the movie makes you feel like one rad dude! I've never seen the original version, but this director cut was great! The effects are cool and the transformation for when Johnny turns into Ghost Rider is extremely impressive, same goes for his motorcycle. Also, Ghost Rider's voice was f'n awesome! The only things I have a issue with are Blackheart didn't look anything like his comic counterpart and the final fight with him was awful. Blackheart is one of my favorite comic villains and it just kinda sucked to see what became of him in this movie. I don't regret buying this movie, it entertained me and that's all that matters.

0062009540|4.0|Okay, I know what you're thinking: how could this person have given four stars to both \\"Among Others\\", the well-constructed love letter to the fantasy genre AND Pretty Little Liars, the first book in a series that spends serious real estate detailing what brand of jeans every single character is wearing?    Well, imaginary reader of my reviews, that is a very good question indeed! I can answer it only by saying that, although the writing in Pretty Little Liars may not be the most sophisticated, and despite the fact that it's almost completely plot driven, with only cursory character development, this book is an incredibly fun read. The hints at future developments and revelations of past secrets and scandals kept me furiously turning the pages, and, let's be real, as a poor student, I LIKE reading about the lives of the ridiculously wealthy. It's fun!    So, while this book is definitely not going to win any awards for excellence in literature any time soon, I am certainly going to devour the next book in the series. I'm just crossing my fingers I can find my way to a beach or onto a plane to an exotic vacation destination so that I can enjoy these books in their natural environment.

0316069353|5.0|Mickey Haller is my favorite Michael Connelly character and \\"The Fifth Witness\\" is a great showcase for what makes him so compelling and interesting.  He's a wounded idealist who manages to convince himself (most of the time) that he's really a cynic; a romantic still in love with his first ex-wife; a doting father; a loyal boss and friend; a man longing for familial ties; and a wicked brilliant, dogged attorney.  The story, especially the last half, signals a metamorphosis for Mickey, and I'm looking forward to where Connelly will take him next (especially if Mickey's latest project, mentioned in the last chapter, is successful!).    The drama here is cerebral rather than action-packed, so this book isn't for you if you prefer explosions and chases.  However, if you like smart, taut legal dramas with a very flawed but ultimately good and likeable hero at the center, I highly recommend \\"The Fifth Witness\\".
0345529057|5.0|Here's the briefest possible plot summary of Ice & Fire to date (Volumes 1-4): Five factions are at war for the Iron Throne and control of the continent of Westeros. A sixth force is gathering power in the East across the Narrow Sea while ultimate Evil lurks in the North beyond the Wall. I don't intend to tell you any more of the story. To do so would be a grave disservice. It would ruin the shocks and surprises that await the reader. To borrow the tag line for the movie Sucker Punch, you are not prepared. No more story, but I do have more to say.     A reviewer for Time magazine dubbed Martin \\"the American Tolkien\\". It makes me wonder if this reviewer has ever read The Lord of the Rings. You'd be hard pressed to find two more different Sword & Sorcery series. I'd say that any child who is old enough to want to read LOTR should do so. That's not the case with Ice & Fire. It's far too grim and gritty, far too bloody, and far too sexually explicit. Another difference is plotting. Once you get into LOTR you can pretty much know where the story is going to go. There may be a few bumps in the road, but it's pretty predictable. Ice & Fire is completely unpredictable. While you're reading, you may think you know where the story is headed. Trust me, you'll be wrong. A third difference is tone. LOTR was written from the perspective of a neutral observer. Ice & Fire is written from the point of view of the characters experiencing the events of the story. (In fact none of these books have chapters. Each section is labeled with the name of the POV character.) As a consequence, Ice & Fire struck an emotional chord with me (multiple ones actually) that I never felt with LOTR. LOTR was like watching a fun fantasy movie. Despite its dragons, sorcery, and wights (reanimated corpses),its giants and wargs (skin changers) Ice & Fire seems very real. It's like you are living the story. One final difference: LOTR is clearly a story of Good vs Evil. The One Ring may be able to corrupt a good person, but basically there is no trouble telling which side a character fits on. One of the many things I like about Ice & Fire is its moral ambiguity. Each of the six factions has a legitimate claim to the throne (at least by its own reasoning). Its true that one side seems more noble than the rest and another is nastier but men on the \\"good\\" side commit atrocities every bit as heinous as those on the \\"bad\\" side. Even the noblest character in A Game of Thrones (Eddard Stark) has warts (marital infidelity) and some of the \\"bad guys\\" turn out to be sympathetic characters.     I must confess that I have never been fond of overly long novels. I suppose then that I should explain why I ordered this box set sight unseen. I had read the two prequel graphic novels, The Hedge Knight and The Sworn Sword, published by Marvel (based on George R.R. Martin's novellas). I liked both but not enough to buy these megabooks. Then I was blown away by the first episode of HBO's Game of Thrones series. That did it for me and I'm so glad that it did. I've just spent a big chunk of the last month or so of my life immersed in this fantastic world and loved every minute of it. Four books back-to-back-to-back-to-back, 3882 pages without a break (not counting the appendices). I've never done anything like that before and am unlikely ever to do it again. For me that pretty much defines \\"page-turner\\". Martin is an excellent plotter. He uses the same technique J.J. Abrams used with Lost. Every time you get to a point where you've just got to see what happens next, he switches scenes. I could almost hear the sound that indicated a scene change in Lost. BRrruuUPP. Oh,no, don't stop now. Not now!     I don't give out 5-star ratings easily. For me 5-stars means the work is exceptional. If ever there was a 5-star series this is it. (I should add that Volume 4 is not quite as good as the previous three books, but that's because my two favorite characters, Daenerys of House Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister the Imp, do not appear in it. That will be remedied next month when Volume 5 comes out. I can't wait.) If Martin maintains the quality of the remaining volumes, this series will truly be a monumental achievement.

B004SC7B6M|5.0|I have enjoyed most of the WT albums so far, but I believe that this one is my favorite. Solid theme, well produced and a great feel. The songs are initially very catchy, and get better as you start to get a feel for the lyrics. I have always enjoyed a darker theme to my preferred media and this comic/vigilante theme is nicely laced with many of these elements.

B002VHI8FE|5.0|I thought the author has an original approach to the battle scenes.  I like the way he handles the magic...simple, not over explained, not too fancy...but with some potentially sinister side affects.  The characters are interesting, flawed and dark.  Some humor here and there.

B001CEE1YE|4.0|The complete Matrix Trilogy is just that, its complete. If you want every little morsel of information but the Matrix then go look at the ultimate version.  This the 3 movies and some of the bigger documentaries about the movies. Since I don't want to get up and go downstairs to check. I will say that I believe the animatrix is included but could be wrong.  As for the video quality, AWESOME. The sound is AMAZING especially if you have a 5:1 sound system but if not it will still rock your socks off.  We are coming up on the 10th aniversary fot the trilogy and there might be some new remastered versions coming out but until that happens this is the blu-ray set to get.

When my husband and I need a relaxing evening, Joe to the rescue. This DVD and a glass of Circo creates a romantic evening...Joe is a smooth, dynamic performer..I just love this DVD and I hope he makes more. Trust me, its well worth it...
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I'm shocked that the woman who could come up with so much amazing music fell totally flat on her face with this album.  It's nothing but dissonance, and I can't really say I enjoy listening to screeching noises, something akin to the sound Jim Carrey made in the car next to the Hitchhiker in Dumb 'n' Dumber.  My god, Lady Gaga......this album totally blows.  I was so excited for it because Born this Way was amazing.  and then every other song is just GOD AWFUL.  I can't even pretend to write an eloquent or reasoned review of this.  wow.  Thank God it only cost me ninety nine cents.  FAIL.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|After my wife got a 3G Kindle, I though it might be nice to have a Kindle too, but when I realized I could get an Android tablet that was more portable and more like a PDA than the Kindle, I switched up.  I think I installed the Kindle reader first.  It's a nice implementation and I can't think of anything off hand that I would do to improve the user interface EXCEPT you should be able to see the time while reading.  Doh.  I don't want to have to exit the reader to see what time it is.  Ok, so the Archos 43 has a large screen, and I can see that one might not want to use up the screen real estate that way on a smaller screen - but make it an option then.  Please.  Pretty please.<br /><br />---<br /><br />2012/11/29 Update:  The app can open PDFs, so it is not necessary to have another PDF reader taking up space on your device.  I love that.  I hate that Amazon apps are HUGE and get more HUGE with every update.  This should be App2SD.  I'm going to downgrade my 5 rating to 4 on this point alone.  I love the reader, but the size of the app is making me have to uninstall other stuff to keep it on.  At some point, the Amazon app is going to have to go so I can keep the other stuff on the tablet.  Get a clue Amazon.  You are in the app store business.  When your apps take up all the room on the device, people can't buy other apps anymore!

0345529057|5.0|I do not usually read fantasy books. My shelves are filled with non-fiction, mostly on military topics. But when a friend lent me the first book of this series (A Game of Thrones), I fell in love with it. Eager to read more of the fantasy genre, I read other series, but none could compare to A Game of Thrones, so I went back to the series I loved most. Because I didnt own any of the books, I picked up this bundle, which I might say is an amazing deal!   I dont think I need to go into detail on why I love this series, as it has been said so many times already.  My only negative comment would be that the print smudges a little bit. Not serious, but it can be annoying.    So, put down Harry Potter and pick up A Song of Ice and Fire!
0345529057|5.0|Came fast, great product. Trying to finish the first one now and the rest of them before Season 2 on HBO. Highly recommend watching the series
0393338827|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book!! After reading Liar's Poker and loving Michael Lewis's writing style and storytelling ability this book does not disappoint. The book tells the story of what happened during the most recent financial crisis caused primarily by the collapse of the mortgage sector through the stories of 4 groups of people that foresaw the collapse of the sector and made large bets on their predictions. After writing an undergraduate thesis on the subprime mortgage crisis and the involvement of Goldman Sachs and AIG, I can say that this book still taught me a great deal about what happened in an very interesting and easy to understand way. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that has any interest in learning about what happened during the financial crisis.

For such young guys, their music is phenomenal!! I couldn't wait for their new CD \\"Set the World on Fire\\" to come out! I raced to the store after work on 6/14 and got one of the few copies left at the store. At 38 years old, I was like a teenager waiting for the next Motley Crue album to come out! Fantastic guitar riffs and a great blend of fast songs and ballads! Bottom line.....................MUST HAVE! It will never leave your CD player!

B002T45VX6|5.0|Shakira definately has a distictive voice.  When you play one of her cds, u automatically enter in the bizarre world of Shakira.  I can picture other singers doing some of the songs on here,  But when Shakira gets on a roll, she makes each song hers and I happen to enjoy her style of singing.  Almost every song on here is good, so far what I listened to I really like. I wish however that she kept the spanish songs at the very end.  You have to skip past those just to get to the last englsih song \\"Give it up 2 me\\".  The arrangement sucks on this cd.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|A wonderful book, simply not to be missed. The language is rich, poetic, sensitive. All the nuance of snobbery, social mores, hierarchy of the time and English culture is beautifully portrayed.<br />Du Maurier's love of Cornwall is strikingly set against Monte Carlo. The house, Manderley, comes alive - we live in the rooms.<br />There is depth to the portrayal of Mrs Danvers - we feel her loss - yet we are never on her side. But the genius of Du Maurier is that we are swept along to accept the facts of Maxim's actions. We collude.<br />The Hitchcock film avoids this, but Du Maurier was not squeamish, and in joining with her heroine we become criminal.<br />Deeply thought provoking. A novel in the true sense.
B004132HZS|5.0|Can't wait for the next season. I watched the first one with trepidation, expecting it to be cheesy, or silly. I couldn't imagine it being done well. It wasn't, it was done BRILLIANTLY! The translated the meme of Sherlock into a modern day show that was gripping. Can't remember the last show that made us both say \\"Wow, oh wow!\\" at the end.
B001V7UXG2|3.0|It's the outstanding series with greate actors. But there aren't any subtitles on the DVD. English is not my native language so I prefer to watch a movie and to read an english text at the same time.<br />I bought this DVD, of course, and try watch but I'm sure that lost ~60% of the humor.<br />Still: ~40% that I got is marvellous.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I was one of the lucky few who got to see this video when it was first premiered in select theaters. I was hesitant to attend because I had no idea what to expect and didn't want my love for FOO to be lessened... but it was INCREDIBLE! It made me love them even more... a hundred times more! I'm comfortable saying that even people who aren't fans of their music will still love this video... it's humorous, emotional, captivating, and uplifting... and best of all it's a true story! It really allows you to have an intimate connection with Foo... I feel like I grew up with them now! I suggest checking it out.. now!
034552554X|4.0|Is the storyline a little romanticized? Yes, a bit, but it is a novel so I think that is acceptable. But it is a moving, engrossing story that keeps you reading from the opening chapter to the final pages. I greatly enjoyed the character development of Victoria and her accompanying cast. The only reason this book gets a star off is because I think it lost something in the last third of the book- I'm not sure what, but it lost some of it's charm and some of the character's stopped developing. Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it, but just don't expect a hard, nitty gritty story about the corrupt foster care system, while this is part of the story it is so much more and it shows.
0062060554|5.0|When I put this book down after reading through it in one sitting, the only semi-coherent thought I could string together was: Oh.My.God.<br /><br />'Before I Go To Sleep' is not your typical thriller... It shocks from the very first page and that almost eerie stream of consciousness writing only served to amplify the shivers it caused. Yes, it's another amnesia story, but there is nothing gimmicky about this one, only a realistic and often frightening portrait of a twenty something trapped in the body of a middle aged woman. It was profoundly moving that not only were her actual memories gone, so is her entire sense of self. Christine is not even aware of her own body's transformation in the years since her brain injury, and that is what S.J. Watson so flawlessly explores here,  and what will inevitably send the shivers down your spine.<br /><br />This story is absolutely incomparable to a light romantic comedy such as 50 First Dates. It had a substance, credibility and incredible flow that I've never taken from any other book or movie dealing with the same topic. Not to give away any spoilers, but I also thought the conclusion was the most profound part of the entire book. It was thought provoking and nothing at all the way I expected it might end. It just blew me away, and I feel like I'm still picking up the exploded bits of my brain hours after finishing it.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this film, but what a treat it was! I won't summarize the plot, I don't want to give away anything, but this was just such a perfect movie.  I went out so happy, I could have gone to see it again today! Owen Wilson is made for this role, in fact, there is no one I could imagine doing it better. He exudes the same bumbling charm and awkwardness as Woody Allen did in his early Film roles.  An excellent cast, script and stunning to watch.
1439156816|2.0|Most of this book is autobiography which is fine if you are a big Stephen King fan.  Personally, I just wanted the advice on writing which is a small portion of the book.  I'm glad that Stephen King shared his thoughts on writing, but I didn't find that portion of the book very helpful.      First of all, King worships Strunk & White's Manual of Style.  In college, I usually got A grades on my papers.  Still, I wanted to improve my writing, so I decided to write in the terse Strunk & White style.  That paper got a B.  I went back to my regular style of writing and got A grades again.  My experience of using the Strunk & White advice was that it limited my flow of ideas and stilted my writing in an unpleasant way.  Therefore, I'm not keen to follow any more Strunk & White advice despite King's enthusiasm for it.  Strike one.      Strike two:  King says a \\"good\\" writer can never become \\"great\\".  A \\"bad\\" writer can never become \\"competent\\", but a \\"competent\\" writer CAN become \\"good\\".   Who is King to say what people's potentials are?  That advice was a joke.   Who even defines \\"great\\" and \\"good\\" etc?      Strike three:  Most of King's writing is instinct!  He plots organically while letting the characters do and say what they will.  That is seriously not helpful advice.  It may be 100% accurate as to how he works, but just sitting there and letting the characters do the plotting isn't helpful to me in my own writing.        I'm grateful that King let me peek into his mind for how he writes, but as to anything helpful..... sorry, not much at all.
B002WFWCAM|5.0|A very beautiful limited edition for this interesting sonic experiment in line with the 90´s.   The album comes in a 52 page book with evocative photos and little frases of the songs, The design serves as a time capsule, It really captures the essence of the time this disc was released, in sound and in image. The paper is thick and grainy so the images look some more vintage.   Monster is probably the ultimate underrated album by the band, but if you listen to it closely, you will find a very propositive album with some of the finests R.E.M. songs. (Strange Currencies, Bang and Blame, Let me in, I don´ sleep I dream).  Great guitar work from Peter Buck.   Worth the extra cash, really enhances the experience of the album as a whole, even more if you listen to it very very loud.
B002RV01QI|5.0|The Very Best of Enya is a very strong compilation of musical melodies by Enya that showcase her unique blend of singing and harmonious musical melodies.  I first heard of Enya back in 2001 when I heard the musical gem that is \\"Orinoco Flow\\" on one of the \\"Pure Moods\\" collections (\\"Orinoco Flow\\" is also available on the first \\"Pure Moods\\" collection). In addition, one of my friends from high school (who I miss and was one of my \\"spiritual sisters\\") listened to Enya and allowed me to hear what I think was Enya's Watermark cd.  My then fiancee that I met in Japan (who luckily is now my husband) also introduced me to her (he also had the \\"Watermark\\" cd).  I decided to purchase this cd when I found out online that Enya was releasing this greatest hits collection, and I am very happy that I did.  In my humble opinion, all of these songs on this cd are great to listen to and relax to.  My top two favorites are \\"Only If\\" and \\"Only Time\\". \\"Only If\\" is an upbeat musical track that appears to be about making the best of your life, and taking decisive action towards your dreams.  \\"Only Time\\" is a great song about how only the concept of time is going to truly tell the way certain events in life are played out (metaphorical references are made towards the relationships and emotions arena). One of the most joyful ways to determine if you are going to enjoy this cd is if you like music of the following genres and artists: Enigma, Celtic music, and/or New Age music.

B0041KKYEM|3.0|So I was really excited to see this movie, my dad wanted to watch it with me because he had heard it was good. WRONG IDEA! This movie has so many graphic sex scenes it was too awkward for words, I did not know this going into it so I take responsibility for not reading up on it first.     Anyway the movie itself was alright, I expected a lot more. Movies dont have to explain everything, but I felt like there was no explanation for Nina's insanity, it was just kind of there. The ending was very abrupt but in this case it was a good thing because it keeps you guessing, I like how the concept of Swan Lake tied in with Nina's life but other than that I wasnt too impressed. As far as the sex scenes go, after a while it was like ok is this really needed? It got in the way I think they could have cut out some of it but it's not my movie so whatever.     Worth renting but in my case I dont think I would buy it.
B004Z29WP8|4.0|This was actually a really good movie. Very unique and had alot of funny moments in it as well as sad. Joseph and Natalie's performances were on point as always. And the story was pretty quirky with alot of quirky characters. If you like Donnie Darko you will probably like this film alot. Its a story about loss and how people deal with it. Also its just interesting to see Hersher take over someones home. Trust me this is one you don't want to miss. Its a really really really hilarious journey.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|the critics were idiots on this one most panned it or gave it average reviews. i believe that this is a realistic war movies just with aliens instead. like i say in the title its like Independence Day but on the ground and in my opinion better. it does have some of those military movie cliches but its still good. the way the cameras are it makes it feel like you are one of them right there in the movie with the actors. this is a really good war movie i definitly recommend this as a buy for sure GET THIS i thought i was going to be disapointed because of the critics reviews on this movie but thank god i didnt listen because they were wrong this is a GREAT MOVIE especailly since its pretty much NON STOP ACTION almost through out the whole movie the actors are great in this so hurry and BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Sergeant York falls into a film category, that my husband & I call, \\"A movie that Hollywood would not know how to make today.\\"  Based on the real life story of Alvin York, a humble, country man, transformed from a drunken trouble-maker, to a  God-fearing Christian, drafted into military service, but a conscienicous objector, reconciled to fight after wrestling with God's word, then kills/captures many on the battlefield.  Hailed a war hero, who is unwilling to capitalize on his hero status.  Gary Cooper (what more can I say), Walter Brennan, and the rest of the outstanding cast are a treat to watch.
B0051BVQFG|4.0|If you like shoot em up movie this movies fits the bill.  I was disappointed though that not much more alien views ,or stuff was really there at all.  I liked Skyline much better, and I hope they do a Skyline 2. Aaron Eckhardt however, did a fairly good acting bit, in this movie.
0143038419|3.0|The fact that I'm writing a review for \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is a modern miracle. The fact that it has three stars from me is also unexpected. But, perhaps, I should start at the beginning.    I believe in reading books before seeing the films that are made about them. After not being able to watch the movie \\"Eat Pray Love\\" with friends because I hadn't yet read the print version, I finally got around to reading it. Initially, I was excited. I love travel and I found Gilbert's style of writing to be entertaining and self-depricating. This lasted for about the first twenty-five pages, when I quickly realized this book isn't all it's cracked up to be.    \\"Eat Pray Love\\" is about New York writer Elizabeth Gilbert's experience in spending a year away from home in the quest to find herself and repair her broken life. She pledges to spend four months in Italy devoting time to pleasure (mainly of the pasta variety, but also the joy of doing nothing), four months in India studying the art of meditation to deepen her spiritual life, and finally four months in Indonesia (Bali) learning how to balance the earthly and the divine. Along the way, Gilbert chronicles the people she meets, various situations she finds herself in, and channels her thoughts as she works on this quest.    The writing is entertaining. I like that it sometimes stops to add details, almost like a conversation. However, at times, it can be annoying. Gilbert tends to drag throughout parts of the book, and I quickly tired of the woe-is-me routine. She had a rough divorce - we get it. Yet most people who experience difficulty in their life don't have the luxury of just taking off around the world for a year, financed by the expectation of a book about the trip. As much as the book is interesting, I tended to think of it as fiction because it is so far from reality as to make it almost a tale.    Admittedly, I almost gave up after finishing the Italy section. I love Rome, I love the Italian language and culture, butshe spoke so little about the city itself, instead focusing on her backstory. The details about her \\"transcendental\\" experiences in India were quite over-the-top, yet I found them highly entertaining, if more for a \\"Is this woman serious?!?\\" laugh than anything else. However, Gilbert redeemed herself somewhat in Indonesia, which featured likable characters.     I can certainly understand why \\"Eat Pray Love\\" has so many mixed reviews, and it's not a book that I would recommend to people. However, I'm not entirely upset that I finished it. There are sections that are somewhat thought-provoking and I can see how this would appeal to a certain type of person. I'm just not that type.
1594202710|4.0|If you look at the latest iPhone or the latest iMac, the number of boards to be placed and soldered by hand inside is now only 4.  It used to be 40.  I can understand running to China to solder 40 things inside a tight enclosure.  But the next iPhone 5 and the next iMacs will have 2 robot made parts that need to be put into place by hand.  Now at one point you can hire American workers to position 2 boards at $ 20 an hour.  Yes the Chinese work for $ 2 an hour, but to position 2 boards is not that much labor.    The boards each hold many components, but they are all robot placed.  The labor is to position 2 boards inside an enclosure.      Similarly technology is moving in many other products, PCs, cameras, etc., to have 1 or 2 machine assembled boards.  At one point transportation across the world, the difficult communication with the language barrier, the jetlag time difference will bring the work back to America.    I believe a lot of assembly currently performed in China is really a historical extension of the fact that the previous model had so many parts that it made a lot of sense to make it so far away.  The gadget I manufacture used to have over 100 parts to place by hand.  Now it has 4.  I still make it in China, but transportation has gone up.  Soon, when electronics become an enclosure and 1 chip inside, the fear of Americans to actually put two things together will wean.  We need a business friendly environment where businesses can procure capital.    Similarly, advances in battery design even currently make it that electric cars can travel 80 miles daily on one charge.  That would satisfy 90% of commuters.  A USA policy to reward electric cars to be purchased would dramatically reduce the need for oil imports.    In 10 years both issues will have been solved, and American innovation will reign supreme.  I've been working with Chinese factories 20 years, they are wonderful people, but God help them they have no creativity at all.  They are hard workingand order takers supreme.  Not once in 20 years did they suggest one improvement in the products we make.  No suggestions.  No manufacturing or marketing creativity.  If technology is able to be applied towards simplifying the internals of our products (and I see that happening fast), at one point the simpler design can be made in USA, saving transportation and communication.    This point is now in my opinion the heart of the matter.  Historical perspective is one thing.  The fact that we hire the Chinese to make everything is based on savings.  Technology has moved.  If the political climate will allow USA companies to hire Americans without the ineficiency  of taxes and unions, work can be performed here.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This movie is sort of a \\"no brainer\\" and has the feel of a 60's Cary Grant or Gregory Peck romp, but I suppose that is why I enjoyed it so much. Angelina Jolie pretty much cruises through the movie in high fashion and with beautiful make up. Johnny Depp on the other hand is a hoot as he subtly hams it up. The movie becomes predictable about 2/3 the way, but at that point it's \\"So what, I'm having fun watching this movie\\".

1455816361|5.0|I am the biggest Ray Bradbury fan in the world. So when I heard the Colonial Radio Theatre was doing a full dramatization of this book, I didnt know what to expect accept quality worksmanship<br /><br />After listening to this whole audio drama. all I have to say is WOW! yes one word says it all..WOW, that is is complete..Wow that is is fleshed out from the Bradbury's text..Wow, that it is a the vision I heard when I read the original book..Wow, that it is more than craftsmamship on this production.<br /><br />I thought their [[ASIN:1441892192 Walter Koenig's Buck Alice and the Actor-Robot]] was amazing piece of audio work...this production is in a whole new catagory<br /><br />For those Bradbury fans who love audio.. Screw the Bradbury 13  production (if you can find a copy)..as much as I love caedmon's recording of Leobard Numoy reading Usher II, miss that (well listen to that and you will see CRT is better)..as must as I also enjoyed William Shatner read a few Martian tales for Caedmon, miss those too...[[ASIN:B0035ITRHG OMNI Audio Experience (Original 1987 CASSETTE Tape Featuring: Stories From The Martian Chronicles, A Revealing Interview with Ray Bradbury, Brilliant Sound Effects & New Age Music)]] is nothing compared to this  ..this is the holy audio grail of Saint Bradbury. Does you know this is the labor of love to Bradbury fans and lovers of great science fiction<br /><br />Okay I go on too much..This is best audio I ever heard of Martians. the CRT has done their work well..and Jerry Robbins is the modern  Orson Welles of Radio  and he keeps proving it over and over again<br /><br />So why arent you buying this yet?<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz<br />AUDIOWORLD
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, for reasons which some people have already illuminated. Note that there are two run lengths mentioned here, 149 and 282 minutes. The 149-minute theatrical version and the 208 minute Director's Cut are both included here, but not the television mini-series version, which is just fine by me. The second disk is supposed to contain special features like the \\"Captain's Tour\\" and \\"historical material.\\" Now, one thing that disappointed me about the television and the superbit version on DVD was the absence of Petersen and Prochnow's highly entertaining commentary track, which was included on the original double-sided DVD release. Most commentary tracks are forgettable and dull, but the track for this film, which had been ported from the Laser Disc version, is never less than informative and often amusing over its three plus hour length. According to what I've read, there is an audio commentary, but only Petersen is named. I'm hoping that this is just a misprint, because the film was just as enjoyable watching listening to that original audio commentary track as it was with the film track.
1903490529|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1K3RY7GCHIOEF]]\\"THE WAY WE WERE\\" - MEMORIES OF THE POST WAR ENGLISH BAR<br /><br />An Appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Derek Wheatley's new book, Brief Encounters consists of five short stories, each tale as much a memoir as a narrative.  Each, except the final story, is based on a criminal trial in which the author acted as Counsel for the defence at the beginning of his career over half a century ago.  We're talking here about the same era, approximately, as Rumpole of the Bailey, are we not?  Okay, Horace Rumpole is fiction, but Derek's book, fiction though it is, is based on actual cases, the like of which Rumpole never encountered.<br /><br />\\"Brief Encounters\\" really tells it like it is at the Old Bailey, or rather, like it really was at the Old Bailey in the fifties and sixties.  The names of the protagonists as well as antagonists have been changed, obviously, to protect their identities and spare their blushes. The reader is left with the impression that, but for skilled advocacy, they would all have been judged `guilty as charged.'<br /><br />Take the story of the Romeo and Juliet-style feud in North London, which centers on a romance between Ismet, a Turkish Cypriot and, would you believe, Julietta, a Greek Cypriot. `My only love sprung from my only hate' observes the author quoting Shakespeare, adding that `Ismet was probably not very strong on Shakespeare.'<br /><br />Press on, dear reader, for a number of pages and you'll find out that the enmity between these two ethnicities culminates with an attempted murder via a 12-bore shotgun.  The victim is not seriously injured, but it all ends up at the Central Criminal Court, The Old Bailey - in Court No. 1- reputedly a special court reserved for -- the crimes most heinous -- as Poirot would say.<br /><br />This is all quite a coup for young barrister, Tam Pearse, the main autobiographical character in this and the next three stories which intriguingly, are chock full of atmospheric description and sixties nostalgia -- the sort of minute, but pertinent detail you might predictably find in a witness statement.<br /><br />`A trial by jury is certainly war for the counsel taking part in it,' observes Tam who, in this case, was so convincing to the jury that his Turkish Cypriot client got off.  As is often typical in these situations, Tam is less triumphant than bemused, with some lingering doubts as to whether justice was really done.<br /><br />The last story in this collection is of a slightly different ilk.  Here, a new barristerial character called Lumsden has an illicit fling on holiday near Santiago de Compostela with an aristocratic beauty who prefers to remain anonymous, thank you.<br /><br />But who is this lovely lady (whose first language is not English) who refers to herself as a `keeped woman'?  Lumsden finds out only when he peruses the Jennifer's Diary section of Harpers and Queen magazine.  He's by no means a regular reader of this fashion and society mag, you understand.  He merely picks it up while in the dentist's office and in so doing makes a surprise discovery which we will leave you to guess at.<br /><br />If you're old enough to remember Jennifer's Diary in the days when Harpers Bazaar was called \\"Harpers and Queen\\", you will certainly enjoy this book. If you aren't, you'll find yourself intrigued anyway, by this almost quasi-Victorian mixture of (as T. S. Eliot would have put it), `memory and desire'.<br /><br />This curiosity of a book should be much enjoyed by courtroom drama buffs and certainly those members of London's close knit legal fraternity who are happy to immerse themselves in the atmosphere of legal London in a bygone age.pheric description and sixties nostalgia -- the sort of minute, but pertinent detail you might predictably find in a witness statement.    `A trial by jury is certainly war for the counsel taking part in it,' observes Tam who, in this case, was so convincing to the jury that his Turkish Cypriot client got off.

0345529057|5.0|A read for any fantasy fan. Swords and sorcery and politics amidst character driven story lines. The price of the 4 book set makes it too much of a bargain to pass up.
0375842381|5.0|This trilogy is a wonderful summer read. It just sucks you in and is filled with imagery and imagination. The movie The Golden Compass probably left you confused, but that's because the movie had to leave out a lot. This is a great book for both young and adult readers. The length may scare younger readers off, but these are way better than the Harry Potter series. A MUST READ!

Trying to instill patience and control in his new assistant, Bishop sets out to teach him the ropes (basically how to kill someone and escape notice). Engaging and entertaining, this movie was chopped full of great fight scenes, great action, and a decent story line. \\"The Mechanic\\" was well worth the $1 that I paid to rent it.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is a wonderful documentary on World War II made in the early 70's.  Laurence Olivier narrates it with calm and style.  The documentary is broken into sections to tell complex mini stories to make a whole.  Holocaust, Bomb, Burma etc, are some titles in the story.  It is stunning to see how much there was to tell about this world war.  The documentary about the making of the series explains how the film crews were divided and dispatched to many parts of the world.  One of the most special aspects of the series is that so many people involved in WWII were still alive and healthy to tell their story.  It was so good of Sir Jeremy Issacs to film this story and give it life.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|First off, gotta say, yes there are such people.  It's hard for non-Southerners to accept that such seemingly broadly drawn characters really do exist - that there are people who have broken down cars and shootin-refrigerators in their front yard.  Yet, if I were to go outside and throw a rock I would be quite likely to hit something matching the squalor in this movie.    Yet, the accuracy of the milieu is tertiary to the point of the movie proper - up to and including the fact that meth is the community vice and trade as opposed to moonshine or black market pantyhose.  I only mention it because most of the pro and con arguments I read are focused on this or that particular detail that the movie presents.  OMG, the hero is a girl.  I'm not even sure what movie people walk away having seen, since they can't penetrate the curtain and actually watch the film with open eyes.  In some ways the movie has a whole separate life as a test to reveal the mental furniture of the beholder.    Pretty much everything great about the movie has been ground to meal by now - the superiority of the cast, the luminosity of the cinematography, the deliberate pacing and intrigue, the disturbing moments.  Yet I think one essential and primary element of the film is overlooked - that this is a movie about hope.  Ree casts herself fearlessly into the jaws of very nasty people not because she wants to, not to prove a point about herself, perhaps not even to accomplish the goal of saving her small family.  She does what she does because it is the only path she can see to take, and she meets the obstacles one by one with determination, yes, but mainly hope.  In the end, she believes in the underlying potential for simple human goodness in the older people she confronts far more than they would believe it in themselves.  I believe that that's what keeps us compelled to watch.  Far from being a \\"bleak\\" movie, as it's often described, it is a movie that asks us where our own courage and faith in humanity might be - perhaps makes us remember a time when we could have been Ree.  This is what sets \\"Winter's Bone\\" apart from other movies that attempt to be bleak and full of despair - lord knows we have plenty of them.
B00542EG0E|5.0|Maybe it's due to my low expectation, but I have to say that I was quite impress with the album as a whole. I didn't get paid to right this review. If this CD was garbage it would have been well noted and on the selling block on amazon.com. Let your ears define this album.
0007274939|5.0|I love this book, it covers everything. I bought this because I love the outdoors and self-reliance. This would be a great book to have with you if you are a sportsman, backpacker, homesteader, or if you  just love this kind of information. I read a review where someone complained about the British terminology but anyone with sense can understand what is being said. Everyone who has seen it wants to borrow it, even my Eagle Scout friend. Great illustrations, plant identification illustrations are in color. I would definitely recommend this book. This is NOT the pocket sized book, it is a full size book. 576 pages including the index, there has been some poor reviews because a few people bought the pocket version (GEM) by mistake.

B004UXUXGE|4.0|\\"The Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\", Werner Herzog's (\\"Grizzly Man\\", \\"Rescue Dawn\\") new documentary is a fascinating look at a very rarely seen archaeological find.<br /><br />Herzog was given rare access to a recently discovered cave in France. The Chauvet Cave, so named after one of the people who discovered it, contains some of the oldest, most pristine cave drawings ever found. In an attempt to preserve the find for future study and, hopefully, further discovery, access to the site has been severely limited. But Herzog was allowed to bring in a skeleton crew to film the drawings and share them with the public. The director made the decision to use a 3-D camera and entered the caves via a narrow passageway.<br /><br />Once inside, the cameras begin to roam over the craggy interior, capturing all of the stalagtites and stalagmites. Then, they capture a drawing. And another. And another. And each is more stunning than the last. What you immediately realize is that this is an instance when the use of a 3-D camera was not only a good decision but a vital decision. The artists used the contour of the rock formations to help bring their drawings to life. The bumps and crevasses in the rocks help to give the paintings movement. And the 3-D camera captures this for us, making us feel as though we are standing directly in front of the drawing. You almost want to reach out to touch the drawings.<br /><br />\\"Forgotten Dreams\\" is an amazing work for this reason, and almost this reason alone. And it is wholly worth the price of admission. But the film provides very little other information simply because they don't really have any other information yet.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is all about what they did to prepare after they got permission to enter. There is a little information about the discovery of the cave and the people responsible, but not much. Then, when he enters the cave, he explains that due to tight circumstances, his crew will inevitably show up in some of the footage.<br /><br />But as his camera begins to roam over the walls, and the drawings come alive, you can't help but be mesmerized.<br /><br />Then, in an effort to give us more background, he talks to a few people who try to fill in the blanks. But there just isn't enough to tell about these people yet, they are still researching, trying to figure out who they were, so some of the information presented in the film, in particular, some of the interviews, seems extraneous. They do have information about how the cave was preserved so well and this gives us an idea of what happened so long ago.<br /><br />Herzog talks to a few people and they give what information they have. One demonstrates a flute he made, in an effort to recreate an artifact they found. The flute is 'like' some the people at the cave 'may' have used. It's a thin, tenuous connection, but it makes the film interesting.<br /><br />Then he returns to the caves and his camera spends time on each of the drawings, capturing them for our eyes, letting us take a look at something we will probably never be able to see any other way. As he shows us these images, he comes across a partial image of a woman (the only one in the cave) and reveals he was not given access to the other side of the rock formation where the drawing continues. I understand why they limited access to this site, but it also seems like they could have let one person spend five minutes in another area to take video of the entire image. The image is fascinating, but incomplete. While I am grateful to see any bit of it, it seems like relatively little damage would have been done to capture it for millions to see on video.<br /><br />There is a strange coda involving Albino Alligators who are living nearby the caves which is strange and doesn't really connect to the rest of the story. It almost feels like Herzog was trying to make the film meet a requirement of 90 minutes.<br /><br />These are small quibblse because once you get to see the drawings, nothing else really matter.<br /><br />The quibbles aside, \\"The Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" is a fascinating glimpse of a great discovery. It's definitely worth your time and money and you should see it in 3-D.gotten Dreams\\" is a fascinating glimpse of a great discovery. It's definitely worth your time and money and you should see it in 3-D.

B0035G02MW|5.0|As an older, hard-of-hearing person who spends alot of time in the audiologist's office, I loved this book as it so accurately portrays the embarrassing, humiliating, frustrating and/or comic situations we get ourselves into when we attempt to participate in the world of the normal hearing, especially with the younger generation. This is not a literary evaluation as that is not my background; rather it is purely a personal reflection. Thought it was a delightful read and , much as I hate to admit, found it quite comic. Finding the reader's reviews comments on deafness most interesting.
B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men: First Class is a perfect example of how superhero movies sometimes aren't just CGI battle after CGI battle. X-Men: First Class is a wonderful movie that even surpasses the previous X-Men films.     Story:  The story for the film is excellent. It draws out the individual personalities of Xavier, Magneto, and Raven (Mystique). Each actor is perfectly suited for his/her role, making the individuality of each character really shine. It seemed as if Cyclops was under-developed in the original X-Men trilogy, despite the fact that he had a fairly major role. This film gives each character just as much screen time as he needs. Not only that, but the film also presents a story that is clever and raises interesting moral questions. The basis for the story is how Magneto and Xavier have similar views, but one difference - whether regular humans are enemies or allies - makes a huge impact, especially in the original trilogy. This film sets up the conflict well with the introduction of Sebastian Shaw, a mutant who believes that humans should be eliminated. This mutant influences Magneto, causing him to question Xavier's views.     rating 5/5 stars    (minor) SPOILER WARNING:    It is also interesting how Xavier was at first unwilling to torture Frost for information, even though it was the right thing to do, which Xavier realized when Magneto did the job. Even though Magneto was a villain, he had some traits which Xavier adopted, improving Xavier in the process. Thus, it wasn't just Xavier teaching Magneto, but it was the other way around as well.     END OF SPOILERS:    Visuals and Sound:  The special effects in the movie are first-class Hollywood material, and the music is also above average. Magneto's theme offers a unique central basis the the villain action themes in the film. The movie also has other themes that mesh well together. Although the music isn't something that you'll love and want to hear over and over and over again, it's still probably worth a buy. Theway each mutant uses his powers is very well done. Everything from Azazel's jagged knives to Beast's fur is exellent.    rating 4.5/5 stars    Overall, X-Men: First Class is one superhero movie that you will not want to miss. It has plenty of CGI battles, without sacrificing the story.   overall rating - 4.7/5 stars

Within the next few days, I viewed the movie trailer and it inspired me to pick up the book once again. I read it within two days. It was funny, cute, and also quite sad. I wasn't expecting their relationship to turn out as it did. But, I still loved it and would definitely recommend it. I can't wait to see the movie.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I've always been a 'fair weather fan' of the Foo Fighters, but this is the album that converted me over to true fan. Without Dave Grohl, the rock world would be a much sadder place nowadays.<br /><br />As an audiophile, I also appreciate his decision to record the album completely on analog tapes (which you get a piece of when you purchase the CD!) and Butch Vig for agreeing to go back to an old school, literally in a garage, recording session. The sound is there in all its uncompressed, analog goodness. It is so refreshing in this day of compressed \\"loud\\" music produced to sound good just on the radio. Every cymbal crash, every guitar chord is audible in its raw glory. Kudos!<br /><br />My favorite tracks so far are \\"Arlandia\\" and \\"These Days.\\" Catchy and not depressing. Enjoy this album, as this quality is becoming rarer and rarer in our iPod world.
B000RZGFZC|5.0|Season's is an absolute masterpiece and the most complete Slayer album to date. It has the technical and progressive sound of South of Heaven along with the speed of Hell Awaits and Reign In Blood. The lyrics are less dark but more believable and they stop writing corny satanic lyrics about murder and suicide for shock value. In fact there's no profanity throughout Seasosns (PA is for violence and disturbing themes). Most of all they moved out of the stereotypical metal scene and the lyrics forcuse more on politics, war, society and violence. Dave Lombardo's drumming is excellent along with the complex guitar solos rather than the random notes played on Reign In Blood or the traditional guitar riffs from Show No Mercy. Rick Rubin's production is excellent and it doesn't sound like it's 22 years old. It includes their 1990 classic hit, Dead Skin Mask. They changed direction on South Of Heaven but perfected here. Seasons is a masterpiece and Slayer at their peak. In my opinion, it's the best metal album of all time but that's open for debate.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|For being such a simple concept, this game is a lot of fun.<br /><br />For those of you who have not played any version of Angry Birds yet, I'll explain.<br /><br />In this game you are the birds and the birds are angry at the pigs because the pigs stole their eggs. In order to get back at the pigs and to get their eggs back the birds devise a plan. The birds load themselves onto a slingshot and launch themselves at the pigs various fortresses. You are in charge and you decide how to fire the birds at the pigs. If you have killed all of the pigs before you run out of birds, you win the level. If you score a certain number of points you can earn one, two, or three stars for the level. This continues on for anywhere from 14 to 25 levels before you have defeated the particular game.<br /><br />It seems like it would repetitive, however, because the levels get progressively challenging and are varied, the game is actually quite addictive.<br /><br />I would definitely suggest you download this for your Android and see how much time you spend on this game.<br /><br />-Cheers
B000002JPA|5.0|This is the best Dream Theater album and it's one of the best albums I've ever heard, possibly my favorite album of all time. It's a masterpiece and one of the best progressive metal albums. Most albums today aren't as good as this, very few. It's one of the most accomplished efforts by any band. Metropolis Pt. 1 \\"The Miracle and the Sleeper\\" is my favorite song by Dream Theater and one of the best songs I've heard. Several other Dream Theater albums are also amazing but this will always be their best and nothing will ever pass it. Another Day, Surrounded & Take the Time are also amazing and some of the best songs ever made and written. James Labrie's a talented singer and the songwriting is excellent.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|fun game but get the &quot;Loading&quot; screen multiple times during each level which makes it very annoying to play for more than a few minutes.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|If you love Firefly then it's a given you will love Serenity. It's an extension of the series and has all the same feel and pacing that you would expect from the series. If you aren't familiar with Firefly it's is a space opera kind of science fiction (high adventure in space) that combines the classic cowboy show type elements into a really neat package. It may seem like a weird combination, but it works in a really nice way. It's best for you new folk to check out Firefly first, then come back to me about Serenity.     Now Serenity, like I said before, is very much an extension of Firefly. You get a good mix of plot twists, comical moments, and drama peppered throughout a story. This particular chapter starts off simple then opens up pretty big. One thing I notice though was it felt like an extended and well produced television show instead of a movie. The pacing and how the plot opens up has an episodic feel to it. But don't let that keep you from seeing Serenity. If it's like a TV show, it's like the best TV show you will ever see on the big screen.     While this movie only had a budget about $40 million you wouldn't know by looking at it. They put that money on some fantastic special effects. The scenes in space are beautiful to behold, both the calm ones and the massively large ship battles. I'm talking about ship battles with more intensity than Star Wars Episode III. Even if the movie feel likes a TV show the audio is a major boost up and the added effects do stand out in a very good way. The acting is so solid you will find yourself liking more than one character in the movie. The music is also a nice blend of that space opera soundtrack and old west.     This release is essentially a re-release of the Blu-Ray and DVD in one package with one extra never before offered: A digital copy disk. Finally you now can upload a legit copy of Serenity to your portable device, which a lot of people have been looking for. Here is a list of all of the features:     Alliance Database - Includes dossiers on all of the Firefly crew, profiles on planets, various historical entries, vehicle references and details on the reavers.     U Control - This is broken down into four sections: Mr. Universe Compendium, Digital Tour of Serenity, Picture in Picture and Visual Commentary. It appears these are all interactive features instead of simple menu items.     BD Live: My Scenes Sharing - Additional content can be offered if you have an internet enabled BD player (and storage space).     Feature Commentery with Writer and Director Joss Whedon - A lot of director-type information like lighting and what camera lenses they used, but mentions nothing in lines of background info on the story. Joss also self-depreciates himself a lot on the commentary. First it's entertaining that he can crack wise on himself, but it eventually gets old.     Feature Commentary with Joss Whedon & Cast Members Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Summer Glau and Ron Glass. They did a lot of cutting up in that one. Fun to listen to for a while.     Deleted Scenes with Optional Commentary by Director Joss Whedon - Nine total. Some of these scenes are nice and some are so-so. Would be nice if Joss made a director's cut and put some of these scenes back in.     Future History: The Story of Earth That Was - Interview with Joss Whedon on how he got Firefly off the ground and so forth.     What's In A Firefly - Essentially a featurette on the special effects of the movie.     Re-Lighting The Firefly - Little documentary on the canceling of Firefly and how it came back to life in the form of this movie. Almost a tear-jerker for fans who experienced it firsthand.     A Filmmaker's Journey - A more in-depth documentary on the creating the movie. Includes some nice details on the actor's and how well they work together.     We'll Have A Fruity Oaty Good Time! - Mini-doc on the creation of the crazy commercial that River went nuts after watching. Comes with the complete commercial.Extended Scenes - Four scenes in the movie in their extended glory. don't expect anything massive. These extended scenes aren't longer by much. I have no idea why Joss doesn't just put these in the disk and call the movie the extended edition. Oh well...     Take A Walk On Serenity - A snarky tour of the set with the director and actors.     The Green Clan - Documentary on Jeff Green the cinematographer.     Session 416 - All five web videos on River's final sessions at the academy they released prior to the movie.     On top of all that you get 2.35:1 1080p video and lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. If you are a fan of Firefly and haven't gotten Serenity yet... well shame on you. If you have the DVD and are ready to make the jump to Blu-Ray... well the previous disk is a bit cheaper now. So this is for those fans who want the digital copy. If you don't know anything about Firefly I suggest seeing the show first. Netflix has it and the series is on DVD and Blu-Ray everywhere. It's best to experience the series and move to this movie as everything comes together much better.
0060179872|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I could barely put it down. It was exactly what I was looking for in a Marilyn Monroe biography. I plan on reading it again. As a huge fan of Marilyn Monroe, I am glad this is the first book I chose to read about her. I would highly recommend reading this book first.. it's that good. I loved the details about every aspect of her life. It filled in a lot of blanks I had about her, from childhood to her death. I am an even bigger fan thanks to Donald Spoto.
B004VRK436|5.0|I went into this movie at first not expecting much, and if you look at it on paper that's exactly how it seems. This observation starts changing with each new scene in the movie opening up a very pleasant experience all around. Zathura is a spiritual sequel/remake of Jumanji, and aside from the whole story being based on playing a board game there are almost no similarities between the two. That being said Zathura is a great film about sibling rivalry and bonding that unfolds in an ever-expanding universe of imagination and wonder. It's a family film best suited for young adults and young at heart.     Here's the plot. Two brothers decide to play an old wind up board game found in the basement. Every time they come to an event on the game it comes to life. This being a sci-fi game those events come in the forms of a rampaging robot, menacing aliens, a wayward astronaut, meteor storms and other sorts of mayhem that systematically trash their house and challenge the brothers to outrun or out-think their way out of every situation. In the process the brothers build a stronger connection with each other that ends with a very satisfying, even if ultimately stereotypical, happy ending.     The story is laid out in such a way where the viewer is learning new things as the plot moves forward. The set up of the characters and their lives, playing Zathura, finding solutions on the way. All of this is done in a way that empathizes with the point of view of the kids. Notice I didn't say \\"through their eyes\\". This isn't a movie trying to pander to younger audiences with goofy gimmicks. The storytelling is mature while at the same time very accessible. As an aside this story just isn't evolving around the family. There is a universe that unfolds from the game that resonates more than just being various creatures and events to build excitement. It comes out as a living, breathing entity of itself that feels like it will go on long after the boys finish with their game.     At itscore this movie is a science fiction film, and the imagination put behind that element on Zathura is really nice. Since the game itself seems to be from the 50's era the robots and spaceships in the film have that nostalgic and classic sci-fi look. If you like the Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers look back in that day you will love this homage to the style. The alien baddies on the film, the Zorgons, are a pretty well developed concept with the creatures having a bit of depth in it more so than just a generic bad guy. They also are the coolest looking reptile alien I have seen.     The special effects for this movie are beyond excellent. Director Jon Favreau (of Iron Man fame) decided to use as much practical effects as possible and the end result is so visceral and tangible that it shames all of those movies who opt for pure CGI for their effects. Real walls come tumbling down. The rocketships and embattled house in space are real models. The explosions and flames are real. The Zorgons (designed by legendary Stan Winston in fact) have real actors in them along with animatronics. When you see a robot running in a kitchen knocking down dishes it's really a guy in a bulky costume slipping all over the floor and tearing up real props. Sure computer effects are used to touch up that robot and add digital backdrops. This amount of tactile interaction makes what you see feel a lot more real. It makes all the difference.     The acting is impressive and shows some real keen strategy in the casting. The youngest kid (played by Jonah Bobo) has the big eyed wonder that moms melt for and had that underdog demeanor that all younger brothers feel at one time or another. The older brother (played by Josh Hutcherson) is a classic \\"boy too old to be a kid and young to be a man yet trying to reach that plateau\\". Both child actors play off their parts with a kind of conviction to the part that impresses me when I see it in adult actors. They are playing kids with kid's complicated lives, andyou believe that to the hilt. Then you have their sister (played by Kristen Stewart of Twilight fame). Her time on the screen is not as long as the brothers, but her interaction with them as the teenage sister sells the performance of that complicated relationship a teen would have with younger siblings. The only other main role was the astronaut (Dax Shepard). Dax plays the part with a natural and casual demeanor that says he's used to being in the middle of all the craziness. In other words the acting is as well produced as the special effects and story in my book.     Zathura didn't do too well in the box office with a lot of people dismissing it as Jumanji without the star power. More the pity, as this movie to me feels like it's much better than Jumanji's special effects-laden showcase, yet many didn't get a chance to experience that. Now you can get the movie on a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack, and it includes all of the great special features found on the DVD along with an exclusive extra. Visually I don't think you can get any better on this sort of film. The details from the live action and models really come out. This BD-50 disk (announced region free) is packed with language options with a DTS-HD English 5.1 master audio track and 5.1 Dolby Digital in five languages (Spanish, French, Japanese, Portugese and Thai). Subtitles are in all these languages plus Chinese (traditional Mandarin I think), Korean, Dutch, Indonesian and Arabic. Here are the features:    Audio Commentary - With director Jon Favreau and producer Peter Billingsley. They have really good chemistry on this commentary and you get a score of interesting information as well as some entertaining banter.     The Right Moves: The Making of Zathura - Goes over the book the movie is based on and how the production wished to honor that book. They also go over the human aspect of the film and in capturing that element in the story.     Race to the Black Planet: A Visual Effects Documentary - This is areally cool making of featurette that shows how they did all of those practical effects I was talking about as well as the CGI and digital elements of the film. You get to see some cool pre-production footage and how they tweaked it in post production.     The Cast - Actor profiles and their comments on making the film. Some cute anecdotes like how Bobo was loosing his baby teeth during filming and they had to get a bridge made for him.     Zorgons, Robots and Frozen Lisa - A featurette on Stan Winston and his company's contributions to the movie.     Making the Game - A little documentary on the game Zathura and what thoughts went behind designing it.     Miniatures - Remember when I said they used miniatures for the spaceships and exteriors of the house in space? Well here you get to see those efforts and get some insight on why they were the best choice.     The World of Chris Van Allsburg - Kind of a tribute to the author of the book the movie is based on. It goes through a little biography of Van Allsburg.     Race Through Space: Virtual Board Game - This is a Blu-Ray exclusive. While all the other featurettes will be on both Blu-Ray and DVD this one is only on the BD. This is a two player game where you race to beat your opponent on a digital board game by answering film related trivia questions.    Zathura is a grossly under-appreciated film that has gotten lots of good feedback from people who saw it, but unfortunately not many people actually did. Sci-fi fans, with families or without, do yourself a favor and get this flick. The Blu-Ray has a lot of great extras and will likely look awesome on top of that.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These great colorful utensils are a terrific idea and a great buy!  I have them hanging on my wall and its a great pop of color in the kitchen.  All of my friends comment on them.    They work very well, and have not warped from heat.  The ONLY thing about these items is that even though they don't touch the counter top if you are stirring a sauce of some kind it will drip.
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|It looks like movie studios are trying various different permutations of their film releases. One way of looking at it is they are trying to provide more options for their customers. Another way of seeing it is they are double dipping. Trying to get you to buy something you already got by offering something never before offered. The new thing that seems to be offered lately is the full combo with a disk that has a digital copy of the movie for easier uploading into your portable devices. There are no other bonus features being offered here. Just the digital copy.     Now that we have that out of the way maybe you don't know what The Last Starfighter is. It is a space opera hinged on the fantasy that video game skills will save the day. This movie was made in the 80's and was designed to cater to the 13 yr old boy with Ataris/ Intelivisions/ColecoVisions/etc demographic. It has its share of action and comedy that, like most space operas in the 80's, has more than one similarity to Star Wars (but then again Star Wars was a homage to the classic space operas of the golden age of television). So it's not high caliber sci-fi, but it's not B-movie fodder either.     The story is pretty simple: Evil leader of evil aliens wants to attack good aliens, so in walks a single hero who is the last hope for freedom. That's about it. The movie doesn't deviate too far from this premise other than to further flesh out the fish-out-of-water scenario of an 80's Earthling thrust into space (as well as a little fun with an alien in 80's Earth) as well as the inner battle of said Earthling to stay and fight for a Star League he doesn't know or stay home and go to community college. A serviceable story, if not deep.     The acting does make the simple story enjoyable to watch. Lance Guest seems to have fun with the role, which works for the character. Biggest props go to esteemed Robert Preston's Centauri, who plays the role with the style of a magician and the charisma P.T. Barnum. Another esteemed actor, Dan O'Herlihy, does a surprisingly good performance. Especially when you consider he is wearing full prosthetics with less facial mobility than the costumes from the original Planet of the Apes. Yeah there is a bit of theatrical \\"drama\\", but that works with the whole space opera motif.     The Last Starfighter is a CGI hallmark as it's the first movie to blend computer animated elements with live action. The CGI is pretty barbaric by today's standards and even back then it was obvious which is live action and which is computer animation. In spite of that the spaceship designs were really cool and in CG they looked awesome. You can't beat the camera angles and fly-byes that computer animation affords. Plus back then this was pretty state of the art.     This release is identical to the 25th Anniversary remasters. It's an MPEG-4 codec on a BD-25 (25 gigabyte single layer Blu-ray Disc) in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It looks like a lot of the original film grain was taken out in the remastering, and for some that could be annoying if you are really into the true theater look. Still the images are sharp and are the best available. The CGI really does stand out, and while I liked it that aspect also separated those scenes more from the live action shots as far as differences in detail, color and lighting. All in all it's a great transfer/remaster in spite of it not being perfect (then again how many 15 year old movies can really stand up to current digitally filmed movies?).     The Blu-Ray comes with a host of features and Heroes of the Screen is the only one high definition. You get a few Blu-Ray centric features like BDLive and D-Box compatibility (that's a motion control chair that responds to queues from the movie). Extras are as follows:     Commentary with director Nick Castle and production designer Ron Cobb - It's informative and entertaining hearing the two banter between each other. You can tell they enjoyed making this movie.     Crossing the Frontier: Making The Last Starfighter - This is also on the DVD. Lance Guest hosts this half hour documentary going behind the scenes on the technical and other aspects of the movie.     Heroes of the Screen (in HD) - Essentially interviews with cast and crew talking about how the movie was made and how they felt about the production.     DTS-HD 5.1 in English and subtitled in English (SDH), Spanish and French - Can't speak for the accuracy of the subtitles, but the English audio sounds great. Not a whole lot of surround sound stuff going on, but then again this is an older movie.     Theatrical and teaser trailer - Standard definition. Not much to say here.     Image gallery - Includes rare production photos, promotional stuff and content from an alternate ending.     This movie is definitely a time capsule for 80's science fiction and is very much a product of that time. If you like that sort of charm then by all means pick this one up. It's only worth the double dip (or triple if you traded up from the first DVD or HD-DVD to the 25th Anniversary) if you really want that digital copy. This is best for new buyers or DVD only owners who want to upgrade to the most formats available.

B0030EWB96|5.0|I discovered Hiromi on YouTube and enjoyed both her solo music and trio performances as well, but I found myself always wanting to hear more of just Hiromi.  That's what I got with this CD.  Each piece is distinct and has considerable depth.  Technically, it is flawless, yet she also maintains incredible creativity.  I especially enjoy her unconventional use of the piano, with pieces for prepared piano and pieces that feature her plucking the piano strings as if it were a bass.  Even after multiple listenings, the album continues to captivate.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Meaningful, fun, different and energetic new album from Gaga.  I can recommend it to whomever is interested in contemporary pop music.
0345529057|5.0|After getting hooked on the HBO series, I bought the first book of the series in an airport bookstore before a flight, then came to Amazon to buy the next. To my surprise, I found this boxed set for under twenty dollars. No matter that I now have two of the first book, the price still can't be beat. The quality of the books is standard paperback issue, no better nor worse. As usual, delivery was timely with Amazon Prime.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I had big expectations for this movie but was let down. Natalie Portman did an excellent job & any praise given to her was well deserved. I wish I could say the same for the movie. It had potential but just seemed to go off in different directions leaving you confused. Some instances you were just left to wonder what actually happened. The sexuality in the movie was just odd. The relationship between the mother & daughter strange. Portman's role comes off as someone that was already suffering from mental illness before she gained the role in the ballet. 28 years old but living like a child. The new role pushes her over the edge and at the end I was left wondering... that was it? If it hadn't been for Portman I think this would have been a total flop.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|Thief Gold is still my favorite game of all time (yes, I even like it better than System Shock 2). This edition is worth it just for Thief Gold. All of the games work well on my 64-Bit Windows 7 Machine running on an X58 platform, Core i7 920 and SLI GTX 460s (a feat that anyone that has tried playing legacy Looking Glass games can tell you, is pretty impressive).    I should point out one very important note for people unfamiliar with trying to run these games on modern hardware...  If you have a multi-core processor (most are these days) then you will need to do one thing in order to get these games to work properly.     there is a great tutorial of a workaround here...     [...]    Either of these methods work flawlessly. I must hand it to Mastertronic though for getting us Thief lovers even this far, and before you dismiss this version as cumbersome because it does not \\"just work\\" out of the box, consider that you are attempting to run a 13 year old game that was made by a company that has not existed for a long time. Do yourself a favor and get these games. They are incredible.
0307346617|3.0|Zombies, zombies, oh how I love zombies. In movies and books zombies never get old unlike such romanticized creatures in the Vampire and Werewolf lore. The scares from a zombie can beat them all.<br /><br />World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is not a straight narrative book like most are used too. The book is comprised of interviews with the author in the role of interviewer. The interviews take place 10 years after the end of the zombie war and are basically recollections of events from various different people from around the globe. The interviewee tells his/her story and then another interviewee's story follows for the entire book. The book is split up into sections of interviews from people talking about the beginning of the outbreak, the lead up to the war, the war itself, and then some final thoughts which showcases the end to several of the interviews throughout the book.<br /><br />Every story is different and while some pull you in there are others that just seem top be there for the sake of being there. I liked the interview style going into this book because it was different but after about a 150 pages in it was starting to wear on me. I started to feel like I would have rather followed 3 or 4 people through the entire ordeal in the interviews rather than every single interview being from someone new (with exception to the very last 10 pages in the last chapter that brings some characters back to talk too).<br /><br />It's a good book but it doesn't have any scares or terrifying parts that cause tension. That is kind of hard to do when the person telling the story is right there safe and sound. It has been reported that Brad Pitt is trying to get the movie version of this going and I'm not sure if this will translate very well into that format. They may have to stream line it and tell it from the time of the Zombie war instead of as a retrospective to it.<br /><br />Not a bad read but not a great read, good none the less.<br /><br />1 Star - Bad/ 2 Stars - underwhelming/ 3 Stars - Good/ 4 Stars - Very Good/ 5 Stars - ExcellentGood/ 4 Stars - Very Good/ 5 Stars - Excellent

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing. Horrifying. Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Funny.<br /><br />The Book Thief somehow manages to capture every emotion and tug.
0316098329|5.0|First off this book was awesome. For me the most endearing part of the novel was that the story and the character development had so many layers. So many so that Donoghue left me wanting to the point where I would have read this book at 1000 pages! The fact that she was able to keep it succinct and still engage me shows how precise she is about what she would like for her readers to take away. She is an amazing literary and I am exstatic to see what else it is she has in store for me.
B004VJJF34|1.0|This is one of those films I've tried to love for years, and still think it's one weird script.  I understand the source of this story was the relationship and marriage of Doris Day to her first husband whom from I gather was a piece of work. Most of the dialogue seems improvised and after a certain point repetitive and self-indulgent. And with the two leads not very sympathetic characters, for me it becomes hard to stay with for almost 3 hours.  But the music is great, and still it fascinates me as an experiment.<br />It also seems to me that Scorsese could not have loved those 40's musicals this is claimed to be an homage to, or this would have been a much different film.<br />But my biggest complaint here is this Blu-Ray release, which is a somewhat improvement over the previous DVD versions but still not to the level it should or could be.  The opening and closing sequences are a marked difference and look great, but the rest of the film is still generously grainy and that should have been cleaned up.  I mean, how many times are companies going to reissue a film in a new medium, not improve it, and pass the buck on the consumer? From VHS to Laserdisc to DVD to the Special Edition DVD to the 30th Edition DVD and now to Blu-Ray.... Are we supposed to wait for this in the 3-D version for further improvements and then buy it again expecting that the studios will finally give us what we pay for?

0316069884|5.0|I am about to celebrate my first anniversary of becoming a vegetarian, and the milestone prompted me to sit down and actually write a review, which I usually don't do. I had been leaning more and more toward vegetarianism, mostly due to being a \\"bleeding heart\\" when it comes to any kind of animal cruelty, and my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to purchase this book. I read it over and over for a good 6 months to really solidify all of Safran Foer's points. I have him (& the documentary Food, Inc) to thank for inspiring me to become vegetarian and plan to re-read often and recommend this book to anybody who will listen. Do yourself, your health, tortured animals, and our environment a favor, and read this book. I hope it changes your life like it did mine.
0425242099|3.0|I love Nalini's books - all of them, but I must admit I was dreading Kiss of Snow because I didn't think Sienna was right for Hawke - and having finished the book I still don't. Maybe I'm biased against the story because of this but I thought the, will Hawke or won't Hawke, take her was too drawn out and he became less alpha as the book progressed. Not only that, the continuing Psy war bored me - nothing new.<br /><br />What I did love was Lara and Walkers sub-romance which I would have loved to see in a full book, all on its own. They had real inner torments, motivations and conflict to overcome. I loved their story.<br /><br />Still a good read, and if you love her series you have to read it, but not one of her best.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I searched for 3d movies this came up so I bought it for 40+ dollars when it came I found it was not the 3d version it was the 2d version collector series(I should have read better) but it should not come up when you do a search for 3d blue ray movies!! I was quite pissed off, I did another search and the actuall 3d version came up and they wanted well over 100 dollars for it that is a bunch of crap no blue ray is worth that much and to pay 40+ bucks for a non 3d version I feel I got suckered!!!
B003Y5H54W|1.0|Nothing is more annoying than Love Triangles even in books nobody wants to read about them. The whole her father wanting her to go with him...that's just icky. An the father was so familiar...oh, yeah, its Bella's father from the twilight movies. Here's a thought why doesn't hollywood get regular joe's like you and me and screen these stinkers and say hey fix this, this, and this and it will be better. Get rid of the whole love triangle...get rid of the incest daddy angle and let's face it I love Gary Oldman ever since he was in Dracula but this was his worst acting. And talk about copycat they had to hire an actor for Peter that looked like Robert Pattinson. And the whole Red Riding Hood has an evil side inside her...look people want their heroine's sweet and nice.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|I'm a long-time Peter Murphy fan, and have seen him perform countless times at this point. When I heard him preview the songs from this album at Mezzanine, I knew we were going to have a strong album on our hands. I was not disappointed. Standout tracks include Memory Go, Velocity Bird, and I Spit Roses. Worth the wait.
B000WC39SG|2.0|Beware this Blu-Ray edition. It is simply the movie with none of the extras that are included in the \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD. No audio commentary, no documentaries or featurettes.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|First, take a grumpy old man and a needy young \\"boy scout\\" and put them in a house.  Next, float the house into the air, with colorful balloons.   Then, let the flying house take you on a trek to an exotic location in South America.   Now, throw in talking dogs, a really huge bird, and an evil villain.      That's the basic plotline for this great animated family film.    The blu-ray has excellent video clarity and audio fidelity.
0307341550|5.0|I love novels and films with flawed, troubled characters at their centers, and \\"Sharp Objects\\" fits right into that mold.  All of the characters feel absolutely real, and the heroine is totally compelling - even (and especially) as she makes choices that make our skin crawl.  Atmosphere oozes off every page, and the dialogue and use of language wonderful.  I was riveted from the beginning.  The novel also gets deep into the mind of a \\"cutter\\" (one who deliberately cuts into their own skin), which I've never seen done with such skill.    Be ready: this is some dark material, and is not for those looking for your basic mystery.  For those who can handle - and appreciate - work that takes us to some dark sides of existence, this is not to be missed.      I have now read both of Ms. Flynn's novels, and I am hooked.  (\\"Dark Places\\" is just as great as this one.)   If this subject matter and tone appeal to you at all, then this is a must.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's phenomenal and groundbreaking. The series is brilliantly written and thought provoking to the hilt. It touches on the lost of innocence, the rage of violence, the fight for justice, self preservation, betrayal, loss, acceptance, faith, society, greed, vanity, humanity, courage, hunger, gluttony, fear, ego, arrogance, politics, corruption, vengeance, evil, good, community, trust, friendship, family, love hope and all kinds of human emotion, condition, and conflict. You can relate to her character in every aspects imaginable and actually shed light to some struggles of everyday life. The genius is that Collins was able to take the dark context and make it engaging. She has created a character of one with such revealing complexity that is hard to come by. By adding a lot of contrast and she was able to paint a story that reflects the core elements of human struggle. She brings it all to the table. A merge of classic literary themes and street smarts wit packed in a book you actually want to read. Yes! You really have to read it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was such a breathe of fresh air. For one it was not supernatural or paranormal in anyway at all. Nowadays the young adult genre is flooded with an overabundance of paranormal books (not that I don't love the majority of them) and it was GREAT to find a book about normal everyday people no powers or deep dark earth shattering, if we get together the world will cease to exist secrets. Another thing that I absolutely loved is the fact that they are college students!!!! That was different because in most young adult books they are high school students. The characters still count as young adults because they are freshman(18 and 19 years old)in college, but they are still adults because they are independent and autonomous. There are \\"sex scenes\\" in this book,beautifully written, but nothing too graphic; and the fact that they are college kids makes the fact that they are having sex alot more bearable and non perverse. Usually when you see a sex scene in a YA book its between some high school kids, but because its consenting \\"adults\\" that pay their own bills and live on their own (amen) and don't have to sneak around (amen), it's just that much better. The struggle that the main characters Pigeon and Travis have to be together feel so real. At times they will frustrate you and make you laugh and make you cry and everything in between. You will also love the supporting characters America and Shepley. They have a relationship with eachother thats to die for and a friendship with Pigeon and Travis that everyone should only wish to have. The ending was VERY satisfying and everything that I hoped for. I would love to see a continuation to this book with all four main characters in it, but it's not necessary because she ended the book perfectly. Jamie McGuire is the newest in my list of favorite authors after reading this book. I will gladly read everything else she puts out. I just wish that there was a physical copy that I could purchase to put on my overflowing bookshelf for all to see!!!!
0743571975|5.0|You really need to concentrate on what you are reading in this book and it's helpful to reread the sections until you fully understand what Charles Haanal is conveying. I love the exercises as it has really opened my mind to the possibilities that are within me. It has also helped me concentrate on the readily available answers in my subconcious to solve what seems like a difficult problem.
0739308742|3.0|IMHO, this book's reader, John Lee, is not nearly as good as his predecessor Roy Dotrice.      My main issue with Mr. Lee's flowery reading makes his characterizations come across as grossly over-acted.  It makes it hard to listen to.    Roy's reading seemed to fit with the gritty storytelling much better.    --   Furry cows moo and decompress.
B004LWZWEC|3.0|The image in this release is amazing, I mean, if you compare it to the recent Live At River Plate it's not that good, but if you compare it next to the original VHS release or the bootleg copy that's on the internet, it's pretty amazing.    So on that side, I give it 5 stars, stunning.    The set is nice, it's numbered (I'm around 5000) and it's got some great photos, booklet and a guitar pick. 5 stars over there too.    But the audio... Oh God, the audio is horrible! IT'S MONO! Let's take the basis of the AC/DC Sound: Malcolm's guitar on the Left Channel, Angus' guitar on the Right Channel. What do you get here? Everything mixed on the middle! And even Angus is louder than Malcolm, so you can't hear Malcolm when Angus is playing...    Aparently, the masters for this release were burned in a fire in the 90s or so. But however, there's still the audio from the Bonfire release, which isn't really good, but even I can work on the stereo mix and make it all right, so what about a proffesional?    Yeah sure, AC/DC's music now belongs to Sony and this release is from Warner, so maybe they couldn't use the audio from Bonfire, but if that's the case, what's the point of releasing this? People who doesn't know much about audio are getting , I'd say even robbed with this... Warner: IF YOU SO MUCH want to release this, make a deal with Sony to use the Bonfire audio, I don't know, something that would make this an excellent release like it should have been!    The band was on fire that night, it's AC/DC in their peak... the performance is amazing. I noticed that Angus pretty much was lazy with the guitar solos... he uses the same licks and scale for most of them, and if you look at Live at River Plate, he's more inspired, more original.    I won't even mention the extras since they're pretty boring and useless... not even AC/DC music on it (they even discuss some of the songs... but nothing, just some lame soundtrack that resembles nothing with AC/DC)    So, I give it 3 stars... but it could have been Amazing.    I'm glad I won this thing on a contest, I would be freaking mad if I had to pay 30 bucks for this..
1589944607|5.0|I won't repeat what every other review will tell you; by reading them, you should get a good idea about how the game plays.    Some things I do want to mention...    First off,    The educational value of this game is high. It's a deep, complex game that is easy to learn. It makes a great introduction to deeper board games for people who have never played anything more complex than Monopoly.    No two sessions are the same. I can clearly remember the events of every single session I've had with this game just because every session is so unique, they don't run together at all.    The game is fairly well balanced. I've seen people complain about balance, but there are complaints for both sides. Some people complain that Cylons always win, while others complain that humans always win. From my experience, your first few games will favor cylons while later games will favor humans... but neither side is heavily favored at any skill level.    Second off, some suggestions to increase your enjoyment of the game...    Try to rotate characters. Sure, Apollo and Starbuck seem like they're much better pilots than Boomer - but Boomer can be a very fun character to play, despite a lackluster skill draw and a terrible drawback. This is especially a good suggestion when playing with the expansion, where one character borders on overpowering. Humans may win more often if they stack the deck with the \\"best\\" characters, but the game won't be as fun.    If you've watched the show, try to roleplay your character somewhat. Roslin, for example, is probably the worst character for the president role, but would TV Roslin willingly give up the presidency to somebody who may not be working in the best interest of the fleet? No. Fight to keep your role!    Overall, I love this game. I'll play it whenever, wherever.
1401322425|5.0|This book is by far the best cookbook I have ever gotten. And I have quite a few. It is my first Jamie Oliver cookbook and I am very happy that I chose this one out of the many that he has. I chose it because I enjoyed the TV show Jamie at Home so much. Almost all of the recipes he does on the show are in the book. The book itself is beautiful, made to look like an old cookbook. There are lots of pictures, one for every recipe. Plus, which I think is awesome and really sets this book apart, the book's chapters are set up by season and each section in the chapter focuses on a vegetable in that season. And the end of each vegetable, it tells you how to grow it. There are also chapters on pickling, furred game, and feathered game, which I think is great because it really takes you back to the source of food. The book gives you a real respect for the ingredients and gives you a different view on cooking. It teaches you to put tender loving care and time into the dishes. He didn't exclude a great recipe just because it takes a long time to cook. However, there are recipes that are very quick. Mostly, the recipes are either an Italian dish or a classic English dish, both of which are lovely. I have made at least 10 of the recipes so far and each one has been absolutely amazing. I know that whichever one I try next won't let me down.
B004LWZW42|4.0|'X-Men: First Class' is the best kind of comic book film. It features fun action sequences, great dialogue, thrilling situations and (best of all) well drawn characters you can understand and want to root for!<br /><br />The plot of 'X-Men: First Class' takes the series back in time as we see young mutants Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr as they grow up from the 1940's to the 1960's. Charles is a privileged Oxford graduate who has the mutant ability to read minds. Erik is a Holocaust surviver who's hunting down the men who murdered his family, in particular Sabastian Shaw who tortured him into using his magnetic mutant abilities. The main story begins in 1962 where the U.S. government has learned that Shaw is leading a group of mutants and trying to achieve world domination. They have Charles and Erik to track down other mutants to start a team of their own to combat Shaw.<br /><br />The story of 'X-Men: First Class' plays out well in a comic book sort of way. The mixing of real events like the 'Holocaust' and the 'Cuban Missile Crisis' seem a bit odd but it gives way for some interesting period detail (and some great nods to the old 'James Bond' films!). There are a lot of moments that feel a bit rushed (the whole movie was rushed in production) and we don't get much story or connection behind Charles and Erik's super-team (or Shaw's for that matter) but the relationship and conflict between Charles and Erik really drives 'X-Men: First Class' home. They are strangers who become friends who become close as brothers. There's one powerful scene in particular where Erik and Charles share a \\"good\\" moment in Erik's memory that in any other hands than director Matthew Vaughn would seem too awkward for an action/superhero film.<br /><br />Again, while the story is great 'X-Men: First Class' wouldn't be nearly as compelling if it wasn't for outstanding performances of the three main leads. James McAvoy is one of my favorite actors and he brings warmth, humanity and humor to Charles and has you rooting for him despite his sometimes naivety. Michael Fassbender is both intense and dashing as Erik (if this is his 007 audition I think he's got the part!) and makes you more than understand his quest for revenge. Kevin Bacon seems right at home as Shaw and raises his character above the usual 'power-hungry' villain (it's a treat hearing him and Fassbender speak in multiple languages!). Jennifer Lawrence and Nicholas Hoult do good work at bringing out the relationship between Raven and Hank, but like the other actors really aren't given enough to do.<br /><br />'X-Men:First Class' is by no means a perfect film and has some obvious flaws (feels rushed, too many side-characters and tries to cram too much into a little over two hours) but it's a great piece of entertainment. With so many superhero films coming out this year it's nice to see one with some real weight to it. Highly recommended!rooting for him despite his sometimes naivety.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|It goes without saying that The Muppets work wonderful together with Michael Caine, in this film!!!    The exceptional British actor in the role of the mean and grumpy, Empenezer Scrooge!!!!    Bob Cratchit as the enjoyable frog Kermit,  The chubby Miss Piggy, could be no other than Kermit's wife.  and Robin (Kermit's nephew) with his crutch, in the role of the young (sick) Tim.    Instead of one partner, in this version, Scrooge has two, in order to make room in the film for, our beloved old men, Waldorf and Statler...    The story is... successfully narrated by Charles Dickens (played by Gonzo), together with Rizzo the rat (the only one in the film that plays his own self).    The beloved Christmas Carol of Charles Dickens, in its most unusual version...    A humorous adaptation of the story, I think the best one...
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I had my HP12C Platinum for about a year when its \\"Enter\\" key stopped working. Otherwise, it was a great calculator and I fell in love with RPN.<br /><br />So instead of purchasing an another possibly defective 12C, which costs twice as much as its competitors, I have decided to buy the HP30B, which like all HP calculators, does RPN.<br /><br />First, this calculator is somewhat on the large side. It is fairly thick as well. The buttons and the build quality seem to be better than the HP12C Platinum. The keystrokes have a very nice feel to them and the display is large and informative.<br /><br />As far as the speed of the calculations, this calculator is fast with no noticeable lag.<br /><br />The only part of this calculator that disappointed was its keyboard layout.<br /><br />I found myself entering way too many keys to make simple calculations. For example to get anything higher than a square (^2) exponent, you have to punch in the base number, input, exponent number, blue key, and the exponent key.  With HP12C, it is base number, enter, exponent number, exponent key.  Pressing that extra key in pressurized test situations is pretty annoying, especially if you need to do multiple of equations.<br /><br />The number of extra keystrokes is even worse when you have to factor by anything other than a square root. That involves base number, input, factor number, blue key, 1/x key, blue key, and exponent key. Wow and that can be really, really annoying.<br /><br />The keyboard is not laid out in an efficient manner, and that's too bad because if the keyboard layout was anything like the HP12C, I would think this might be the best financial calculator I have used (I have also used TI BA II Professional).
B002GY9F9K|5.0|My husband and I only just started watching Legend of the Seeker a couple weeks ago. We bought the first season a week ago and have already finished all 22 episodes. This show is incredible. I think the only people who don't like the show (of those who have actually seen it, as they are the only ones who can form any real opinion of it), are people who either dislike this genre or they read the books first and have unrealistic expectations.<br /><br />No, it doesn't follow the books to perfection. Far from it in some cases, perhaps. But no movie or tv show that is adapted from a book can ever follow it the way many people seem to expect. They should really be given their own place to stand, as they are two different types of media entirely. Both have great things to offer--adventure, realism in a fantasy world, and best of all the story features characters who have been very well developed, with a depth to them that makes them really come to life. Not all the acting in the show is flawless, perhaps--but that is usually the case with tv shows, which have less time to film and lower budgets to work with. But the costumes are incredible, the acting of the main characters is very well done, especially in the case of Bridget Regan, who plays the Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell. Also, filmed in New Zealand, the show offers a rich backdrop--scenery that can easily transport you back in time, and to a world like the one portrayed in the Sword of Truth series.<br /><br />Now, I myself am a writer and an actress. I am in a position to be highly critical of this show. But I love it, and my husband loves it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy, adventure, romance, magic, and a good old fashioned fight between good and evil. If you watch it, I am almost certain you will fall in love with the show and all of its characters. Even the bad guys are loveable!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Great product! Many have said what needs to be said about this , but there was one thing that I had to dig for. Thanks to another reviewer, I eventaully solved my mystery. I'm hoping this may serve as a good reference for others like me. I came this close to returning the product because I could not find The Plan. Other than a sticker on the outside of the packaging that says (basically) Razor and The Plan are included, there is no other mention that I could see on the packaging with reference to The Plan. Razor has it's own jewel case and the slip case seemed to have a gap with just enough space for another disc. Naturally, I thought I had a bad package that was missing the final disc. Luckily, I searched these reviews and found a reference to The Plan that it is in Season 4.0, Disc 4. However, that jewel case label has no mention of The Plan.    However... I did open the case and lo and behold, there was my little gem neatly tucked away on the opposite side of Disc 4. Naturally, I was happy. I just wish there was some sort of obvious clue as to where this disc was. (Unless I did miss the obvious, in which case I apologize for taking five minutes of your life that you will never get back.)    :)
0525423273|5.0|nna & the French Kiss was a good, hot read!<br />Anna is sent to a boarding school in Paris. Where she is alone. And outcast. An American. So goes to SOAP, and meets some friends there. She has a hard time at 1st. Not knowing what the menus say. Or the people mostly. She lives off bread, for the 1st couple days. Then learns the cook... speaks a little English :)<br />She meets &Eacute;tienne St. Claire. And she's instantly swooning! I mean who wouldn't? The way that he sounded in the book, was very dreamy!! But, Mr. Dreamy is taken.<br />I found my self feeling sorry for Anna. Here she is.. alone. Caught in many love triangles through out the book. In many conflicts, with her friends. I found myself wanting to help Anna!! But, Anna was a smart girl. Some times clueless. But she would eventually get it. Figure it out. St. Claire kept her confused. And he was making me mad there for a while. I was like WHY is he leading her on? Why is he with this twit Ellie? WHY WHY WHY! Anna and The French Kiss was a cute book. It was full of laughs, heartbreak, steamy kissing moments :) This book was a win/win for me!
B00004SA86|5.0|I have a particular interest in these recordings. They were not only my introduction to Mahler but to classical music. It happened after I caught some Mahler used as soundtrack on a film - no, not \\"Death In Venice\\" but a James Caan film called \\"The Gambler\\" which featured the hair raisingly eerie opening of the First. I borrowed a boxed set of the symphonies from a local library and - yes, it was this very set but on vinyl.    After this I started buying more celebrated performances by Barbirolli, Horenstein, Karajan and others - all so much more lush. I adapted to the epic romantic style and the heart on sleeve approach.    When I eventually returned to this set in CD form I was astonished by its sinewy leanness. It may be said that such is the emotive quality of Mahler that his music doesn't need any added emphasis and that seems to be Kubelik's attitude. The swift pacing conveys not only a more comprehensible structure but also a complete lack of self-indulgence. The closest equivalent to this approach may be Boulez whose clinical attitude can create a paradoxical fascinating repellence with respect to these works but Kubelik projects a more human sense of involvement, a warm chamber like intimacy, and a more visceral sense of drama.    I confidently predict that - as with Boulez - you will either love or hate these performances. Wallowing is most emphatically not on the bill. And the speed adopted throughout may appal many who are accustomed to emotive underlining and sensual lingering.    Even those antipathetic to Kubelik's stance may find him attractive in the early works, which are given a more rustic abrasiveness than usual. At the faster speeds, the trumpet fanfares and piccolo arabesques in the finale of no. 2 come across like a gloriously iridescent noise while the whole of no. 4 is like a fleet footed sylvan dance.    But I would argue that the tremendous middle period purely orchestral symphonies (5,6, & 7) and the late works also benefit from streamlining. The finale of the Sixth is particularly impressive for its tight cohesion though many will no doubt think Kubelik sacrifices detail for structure.    Of course, when it comes to any great composer, there is no definitive performance but Kubelik's approach here is remarkable for its consistency of vision. And certainly for anyone coming to classical music for the first time this box seems to me to be an ideal introduction to one of the most fascinatingly idiosyncratic creative minds of all.
0439023521|5.0|My Thoughts:<br />This book is amazing. Absolutely incredible!!! 1st you have this world. that once was North America!!!! And the controlling people in the Capitol. You have to fight for your life. Rather is killing your food, or trading things for better. Sometimes even that isn't available. I couldn't imagine.<br />Then you have the \\"Hunger Games\\"! What kind of crap is that? You have a game, a real-life game that you add humans in and sit at home, and watch them.... FIGHT FOR THERE LIVES... Killing, hunting, trying to survive through hunger, dehydration, and the fact that there in a GAME. Last one alive wins.. I mean wow. This girl Katniss volunteers herself. Taking her sisters spot. What a brave, girl she is. & she is a figther, that's for sure. Then she's up against from her district Peeta.<br />I mean i don't want to sit here and give away a bunch of spoilers. For those who haven't read it. BUT that's so hard for this book. Because its so amazing i just want to type all the pages up for you to read. NO, not really :)<br />But, in this book there's love. hate. anger. all that. every emotion you can think of you read about in this book. and you feel as well.<br />So, who does she choose??? Peeta the one she's \\"forced\\" to pretend to love, but the boy who says he's loved her since she was 5. Or does she love Gale. Then boy whom she hunts with, and spent many countless days talking, and getting food for there families...<br />Well, I DON'T KNOW.... The book is made that way.. so that you will run out to the store at 1am with you tattered pj's and flip flops on and buy Catching Fire!!!!<br />Bottom line..<br />IF YOU HAVEN'T READ HUNGER GAMES. YOU NEED TO.

Who ever is doing this is MAD. lol, and they want the world to know... there pretty little secrets!
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This is not the greatest movie ever made, but it is not the worst ever made, either.  I saw it in theater and have ordered the DVD and I will watch it again with enjoyment.  It's a decent story, the acting is at least competent, the special effects are good and overall, I would rate this a 3 1/2 star movie.  (I gave it 4 simply because Amazon doesn't have 1/2 stars).  It's a well done movie and does inspire some independent thought, since not everything is totally explained.  You could certainly do worse than this film

B0052UZIFA|1.0|The first time I lost my game progress I was on 4-1 and a phone call came in and when I started the game back up it had lost all my progress. I contacted the maker of the game and they apologized but offered no solution. I quit playing for awhile and then figured I'd give it another shot. This time on was on 2-2 and when I started the game all progress had been wiped out again. This is totally unacceptable.
1595826971|4.0|I love all things Alice. Seen the flicks, read the books, even dressed up as a gothy Alice for Halloween. It's one of those stories that can easily be twisted and reinterpreted and remain completely enjoyable. One thing I've regretted never doing though was playing the original American McGee's Alice. I'm just not that big of a gamer, I enjoy video games... just not spending hours in front of them.<br /><br />When I heard a sequel was coming out I thought I'd check out this art book to see if I might actually want to break my rule and maybe buy the game. If you're not already convinced this book will sell you. the art team on this project exudes passion and had the potential to make this game almost endless. Imaginative, colorful and at the same time horrific this macabre collection of illustrations is insane... but in a good way.<br /><br />On that note, my only beef here is that so much of the art here is from stuff that was actually not put into the game. I mean, I'm thrilled to see it but it's kind of sad to see such great stuff not make it into the game.<br /><br />If you enjoy graphic novels and art books, are an Alice aficionado and love gothic, gloomy styling you'll dig this book for sure. Enjoy!<br />**Review copy received via NetGalley.

B000K62Q3S|2.0|This is an unusual Russian release; notice the Cyrillic wring on the back. I played this on my computer (Windows7/media player), and the listed track titles are totally wrong! Really, really weird!!! After a lot of head scratching, I found that the track listing is from a different CD altogether, a 1991 compilation release called The USA collection/flashpoint???  I think any player that shows the song titles will show the same problem. I think media player gets it's info from the Allmusic website.  Fortunately, the listing on the back of the CD case is correct. The sound quality is quite good, I've even noticed small things I didn't notice before, and I've listen to this album dozens of times. Except for tracks 1 & 7, on which Mick's vocals aren't as loud as usual. They seem to be lost in the background. Unless the extra tracks are important to you, I'd pass on this (wish I would have) and get the 2002 Abkco remaster. Just my $00.02 !

B0052VUNHC|4.0|Given the amazingly strong reviews on this book, I went in hopeful that it would be as good as the reviews but also skeptical to keep from getting disappointed.  Well, this book absolutely delivered on all the positive reviews.  I downloaded this book and finished this in one sitting, staying up into the very early hours of the morning.      The story was special and unique in so many ways.  I felt as though the characters could be real and the events could actually happen given the characters' backgrounds, but at the same time there was a non-supernatural magical quality to this love story.  I was transported into their world and felt like I could even feel the emotions that the characters were going through.  Besides the strong primary characters (\\"Pigeon\\"/Abby and Travis), the secondary characters (America and Shepley) were also integral to the story.  Unlike other novels where you're either annoyed with or distracted by the secondary characters, America and Shepley really added to the story and I was interested in what their reactions would be to what was happening in the story.  I also like that while this is considered young adult, we are (a) not in high school so there's more freedom in what the characters can do, and (b) not focused on another end of world paranormal scenario typically where the girl is helpless and the guy has all the secrets/supernatural powers.  This was an honest to goodness love story in the \\"real world.\\"  And finally, part of what makes a story strong is the conflict between the characters, and the author does such a nice job of introducing situations that don't feel contrived and are sometimes even surprising.      Given everything I've written, why not 5 stars?  I guess it's due to a couple of things.  First, it felt like Travis was almost too obsessed with the girl.  I don't think it's necessarily unrealistic and the author does a nice job of having even Travis recognize this in himself, but there were a couple points in the story where I felt just a bit uncomfortable with his obsessiveness.  Also there was another moment in the book where a conflict occurred between the two main characters that kept them apart, but the reason seemed kind of flimsy and I was a bit frustrated with having to read about their being apart for seemingly no strong reason.  However, these were minor detractions from the total book.    Overall, this was a wonderful, hard-to-put-down love story that I would highly recommend.  I will definitely read other novels by Jamie McGuire.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I rented this movie and fell in love with it long before ever discovering it was based on The Taming of the Shrew.  Rather than rehash the storyline as so many reviewers are inclined to do, I will tell you that this movie is the best teen flick I've seen since Sixteen Candles, and that's saying something.  I never stopped laughing.  With a great cast of young actors, particularly Julia Stiles as major teed-off rebel Kat Stratford, sexy Aussie Heath Ledger as her very Michael Hutchence-like persuer Phil Verona, and Joseph Gordon Levitt (formerly Tommy of Third Rock From the Sun), you get good, solid performances and superb writing with clever one-liners and plenty of chemistry-driven interaction in each scene to warrant learning the dialog without trying.  This movie is witty and so much fun that I always recommend it to anyone and everyone that hasn't seen it yet.  Get a hold of this for the sheer enjoyment, because it's a total laugh riot.  The music isn't entirely my thing but, by the end, I even started kind of likeing Letters to Cleo.  Destined for classic status if it isn't already.
B000LE0TGA|5.0|In November of 1977, English art rockers Electric Light Orchestra released its seventh studio album entitled Out of the Blue originally on Jet Records in conjunction with United Artists (UA) Records. The band would eventually sue UA for the label issuing many defective copies of the album and eventually signing with CBS (now Sony Music) whom reissued OotB sometime in summer 1978 with proper sound.<br />Out of the Blue was initially to be a single album but ELO mastermind/guitarist/singer/producer/songwriter Jeff Lynne wrote so many songs that he decided to go all out and record Out of the Blue as a double album. Jeff plus keyboard player and co-arranger Richard Tandy, bass player/backing vocalist Kelly Groucutt and drummer Bev Bevan went to Musicland Studios with longtime engineer Mack to record ELO's classic contribution to rock and roll history.<br />The album features the rock radio classics and hit singles \\"Turn to Stone\\" (not the Joe Walsh rocker), \\"Sweet Talking Woman\\", \\"It's Over\\" and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\". I had heard these songs plenty of times and dug the live clips that VH1 Classic (and MTV when it was Music TeleVision) showed which were from the Live at Wembley 1978 DVD. Then, I saw the clip for the closer \\"Wild West Hero\\" and was the major reason why I bought this album. When I put it on, I realized what I had missed out on since I was only a year old when Out of the Blue was released. \\"Birmingham Blues\\" is another great number (as are the other rockers \\"Across the Border\\" and \\"Night In the City\\"). The supposed filler (\\"Starlight\\" and \\"Jungle\\") are great numbers. \\"Believe Me Now\\" and \\"Steppin' Out\\" ends the first half in grand style.<br />The Concerto For a Rainy Day (Side three of the original album) is worth the price of buying Out of the Blue alone. The haunting \\"Standing in the Rain\\" is the start to this suite which makes you seem like you are outside in the rain. \\"Big Wheels\\" is another great number which is superb on a rainy day. \\"Summer and Lightning\\" is somewhat the equal of ending the rainy day and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" ends the suite with the light before ending in a reprise of the end of Standing in the Rain. Then you have the rocker \\"Sweet is the Night\\" which rocks. Then the atmospheric instrumental \\"The Whale\\" plus the aforementioned Birmingham Blues and Wild West Hero wrap the original album up.<br />Out Of the Blue was ELO's highest US charting album hitting #4 and sold well over a million copies in the US and a great start point into ELO's music.<br />In 2007, to commemorate Out Of the Blue's 30th Anniversary, the album was re-released with a remastered version including all original artwork, complete credits and of course extra tracks like early rough of \\"Wild West Hero\\" plus an instrumental \\"Quick and the Daft\\" and closing with a new track \\"Latitude 88 North\\".<br />Highly recommended!t the equal of ending the rainy day and \\"Mr. Blue Sky\\" ends the suite with the light before ending in a reprise of the end of Standing in the Rain.

0375842209|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was nervous about reading it, because it is about the holocaust from Death's perspective and I wasn't sure I wanted to sign up for a heart-wrenching read. I did shed a few tears, but not many and I came to love the characters. It was sad, but not simply for the sake of being sad. There was also laughter, love, and hope. Death, who is somewhat tired of his job and questioning the value of humanity becomes entwined with a little German girl named Liesel and the story that results is a combination of his perspective and hers. There were times that the writing style threw me off- like when Death tells you what hasn't yet happened but shortly will occur... and the seemingly choppy storyline, but if the reader just sits back, everything will eventually make sense and all the events will be explained. I definitely recommend this book, the storyline is new and the characters are lovably human.
B003W77SAS|5.0|In June of 1979, English art rockers Electric Light Orchestra a/k/a/ ELO released their album Discovery.<br />Following the enormous success of the epic double album Out Of the Blue (and its subsequent tour to support the album), the members of ELO (which comprised of guitarist/singer/chief songwriter/producer Jeff Lynne, bass player/backing singer extraordinaire (the late) Kelly Groucutt, keyboard player/arranger Richard Tandy and drummer Bev Bevan), sans the violinist and cello players, returned to Musicland Studios in Munich with longtime engineer Mack to record the album Discovery a/k/a DISCO VERY! Would this album be an excellent followup to a masterpiece or would it be the disco sellout many claim it. Read on and find out, as I did when I bought the CD in August of 2004.<br />The album opens with synthesizer effects which then segues into the first of the album's two US Top 10 hits with the opening disco rocker \\"Shine a Little Love\\". Next is the excellent the Roy Orbison sounding Top 40 hit single entitled \\"Confusion\\". We follow with \\"Need Her Love\\" which is a nice ballad with some great playing from the band. The first half ends with \\"The Ballad of Horace Wimp\\" which tells the tale of a hapless lad who winds up falling for the girl of his dreams. The falsetto chorus was sung by Groucutt while Lynne does the verses.<br />Side Two of the original album kicked off with the disco sounding \\"Last Train to London\\" which was another US Top 40 hit for the band. Next is a ballad out of \\"Midnight Blue\\" which is another excellent ballad we came to expect from ELO. We then rock out with the synthesizer drenched rocker \\"On the Run\\" which chugs along then slows down for the string induced ending. We then slow down for the mid-tempo track entitled \\"Wishing\\" which had a nice piano solo from Richard Tandy. We close the album with the anthemic rocker \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" which became ELO's biggest North American hit single reaching the US Top 5 in the summer of 1979. In fact, the part where it sounds like they go \\"don't bring me down Bruce\\" is actually saying \\"GRUS\\" which is German for \\"GREETINGS\\".<br />The Discovery album would go on to be ELO's biggest seller in the US with 2 million copies sold to date (the first million sold was in 1979 alone) and a #5 chart position (went to #1 in the band's native UK) despite the fact there was no concert tour to support the album. Instead, the band did a video album of videos for all of the tracks (which got airplay on The Midnight Special and Don Kirshner's Rock Concert). Despite its success, some fans have called Discovery ELO's kiss of death.<br />In 2001, the album was re-released in a digitally remastered CD with a number of bonus tracks, one of which was the Del Shannon-esque number \\"Little Town Flirt\\" which is a great song.<br />Highly recommended!ere it sounds like they go \\"don't bring me down Bruce\\" is actually saying \\"GRUS\\" which is German for \\"GREETINGS\\".

You could brush up on terminology with this book I suppose.  Could also be useful if you take a class on the subject or give a class or write some tools that perform the described code changes.  Caveat lector I only read small part of the book so far, I'll post an update if the books turns out contrary to my review.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|Where the Light Is - Live in Los Angeles, has made me a John Mayer believer... this man can really scorch a guitar!  I had no idea that he was such a talented guitar player and showman.  The three distinct acts during this concert keeps your interest and wanting more,  A great addition to anyone's Blu-ray concert library!
0316069353|2.0|Spoiler alert! If you liked the outcome of the OJ trial (the first one), you'll love this book. Most of this book is tedious trial testimony where Haller shows how brilliant he is and how he's outfoxed the prosecution at every turn. After a while, I started skipping past pages of boring, inconsequential trial dialogue. Like watching every minute of Court TV.   Virtually the entire book is about how Mickey Haller is way smarter than the prosecutor, we get it, and if he has to compromise ethics to twist the justice system, well, think Johnny Cochran. Somehow we are expected to believe uber-smart, smug, narcissistic Haller has managed to out think everyone to only find out in the end he was the fool, suspends belief. Totally unsatisfying book. I liked arrogant Micky Haller better when he's on the same side as Harry Bosch.
B001POX73C|5.0|Love this book.  Read it first in 6th grade.  Laughed so hard I cried.  Love the characters, the humor and the dignity in spite of everything.  Kitty anf Freddy are better every time ~ Georgette Heyer's characters are real and I love to visit them in her books.

0345528581|5.0|I purchased the Kindle version of this book and after having read it I cancelled my gym membership. I never realized the variety and effectiveness of body weight exercises. In this well written book he takes you through 100 plus exercises (not just many variations of certain exercises but many I had never heard of). After following the beginner and intermediate programs for two months I have seen and recorded significant improvements. Since starting the number of reps, strength, balance and weight have been bettered. Also I feel more able and have less aches and pains than I ever did lifting weights- I'm not trying to become Arnold Swartz but my real work strength and muscle size have increased. Overall well worth the price. I would also recommend Convict Condition by Paul Wade which is good for a few of the harder body weight feats.  Definitely the most complete and well written body weight book I have read. Compared with other books on the market this is more easily read (least repetitive and more entertaining- Hu yah!).

B0045U9WPU|5.0|This story is light on the sci-fi, not a very complex dystopian future.  But the way the story is told, the romance, is so beautifully done.  It made me remember what love at 17 felt like.  It's amazing that such romance can be written about without seeming schmaltzy or silly, but noble.  I really, really enjoyed this, and I hardly ever write a total 5 star review.  It's also thrilling to me personally that the author is a graduate of my own school, the University of Chicago. Go Maroons! ;-)
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Excellent movie with better video quality than I'd seen in other DVD's of NBNW.  However, I really purchased it for the behind the scenes segment, which was very well done with Eva Marie Saint as the narrator. If you haven't seen the movie, do not watch the special features first.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|Dave and the guys just keep getting better, without having to sacrifice their sound for marketing purposes or radio play.  This album is amazing.  The guys compromise with nothing, and the end product is a brilliant, hard rock album.  My only complaint is that I bought the digital version a few days ago at full price, and today amazon is selling it for $3.99.  Oh well, very much worth the full price.  Dave, take my money and make more astounding music!
B004NCLKJG|5.0|Berislav Klobucar was one of the greatest opera conductors of the twentieth century.  How anyone can consider him dull can only be attributed to a lack of listening experience.  His interpretation is similar to Leinsdorf's which is to say nearly definitive.  The cast is as close to ideal as possible.  One of the best MET broadcasts.  Gives you an idea what things were like before the Levine's stranglehold on the choice productions began.  Hopefully he'll retire soon and quality conductors will appear more frequently.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|I was originally gonna rent the movie to watch but instead I bought it. I dont regret it either. It is fun to watch and I really liked it. If you are an anime lover like me, I recommend you watch this. You will surely not be dissapointed!! :)
0062060554|4.0|I read the free summary for this book and I was hooked from the word go.    The story is written in the form of a diary of a woman who loses her memory each day. She seems to have lost memory of the last 20 odd years of her life and lives in constant confusion and mistrust. The story tells the tale of how she progresses from one day in search of her lost memories    What I loved about the book was the first hand telling of a woman in this condition which is told superbly by the writer.     On reading the entire book, one finds a couple of inconsistencies and logical impossibilities but they dont take away from the superb narrative or the build up of the story.    This is one book that I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves thrillers!

142314189X|4.0|I read this series and thougt it wasn't to bad. I have a 14yr old brother who isn't a big fan of reading and my christmas gift to him last year was a book series. He was kinda bummed at first, but when I gave him this series as an option he jumped at it. The product was delivered in a timely manner just as promised. It was still wrapped in plastic and was a hard back boxed set. Overall I am satisfied with this product and so was he. :)
B002G1YPH0|5.0|PROS: Cools very well. Easy install. This is my first computer build and had no difficulty assembling it(Ended up doing it twice...see cons). Fan is quiet. I coupled mine with a Gelid 120mm 5000 RPM fan(see cons). This thing is huge(also a con) and it removes a ton of heat! Great cooling for the price.<br /><br />CONS: Fan comes already set up with included fan \\"pushing\\" air. If you buy a better fan you will want it pushing and have to remove the mount, and rubber tabs and re-install. The vibration tabs do use good glue and can be easily stuck back on. But having to do this as well as re-install the cooler(thermal paste and all) to upwards exhaust(instead of front/back) so the fan wouldn't block my nearest RAM slot made it not 100% a breeze.<br /><br />Almost went with the V6 or V8...I'm VERY satisfied with my selection. Measures around 6 inches. Fits fine in my CM690 Centurion.
031603441X|5.0|We all know Keef is cool, but I bet you didn't know how smart he is.  He has a boozy, stream-of-consciousness way of speaking (and this book feels very much like someone just taped him talking and transcribed it), but don't be fooled.  This is a man who's lived through some of the most tumultuous times of Western civilization, and he's been taking notes the whole time.  His insight into the relationship between music and culture is startling.  Read it slowly.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.<br /><br />The opening song \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James (\\"take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will\\", sounds nice doesn't it?). \\"Fade to Black\\" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day.\\"Trapped Under Ice\\", \\"Escape\\" and \\"Creeping Death\\" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live.\\"The Call of Ktulu\\" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.<br /><br />Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental \\"The Call of Ktulu\\". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.<br /><br />Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this \\"Ride\\" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.total Metal album, I very much enjoy this \\"Ride\\" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|First let me say I did feel somewhat obligated to read this because of me reading Something Borrowed. Next let me say, this is defiantely my new favorite book.

If you don't read this book, you're not only missing out on a fantastic book, but a great experience as well.
B000M341QE|5.0|I just don't know whether to love Scorcese or to hate him.  Over the years, he has produced some brilliant stuff.  And at the same time, he has produced some not-so-brilliant stuff.  However, he has a few gems that really stand out.  Movies like Raging Bull, Casino, and one of my all time favorites, Goodfellas truly defined Scorcese's career.  But it seems as if Scorcese just can't find a niche.  But perhaps that is his plan all along.    The Departed is a true classic in the genre of film noir dramas.  It truly depicts three loners bucking against the system in quite unique ways in order to make names for themselves.  And even though the movie pits these three individuals against each other, as a viewer, I had a hard time deciding which guy to root for.      I loved the performances all around.  In particular, though, Jack Nicholson portrayed a crime boss in a way that is slightly different than the way we are used to seeing the crime boss depicted.  That's why I love his character so much.  We are used to seeing mobsters with a sense of morality that they must fulfill but end up being undone in the classic Shakespearean sense because of their own fatal flaws.  However, the true failure in Nicholson's character is the fact that he has no morality, and that is what makes his character so brilliant.  I also love the fact that Scorcese gave Nicholson a great amount of artistic leeway in his scenes in order to truly develop his character.    Kudos all around for this one, as I truly think that Scorcese outdid himself.  Only time will tell if I love this movie as much as I still loved Goodfellas ten years later, but rest assured I'll be adding this one to my DVD library.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|Okay, first off this movie isn't that bad. The acting is okay and the special effects are pretty good. There really isn't any real plot to the movie except that aliens are invading the planet(think Independence Day). The action of the movie and battle sequences between the marines and the aliens are straight up Blackdown (if you've ever seen that movie). It's not a bad movie to watch once just to say you've seen it, but it definitly is no blockbuster. If you were a fan of Blackhawk Down or Independence Day, then you'll love this movie. I personally think that those type of movies fall in the category of \\" Yeah, I've seen it and it was alright\\". Bottomline, just another movie looking to cash in on action, aliens, and violence alone.
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|No CD since Ray Charles stopped recording has captivated me or given me as much pure joy as Hugh Laurie's \\"Let Them Talk.\\" If this doesn't lift your mood and make you wanna move & shout, then make sure you still have a pulse!  Haven't been able to stop listening and talking about it since it arrived at my door from Amazon.  It gets better with each play.  Laurie tells interesting musical stories of life and love in a time past, and a time I believe he may have begun to revive.  The stride piano style, interlaced with authentic gospel chords, are reminiscent of Charles' genius and the Jelly Roll Morton-Fats Waller eras.  Add Laurie's sensitive guitar playing to the superb musicianship of the other artists--vocal and instrumental--and you have a tour-de-force that's both  exciting and deeply affecting.  This is a must-have CD I believe is on its way to becoming a classic in the blues genre--ca. 21st century--on at least 2 continents.  \\"Let Them Talk\\" is a confection -- a compilation of sweets and surprises from the very first piano note of \\"St. James Infirmary\\" to the very last note in Laurie's soulful vocal rendering of the signature tune.  The title,  \\"Let Them Talk.\\" is prophetic: this CD has already ignited lots of happy talk!  So jump and shout, laugh and clap your hands, or just listen quietly and savor every delicious note.

0316017930|3.0|I've read the Outliers with a great expectation, I finally had found the book that talked about the famous \\"10.000 hours\\" theory.    It is interesting, although not convincing, and the main reason is that myself as a comedian, can assure you that the talent is what indeed makes the difference on this \\"success\\" chain. And the amount of talent you have (everybody is talented in some areas) it is also a final value. What depends of you is how much you work to develop it (because you never know how much talented you are if you do not try for a long time).    The Outliers make a good effort on show interesting facts about the amount of effort that is needed to some to achieve excellence, but don't do any effort at all trying to prove that this theory is wrong; and it is, as you will see in history many cases that at the contrary of what he states, two people with the same amount of hours could have very different results, and one reason is the genetics, the inner talent and also, but not less important, the mindset of this person (they way this person thinks, realistic or more pessimistic).    Also is interesting how he shows the influence the \\"context\\" on a individual has to \\"shape\\" their opportunities, what also is obvious, how a poor person can have the same opportunities as the others?    The main point he makes is: the success is a sum of advantages that you gain that will lead you finally on the top, but, and it is a big BUT, this only can happen if you are really talented.    Also the real history of Bill Gates? It is not told on the book, as Bill Gates bought DOS for 50.000 bucks and later labelled MS-DOS, making his way on IBM who left for him the royalties of the software (the money is on machines not on software, the IBM guys said to Bill), also how Bill copied Macintosh OS to latter call it Windows... Do you need 10.000 hours to do this? No, this is a born talent, the guy knew how to achieve things, and this is a inner talent, he could see the opportunities.Also studies had shown over and over that people with a high IQ have advantage on every situation in life, at the contrary of what he states, that makes you feel better for not \\"having a IQ of 150\\" :) Sorry but it is not true, it would be in fact better for all to have an higher IQ, but we must (and this is what he doesn't tell you) learn to live with our limitations and DO THE BEST WITH IT, nothing more.    But the main question is, who needs to be an outtlier? We are living in a culture that promises happiness (because you have fame and fortune) for those who reach a performance level that only some can reach (The Beatles for example), but, if you read the book \\"Flow\\" from  Mihály Csíkszentmihályi, you will see that any person can experience happiness (in the right circumstances I must say), and no matter if you are a beginner or Michael Jordan, the experience is the same!    We always listen that we should \\"enjoy the ride\\" not to think on the final goal, but we in one way or another, as society, continue to developing this sense of \\"only them are real happy pepople\\", and off course we are always trying to see what they \\"did\\" to get there.    Outliers is interesting if you want to see one side of the coin (the context side), not the whole \\"success\\" process, and off course, he won't mention that you don't need it to be happy (if he did, you wouldn't buy his book :) ).    Buy Flow instead, a scientific book (not so easy readable but very consistent) that will show you that happiness is not something that \\"happens\\", instead you have to fight for it, and he shows how you can do it (fight for it), is not the typical \\"self-help tell me what I want to hear\\" book, but very, very useful.    I recommend you to read this book just to have a good time reading interesting stories that only tell one side of the story.    The fact that he only tells one side of the story doesn't imply that the book is not interesting, (it is).    Regards
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Good horse tale. It's based on a true story, and unlike in most Disney films, the mom doesn't die.<br /><br />The acting was really good--especially John Malkovich.  I usually don't like him as an actor because the characters he plays are nearly always irritating. So is this character: he's a curmudgeon, but with a soft center.<br /><br />The story was well-written and the dramatic tension held my interest without stressing me out. The sets were great.<br /><br />And did I mention the horse? Whoever played Secretariat was a good looking pony.<br /><br />I gave this three stars only because, as a family film that doesn't aspire to anything greater than being a fun movie, it doesn't move into the \\"classic animal film\\" realm ( Old Yeller, Lassie Come Home, etc.) Can I say that it was a five star for a three-star category film?<br /><br />It's a good family movie night choice for all ages, and you will probably cry before the end. Just a warning.

0007294662|2.0|I'm fortunate to have attended Edward Tufte's great lecture on the visual presentation of statistical information, and so I approach any chart as a skeptic.<br /><br />First off, this IS the same book as [[ASIN:0061748366 The Visual Miscellaneum: A Colorful Guide to the World's Most Consequential Trivia]] - you don't need to buy both.<br /><br />The positive:<br /><br />Elegantly designed, beautifully presented graphics, satisfies Tufte's first rule: \\"have a compelling story to tell with your data\\" (bad paraphrase, I'm sure). My book has NONE of the defects other reviewers describe (ink splats in EU version, no labels on some charts in US version).<br /><br />The negative:<br /><br />any reader who spends a little time with a ruler and a calculator analyzing the \\"Billion Dollar-o-gram\\" (p. 10) will wonder how many of the other charts in the book are fabrications. Seriously. $300 Billion isn't anything like 4.5 x $97 Billion, yet that's what the comparative areas in this chart suggest. What kills me is that the chart would've been just as interesting and MORE compelling if it was accurate. There's off-the-shelf treemap software that will generate such a diagram automatically AND accurately.<br /><br />I had my questions about the validity of some of the charts my first time through, but other Amazon reviewers' questioning of their accuracy in [[ASIN:0061748366 The Visual Miscellaneum: A Colorful Guide to the World's Most Consequential Trivia]] made me look for myself.<br /><br />I have no way to check some of the other charts (which occasionally lapse into what Tufte calls \\"chart-junk\\") - as they're irregular figures, and difficult to compare by area. Suffice it to say that the accuracy problems with the billion-dollar-o-gram place the rest of the charts in the book under a cloud of suspicion as well.<br /><br />When you present data, you're putting your own reputation on the line. You MUST present data accurately, if you're going to present your data as truth.
B000002U94|5.0|On Segers website there is a place to vote for this CD vs Live Bullet as his best live CD.  Bullet wins about 75% to 25%.  I'm with the minority in liking this one better even though they are both very good.  This one is recorded better, probably because it was 5-6 six years after Bullet.  I think you need both for a great selection of Seger classics!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and am glad to introduce it to my daughter. The extra song \\"Human Again\\" made it special as well. Classic film that all people should watch.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar for this role.    Other than that, my brain was a little squirmy after sitting through Black Swan.    Portman plays Nina who has been dancing ballet for quite a long time. Her troupe is going to put on a \\"fresh take\\" version of Swan Lake and she has been chosen to star as The Swan Queen. This role is actually two as she will be the White and Black swans.    The biggest trip of this film is that you don't ever really know what is real and what is inside Nina's mind. (She goes a little trippy with the stress of starring in such a huge production)    Her mother is a nag, she tends to be a little OCD, Nina is majorly paranoid that a new dancer is there to take her place and all the while she needs to find some dark aspect within herself to dance the Black Swan.    This rings out Independent Film all the way through the shoot. So if you are into that kind of feel, this will be one of your favorite movies. If you like stories where you will sit and think about the story long after the credits, you will want to talk about this with everyone you text.    Beware as there are some strong sexual scenes and other uncomfortable moments. I'm thinking of the hangnail part and the file-through-the-face scene.    Dark, disturbing and very artistic.    My favorite part was the very end when we finally get to see the dance of the Black Swan.
0345529057|5.0|The books are a great read, and they are being sold at a good price. Even with next day shipping they are cheaper than the kindle version.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|The pros: Colourful, cute, USB port for transferring pictures, great for little hands, functioning camera, unique design.    The cons: Picture quality poor; will trigger fights among the kids unless they all have one!    I purchased one each for my godson and niece, for their third birthday, and both enjoy theirs tremendously. Their fathers are almost as enthusiastic over these cameras as they were; daddy got to play with them first! Their mothers are compiling online albums of the pictures they took. Something for them to look back on; it is so lovely to see what catches a child's eye. There was a wedding picture of my sister and brother in law taken by their 3 year old (from a great distance down because she was so short!) and for some reason that brought a tear to my eye. You could also find hidden spots of talent, and gain a window into your child's mind; his likes and dislikes and what interests him.     I would highly recommend these cameras for function, beauty & its unique qualities. Even though the picture quality wasn't great, you really can't expect too much out of what is essentially a toy for a toddler. The pictures were acceptable if you are not expecting DSLR quality. Buy this!
B003Y5H556|4.0|Well I loved it.  The retelling of an old story.  I wasn't expecting   the romance but I was pleased by the young actors in their roles.    Gary Oldman, as always, steals the scenes he is in.  This film   emphasizes the villian as a werewolf, and not as a mere wolf, which   pleases me.  That poor wolf is always getting a bad wrap.
0307477479|3.0|I found most of this book a pleasant enough diversion even though none of the characters [not a one!] is likeable.  Egan writes better than the average novelist out there today and is able to create engaging scenes. It's hardly Pulitzer material, however. Over 70 pages [which I skipped - what a stupid gimmick] is a messy power point insertion; by the time you turn to the last chapter after that chunk of the novel, you don't really remember who the characters are  Egan reintroduces. In that sense, the novel kind of fizzles out when you were looking for a punchy ending to pull together the themes.  Basically disappointing and puzzled as to how a book like this wins so many prizes!
B0034G4ORM|4.0|Two thumbs up.  Right from the previews it was all it was advertising.  Loved another strong heroine in uniform, along with all the heroes.    Yeah, we've seen the premise before, but so what, highly entertaining,   and the U. S. of A. kicked some alien butt.  Even this Canadian gal   loves that!!
B000058THK|5.0|I looked this set up simply in order to hear one piece; the fourth of the six pedal-piano studies op.56. (I have bought an MP3 download of all six, from disc 11 in this collection.) This short piece is one of the loveliest things not only in Schumann's work but anywhere, and Demus's performance seems to me quite extraordinarily beautiful - no sentimentality, absolute control of the balance between the canonic lines and a perfect choice and control of tempo. Really one can't separate such a performance into separate components like this - all I can say is that Mr Demus faithfully serves the music and the result quite undoes me. The performances of the other five pieces in the set are similarly wonderful. (I don't think he is playing either Clara Schumann's two-handed arrangement, or, with a colleague, Debussy's fine two-piano version, nor do I think that he plays a pedal piano here - maybe he is - my guess is that someone else is deftly putting in the pedal part, or that he has double-tracked). If the rest of the set comes anywhere near this then I guess it's a precious document indeed.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|The iPad Camera Connection Kit is what it is. You can upload the photos from your digital camera to your iPad with this kit. This is really a handy device to use when I want to upload new photos to my Facebook profile. Simply upload the photos to your iPad by linking your camera USB cable with the kit and then use the iLoader app to post it on your profile.<br /><br />It worked great in putting up photos for a couple recent trips that I took recently. Rather than uploading 200+ pictures after I returned from the trip, I just uploaded the photos on a daily basis. Nice to share the pictures with my Facebook friends in almost real time. I will continue to take this kit on future trips for quick photo uploads.

1423339851|5.0|I read this book and immediately went to the Lee Child web page so I could get the rest of the titles for the Jack Reacher books.  I have read all of them now and am waiting for the 16th book to come out.  I ordered The Killing Floor audio so my husband could listen to it while we travel in our motorhome.  I know I will be ordering more audio books with the Jack Reacher Character.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Name of the Wind was a 5 star book in my opinion.  Wise Man's Fear continues the story and heads off in some new directions.  Having said that, it isn't as engrossing a read as the first book.  More locations means more world building descriptive text.  Some prefer this, but I'd rather see the character of a place developed in the same way that other character is revealed -- slowly and through plot development rather than through lengthy introduction.  At times, this book felt slower because of all the world building content.    Having said that it still has adventure, humour, good writing and compelling characters.  If you enjoyed the first book as much as I did, you'll be reading this one regardless of what this review (or any other) says.
0316056863|1.0|Bossy Pants by Tina Fey is probably the most overrated, overhyped, substanceless, sad piece of garbage ever to receive attention from a mass audience and will most likely be mainly enjoyed by catty, over-40 women who have not gotten over being teased as children by other children for having been completely mediocre, fugly dullards. The smart ones grow up and realize there is more to life while the others, such as Tina Fey will forever inherently be a pathetic, catty child trying to gain attention by being catty. Fey almost admits it herself in the book. She was never the funniest (nor even funny at all, as many would argue), she was just the hardest worker and had the biggest mouth. Working hard will gain you success in practically every facet of life--except in comedy. You're either funny, or you are not. Or you are Tina Fey who forces her \\"comedy\\" that she claims she learned how to do through the years down your throat. The most pathetic section of the book is the one in which she \\"responds\\" to hate mail. She practically says the same thing to every hater in different words and one cannot help but cringe at the fact that a successful woman with a child would waste time responding to idiotic hate mail in an equally idiotic, sarcastic tone more befitting an uneducated valley girl.     If you want to read this book, I would suggest you borrow it or steal it because it is absolutely not worth a goddam penny.

0062060554|5.0|Waking up every day and seeing something in the mirror that doesn't line up with what you have in your mind is terrifying.<br /><br />Having to rely on someone else to spoon feed you this information is even worse.<br /><br />This novel instantly grabs you and pulls you into this story of this woman who has been through so much and has to overcome so much. It makes it impossible to put down because once the story starts spooling out about the amnesia and the controlled reality. I was continually amazed as this story continued by how taunt the story line was and the pacing pitch perfect. This is a have to read book.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Not a huge Ry Cooder junkie, but this bit of exotic charm really hits me every time I listen to it. The percussion is great, and the electric guitars are juiced. Every tune is a groove, and mercifully, no vocals. Not for everyone, I guess.
0307716511|5.0|Sisters so close that when one goes missing the other uproots her life to figure out what went wrong.<br /><br />I found this whole novel so touching that I didn't want to put it down, but at the same time it was also thrilling because of the fact that you have to find out what has happened to Tess. And all of this is laid out in a beautiful love story between two sisters told as a letter to the dead. I found myself tearing more than once in the reading because it was so reverential while maintaining a keen edge. The focus shifts from prospective murderers to the sister's relationship without losing anything in the process. It is easily one the best novels I have encountered in the last year. It is so worth reading and sharing with someone.
B000TSUCAQ|5.0|Great book for star wars fan of any age. Easy directions for kids. Great pictures on laminated pages. Would recommend!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|So, let's be honest... Games don't really require this much power.  This thing is a tank, and seeing the 8 threads all hovering around 2% while using my computer is kinda cool.  I justified this by suggesting that I needed the power for my computational projects, but I'm not been able to really challenge it, outside of benchmarks.  It flies.  Overclocking is well documented online, and my experience mirrors that I've read online.  It is capable, and according to online benchmark value estimations, it is only a little less performance per dollar as compared to the 2500K, so I felt like it was worth it for the money I spent.  Go intel.
0446691437|5.0|I've always struggled to make art consistently.  In my teens it was easy - you just started a project and stayed up all night until the painting was complete.<br /><br />My style has changed, and each painting requires a consistent focus over many days or in a couple of cases, 18 months of work.  Keeping that consistent day-to-day production required the viewpoint given in this book of \\"Turning Pro\\".  I made a time immedately as I get home from my day job to paint for two sessions daily - on the weekends it is as I wake up.<br /><br />I also highly recommend Twyla Tharp's \\"The Creative Habit\\".  Both focus on methods that create a space in which to work, toward \\"Turning Pro\\".
B004J713JW|5.0|After watching this concert the only thing I did notice was that Billy voice seems to be out of key somewhat.  He sings in a lower more controlled voice than what sounds like on this DVD.  However, on my system the sound overall is 10 out of 10, the video is the best I have ever seen for a concert recording and Billy himself, in this scorching heat deleivered a top notch performance.  He is truly one of the best live performers of our time.  I have tired playing in 5.1 and stereo and both sound excellent, so I don't know what type of system others are playing that find the sound to be problematic.    This is an excellent DVD and one of the best I have seen in a long time.  Yes there a re a few songs missing but he cannot play every song for everyone as the concert would have to be 4 hours long.  Stay away from the boot leg versions as they are poorly done although you get to hear Billy's unedited chatting between songs whcih is pretty cool.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The knife is solid and I like the additional finger choil above the hilt for more control like shaving a stick. The handle is long enough to get a good choping action by choking down, too. Others can talk about the knife itself, though. It's a quality piece of steel.     I really like the sheath. It can be put on a belt without removing the belt, the tension is adjustable so it can be made to strap down a lanyard if you add one, and for all the adjustable and removable bits it's quiet. And like every good knife should, it comes with a thigh tie-down. It might lack carry options like upside down mounting or MOLLE type straps, but I believe a knife should be strapped to me and not to my pack (and I'm not into tactical vests). The first thing I'd do when I decide to make camp is get that pack off my back, and then I'll need my knife for camp chores so why not keep it on me? Plus, if I drop my pack in an emergency at least I still have my knife - which brings me to the little extra pouch that comes attached. It can be removed easily enough, but it's great for keeping magnesium fire steel, para cord, a button compass, and maybe a sharpener.
0061134007|5.0|This is the third book in Norwegian author Jo Nesbo's series about police detective Harry Hole, a troubled but decent guy -- sometimes the only decent guy in the room. While it's the third in the series, it's the first to be translated into English, so English readers (for now at least) this is where you begin.<br /><br />The structure of the book made following the threads difficult in the beginning, but as the threads converge, you find the technique was worthwhile. The characters are complex and intriguing, and the story, which shifts between the Norwegian military in WWII and contemporary events, is solid. While the focus is on Nazism and neo-Nazis, the implications of those beliefs and the consequences of actions 50 years in the past are profound, and lend weight to this thrilling novel. Hole is a terrific character, moral but troubled by alcoholism and loss, and I look forward to reading more of his cases.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game. very well executed. Hopefully more levels, plants, and zombies  will be added. Difficulty level could be a little higher.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I have seen many, many film versions of Jane Eyre, and this is without question the best.  Michael Fassbender is absolutely amazing as Rochester; he oozes danger, intelligence and sexuality.  Mia Wasikowska is a lovely and poignant Jane.  You can believe immediately that Rochester would fall deeply in love with this sensitive, moral, and independent young woman.  They are a perfect match.
0307887960|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing about the Dukan Diet on the Today show on NBC.  I read the entire book before starting the diet.  It is easy to follow, very clear instructions, great recipes and the diet works!  I have been on it for two weeks and lost 18 lbs.  You do not feel deprived and the book is full of suggestions and answers to frequently asked questions.  I also checked in to the online chat feature on Facebook.  Lots of information and encouragement from other folks who are following this food plan.  I see myself following this diet all the way to my true weight and then going through stabilization and consolidation phases.  That seems to be the key.  We've all been on diets, been successful, then gained the weight back, plus a pound or two (or ten!).  This plan (much like Weight Watcher's) follows you until you reach your desired weight then helps you add back foods that you haven't used during the weight loss phases.  I may come back here to Amazon after I've kept my weight off for a time and let you know how well these next two phases work.  I can firmly attest to the Attack Phase and the Cruise Phase!  Buy the book - follow the diet - you will be pleased with the results.
B0007GAEW6|4.0|Here's the thing with The Mars Volta: they are incredibly talented, and the music is amazing. However, they often try too hard to be \\"artistic\\" and that ends up with them being labeled \\"hipster prog\\", etc. Take the song \\"Miranda\\" from this album. Amazing song. But the four minutes of random ambient noise before the music comes in...what does that accomplish? Nothing. I just have to skip ahead four minutes before listening to that song. If they got rid of nonsense like that, this would be one of the best bands in the world. \\"L'via L'viaquez\\" is a masterpiece. Despite that annoyance, the music speaks for itself, and this is a great album. I just want a version with all the random 4 minute sections of white noise and sirens are cut out, so I can enjoy the actual music.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie has faced an uphill battle between the fanboys screaming to see it on screen and the non-fans asking \\"who in the world is Green Lantern?\\". Ryan Reynolds has tackled the role admirably, but I still feel Nathan Fillion would have been a better choice (though with nowhere near the box-office draw of Reynolds). The movie is one of those that rocks when the action is flying, but falters badly when the ring isn't being used.<br /><br />It starts off strong with Abin Sur facing Parallax and eventually fleeing to Earth to get his replacement. Ryan is picked up by the ring and off we go! The film is faithful to the comics for the most part, and Mark Strong is absolutely dead-on as Sinestro. They couldn't have found a better actor to take the role, even though his part in this film is fairly small. He is obviously here to set the stage for the next movie.<br /><br />Center stage and full focus here is on Hal Jordan and his move from slacker to hero. I have to give this movie MASSIVE points for what happens when Carol meets Green Lantern for the first time. Rather than this stupid \\"a tiny mask hides everything\\" idea we get from comic books, there is a wonderful confrontation that really lightens things up.<br /><br />The ring constructs are perfect for the comic book fans. Those not familiar with the character, however, may be either a little confused or distracted by them. You have to give the director points for the CGI work he allowed in here. As I said before, when Hal is in costume it's a thrill ride.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No way. Is it up to the caliber of \\"The Dark Knight\\"? Not really. But is it better than \\"Superman Returns\\"? Definitely! I would have to characterize this as a step in the right direction for DC. It's not the home run we were hoping for, but it's not a total disaster either. The sequence during the credits shows us what is to come in the next film and it was pretty much the highlight of the movie for me. Give it a shot.
B003NS4SLS|3.0|I watched this episode thanks to Amazon's streaming and it was worth the price ($0).    While there were some interesting twists in the plot, it seems as though I've seen the devices in many of the horror movies that I used to think were originals (a notion that age and experience have helped alleviate). The trapped couple fighting against a maniac, the rest of their crew of unsuspecting campers trying to figure out what's going on, a village overtaken by a combination of madness and (perhaps) hereditary insanity, and a truncated ending are not very original. Such things, to me, point to a show that is in decline or is trying to \\"reach out\\" to those who might not be familiar with the show's heritage and its plot divergence (thanks to Captain Jack) from Doctor Who.     All told, it's not a bad episode. But for me, at least, the trite cliches and absurdly predictable plot leave a lot to be desired. From its heritage I would have expected social criticism and an hour of de-tangling them from the overall structure of the story once the narrative was over. This is not the case--less than 10 minutes later I'm writing this review.    For the price of $0, it's not a bad episode, but packing a bunch of old ideas in a shiny new box doesn't impress me as it used to. I'm starting to feel like this series is more like a soap opera and less like something I'll remember after I finish this review. Perhaps it's my age, but hasn't entertainment evolved since such limited contrivances?

1936594234|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a very long time and I read ALOT.  AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!!!!  If you don't learn how to change yourself and your life with this book then you don't really want to change.  This book has changed my mind set and the way I think and look at things in just a few days of starting to read it.  I am almost done and not looking forward to the book ending.  The information I got from this book is life changing and so awesome.  I have been doing the exercises and lessons and I am a changed person.  I am happy, healthy, at peace, content, and living life large and in charge.  I am the only one in control of me and it sure does feel good.  No one can hurt you or do anything to you unless you allow them to and it is all in the way you think and see things.  Trust me and buy this book so you too can be happy, in control of your own life and thoughts, be healthy and have everything you could ever want or need.  Joseph Murphy has written a wonderful book that will inspire and motivate you to be the person you are truly meant to be which can only make you happy.  I know, I did it and am going to continue to do it for the rest of my life and only wish I had this book 53 years ago because I wasted alot of time being depressed and unhappy, unhealthy, etc. and I need not have been any of those things.  Thank you Joseph Murphy and I can't wait for another inspiring and motivational book!!
B0050PYNOY|5.0|This movie highly exceded my expectations.  It was highly original and highly entertaining.  I highly recommend it.  If you like Pineapple Express, East Bound and Down and Lord of the Rings you will love this movie.  At least that is the case for me.  Your Highness takes beautiful scenery (and people) and adds comedy up to par with Eastbound and Pineapple Express.      I don't like raunchy humor, which seems to be a complaint about the movie, and to me a lot of the comedy isn't raunchy.  I don't consider smart raunchy to be raunchy.  Having Danny McBride SPOILER cut off a minotaurs penis and wear it as a trophy only to be almost sucked on by James Francos future bride cause a horny spell was casted on her is funny!(You don't know where that's been!)  Reading it might sound raunchy but on screen it's genius and hilarious.  (Eastbound and Down is more \\"raunchy\\" than Your Highness)    Another reason why this movie is good is because it's one of the very few fantasy comedies that exist.  It doesn't make fun of the fantasy genre, it uses it.  Your Highness sets up a magical world that is a legit fantasy movie even if it wasn't a comedy.  It just so happens to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.    This also seems like the type of movie that will get funnier and funnier after every viewing.     --Spoiler-- I just hope there is a second one, I must know if the chastity belt gets removed!!!    Thanks to the creators of this movie, the actors in it, and anyone who helped in it's creation. To me it's one of greatest and most original movies I've ever seen.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was showing off my Samsung Droid Charge to a friend (who had never seen a smart phone but loves games).  When she finished playing the game, 5 year old grandaughter asked to play.<br /><br />Grandaughter, without being instructed, picked it up and started playing. Much better than my friend (also a grandmother).  Grandaughter fairly quickly went through the first 4 levels - that's when I reclaimed my phone.<br /><br />Each level gets progressively harder, so not sure how far she will go, but it is easy to replay the lower levels.<br /><br />Anyway, fun for any age.<br /><br />Update:  The triplets are now three and just discovered this app for the first time.  So far they have mastered just the first level - they have so much fun.  One plays the app; the other two fall down when the pigs building falls down.
074356619X|1.0|1.0  The Theoretical Framework:  Personally Manipulating the Cosmic Delivery  System Through the Law of Attraction<br /><br />The basic idea is that you thoughts have causal efficacy--they engage the universe by means of THE LAW OF ATTRACTION.  This law, as advocates of The Secret understand it, appears to be a hybrid of Newtonian gravitational attraction and magnetism.  The basic idea is this:  Whether you want to or not, you can (and inevitably do) make things happen in the universe because you have a mind, in which you produce thoughts--cognitions.  (For the sake of economy, when explaining what advocates of The Secret believe, I will just say `The Secret says/holds/asserts ...'.)  The Secret says that the primary field of causation--the level at which events are generated--is ultimately mental: anything that happens in the cosmos is initiated by the mind.  The Secret does not deny material reality; they are not `idealists'.  Rather they say that the mind--someone's mind, yours or mine--is the primary cause of what goes down in the cosmos.<br /><br />Why should your thought attract anything outside the mind that thinks them?  Answer: Your thoughts have special physical properties that endow them with causal efficacy:<br /><br />a) Thoughts are magnetic; they attract things, ones that are \\"like\\" the content of the thoughts; so if you think bad thoughts you get `bad' life-events or situations.<br />b) Thoughts emit a frequency, which is as physical and real as the frequency of a radio, only much more powerful (it is claimed).<br />c) The frequency of your thoughts is transmitted to the cosmos--a faceless impersonal entity that acts as the delivery system--the agent of your life-events--one that you can learn to mentally manipulate to get what you want out of life.<br />d) This impersonal cosmic entity is nevertheless \\"smart enough\\" to decode the frequency of your thoughts and to understand your thoughts well enough to determine (like Santa) whether you will get good or bad life-events.  If the content of your thoughts is `good', then, since \\"like attracts like,\\" you get `good' situations; if the content of your thoughts are `bad', well, then head for cover.<br /><br />So it's no wonder advocates of The Secret place huge emphasis on thought control and cognitive or mental visualization.  And in modern empirical psychology, for instance, in sociocognitive theory, much emphasis is placed on the functional value of thought control.  By `functional value' I mean that the skills of thought control can be used by people to better cope with the difficulties and challenges of their lives.  But thought control is part of a larger set of self-regulatory skills that you need in order to cope successfully with your internal and external environment.<br /><br />If, for instance, I want to stop feeling so anxious when I drive on congested freeways (say, in LA), then the answer is to acquire the relevant driving skills in order to better cope with the demands of this situation.  But the attempt to lather up internal self-belief in your driving abilities without supplementing this cognitive simulation (if that's what it amounts to), is resorting to mere wishful thinking, not proactive, action-positive, control over your environment.<br /><br />II.  Why You Should Not Internalize The Secret:  Increased Anxiety, Self-Blame, and the Disengagement of Your Practical Reasoning<br /><br />Serious problems with internalizing (= believing) The Secret and using it as a guide for how to run your life:<br /><br />1) Internalizing The Secret can actually inhibit effective action by inhibiting the exercise of one's practical (= means-to-end) reasoning.  Since, according to The Secret, if you concern yourself with \\"the how\\" of your goals--that is, the means by which to realize them--then you are displaying a lack of faith; what's more, in displaying a lack of faith, you are producing thoughts about what you don't have--negative thoughts--which in turn willactivate the cosmic processes that ensure you will continue to lack whatever it is that you lack.  So, The Secret, in effect encourages people to shut down their effective uses of practical means-end intelligence--a key cognitive ability that allows people to successfully adapt to and engage with their environment and thereby to exercise some personal control over the course of their lives.<br /><br />The Secret encourages a misguided and misguiding \\"subjectivism\\"--misguided because it is not empirically sound.  There is no physical law of attraction that works in the way they say.  You will not find it in eminent physicist Sir Roger Penrose's huge book listing all the known laws of physics.  Second, The Secret is misguiding because it doesn't work.  Changing your construal of a situation--say, from one where you are the victim to one where you are capable of exercising some influence in that situation--can make a WORLD of difference; however, the real changes that take place in your life as a consequence of your change in attitude are very often due to  behavioral changes made as a result of your change in attitude.  And these changes in your behavior produce real effects in a complex environment, which, reciprocally, affects you.  So it is a reciprocal causal structure between three things:<br /><br />a) you, the person, and your cognitive responses, perceptions, feelings;<br />b) your behaviour<br />c) the imponderably complex environment, both social and natural<br /><br />All these things interact reciprocally.  But The Secret seems to operate on a simplistic conceptual framework:<br /><br />a) you, and your mind (and your \\"feeling good or bad\\")<br />b) the law of attraction (engaged by your thoughts)<br />c) the cosmos and its deliver system (serving you up good/bad life-events depending on whether you've been naughty or nice in your thoughts)<br /><br />Do you really believe this is how the universe works?  In order to exercise influence over your life, you are encouraged to exercise control along ONE dimension--the mental dimension.  Your mental life controls EVERYTHING that happens--or could happen--to you.  Granted, making a change of attitude can make very significant changes in your life.  Real changes.  But intra-personal change is not necessarily inter-personal change.  In order to change your life for the better, you must exercise control over your thought life (a claim most people would acknowledge as true), but advocates of The Secret seem to be asserting something stronger.  They hold that the exercise of thought control (thinking only good thoughts) is also SUFFICIENT for altering your life-situation.  This is obviously false, but the folks advocating The Secret have to do some fancy ad hoc footwork in order to dispel the obviousness of the error.<br /><br />2) Here's an example.  If you do not experience positive life-events immediately upon regulating your thoughts in the direction of the good, then--guess what?--IT'S YOUR FAULT.  You're not believing hard enough; you're not feeling good intensely enough.  You're simply not feeling it with enough oomph or gusto to engage the law of attraction to ensure the cosmic delivery of the corresponding life-event.  Nice.  This is, in effect, a recipe for anxiety and, in addition, chronic self-blame, isn't it?  And it is totally unnecessary and ill-conceived, since we, as human beings, do not exist in a causal vacuum.  We are embedded natural organisms--special, yes, in that we have cognitive capabilities (the capacity to reflect on our goals and our functioning and to use our power of reason to decide how best to live, for instance).  As human beings, we are embedded in our environments (social and natural) and that means that NOT EVERYTHING IS UNDER OUR CONTROL.<br /><br />3) We live in a natural environment--where tsunamis occur and people die, where even very rich people get sick (Michael J Fox, Michael Douglass), as well as a social environment in which people have varied goals and ends, many of which conflict; in many cases, your personal victory means someone else has to lose (e.g., getting that university position).  The environment is an imponderably complex entity, a network of personal agents in pursuit of their varied and conflicting objectives.  Cooperation does happen--often.  And when it does, it usually requires some interpersonal skills, shared objectives and values, not merely solitary wishing or intense introspection on what one wants, however positive it may be.  You have to actually talk to persons and know how to communicate with them to get what you want, and that requires the skills of self-assertion, empathy, bilateral negotiation, persuasion, etc.  These are skills that have to be learned through experience.<br /><br />I think that the good people of The Secret (and they seem to be sensitive, well-meaning people, but I may be wrong) are not acknowledging how, in changing your attitude and construal of a situation--say, from one in which you view  yourself as a victim to instead viewing yourself as a personal agent--you exercise influence over your motivation and, consequently, your behavior.  When you change your behavior, changes are thereby made in your environment.  These alterations in the environment originate in you, the agent, and, are, in many cases the direct effects of your own action on the environment.  There is no need to suppose the cosmos stepped on your behalf in to bring about the event.  Because you did it.  It's called PERSONAL AGENCY.  Some changes in your environment cannot occur without the help of others.  But you can influence others for the sake of your own valued goals.  Why is it necessary (and how does it empower us personally?) to view our dealings with the world as the result of our manipulation of some cosmic life-event delivery system via our thought alone?<br /><br />4) Using your feelings as a radar screen.  What is wrong with listening to your emotions in order to know what you are thinking? Cognitive psychology is one of the most significant advances in modern empirical psychology of the late twentieth-century.  According to CP, our emotions and feelings are based on or determined by our thoughts (or cognitions).  Your feelings the result of what you think.  But the problem with using your feelings and somatic sensations to determine and identify what you are thinking stems from the fact that your physiological reactions underspecify what you are feeling and consequently also what you are thinking.  You can't use nausea, extreme butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, rapid heart beat to determine what you are feeling, since you might be feeling pre-test anxiety or the excitement of a hot first date.  Advocates of The Secret would not dispute this.  They embrace this.  However, they recommend that you focus on your feelings (using a simplistic index of feeling good or feeling bad) as if these feelings were enough to go on in deciding what you feel.<br /><br />5) In order to determine what you are thinking, you need to usually proceed in the reverse order.  In most cases, you need to know what your situation is and what you are thinking about your situation in order to grasp what you are feeling.  And in order to know what you're situation is, you need to direct your attention to reality that is external to your mind and consciousness--namely, to pay attention to your current social environment and `what you are' in it, and whether you have the capabilities to cope with its demands or not.  And this environmental information can't be derived by personal introspection, no matter how intense or focused it is.  This already suggests that your mental reality--that is, your internal psychic environment--is partially determined by the environment in which you are operating.  So, here's the take-home:  by focusing exclusively on your \\"feelings,\\" you are cutting yourself off from other relevant information--indeed, vitally relevant--to your self-knowledge.  Instead you need to focus on grasping your `situation' and on the various beliefs about it.  First and foremost among these are your beliefs about your abilities--your perceived self-efficacy--to cope with your situation.<br /><br />For a truth-yielding, agency-affirming and self-empowering work in sociocognitive theory, read Stanford professor Albert Bandura's, Self-Efficacy:  The Exercise of Control.  Bandura's work is empirically-tested, conceptually rigorous, and personally life-altering.to lose (e.g., getting that university position).

1400052181|4.0|I liked this book because it told me something new and interesting on two fronts. The first is a view of the cultural evolution of slaves in America. I never read about this subject presented with such freshness and unabashed candor. The second is the science about cell lines. This was the weak point in the book, but covered in enough depth for me to learn something. The book was well written but not good enough for me to read it twice.    I felt as if political correctness held this book back somewhat. For instance, Henrietta's cancer cells are so prolific that they can take over whole cultures when used in an experiment. The author hits this pretty hard but then drops the subject after suggesting that thousands of scientific studies using these cells may be tarnished.    The author also skips the obvious topic of \\"under what circumstances will exposure to these cells lead to an infection of another person?\\" In our culture, taking a pee in the park in view of other persons, unwittingly or not, often leads to a conviction and a place on the sex offendr registry. This is done without any evidence whatever that persons who view this dastardly act become meaningfully harmed in any way. Hookers with AIDS receive only the skimpiest of punishments even though they pose a huge documented public health risk and infect others willingly by taking advantage of their hormonal weakness.
B000046PVN|5.0|The Superman March is one of the most exhilarating themes ever penned.  Never mind that it sounds a lot like STAR WARS.  It makes you feel like going out there and beating up on some bad guys.  And that trombone run at the end.  WOW!  Get this for the themes in the opening title and end credits alone.  It's worth it.
0316098329|3.0|This book is a remarkable book although a highly disturbing one. Remarkable because Donoghue keeps the interest and tension going even though she is writing in the first person POV of a 5 year old child (although I was getting pretty sick of it by the end). Disturbing because of the subject matter (a woman kept prisoner for 7 years and forced to endure the repeated abuse of her kidnapper) and because I felt as if both Donoghue and the reader were being somewhat horribly voyeuristic. Donoghue cashes in (literally) on the current interest/fascination in such cases and we as the reader propagate what I think is an unhealthy interest in knowing 'everything that went on'. Writing from the POV of a 5 year old means that Donoghue can let us know the most intimate secrets - a child, in his innocence, tells the reader things the mother would never do. If Donoghue had used the POV of Ma herself then the Ma's privacy (which she so desperately craves) would be maintained as Ma could control the information getting out. But, no, her 5 year old son tells us, and he tells us everything. All control is stripped from Ma, even her POV, especially her privacy.    All this left me very uncomfortable. Donoghue profits from our vile human tendency to be voyeurs, and we as readers can indulge our nasty little habit to the hilt.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|As someone who read comics when he was little, I am really enjoying the dirth of superhero movies. Green Lantern was a fun superhero movie and I loved it. For anyone who knows anything about the Green Lantern, this was a very ambitious undertaking from a special effects point of view. The story is all about aliens, new worlds and a seemingly magical ring that can do almost anything.  Those green energy constructs that are made from the ring appeared in the comics and can come across as silly to someone who may not know that this is what a Green Lantern does.  Sorry critics if you need a make-believe story about a radioactive spider to allow you to suspend disbelief. Why not relax and enjoy the show? It is often funny to see the difference between the jaded critics' reviews and the public perception; Moviefone's ranking (public vs. critics) is abou 99% to 40%.  That's about right.<br /><br />Is the story air-tight? Of course not, it's about a superhero. But then again, neither are stories about vampires, aliens or dinosaurs brought back to life.  It's all make believe.  But then again, this is a DC Comics story as opposed to a Marvel comics story.  The two publishers are different in that Marvel spends more time focusing on the humanity and imperfections of their heroes, whereas DC focuses more on just being the hero.  The stories are more simple, but they have their place, too.  They are also both very enjoyable...if you just sit back and enjoy.<br /><br />HOWEVER....the \\"digital copy\\" allegedly included is not really a digital copy.  It is a code to access it on line.  While you can get it with your ipad, iphone, computer, etc...you cannot upload it.  So, if you are without access to wifi, forget it.  How is that a digital copy?  They lose 2 stars for that.
1557427283|5.0|This is in response to the review earlier, \\"Golden Calf Not the Ten Commandments,\\" where the reviewer takes to task the book's mistaking active voice sentences for passive. The example sentences the reviewer quoted from the book were not claimed in the book as passive.  The book was giving examples of active voice sentences and how best to write them.  The comparison between active and passive had already been concluded in the prior paragraph. The next paragraph, starting with, \\"The habitual user of the active voice...\\" marked the beginning of how to use active voice effectively.  A sentence or two later, \\"Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made lively and emphatic by subsitituing a transitive in the active voice for some such perfunctory expression as \\"there is\\" or \\"could be heard.\\"  After this examples were given as comparisons of how best to use active voice (page 18-19, 4th Edition, hardcover).<br /><br />A small, compressed handbook like this can easily appear to mix things up if you don't read it carefully.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|An unamed ghost-writer (McGregor) is given the task of rewriting the memoirs of a Blair-like ex-PM Adam Lang (Brosnan), after the previous ghost-writer committed suicide. He travels to a gloomy seaside hideaway in America (supposed to be Martha's Vineyard -- the location they filmed Jaws -- though, due to Polanksi's legal problems, it was actually filmed in Germany) to meet the politican (and his wife), and attempt to rewrite the manuscript. As he is there, though, the story breaks that Lang is to be tried for war crimes in Iraq, and as he also finds (in the effects of his predecessor) evidence that there might have been CIA involvement in Lang's ascendency to the top.     I thought this was actually excellent and can't believe the amount of 1 star reviews! (If you don't like slow films, watch something else!) The cinematography and atmosphere (lots of sombre, autumnul greys and browns, rainy beaches) and pacing were particularily impressive and reminded me somewhat of Wallander (the Branagh adaptations), but the film was also full of Polanksi's mischevious genius. I thought McGregor was compelling in the central role (it was through his characters admittance that he knew nothing about politics that helped draw me in more). Brosnan was uterlised to perfection (keeping him cleverly off camera for large portions of the film to retain an impersonal distance and power), as Adam Lang, hiding away in his designer bunker by the ocean, whilst his world fell apart. The rest of the cast were excellent too.     I suppose people will see this in different ways. I'm seeing it as someone who loves Polanski's work, but who hasn't read the book. I'd reccomend this to anyone who likes Polanksi (or also Wallander). It's nothing like Bourne (some people have mentioned it had the potential to be another Bourne) as it isn't supposed to be. It's about character and focuses on the increasing paranoia the Ghost Writer feels as his situation unfolds, on the psychological tension rather thanthe dramatic tension of being chased in different situations. Polanski doesn't achieve the heights of his own benchmark in paranoid isolation, Repulsion, but this is still a cut above your average thriller. It's a beautiful and haunting film with a strong plot and top notch acting and direction. How anyone could rate it less than three stars is simply astonishing.

B004XQO90E|5.0|Most critics and audiences find this an extremely satisfying movie.  But one common criticism is that the science in the science fiction is illogical.  Thing is, not so much.      A large number of cosmologists have recently been exploring the idea that the seemingly inexplicable nature of creation of the universe might best be explained by an infinite (not \\"large\\", but infinite) number of universes.  Where everything that could possibly happen has happened.  Two recent books about this by _very_ serious guys are Stephen Hawkings The Grand Design, and Brian Greene's The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos.  One variant of the theory has each universe splitting all the time into more universes going down different paths.    Most all people find it very difficult to wrap their brains around these concepts (which Greene acknowledges and tries bravely to overcome).  It's that difficulty which many of the negative critics have.  As well as some of the characters in the movie.    But personally, I see the most difficult bits of Source Code for critics to accept as a very clever riff on the possibilities of these theories.  There's more to the movie conceptually, and the way that the hero visits the multiple scenarios is properly described as pure magic (the major similarity between this movie and Groundhog Day).  But both the multiple scenarios and the possibilities of those scenarios are actually grounded in cutting edge science, and while it's a science that many find hard to swallow, some very serious folks are exploring it seriously.    So, if you're not a science fiction fan or a scientist, see the movie simply because it's real good.  But if you are, there's relatively little that will annoy you as unscientific, and much that will delight you.  It's top notch science fiction, and, in my opinion, it bats in 2001's league.
B003XQ2VOG|3.0|Other than \\"The Lost World,\\" the other movies in this set are OK.  The Lost World has horrible production values for being an \\"A\\" list movie.  Here are a few hilarious examples: The expedition goes to an outpost on the Amazon in the dense jungle in the middle of nowhere--and at dinnertime in the evening the actors come out in sport coats and evening wear.  The Dinosaurs are real monitor lizards outfitted with prosthetic horns and spines along the back to make them look scary, then they are filmed in slow motion rambling through what looks like a forest of broccoli spears.  The ASPCA would have had a cow because the monitor lizard/dinosaurs then proceed to tear each other to shreds.  Night scenes are filmed in broad daylight the way old TV westerns were filmed back in the 50's and 60's.  I'm sure Mystery Science Theater 3000 did an episode for this movie.

0307595862|5.0|One of my all time favorite fictional characters is Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. Jo Nesbo's Harry Hole is cut from the same cloth. This is my first Nesbo novel and I am sure to read more. Harry Hole is an Oslo policeman on the trail of a serial killer known as the \\"Snowman\\". Nesbo's writing is very reminiscent of Connelly's style - intricate plotting, and well developed characters. Hole is flawed and fighting demons. The translation was great. GREAT READ!!!

B004WJRDN2|4.0|I have four copies of this recording on CD (including DCC and Japan mini LP) and a mint Apple LP from 1970.  The sound on this remastered edition bests them all.  For almost three hours last night I spent a long time comparing all of them through speakers and then headphones.  Hands down, this is the recording to own.  The book, for me, is an equal treat.  All of these great photos and the back story regarding the release of the LP are awesome.  The down side, for me, was that the DVD documentary is nearly parroted word for word in the book (and only Sir Paul's voice, never his actual image).  And no new photos...once again, it's all straight from the book.  The only new things are the concert videos, which, as a collector, I would rather see released in their entirety, not piecemeal on each of McCartney's current and future releases.  The vintage Maybe I'm Amazed music video is the highlight with great home movies accompanying the music.  The second CD, with outtakes and live performances is very short and something that I will probably never play again.  But overall I am very pleased.  Five stars for the remastered CD and book, two stars for the second CD, four stars for the Maybe I'm Amazed video.  NOW, GIVE ME A HIGH RESOLUTION 5.1 RELEASE OF THIS RECORDING PAUL (and Band on the Run...not the DTS edition)!!!!!

B0025VLELQ|3.0|This was playing on a nearly continuous loop throughout a better part of my childhood, but as I hadn't seen it in over two decades, I was basically watching it again for the first time. It doesn't hold up magnificently and bows to a huge number of cliches from the decade's pop-friendly films, but still retains a strong sense of endearing sincerity and naivete. The back of my mind kept reminding me of how terribly hackneyed the story and characters were, but that wasn't enough to wipe the stars out of my eyes nor the grin from my face. It's a staggeringly rudimentary plot - teen going nowhere in life gets a high score in a video game, only to learn it was a secret recruiting tool for an intergalactic war - but a thorough coating in childlike whimsy and wonder, plus a few startlingly good special effects (given the era) are just enough to pull it back from the brink. Anyone younger than twenty will likely roll their eyes and snort at its simplicity, but audiences with a memory of the eighties should enjoy it for the sentimentality alone.

But with this movie I just could not help but cry like a baby. I could not control my emotions. The picture of hachi took over me even after the movie was over... My heart broke into pieces because at that moment I started thinking about all the animal abuse around the world. And I kept going back in my mind trying to picture Hachi and his 9 year journey. Please if you love animals watch it and if you don't love animals watch it anyways..this might change your mind. Right now I'm full of emotions I can't describe...we are horrible people hurting hopeless animals. Hachi will forever be in my heart...  PS: This is my moms account that's why it says betty coll!
B001JNNDE2|5.0|I laugh a little bit harder every time I sit down with this one, but can acknowledge that other viewers' enjoyment will depend entirely upon their own experiences in high school. As a proud survivor of the awkward, unpopular farm town geek club myself, though, there's a lot of familiar territory covered between the credits of this little sensation. The film itself is a conundrum; an MTV production that feels like a DIY indie picture, it successfully captures the best elements of each without getting snagged by any of the drawbacks. Napoleon and friends come off as just awkward enough to feel authentic in their small town school, while the studio's big city influence delivers a surprisingly appropriate, not-quite-star-studded soundtrack. It's at once sweet, funny, genuine and flamboyant, with a story arc that always gives me the warm fuzzies. Fellow bully targets who can laugh at their own origins will find a whole lot to like about this one, but members of the other cliques may not find themselves as enamored.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|High on my list of desert island movies, Lebowski is an endlessly rewarding modern classic that seems to yield something fresh with every screening. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi may have been able to carry this thing by themselves, staggered around a rickety old bowling lane with just a wardrobe and a copy of the Coen brothers' script, but when their performances are matched by a blindingly colorful supporting cast, a plot that swerves around like a drunken driver and the brothers' unmistakable eye for subtlety, the end result is pure magic. I could watch this three times a year and never get tired of it.

B00003CXGG|3.0|A great Romeo and Juliet story, but I don't know why there's no kissing scene between Aaliyah and Jet. It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't you kiss your love interest? Anyway, I loved the father-daughter theme 'cause it reminded me of the relationship my sisters and I have with our dad, but he wasn't shady. Romeo Must Die is a wonderful film...except the snakes on the walls made me very uncomfortable and scared. So I looked away in some scenes. I still can't understand Aaliyah's fascination with them, but different strokes for different folks. One more thing, the landscape was very beautiful and the soundtrack was terrific. Overall, wonderful actors and wonderful story so I recommend it. Without a kiss, I will not give this movie 5 stars. And because of the snakes they showed, I'll remove one more star.
B004WJRF6C|3.0|I've been waiting for the reissue of this album for some time. I actually have the vinyl of this album. I always liked this album. I was disappointed that they put this out as a two cd set when there is only enough material for one cd. This is just a way for them to charge more money. I think the two CD's together add up to less than 60 minutes. Like I said this is a good album, but quit ripping off the listeners!
0061726826|3.0|Be forewarned: there will be some spoilers in this review.    There are some books to which I have an almost visceral reaction, The Hunger Games being a good example of this.  They pull me in right from the first page, and I feel as if I'm inhabiting the world of the characters.  I love it when a book is so real, so richly drawn and textured that it seems like it's living and breathing on its own.  Alas, I did not find this book to be that kind of book.    Oliver is a good writer, so I have no quibbles with that.  Her prose is often lovely, and I enjoyed her descriptions.  One of the problems with this book, though, is that there is a lot of writing, but very little is happening.  I'm not opposed to slow books, and I typically enjoy the kind of fiction that is full of a character's reflections and thoughts, so that wasn't my problem.  What was my problem is that I felt like there was so little growth, so little change.  One moment Lena is very gung ho about the world in which she lives, and the next she isn't.  Yes, there is a device that provides her impetus for leaping right over the edge, but I just didn't find it all that believable.  I wanted to see some real growth, some serious evolution in Lena's thoughts about her world and how it was run, but I didn't find that.    I was very disappointed in the back story about Lena's mother.  Lena has such wonderful, lovely memories of her mother--and that makes her extremely eager to get the \\"cure\\"?  That just didn't add up for me.  I understood that Lena was traumatized by what she witnessed as a child, that she was afraid of what love could do, but I just didn't see how someone who seemed to love and treasure the memory of her mother as Lena did could be so completely on board with what was about to happen to her.  I really felt like her experiences as a child should have shaped her thoughts, should have colored the way in which she viewed the relationships between other husbands and wives, other children and parents.Yet, when Lena discovers the truth about what happened to her mother, she's ready to totally renounce the world of which she was previously so accepting?  That just didn't make sense to me.    On the whole, Lena is a pretty bland character.  She would have been more exciting to me if she had struggled some more over her emotions about her mother.  It's disappointing to me that a novel that gets as much press as this one has such a boring female lead.  When I think about a character like Katniss, who was infinitely more complex and who was filled with so many conflicting emotions, I can't help but be let down by a character like Lena.  And while I do think there is a sensation of awe attached to loving someone so intensely and finding that they love you back, I was just really annoyed with the whole \\"I'm nothing\\" and \\"I'm just plain\\" attitude that Lena had.  Would it be so wrong for there to be a female lead who doesn't constantly think this way?    Lastly, I was very disappointed in the world.  The setting turned the book into something more like \\"Dystopia Lite\\".  It was hard to understand what the government's beef with people loving was because it had no real discernible advantage for the government.  This, to me, is a rather large flaw.  Good dystopian fiction should always give you a feel for why the government acts as it does.  I'm not saying that this needs to be revealed in the first ten pages, but it doesn't take long before the reader can see what the government's aim in 1984 is, nor does it take long to understand the advantage of The Hunger Games to the government of Panem.  Instead, this book felt more like an alternate universe, starring a Portland that is, for all intents and purposes, exactly like the Portland we know, only with a slight twist.  Maybe this will be further developed in future installments, but I don't know how likely I am to make it that far, given that this book just didn't do all that much to draw me into the story and the world.So why did I give this book three stars?  Well, because it's a solidly decent book--but that's really all it is.  I didn't completely hate it, but nor did I feel like I just had to keep reading because I had to know what happened to the characters.  It is also obvious to me that Oliver is very talented, but I think this is a genre she would have done best to avoid.  It's a genre that doesn't strike me as a very good fit for her particular talents.
B004WESFZW|3.0|Who would have thought, 20 years ago in the \\"Good Will Hunting\\" timeframe, that Ben Affleck's career would be on the skids and Matt Damon would be a huge action star?  Damon is a superb actor who is capable of carrying virtually any material.  He carries this whole silly movie on his back, and the chemistry between him and Emily Blunt helps a lot.  You are rooting for them to be together, and they are such great characters and good actors that the story and plot bumps don't interfere too much.  The members of the AB are good villians; they are only \\"following orders,\\" and are not malicious or spiteful.  They believe they are right and are just doing a job.  As antagonists, they are more complicated than typical movie bad guys.<br /><br />This isn't an SF or fantasy movie so much as religious allegory; an exploration of the nature of the purported plan that some people believe a deity has for us.  There is a dark underbelly of such a plan, meaning that you have no free will, and if you manage to somehow exercise it then the minions of that deity have to change you to get you back on the predetermined plan.  Your belief in predestination may affect your level of enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it's OK; it's competently done; and you'll have forgotten you ever saw it a month later.  Not a bad rent if it's all that's left at the store or in the vending machine on a Saturday night.
B0051BLT4O|4.0|I'm about halfway through the kindle edition (on my iPad), and noticed several of the pictures did not match the captions provided. So far, I really like the book. All the information is well written and extremely useful and easy to read. I wonder if this only happens in the digital edition. I would be interested to hear if anyone else with a kindle version has noticed the same thing. If this could be corrected I would definitely update from 4 to 5 stars.
B00111L0MY|4.0|This movie is really good.  Some scenes will have you on the edge of your seat.  The movie takes a lot of twists and turns.  It's a movie with an edge!  Ben Affleck directed the movie and does a great job.  His brother Casey is one of the lead actors is terrific.  It's a really good story about a little girl who's missing.
B00000F14B|3.0|It's a good movie, but I bought it at 6:30 on June 5, 2011 and the next day at 5:00 I wanted to resume it and it didn't work. A good movie but needs a little improvement.
1594481717|4.0|As someone who's watched product development change materially over the last twenty years, in both the US and Asia, I believe this author has really nailed what's going.  We live in an era of abundance, the rise of Asia's importance and ever improving tools.  These mean that as westerners, particularly Americans, its a golden age for inventors or other creative types (Right Brainers in his vernacular) and its pretty gloomy for those looking to just put one foot in front of the other.  He gives some suggestions for positioning yourself, and some have criticized him for not enough of that in this book, but my view is that's really largely outside of the scope of this book.  Most of us know what's the routine and structured tasks that are likely to be outsourced and which are the takes that require more human touch, creativity, etc.<br /><br />Where this book is helpful is providing context to the changes underway that many may not fully grasp.  As our country bemoans the loss of our math and science proficiency, we've not paid enough attention to the growing importance of the soft skills that will, to a large degree, trump those skills.  We need to emphasize entrepreneurship, working with global teams, understanding the increasingly small world we live in.<br /><br />The one fault I have with this book is that it does seem to sometimes imply an either or proposition.  To a large extent, the phenomenon of automation, in the form of improved software tools for many many professions mean that even artists and designers will be doing vastly more technical work.  So while it may be true that engineers are threatened unless they become more creative and better designers, its also the case that designers must become better engineers, else they will be usurped by more technically minded folks that can \\"do it all\\" at vastly greater efficiency.  This means more than artists have to know how to work computers, it does mean they will often need a better understanding of things that teammates probably did in the recent past.  In other words, its not that math and science have become less important to our kids, its just that they need to understand the math and science at a fundamental level and viewed through the lens of the tools they will be using.robably did in the recent past.

0307387178|5.0|I can't say a ton because I read this book a few years ago. But I can say this: this book is phenomenal and makes you really question the gray line between your instincts to break out of your day-to-day modern day routine and that same day-to-day routine.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|great movie - but with the 2nd disc -not much to add, min deleted scenes and some tech stuff -not really worth it (if the cost were higher)
B003ASLJRW|5.0|\\"Pale Rider\\" is a well acted, complex film.  There is a strong reference to Biblical justice woven into the plot. Additionally, Eastwood's character is an enigma in the story.  At times he seems spiritual and almost superhuman, at other times the \\"Preacher\\" appears \\"sinful\\" and all too human.  I appreciated the complexity of the plot and characters.  If you enjoy westerns, \\"Pale Rider\\" is a must see film.
0071762345|5.0|For a generation of business owners who have no idea how social media even works, let alone how to use it for their businesses, this book is great!  Dave Kerpen is the CEO of Likebale Media, one of the leading companies in the social media industry and he definitely knows what he is talking about.  He gives away expert advice on how to use Facebook in order to promote your business by creating a strategy on getting the most \\"likes.\\"  This book is gold to anyone who is looking to break into the social media world and doesn't quite get it or know what they're doing just yet.  Definitely give it a read!

0062060554|4.0|Christine Lucas wakes up every day with no recollection of the past twenty years of her life. She has no idea that the man sleeping next to her is her husband, Ben, or that she's now in her forties. Each morning her doctor calls to remind her of the journal she keeps to record her memories in, so that she can re-acclimate to her life. Aside from the tattoos, this story is nearly a mirror image of the movie Memento. Fortunately, it's one of my favorites, so tolerating the many parallels in this book was not difficult; it just felt repetitive and more predictable than if I'd not seen the movie.<br /><br />Watson does a great job dulling the personality of Christine and making her amnesia believable, but there were definitely some holes in the plot regarding the plausibility of certain situations - taking her lack of memory into account. Overall though, it was a great story. Had I not seen Memento, I would have given this book 5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brittany for Book Sake.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|This is sort of a Twilight rip-off, but it does have a few good things going for it:  Amanda S.  Production design  A twist or two    Beyond that, the story is not that great, and it looks better than it actually is.  Oldman is way over the top as well.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|I remember this movie from when I was younger. I always loved it. It's a nice \\"family\\" movie. No gore, grit, shooting, blasting, speeding, $ex or anything in this movie. Just good classic entertainment from back in the day.
B004UHF51S|5.0|What a fantastic, incredible work of musical magic, and I feel qualified to say that as I have everything he's ever recorded. I LOVE Michael Franks!  For me, Time Together ranks right up there with Sleeping Gypsy and Tiger in the Rain. Not only has his music delighted me for the last 35 years, it has introduced me to the amazing artists he teams up with like Larry Carlton, David Sanborn, Romero Lumambo, Chuck Loeb and so many others.  There's really nothing more that I can say that hasn't been said so eloquently in other reviews. I love reading what other Michael lovers feel about his music because I feel connected to this small segment of our population that is so fortunate to appreciate him and \\"get\\" him. We're kindred spirits. Buy this album, grab a loved one and samba under the summer stars.
B002ZG980U|5.0|This is an awesome movie with a complex storyline. If you are the kind of person that does not want to watch a movie carefully from start to finish, it's probably not the movie for you. Most people say they have had to watch it several times to really get a good handle on it. However, it is totally worth it. The concept is amazing and the special effects are great. It's definitely a movie that qualifies as an intellectual thriller. Love it and had to add it to my video library.
