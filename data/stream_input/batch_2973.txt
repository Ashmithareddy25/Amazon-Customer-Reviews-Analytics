0446580848|5.0|I don't think I was 5 pages into chapter one (following the prologue) that I was smiling and laughing.  John Corey is a great protagonist and keeps all his stories exciting.  But that's true of all of Nelson DeMille's characters.  DeMille is, by far, my all time favorite author.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Loved this book.  Told his story in a very meaningful way - characters were well-developed.  Would recommend it to book clubs for a read and discussion.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The acceptance speech at the end very poignantly and hopefully reveals the importance of elsewhere and memory. A novel that stays with you, and still has something to give to adults as well as children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My sons loves playing this game on the kindle.  Keeps him entertained for hours.  Works great on far road trips.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|It was a great year - miss Mark & Lexie - the DVDs played well - what else can I say?
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|I though it was okay. I bought it so I could watch through the series because the library didn't have this one. It is cheap and good for that. I didn't care much for the movie itself.

B00F91H666|4.0|Well I would have gave it 5 if brad pit wasn't in it, he just doesn't do action very well, plus he is anti gun advocate and here he is shooting up stuff... Ironic
B004GJXQ20|5.0|As books are, this is even better than the TV series.  Loving every page and finding it more understandable for watching the show.

B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|A nice stress fee game that is easy to understand and play. I would recommend it either for adults or children.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I bought it after I say the movie...and of course it was 10 times better! The movie didn't follow it at all. I loved the characters and the detail she put into the new world of fantasy. After I was done I bought all the other books.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|This album was everything we have come to expect from Drake. The absence of Wayne was noticed but his presence wasn't needed. Jay Z annihilated Pound Cake and we see that Drake does have an R&B singer bone in his body. Good album.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This is a very good learning language app. The lessons are challenging and really helpful. If I had discovered this app before I may not have purchased Rosetta stone. I can't believe something so good is free.
B0057UA4CW|5.0|It´s such a perfect film that i must have it in my collection, also one of the most beautiful films ever created, and also this movie is impossible to buy here in Mexico in this format. if you´re a Kubrick´s Fan you must have this film in your hands.<br />So thanks to Amazon for help and send me this item in time and perfect conditions all across USA  to Mexico
B007VI4TKQ|4.0|If your into the si-fi out, there movies this one was worth it. I had this on DVD for years and wanted to upgrade to the bluray. For the time the effects were awesome, the plot was the same as the book and maybe a bit under par in acting. Over all i seen this movie a dozen times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun wow totally love this game amazing minions are awesome don't you think living it . Play it every day HahahahaHahaha
B008KOTNVA|4.0|I am very impressed with the Variety of the included bits; most of which have proved considerably helpful. I build and fix computers  quite frequently and the sizes of the bits are great, not to mention the usefulness of the pentalobes. Although, I am quite unimpressed with the build quality.. The interior of the case is constructed of incredibly cheap and flimsy plastic, the bits slide out of the holders, and the driver just feels as if it may not last for too many builds.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend this primarily for the bits alone, just be prepared to replace the driver at some point.
0571238343|5.0|I got the book with a good price..and the book exceeded my expectation ..in addition it comes with a cd too which is a plus for me.thanks...:)
B00640UICA|4.0|I loved this game! It's just about perfect. The only thing that could improve this game would be the addition of hints. I had to use some YouTube walkthroughs for some of the last levels.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Extraordinarily well acted, written and directed, this series is far better than most movies.  Along with &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; &#34;Homeland&#34; is one of the two best shows on television.
B00BN4JQ6G|5.0|KOL box set collection meet all fans' expectation. This is a great collection box set. You can not miss it from your KOL collection.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Ancillary Justice is a complex book to review.  Even though the book is written in the first person it takes awhile to learn the main character's name.  You do get hints of what she is or was.  That just adds to the tension and really hooked me into the story.<br /><br />I usually like to break a book into parts but I find it will not work here.  Things like plot, characters, and world building are all so intertwined they are impossible to separate..<br /><br />All unfold in the story as you need them.  Understanding Breq, the main character, depends on understanding the world she lives in.  The plot unfolds as you learn about Breq.  The world building is disclosed as you learn about the Breq and as you learn about the Breq you learn about the plot.<br /><br />Even the development of the other characters depended on how Breq is seen in the story.  Much of this was told using small details that added to the richness of the book.  Ann Leckie set out to build a complex world filled with interesting characters and she more than succeeded.  Her eye for detail paid big dividends in the development of the story and the characters.<br /><br />Part of the reason I kept reading was to learn more about what Breq was doing, who Breq was, why Breq was where she was, when the story was taking place and where Breq was going.  All of this came slowly into focus while a very good story in a new and complex world was being told.<br /><br />Recently life has been interfering with my reading but every chance I got I picked up Ancillary Justice so I could continue to read.  For me that is the mark of a really good book.<br /><br />I recommend Ancillary Justice for any Science Fiction fan.  Ancillary Justice is book one in a loose trilogy (That is how it was described in an interview with Leckie in the back of the book).  Breq is successful in a way she did not suspect and that opened up new adventures for Breq.  I am ready of book two and more of Breq and her world.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this one also just hope the movie coming out stays true to the book I would be a shame if it doesn't
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a refreshingly light fantasy with a lot of wonderful imagery, different and compelling, subtle and sweet.  I really enjoyed my time in The Night Circus.

B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I read this book on the Kindle Paperwhite - The story started out great, but throughout the book there are a lot of vintage photographs and some handwritten letters. The photos were very difficult to see on the paperwhite, and the words written on the bottom of the photographs and the handwritten letters were impossible to make out. Then, when I finally reached the end, I found out that this book is only half of the story. If I had known that this book didn't have an ending, I would not have continued to read it when I found out that I couldn't see the photos properly.<br /><br />Overall a very disappointing read on a kindle. Maybe it would have been better in a hard copy format.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|Not very challenging or fun. Maybe it is designed for children. No offense if your opinion on this differs. Paleolithic
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I  thoroughly enjoyed it and the ending was a complete surprise.  This was my first Lianne Moriarty book and I'm going to read some more.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|This is a complex set, but really a nice model when it is done.<br />It really looks like the old VW van.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I always loved the &#34;Self Portrait&#34; and &#34;New Morning&#34; albums...one of those surprising turns in Dylan's (surprise-filled) career. This new look behind the scenes of that phase is fascinating, and presents a nice fusion between folk tradition and the thoroughly modern Dylan. For people like me, there's never enough of this kind of thing--further evidence of is stature as pretty much the greatest writing musician ever.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|The action seems are great storyline is very touching. I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in a movie nite
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Can't tell you how happy I was to find out that Cher is still at her best, and then some.<br />The entire album is pure DIVA POWER and so great to listen to.<br />Dance, Power-ballads, country, gay-anthems, they're all there!<br />YOU'LL THANK ME AFTER BUYING IT! :)
B000AAF1U4|5.0|love this movie has great actors is very funny and my grand kids loved it<br />would recomind this movie to all my friends..
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I found this book to be the rare, for me, combination of a captivating story that did not distract me from the awareness of how exquisite Rachel Joyce's writing is. The poignancy of of these unlikely characters, Harold and Maureen, both on untenable journeys, one by choice and one not, is painted to perfection by Ms. Joyce in a her choices of words put simply together. This delicate journal was a page turner, almost from the get go.
B007REV4T8|1.0|You think OCTOPUSSY is the most boring JAMES BOND of all time? Think again! This was NO SPY MOVIE, it was a BUDDY MOVIE with BOND and M hitting the road with a script from an episode of THE A-TEAM. This movie is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT even with one of the best BOND's ever, DANIEL CRAIG. The writers of this drivel would be better qualified for late night commercials for GINZU KNIVES and BASS-O-MATIC BLENDERS.
B004OKFIRW|5.0|Love it and a must have album for all music lovers and collecters. Personally now have both CD & Vinyl formats. Highly recommended !!!
1476715904|2.0|I had high hopes for this book. Really high hopes. The only poems that's re good in this book are Will's. Lake really does act like a little brat and I don't really see what Will sees in her. She is very immature and I don't believe she is ready to take care of the additional responsibilities she demands from her mother. Romance??? The romance pretty much died after Lake sees Will at school. I really had high hopes, but this book failed.
B001EPIIMC|1.0|LP delivered not as claimed by the seller. Loads of scrathes and spend additional $$$ for cleaning and all. Unrecoverable... sadly not going to play this. Luckily I have a good quality CD format of same album. Returing the LP will cost me even more.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I can't wait for the next season to come out.  This series is the best.  It leaves you hanging for more after each episode.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I finished this book with a big fat \\"oooooooooh\\". I have never read anything from Liane Moriarty before, but it came up as a suggestion and I thought, what the heck. I couldn't put it down. I can easily see this being made into a movie, maybe a Lifetime Original. It's like a chick flick in book form.<br /><br />There are a ton of supportive characters so it was a little hard for me to remember who was who for about the first 200 pages, but I quickly became attached to all of them. I constantly had conflicting feelings of support for each of them. For me, this had a feel like Gone Girl, but the twists and turns were more \\"real life\\", \\"could happen\\".<br /><br />Read it, well worth the price. This is probably the first book I am considering reading more than once. For now though, I am going to see what other gems this author has.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It was fun.  I am only posting here on this site so that I may continue with the extra puzzles.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I PC game on a normal keyboard with the medium-grade keys which aren't quite as sensitive as a super low profile laptop keyboard, but requires less force than the standard box key boards.<br /><br />This controller uses the large tall box keys, which might work for someone who is used to mashing buttons with great force, but I find it causes too much tendon strain especially with the weaker fingers (pinky, ring).  After using this keypad for 20 minutes, my weaker fingers were trembling from the strain of trying to get the keys to respond.  I can game for 8 hours solid on my normal keyboard and not feel a thing.  Poor design, if you ask me.<br /><br />It keymaps easily, but you might have to re-program the same key-bind a few times before it accepts it properly.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is an awesome game for everyone.I love doing and figuring frighteningly puzzles, so this is right down my ally.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I zipped right through this book.  Entertaining with suspense.  Im reading Shift now, but am hoping the characters from<br />Wool eventually show up in this book. If not maybe in Dust.
0345472322|5.0|Loved this book so much I have given it to family and friends and suggested it for my book club.<br />I heard the author speak at an educational conference, and I was so impressed with the quality of her research that I ordered the book.  I admit I've spent most of my life so far with more of a fixed mind set regarding intelligence and talent.  The research summarized in this book certainly convinced me to take a &#34;growth-mindset&#34; instead.  Not only was the book revelatory to me personally, I sure wish I had known about this research when my children were young. I agree with the other comments about this book literally changing your life.  Can't imagine anyone who wouldn't benefit from reading Dweck's work!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|For anyone interested in mystery/suspense this is a must read. Book is well written through the eyes of the father defending his son who is a accused of murdering a classmate.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|For the time period that these were made they are outstanding. William Shatner is fantastic as Starfleet Captain James T. Kirk.Shatner shows different sides of Kirk and you will understand why the Trekkies wanted to know more about him. Leonard Nimoy portrays Science Officer Spock. A Vulcan that knows nothing about humans and understands nothing but pure logic.The words Illogical became synonymous with Spock,with his pointed ears and logic helped Kirk vanquish quite a few enemies. Join the crew of the USS Enterprise and explore new worlds and civilizations. You will soon see why these characters are so loved around the world.

B00DQC2FPM|5.0|First off, the car is awesome.  Second of all, it was super easy to put together.  Finally, it's so cool that it comes with pieces to make which ever car you want from all three movies.  Cool!!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|The case is just as it was described.  I've only had it for a few months, so I can't speak to long-time wear, but it seems to be holding up just fine.  I carry it with me all over the place in my bag every day, and haven't had any issues.  The clips hold my Kindle securely and the elastic band keeps it shut tight when not in use.  It is easy to set up as a stand as well, and stays exactly in place at the angle I prop it up in.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this case and would recommend it!

B002KDSBGA|5.0|Ahead of its time when released, but not outdated even today, unfortunately. And the acting measures up to our 21st century expectations. In other words, this is a timeless piece.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The Series is completely entertaining.  The character are likable from the good to even the bad.  Fast-paced drama with enough detail to enjoy watching over and over again.

0765318741|5.0|Richard Matheson's \\"I Am Legend\\" is one of those novels, which takes a very basic premise and runs with it.  In this case, the idea that one man is left alive in a world devoid of all things human.  The power of Matheson's novel is such that it has been filmed three times and has remained in print since its initial publication.  If you have only ever seen the movie adaptions of \\"I Am Legend,\\" than remove any preconceptions you have about the story, because the book is substantially better than the films.<br /><br />The story focuses on the trials and tribulations of Robert Neville, who survives a massive disease that manages to wipe out all of humanity.  However, every other man, woman and child on the planet has reanimated from the dead.  This forces Neville to spend his time scavenging for food and supplies during the day, and trying to survive in the ruins of civilization at night.  Alone in his home with small remnants from a past life, Neville is forced into a life of isolation and loneliness.<br /><br />Most of the story is told after Neville is the last human alive, however there are some interesting flashbacks that delve deeper into what occurred during the first breakout.  These flashbacks also help set up a connection between Neville, his wife and child, as well as with neighbors and friends.  The emotional implications of being the last human being are set in stone when these brief occurrences turn-up.<br /><br />The more interesting parts of the novel are the scenes in which Neville's own humanity is called into question.  Neville agonizes over the destruction of the vampires, and it begins to take a toll on him both mentally and physically.  He becomes paranoid and dangerous and a far more interesting character for it.  Through the progress of the story, humanities last hope increasingly becomes less human.<br /><br />It isn't until the end of the novel that the reader can sit back and appreciate what Matheson was setting up from the beginning.  This combined with one of the best concluding chapters I've ever read, makes this short 160 page novel one of those books you easily recommend to others.<br /><br />Furthermore, because Hollywood has adapted this book to film, more people \\"know\\" the book than have actually read it.  Just as Matheson's \\"The Shrinking Man\\" bears little resemblance to the film that was based upon it, so too does \\"I Am Legend\\" rise above the films (and the reputation) which came after it.<br /><br />Five stars.mbined with one of the best concluding chapters I've ever read, makes this short 160 page novel one of those books you easily recommend to others.<br /><br />Furthermore, because Hollywood has adapted this book to film, more people \\"know\\" the book than have actually read it.

1250010403|5.0|Loved the book and read all three available book. The book was in very good condition and told a great story. My frieds have all read the Chronicles and are on tender hooks waiting for the next one. (Maybe the final one?)
B00CATONCA|4.0|The detailing of the heads are amazing! DVD's are bit hard to get out of the tank. To turn on the lights you must press the 3 on the tank where it says season 3.

0896898288|1.0|If I had known that this book used only templates, or that you hand to print all 106 templates on the printer (one per page) I never would have bought this book.  Love the quilt, love the blocks, hate the the templates.  How wasteful!

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I first saw the ads for this movie and thought, wow, after seeing it in the theater, I knew I wanted to own it. Watching this movie was full of information right off, things I didnt know about surfing. I never have gone surfing before( as i'm not a very good swimmer) so never really wanted to, but none the less its very interesting and looks really cool. Seeing all the hard work that surfer's go through its amazing to watch the events that they take part in.<br />After seeing Bethany ( well the person who played her in the movie) get attacked by the shark and loose her arm was very sad. But for her to come back and contiune to surf and enter tournaments was/is very incureaging and inspirering. The movie also had bonus features, interviews with cast, special affects, and locations. It was a great movie to me, so glad I was able to purchase it. Thank you

1780387105|4.0|Decided to give this book a try after picking up the guitar for the first time in about twenty years.Previously, I had been able to play all kinds of chords and even some lead, but only if it was all written out for me. That got frustrating enough that I didn't pick up the guitar for a while,and when I did, I didn't know where to start. Then I found Justin's videos.He is very thorough, which was good for me because I had never had formal lessons and there were some basic things I wasn't getting. Of course, this is not for everyone, but I like the way it's set up. True, there is no slash notation, but I think that invites you to &#34;play&#34; with the music more. Want to try the suggested strumming pattern? Go for it! That too hard? Stick with the basic down strums. Want to try something else entirely? Cool! For a perfectionist like me,it's good to have some things open so you're not afraid to experiment. Hopefully,this book will get me &#34;Playing&#34; instead of just following along
0446547646|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks.  He is a good writer and I enjoy is books very much.  I've read just about everything he's written and have seen most of his movies also.

B00464AVXW|5.0|This is the original scary movie. It lacks the special effects of today but that is it  The story line is still sliver and scary
B005LAIIMG|2.0|I had no idea when I ordered this movie that is was just another UnDead regurgitation.<br />The TV is so loaded with these things, that it becomes frustrating trying to<br />find something else to watch, and I go and order a movie about the same junk.<br />While the movie is fast paced, Pitt (the only big name in the movie) moves at a<br />lethargic, unaware grind that made me think he was just thinking of his paycheck.<br />The CGI action is so fast paced, that it makes the whole thing feel like a rush to<br />finish up the shoot.<br />With all of this said, I did watch the whole movie, and it was entertaining, so it<br />is a few steps up from Inglourious Basterds.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is one of the most exciting new writers on the scene. Gone Girl is mesmerizing, stylish and such a tension-builder, I could not put it down. Be sure to check out her first two books as well. She is especially good at drawing flawed characters and dissecting what makes them so.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It worked with my phone wifi, but not my home wireless router, so i havent really used it yet. Hoping to get a new wireless router at home so it actually works. Idea is cool.
B00CXQL828|5.0|One of the best CDs I've ever heard from top to bottom. As a Dream Theater fan for 20+ years I was worried this CD would have the same undertone as DT and that wasn't what I was looking for. Imagine my surprise when it sounded nothing like DT. I was a drummer in the 80s and therefore prefer that era for rock music. The Winery Dogs have taken a step back in time and have written some of the most kick a** songs I've ever heard, as well as some beautiful ballads. Leave it to Mike Portnoy to come out smelling like roses one more time. With Mike Portnoy on drums, Billy Sheehan on bass and Richie Kotzen on guitar and vocals this band is an epic trio for sure.
B004L49K20|5.0|This album is remarkable for sounding unmistakably Duran Duran, reminiscent of Rio, and also fresh with some great musical hooks. This is no nostalgia album or rehash. The music has energy and drive while they explore new sounds and textures. The lyrics and themes of the tracks are excellent, touching on love/lust(of course), regret, social media,  and technology. The album is also mixed very well. The signal level is high overall, but it doesn't sound compressed. The dynamics and soundstage are very good, and Simon's voice is crystal clear. Below his voice the bass is strong but not overpowering. Surrounding him are dense textures that combine into a mesmerizing sonic panel. My favorite track is 'The Man Who Stole a Leopard.' It's haunting, sad, and achingly beautiful. The first time I heard it on my hi fi, it brought a few tears. I also highly recommend 'A Diamond in the Mind' concert blu ray which includes several of these songs.
B001BANK32|5.0|Somewhere in my memories, I created one that said &#34;The Shining? Of course I've read it!&#34; But I hadn't. And all these years later, I've just finished it and find myself stunned.<br />I was browsing the reviews for Dr Sleep (which is seconds from being downloaded) and there were a few comments I simply didn't recall from this story (boiler? Halloran alive?), seeing it on sale, I dove into it first.<br />This book is not Kubrick's movie. This book scared the hell out of me and my mom took me to see the Exorcist at 5 so I'm rather jaded. Halfway thru this book, I had to stop and watch the movie and I can't believe what I thought I knew about this book and what is really here.<br />King doesn't create characters, he breathes life into them down to their DNA. There's something deeply touching of his treatment of Jack, it's more than fiction...it feels personal. Everyone always uses that phrase &#34;This is classic King&#34; when reviewing SK's work, but this is every facet of SK. The horror, the hope, the tragedy, the fall asleep with the lights on terror.<br />Times have changed, our fear meters are more sophisticated. That doesn't hold true here. From the building tension, to the straight out scares of what might await you behind a door you shouldn't open or a sudden clattering of an elevator climbing to your floor that no one alive inhabits, this book will stay with you.<br />If you think The Shining ended with a crazy dead guy in a frozen maze, you didn't read it either.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have read all of the Philippa Gregory books. I always wait axiously for her next novel. This book all my exeptations.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Not quite as funny as I expected but I'm a little out of the target audience (47 years old). Still a fun and definitely worth the time.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Muddied seems to be a frequent and appropriate description for the sound of the original release of this album; it was clipped and distorted, making for unintelligible lyrics. Always loved many of the songs from the disk, though. What a joy this remix is then! It makes a huge difference with the vocals and lyrics being so much clearer, there's a lot of nuance and depth that was essentially just lost or drowned out in the original mix, the individual instruments and layers achieve new clarity, and there's even a guitar solo in \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" I never noticed before! Plus, I find I'm liking some of the other songs much more than I did before.<br /><br />Give the sound clips a listen for an idea of the improvements, and then imagine cranking the CD up on a good sound system. Oh, yeah.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of remixes in general, but this was indeed a trip worth taking - the album seems fresh and new, and I'm sure that repeated listening will reveal more things unnoticed before.
B008NMT684|1.0|After a dozen attempts, the app still will not load.  I have not been able to use it so I can not give it any more than one star.
B00FEHXISA|4.0|I wasn't expecting much, and had heard it was very violent.  I closed my eyes in a few parts, but the story was interesting, and I enjoyed the main actors a lot, so I give it four stars.  Robert Downey, Jr. is really so entertaining, he keeps what could be too heavy a bit lighter.
0060730552|5.0|A riveting, page-turner of incredulous human strength. These young Brits in 1985 decided to tackle the World's 3rd Deadliest Mountain and ascend the unclimbed West Face of Siula Grande. To this day - their feat is unchallenged or repeated.<br /><br />I won't spoil the book for you - but the reality of what Simpson and Yates encountered is simply stranger than fiction itself. If it were not for surviving this \\"unfortunate incident\\"... Simpson would never enjoy the Worldwide fame and fortune he relishes today, as a highly sought-after Corporate Motivational Speaker, Author and Lecturer.<br /><br />This book is among my Top 5 BEST Mountaineering reads:<br /><br />1) Into Thin Air, Jon Krakauer<br />2) Shining Mountain, Peter Boardman/Joe Tasker<br />3) Touching the Void, Joe Simpson<br />4) Ultimate High(My Everest Odyssey), Goran Kropp/David Lagercranz<br />5) Nanga Parbat Pilgrimage, Hermann Buhl
B00F35BV64|2.0|I really enjoyed the first prequel, but this second one left me a little sad.  Movies and television are wonderful forms of escapism.  One miracle of our humanity is our ability to suspend disbelief, which allows us to enter into and feel magical worlds, whether through told tales, books, television or movies.  Although not a die-hard Trekkie, I have followed the series all my life, through its many incarnations (OK, I deep-sixed Deep Space), but this latest movie seemed to make a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation.  I don't think that he would appreciate the caricatures that have been made of Kirk, Spock, & the crew.  Star Trek was never meant to be a comedy in space.  I think that the actors are good or at least competent and should be given the chance to do something a little heavier.
B000I8ERVC|4.0|After seeing this movie for the first time in my mid thirties I thought to myself that perhaps this is where the modern \\"road trip\\" movie began.  Endless shots of motorcycles profile, the sky, the panorama fill this film.  I did not mind in the least.  Worth it just to see Jack Nicholson play a completely different kind of character.  Dennis Hopper was great as well.
B008M0UTRO|5.0|Depending on your dedication to Studio Ghibli, you may be finding this movie only alright when it starts. Then you will see the Latin Quarter and meet Mizunuma, and you'll be sold.<br /><br />Although not as appealing as some of Studio Ghibli's other films, this is still an enjoyable and has already stood up to a few rewatchings.<br /><br />*Note on this particular version: video, audio, and subtitles all worked fine on my computer and PS3.
075669812X|5.0|My 5 year old (and my husband!) love this book! They read it every night before bed. I would recommend it to others.
0143124544|4.0|I was recommended this book from England where it is a best seller.  In places it was hard to read and it had a sad ending that was so foreseeable I was braced not to cry in public.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I did not watch Dr. Quinn when it was first out, but have since discovered it. I absolutely love it, so much so that I bought the whole series. I've never done that before. The stories are wholesome, realistic, exciting, and the characters are endearing and believable. Some you love and some you don't, but all are an integral part of the story. I would highly recommend Dr. Quinn for pure enjoyment!
B00004Z4SD|4.0|This was well done movie of an old man was determined to see his brother after no communication for 10 years.  It was worth watching especially since it really happened.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a good story. Sad but sounds like it could be based on true happenings. I liked the characters.
B000AOA2G8|1.0|The product is very poor quality. The wrench broke the second time my son used it. Would not buy again.
1452126577|5.0|I'm a huge Grumpy Cat fan, so you can imagine my delight when I found out she had a book coming out. This is a cute little read and it only took me a half hour to forty-five minutes to do so in between phone calls at work. I laughed a lot throughout, and I think I might just read it again sometime. Sequel, please! :D
0345803493|5.0|Had to buy the second bookbecause my &#34;grown&#34; daughter lost the first second book.  This a great series.  E.L. James is making the most of it. Highly recomended.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love the pink. The screen is a bit more difficult to press the numbers or letters you are punching but it is worth that disadvantage to make sure the phone is protected as no cell phone dealer will show any mercy on phones if they get destroyed accidently before the contract is up. Needed the protection for my phone, and the price was right!
0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown doesn't do second best.  This like his previous and current novels is easy to read, rivets your attention and doesn't let you down.  A must read.
B00DXP0QX0|2.0|I did not care for all the ad lib to the old songs on the first disc. I have always loved Rod Stewart, but this was awful in my opinion. In the future I will wait until the CD becomes available and not pre-order so I can hear the songs to see if I want to place the order. I was saddened that it was not what I thought it would be.
0439023491|5.0|Bought for a friend, read it myself too. Wonderful writing, and good read. I would highly recommend this awesome book!
0316204366|1.0|'David and Goliath' is a book about what happens when ordinary people confront 'giants' (powerful opponents of all kinds). The book makes two unique contributions: 1)Facing overwhelming odds can produce greatness and new ideas. 2)The same qualities that give giants their strength are often also sources of weakness (a twist on Judo's using an opponents own strength against him). As for the original David and Goliath story, Gladwell adds interesting detail and posits a credible medical explanation for Goliath's vulnerability - that he suffered from 'acromegaly' in which an enlarged pituitary gland overproduces HGH and also compresses nerves from the eyes --> poor eyesight.<br /><br />Gladwell then tells that a study of wars involving one side at least 10X the size of another found the smaller opponent won 28.5% of the time. Surprising! More importantly, if one looked at warfare in which the underdog used unconventional tactics, those 'underdogs' won 64% of the time! (Think of the U.S. in Vietnam, Afghanistan.) Lawrence of Arabia succeeded against more numerous and better trained Turks by surprising his opponents and attacking from an unexpected side. Useful lessons, per Gladwell - We think of things as helpful that actually sometimes aren't, and other things as unhelpful that leave us stronger and wiser.<br /><br />Gladwell then applies his thesis to the life of super-lawyer David Boies, a man from humble origins who now heads a firm of 200 lawyers - seemingly a Goliath himself. Boies secret advantage was being dyslexic, and attributes his success to that seeming impediment. (Others include Goldman Sachs' president - Gary Cohn, and Hollywood producer Brian Grazer.) However, Gladwell's 'real' backing for his claim is a 2009 survey that found much higher rates of dyslexia in entrepreneurs than corporate managers. But this self-reported survey included only 102 responders, Gary Cohn's position is that of manager - not entrepreneur, and dyslexics are also over-represented in prisons - seemingly contradicting Gladwell's thesis Gladwell then tries to worm his way out of this self-generated conundrum by citing an even smaller and non-generalizable study. And the thoughtful reader will also realize that David Boies is far more complex than simply someone with dyslexia - he also had very high SAT scores, per his autobiography. Taking Gladwell's point to the extreme, this means we needn't worry about poverty, prejudice, childhood traumas, etc. Readers are left with the sense that Gladwell really doesn't know what he's talking about - that he's just cherry-picking data and reports to suit his theories, a dangerous practice for any amateur in any field.<br /><br />Previously, in 'Outliers,' Gladwell contended that 10,000 hours of practice was the essential requirement for excellence - a ridiculous claim. Taken at face-value, I supposedly could be a professional football star (at age 70), as well as a Nobel prize-winner in most any area if I just split 20,000 hours of practice between the two fields.<br /><br />Then it's on to Caroline Sacks, high-school valedictorian who went to Brown University to obtain a science degree. Soon afterwards she barely flounders through organic chemistry, switched to another field, and concluded that if she'd gone to an easier school (University of Maryland) she'd still be in science. Okay, fifty years ago I might have successfully passed quantum physics at the local community college (definitely not at the University of Maryland) - is that supposed to mean that I had I done so I'd be string-theorist' today? Ridiculous.<br /><br />Any trained scientist will tell you it's unacceptable to simply concoct hypotheses and then amass anecdotes to illustrate and support them. But that's all Gladwell does.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Gladwell should have quit at the end of his David and Goliath story.in prisons - seemingly contradicting Gladwell's thesis Gladwell then tries to worm his way out of this self-generated conundrum by citing an even smaller and non-generalizable study.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Love this album so much I might even buy it for friends. Mackelmore is amazing and this album doesn't just have one hit, it has them all! Listen all the way through, very worth the download.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. Well paced, well written, and incredibly cool. King has not lost his touch to create frightening characters, nor has his abilities as a story teller dampened.<br />A superb read.
0345529057|5.0|I loved this series so much I bought a bunch for my family and friends. The show is good, but the books are even better. I highly recommend these books to anyone who is of the appropriate age (not appropriate for kids).
B001PPGAIK|5.0|I love the time that this move is about and love Hugh Jackman in it. He is just so different in all his movies.
0061438294|5.0|Love this book. It's very interesting, well written, well researched, and fun to read. I frequently find myself citing info I have learned from reading it and find it applicable in daily life. I would definitely recommend this book!
B002ZG981E|5.0|We bought this when it first came out and I really did not get into it till I watched it again with my son by that time I had given him the DVD so I bought myself on in Blu-ray. It is one of those movies that you have to watch a couple of time's to really understand just what is going on. Once you do understand you just have to have the movie but that is me I own alot of movies. I have my on personal Blockbuster LOL
B0015AARJI|5.0|Easy to use/install, I'd recommend to novice gamers. Tracks with precision and hasn't had any issues.  Well made controller, works great still!
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl is one of my favorite shows!! Zoey Deschanel is hilarious. The whole cast is great. Check it out!
0385347774|5.0|This is not a feel-good story, which is what I typically love, but the author is so adept at drawing the reader in and playing with his/her emotions that I couldn't help but love it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chrome cast was easy to set up as well as easy to use.  The streams are very clear and watching videos is very easy.  You can control YouTube and Netflix from your phone or stream  videos from your Internet browser which is awesome.  Support for HBOGo is coming as well as other apps.  For $35 it's a no brainer,  and will only get better over time.
B00E8TWPI4|5.0|My 8yo daughter loves this movie. It's like Grease for the pre-teen set. What I like is how nice it looks on her Kindle Fire HD and playing through our Blu-Ray player. Well worth the extra $2 for the HD version if you have the equipment.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Hi! I am very old yahoo user.<br />First it was ok. Later they joint with AT&T and some accounts became unreachable. At all. There was no way to gain back passwords to your own account. And customer support was no help. from both - at&T and yahoo.<br />So I created a new account. Now the story is - is the attachment is big - 8Mb or so yahoo would let you know about 1.5 days later that it was not able to deliver it, so it you already are on mission somewhere.... you are killed. 100%.<br />Don't use it for normal busy life! It is not reliable. It will hit you when you need all the support.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I cant stop adding my favorite things to my boards. Pinterest has everything you can imagine. I love the pictures and recipes!!!
B001AR0D4A|5.0|But it blows your mind at the end! It's very intense and kind of weird. But if you wrap your mind around the concepts its good!
B00CXQL828|5.0|Great songwriting and killer hooks from three of the best on their instruments.  My only &#34;desire&#34; is that this band can stay together for many years to come.  Great players, great songs...
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app vary clearly displays your battery situation.  If you need to know what it has left and where it is going, this is the thing to do just that.  It does it with out any need for consideration and interpretation.
B008M87GJK|3.0|The app seems to be biased towards US usage - perhaps with a little usage I can make it into a preferred World edition.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|the entire selection and purchase was easy and convenient. I buy almost all my movies at Amazon.com. The search option makes it so simple.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This needs more apps.  I don't use it that much.  Glad it was cheap.  It was easy to setup.  Can't wait for new apps.  Let's go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves the heck out this game his eye and hand skills are amazing because of this game Excellent
B00B22ASUM|4.0|A Street Cat Named Bob was a very sweet story about two homeless creatures, James Bowen and a ginger cat, finding each other and providing each other with unconditional love. More than that, it gave insight into James' backstory - how he lost his way, became a heroin addict, and found his way back. Without the \\"cuteness\\" of Street Cat Bob, he may never have made a living as a street performer or magazine seller - women were attracted to Bob and wanted to stroke his fur and hear his story and make contributions to his welfare. And James may never have received the help to totally get off addictive drugs and fight for a real life for himself. So yes, Bob did save James Bowen's life. He found transformation in his life and health thanks to Bob. He wrote, \\"It was as if someone had drawn back the curtains and shed some sunlight into my life.\\"<br /><br />Sure I like cats, but I found James' backstory much more important. I liked the insights given into why James became a heroin addict - pure and simple loneliness was his explanation. He was alone without family or support, and heroin was his friend, allowed him to anesthetize himself to his isolation. He felt invisible to all those walking past him on the streets of London, until there was a pretty ginger cat on his shoulder.<br /><br />As James sat playing his guitar on the street for money in Covent Garden, or then sold magazines outside the Islington Tube Station, James found that Bob stopped the rushing commuters, lightened their day, and also their pocketbooks. Bob has been a goldmine for James. And James has taken care of Bob in return. Nice, cute story. Now, how can we help all those homeless or helpless people in our society that we rush past, as there's nothing soothing and purring there to look at? This book made me more aware of strays - whether animal or human - and I found it more valuable in that way than as an entertaining read.<br /><br />Namaste!<br />Becca Chopra, author of Chakra Secrets
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've tried to log in numerous times and it says &quot; taking loner then it should , try again in a bit&quot; .. I restarted my entire kindle and repaired my app store and tried to make a new accounts and didn't  work AT ALL! This is bs! Someone needs to fix this ASAP! This is very unprofessional.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This music is for any time of day or night, but try it on a drive with your favorite other. This is romance with Bocelli at your side!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love this game! It's so fun. The thing is, I've played all the levels &amp; it's getting very boring. Please make an update adding more levels. :( I really don't Wang to delete it, after all I paid for it.
B00005RDRO|5.0|If you want to laugh before going to bed..try this movie. It always brings laughter. Neil Simon is a genius!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game. Especially because it's suitable for all ages. I'm 15 &amp; I can play it and my 4 year old sister can play it too. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the minions from Despicable Me 2 &amp; loves to laugh. :)
B00006RAKP|5.0|If you were to buy all the albums that housed these songs, you would be spending alot more money and taking up alot more space on your cd rack or iPod.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Absolutely love this series. Recommend for all to read.Love the characters,the plot,everything. It jeeps you hooked and before you know it your finishing one and starting the next
0525952926|5.0|I greatly enjoy historical novels and Ken Follett is the best.  You really get a sense of history while reading a novel.  I look forward to reading his third book in this Century Trilogy.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The story behind the game is amazing and i liked the fact that you don't have to pay for this game like you have to pay for alot of the other companies games
1451629184|5.0|A heartbreaking story that needed telling,
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|Not much to say. I bought the movie because I really liked it when I saw it in the theater. The definition is great
B004GUSG4M|4.0|it was a good book and filled with suspense.I recommend the book it was for our book club and everyone loved it.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not use to reading a &#34;short&#34; King book but I liked this one. It was a no-nonsense quick read but enjoyable. The ending was a little lack-lusterous.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Was so happy to received my copy and the Blu-ray is perfect! Will watch over and over again! A keeper!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I've never been a fan of comic books-to-movies, generally, but some work, like Batman.  I only watched this to get the back story for &#34;Agents of SHIELD&#34;, which I'm not certain I'll continue watching. Meh.
B00361R2VU|2.0|This was one of those films I've been meaning to see for a long time, but just haven't yet.  It was scary at moments but I didn't love it or find it to be very believable.  It wasn't engaging enough to watch in one sitting.  I won't be watching the sequels.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Though the story line is quite different than Matrix, you will see obvious reminders of the capabilities of some of the characters. Still, it is a pretty good movie for those who like the genre.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|A cute little movie that's good for the whole family.  I enjoyed this one.  If you liked this movie, I'd like to recommend a few others in case you're looking for something else to watch:<br /><br />Up<br />Rio<br />Aliens in the Attic<br />Ice Age<br />How to train your dragon<br />Open Season<br />TMNT<br />Alpha and Omega<br />Happily Never After<br />Robots... ha ha yeah.  You've got to watch Robots.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Just what I needed, good price and good quality.<br /><br />Forget about running out of battery, be sure of get it.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Iron Man movies are awesome.  Iron Man 1, 2, 3 and the Avengers.  All 4 were great and I'd recommend them heavily.  Good plot, lots of action and great on a home theater.  Crank up the sound and enjoy!  If you like Iron Man, try out Spawn, Thor, Hulk, Batman, The Green Lantern or any of the X men movies.  Transformers, Watchment, etc.  Can't go wrong with any of the comic-to-movie Blurays.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful interaction of characters and development of storyline in this period drama.  You will surely get hooked on this one.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I've watched this and I've watched The Avengers and both were great.  Thor is awesome.  You really can't go wring with any of these Marvel movies.  Any of the comic to big screen movies are great to watch.  Be sure to check out the Transformers, Elektra, X men, Hulk, Watchmen and Batman.  The only one I really didn't care for was Captain America...  But all these others are great!
B005NKGEP2|4.0|This is a pretty good mystery with an unusual format. What made the book enjoyable was the fact that it was set in various European cities. I was reading the book while in some of those cities.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I remember seeing the first Jurassic Park and how I loved it.  I wanted to check out the 2nd and 3rd in the series and it's a great to watch on BluRay with surround sound.  Jurassic Park 1 was awesome.  The 2nd was good, but not as good as the first.  The 3rd in the series was still pretty good, but not as good as the 1st or 2nd.  :)  5 stars for part one!  4 stars for part 2!  3 and a HALF stars for part 3...  well ok... I'll go ahead and give 4 stars for Jurassic park 3 since I think dinosuars are cool.<br /><br />If you like this movie, you may want to consider looking into King Kong (2005) and Godzilla (1998).
B00F2362IE|4.0|The costume was very cute. My son really loved it. The knee pads tore up pretty quickly. Also, the costume had a very strong chemical odor. We has to let it air out before my son could wear it. Overall I liked it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Iron Man movies were awesome, Hulk movies were awesome.  Thor is da man.  Captain America I admit I didn't care for that one, but when you throw them all together in this Avengers movie, you really can't go wrong.  If you like these comic-movie flicks, be sure and watch the Watchmen, Green Lantern, Batman, X men, Transformers, Elektra, Spawn, Incredibles or Daredevil.
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|What can I say. I love the story line, I love music of abba.  It is a must have in my blu -ray library.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|Pretty good.  I wondered at first if I was going to like it.  Really didn't think I would because it sounded kinda lame.  A blind guy turns superhero and kicks some butt... didn't sound all that great but it was pretty good.  Another movie about a Blind guy turning hero is Blind Fury.  The movie is worth 4 stars.  A few others you may like are: The Green Lantern, X men, Watchmen, Hulk, Spawn, Elektra or any other Marvels movie.
B0076I624W|5.0|I love this movie the frist time I Saw it at the movie theater...then when I purchased it on Vhs ..upgraded to Dvd and finally a deserved change to Blu ray.  The story line is great as well as the actors.  It's a must own for my blu ray library!!!
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I think they did a great job with this movie.  Very entertaining and worth watching if you like the Star Trek series.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Being a big fan of Action films.... I checked this one out and found for quick action fun this is a keeper.  it is a must have on blu ray.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Audrey Tautou was made for the role.  I recommend it to all.<br />Unless you don't like subtitles.  Personally I prefer this over dubbing
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game had some good puzzles in it. The difficulty progression is spot on. Had some puzzles I liked and sometime didn't like, but still fun over all.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is a fun  and somewhat addictive game.  Need to practice it more.  The hints are good and I do use them.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This app is fun, but, sometimes, it is very difficult. Some words are hard to guess unless you ask someone else (everyone sees things differently). That's what makes this app so interesting.<br />I'm going to rate this four stars, however, because you can only earn one coin per question. It takes quite a while to accumulate, so, often when you really need a hint you have to wait  until it's been so long since you've played that the app gives you free coins.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Best season of Dexter so far!!! I got the DVD in a timely manner.  Everything was great with this purchase.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Please ignore the ads. Just enjoythe satire of GaGa doing her best with pop anthems all over again. It will work better for you.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I love Dexter and have enjoyed all my purchases.  I will keep buying the DVDs in the future. I have two more seasons to go!
B00E13ZRFA|4.0|Ellie goulding has been a favorite of mine for awhile now. Her quirky voice lends this youth anthem the necessary energy to stand out amongst the dregs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Made me cry. And not a lot of books can do that to me. Definitely recommend this book. Sooooooo good
B00ECL7ZJ2|2.0|Prompted by Grantland's review (or sycophantic praise?) of this ostensibly \\"Indie\\" act, I thought I'd give it a spin.  Grantland is normally a trusted source and will forever be dear to me for publishing David Foster Wallace's (R.I.P.) brilliantly insightful (and obsessively footnoted, as was DFW's m-o) profile of Roger Federer.  But on this particular pitch from Grantland, all I can say is...WHIFF.  Seriously.<br /><br />Seriously? [giving it one more try]<br /><br />Seriously.  These tunes are light and boppy, sugar- (or saccharine)-coated boogie or even doo-wop -- a fusion of Wilson Phillips and the Bee Gees -- and could never be construed as \\"Indie\\" by any metric I've ever encountered.  A few tunes might even be mistaken for '70s-era Michael Jackson by the lesser-trained ear.  I suppose Haim could be a fun listen for those seeking a sound less than substantial, but I can't see this act having much staying power.  If anyone listens to Haim at all two or five years from now, it'll be while reclining in a dentist's chair with the local \\"LUV\\" or \\"LITE\\" hits station murmuring on a background Bose.  Then again, I thought the same thing about that other non-Indie \\"Indie\\" act Maroon 5, and people are still buying their \\"music\\" (if you could call it that).  I'd be surprised, though, if Haim garnered that much of a following.
B000ID37T0|5.0|one of al pacino best movie ever cant do any better then this movie. ok thanks for listens ok bye
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I have a ball playing uno. It helps pass the time when i got to wait on others or for a new task to do
B0020MKTOS|5.0|Clint Eastwood is great in the movie. and the story really good too. ok that it go out and buy it
B001N1DPDE|5.0|One of the best knives I have ever used. Very comfortable in the hand,and came extremely sharp for the blade profile. I have recommended this to several camping friends already. The sheath however needs some work. but worth it for a knife of this value
193700788X|5.0|i am slowly reading it because i don't want it to end I like to mix in light reading with my heavier stuff
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's by no means &#34;high quality literature,&#34; but it's a great read and impossible to out down. Easy read and good story.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like the new version of the app but had to remove the old version as Kindle did not automatically update to the newer version. And since installing, can't get the app to work properly when changing notifications. It keeps giving an error message \\"Twitter stopped working\\" and defaults to the original set notifications.<br /><br />Uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it helps. Hope it does, otherwise Kindle needs to further research the problem to resolve the issue since it looks like I cannot revert to the older version.<br /><br />Just logged back in and it is still giving the error message \\"Twitter has stopped\\" and won't update the notification changes. And now background pictures are not showing on profile.
B0006JGFNQ|5.0|Exactly as expected!!  Great toy would recommend to any gremlin enthusiast!  My child absolutely loves this toy great product!! Thank you
B0058A11AK|5.0|Barbra can do no wrong and with Alan and Marilyn in her corner she has another beautiful hit on her hands!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Top quality, could have mentioned that the dvd was region coded, luckily my tv in my room is region free, I probably should have known this anyway!! Great service, would gladly deal with you again. :)
B0029LHW68|5.0|Listened to LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS first and now im hooked! Night of the hunter! OH MY GOODNESS! FAVORITE SONG! THE BEGINNING IT SOOOOOO SEXY AND EPIC!!!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This was a great take on the original movie. I enjoyed the characters and gives one to rethink several parts of the first movie.
B00BUT5I84|5.0|If i wasn't a fan now the hell i am! This band, this music, is beyond epic. Reminds me of world war z. The music sounds, like as if you're in some sort of video game set or some epic background. Almost like a mythical battle. FLIPPIN BAD ASS!!
0486474917|5.0|The best detective ever,<br />it was written more than a century ago and continues to catch your interest all the time<br />I do recommend
B00594XOZU|1.0|I made my KiK and I enjoyed it . But now I am trying to log back on and it keeps saying this is taking longer than I thought . This app makes no sense at all and I hate it . Can you please fix this problem or better fix the app
0887431453|3.0|This book is ok but its not very educational like the BrainQuest pre-k work book. Its still a nice book however.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play this game.  It is not too difficult and can be stopped and started easily.<br />One of the best and easiest card games to play.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|ALL THE FUN OF A COMIC BOOK HERO BUT PUT INTO SCI-FI WITH REALITY. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR EVERYONE.
B009LA1QW6|1.0|When I ordered this, it said it will come in the beginning of November, it actually came a couple days after I ordered it.<br />I was excited when I was opening them up, but disappointed at the end.<br />The whole screen, front and back, was horribly cracked. I tried to open up the case to see the CD, and the corner of the CD that is suppose to be attached (sorry if that doesn't make sense, I don't know how to describe it.) fell of during the shipping, leading to the worse item I ever bought from Amazon!
0783231032|5.0|This item was a gift to someone but they told me they loved it! They were very happy with this item and I had no problems with it being shipped on time =] Thank you!!

1452126607|5.0|This calendar is sooooo CUTE! I LOVE Grumpy Cat and follow her on Facebook =] I can't wait to use it for 2014. This calendar is very colorful and has really good pictures every month! I highly recommend this seller =] Fast, prompt delivery. Thank you!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Excellent imaginative story.<br />I was familiar with one of his other books , and this was recommended to me.<br />The story drew me in from the second page and it was hard to put down!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0385523912|4.0|While disturbing in content (hard to believe people have to live with the deprivations that the North Koreans have faced in the last 30 years) it is very insightful and well documented.  The human interest stories show how people can be forced to believe anything.  I am recommending this book to everyone I know who reads important literature.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Fun to read and tough to put down.  For runners this book is a must.  It will motivate you to run and look at your own personal way of how you approach running.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun for all ages. Whole family plays. Wish there were more ways to earn coins but still lots of fun.
B00D7NWTSI|3.0|Was fun in 2D. Even better in 3D. Enjoyed the film very much. Worth getting if you are a Marvel fan. I will have to admit though, VERY disappointed that the best of the extra features, the JARVIS Second Screen, is only viewable to a select group of people. I bought the disc expecting to be able to use all the special features that I had heard about. The JARVIS Second Screen is ONLY viewable by those with Iphones/Ipads. There is no other way to access it or even to watch the clips included. Rather an insult. For this, I downgraded my rating. The movie is great. The extra features get a fat 0 because I was prevented from using all of them that I paid for.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Perfect audio in every way.  Looked and felt brand new.  I*'d love playing it on a major sound system and get the full benefit.
030014332X|5.0|This book was exciting and easy to read and that's saying something for history book. Well done.<br /><br />You will enjoy it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes you lose all track of time. Great graphics and content is updated often enough to keep things fresh and exciting.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|This was ok, but I found myself tuning it out or getting frustrated with the whining of the characters.  Maybe its the whole high school mentality.  I didn't like my high school years.  I hate to think I acted like that.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Okay, so far I've only watched The Motion Picture and The Search For Spock and I can say both are of excellent quality and I was surprised at the amount of extra stuff that are on each disc (I thought all the extras would be reserved for the..well, extras disc).<br /><br />Speaking of extras, I watched an ILM documentary on the ST III disc and that was a lot of fun.<br /><br />There's plenty here to geek out with for weeks to come.  I'm watching the movies out of order and I'm saving the best for last (...you know which one that is....).  And when I'm done I can watch them all again with the commentary on :)<br /><br />Long story short, if your a Trek fan you owe it to yourself to pick this set up!
B002ZG98J6|4.0|I still enjoyed it, sometimes it is good to watch something without the plot being so heavy. I did like it.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Probably by now everyone knows this book. It's a great book for all ages and the ending is just the perfect touch.
0316201545|5.0|This book lived up to the original! It picked up on the story in a fantastic fashion! Creative and fun on every page. I can't put this book down! A must read for anyone that read The Land of Stories! Thank you Chris Colfer for writing another masterpiece! I'm hoping for a Land if Stories 3!!
B006X50OPW|5.0|This book is great for everyone who even has a little bit of interest in markets. Even if you don't want to be a full time trader but just find the markets interesting you will find this book really insightful.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|Recommended by a friend, I'm glad I read it. It was better than I expected. The details were interesting;well written
B00003CXSM|5.0|This is the average Chick flick but Jennifer Lopez does a great job of doing what she does best. With a very good looking cast this movie is very entertaining to watch.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Item came in good time and is boxed well and plays great. The show is good but does get a little lame at the end. I would reccomend to Sci-Fi lovers or any one who enjoys good movies.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging! I'm a little bit obsessed and so is my 5 year old son! Definitely worth playing!
B005CRY2O6|5.0|Great combination of flavors!  I bought this book on the recommendation of Russ Parsons, and I'm not at all sorry.  It's a gorgeous book, fun to read, and brings together lots of our summer produce.
1250029465|5.0|The book showed how important an animal can be to a person who needs to see love and devotion in his life.  I was touched deeply by the story  and how James respected the cat and wanted to do better in life so he could be a good companion to Bob.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a fun game if you like crashing and burning on a regular bases. Fortunately I don't  mind. You need lots of room to play this game
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I enjoyed playing this new version. I liked how the birds had new powers. the first few lwvwls have been pretty easy.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|This is my first time with this developer of this game. I really like that it has instructions on how to play the levels and you can zoom in by touching the screen. I will definitely look at some of there other games
B008220D5K|5.0|Funny...great flick to watch for both the guys and gals. So many great scenes that relate to the real world in a comical way
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|They just keep putting out good CDs! I feel like they really put some emotion into the songs on golden.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Loved the movie the firt time I saw it, then a couple years later started looking for it to add to my collection. Great find, awesome movie, thanks
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|Without using the hints I have no idea how to move on. Not for me to use. I do not like to play a game and keep checking on the answers.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|My wife and I loved watching this far fetched, goofy, wonderfully put together movie.  The characters are wonderfully portrayed.  Whether you like a good shoot em up with a spy oriented story, or just seeing some great actors/actress working together, you will like this.  Get the popcorn.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I like how this book explains step by step what I need to do in order for my book/s to be professional in appearance on Kindle.  Now I know what formatting is best and what will work or not work.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|So glad I purchased this 5 ft USB to Micro-USB cable for my kindle fire HD.  It has really come in handy!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|it is well written and easy read.<br />Makes  me want to go to all those places in Washington, especially the library of Congress.
B00133KFGW|5.0|We loved the story of music , sound and destiny !<br />The child in the story would not give up on his desire , he BELIEVED his parents would return for him<br />If he played his music.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I ALMOST FELL ASLEEP AND CHOKED TO DEATH WATCHING THIS POS MOVIE.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE WRITERS SPENT ABOUT 5 MIN PUTTING THIS ONE TOGETHER.  THE CAST ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS ONE IN.  THEIR PREFORMANCE INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE RATHER DONE SO.  ALL IN ALL, VERY BOREING AND UNSATISFYING MOVIE.
B006AKI5S8|5.0|I saw this movie back when it originally was released in the US -  and seeing it now, its even better.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Well, it's taken longer than that for me, but that was my goal. I have been watching the series on HBO and decided to read the series of books to see how well the series was following it. The book is full of other characters and more complicated stories, but the series is following the books with just the right detail. I love the books and would recommend them to anyone who likes this kind of genre.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|When I use to watch this as a kid it was more light hearted mystery so I thought it would be appropriate for my 5 year old to watch, but it is kind of dark for I would say a child under 8. There was characters drinking and heavy gun use. Otherwise this was a very good movie.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I love ,Love, LOVE Train! Their music makes me so happy! It makes me want to sing and dance. Fortunately when I'm driving I don't do the dancing part for consideration of others on the road!
B009LDD54K|5.0|The Best.  Could not be better.  I would recommend this series to adults only because of language and nudity.  Loved it.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Once you start this book it's hard to put down.  It was passionate, mysterious and very entertaining.  I have not seen the movie yet but I will.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I totally LOVE this app!!! I don't care what other people say, all I know is that this is the best free app, ever!!!  I totally agree with whoever voted five stars. Now, all I'm saying is right now, stop whatever your doing, go online to the appstore, and download Dragon Story!!! :)
0330351699|3.0|My 10th grader has this as a setbook for Pre-Ap English class.  It seems to have the required elements for learning about relationship between reality and idealism, and how people experience the clash of the two.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was my first erotic book i have read, couldnt put it down, it wasnt just the sex , the story was great !!
0788859544|4.0|I enjoyed this movie as a kid and I wanted to offer my children the same experience.  I received the DVD within several days. My kids love the movie, great buy at a reasonable price.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I can honestly say that I loved this book, it's 2:35 in the morning and I'm up typing this which should say something. This book, kept me turning the pages, and I'll admit it made me feel depressed the entire time I was reading it, but to me that's okay. I don't mind. This book was fantastically written in a language and a way that people in General can understand. Yes it did deal with a sensitive topic, and yes this made me depressed (but like I said I don't mind), and yes this book might make some of you out there squirm, but that makes it beautiful. The fact that it seems so real, the fact that these things are happening and people really are committing suicide and no one is trying to help them because they don't know what's going on, the fact that he took a difficult topic, and made you read about it, and made you understand, and made you think deeply about the choices your making and how you're affecting the people around you is something beautiful that needed to be done. I want to take this opportunity to thank Jay Asher for writing this book, not just for my benefit, but for every person everywhere who will ever pick up his book and read it. Thank you for giving me something that I will remember for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Sara
B00009V7PJ|5.0|But i spect the other version, the disc is cool, but the box it's not what a want, after all I love it, because is from Cher.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I can't wait to play more levels. This game is quite challenging. I like it. The different level settings are wonderful.
0739441671|4.0|I just really like Dan Brown and have been looking for more of his writings. The book is in as good of condition as they described and delivery was on time.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is a superb product. The Fire fits snugly and doesn't pop out. The case is the perfect size and fits comfortably in my hand. The material is high quality and the color is rich.
0307950689|4.0|I just really like Dan Brown and have been looking for more of his writings. The book is in as good of condition as they described and delivery was on time.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is an interesting idea. I want to see where the characters go. Plots similar to Percy Jackson ( the uninformed character) links to Star Wars ( who's your Daddy). I guess there are only so many concepts in Sci=fi. Interesting to see how they develope.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Really didn't like the game, but that's just me. Might be fun for others.give it a try then you decide.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I usually enjoy J Corey stories but this one seemed to go on for a LONG time with the oceanand navigation sections.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I appreciate this app for documents that I have to fill out and email to the all sorts  of  documents !!!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|The 2nd book in this series had never ending battle scenes and too many crazy creatures. I find character developement more interesting than the fantasy aspect.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|Very compelling series.  Every episode leaves you wondering what is next.  The series reflects what has happened in real life
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very well written. I felt as if I was hiking along with her. Can't wait for the movie to come out next year!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I missed the first 2 years but am now caught up to the present.  I look forward to season 6
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it 5 times during the 48 hour rental. The story line is touching, the music is beautiful, and the casting is well done.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|I am now up to date with Castle as I now have seasons 1-5.  I missed the first 2 years on TV
B001F6TXME|5.0|This replaced an off brand remote that never functioned properly.  I should have purchased the Nikon remote to begin with...
1452115567|5.0|it was a gift for a friend, who absolutely loved it! i highly recommend it as a fun, heartwarming book.
B000001EHS|4.0|Really enjoyed revisiting my younger years.  High energy music - &#34;has a good beat.&#34;  If I listen in the car, I tend to drive too fast though.
1609611543|5.0|What an eye opener.  Who knew!  I have definitely changed my diet.  It's sad that more people aren't telling the public about the hybridized wheat that is in our modern diet.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I have never given a review, but felt an obligation after reading Pines.  I read approximately 200 books (various genres) a year and have to say that this book was by far one of the best reads ever.  Looking forward to reading additional novels by Blake Crouch.  Kudos to Mr. Crouch for creating this incredibly suspenseful, thrilling, imaginative book!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Works very well and more protective than standard Marware case.  I do wish it had just a bit more stand angle for when sitting with it on your lap.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Nice graphics and different story plot. I would add this to my Collection of Super Hero DvDs. I recommend it.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great book. My son loved  the entire series. He's not an avid reader but he loved this a lot. Thanks
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|Not only is this film great b/c it is a biographical account of the great Charlie Chaplin, but it is well executed. First of all, Robert Downey, Jr. is amazing in the role - you almost can't tell the difference b/w HIM and the real Chaplin (similar to the Faye Dunaway/Joan Crawford resemblance). Aspects of his life are told/shown in a very creative way that is in line with how films were made/directed during his time - for example, the scenes where he and his associates attempt to hide in a hotel to finish cutting The Kid, and you see them running around, back and forth, at a higher speed reminiscent of how films from that area appear now. So, whether you're a Chaplin fan and/or a Downey, Jr. fan, this is a great film. Also, the soundtrack is phenomenal.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Great book. My son loved  the entire series. He's not an avid reader but he loved this a lot. Thanks
B000AAF1U4|5.0|My first one &#34;disappeared&#34;, and this was a replacement.<br />Love the movie, as it works for adults and not just kids.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini brings it home again.  Like The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, he poetically weaves together the stories of richly drawn characters, cracking open a world from another time and place.  His sensitivity to the inner landscapes of his characters juxtaposed with the harsh realities of their experiences, cannot help you experience this story with your soul as well as your mind.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David at his best, a thriller, fast paced, exciting and I enjoy downloading and reading books on my Thrive tablet
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Delightful, well-written and just enough humor and insight to keep you constantly entertained. I was saddened when it was finished. Well done, Miss Moriarty.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This was a gift for my son who loves the series and he has all of the sets.  Good buy.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|That whim of wanting to watch a childhood favorite, quenched by streaming, can't wait to find the next one on my target!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This third book in George Martin's series is full of unexpected twists and turns. The doomed sometimes escape, while both the guilty & the innocent die. Not for the faint hearted because of graphic violence, the book nonetheless holds the reader with complex characters, surprising plot twists and lush descriptions.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I've been a fan since the 90s I  see them every time they come to N.Y. but let me tell you I'm at the point now as far as albums go you got one you pretty much have them all it's predictable now and sad to say nothing new. just picked up Avenge Sevenfolds new album hail to the king and have to say they changed it up a bit. I was expecting same old here but not so. Change is good keeps you relevant and not stale. Too much talent here to keep playing same stuff. it's a great album but Dream Theater fans have heard it already
B00EFLLVKI|5.0|I've always been a fan of Italian literature. But, I don't really know what it is that makes me like books by Italian authors so much. Perhaps it's the way they write; like good old storytellers. Perhaps it's the subjects they occupy themselves with; like love and remembrance. Or perhaps they seem familiar to me because I also come from a country that's washed by the Mediterranean Sea. Whatever the reason, Italian books make me feel good, and the one at hand does that better than most.<br /><br />One More Day is the story of two seemingly different people that cross paths time and again. At the beginning that happens by pure luck, but as time goes by they start trying to steal glimpses of each other at any given chance. He's Giacomo and she's Michela, and their story is a story of love and loss, of failure and new beginnings.<br /><br />As we follow the heroes from Italy to New York, and finally to Paris, we get to know them very well; and we get to like them. They are very human, full of weaknesses and fear, full of hopes and dreams. I guess one could say that the whole story revolves around dreams. The dream of getting away from everything and everyone that keeps you trapped in a cage; the dream of starting anew in a different land; the impossible dream of learning to love all over again by playing a game.<br /><br />That's what Giacomo and Michela do, they play the game of love, time and again, but not for very long. Win or lose, at first that doesn't seem to matter to them. What matters is to get to know each other well, and to get to enjoy what each of them has to offer. They meet, they talk, they drink, they listen to great music and they make love, and the words flow like a serene stream on the page: \\"I wanted to become a hunter of emotions and memories,\\" he says. \\"We have been kicked outside of ourselves,\\" she states. \\"She was the door I had the courage to open,\\" he thinks and smiles.<br /><br />I could keep writing quotes for a long time, but I won't do it, since some of the magic of this book can be found in them, and I wouldn't like to take that pleasure away from you.<br /><br />I will tell you though, that if you are someone who enjoyed movies like Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight (yes, that great Paris trilogy), you will love this book. The prose is exquisite, the plot is simple and yet intriguing, and the feelings are as real as one could ever find in the pages of a novel. The author seems to inhabit the bodies and the souls of his characters and thus manages to give us a story that's hard to forget. This novel is a must-read for me.<br /><br />It has taken me a long time to finish this novel, but that was only because I was so enthralled by its heroes and their world that I wished it could go on and on. Of course, there are other books, as there are other stories; stories that remind us about the most important things in life; like how much it matters to be our own selves and chase our own impossible dreams. Just like Giacomo and Michela did.since some of the magic of this book can be found in them, and I wouldn't like to take that pleasure away from you.<br /><br />I will tell you though, that if you are someone who enjoyed movies like Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight (yes, that great Paris trilogy), you will love this book.

B00395ZYVS|4.0|Is anyone making a movie on this book ? Because this story should make it to a movie screen for a wider audience.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|So the mic really is awesome most of the time. It works like it says. Great audio quality.<br /><br />But about 25% of the time it RANDOMLY causes this horrible background noise like someone is blowing on the mic - which ruins the ENTIRE BLOODY VIDEO and cannot be edited out.<br /><br />Makes me want to buy a $700 sennheiser so I don't have to deal with this BS anymore.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Addicting and well made! I got 500 coins free with my Kindle Fire HD so technically, this game was free and even gave me 20 coins. The HD screen makes this even more beautiful. Music and sounds are spooky but quality. This game is short, but worth playing. Like others said, make it last by not using hints or walkthroughs. I want more! I love puzzle games but some are too easy and some are impossible but this is a good happy medium. And my favorite thing is that you can put it down and pick it up and be right where you left off. I am a mom and timed games are not the best because kids do not wait for checkpoints. Go at your own pace and enjoy the ride. Personally, I am super easily scared, so playing at night creeped me out, but it isn't so bad when muted. All in all, there is a reason it has thousands of reviews and 5 stars.<br /><br />Update: Beat 2 and 3, too.
1780387105|5.0|Easy to learn,<br />perfectly explained,<br />nice songs to learn.<br />A must have book, to start learn the guitar and to learn songs.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My son says: \\"This is a good app, it helps me do my homework, and to me it's the best thing ever. I hope you like it and it's a really good app to try out.\\"
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I really have enjoyed my Google Chromecase.  I can wait until I am able to stream more movies selections from other providers.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|I love the Coldplay live blue ray. Last year I went to their concert and this feels just as real watching it as it did in person.
1476727651|3.0|I think a big theme for this book is \\"potential difficulties that were never brought to bear\\".<br /><br />To summarize without spoilers; There was not at any point in the book, a moment where I felt the least big gripped by the events going on.  Every possible adversity was largely ignored by the author.<br /><br />Now on to spoilers.<br /><br />The book starts off with a few flashbacks and the like to Danny's life immediately after the events at the Overlook.  To summarize, it's rough, but he does okay.  Hallorann teaches him how to seal up the ghosts that've followed him...and my isn't that convenient.  That's one set of troubles that could've plagued him all through his life gone in two pages.<br /><br />So in the \\"present\\", Danny's at rock bottom.  It's typical King fare here; alcoholism, sex out of wedlock, things being depressing.  At this point I pretty much envisioned Danny having an uphill stru-<br /><br />NOPE, flash ahead and he's at AA and getting a regular job.  Sure he has to struggle early on...and right there, there's a problem.  The biggest crisis in the book seems to be Dan's struggle to avoid alcohol.  Could've been something.  Could've even been a point midway through the book where he falls off the wagon, but nope.  He'll be stayin' sober.<br /><br />The villains, a group of psychic vampires known as \\"The True Knot\\" are introduced here...by way of a rather explicit lesbian sex scene.  Uhh...okay.  Admittedly these characters are rather sinister; seemingly immortal, immensely wealthy, have all the power they could ever need..<br /><br />And if I may say; the two biggest failings in the book involve these guys.  First, they're too well described.  A big part of what makes King's \\"bad guys\\" scary is that they're built up to some big reveal.  This group is fully introduced and described at the start.<br /><br />Oh, and they're running low on their immortality juice (known as steam) and because of a kid they just killed, they now all have Measles, which is very much fatal to them.  So you've got the bad guys dying of Measles and running low on immortality juice.  Meanwhile Dan's doing pretty well for himself.  Remind us where the struggle here is?<br /><br />Anyway, things shift a bit when the True Knot discover the existence of an incredibly powerful psychic girl (ie; she has \\"the shining\\") and decide that killing her and inhaling her \\"steam\\" will not only sustain them for years, but also cure them of the Measles.  Again; not very threatening.  They come off as desperate more than anything.<br /><br />Heck, the True Knot's leader even engages in a bit of long distance psychic warfare with the girl at one point.  How does that fight go?  The twelve year old girl manifests a Game of Thrones character (I kid you not) and very nearly kills the True Knot's leader.  Remind me again who's supposed to be scary here?<br /><br />Of course, Dan eventually gets in touch with her and they meet (spoilers; Abra...I am your uncle!)  So now we've got...the two most powerful psychics on the planet against a dying race of panicked ill people.  Again; no tension there.<br /><br />Actually to be fair, there is ONE bit of tension.  Dan and several other adults (who VERY easily accept everything) ambush and kill the True Knot's kidnapper party, only to discover that one of them picked up on the possibility of an ambush, snuck out, and grabbed the girl.<br /><br />At this point, we start to get some tension because now, not only to Dan and the others have to save Abra when they have no idea where she i- Wait, psychic.  They find her right away and set out.  In the process, Dan also does mind hijinks with Abra and they kill her kidnapper.<br /><br />So...at this point the good guys decide \\"screw it.  We're going to kill the bad guys.\\"<br /><br />And this was another failing point; the True Knot supposedly have all this wealth and power, and at no time did they make use of it.  They could have bought up information on Dan's past to paint him as a kidnapper or worse where Abra was concerned, they could've used her doctor's (one of Dan's allies) alcoholism and used money as leverage to have him fired...any number of things, really.  They claim to have all of this power and influence and yet NONE of it is ever used.<br /><br />So how does the final fight go down?  Is there a bitter struggle as cornered-animal vampires use their supernatural powers or perhaps a purchased arsenal of guns against our heroes?<br /><br />Nope.  Dan conjures the soul of Abra's great grandmother (who dies in the book of cancer) and literally spews red ghost cancer at the entirety of the True Knot's army, killing them instantly.<br /><br />And then he and Abra team up psychically and push Rose off an observation platform where she breaks her neck and dies.  Oh, and did I mention that Dan actually releases several of the Overlook's ghosts from \\"The Shining\\" to fight FOR him?<br /><br />I'll admit; I was hyped, and I actually read this book in under five days.<br /><br />At the same time though, it's just not scary.  The good guys have practically no trouble doing anything, and honestly, the book actually makes me feel bad for the villains.<br /><br />And they're the ones who kill kids and inhale their souls.  Think about that.
0486282112|5.0|I honestly thought that I wouldn't like this book when I first had to read it for a school assignment, I'm happy I was so very wrong. This book is artfully written; it describes the emotions the characters feel, their appearance, and the scenery in a way that is very articulated.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|A lovely story - a true &#34;musical&#34; where the songs are an integral part of the storyline.  Also saw the Broadway adaptation -also great.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Strong plot line with an evolving story that keeps you interested...also characters not fully developed in the last book are further developed which allows you to follow these characters in more detail through the story.  Well written and Sanderson keeps you involved without divulging the conclusion.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|An excellent followup to Shout It Out!  Get the Girl Back is excellent and I especially loved Juliet!  A must buy!
B008JD7VZM|5.0|Bought this for my grandson....he loved it and had it put together in very little time....a little expensive I thought for such a small box....when it arrived I thought you sent me the smaller one....but they do say &#34;better things come in small packages.&#34;  He enjoyed it and that is what counts.....
B0091LS07E|2.0|Only one song that we liked and its not the version I wanted. Guess the radio cuts it to exclude the full song. Won't purchase another album from Ms. Keys. Will stick to singles. Very sad.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|If there were 6 stars that would be my rating. This cd is one of the best albums I've ever heard. She is talented, she is versatile, she can write, and she can definitely sing. The variety of songs makes it a perfect album for long drives. You can listen to it at home, in your car, in the club, while you walk, while you study, in work... It is good for any situation. Demetria Lovato is one of a kind. Amazing? No. Demi.
B000002KCF|5.0|I am a huge Michael Franks fan.  I am in the process of purchasing CD's of some of the hundreds of albums I own, and Michael Franks Art of Tea was one of my must!
B006HGXGWU|5.0|Fantastic movie with great acting and an ending that you would never expect. Definitely a must buy for any Michael Shannon fans!
B00005JKG9|3.0|Glengarry Glen Ross was a stage production that should not have been made into a movie.  That's my 2 cents
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Love Van Morrison.  It seems to have been so long since we've heard anything new.  I absolutely love the new release!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is awesome. It has great graphics,intense combat,a fun way to web sling,and a great storyline. I recommend it for any spider man fans
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|EXCELLENT READING!<br />Very true to life and the reseach that has gone inti this story is excellent.  Makes a person think. Would recomend to all parents  of teenagers.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Hidden objects scenes are well done, although I've played quite a few with clearer details. No need to spend any money as long as you only play for a few minutes at a time!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I have been playing this game for a year now. It has a few glitches here and there, the developers are constantly working to fix and improve this game.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|Great musicality,  reminds me of old school Metallica.  Worth the purchase for any rock or metal fan out there :)
B0093BUWGE|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Definitely worth the purchase. A truly awesome singer with a smooth delivery.  Looking forward to listening to more of his work.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There are authors I read cause they write and publish.  Mr. King is one, he tells a good story, with characters you invest in.
B0037AGASG|5.0|I received my cd in the mail pretty quick and I love every song on this album it's simply wonderful!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|it makes your knives sharp have used on several knives even a monkey could do it and its small enough to fit in your pocket
1582701709|4.0|The secret is a great book it is really positive and I love anything that has a positive message. Thank you.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I could not wait to seen the next season, only wish it was included in the prime earlier, that is the only draw back.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|A good rendition of the book with slight changes to give the audience a new experience. Can't wait for Catching Fire
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was the best<br />Who ever hasn't read it yet you are missing out.<br />A classic u cant get much better
0143121421|5.0|Graham Greene called this &#34;the best spy story I have ever read&#34;, and I would say Amen! The clinical dissection of a British Cold War operation reveals total moral ambiguity and that the rightness of actions can be judged, if at all, only in terms of the values of the societies the actions defend. For me, le Carre rises, on occasion, to the level of Faulkner.
B001NLL93W|3.0|Fun reading , I like this series it has all the demons werewolfs and humans put together and Clare has it all.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Imagine, using actors with singing voices, recording while actually acting, instead of in a studio...Novel & terrific!!!  This movie is a steal for any price.  There's a reason it did so well at the Academy Awards.
630542845X|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Great story and ending.  It kept my interest throughout the entire movie.
B0040IAZVM|5.0|If you don't know of her, Clara Haskil was a quiet &#34;legend&#34; - she died in 1960 but nearly all of her life (and career) was plagued by misfortune and illness. Severe stage fright stifled what could have been an amazing career, but thanks to recordings like this generous box set, she is alive and well! Her affinity was for Mozart but this collection contains many more treasures. A surprisingly &#34;modern&#34; Schumann Piano Concerto... reminds me a lot of Martha Argerich. Her Mozart concertos and sonatas are crystalline! An accomplished violinist, Clara had phrasing and colours not heard before. Her Mozart sometimes has daring tempi but is always pure. For me, though known for her Mozart, the entire Beethoven Violin Sonatas are here (with Arthur Grumiaux) and what a treat!
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is very addicting. I say down and played the whole game....had to do a few over a few times. But hey it kept me busy when I was home alone.I would recommend this game to kids who are bored
B0019N8P2W|5.0|My sister love the gift. Wonderful price for the series.  Would purchase again, and again. Excellent gift for anyone who loves Daria
B00005LK94|5.0|This DVD was used, and I expected it to probably have at least a few scratches. However, it was in mint condition! Not a scratch, and it played perfectly. It also arrived 2 days ahead of schedule, which was perfect because I was worried about when it was going to come. I give this 5 stars and an A+!
B005QYKD4I|2.0|Quality of the picture is great dont like the story too much.  the stero is  very good  will watch similar if nothing ekse available
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This alarm app is relatively easy to navigate and use, but it just drains the battery.  I took a quick look and can't see how to turn it off when I know I won't need it.  May have to remove the app??
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game was okay, nothing spectacular. Too easy in that every area of interest was pointed out. Also, the names of some of the HOs were perplexing to say the least! One could do worse when choosing a game  to play, but one can definitely do better than choosing this  one.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to return!  Kevin Spacey is perfect for the part and the supporting cast is excellent.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It is a great game!<br />It is amazing.<br />It is awesomely awesome.<br />It is fantastic.<br />It is a wonderful game and it is also really really fun.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Entertaining, love the different games, keeps my daughter involved.  She usually finds games and quickly figures them out and loses interest.  She really seems to enjoy this game.
8179927067|1.0|I bought this as a gift. The cd was an mp3 hence unplayable and the book was published with a foreign audience/reader in mind. The book is great but I would not purchase it in this package again.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matt did a great job in this movie. Great story line and wouldn't mind seeing it again. You should watch it.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Our granddaughter love all the monster high dolls and accessories and we look forward to additional playsets to come available - hopefully by the coming holidays. She now has all the available playsets
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Kept you guessing. Recommended viewing. Surprising outcome. The closer you look and think you know, you find you aren't close at all.
B00C6Q3UNK|5.0|my granddaughter &#34;loves&#34; all the monster high dolls and was very excited to receive the playset to continue her play adventures wit her many many monster high dolls.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This was the best Planet of The Apes I've seen. The other definitely had their merits but this one was very thought provoking.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|Just as the title above provides, it brought the kid in me out. I actually told my wife that if Pepper died I was gonna cry. Lol!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|A beautiful movie for children & adults alike ! Tape was excellent quality, color beautiful, sound perfect! I highly recommend it to all. I so enjoyed watching it with my granddaughter & seeing her delight!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Familiar characters are back with interesting story lines.  Tied up some loose ends that bothered me from previous books.  Can't wait for next book!
B004GYY714|1.0|IT wasn't at all what I was looking for.  I am seeking a program that is actually an &#34;FM&#34; tuner.  I had it on my Thunderbolt, but can't seem to find it now for my DNA phone.  It is a live FM radio tuner, no streaming thing,  just live FM. Real kind of FM radio.  In fact it was called FM Radio, and had a lil tuner on the screen you could tune to any broadcast frequency at any time and listen to live radio, news, sports and all.  No selecting the kind of music, and all that.  just RADIO.!!  This isn't it.!  sorry.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great adventure movie. All the superheros were the best. Don't miss out on seeing this movie. It's a must see.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book, I hope she writes more! Non stop story, wow, I hope there is a fourth and fifth book!
1451673442|5.0|Best book I've read in years.  I highly recommend it to all my friends and family.  Truly life changing in its simplicity.
1616550414|5.0|i gave this as a gift for a reddit gift swap, so i haven't been able to enjoy this product myself, though i really really really want it,
1439181780|4.0|Recommended to those seeking answers.  Not as powerful as &#34;Magic&#34; by Rhonda Byrne, which is truly life changing by its simplicity.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoy playing. On some levels you think you have then you don't and you start again, it's like reading a good book and you can't put it down.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Honestly, I never made it to the end. I wouldn't say I hated it, but if I walked away, and I rarely walk away, it must have not been that good. Take the two hours and start reading Tender Is the Night - that's time well spent with Fitzgerald. And I normally like Luhrman - Well, not Australia...who could like Australia?
B00E00GCF8|5.0|I was skeptical at first with this new live album from the band as I don't particularly like the production on Rust in peace live but this one sounded much better. Certainly there are overdubbed on the vocal but trust me, it's very little and nothing major compare to Big 4 DVD and RIP live DVD.<br /><br />Instrumental wise there's no denying that Shawn Drover along with Chuck Behler are two weakest drummers on Megadeth but that doesnt mean he couldnt pull it out. For most of part, he just follows what's on the record without adding much fill in like Jimmy De Grasso did on Rude awakening. Chris Broderick is more than capable of pulling any solos note to note and the thing I like about him is that he's not trying to improve or alternate the solos much unlike the previous 2 guitarist Al Pitrelli and Glen Drover. The double Dave has always been spot on when it comes to Guitar and bass playing, just like in any previous live DVD, they just nailed everything perfectly.<br /><br />I hear some people complaining about the bass being too loud, or vocal is terrible etc etc, and ironically when Megadeth put out DVD that sounded too perfect (Sofia & Blood in the water), these people will claim there are too many studio fix, so either way you can never please anyone especially those who always looking for negative aspect of every release. Just be grateful that the band is still alive and well after freakin 30 years and consistently putting out new record and touring.<br /><br />_\M/
0316228532|5.0|I am very happy with this book. Rowling had me hooked with the Harry Potter Series. It is a good read but some people who aren,t acquainted with British Traditions and culture may find it a bit of a bore. So take the story for it's face value and enjoy the intricacies of daily life in a British village
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was a good movie but it seemed like the creators tried a little too hard to give the wow ending
B0089LOKHG|2.0|Ther was so much build up for this book and to me it was a disappointment. If you like Julian(which i do) dont read this. Also theres no real ending. I had to write my own
1401938906|5.0|This is like a combination of wonderful ideas that work if you work it.  Check it our for yourself and see.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|To get the 5 stars, to me in this game the accomplished missions should be replaced by a new one like in the game of minions rush.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I bought as a gift for a friend.<br />He loves it and we listen to it in the car whenever we go anywhere.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed it but it clearly was not his best work.  It was, however, better than Fall of the Giants.
B008XG1X18|5.0|easy to use. great comments and all around great ideas. I follow everyone from facebook. easy access on my kindle anywhere and anytime I have an idea. if you have a concern don't and just get the app.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Tracy captures the essence of a melancholy holiday experience.<br />A must for any holiday music collection. Get it before its longer available.
B001BANK32|5.0|This book was so beautiful written on so many levels! The way each character  was clearly thought through and  developed really made your feel like you were experiencing the girls along with them! Fantastically written!
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|My friend and I have been watching a couple of episodes per week.  It says a lot that we can hardly wait to see the next one.  This has been a winner, full of human errors, tragedies, and triumphs.  Just enough characters to keep things moving, not so many that it's confusing. Warning:  it will not make you more confident about Washington DC behavior!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|They're not kidding when they brag about saving keystrokes. Creating anything more than just a terse e-mail response used to be painful to the point that I would mostly avoid it. Not anymore. In fact, I removed the default &quot;sent from my mobile&quot; signature from my e-mail client now that I am almost equally proficient as on a desktop keyboard. Devs have also been fairly responsive to user quibbles.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Funny, action, plot, character plots, acting....awesome.  I hope they plan on making more.  Watched the 3D version with set up in basement and I thought the special effects were even better in 3D.  For action movies, this is a must have.
B00F91H15W|1.0|Only watched because I think Emma Watson is an awesome actress, and I supposed she did the character justice; portraying her as materialistic and vapid as she is in real life. But the movie just sucked. It glamorized the thievery and was rather annoying to watch. Regret spending the money to rent it .
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is a quick, fun read. Really enjoyed it. Holds your attention to the very last page. .
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Love, love, love this cd!!! Can't think of any song that I don't like on this one at all!! Get it!
B00821PCJS|5.0|From the first episode of this series I was hooked. I like all the actors on the show and the parts they play.<br />The who story is interesting. A god mystery of why and where the aliens came from. I hope the series stays on TV.<br />I will definitely continue to watch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|For someone who has no experience with cancer or a loved one with cancer, this is something you don't think you need to think about. It's like a person from our generation contemplating the Holocaust. It's in the past and has no effect on us, so it doesn't matter. But then again, it does. We have to think about the people who suffered the holocaust and those suffering from cancer because they need our thoughts and prayers! This book gives me a starting point to start thinking about cancer patients an the difficulties they face every day.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Keeps you wanting to play more. This game is really cool. The graphics are great on the Kindle Fire HD.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was an amazing recount of what it takes to be one of the elite fighting men of the us military, Marcus did a wonderful job of telling his friends story and they will be forever remembered for their heroism. Well done Marcus
B00004Y6NT|5.0|The sound of Dire Straits is so unique that you'll recognize the music almost right away, after giving away all my vinyl back in the 80s I'm building my CD collection with many of the albums I had then.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|At first I had a hard time trying to figure out where in the world this movie was going.  So many story lines!  But eventually I was able to put the pieces of the puzzle together and became glued to the screen, wondering what was going to happen next.  No other movie has given me more to think about.  I think the second time around will be a treat, since the puzzle pieces will fit together quicker.
B0000029AL|4.0|If you grew up in the late 60's / early 70's there are some bands and albums that are almost a requirement to have, this is one of them.
B006WZLCZ4|5.0|Both babies (14 mo and 20 mo) played with these all weekend long...BIG HIT! Nicely made, sturdy and love the wood.
B0000029AP|5.0|Early Aerosmith was great to listen to and this is one of those you've got to have, Joe Perry is awesome on the guitar and even better when you've got a good set of headphones on.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Blueray is great! When David Bowie turned he almost poked me in the eye. Favorite move from my child hood. I got a good price and really fast delivery .
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It was an awesome read, I never followed Steve jobs and by reading this I am mesmerized at his way of thinking and acting.
B004P1JDJO|4.0|DRIVE offers some interesting ideas that are counter to the popular belief about what motivates us. The book is well laid out and quite thought provoking. I liked the examples of scientific studies as well as the stories of individuals who were thinking outside the box.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Great! No problem out of this lovely classic CD. It was brand new like the description of the product stated.
0099579936|5.0|I love this book, had already read it before but had to buy it. It looked almost brand new when it came in the mail.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Love it and although I was sore for awhile after doing, that is how you know it is working! I recommend it!
0345803507|5.0|I have read the book before but had to buy it. The book was in great condition when I got it.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|We own the Swedish movies, but we also watched the Daniel Craig version and liked it as well.  We're just rounding out our home collection.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Fantastic movie! This is a classic movie that is standard viewing in most philosophy classes because of it's parallels to Classic Plato thought. Watch this movie, and try not to question your grasp on reality.... good luck
B000VAPZM2|5.0|My kids love this movie they can't put it down also I would recommend it to anyone that has a child
B004GJXQ20|5.0|This is awesome.  Highly recommended. I've seen the series and it is practically identical but you get more out of the book.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book was boring.<br />I hated it everyone talked like it was the best thing on earth...<br />The ending was just disappointing. Maybe just watching the movie would be better.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|3 weeks now...email support has suggested fixes...none have helped...found others online...still not able to cast...<br /><br />router = Netgear AC1450: configured to broadcast SSID, AP mode enabled, Chromecast does show up as an attached device<br /><br />TV screen = \\"ready to cast\\"<br /><br />Chromecast app on HP Pavilion dm1 indicates \\"connected\\"<br /><br />have power cycled computer, chromecast, tv...many times...<br /><br />oh well, $35 for a useless plastic dongle<br /><br />Update: changed from 1 star to 2...because I discovered I can cast from a different computer on the same network that is in a different room. So far, the only difference between the two computers that I have identified is the one that can cast has only one version of the Chrome browser installed whereas the laptop from which I cannot cast has two -- the same version of Chrome as the other computer PLUS Chrome Canary which Google tech suggested I try.<br /><br />So, not completely useless but not what I need/want.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I would have to repeat all of the praises to this book. Excellent writing, an uplifting story and inspiration - whether you run barefoot or not...
0307352145|5.0|Wish I had read it when I was 18, but of course that was many years back. Extremely useful in family life, partner and organizational endeavours.
0061928356|5.0|This was one of the books everyone really enjoyed.  We still talk about it some, months later. Tells of a mother's love.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|It seems like no form of typing really 'gets' me. It still takes a few tries to get many of the words I type, which stinks.
B006Z00R1Q|1.0|Not a good movie, nothing good to write about it. I had to make sure it wasn't the first one several times
B0016OMFNY|5.0|What could be better music than The Traveling Wilburys?  Best era, Best musicians, glad I grew up in the sixties.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Imagine finding out that a lot of what you think is true just ISN&#34;T and that you have more abilities and so much more power to manifest in your life than you ever thought possible.  If that sounds good to you, READ THIS BOOK!  It's easy (and fun) to read and the &#34;experiments&#34; are eye-opening.  The tone is just scientific enough to reassure the skeptics but not so deep that it loses the layman.  Pam Grout has hit this one out of the park -- Well done!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game. It is challenging but you are not limited by time. Definitely a must for young or old.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John is a long time favorite.  Such an outstanding talent.  I listen to this CD over and over when I drive 25 miles every day.
0817439390|4.0|Like the contents of the book but some pages have printing faults or damage - not major but still annoying - will try to return it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A heart wrenching story told from a dog's point of view. I could not put it down. Highly recommend!!  I laughed, I cried.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just can't put this game down I play at night I play after work I wake up to play some more
0812550757|5.0|The series is a valuable set for sci fi readers.  I hope to continue reading  them all!  Thank you much
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Excellent !!! It will be a treasured keepsake for a long time. I enjoyed it very much !!<br />Kathyrn. Thank you.
0544104404|5.0|Grandmother is a 24 year Kindergarten teacher. we ordered it for our grandson's birthday. He reads it to his 3 year old brother EVERY NIGHT!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|The movie is very colorful, vibrant and great soundtrack.  The company dleivered exactly as described.  Order was fulfilled on time, and the packaging was enough to keep the DVD safe, but not environmentally unfriendly!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I liked this movie. life, love, sick, sexy, and so on.. make me think one more for my life and my merrage.
B000FC130E|4.0|This was a good read though at times quite violent and gory. The plot is interesting with some good surprises
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! Great variety and the selections by both Laurie and guest artists were so uniquely done.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard replacement in my opinion is the best one out there.  I downloaded several before getting this one and I'll tell you now that this is the first one I should have since it will be the only one I use!  Super easy to learn and the features are superb.
0143123173|5.0|I gave this book to my 20 year old son who had watched all the episodes of the TV series.<br />He loved it and wants to read the rest. He said they are much better than the show.
B004YXE438|4.0|Great pictures and lots of options to keep one amused. Kept my friend up most of the night trying to finish one of your puzzles.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|Always thought Harry Nilsson a great artist.  Very glad to have such a complete collection, with alternate takes and liner notes.
B00CATONCA|5.0|perfect!!!!for all fan of walking dead this is a must buy.. ive been waitingg for so long for this. thanks
B00330UFQS|5.0|I purchased this album because I could not get the title  song out my head.<br />I guess I am getting old, or Country and Rock are heading in the same direction, but this is a solid fantastic album.
1476734941|5.0|This seems very easy to do.  I love the fact that it's flexible, you can fit it into your week however it works for you.  Also the idea that with intermittent fasting at two days per week, you're never more that a few hours from the next morning, when you can eat whatever you want.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|This girl can sing. Every song is a jewel, believe me my wife played the album over and over for weeks and I did not get burned out.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|It was offered as a kindle download and it reads nice on the kindle reader.  What else can I say but I love it!
B005ZMTYBY|5.0|I have always loved this movie, but never owned it.  Now that I have a child who is at a great age for this movie it was time to take the plunge.  I was going to my normal itunes account, but my wife redirected me to Amazon and I am glad she did.  This is perfect because you can stream it any time you want.  You also can load it onto one device and if you have an iPad and AppleTV then you can stream to the AppleTV through the iPad, basically giving you access to your content properly and legally through just about any means conceivable.  Also, you can't beat the price.  It's nice that Amazon doesn't try to push you to use their systems like Apple does and from a household that has an equal number of units that are either PC/Android or Apple the freedom to use your own content when and where you want is a breath of fresh air.
B009UNH0EM|5.0|Needed a extra charger for my Bluetooth Voyager Legend , for work and this cable was perfect match for my headset.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I choose this rating because the product outshined what I expected. I liked everything about it! I would recommend this product to all my friends that like final fantasy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm a solitaire addict...use it on my cell while waiting for doc appt or in bathroom(LOL) or whenever.  Good cell version!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good acting, great plot.  And a wonderful surprise ending. Definitely want to watch it with friends. Glad I rented it.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|The Grand Canyon shows off it's great beauty in 3-D, especially in the<br />beginning of this 45 minute movie with it's added 3-D graphics.
B001XUYA0W|5.0|Terrific acting, great cast, great plot. Boston is one of the stars, and the story shows how the pain of the past can twist our humanity.
0812993845|4.0|Okay, I read the many negative reviews, and maybe I'm just shallow, but I loved this book.  I read it on an airplane and it kept me entertained the whole three hours.  It made me laugh out loud in many places which made my seatmate look at me nervously. (Most people don't laugh hysterically while on a plane, I guess.)  Yes, the characters are selfish and do dumb things, and yes, the situations are implausible.  Look, it's not \\"War and Peace,\\" and it's not meant to be...it's just a fun, lightweight read. Enjoy it and laugh!  It's brain candy!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I love John Mayer's new CD.  His range of music constantly amazes me.  I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game, it makes you think.  I always enjoy a good challenge and this game gives me one.
0399255370|5.0|I just happened upon this book window shopping at a mall and read through it and it brought me back to my childhood joy of coloring. The illustrations are great and the storyline is very entertaining, a definite read for any age and for parents to show there children colors.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|good but sad  So is real life though.  Didn't read all as it was breaking my heart.  Too graphic for me.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Every year this documentary is shown on television on Earth Day. After seeing it a few times, I wanted my own copy to share with friends and those concerned with the current state of the food supply. The politics that drive it, the 'factory farming' and the abhorrent treatment of the animals in it will open your eyes. After watching this, and realizing all the 'medicines' that are systematically dosed to all these animals, it makes you wonder why you 'didn't see it coming' regarding a lot of our current health problems and those of our children.
0743201140|5.0|This book along with all other Strengths books are so helpful in gaining understanding of what the 34 themes of strengths are and how to apply them.. book comes with a code and is useful when needing a reference
B009NH6JRE|4.0|Really good season but not great. I liked seasons one and two way better but it's still good and a must see for fans
0802473156|5.0|Understanding how others communicate and &#34;feel&#34; love is of utmost importance otherwise one is speaking in a language not understood or felt and we all know what happens with miscommunication....
B000UBMSB8|5.0|Awesome classic sci fi film! This is as good as scifi gets. A must see for any fan of sci fi!
159562015X|5.0|KNOW your strengths and understand that everyone around you has signature themes or strengths which might be different from your own.. if you manage people.. it is helpful to understand how to play to your strengths and maximize others..
1400031354|5.0|A good read, this series gives a great look into a culture and a way of seeing and understanding the world that is new to me, an informing variation.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Just started playing tonight &amp; I can't seem to stop. Its a very addictive puzzle game. Had to stop to leave feedback for the bonus level! Lol
B008JFUO4U|3.0|It was a different take on a sci fi,mankind's doom and struggle to survive. The design and flying machines were great,who knows,maybe we get a glimpse of the future.I was left thinking there should be more.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|The story took too long to take off and then ended abruptly... should have picked up quicker - more story line less character development.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|We are long-time fans of Robert Downey Jr., and each of these movies has only convinced us more in that decision. Great chemistry between all the actors. The kid from Tennessee was fabulous! Let's hope we see more of him in the future.
B000SVZIR6|4.0|Anna and the King has been a favorite of mine.  While I love the musical version there is something about the sense of historical by keeping it more dramatic.  I love the cinematography. One person can change the course of history.  Foster and Fat bring a reserved sweetness to the screen. If you have only seen the musical take the opportunity to watch this... Your brain will add the sound track!
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Hey! It's Castle and Beckett at their finest. We own the entire series, and can share it with friends and family.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|The installation was easy, it works well with the kinect sensor and the delivery time was very fast.  I would recommend this product.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Hey, if you're a fan, it's Star Trek! And it's very good. They picked the right actors to star in these 2 newer Star Trek movies.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|They movie was super awesome and was packaged carefully too. Its no replacement to the original series but it is just as exciting and psychologically moving.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Got this recently on a recommendation and it works beautifully.<br /><br />I might deduct half or a quarter of a star because the fan included is a bit noisy, but I suspect that's my motherboard not controlling the fan speed gracefully, so I don't really blame this product.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|I loved this movie a lot. It gave it an overall great feel. Shinji is still annoying. New characterMari is great.  I can watch this movie back to back.
B00448SE4S|5.0|One of the best films I saw in a long while. Perfect metaphor for a teenage mind - the 80s meet the present.
1936608898|5.0|Well, you may have noticed I have purchased multiple copies of this book.  I attended a workshop on eating this way to give me good health as I age.  I don't know why doctors just hand you a pill when you have health issues.  I guess that's what they think you want.  You still have the health issues, but the pills just mask the disease or disorder.  So the disease continues to sicken your body, and often cause more problems that they mask with more pills.  Not the way I want to live my life as I age.  I want to be active and get to pursue my interests.  I had no idea when I ate this way, I would lose 27 lbs in four months as well!!!  When people see how great I look, they want to read my book, so I have purchased close to 10 of them and pass them out to friends so they can read about it too, and change their health for the better.  Pg. 82 lists 75 diseases and health issues that are caused by foods...migraines, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, RA, IBS, MS, high blood pressure, high cholesterol,  heart disease, ADHD.  Why not make your body function properly with the right foods instead of pills?!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each level has its own unique twist.  It is a challenge to figure it out. I just wish there were more!
B00AB7IA1S|5.0|IT is a very fun game! However, my tablet got a glitch during the 4th world, so I couldn't pass the game.
140006922X|4.0|I do like this book, but at times it feels as though it strays a bit from the secular approach at the view of a religious figure, and more to a venerating approach. I can understand the attempt to relay the compassion his followers had toward him, but some of the rhetoric used feels more personal than historical.<br /><br />Very fantastic read for anyone who is interested in learning more about the history of Jesus as a man, and other messiah figures.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game. Recommended for everybody of all ages!!!Except it stinks that you have a limited amount of time to buy the special characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|All the fun of minecraft to go!  The boys love it!  They play all the time!  We haven't had any issues!
B00ENYCQX8|5.0|As the description says, it opens .mobi and .epub files on the kindle fire. I'm very happy with the app, it serves its purpose very well.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|This item works good. It is a little light duty to be used exclusively for a hearing impaired person, but good value for the money.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very cute but captivating puzzle experience. Going to have to buy more versions of the game to keep playing! Addiction!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|In this book I probably cried ten days after the sad  parts .It was so sad.<br /><br />I love the person who made this book. This book inspired me to be nice to everyone with or without problems<br /><br />  LOVE ZA`NIYAH
B00594XOZU|4.0|I've lost full contact with my boyfriend it won't let me log in FIX IT please fix it...I need some way to talk to people
0385349947|5.0|I think this is a must read for all women.  I am 29, hoping to start a family while working in a stressful position.  It really energized me!  I also encouraged my friends, some who are stay at home moms, to read this.  It is powerful.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Nice and easy reading  now I have to start to watch the show I am hooked like to red more
B003NX75B8|5.0|It didn't make me cry like every other John Green and/or David Levithan book has in the past, but the two authors together created a story that touched me in a way that not very many books have.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great time waster!<br /> excellent way to spend some time during football or the baseball playoffs! Great for teaching kids logical moves.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Star studded!!  Perfect blend of comedy and action!!  Left you wanting more and more!  Can't wait to watch Red 2!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It's an Emmy winner in every category.  All good actors, good story lines.  Looking forward to 4th season.  Good luck.
B004GJ1XU2|1.0|I did not like it because I really could not relate and I thought there was no plot. Could not fiqure out who the characters were until almost the middle of the movie. My husband liked the movie and could relate in some ways.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun for little girls who want horses but can't have one and they find out what it's like to have a horse
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've only used a few times but it is extremely easy to use and very similar to Rosetta Stone but without the huge pricetag.
0152465049|5.0|Condition was better than described.  Delivery was way ahead of schedule. I got the translation I wanted in the edition I wanted.  Perfect for my present for my youngest sister's 50th birthday!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I loved it!  In fact, I ordered a second one - to give as a gift.  If you like &#34;Classic Country&#34;, you'll love this album!
B00932HEX2|1.0|Please return my 1.99 as I couldn't get this episode to play! Thank you. All the others work so far.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|FIFTY SHADES DARKER: BOOK TWO by E.L. James<br />MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE (ON FIRE)!!<br />Ten minutes after I finished book one, I had the second downloaded. AND I LOVED IT EVEN MORE. I found more than ever, that I sympathized with Christian Grey. He is more than a wounded soul - he's actually broken. In book two, we begin to see Christian heal as he opens his mind to love and having his first \\"normal relationship.\\" Once again, we get a lot of sex, A LOT OF SEX! However, this book has a softer, more romantic side. My favorite chapter is CHAPTER 19. Christian returns after his helicopter goes down; his reconciliation with his family and Ana is beautiful. Their return to the Red Room of Pain after Ana agrees to marry him is hot and romantic. Again, the email banter is tremendous - quite possibly the best part of all three books! Once again the dialogue is poor at best, and WHO EDITED THIS??!!  If you are looking for literary genius - it isn't here. But still, JUST FUN TO READ!
B00B52F278|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my fiancé.  We both absolutely loved the series, and were sorry to see it end (despite history).  Very well-done!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|FIFTY SHADES FREED: BOOK THREE by E.L. James<br />MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE (AND IS ON FIRE!)!!<br />So, Fifty Shades - is a guilty pleasure for sure. Book three is my least favorite only because I am not fan of flashback writing. Christian and Ana are now married - which is about 3 months later!  They have honeymooned through Europe, and have now returned to their lives in Seattle. Christian is still quite controlling, demanding that Ana change her name at work and dictating her work and social life. But he loves her so deeply, I guess it's forgivable. The best part of this book was the epilogue, because as always I want my happy ending. The bonus chapter is also great.  In this chapter, we get chapters 1 and 2 from book one told from Christian's POV, which is hysterical!  I would buy book one AGAIN written from Christian's POV because it was just so entertaining!  I look forward to FIFTY SHADES - THE MOVIE IN 2014!  I will be wearing a plum dress, and having a ball with my friends on opening night!<br />For all the critics out there - keep in mind, this is fiction! Lose your hang ups about sex and just enjoy this series for what it is - a really sexy book with a charming love story!
B000068VHP|5.0|I bought this recently, I had on CD at one point and then got nostalgic and bought the MP3... Gotta love these guys! Still good!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|FIFTY SHADES OF GREY: BOOK ONE by E.L. James<br />MY HEART IS FULL OF LOVE (AND IS ON FIRE)!!<br />I know one thing for sure - with regard to Fifty Shades of Grey - you either LOVE IT or HATE IT. I happen to be in the club that loved it, and here's why.  This is the book series that brought me back to reading on a regular basis. Is this excellent writing? NO. Is the story mesmerizing? YES. Would I want a real Christian Grey in my life? MAYBE.  Does the story contain a lot of sex? HELL YES!  I found Christian Grey an interesting character. I was able to look past the S&M theme and see a wounded soul find the woman that changes his world. This story has been told over and over - an innocent girl finds a very rich man and is swept off her feet! Book one puts a whole new twist on that! The email banter is my most favorite part. Ana and Christian are able to really connect through words. Now, the dialogue was beyond bad and the editing was atrocious - but overall the story is fun and a little bit exciting. Maybe it's time we all open our minds when it comes to sex - and just enjoy the ride!!
B001DPC4S2|5.0|I mean its Van Morrison- you know its going to be great. If your on the fence, you should buy it!
B0060D3BWK|5.0|GREAT movie from my childhood. It's so hard to find it anywhere else so I was very happy. Thanks Amazon!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|This is a very complex book to read but I liked it. Im glad that it was so easy to obatin this book on Amazon for my Kindle app. on my iPad.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|It Is good and arrived in time<br />and this sale is amazing<br /><br />Iam using it for my iphone 5 and it working good
B00004YA66|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of &#34;time travel&#34; ... this film is done masterfully.  It's stars are incredible and believable, and it would appeal to any age group.  Well worth the price.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great games for kids and adults.  We seniors have to keep our brains sharp and this does stimulate the old cells...
B004C03L4G|5.0|I love angels!! I love reading these precious words, encouragements, guidance for each day!!<br />Thank you Doreen!! This is a daily blessing!!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|For a75 yr old lots of fun...When I have a restless night just pick up my kindle and play for about 15 mins, and I can go back to sleep.  thanks
B008Y212PI|5.0|it is a fun game a bit chalingen but it is good I like it is well wreath the money
B007N8RULO|1.0|I enjoy regular solitaire much better, a nother good sleep method just play a few games , I find it boring
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Absolutely wonderful.  BBC just blows Natural Geographic off the planet with this series.  Recommend it to everyone who loves nature shows.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This story had a great plot and emotion. Not too deep, perfect for the ride home. I was left wanting no more than an epilogue :)
B000002VMH|5.0|I had this CD when it first case out, and it was one of my favorites.  But it was stolen from my car with about a dozen other CDs way back in the 90s.  I finally decided to replace it, and the music is just as good as I remember.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is great for math home work and if u want top use of good and thing else thts fine to but this is a great app for anybody who want to use it
B00915G6R6|5.0|Fabulous series.<br /><br />Excellent acting by all characters - even minor roles<br /><br />Tension - drama - intrigue - laughter -  and Kalinda's eyes !!
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Not only is the picture much more colorful and the image has been respectfully cleaned up, but the 3d was very good also! I watched it and thought Disney's use of 3d actually made me see things I never paid attention to before. Such as when Ursula is being defeated and you can see her face while she is taking down the ship at the end and lots more! Whenever a character moves you see the bubbles in 3d also. This is definitely a keeper! My first and favorite Disney movie finally got the 3d treatment it deserves!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Having been in the IT field for a number of years I found many eery similarities between situations that I've encountered and those in the book.  There are some great insights and strategies on how to manage through difficult situations without the preachy and formulaic &#34;Joe did this and it had this result...&#34; scenarios found in many management books.  If nothing else it may just make you feel a bit less alone when navigating the many challenges and interpersonal politics within the IT field...
0345495004|4.0|Very, very interesting book.  Well written and interesting.  I like a book that is enjoyable to read but also teaches me something and shows me a little insight into a world that I don't know much about (FLW and architecture).  Fascinating lives are documented in this book, love that it's a true story, a love story too.
B001BWYZWA|5.0|Rudy in ble-ray is a must see, I never expected to see a old movie with such quality A plus
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I adquired my Kindle device few months ago, however since I got the Kindle for Android, I rarely use my Kindle device because I don't carry it everywhere everytime.<br />So I think it is a very useful application.
B005FISBTO|5.0|A great series to watch. Season 6 was very good, seeing Dexter at his high school reunion in the first episode was very funny, that alone was worth purchasing the DVD. The main villains for this season was Colin Hanks & Edward James Olmos.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|I did not like the product the second I got it out of the packaging.  The leather is cheap, like vinyl or some artificial fabric and the bulky nature of the product left me regretting the purchase.  The topper was the lack of a port for the power cable connection to charge the kindle WITH the case closed.  I plugged it in with the case open and just thought -  No way! I can do better for a $32 purchase.  It's returned.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'd never done this type of puzzle before,but it's lots of fun!  Very good tutorial is included.  If you enjoy logic puzzles as I do, you will love these.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love how you could swing around the city. You get to beat up bad guys. recommend you get this game today
B008D28HYS|5.0|I was stunned by how great this app is. I love this kind of puzzle, and this is the best I have ever seen it done. The controls are easy to use, and the navigation is simple. I found no glitches at all. But my favorite thing about this app is how challenging the puzzles themselves are. I have found that most of these apps are only pleasant distractions because they are fairly easy. Not this one! The normal levels takes some brain power, and the difficult levels take real work. This is my new favorite app, and I will be playing it for hours!
B00E9P959O|5.0|I wanted a good 24 hours after listening to the new version in earnest before I expressed my opinion. I listened to both versions in vinyl. While I appreciate the 2002 release for what it was and the meaning behind a new rush album after Neil's tragedy.<br />The remix offers a totally different plethora of sound. An example was ceiling unlimited far from the best song on the album but the remix version offers intricate guitar awesome bass lines and technical drumming I totally missed on the first version.<br />I appreciate that this version allows the listener to concentrate on individual instruments.<br />My only complaint is Geddys vocals seem a bit polished but I hear harmonies in this one I missed prior.<br />As a Rush fan I couldn't be happier

0763644765|4.0|Leslie Patricelli, Potty (Candlewick, 2010)<br /><br />Of the batch of library books we got out this time (and as I write this, I'm three batches behind, I think), Potty was both my favorite and the Bean's. The illustrations are engaging and fun, our toddler narrator has a quick wit about him (and wonderful facial expressions), and the story is very simple without ever feeling like the author is talking down to her audience. We read this one at least a dozen times the first time we got it out of the library, and if it's as popular after a second round, we'll end up adding it to the permanent collection, even if the Bean is already well into toilet training at this point--we just plain like it at book time. Fun stuff indeed. *** ½

B0000AM6IY|2.0|West Side Story (Jerome Robbins et al., 1961)<br />[originally posted 16May2000]<br /><br />(If you don't, somehow, know the plot of either West Side Story or Romeo and Juliet, skip this review.)<br /><br />As the glory days of the musical were winding down, and musicals were more adapted from Broadway than written specifically for the screen, it seems that a cadre of musical directors got together and set down some ground rules for making musicals in America in the 1960s. The first rule was that singing voice was less important than stage presence. And while West Side Story isn't quite as bad about it as, say, the shrieking harridans who make up the thoroughly awful off-key chorus of My Fair Lady, there's still a good deal of off-key, annoying, baleful whining running through Robbins' adaptation of his own stage play. At least the lead parts were cast with people who could sing (Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer, both of whom can stay on key, unlike much of the supporting cast).<br /><br />Now that my complaints about on-key singing are out of the way, it's actually not a bad script. It's not Romeo and Juliet (hey guys, aren't both of the lovers supposed to die in the end?), and leaves out some of the finest plot twists and most endearing characters from that play. Needed more time for big dance numbers, I guess. I would have preferred the nurse. **

B00D6BN9NK|5.0|This was very good - full of action and adventure. Unfortunately Bruce is aging but having the son involved might open up the franchise for more Die Hard movies.
B00015BJ0E|4.0|As usual with this type of this one meets that one, type of recordings, this probably isn't the best work of either player, but its quite good. I have a cassette tape of this around somewhere that I hadn't played in years and this was on my mind after I recently bought a CD of Milt Jackson and Cannonball Adderly. The Bags & Trane CD has a great rhythm section of Hank Jones, Paul Chambers (one of my favorite 1950s bass players) and Connie Kay, so its an all star lineup. Good solid performances by all. Interesting historically, at least to me, is that at the time of this recording, the big star was Milt Jackson and John Coltrane was getting to be well-known, but still sort of an up-and-coming guy to watch. If you like either of them, you won't be disappointed by this recording.
B000TFINY6|5.0|Great product and great show. The blu-ray is definitely worth the buy. Especially considering it's the same price as DVD.
1476734941|5.0|The 'Fast Diet' is not about 'quick' - it's about fasting for two days a week (but still eating on those days, but less than normal).  The two days need not be concurrent...It really works and is not so much a 'diet' as a new way of living.  For example one week you could fast on a Tuesday and a Friday if they are 'quiet' days in your life;  the next week you could fast on a Monday and a Wednesday, and so on;  or choose the same two days each week.  First time is hard, then it is easy...Body will stabilize at your normal weight.
B0036S4B6M|1.0|no real story here just a monotone  account of a boring year in minimum security. Lacks any depth and penmanship. the netflix series has cast undeserved hype to this poor dissertation on prison life
B000RZIGVS|3.0|This is about the physical product itself and NOT the story.<br /><br />It is very cheaply put together, The green \\"cases\\" are in three sections and they chip and brake with little or no effort.  The plastic covering breaks apart very easily (separates at the corners).<br /><br />Each disc is labeled with the season, disc of that season, and the episodes on that disc.  So unless you know have the whole series episode guide ready, you will be flipping through discs to find certain episodes.  But if you want to watch the series from start to end, it is not bad at all.

B008220D5K|3.0|In THIS IS 40, writer/producer/director Judd Apatow revives the family of Pete (Paul Rudd) and Debbie (real life wife Leslie Mann), the dysfunctional couple that played second banana in his previous hit [[ASIN:B000TZJBPQ Knocked Up]].  And in this repeat, real life daughters Maude and Iris once again play the brooding offspring.  With Pete and Debbie both reaching their 40th birthdays simultaneously, THIS IS 40 depicts the couple's reaction to this milestone--coupled with outside factors, from Pete trying to keep his troubled record label afloat, to Debbie discovering she's pregnant.  And the results are:  total ambivalence.  They're up, they're down; they're going to split, they've reconciled.  They lay an egg for a 40th birthday party, they share a good laugh in the ER.  He's worried about hemorrhoids, she's concerned she no longer looks sexy.  And so on, culminating in an overall feeling of. . .nada.<br /><br />The supporting cast is a mile wide and an inch deep, beginning with Albert Brooks as Pete's freeloading father, the total opposite of John Lithgow, playing Debbie's very distant dad.  Jason Segel is Debbie's trainer, Chris O'Dowd is one of Pete's obnoxious employees, and Megan Fox supplies eye candy in spades.  Even the voice of Tatum O'Neal is furnished as a realtor helping the couple decide whether or not they should downgrade.  There are humorous moments, there are boring moments, but overall there are non-moments; THIS IS 40 tries to depict a couple having a midlife crisis, but with a story so ambivalent not even Pete and Debbie bother to care.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
1781162646|5.0|Characters, characters, characters; that's what writing is about and that's Stephen King's stronghold on the writing world. He makes you want to turn the pages, to get involved with his characters, to want to hang with them (well...most of them anyway lol!).<br /><br />I finished this in 2 days and wanted more. Hated that it had to end. Sure it was a little tidy at the end, but the journey there was worth it.<br /><br />I don't read everything he's ever written but pick and choose. I'm glad I chose this one.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The best season yet! I adore this show and the third season tested the entire cast. All the character arcs where fleshed out and we said goodbye to quite a few. Love it!

I was somewhat pessimistic when I first started reading it, thinking &#34;this is weird&#34; because I am so attuned to picturing the characters in my own way from reading all her novels. however, I did enjoy this book and was surprised to find myself looking for the next one.

B00F91RYL8|5.0|I expected this to be a spin off of the &#34;28 Days Series&#34; or some other &#34;B - Caliber&#34; zombie movie.  But I was sorely mistaken.  The actual story line was such that I was on the edge of my seat for more than 90% of the movie.  It was worth the wait, but I also wished I didn't wait so long.  Recommended for anyone who needs a good story to talk about afterward.

B005WUHAX8|4.0|Bought this case before I went on a cruise and it was amazing to have for snorkeling pictures. I was nervous about this case with the numerous bad reviews I found. So far we have not had any issues. I read all the instructions and watched videos online to ensure I was putting on/taking off properly.<br />The audio is ok, but a little dampened with the case on. Also, my cheap chargers don't fit with the case on. I do not have a problem with the original factory iphone charger. Overall I would buy this again and especially recommend it for underwater photos and videos!

1451695195|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />With more than 6,000 reviews of the book \\"Proof of Heaven\\" in such a shot time, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that it is the most desired subject of the century. It is a daunting task for one such as I \\"of very small brain\\" as Winnie the Poo put it, to even think of writing a review that anyone would find in an amazon.com search except for those who \\"See all of my reviews.\\" I therefore differ to Mike Adams review that I think is the best review that has been given. It has value for non-readers because they will get the message of the book without reading it.<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven' documents existence of afterlife, multiverse, intelligent life beyond Earth, multidimensional realities\\" by Mike Adams<br /><br />(NaturalNews) \\"There's a secret that's much bigger than politics, health freedom, science or even the entire history of the human race. That secret remains entirely unacknowledged -- even condemned -- by the scientific community, and yet it is the single most important secret about everything that is. Yes, everything.<br /><br />That secret is simply this: We all survive the physical death of our bodies. Our consciousness lives on, and upon our death in this Earthly dream, our consciousness transcends this physical reality and experiences an existence so amazing and powerful that the human language cannot even begin to describe it.<br /><br />This is the message from Dr. Eben Alexander, author of the newly-published book, \\"Proof of Heaven.\\" I recently read the book and found it both fascinating and also confirming of several important theories I've been developing about the nature of life and the Creator. (See below.)<br /><br />A lifelong science skeptic who never believed in God, Heaven or consciousness<br />Long before this book was ever written, Dr. Alexander was a practicing neurosurgeon and a lifelong \\"science skeptic.\\" He did not believe in consciousness, free will or the existence of a non-physical spirit. Trained in western medical school and surrounded by medical colleagues who are deeply invested in the materialism view of the universe, Dr. Alexander believed that so-called \\"consciousness\\" was only an illusion created by the biochemical functioning of the brain.<br /><br />This is a view held by virtually all of today's mainstream scientists, including physicists like Stephen Hawking who say that human beings are nothing more than \\"biological robots\\" with no consciousness and no free will.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander would have held this view to his own death bed had it not been for his experiencing an event so bizarre and miraculous that it defies all conventional scientific explanation: Dr. Alexander \\"died\\" for seven days and experienced a vivid journey into the afterlife. He then returned to his physical body, experienced a miraculous healing, and went on to write the book \\"Proof of Heaven.\\"<br /><br />E.coli infection eats his brain<br />It all started when e.coli bacteria infected Dr. Alexander's spinal fluid and outer cerebrum. The e.coli began to literally eat his brain away, and he went into an extremely violent fit of seizures, verbal outbursts and muscular spasms before lapsing into a brain-dead coma.<br /><br />In this coma, he showed zero higher brain activity and was only kept alive via a respirator and IV fluids. The attending physicians soon concluded that Dr. Alexander would die within a matter of days, and that even if he lived, he would be a non-functioning \\"vegetable\\" with limited brain function. Statistically, the death rate for patients with e.coli infections of the brain is 97%.<br /><br />But here's the real shocker in all this: Rather than experiencing nothingness during these seven earth-days of unconsciousness, Dr. Alexander found himself \\"awakening\\" from the dream of his earthly life, suddenly experiencing an incomprehensibly vast expansion of his consciousness in the afterlife.<br /><br />This experience is described in more detail in his book \\"Proof of Heaven,\\" but here are the highlights:<br /><br />* The experience of the afterlife was so \\"real\\" and expansive that the experience of living as a human on Earth seemed like an artificial dream by comparison.<br /><br />* There was no time dimension in the afterlife. Time did not \\"flow\\" as it does in our universe. An instant could seem like eternity, and consciousness could move through what we perceive to be time without effort. (This idea that all time exists simultaneously has enormous implications in understanding the nature of free will and the multiverse, along with the apparent flow of time experienced by our consciousness in this realm.)<br /><br />* The fabric of the afterlife was pure LOVE. Love dominated the afterlife to such a huge degree that the overall presence of evil was infinitesimally small.<br /><br />* In the afterlife, all communication was telepathic. There was no need for spoken words, nor even any separation between the self and everything else happening around you.<br /><br />* The moment you asked a question in your mind, the answers were immediately apparent in breathtaking depth and detail. There was no \\"unknown\\" and the mere asking of a question was instantly accompanied by the appearance of its answers.<br /><br />* There also exists a literal Hell, which was described by Dr. Alexander as a place buried underground, with gnarled tree roots and demonic faces and never-ending torment. Dr. Alexander was rescued from this place by angelic beings and transported to Heaven.<br /><br />God acknowledges the existence of the multiverse<br />The passage of \\"Proof of Heaven\\" I found most interesting is found on page 48, where Dr. Alexander says:<br /><br />Through the Orb, [God] told me that there is not one universe but many -- in fact, more than I could conceive -- but that love lay at the center of them all. Evil was present in all the other universes as well, but only in the tiniest trace amounts. Evil was necessary because without it free will was impossible, and without free will there could be no growth -- no forward movement, no chance for us to become what God longed for us to be. Horrible and all-powerful as evil sometimes seemed to be in a world like ours, in the larger picture love was overwhelmingly dominant, and it would ultimately be triumphant.<br /><br />This passage struck an important cord with me, as I have long believed our universe was created by the Creator as just one of an infinite number of other universes, each with variations on life and the laws of physics. (Click here to read my writings on the Higgs Boson particle, consciousness and the multiverse.) What Dr. Alexander's quote confirms is that our life on planet Earth is a \\"test\\" of personal growth, and that the way to make progress in this test is to overcome evil while spreading love and compassion.<br /><br />Even more, this passage also confirms the existence of free will and even helps answer the question I'm often asking myself: \\"Why are we placed here in a world of such evil and surrounded by ignorance, darkness and deception?\\" The answer appears to be that Earth is a testing ground for souls that have been selected by the Creator for the ultimate test of good versus evil.<br /><br />Earth as a testing ground<br />Although \\"Proof of Heaven\\" doesn't go as far as I'm explaining here, my working theory is that our planet Earth is among the highest evil-infested realms in the grand multiverse. Only the most courageous souls agree to come to Earth by being born into human bodies and stripped of their memories.<br /><br />From there, the challenge of life is multi-faceted:<br /><br />1) Figure out WHO you are and WHY you are here.<br />2) Learn to recognize and overcome EVIL (tyranny, slavery, oppression, Big Government, etc.).<br />3) Learn to spread love, compassion, healing and knowledge.<br /><br />Upon our death, we are judged by a higher power, and that judgment takes into account our performance in these areas. Did we achieve a measure of self-awareness? Did we work to overcome evil? Did we express love and compassion and help uplift others with knowledge and awareness?<br /><br />As you've probably already figured out, the vast majority of humans fail these tests. They die as bitter, selfish, substance-addicted, greed-driven minions of evil who mistakenly thought they were winning the game of life while, in reality, they were losing the far more important test of the Creator.<br /><br />The most important part about living a human life is not acquiring money, or fame, or power over others but rather achieving a high \\"score\\" in this simulation known as \\"life\\" by resisting evil, spreading love and expanding awareness of that which is true.<br /><br />For those who respect life, who practice humility and self awareness, who seek to spread knowledge and wisdom while resisting tyranny, oppression, ignorance and evil, their souls will, I believe, be selected for special tasks in the greater multiverse. That's the \\"real\\" existence. This Earthly life is only a dream-like simulation where your soul interfaces with the crude biology of our planet for a very short time span that's actually the blink of an eye in the larger picture.<br /><br />In reality, you are much more than your body. In fact, your soul is infinitely more aware, intelligent and creative than what can be experienced or expressed through the brain of a human. Trying to experience the full reality of what you are through the limited physical brain matter of a human being is a lot like trying to teach an insect to compose music like Mozart.<br /><br />The multiverse is teeming with intelligent life, including multidimensional beings<br />Dr. Alexander's journey also confirms the existence of intelligent life far beyond Earth. As he explains in Proof of Heaven:<br /><br />I saw the abundance of life throughout the countless universes, including some whose intelligence was advanced far beyond that of humanity. I saw that there are countless higher dimensions, but that the only way to know these dimensions is to enter and experience them directly. They cannot be known, or understood, from lower dimensional space. From those higher worlds one could access any time or place in our world.<br /><br />This not only confirms the existence of other intelligent civilizations throughout our known universe, but more importantly the existence of multidimensional beings who can come and go from our realm as they please.<br /><br />Throughout the cultures of the world, there are countless accounts of advanced beings visiting Earth, transferring technology to ancient Earth civilizations, and possibly even interbreeding with early humans. Even the very basis of Christianity begins with the idea that an omnipresent multidimensional being (God) can intervene at will, and can therefore transcend time and space.<br /><br />Alternative researchers like David Icke also talk about multidimensional beings visiting Earth and infecting the planet with great evil. According to Icke, the globalist controllers of our planet are literally reptilian shape-shifters who have invaded our world for the purpose of controlling and enslaving humanity. Although nothing like this is covered in Dr. Alexander's book, it is not inconsistent with what Dr. Alexander was told by God during his coma... Namely, that there are multidimensional realities, that certain high-vibration beings can traverse those realities at will, and that Earth is infested with a great evil with the specific purpose of testing our character.<br /><br />If all this sounds a little too spooky for you, consider the words of the Bible itself: An upright talking reptilian snake spoke in audible words to Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden, did it not?<br /><br />The science skeptics are wrong (again)<br />Regardless of what you might think about multidimensional beings, intelligent life beyond Earth, and the existence of great evil on our planet, there's one aspect of all this that's crystal clear: The science skeptics are dead wrong.<br /><br />Science \\"skeptics\\" are actually misnamed. They aren't skeptical at all. They simply follow their own religion with its own sacred beliefs that cannot be questioned... ever! Those beliefs include the utter worship of the materialistic view of the universe. Simultaneously, so-called \\"skeptics\\" do not believe they are conscious beings themselves because they believe consciousness is merely an \\"artifact\\" of biochemical brain function.<br /><br />There is no afterlife, they insist. There is no mind-body medicine, the placebo effect is useless, and there's no such thing as premonition, remote viewing or psychic phenomena. Oh yes, and they also insist that injecting yourself with mercury, MSG and formaldehyde via vaccines is actually good for you, that fluoride chemicals are good for the public health and that we should all eat more GMOs, pesticides and synthetic chemicals.<br /><br />It's no surprise these religious cult members of the \\"scientism\\" cult don't believe in an afterlife. That's what allows them to commit genocidal crimes against the human race today via GMOs, experimental medicine, toxic vaccines and other deadly pursuits. In their view, humans have no souls so killing them is of no consequence.<br /><br />As Dr. Alexander says,<br /><br />Certain members of the scientific community, who are pledged to the materialistic worldview, have insisted again and again that science and spirituality cannot coexist. They are mistaken.<br /><br />Well of course they are. The \\"science skeptics\\" are dead wrong about almost everything they claim to advocate. But their biggest mistake of all is in denying the existence of their own souls. Needless to say, they are all going to fail the human experience simulation once they pass on and face judgment. My, what a surprise that will be for those sad souls when they day arrives...<br /><br />I would hate to face God one day after having lived a life of a science skeptic, and then have God ask the question: \\"You doubted ME?\\" How could anyone take a look at the world around them and not see the signs of an intelligent Creator? Even the very laws of physics have been tweaked and fine-tuned in precisely the right balance so that our universe itself can support the formation of stars, and planets, and carbon-based life forms. This is called the \\"Goldilocks Enigma,\\" and there's a wonderful book by that same name written by Paul Davies.<br /><br />No biochemical explanation for Dr. Alexander's experience<br />For those skeptics who may be reading this, Dr. Alexander goes through nine possible biochemical hypotheses for his experiences and then meticulously and scientifically dismisses them all one by one. The result? His experience was REAL. In fact, it was \\"more real\\" than life as a human being.<br /><br />Remember, Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon. This guy knows the physical brain like no one else. The nine medical explanations he considers and dismisses as possible causes for his experience are:<br /><br />1) Primitive brainstem program.<br />2) Distorted recall of memories from the limbic system.<br />3) Endogenous glutamate blockade with excitotoxicity.<br />4) DMT dump.<br />5) Isolated preservation of cortical regions of the brain.<br />6) Loss of inhibitory neurons leading to highly levels of activity among excitatory neuronal networks to generate an apparent \\"ultra-reality.\\"<br />7) Activation of thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstorm to create a hyper-reality experience.<br />8) Reboot phenomenon.<br />9) Unusual memory generation through archaic visual pathways.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander may be the most credible afterlife witness in the history of humanity<br />Dr. Alexander's experience (and subsequent book) is arguably the best-documented case of the afterlife that exists in western science today. The fact that a vivid, hyper-real afterlife was experienced bya science skeptic materialistic brain surgeon who didn't believe in the afterlife -- and who subsequently found the courage to document his experiences and publish them in a book -- adds irrefutable credibility to the experience.<br /><br />This was not some kook seeking fame on a TV show. In fact, his writing this book earned him endless ridicule from his former \\"scientific\\" colleagues. There was every reason to NOT write this book. Only by the grace of God was Dr. Alexander healed of his e.coli infection, restored to normal brain function, and granted the VISION of the afterlife so that he could return to this realm and attempt to put it into words.<br /><br />Personally, I believe Dr. Alexander, and his experience mirrors that of countless others, across every culture, who have reported similar NDEs (Near Death Experiences). There is life after life, and the shift in consciousness of Earthlings that is required to take our species to a higher level of understanding begins, I believe, with embracing the truth of the immortality of our own souls (and the existence of a grand Creator).<br /><br />What does it all mean?<br />Dr. Alexander's spiritual journey gives us a wealth of information that can help provide meaning and purpose in our daily lives.<br /><br />For starters, it means that all our actions are recorded in the cosmos and that there are no secrets in the larger scope of things. You cannot secretly screw somebody over here on Earth and think it won't be recorded on your soul forever. It also means that all our actions will be accounted for in the afterlife. If this message sounds familiar, that's because an identical idea is the pillar of every major world religion, including Christianity.<br /><br />It also means there are people living today on this planet whose souls will literally burn in eternal Hell. There are others whose souls, like Dr. Alexander, will be lifted into Heaven and shown a greater reality. What we choose to do with our lives each and every day determines which path our souls will take after the passing of our physical bodies.<br /><br />What matters, then, is not whether you actually succeed in defeating evil here on Earth, but rather the nature of your character that emerges from all the challenges and tribulations you face. This is all a test, get it? That's why life seems to suck sometimes. It's not a panacea; it's a testing ground for the most courageous souls of all -- those who wish to enter the realm of great evil and hope they can rise above it before the end of their human lifespan.\\" - Mike Adams<br /><br />See all of my reviews. I (Darrell Stoddard) write only about books, events, or motion pictures of enduring significance that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.<br /><br />Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute and saveusa.bizbeyond that of humanity. I saw that there are countless higher dimensions, but that the only way to know these dimensions is to enter and experience them directly. They cannot be known, or understood, from lower dimensional space. From those higher worlds one could access any time or place in our world.<br /><br />This not only confirms the existence of other intelligent civilizations throughout our known universe, but more importantly the existence of multidimensional beings who can come and go from our realm as they please.<br /><br />Throughout the cultures of the world, there are countless accounts of advanced beings visiting Earth, transferring technology to ancient Earth civilizations, and possibly even interbreeding with early humans. Even the very basis of Christianity begins with the idea that an omnipresent multidimensional being (God) can intervene at will, and can therefore transcend time and space.<br /><br />Alternative researchers like David Icke also talk about multidimensional beings visiting Earth and infecting the planet with great evil. According to Icke, the globalist controllers of our planet are literally reptilian shape-shifters who have invaded our world for the purpose of controlling and enslaving humanity. Although nothing like this is covered in Dr. Alexander's book, it is not inconsistent with what Dr. Alexander was told by God during his coma... Namely, that there are multidimensional realities, that certain high-vibration beings can traverse those realities at will, and that Earth is infested with a great evil with the specific purpose of testing our character.<br /><br />If all this sounds a little too spooky for you, consider the words of the Bible itself: An upright talking reptilian snake spoke in audible words to Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden, did it not?<br /><br />The science skeptics are wrong (again)<br />Regardless of what you might think about multidimensional beings, intelligent life beyond Earth, and the existence of great evil on our planet, there's one aspect of all this that's crystal clear: The science skeptics are dead wrong.<br /><br />Science \\"skeptics\\" are actually misnamed. They aren't skeptical at all. They simply follow their own religion with its own sacred beliefs that cannot be questioned... ever! Those beliefs include the utter worship of the materialistic view of the universe. Simultaneously, so-called \\"skeptics\\" do not believe they are conscious beings themselves because they believe consciousness is merely an \\"artifact\\" of biochemical brain function.<br /><br />There is no afterlife, they insist. There is no mind-body medicine, the placebo effect is useless, and there's no such thing as premonition, remote viewing or psychic phenomena. Oh yes, and they also insist that injecting yourself with mercury, MSG and formaldehyde via vaccines is actually good for you, that fluoride chemicals are good for the public health and that we should all eat more GMOs, pesticides and synthetic chemicals.<br /><br />It's no surprise these religious cult members of the \\"scientism\\" cult don't believe in an afterlife. That's what allows them to commit genocidal crimes against the human race today via GMOs, experimental medicine, toxic vaccines and other deadly pursuits. In their view, humans have no souls so killing them is of no consequence.<br /><br />As Dr. Alexander says,<br /><br />Certain members of the scientific community, who are pledged to the materialistic worldview, have insisted again and again that science and spirituality cannot coexist. They are mistaken.<br /><br />Well of course they are. The \\"science skeptics\\" are dead wrong about almost everything they claim to advocate. But their biggest mistake of all is in denying the existence of their own souls. Needless to say, they are all going to fail the human experience simulation once they pass on and face judgment. My, what a surprise that will be for those sad souls when they day arrives...<br /><br />I would hateto face God one day after having lived a life of a science skeptic, and then have God ask the question: \\"You doubted ME?\\" How could anyone take a look at the world around them and not see the signs of an intelligent Creator? Even the very laws of physics have been tweaked and fine-tuned in precisely the right balance so that our universe itself can support the formation of stars, and planets, and carbon-based life forms. This is called the \\"Goldilocks Enigma,\\" and there's a wonderful book by that same name written by Paul Davies.<br /><br />No biochemical explanation for Dr. Alexander's experience<br />For those skeptics who may be reading this, Dr. Alexander goes through nine possible biochemical hypotheses for his experiences and then meticulously and scientifically dismisses them all one by one. The result? His experience was REAL. In fact, it was \\"more real\\" than life as a human being.<br /><br />Remember, Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon. This guy knows the physical brain like no one else. The nine medical explanations he considers and dismisses as possible causes for his experience are:<br /><br />1) Primitive brainstem program.<br />2) Distorted recall of memories from the limbic system.<br />3) Endogenous glutamate blockade with excitotoxicity.<br />4) DMT dump.<br />5) Isolated preservation of cortical regions of the brain.<br />6) Loss of inhibitory neurons leading to highly levels of activity among excitatory neuronal networks to generate an apparent \\"ultra-reality.\\"<br />7) Activation of thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstorm to create a hyper-reality experience.<br />8) Reboot phenomenon.<br />9) Unusual memory generation through archaic visual pathways.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander may be the most credible afterlife witness in the history of humanity<br />Dr. Alexander's experience (and subsequent book) is arguably the best-documented case of the afterlife that exists in western science today. The fact that a vivid, hyper-real afterlife was experienced bya science skeptic materialistic brain surgeon who didn't believe in the afterlife -- and who subsequently found the courage to document his experiences and publish them in a book -- adds irrefutable credibility to the experience.<br /><br />This was not some kook seeking fame on a TV show. In fact, his writing this book earned him endless ridicule from his former \\"scientific\\" colleagues. There was every reason to NOT write this book. Only by the grace of God was Dr. Alexander healed of his e.coli infection, restored to normal brain function, and granted the VISION of the afterlife so that he could return to this realm and attempt to put it into words.<br /><br />Personally, I believe Dr. Alexander, and his experience mirrors that of countless others, across every culture, who have reported similar NDEs (Near Death Experiences). There is life after life, and the shift in consciousness of Earthlings that is required to take our species to a higher level of understanding begins, I believe, with embracing the truth of the immortality of our own souls (and the existence of a grand Creator).<br /><br />What does it all mean?<br />Dr. Alexander's spiritual journey gives us a wealth of information that can help provide meaning and purpose in our daily lives.<br /><br />For starters, it means that all our actions are recorded in the cosmos and that there are no secrets in the larger scope of things. You cannot secretly screw somebody over here on Earth and think it won't be recorded on your soul forever. It also means that all our actions will be accounted for in the afterlife. If this message sounds familiar, that's because an identical idea is the pillar of every major world religion, including Christianity.<br /><br />It also means there are people living today on this planet whose souls will literally burn in eternal Hell. There are others whose souls, like Dr. Alexander, will be lifted into Heaven and shown a greater reality. What we choose to do with our lives each andevery day determines which path our souls will take after the passing of our physical bodies.<br /><br />What matters, then, is not whether you actually succeed in defeating evil here on Earth, but rather the nature of your character that emerges from all the challenges and tribulations you face. This is all a test, get it? That's why life seems to suck sometimes. It's not a panacea; it's a testing ground for the most courageous souls of all -- those who wish to enter the realm of great evil and hope they can rise above it before the end of their human lifespan.\\" - Mike Adams<br /><br />See all of my reviews.

B004LWZW24|4.0|Maybe not as good as The Conjuring, but this movie offered a good amount of weirdness and scariness to keep your attention throughout. For the chicken hearted who don't like scary movies, they will not have bad dreams after this one. Probably.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story of a sheltered girl who finally meets a boy that makes her feel alive morphs from a beautiful romance to a heartbreaking story of overcoming shocking revelations about her past, acceptance, healing, and forgiveness.  Sky is funny and sarcastic and witty.  Holder is mysterious and intense and sweet.  Each have their own histories and issues they need to surmount, but together they find hope and the strength to overcome. This book ran the gamut of emotions; there was the thrill of new love and \\"the best first kiss in the history of first kisses--without even kissing,\\" the betrayal of finding out that the person you love has secrets, secrets that could shatter you, and the anguish of finding just what the secrets mean and the memories that accompany them, all with just the right moments of levity and whimsy.  Beautifully written, the emotions are so vivid, the characters so endearing, and the timeline so suspenseful it was a real challenge to put this book down. I loved everything about this book it is truly one of my all time favorites.

B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|I got introduced to Gregory Porter from a Tweet that Prince sent.  He sent a link to \\"Real Good Hands\\" from Gregory Porter's Be Good EP.  After seeing the video, I had to hear more of this man's beautiful voice.  I was not disappointed.  I ordered Be Good from iTunes.  On Tuesday, I ordered Liquid Spirit.  I have listened to this EP at least 10 times and I am listening to it now.  His voice takes me to another place.  I want to cry listening to this man's voice.  His voice is definitely a gift from God.  There is nothing but Gregory Porter's beautiful voice, piano, saxophone, bass, and trumpet, and drums.  That's it--real music.  Run, don't walk, and order all of his music you can get your hands on.  You will not be disappointed.

It only opens on three sides, but that's perfect so you don't drop your Kindle.  At least for me anyway.  It's sturdy inside with good protection for the new Kindle Fire HDX 7\\".  Can't wait to get the Kindle and put it in the case and try it out.  It has no smell at all to it either.

1781162646|3.0|I love it that this book was only available in hard copy (for a while anyway). I love the old fashioned pulp fiction cover and the idea of it, but like a lot of recent King books it's slow, slow, slow. I used to enjoy the build up in King books but now I think he's gone a little too far and the finales aren't worth the wait.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Six stories seemingly unrelated are presented in this excellent film about humanity.  It's a long film that never seems that way to me although I enjoy long form novels, movies, etc., as it allows you to delve into character.  Beautifully shot, well performed, great effects, and humanistic.  The story follows one soul as it traverses through time and gender changing its essence along the way. My friends and I were all captured by the story lines; how they intersect; and how they each resolve. My only negative comment about this film is the difficulty in understanding Tom Hanks in one story line in particular.  The dialect is difficult, but your ear does accustom itself and you will pick it up.  This is a gem that, unfortunately, deserved greater box office than it got.  That being said, I understand it is very popular on disc and, for that, I'm glad.  You should see this film.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does everything as advertised. Tried it out during the day to make sure it worked. It worked so well my work mate got it.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Phenomenal book that will really give you insight on what it could be like living in WWII Germany as a normal german citizen.  Don't read this if you like happy endings.  Don't read this if you don't want to cry.  If you want to learn and grow with a young lady and her family and friends in their struggles through living in nazi germany, this is a book for you.

B003H4I4JU|2.0|A big disappointment after reading Ender's Game. A shame, I was looking forward to a good sequel. In the first book the author focuses heavily on Ender.  In this sequel, it is less about Ender and more about other characters which I found largely uninteresting.
B003102JDM|4.0|I am a big fan of the Coen brothers' movies; this is not the best one but a really good movie. If you like their kind of sense of humor, you'll have a nice time watching it.

1594484805|3.0|Daniel Pink has written a good book from the perspective of what motivated us as we were growing up, isn't working anymore.  It is not working for us, and it is definately not working for the next generation.  In DRIVE, he contrasts &#34;Carrots and Sticks&#34; (old school) with &#34;Intrinsic motivation&#34;.  Intrinsic motivation is doing something for the sheer joy of doing it, or because we are tied into the overarching goals of what is stands for.  Compare that to working harder for the goal of more money, more power, more prestige.<br /><br />Daniel ties into something that Seth Godin is also talking about recently with the idea that we are moving from the Industrial Generation, to an more Connected Generation.  Since the goals and guidelines are changing, they way that people are motivated has to change as well.  One of the surprising out-takes is that the research this is based upon is not new, this is not a NEW phenomenon.  The genesis of the idea was first published in the 1940's and the resurfaced again in the mid 1990's.<br /><br />It is in interesting read.

B0049U4NQO|5.0|The last and most devastating book of the series. Mr. Horowitz did a magnificent job writing this action packed book series. To be honest i was kind of sad at the final chapter of Scorpia Rising, because i knew that once i finished it there will be no more Alex Rider. I highly recommend the Alex Rider series to anyone of the age 10+.

B000002GYI|4.0|Kraftwerk are really pioneers in the field of electronic music. Their music has stood the test of time. However, I think that Computer World is not Kraftwerk's greatest album. Still, it is a very good album.<br /><br />All the songs in Computer World revolves around computers in one way or another. The lyrics on some of the songs, e.g. Pocket Calculator makes me chuckle. However, lyrics isn't Kraftwerk's strong suit, in my opinion. I love Kraftwerk for the music and harmonies, not for the lyrics.<br /><br />If you're new to Kraftwerk, I'd suggest you buy another of their albums before coming back for this. I do however recommend this album. It's really good music.
0321934946|1.0|Typical book by the author. Too much wasted words. Too much non informational talk  lated to the subject. Goes off the subject many times. Poor format, poorly written, not a good book to learn from unless you are a salesman. Ther is more non informational material in this book than informational. Too much reading between the bull talk to get very little information.
B00CQZ65SI|4.0|The book was a good read about Djokovic's life. It is making me think about going Gluten-Free. Only think I that would make the book better is help me get started. Where to buy stuff? What to look for? Sample plans.

1455870137|4.0|I'm not really a huge fan of YA but my daughter keeps pushing John Green on me so I figured I better start reading his work or she's going to stop speaking to me. I did (mostly) enjoy The Fault in Our Stars last month so decided to grab Paper Towns when I found it unabridged at my library. This book is not a retread of that grueling material (thankfully) but more of a follow the really vague clues type of mystery. I'll state up front that I'm not good at clues or puzzles so I had trouble figuring out how they got from point A to point B. I know, that's completely my issue.<br /><br />Quentin and Margo have lived across from each other since they were little kids. They grew up as friends and drifted apart somewhere in middle school as kids do. Now they're high school seniors. Margo is beautiful, adventurous and hangs with the popular crowd. Quentin is just an average boy. He has friends and is liked well enough but he's not exactly Margo material. So when she comes knocking on his bedroom window late one night dressed up like a ninja and basically demanding that he drive her around to exact some revenge on her current group of friends, well, how can he possibly resist? Margo needs him and he secretly lusts/loves/longs for her though he'll never admit it out loud. After this night is over, he hopes she'll acknowledge his existence in school and his senior year will be unforgettable. They have an action packed night, she wreaks her vengeance and Quentin finds himself going along with all of her crazy ideas because his heart hasn't pumped like this in probably forever.<br /><br />I adored the opening series of events that starts this book. Quentin and Margo have a good dynamic going and their thoughts and dialogue came across as real (which is the only problem I had with Green's beloved \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\") and it was relatively and refreshingly pretty much angst free.<br /><br />After their adventure filled night Quentin looks forward to a closer friendship with Margo but soon realizes it is not going to happen. Margo is long gone and has left behind a few very vague clues for Quentin to piece together which is how he spends most of the rest of the book. Looking for Margo, thinking about Margo and enlisting a few of his friends (one who I found super annoying) in the search for Margo. Le sigh. Most of the magic was gone then, along with Margo and it was here that the book lost most of my interest too.<br /><br />Still I soldiered on and I finished. Oh the things I do for my kid.<br /><br />I'm giving this one a 3 and ½ mostly for its fantastic start and some fun dialogue. Though the ending felt real and I can appreciate that, I'd be lying if I didn't admit that it left me a bit unsatisfied after all of the pages leading up to it . . . and that's all I'm saying about that.<br /><br />Narration Notes: Dan John Miller does very well with Quentin's dialogue as well as Margo's. But why, oh god why, does he have to scream out every line Q's best friend utters with super over done enthusiasm? Why, why, why? I swear \\"honey bunnies\\" the next town over could probably hear his voice leaking out of my headphones. I cringed whenever that too excitable kid popped up on the scene because I knew my ears were about to hate me. He does however have one of my favorite lines from the book:<br /><br />\\"Dude, I don't want to talk about Lacey's prom shoes. And I'll tell you why: I have this thing that makes me really uninterested in prom shoes. It's called a penis.\\"argo but soon realizes it is not going to happen.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|Although I thought it was a good movie, I just think the storyline could have been much better, I wasn't really impressed with the graphics or the actor performances.  There were a couple really great scenes, but that was pretty much all this movie did for me.
B00BEIYP8A|5.0|In many ways Rush was nothing like what I expected.  When I think of driving/racing movies I think of The Transporter (2002), Fast Five (2011), Driven (2001) or Drive (2011).  While these movies vary wildly in quality (some action movies, a competitive bro flick and a one legit film), they all have VERY exciting driving scenes.  These movies also feature some aging bro-mentor meets wildcard rookie moments (Driven), intense stoic Albert Brooks and head stomping scenes (Driven), some serious jump spin kicks bringing Hong Kong cinema to America (The Transporter) and an international pec dance-off between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel (Fast Five).  Sure, there are some heavy moments surrounding the driving scenes in all these movies.  But, far to the contrary, Rush's driving scenes were the least exciting scenes of the entire film...and in no way is this to the film's detriment.<br /><br />Rush chronicles the ascension of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth, deflated from his Thor role) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) from their humble Formula 3 beginnings up to the contentious glory of Formula One.  Their actions and dialogue, whether to, about or because of one another, illustrate their dependence on each other which subsequently fuels their  addiction to competition.  Each minute of this movie is every bit a duel as Rocky versus Ivan Drago and they bring out the very best (and the very worst) in each other.<br /><br />But this \\"race car\\" movie hardly focuses on \\"action\\" or \\"racing\\" at all.  But it is every bit about the intensity \\"of\\" the race...and the rush experienced by its competitors.  This film is about the relationship and rivalry between of Hunt and Lauda, not the engines behind which they sit.  As such, while almost every scene is effective and elicits sneers, gasps, laughs or sympathy--none of the major action or excitement takes place while the cars are actually moving.  Quite to the contrary, the drivers rev their engines and scream around the track as Hans Zimmer's soulful score builds to something powerful.  However, the crescendo is not found in gasp-worthy maneuvers or photo finishes.  It's what happens when the cars \\"aren't\\" racing that is exciting.  The drama and humor finds us \\"before\\" setting foot in the car.  Frustrations and conflict are expressed when the cars pit.  And your greatest shock occurs not in anticipation of a crash, nor at the devastating contact of it.  No...  The heaviest moments in this film occur during the 90 seconds \\"after\\" the collision that leads to the crash and \\"after\\" the car has come to a complete stop!  Yet more intensity is found as Lauda perseveres and recovers from irrecoverable injuries driven to resume his race against Hunt for the 1976 championship.  You may not find it with the wind blowing through your hair on a sun-soaked day, but you will feel the rush and see the magnitude of the races through a different lens altogether.<br /><br />But still, the cinematography does its part, seizing the drivers' hesitation with stunning rainy competition shots, speeding fish-eye lens framing and grounded POV angles.<br /><br />Playing the three-time champ Lauda, Daniel Br&uuml;hl masters his role as the rigid, obsessive, friendless and charmless Austrian.  His tactful brilliance oozed a preternaturally meticulous fluency of all things racing--from track to engine and from the car to the man.  Lauda's complete opposite, Chris Hemsworth champions the devilishly charming Brit, James Hunt.  Whereas Lauda remains determined, never letting his victories blur his focus, Hunt basks in international success, sexual conquest and alcoholic bliss.  It's a wonder his cause of death wasn't being crushed to death under a pile of beautiful women.  The press and the ladies alike adore this dashing silver-tongued hero.<br /><br />A cameo by Natalie Dormer (Game of Thrones) swiftly ignites the screen with Hunt's sexuality.  But as the film shifts from ascension to harsh conflict, Olivia Wilde assume the roleof supermodel Suzy Miller.  As Hunt's wife, however briefly and tragic their marriage, she serves as little more than an emotionless frame depicting from within the image of Hunt's downward spiral.  Serving quite a different purpose as Marlene Lauda, Alexandra Maria Lara breathes life into Niki Lauda, humanizing his otherwise coarse persona and bringing him to the realization that greater happiness can be found off the track than forever chasing the next technical victory on the horizon.  Without her, he'd never truly understand the \\"sacrifices\\" he so vehemently preaches to Hunt--or when they mount to high.<br /><br />This is a film that will make you \\"feel.\\"  You'll traverse most emotions of the human spectrum.  But most importantly, the start and the finish will find you feeling elated.rmodel Suzy Miller.

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|It was a little difficult to follow at first, but when it all comes together (and it will come together for people at different times throughout the movie) it is really fabulous.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Great ending, not what I was expecting. Hated the little boy passages - not the words - the story. Horrified to know they were based on true fact. Definitely recommend.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It had some great moments but in the I just felt it could have been much better and the ending was a bit poopish,
B008B8AOQI|5.0|It's wonderful. I really love the stories and music. This band is a gem. Hopefully will see them in my area.
B003QSIM30|4.0|Some of the content, as with a lot of Disney movies, was a little too adultish in my opinion, I think Disney should re-evaluate their perception of what a childhood audience is all about.
0718178130|5.0|Don Tillman manages himself. He doesn't fit in, in any conventional sense nor in any ordinary way. He lives by route, eats by standardized meal selection and finds the concept of fun totally alien. Nevertheless, he sees the need to initiate a search for a life mate. However, normal dating routines leave him cold; he hates the waste of time--he simply does not have the social skills to patiently wait out traditional matchmaking trial and error. So, like the scientist he is, he decides to tackle the problem logically. He draws up a questionnaire to eliminate any potential time wastes in his quest to find a suitable wife--really!<br />To fob this off as a, feel good frolic, is to severely undermine both the truly magical story as well as the gut-wrenching hilarity of the novel; I laughed so hard, and so long that my eyes watered, literally. Don meets Rosie a wholly unsuitable candidate on his marriage rating scale--she smokes, hates red meat and drinks copiously. Despite everything Don finds Rosie unbearably attractive. As a geneticist, Don, decides to assist Rosie in conducting a series of surreptitious DNA tests on possible paternity candidates, whom Rosie's mother, long deceased, led her daughter to believe might be her rightful father. In the ensuing antics, Don and Rosie grow sideways and longways both in the mind of the reader and in the plot of the story, to become the most charming fictional couple since 'Harry met Sally', including inappropriate, tear-drenchingly funny behavior. The Rosie Project, is simply one of those books you know by instinct will remain on your 'to recommend list' for years to come. A wholly entertaining read, that pokes trills of unpredictable thrills to pop goosebumps of pleasure over your skin with almost every smile-a-minute word.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|This is one of the best Disney/Pixar movies of ALL TIME.  I really miss the old school animated Disney movies, but when they come out with masterpieces like this, it's all good ;-)
B001HN6922|5.0|good condition; would consider using this particular individual again.  It came in a timely manner to our home and we & kids love the Cars movies.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|It is by far my most FAVORITE of ALL the Men In Blacks.  I think they did an excellent job with all 3 movies, but Josh Brolin played Agent K PERFECTLY!!  This one will make you laugh and even cry, yep, I cried...
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|A great read.  I am now on  the sixth booki.  That should tell you all you need to know.  The best writer of  bloody battle scenes involving the living, the undead,  and the deamon beasts of nightmares.  Enjoy.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|This movie made me laugh so hard I nearly choked on my tots...seriously though it is one of the best movies ever ;)
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Just got back from Disneyland/CA Adventure and surprised they haven't added any merchandise or themed activity around this movie yet.  Fun characters and music for the whole family to enjoy!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I thought this was really great, it is one of my favorites.  Very imaginative and it was great seeing some of those retro characters from my early childhood come to life again.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|An amazing sci-fi movie that I'm glad I didn't pass up like most mainstream audiences. And at such a cheap price for Blu-Ray
1250030951|5.0|This book is such a refreshing read!  Different from all of the other girl goes to college, parties, finds dream guy(s), and lands perfect job.  Highly recommended, especially if you liked Rowell's other books.<br /><br />I love Rowell's diversity between all 3 of her books.  Can't wait for #4!
0061801313|5.0|These books came in great condition and arrived earlier than I expected the shipping date to be. The pages are crisp and the writing is easy to read. The box that the books came in isn't damaged in the corners or scratched in any way.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. It is a unique concept for a game.  A great puzzle and fun levels.
B0002XDODU|3.0|Love the CD i know all of the songs. The case was cracked when I got it though. That was pretty disappointing and the only reason i am writing this review. The CD was fine but the case is just as important. If i wanted a cracked case I would have just bough it from a drug dealer on the street corner and paid for it my selling my body. (That escalated quickly)
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Great story with lots of good action.  Even without Matt Damon, the movie was very enjoyable.  Jeremy Renner is a superb actor.
B007MDB71O|5.0|i thought the movie was great never read the book thats next but a fun movie glad i bought it.
B00574PQDU|4.0|What can I say?  Friends recommended this movie.  My daughter and I watched it and we both liked it.  It was bit sci-fi which pleased my daughter.
B00991TCOG|5.0|great cd wish it had the elder scrolls songs and ect on it but great cd my son even likes it a lot
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does the job!  I'm glad I downloaded this app.  Now I don't have to dig for a calculator when I need one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It was entertaining and exciting! Bain was at the top of his game, and cat women was apparently even Steven's sister???!!!
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game. I was addicted to Hey Day by apple and then no longer had an iphone. Those who are looking for a similar game,  this is it. Its fun and addictive and I cant get enough. add me on my id FAQAFRX.
B000TYWAUA|5.0|This movie has some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in my entire life. The plot is incredible.
B001HN6922|5.0|The perfect ending for the birthday party of a my three year old grandson.  He was treated to a special time with his parents.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Movie came quickly and in very good condition.  Haven't had a chance to watch yet as we left town just after it came.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|It is just the thing you need when going someplace. You know your Kindle is safe. It is very easy to take with you and easy to manage. Can't do without it.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|The major characters are certainly not stereotype. They are full, fascinating, and multidimensional. The heroes have their dark side and the villains have their good side. A great read. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|I am glad I only wasted .99 on this book, though I wish I hadn't spent any money at all.  This book sounded interesting based on the description and I figured it would be a good read based on the 4.5 stars it had. Boy was I wrong. The writing style of this book is something I would expect from a middle school child. There are so many typos and editing errors. Not to mention that the characters are flat and just plain unbelievable. Who in their right mind would spill their deep dark secrets within hours of meeting someone, or fall in love talking after to your witness for 20 minutes???! Also, you could see the ending coming almost at the beginning of the book. I feel like the author gave away too many details too soon in the book so there was no real suspense at all. The idea behind the story had so much potential, but never managed to make it work.
B0016OMFNY|4.0|I have always enjoyed this CD.  Lost the first one and was happy to find it again.<br />Music is good.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I had never heard of this game but downloaded it after reading the description.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is easy to learn. The games gradually become more challenging.  If you like logic puzzles, you won`t be disappointed.
B004G6009U|5.0|Its Disney's Tangled. Fun take on Rapunzel. Great Graphics, fun story. if you havent seen it you are missing out. Fun for adults and the kids too!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Good book. It explains things but not a lot that I didn't already guess from the rest of the series. This one want written as well as the others. Definitely still worth a read, but I was kind disappointed...
1601254679|5.0|Another great Paizo product and a must have tool for DM's! And true to Paizo's high standard of artwork, the art in this book is fantastic.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I decided to watch Sons when Charlie Hunnam was cast as Christian Grey out of curiosity.  Now I am hooked.  This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  The acting, the writing, the production quality have few equals.  I decided to download the entire series.  I've been riveted ever since.  I highly recommend this.you will not be disappointed.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you played MTG in the past and havent played it in a while, get this app. Its worth every penny of the 9.99 I paid for it. Good GUI, and fun graphics based on MTG Art. if you are playing MTG with real cards now, you should still get this app, and hone your MTG skills. 3 modes, for beginners to archmagi.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I Love it, I Love it, I Love it! Love the top notch acting.  Love the picturesque country and homes.  Love the accurate costumes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A book that challenges you to truly ponder the big decisions.  What would you do?  Couldn't put this book down.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|A most entertaining show!  Great acting by cast, great shoots, well written.  Damien Lewis has always been a favorite actor for us, he never fails to deliver a very believable portrayal of any character he plays.  Claire Danes, although not one of my favorite actresses, is<br />nevertheless, very intense in this role.<br /><br />Thumbs up!
B00E9P959O|5.0|I was a fan of the album upon release, but like many others the poor production quality greatly limited my overall enjoyment of the recording.  Bottrill's treatment of the album, essentially given free license to remix as he wanted, is a breath of fresh air.  Clarity in sonic quality along with some interesting vocal and guitar choices (he often uses different takes than what appeared on the original release).  This is win/win for any Rush fan, and will likely refresh interest in the casual rock music listener.
B00594XOZU|1.0|The application was awesome, but when the update came out for the application it wouldn't let me create an account or sign in. Please fix this soon.
B004R65AFS|5.0|I am begining to prefer Penquin Classics editions over others. They have a sound introduction/light criticism in the begining and wonderful historical notes at the end.
0811879542|5.0|we love this!  we are sort of anti-tablets for our two year old and this book shows drawing, reading and playing can be just as fun if you do it right!
B005OK721G|5.0|Colombiana has replaced my favorite movie.<br />This one is now my number one.<br />Enjoy movies where the female is the 'Powerful One!'<br />Highly recommended for the action and the story.
0061906220|5.0|my daughter loves shoes and singing...so of course she loved this book!  there's youtubes of the writer doing the song but we tend to make it up each time.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|unpredictable - just like a good movie should be.<br />Would recommend to the all the 'Law' watchers.<br />Glad that I added it to my collection.
B008Y212PI|4.0|just started playing this game but having a good time. fun and relaxing to play. I am  anxious to keep going
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Love this show one of the best ever made, the complete set makes it even nicer .. thanks .. LV
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Can't Waite to start Winter of the World to see where tis story goes. Ken seems to always keep my attention.
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|Once again a great book by Scott Kelby. Lightroom with a twist of hunour, or twisted humour... All good to me
B004JMY312|5.0|I absolutely love watching this every Halloween season. I reminds me of the times I used to watch it as a kid. I think kids today will still enjoy it, especially with all the jokes surrounding the witches' approaches to technology, and &#34;yabos&#34;, lol.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just received it from Amazon so haven't read it yet - and can't wait.  I LOVE Stephen King - so what could be bad!!  He is the master of scary!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible apps is easy to navigate through, place the word at your finger tips for whenver you need it. No excuses now!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|***spoilers possible***<br />I listened to the audio production of this book. It's a decent story. Way, way far-fetched, but enjoyable. Robie's a likable character. Julie Getty and Agent Nicole Vance (Nikki) are also interesting. The big reveal of the bad guy could be seen from miles away but it's still a satisfying twist.<br /><br />The plot itself sort of meanders all over the place, but with the main narrator and a voice actress bringing the characters to life, it didn't seem like forever. I'm pretty sure if I'd read the actual book I might be singing a different tune here on the plot score.<br /><br />I think I like some of David Baldacci's other works better, but I'd definitely pick up more books about Robie. The author manages to make me care about the characters even in and around the ridiculous plot.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|So i liked it b/c even though I'm not a hug &#34;zombie movie&#34; fan (my husband LOVED it) you can't help but be pulled into the story with the great acting. It also helped that the story line, though pretty much the same old zombie story, is sprinkled with subtle clues throughout that helps put the puzzle together at the end.
B00ELD19OI|5.0|Melodic prog metal, the way it should be, dynamic, tight, and creative.  Every album just gets better.  Mountain tops first two albums.
0120884674|5.0|I love this book. It works amazingly for my osteology class and probably will be helpful in the future too.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Did the creative brain and intellect that brought us Harry Potter really write this book? What a disappointment! Not a book for lovers of Harry.
B000002J1L|5.0|I think this item like a piece of art..Gteat album!!!! I like so much this album....one of the great  albums from the original band.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|these movies rock. it reminds me of my younger days and watch giant worms eating people and i love it.
0738212415|5.0|Great beginning drawing book. My 9 year old son has taken this book over and has been drawing from it almost daily. The step-by-step directions are very helpful and the tip and explanations make it easy for anyone to understand the techniques.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait for season 4 to find out what happens! Cliffhanger endings are killers! Will definitely keep watching no matter how many more seasons there are.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|really good book, i loved reading it. i stopped nere the end of the book because i was scared of how it would end, once i got over it and finished the book it did not disapoint me. i would advice people to read it. its really good.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|This album is simply wonderful. I listen to Smooth Jazz from Tampa Bay Florida on the internet and they played this album.  The first time hearing Mr Porter's voice I fell in love with him.  The songs take me back to my youthful days growing up in NYC. The jazz is perfection. Anyone who buys this album will not regret it. I highly recommend it!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|It was not very believable but other than that the story was fantastic, absorbing and very original. The reason I say not believable is because I think that dreams are not that chronological but more random and unreal. I really enjoyed the movie.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|George is a close friend that I have never met. This is a beautiful tribute to him and his music.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|My bookclub recently read this book and we all enjoyed it. If you love flowers you'll love this book and all it's meanings.
B0032FPVKE|3.0|This was the bag recommended for my Pentax X-5, and it does work, but just barely. Really a tight fit.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|i really love this game. its really fun getting the new fish planting new coral. like having a fish tank with none of the clean up. :)
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|As the title mentions, I've never played Halo, so I'm not as in tune with the Halo universe as some of the reviewers are.  That said, I watched it because it seemed like an interesting video, and I was not disappointed.  The view of Academy life, as run through the (not always realistic) lens of sci-fi made it interesting, as was the part about the talented but unsure recruit forced to find himself in the middle of a war.  Truthfully, it could have stood just as well on its own without the Halo elements, and would have been a good film for it.  Halo fan or not, it's worth a view.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought this set for my husband as a gift, and he loved the series when it was one.  The case is like a portfolio, and each season has its own DVDs in internal &#34;manila&#34; folders.  Very cute assembly, and it's a great show.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Challenging enough to keep one busy for a couple of hours, but not so difficult that it frustrates. I hope there will be a sequel soon!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|great music wild outfits but looked better with dreadlocks i guess we all change when we get older thanx lenny
B00486070K|5.0|Works Great!!  I am totally happy with the device, works as specified with Mac OS and Windows 8 on MacBook Air.
B000002GJH|5.0|bought it for my 16 year old daughter she loves it to bad they could not have made more music
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Works Great, but not with windows.  Using on MacBook Air with Mac OS and Windows 8 with Bootcamp.<br /><br />This device needs add-on to work with Windows, that messes up the sleep mode.  I need that option, so until someone comes up with a work-a-round, I am not using it in Windows.
B000002LSV|5.0|the original beards still know how to rock great party music keg of beer bonfire etc love em bought this one for my 16 year old daughter she loves em
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Ok, probably NOT by favorite season, but I love, love, love this show. While there were a few 'cheesy' moments this season, I'd definitely recommend
B000002LQR|5.0|my 16 year old daughters favorite group it was a must have for her she loves it may she keep on rockin
B007PJFFWC|5.0|Good family movie, different perspective as Burton does, but really good. Also, Pearl Jam wrote a song about this movie, can't go wrong with that.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|bought for my 16 year old daughter what does that say music that will last hopefully for many more generations
1595141715|5.0|It's a good read...makes you think and re-evaluate things.<br />Highly recommended, especially for maybe a younger audience.<br />Nowadays, with all the bullying, maybe this book should be read in schools.
B005BX3NAA|5.0|bought it for my daughter at age 16 she likes alot of music but she leans towards what her daddy likes
014241543X|5.0|Once I started reading, I really couldn't put it down.<br />Really great read. I would recommend this to anyone.<br />I very more enjoyed it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|a purchase for my daughter  she loves them for her ever growing music collection rhcp have been up anddown a good purchase
0307276902|5.0|Fiction or not...I don't know why this book got such hard criticism when it first came out.<br />It's a great read, and I have always enjoyed this book, and always will.<br />I've read it a few times now, and I love it.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|bought for my 16 year daughter their music appeals to many age groups may they keep on rockin enter sandman at yankee stadium was excellent
0525476881|5.0|Started off a bit slow for me, but quickly picked up and before I knew it I couldn't put it down.<br />John Green is a great writer, 'The Fault In Our Stars,' still my favorite of his.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|texas should be proud lots of musical talent  there i listened to them since my teen years now in my 50s now my daughter wants her own
B00CIVLZ3U|2.0|I really enjoy Sanderson's work but unfortunately this one was definitely a step down for him. The book had a \\"debut novel\\" feel about it or maybe it was just more juvenile relative to his other books. Perhaps he was intentionally targeting a younger audience. The characters also weren't as well developed and the relationships felt very shallow as a result thereof.<br /><br />Really looking forward to Words of Radiance but this book has made me check my expectations somewhat.
B0043URV5U|5.0|how can you not build a music collection for your 16 year old daughter without bob seger amust have she has daddys taste
B00915G6MG|5.0|Because I am an avid NCIS fan and the extra features are interesting and offer insight into the program.  I have purchased most of the NCIS seasons and have not been disappointed in any of them.
B000056VJ7|5.0|once you hear it its in your head forever bought it for my 16 year old daughter its fun music
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Delightful,  entertaining and cleverly written for kids as well as adults. The manner in which the kids solved the problems and came up with ways to make  their points was great.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I thought this book would be a sequel or prequel to Racing in the Rain which, as a dog lover, I thought was well done. When I read the first page of Art of . . . , I realized that I had already read these words and checked Racing in the . . . and sure enough Art of. . . was the exact same page. Curious I continued to read and yep it was the same story --- with some changes here and there.<br /><br />Frankly, I find this version a little preachy and wonder why Mr. Stein (and his publisher) published it. So if you have read Racing in the Rain (the one with the puppy on the cover) there really is no need to read Art of Racing in the Rain (the one with the adult dog on the cover).
B00915G6R6|5.0|excellent show, worth buying. best season so far. a thoroughly compelling, well written show that is worthy of emmy accolades
B00BEIYP1W|5.0|I walked in to the cinema knowing little about the plot of the film. All I knew was that it was based on true F1 events and directed by Ron Howard. Oh my God! what a knock out this movie turned out to be.<br /><br />Ron Howard is at the top of his game here. As a director, it would have been very easy to to get lost in the racing sequences but Howard being the master he is, knew he had a human story to tell. Excellent performances by the cast and another adrelanine pumping soundtrack by Hans Zimmer made this my best cinema experience of this year so far. This is sure to elate your spirits.<br /><br />One word of advice though, after watching the film, just be easy on the pedal while driving back home.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Every time I get this it ends up glitching and not working at all, therefore I have to 're install it every time in order for it to work properly.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Entertaining and fun.  Keeps me coming back.  Haven't quite figured out all the perks but the hints are helpful.  Lots of visuals to make it entertaining.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I had gone to my local video store and looked for season 2. I couldn't find it anywhere! I was so glad that Amazon had the item and I got my Dollhouse fix quickly!!!
B00000JXVK|4.0|This documentary on what enthusiasts were doing with their motorcycles nearly 50-years ago is as true to the mark today as it was when it was made. The technology of the machines has changed dramatically in that time, but not the myriad ways riders use them for weekend enjoyment, and you will find most of those diversions here in this film featuring Steve McQueen, Malcolm Smith, and AMA National Champion Mert Lawill.
0061689246|4.0|I haven't read all of Gaiman's books but I have read a good amount of them.  This is definitely the most unique of the works.  It reminded me somewhat of Neverwhere (which I absolutely loved) but more young adult friendly.  It is very fairy tale-ish which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all if you don't mind that sort of thing but may turn off some readers.  It is easy to read as are all Gaiman's books.  The characters are okay and the story is pretty good but overall it wasn't anything incredible for me.  I don't mean to say it is bad by any means, it just isn't on par with the author's other works that I have read.  It's a quick and easy read which tells a simplistic, folky tale with fairies, witches, dragons, unicorns, talking rabbits etc.... you know the sort.<br />Bottom line, if you like Gaiman and are in the mood for an upbeat mystical story you can read over the weekend, pick it up.  If you are looking for a more adult themed book, probably look elsewhere.
B00C5R8364|5.0|A little slow in the beginning but Frederick Forsyth never disappoints.  I've read everyone of his books and enjoyed all of them,
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It wrapped everything up well. Some parts pissed me off, but in the end it was a very good book.
B0095P31L6|5.0|a new kind of animation that is absorbing, sound was great and everything looked so real / i saw it about 5 times the animation was captivating.  we have come a long way since mickey mouse.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Amazingly put together,loved every minute of it can't wait for the new season to start<br />The characters did and outstanding performance!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|back to the future geek so I had to have this.  as with all legos, fit and quality is second to none.  impressive collectible.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|on every phone or tablet, especially when you want to quiet down the kids, they never seem to get tired of it.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have read it twice and I am talking it up when ever I get the chance.  I love it.  Written so this idea can be understood to people opening their minds up to it for the first time, just enough to try the exercises.<br /><br />My first exercise blew me away.  Have you ever received a government check three days early?  We did.  That was proof enough for me.
B002I8PVQA|5.0|Watched this the other day.  I figured out about fifteen minutes in that I've seen this before.  I liked it so much I just watched it again anyways.  Really smart flick.  Edward Norton is the man.
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|I guess I will start of saying I've never been a huge fan of Wayne but I had never really say down and listened to his music. I baught this album when it came out after all of the hype surrounding Wayne and his music over the years. I will say this is a classic album. Wayne has spits and know's how to properly put together a track. The album is classic. No filler tracks. No tracks that I skip. I liked it so much I am going to go back and check out a few of his other albums as well.
B006S086AM|4.0|This was pretty good as a comedy alone, but also had some storyline to it.  Good flick.  I would recommend it pretty highly.
B00BU987C8|5.0|I purchased this album after hearing hip rip the intro track to Game's Red album and hearing the single &#34;Swimming Pools&#34; Not what you expect from someone outta compton but definetly a classic album. A very good balace of different types of production and his flow. Unique concepts and just a dope album. Cop it!
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|just one big happy family! emma stone is so cute, ryan gosling....well, it's ryan gosling! so fine! there should be more romantic comedies with him as lead.
B00ECLU346|3.0|It certainly isn't the Hangover or Hangover Part2,but it is a good movie worth seeing.I certainly don't think it is as<br />funny as the original,but has it's moments.Mr Chow seems to overwhelm the movie,and then the movie shifts more<br />towards him.Worth seeing.....Frank
B007MU85D0|5.0|So...  I love the hell out this album.  They've put together a unique sound that could be &#34;in the vein&#34; of other bands like the male-female folkish harmonies of The Civil Wars or the folk-pop production of Lumineers or the..., BUT their sound is all their own and the &#34;in the vein&#34; comparisons don't matter.<br /><br />There's also the fact that I have no idea what any of the songs are about.<br /><br />&#34;Jumping up and down the floor,<br />My head is an animal.<br />And once there was an animal,<br />It had a son that mowed the lawn.<br />The son was an ok guy,<br />They had a pet dragonfly.<br />The dragonfly it ran away,<br />But it came back with a story to say&#34;<br /><br />REALLY?!  What the heck is that about?!<br /><br />BUT, being confused as all heck about the lyrics does nothing to detract from how much I love this album.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son has had trouble learning the alphabet.This is a fun way for him to learn. He does not even realize that he is learning, he just thinks he is playing a game. It has helped out tremendously and is a great app for anyone looking to help their kids learn the alphabet in an exiting and new way.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|MaddAddam was a good read that filled in more of the gaps.  I love Atwood's facility with non-linear storytelling; the plot moves into the future and into the past at the same time to complete a picture.  Most of the outstanding questions were answered, but the ending left me feeling a little... flat, like I wanted and needed more that I hadn't gotten.  Maybe I'll edit this review after re-reading the trilogy back to back without the months long pauses in between them.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is a real pleasure to listen to and enjoy.  Miss Boyle is a very gifted artist.  Well done!
B008Y212PI|4.0|This is a great game and a good way to pass time. I got it as the faotd so it was worth it.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Great attention to details and landscape In this book. Marvelous job all around, even if it was slightly long winded.
B008R14YBK|5.0|Again a great gift for a younger girl, some of the other stars are not appropriate but this is perfect
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have a lot of 35mm negatives and was looking for a good scanner. And this film scanner fills my needs perfectly, for this price it delivers good results.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|It was for my six year old daughter and she loves it.  It has been a holiday life saver this break
B008A36R2Y|5.0|I've worked with a lot of firmware devices and this one was by far the easiest the work with, their software is C++ based and it plugs right in to the USB port, and just works, well, I did have to download a windows 7 driver for it, but after that, plug it in and upload the code.  Even reading directly from the pins with time sensitive stuff was easy, I just set the pin to input and then scan the pin after a few microseconds until it changes states.  I'm going to order more of these for some other projects.
B0072GPQNG|3.0|It was just what Mom wanted.  She will enjoy every minute of this movie. Good gift and worth the price from Amazon.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app. There's not a day that goes by where I don't use it.<br /><br />EXCEPT:<br /><br />I reset my Kik by accident, and now it won't let me sign back in. It hasn't been working for about four days now, and I don't know what's going on. It's making me angry. I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, but nothing seems to be working.
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|Good fun entertaining movie. Just as enjoyable as the original.  The dance scenes showed some modern flare and the dialog was appropriate for the movie.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|All I can say is that this thing was a dud. Let alone the fact that there is little Big Daddy Cool in this film but the bottom line is that they left out all of the good bands from the 80's. This is nothing but a bunch of sissy music that pansy boys listened to in their moms cars.<br /><br />Now I've never been to the strip but I got a few buddies who've been and they say this is nothing like what it was like. I got a few solutions on how this movie coulda been better, but it starts and ends with more Kevin Nash. He should have at least given someone a big boot.<br /><br />Keep Trucking.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|5 stars, because I laughed and enjoyed this movie so much. The men in it just made it that much better. So funny, and just lovely.
B0095GSKDE|5.0|Excellent read . Especially if you like to know the&#34;why&#34; of things. Parents of small children might find pertinent info for them if they plan to put their kids into sports.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Adobe Reader app has made viewing downloads on the Kindle Fire a snap, and relieved much frustration. Highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever<br />And is awesome and fun<br />It is cool. And funny and did I mention awesome and I am 14
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great weather app - just wish it had local weather alerts, as well as more detail regarding wind. All in all, it does the job.
B0076I624W|2.0|It's a copy, not an original Blu-ray. Picture quality is not good. You get what you pay for. Don't buy.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Great case! Feel safe with it! Not so bulky like the big otter box. I will definitely buy another one if ever needed.
1603429999|2.0|I found better help on you tube.  She didn't even cover laddering.  Maybe for the very beginner.  But, you can always learn something, right???
B00005ASIL|5.0|Ian Anderson and Tull are one of a kind. Just a great album and a great band. You need this!!!
0802136834|2.0|Please do not buy this book for actual education purposes. Had I bought this copy I'd have thrown it against the wall. Tons of factual errors, most of which skew against the wives (and especially Anne Boleyn, who (to borrow a joke) becomes Darth Boleyn in this book), and poor endnoting practices. Not much understanding of Tudor sexual mores either - for example, Anne is said to have turned Henry out of bed due to disinterest during her pregnancy - but in reality, the Tudors thought sex during pregnancy was extremely dangerous for all involved (even the man!), and no man of understanding would be caught sleeping with a pregnant wife.<br /><br />And on and on...I had such high hopes for this.
B00006IX0R|5.0|Deloris is fantastic. One of the greatest female voices in Rock and Roll. Zombie - WTF how good is that?? A must buy.
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|When it first came out, I wanted to see it but it wasn't around very long.  I managed to catch it on a flight back from Paris. Great Story! Great Acting and a great twist at the end. That wasn't enough so I had to buy it, to fully appreciate it.
B006C45MRE|5.0|It was different, and I liked it very much! It portrayed loyalty, and bravery, and the courage to work with your enemies for a common cause.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Although in its product infancy, I appreciate and enjoy the capabilities of the product and am hopeful that Google will expand its capabilities.  While I've a DVD player that provides similar video connection via the internet, the full screen presentation of YouTube video clips of great music and performances was well worth the small investment.  It has already generated a lot of interest and activity among enthusiastic &#34;rooter&#34; groups trying to expand its capabilities.
B005J4VV28|4.0|I liked these cartoons as a kid for the music.  The stories are silly, and the voices do not sound anything like the Beatles, but I enjoyed them anyway.  Mostly for the music,and the sing along on every episode.
0385743564|5.0|Book Info: Genre: Dystopian fantasy<br />Reading Level: YA<br />Recommended for: Fans of YA Dystopian fantasy, good storytelling<br />Trigger Warnings: murder, mass murder, killing, violence, fighting, slavery<br /><br />My Thoughts: Wow, this was a really good book, a very well-told story, fast-paced while also providing great character development and plenty of mysteries and twists to keep the reader engaged with the story. David is a really interesting character, and while not quite catching everything as fast as I did as I read it, he eventually figured everything out in the end.<br /><br />There are a lot of different ideas running through this book, including ideas about the nature of humanity, the corruption of power, and the desire of people to be rescued. It also addresses how easily people can adapt to almost any situation given time.<br /><br />I think anyone who enjoys YA fantasy, especially dystopian, will really enjoy this book. I know I'll be eagerly awaiting the next book in this series, scheduled for release next year. You should too.<br /><br />Series Information: Reckoners<br />Book 1: Steelheart<br />Book 2: Firefight, scheduled for release in 2014<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a paperback galley from Amazon Vine in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.<br /><br />Synopsis: \\"There are no heroes.<br /><br />\\"Every single person who manifested powers--we call them Epics--turned out to be evil.<br /><br />\\"Here, in the city once known as Chicago, an extraordinarily powerful Epic declared himself Emperor. Steelheart has the strength of ten men and can control the elements. It is said no bullet can harm him, no sword can split his skin, no explosion can burn him. He is invincible.<br /><br />\\"It has been ten years. We live our lives as best we can. Nobody fights back . . . nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans who spend their lives studying powerful Epics, finding their weaknesses, then assassinating them.<br /><br />\\"My name is David Charleston. I'm not one of the Reckoners, but I intend to join them. I have something they need. Something precious, something incredible. Not an object, but an experience. I know his secret.<br /><br />\\"I've seen Steelheart bleed.\\"<br /><br />Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.<br /><br />But Epics are no friend of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man you must crush his wills.<br /><br />Nobody fights the Epics... nobody but the Reckoners. A shadowy group of ordinary humans, they spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them.<br /><br />And David wants in. He wants Steelheart--the Epic who is said to be invincible. The Epic who killed David's father. For years, like the Reckoners, David's been studying, and planning--and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.<br /><br />He's seen Steelheart bleed. And he wants revenge.br /><br />\\"My name is David Charleston. I'm not one of the Reckoners, but I intend to join them.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Bought the first season of this for my husband after seeing one episode.  I knew it was a show he would like! We finished the first season in less than 2 weeks and he already wants to order the second! :)
0790729393|5.0|This is an &#34;old&#34; movie.  I have not watched the dvd, but I saw the movie on tv.  I liked it so much, that I thought I would add it to my collection.  The price was good, so I bought it.
B005LJETYI|4.0|Overall a great plot whose small flaws lie in a slow start and some moments of comic-book melodrama. Recommended for sure.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I rented this for $3.99 which is much less than a movie ticket these days.  The movie didn't make much sense to me.  On a scale of 1 - 10, I would give it a 4.  I was disappointed in the ending -- no magic there!
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This movie is just perfect, Perfect acting, Perfect effects, Perfect story, Perfect pacing. It's the greatest Super-Hero movie ever made and one of the greatest films period.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very good movie, my husband even enjoyed it. I enjoyed the story, the acting and the humor.  Emma Stone is always cute in her movies.
B004XWLN20|4.0|This set is awesome and has a lot of exclusive features. My only complaint is that the cardboard the discs are held in is really stiff and can sometimes make it pretty challenging to get the discs out. Besides that, this set is flawless!
B0011EU0NG|5.0|This is a classic!  Great family fun!  Enjoyable for all ages from Grandma right down to the toddlers!  Lots of action and laughs!
B00CZAYNOC|4.0|I like 5FDP and this album is no exception i like all there songs there all pretty rocking, go look up the songs on youtube first though to make sure you like them
0425263908|5.0|.This the first time to read her book. but I  did not want to put it down. Love the way she rights .  Have purchase two more of  her books
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|If you're taking a course on one of the languages offered on Duolingo, then this app is an absolutely excellent addition that will help you greatly. If you decide that you want to learn a language on your own, though, then you're probably going to have a rougher time of it.  The app is essentially a lot of quizzes about words and sentences, but provides very little in the way of real instructions. When you're first introduced to a new word, the app will generally help you with a definition, which works well enough with nouns, but the conjugations of verbs are something you pretty much have to figure out on your own.<br /><br />If you do want to learn a language on your own, then there are a lot of online resources that will help, and this app will definitely help you. On its own, though, its insufficient.
0425263924|5.0|Love  this book, you want to keep reading to know what is going on, cant wait for the next book.
0811876373|5.0|The book is excellent, but I didn't realize how much skill it takes to decorate the cake pops. I will try again.
0425263916|5.0|Love  this lady's  works, just want to keep reading  till you know what has taken place with the people  in her book, can't wait for  the next one.
B004Y042N8|3.0|The &quot;puzzles&quot; are good for mindless time-wasting, but they become ridiculously easy and monotonous if you know the &quot;secret&quot; (and, I assume, incredibly frustrating if you don't).
B00CF34B2I|3.0|I like the game, fun to play and learn. But I can't buy anything. In-app purchases won't work. I'm trying to buy another card deck and the dialog with the purchases button appears. But I can press the purchase button until the cows come home and it doesn't do anything.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Actually, 10 stars!  The cd was better than the original album and worth twice the selling price.  We miss you Jimi!
B008Y212PI|5.0|fun little game -didn't catch the fact that cubes had to touch unless space was indicated when viewing instructions,  but after figuring that out it was pretty entertaining.
B000002UVX|5.0|What surprises me is how many people have never heard this album/cd!  Terrific from beginning to the very end!  We miss you Jimi!  We miss you Buddy!
0920668372|4.0|My grands love this story so I gave it as a gift to my sister to read to her new granddaughter.<br />I think it's a great short book witj a sing-songy phase that kids respond to
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|You might read some reviews that hate on this book.<br /><br />They'll say they don't like his pseudo-scientific claims. They'll say he oversimplifies everything. They might even mention some \\"incidents\\" where they witnessed a deluge of \\"random\\" people who hated on this book... just a day after it's released.<br /><br />But I believe those people have an agenda. An agenda where they decided they were going to hate this book before they even read it.<br /><br />I'll explain.<br /><br />When I buy a Malcolm Gladwell book, I don't expect in-depth analysis of hundreds of research studies. For that, I'll turn to someone like Eliot Aronson, Dan Ariely, or some new blood like Adam Grant. When I buy a Malcolm Gladwell book I expect to read compelling stories that bring a few pieces of key research to life. I also expect to be inspired by these stories. And in that regard, David and Goliath OVER DELIVERS.<br /><br />#1 I loved the story of the impressionists<br /><br />I won't ruin the story for you because I think you should buy the book and read it. But the short of it is this: When the impressionists were shunned from the high art society in France, they created their own art show. And their art became more popular. And today, their art is essentially priceless since the art they were showing in their 'offsite' art show totaled more than billion dollars worth of art.<br /><br />What's funny about this story is the connection to Gladwell and today. Gladwell might get shunned by some nitpicking academics, and that's fine. He's not trying to break into the world of academia. He created his own world, and he's the guy selling millions of books.<br /><br />This doesn't mean I hate academia though. I run a website called Social Triggers, and a podcast called Social Triggers Insider. My goal? To share the research from academia in language that layman can understand. So I dig academia.<br /><br />That said, this story was inspiring because it reminds me (and I'm sure other people who read it) that it's not about being accepted by a system. Sometimes, you need to create your own system - and you'll be better off.<br /><br />#2 We should all remember the inverted U curve<br /><br />Again, Gladwell goes into this in more detail, but I loved this. It quite simply says, that just because you do more of something doesn't mean you're going to have more results. At some point, doing more can actually have the REVERSE effect. Doing more can actually make you do worse.<br /><br />Even though he didn't use this analogy, I think about going to the gym. When you go to the gym once a week, you get poor results. Go twice, and better results. Go three, and maybe better results. But if you go 7 times a week, twice a day, you risk 'overtraining' and when you overtrain you actually risk getting worse results.<br /><br />Based on those two stories alone, I believe this book is worth the read.<br /><br />Now back to the naysayers...<br /><br />The naysayers pick his books up and say it's too simple. And you know what? Just the other day, Gladwell said it best: \\"If my books appear oversimplified, then you shouldn't read them\\"<br /><br />Why is that best?<br /><br />Because if you think his books are too oversimplified, you shouldn't read them. You're NOT the audience.<br /><br />He's not writing a book to be consumed by 1,500 academics. He's writing a book to inspire millions of people.<br /><br />And that's why I have to say, Malcolm Gladwell did it again. Check the book out.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I don't have the game but the pictures look cool so I would totally get this game. I have seen reviews and they sound good.<br /><br />Get the game
B0016BP0PW|5.0|Loved this movie! Brilliant imagination at work! An era, and a generation retold in music and art. Just amazing! A must see.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|Kids enjoyed the songs and the funny antics.  Lots of laughs all around.  Danny Devito does a great job.  Has a good theme at the end but there are some scary parts with the monsters that might not be good for really little ones.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|It's a good looking toy/replica. I'm keeping my on display in box, so I can't really tell you how using it feels.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Great series! Incredible cast. Product new. I'm hooked on the series! Can't wait until next season! Recommend to everyone I know!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just what we've all been waiting for. Everyone talks about how scary Stephen King 's books are but I love the way he tells a story and makes you fall in love with the characters so you can't put the book down until you know what happens to them. Keep on keeping on Stephen. And thank you ever so much for years of anticipation and enjoyment of your next book.
B00DB2JQ7W|3.0|I have been a fan of Gov't Mule since the early days and still am a fan but this record does not do it for me.  I understand that Warren Haynes wants to progress and play music that is more appealing to a larger audience but he is getting too far away from what made them great in the first place , the blues-rock , hard rock sound.<br /><br />I still have alot of respect for these great musicians and will continue to support them and see them live but this is my least favorite of Gov't Mule's records by far.  Sorry to give a bad review to one of my favorite bands but I am truly disappointed with this one.
B0000683U7|5.0|Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. Interestingly this boxed set (ASIN: B0000683U7) is a wonderful commemorative edition. This DVD of the film is a beautiful transfer. In addition to the DVD, there is a set of reproduction Lobby Cards in color, a reproduction 1-Sheet Poster, b&w stills and interestingly there is an actual celluloid frame from a copy of the film. The sound has been remastered in stereo and sounds incredible compared to the VHS copies that were only available before this. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out. This DVD print is brilliantly sharp and exceptionally colorful. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene. Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love this band! The CD got to me just in time, it is great and I cannot get enough of it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Good fun movie, however I need an explanation as to the Spock the younger can talk to Spock the older if there is no time travel
B004EPYZP8|2.0|The DVD scratch.  It stopped for few minutes and it re-ran then played again. several of times through the movie.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was a great book<br />It was a really cool book I liked it I would definitely read it again
B00BUAEYVK|2.0|The DVD scratch therefore, it stopped for a minutes or two and plays again.  Constantly jamped through out the movie
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Sound is tight, though a bit bass-heavy. Guess you have to turn down any bass boost on the notion that they have &#34;flat&#34; response. Shut out most noise.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.I thought they fit the actors to the characters  part, very well. Love the new Captain!
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I whole heartedly believe and utilize the law of attraction in my every day life (I even teach workshops and classes on the subject) but after trying two of the books exercises to &#34;test&#34; the universe I came out empty handed. I followed the instructions completely but did not see any results. I don't disbelieve in the power of the universe or my own inner creative power but i do feel this book is not instructive or helpful enough to make the claims it makes. The book does not mention what to do if you aren't getting results (hello back up plan ?) So it leaves readers like me who have no other choice but to lay the book to rest. I enjoy the concept of the book but these exercises have not helped me create or bring about this universal proof it so confidently proclaims. My advice is to give it a try (hey maybe it works for you) but if after 1-2 exercises give it up and hope the author comes out with the next book titled: What To Do When My Last Book Didn't Work For You.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|I was tired and it didn't keep me awake hehe, but the parts I remember was fun and it is always fun to see all these famous actors together.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Great movie and great soundtrack.  Cast is great too.  Lots of comedy as well as seriousness.  Beautiful scenery and makes you want to retire to a quite life in the South of France.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Got the movie real fast. The book was better but I understand that if they followed the whole book, the movie would have been a few hours long. All in all, great movie.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Seth Rogen is great as the voice of Paul.  Steller cast as well.  Love the movie.  Even makes you think a little.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|A need for any Saw fan, seeing as it gives even more insight into the series than just listening to commentaries.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Good book it's very good if your are reading this do  be read the book I promise you will love it
B00006FDCD|5.0|Fot a TV movie its one of the best fright nights ever. Fun to watch with older kids . A great Halloween pumpkin carving party flick

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love the series and this one was no exception. WELL worth adding to my DVD library. Enjoyed it very much ~
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thank You for sending this product - It works so much better than the original that came with my Kindle Fire
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Watched this with my kids. It was their first time watching it. They loved it!!! Just like I did, and still do.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A very addictive and enjoyable game. It took me a few tries, before I really got the hang of it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Of course, I love it like everyone else does.  If you like quality, historical literary period pieces, with a great story, you will love this series.  I am hooked and can't stop watching.  Each episode ends with a bit of a cliff hanger, as one would expect.  Great writing, stellar acting and wow! what a backdrop......  What's not to like?
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I found this game to be frustrating at best - the symbols were very difficult to differentiate.  Time to try another Mahjong.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I almost lost faith with Nalini Singh and was ready to write her off as much as I have Lora Leigh. However, she has redeemed herself with this book. Please make more books from the Psy perspective Ms. Singh!<br /><br />So many other authors are already doing the animal/human dynamic to death with romances today, while the Psy-type characters have no other relative equal in the market. Plus, the last book Tangle of Need gave me whiplash from the perpetual switching of view and need to delve my memory for the other random couples from the books that really didn't add to the overall world-building. In all honesty, I ended up skipping a few before A Kiss of Snow because they looked so boring and repetitive without addressing characters I cared about or integral issues as to the overall plot of the series. She really got me in Slave to Sensation, so I am glad that I stuck with the series for the most part.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Overcoming the Silence of the Psy upbringing brings so much more to the overall appreciation of the romance the characters finally attain. For others in doubt with the series, read this one and you will be back in the fold. Especially, with how this book ended, she has a huge open canvas to better concentrate on the strengths of the world she created.<br /><br />Get back into the series by reading this one, or at least Kiss of Snow and then this one (sorry to Ms. Singh but Tangle of Need was sub-par and unneeded), to find the potential she created with her first wonderful book in the series.
0345803485|4.0|Love the story line can't wait to see the movie coming out next year I believe it is. #latersbabe #
B001I8A76A|3.0|Granted, most all of the songs on this album are labeled as 'explicit', but I had hoped for more of the real Pink's voice to shine through on this one, but I'm afraid that I was disappointed.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Saw this on netflix and was hooked. Neil Patrick Harris does an awesome job paying an evil genious. This is a musical, and very well done. A little twisted as we're not cheering on the conventional hero, but the bad guy. But nontheless entertaining. I love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book to be thought provoking....what would I do if I had discovered a letter like the one in the story?  I experienced many emotions when I read this book and would very highly recommend it....the story was touching and I felt it had a powerful ending.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|always love BonJovi, you can't go wrong with any of their songs.  Liked the free download. I just wish i could get it onto my itunes.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Like the twist and turn of Spark books. You never know the whole story until the end. Never the same twist. True love story.
B0096BIENY|5.0|love the compilation of songs on this.  You get a good selection of their talent. I would recommend it as an introduction this talented group!
0920668372|5.0|When my wife and I first started reading this book, we agreed it was a bit odd and almost creep, but the ending brings it back around.  It's a cute story, with a different writing style/structure.  Worth a try.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome as my title if you don't like it you are crazy  and there is no things wrong with it
1932907009|5.0|This book does a great job of breaking down the components of a great script. If you can read and follow the individual steps, you'll right a good story.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game! Wish it wouldn't freeze so much. But non the less I love it so I continue to play.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Good quality video, a great series, and Claire Danes, an exceptional actress.  Three things that make this purchase an  outstanding value.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Fascinating reading. Even for someone not computer friendly. Well written. Capturing the complexity of this man is not an easy task but the author does so brilliantly!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|Love this movie. The detail is incredible, makes me want to read the book all over again! :O) Characters were cast perfectly.
B005PW3OS8|3.0|Lots of action and adventure, but sad the captain didn't get the girl at the end. My slow dsl internet made streaming of the movie breakup.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was late to read this because I just wasn't sure about it but it actually is a great story!!
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|I really didn't see the movie. I tried to stream it on my new Roku 2 box, but the movie would not load because of not enough bandwidth. I will have to wait to watch the movie on DirecTV I guess.:)
B000UVT3OI|1.0|The set had two of the SAME CD!!!!! It was supposed to have disc one and disc two of Garth's greatest hits! It was supposedly new, so it came from the manufacturer this way. The CDs said disc 1 and disc 2, but both had all the same songs on them!
1401938906|5.0|Lovely sense of humor makes is such an easy read.<br />Also explanation of scientific information given very simply so everyone can understand it.<br />Lots of good fun too.<br />thanks
0307730700|5.0|I'm really picky about what I choose to read since I have very little free time. I'm a father of three toddlers, all boys, so my free time is limited. I found myself making extra time to read each day. His testimony is so great and so moving. Although I knew his death was inevitable, I couldn't help but wish it wasn't so. Great book, amazing story. I found myself thanking God for all my blessing in my life and for the opportunity to be a husband and a father.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|The book is written in the eyes of the child, so it does take some used to understanding the ebb and flow of the narration.  It keeps you engaged as this little boy sees the world for the first time and experiences all there is to offer.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|It is action packed, how did they do that, keep you on the edge of your seat kind of movie. We actually saw it in the theater first and after it was over I wanted to stay and watch it again. It is that good. So, of course I had to own it. That way I can watch it whenever I want. Awesome. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and family.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This is a great movie!  Very moving.<br />I have bought this for several people and<br />they all loved it.  Thank you.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|What you expect from Bay....Great action!  Story tied up nicely!  I don't get wrapped up in the lore of the Transformers World.  Just watch the movie and enjoy it for what it is!
B000XPOB0M|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for awhile and couldn't find it anywhere... Decided to check amazon, of course they had it and a great price too!! I personally like these kinds of movies and Hilary Swank did a great job. I'm sure not everyone will like it but for me its a &#34;buyer&#34;!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Love the video love the game but once I played it on my samsung galaxy 4 I couldn't get it to stop nor could I exit out of the game. I had to uninstall it to make it stop. Darn it was so fun and cute!
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Great suspense, and always has cool surprises.<br />Angel is a favorite character.<br />Makes you think twice about who surrounds you in the supermarket.
1400052181|5.0|Rebecca Skloot is to be commended for her patience in getting the Lacks family to give her the information she needed to make people aware of some of the things that are happening in the field of medicine.  They have come much further & changed some of the ways they handle things. Makes you stop & think & ask questions the next time you enter a hospital & fill in the forms they give you to sign.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I like that there are so many different puzzles. I don't like that it sho jonggws you the matches .Thats it
044024613X|5.0|Makes you think about genetics vs. environment.  The effects certain actions have on various members of a family.  Good vs. bad.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold are back with a pretty decent follow up to Nightmare. You can here a lot of Avenged's influences such as, Metallica, Guns N Roses and Megadeth.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I wish there was more of a story line helping you with the game. Its like your trying to find your way out of the monestery with no guidance.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like the way the available tiles are a little bit brighter than the tiles that are unable to move. In the Microsoft version it's difficult to tell which tiles are raised. This version is easier on the eyes so play is quicker. I find myself playing this often.
0811870413|5.0|This book is a 5 star rating due to its excelent recipes, exceptional pictures and great paper quality!<br />I will recomend to everyone I Know who likes to cook breads.
B00DTOZD4C|5.0|Mr. Jonasson has his own version of history and relates an immensely enjoyable and improbable tale of the life that &#34;happened to a man who reaches the age of 100 and decides to start again...
B006O6FK2W|3.0|&#34;The Bat&#34; where do I start?<br /><br />BAD: It's not even close to 1:18 scale, the fly me handle on top ruins what little resemblance to the movie vehicle it has, and worst of all the entire under body is hollow.<br /><br />GOOD: The launching flight attack Batman is a cool gimmick, and it works very well.  He is a soft foam/plastic hybrid &#34;figure&#34; more of a statue, but he glides pretty far.  The toy looks good from the front.<br /><br />OTHER: I bought this toy knowing full well that I'd scrap it for custom parts/bashing, so I wasn't disappointed in it for what I paid.  Definitely not worth the original retail cost of $30!!!  Not even half that IMO.  Hasbro has really been cheeping out on the super hero movie line toys the past few years. It's become common that the entire under side of vehicles are just an empty hollow shell, with no attempt to cover it.  It's like a two dimensional toy. :(<br /><br />I am a 36 year old avid toy collector.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|How this movie didn't get more publicity i don't know?<br />Watched it several times still laugh at the thing well acted and great computer animation of Paul
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Great songs with intelligent and catchy lyrics, a real wordsmith! Love the production and the playing I would reccomend this album to fans of any style of music.
0486278077|5.0|There's a reason why this book has withstood the tests of time.  Forget Christian Grey, your time is better spent reading Dorian Gray.  Way ahead of it's time, the classic tale of love, loss, and the thirst for eternal youth.  Forget everything you've seen in the movies and read &#34;The Picture of Dorian Gray.&#34;
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Thought provoking and you will sing along! This belongs in every music collection, you will love it, you will tell others!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie is great for gamers, but anyone else can enjoy it too. It's a heartwarming story and has a fun graphic style.
B008Y212PI|5.0|The puzzles are challenging and fun.  I enjoy solving them and finding out what the picture really is.  Would like to order more of these!
0316056898|5.0|I must admit, I'm already a big Tina Fey fan (SNL, 30 Rock, among other things), and when you read this book, you can hear her voice in your head. It's a very fun read, and insightful as well. I actually prefer it to the audiobook - I read this first, and for fun we decided to try her digital audiobook as well, but in the first 5-10 minutes it wasn't as good as how she read it in my own mind, so we returned that. She shares openly about life with her husband, becoming a mom, and gaining footing in the entertainment industry.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|This is one of my favorite series.  Kevin Spacey is absolutely terrific! I hated seeing the series conclude. I purchased copies to give to my kids.
386521584X|5.0|This is a book anybody interested in photography must see.<br />A seminal work that changed photography ever since and is still relevant today.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I love movies like these with mythical creatures (Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/Percy Jackson etc.) and Blu Ray to boot. I like the idea of having the extra DVD as I do have another room with a standard DVD player that can use it. Additionally the digital copy lets me to download the movie on my laptop so when I'm at the airport or on a long flight I can watch it without having to carry extra DVDs around.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|It was a great price and was in very good condition.  We still have 2 more to watch and can't wait to enjoy!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a great game. I really like playing it on my Kindle. I was a great find. I am glad I purchased it.
140006922X|4.0|The main thing that I realized early on is that one needs to have a well rounded knowledge in religious history in order to fully appreciate Zealot. I'm Episcopalian, non-prejudiced, and believe in God, but unfortunately I lack the depth of religious history necessary for grasping this book. Therefore, I keep trying to find excuses to avoid picking it up and reading any further, unlike if I were anxiously reading a good David Baldacci, Michael Connelly or Greg ILes novel. Sorry, a well written documentary such as Zealot is just not my cup of tea.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It is all right but it takes forever to download. I only got two diffrent test runs. I was hoping for more control over him. You would have to have 15 fingers to play.
B000I5SY5U|3.0|I saw this a few days after seeing the stage production at the St. Louis. rep.  The story and songs were entirely different.  The  stage production was infinitely easier to understand and more substantive .
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I only got to play it a few times but is as fun as the others. Great mindless fun. Watch how everyone is used.
B009A87X80|5.0|I was introduced to Eva Cassidy by a friend who knows I like older jazz and big-band style music.  This lady has an amazing voice.  A nice change from modern pop.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|What a tragic time to live thru.  Slavery was barbaric!<br />Lavina, the slave owners wife however, was as &#34;enslaved&#34; as her servants due to the fact that women had no rights.
1416511946|5.0|I love this band so I thought I would see what Nikki Sixx is all about and I was totally in love with this book. He doesn't leave anything out and in the end, I found him very endearing. He's a very intelligent man and has been through so much. Highly recommend for anyone who likes Autobiographies.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Prefer the prior Robert Redford iteration: This version was far too frenetic, and - with the rich catalog of period-appropriate music from that era - the contemporary soundtrack was completely disjunct and incongruous...
B00E9P959O|5.0|This remix is incredible, it's a shame what was done to the original mix once you hear the clarity and precision that is Rush finally brought out.  These songs might as well be all new, the genesis of Clockwork Angels is finally revealed in songs like Sweet Miracle, and the beauty of masterpieces like Ceiling Unlimited and Peaceable Kingdom can really be appreciated.  This is a must for any true Rush fan.
B00004U8P9|5.0|WHAT IS NOT TO LOVE?<br />WAS A TEEN THROUGH THE CULT YEARS.<br />ATTENDED MANY, MANY MIDNIGHT SHOWS.<br />STILL LOVE AND FOLLOW TIM CURRY!!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|To say this series in season one has impeccable writing and story line, would be to say breathing is a oxygenated experience. Every episode is edge of your seat stuff. I find it interesting they knew about Congressman Anthony Wiener among other things before they ever happened.<br />Great series can't wait to see season two.
159514188X|5.0|The plot was not without flaws. There were a few times that I was rolling my eyes because it was cheesy, but I do have to say that the book was insightful, and it made me think about lot and for this I cannot give this book anything less then five stars.<br />The book brought out two very important points. One was that we only see what we want to see. If a person is on the verge of committing suicide then there are signs but people will ignore them or choose not to see certain things.<br />The second important thing about this book is everyone does small things that are nothing to them but they mean everything to another person. A lot of these characters in this book we not in any way evil but they made mistakes and they didn't think about how other people might feel when they said certain things.<br />The main character went through a lot, although it might not seem like it, but it all added up and it made her seem like she couldn't trust anyone and she felt like she had no one to turn too. It might have seemed like she didn't try hard enough but she kinda did just not in obvious ways.<br />The thing that I hated about this book was the fact that you had to focus on two things happening at the same time. If you are not in a quiet room where there are no distractions then all I have to tell you is good luck. This book goes back from what Hannah is saying and what Clay is doing the whole time and it gets confusing. I do not like the way the author wrote it. It made the book better but it also made it very hard to follow.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Well done love the story line, writing was great. This was fun to watch and made the problems of the world go away for the length of the movie. Brilliant
B00AJLHUWQ|4.0|After the intense and very enjoyable Second Life Syndrome, I decided this would be my second foray into Riverside. Talk about being thrown a curve! Here I am expecting something in the direction of that album (granted there have been at least two in between these two...). Instead, I get the same group doing things very differently. In a much more... for lack of a better word, relaxed, mode. There is even a strong bow to 1940s/50s bar music (including a saxophone) in one song. OK...now I have no idea how to truly \\"classify\\" this band. Maybe, this is one of the endearing parts of this music...<br /><br />However, rather than being unfocused, as this sort of direction might indicate, these guys are really on top of their music. While I was looking for more of SLS, I get a much broader sampling of art rock, especially with influences from Deep Purple, Genesis, and Marillion rising to the surface. Yet, they are still their own band. These guys are really good and are, musically, very brave. They take deliberate twists and turns that would likely ruin many other bands. Not them.<br /><br />The album opens with the only song on this album I don't really care for. It is not a boring song, I just have not been able to connect with the opening vibe and it doesn't really connect musically with the rest of the album (which is an interesting paradox in itself). After that, this album is great! I struggle with picking a 'best song' because it doesn't really seem fair to the rest of the work they have done on this album. Each song is discrete, different, yet, somehow (with the exception of the 1st) seems to belong here.<br /><br />Celebrity Touch has a very direct, attacking beat. That is quickly followed by We Got Used to Us which has a beautiful \\"shadowing\\" guitar voice that hearkens back to a few of Blue Oyster Cult's better solos. That is followed by Deprived, which opens with a bit of a Pink Floyd/Marillion sonic and ends with a saxophone that reminds the listener of music from a 1940s or '50s private eye movie. The title track then comes storming back with their most intense, \\"proggy\\" sound on the whole album, made all the more intense because of the highly varied dynamics...hopefully you are starting to get the idea... this album goes \\"where it wants to\\", and yet is anything but \\"A.D.D.\\"...<br /><br />As if to further emphasize their apparent eclecticism, we have the bonus disc. There are two tracks on this disc, entitled Night Sessions. If I hadn't seen this come out of the same jewel case, I would have a hard time identifying this as a Riverside disc. Whereas the first disc hints at various art rock groups from the '70s and '80s, this second disc speaks strongly of mid 80s to mid 90s Tangerine Dream....Yep! It is that kind of \\"new age\\" electronic music, except that it is interspersed with just enough difference to not consider it a true Tangerine Dream knock off. They do utilize a lot of \\"non-electric instrument voices\\", but this is a two piece (definitely not songs) bow to the various trips Tangerine Dream used to take with their synths. There is some limited vocals layered in the background, but no words that I could discern. Somehow, after hearing the first disc, the feel of the second does tend to connect the two, but only in an almost subconscious fashion. Overall, this second disc is completely unexpected, yet entertaining, as long as you are not looking for music that relates to their previous efforts.<br /><br />These guys are apparently unfettered by the \\"expectations/requirements\\" of the music industry...either that or they just don't care. Perhaps that is an advantage of coming from Poland? Regardless, this is very good for you and I. This is really engaging, enjoyable music. This will draw you in from curiosity time and time again. Another excellent album from Riverside.om a 1940s or '50s private eye movie.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I didn't realize when I first began to play this game that there was a short time limit to play a card. Now that I know, I enjoy playing it more and quicker. Some people do tend to play aggressively, so watch out!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I know I'm a bit behind, finishing this a full week after its release, but here goes, and I will try to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />As a huge fan of Brandon Sanderson's *Epic* (haha) fantasy novels, I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up Steelheart, other than I would probably like it, since I liked everything else.<br /><br />Firstly, it was a much shorter read than I am used to, which is not necessarily a bad thing.  It took me three days, in which I was working full time and had a weekend that was more fast paced than a NASCAR race.  My bad metaphors are influenced by the fact that I just finished Steelheart, which abounds with them.<br /><br />I feel it necessary to point out that it took me a third of the book to realize it was written in first-person perspective, not something I am strictly against, but after Mistborn, Warbreaker, Elantris, and The Way of Kings, not something I'm used to either, but I think it works, though Sanderson does have a tendency to stray into the overly sarcastic, self-deprecating humor that often happens with first-person narrative.<br /><br />This was also the first book where I was able to spot the character twists, which in other books I like to call the &#34;curse-your-sudden-but-inevitable-betrayal&#34; character.  I don't know if this is a side effect of knowing that one (or more than one in the case of certain books) character(s) are not what they seem, or if it was due to the shorter nature of the book that didn't allow for quite as much burial of subtle hints. Either way, if I hadn't been reading his books for years, I probably wouldn't have seen it coming.<br /><br />Overall I thought it was a good read, it kept me wanting to return to it every chance I got, and I am looking forward to the sequel, Firefight.
B000SJZJPY|5.0|by far one of the best clapton albums. The vinyl came in great shape and sounds awesome. Thanks for the product
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I thought this movie was very entertaining.  Great actors and the setting made you feel like you were there.  I
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I enjoy this app.  My problem with this app is the fact that I cannot upgrade it.  There is one place on the activity selections screen that keeps saying &#34;coming soon&#34; that has not changed in the last 2 years.  Would like to upgrade in order to utilize the newer app, but no go.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|This was a good movie that definitely surprised me. It was not what I expected, but definitely has that comic book feel. If you are curious check it out, I was not dissapointed.
B00DHHWY9I|3.0|I like the special effects of the movie, but it doesn't compare to the original. Shipping was fast and price very reasonable for blue ray
B00932AA5G|4.0|Insanity from beginning to end this movie is rare gem. Definitely strange but oh so good, it goes there and delivers with violence and intensity, so enthralling you barely notice the subtitles.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This is a great story! I could have written it. I was not going to rent it because I despise Barbra Streisand's big mouth political views. However, after putting that aside because I do like her as an actress and I needed something to watch on my plane trip, I am glad I did. Seth Rogan was perfect as the son and the story line where son and mother finally understand one another at the end reminded me of one of my favorite old movies: Mother with Debbie Reynolds and Albert Brooks. I would watch both again.
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|I have seen this movie so many times, and watched the animated series as well. The characters are so good,and the humor is for all ages, Izma and Kronk are some of the best bad guys ever, while the story of the emperor still rings clear and true. Recommended for kids and adults alike.
B005T9ZTSU|1.0|It's buggy link to the website. Nothing like what's inthe pictures or the app I used on my iphone. Perhaps it's because I'm outside the US at the moment Amazon detects this and foists this gag version of the app.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Characters and voices were great. It was a great story of accepting differences, and a new storyline for the ghosts and ghouls context. Not just for Halloween, you can watch this anytime.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It's a depressing topic, you will be in a dark mood when you finish the book. At least though, there is a twinge of hope that someone else will be helped. I remember high school. I had the same hopes as the main narrator and i had similar experiences with several letdowns. High school was the most miserable time of my life, Fortunately i never let go of hope for a better life. It really does get better in the end. If I were a high school english teacher I would have my classes read and discuss the book. I feel like teenagers need to read something like this and talk it out with someone about ways to handle these emotions and these situations. Without someone to talk to, at that age, it could just make people darker, more lost.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|Did a good job of being &#34;austeny&#34;. The mystery was well done, and it was not clear who the murderer was until the very end. Would make a good movie for sure!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This was a great surprise for my 10 year old ggson. He was not aware Minecraft came in Lego Minecraft. He could not<br />put it down. Now he wants the other sets. Such a wonderful challenge and he loved it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Was a great cast, well done, just enough seriousness with some fun moments. Ben Affleck was great. This is a story made for movies, and it lived up to its potential.
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|As a teacher, I enjoy reading this book to the youth in my class.  They enjoy it as much as I did when I was young.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Has a southern charms, and brings something different to the witches, vampires, and werewolfs genre. Is the 1st in a series and while I bought the 2nd one, have not gotten to it yet. Pulls you in, but not a cult classic.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is such a great movie about bravery, tragedy, family, faith, and determination.  What a great testimony to such an amazing woman!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The 1st and 2nd seasons were phenomenal, and this one is very good, but I felt there was a little something missing, Overall, still one of the best shows on television.
0385528787|4.0|This review contains some spoilers for the other two books in the trilogy, so skip this if you haven't read those. My review for Oryx and Crake is here, and my review for The Year of the Flood is  here.<br /><br />I read MaddAddam, the third and final book in Margaret Atwood's dystopian trilogy of the same name, in an indulgent fervor. I neglected my own writing regime to read it, read it past my bedtime. I went camping this past weekend, and instead of hiking or moving around in some semblance of an athletic and rugged way, I set up my tent and curled up on top of my sleeping bag to read more MaddAddam. I consumed the book, swallowed it whole. It's hard to tell if I liked it or not--I am pretty sure I did--but I can say with certainty that I was engaged with it.<br /><br />Ok, so the book itself: unlike Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood, where much of the action and plot really takes place in the book's narrative past through the use of flashbacks the action in MaddAddam is pretty evenly split between the book's diegetic present and past. There's even, at the end, a bit of diegetic future thrown in. In my review of The Year of the Flood I discussed how the first two books of this trilogy were mirror images--structurally similar but inverted in terms of their themes and respective focus. I wondered if MaddAddam would follow suit or attempt to unify the other two books. MaddAddam, I think, establishes itself firmly as a concluding volume through its attempt to unify the other two books in the series. MaddAddam picks up right where The Year of the Flood leaves off and carries the narrative thread of what happens to Toby and Ren and Jimmy in the book's present, that is in the lonely aftermath of Crake's Waterless Flood. At the end of the previous book, the Crakers--Crake's genetically engineered `perfect' humans, part of whose perfection seems to be an utterly guileless nature--set free a pair of vicious criminals into the woods. Much of the plot of MaddAddam is driven by this pair of murderer/rapist/all around evil guys as they skulk around the protagonists' homestead, pick off the wildlife, and engage in a lot of psychological warfare. The book's resolution, such as it is, comes as a result of a climactic standoff between the protagonists, the MaddAddamites, and the criminals in the Paradice Dome where the Crakers were engineered. Intercut with this is the story of Zeb, a MaddAddamite and former God's Gardener who ends up as Toby's lover, was Ren's stepfather, and knew Crake when Crake was a boy. The origins of the God's Gardeners cult is revealed through Zeb's back story, and through him we get deeper insights into the ever-enigmatic mad scientist Crake.<br /><br />That's the plot, but like with all of Atwood's work the plot plays second fiddle to its themes. One of those themes is the power of narrative. This theme has been a unifying point through all three books, though how it's been perceived and presented has varied from character to character. While the other two books in the trilogy are fairly straightforward in terms of how they're told, this one is more complicated. In Oryx and Crake and in The Year of the Flood the story is revealed through one or two people's viewpoints, and those viewpoints are static inasmuch that we know it's Jimmy or Toby or Ren thinking these thoughts, having these memories, experiencing this or that thing. MaddAddam confuses things: Toby is the protagonist, for the most part, but what we, the readers, actually get is a mix of Toby's thoughts, Toby's experiences, Toby's retellings of other people's stories and, eventually, other people retelling Toby's story. What we find out about Zeb's history is both in and not in his voice--the stories start from Toby's perspective as the pair lay together in the dark, and eventually Zeb's voice appears to take over. Occasionally the stride of his voice is broken when Toby interrupts. Then, Toby takes his stories and translates them into myth and legend for the Crakers. Toby herself becomes both the teller of tales to the Crakers and a tale to be told by the Crakers by the end of the book. While Jeanette Winterson in Weight dealt with how we use narrative to construct ourselves Atwood here is highlighting the power of shared narratives to construct a community. It's a theme that richly permeates the book, start to finish, in both subtle and obvious ways. It's a theme that builds on pieces from the other two books. It's masterfully done, especially given that there is so much potential for an approach to narrative this way to be confusing but the book remains clear throughout.<br /><br />So, that's one theme I saw coming long before I cracked open the book. Way back in Oryx and Crake I picked up on the idea that Atwood was writing these books to show us how redemptive and damning narrative can be, that we can change our trajectories by changing the kinds of stories we tell ourselves. That's what speculative fiction is all about. But there was something else which crystallized in MaddAddam a theme, or rather an open question, which I did not see coming. Maybe I'm the only one who didn't, I don't know. The question is this: what is it that makes us worth saving? This questions starts about humanhood--what makes us human? Are the Crakers, with their genetic modifications and guileless, deeply innocent frame to the world, are they human? What does it mean if they aren't? What does it mean if they are? While these questions have been lurking along the outskirts of the text in both Oryx and Crake and The Year of the Flood they come to the forefront when Toby and Ren bring a very sick Jimmy to the MaddAddamite compound and the Crakers insist on following. The MaddAddamites propose scientific delineations: are the Crakers capable of abstract thought, can they produce viable offspring with a normal human, etc.<br /><br />The question of humanhood turns into a question of personhood over the course of the book. The Pigoons, huge pigs engineered to grow replacement organs for the human elite including human neocortex brain tissue, end up in an alliance with the MaddAddamites. The Pigoons have been around since the very start of the series--Jimmy's father used to work on them in one of the science Corps--and hints have been dropped along the way that they have developed sentience. But, still, the moment where one of the young Crakers literally communicates with a Pigoon and serves as a translator between the Pigoons and the MaddAddamites is a moment of profound strangeness not least because it shakes what we construct as personhood at its foundations. And in that moment, we gain great insight into Crake's plan, his vision, his reasons for spreading a swift and deadly plague across the world. If the natural world demands we adapt or die, then the only way destructive humanity as it exists to adapt is to die, for us to replace ourselves with more harmonious creatures, for us to make space for something to be a person besides ourselves. The moment this happens is wrapped up in a swiftly moving plot, with little textual time to chew over it or ponder it. I wanted the book to slow down a second, to unpack it, but it pushed on ahead.<br /><br />I rate this book 4 stars because it's close to perfect but not quite. A side plot of the book, the search for Adam One of the God's Gardeners cult, fizzles and dies without the emotional resonance it needed. I could have done without some of Toby's repetitive insecurities about her relationship with Zeb--while realistic I feel they defanged her character somewhat, which was a pity since she's such a tough, strong, fallible and emotionally truthful character. And, as I said, the pacing of the plot sometimes ran roughshod over the thematic developments. In spite of all that, MaddAddam is a wonderful and rich book in its own right, peculiar and heavy, and a masterful end to a trilogy. In terms of its ability to deepen and provide closure to a very goodseries of books it reminds me of Pullman's The Amber Spyglass*.<br /><br />*If you haven't read Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy you really, really should.s, huge pigs engineered to grow replacement organs for the human elite including human neocortex brain tissue, end up in an alliance with the MaddAddamites.

I was not disappointed. The characters were true to Miss Austen's originals and the few differences were explained by events that took place in between P&P and this story.  The plot was engaging and kept me guessing throughout the book.  I highly recommend this book!

140006922X|2.0|Reza Aslan was not totally honest in his interviews about his academic background and his lack of specialization in Early Christianity and prior publishing on this subject show.  Anything about religion can be contentious these days, but using generalized footnotes and explanations at the end of chapters instead of actual, specific footnotes makes it difficult to fact check.  Just one example is Aslan's claim that Jews used crucifixion during this period of time flies in the face of what most scholars and armchair historians like me know about the practice of Judaism during that time.  Aslan states over and over how the New Testament is not an historical work.  Most scholars agree.  Then he uses it as supporting facts for his claims.  His bibliography is missing some of the most recent and better known scholarship about Jesus and the time -- especially the parts about Jesus being a Zealot (but not an actual Zealot) because Aslan knows that Zealots were not contemporaneous with Jesus. Then he goes on to use  the language and imagery about Zealots and applies it to Jesus anyway.  Provocative, yes.  Accurate scholarship, no.  Makes me wonder about his other works.
B004J09ONG|5.0|I really enjoyed this true story. While people seldom think of the consequences of what they do this movie points out the importance of leaving what is wild, wild. For every action there is a reaction. I just loved that Elsa was able to return to the wild yet never forgot who her human parents were.

Even though it's the end of the world as we know it and humankind is at the edge of extinction, Ms. Atwood manages to entertain.  I recommend the first two books, Oryx and Crate, The Year of the Flood, but it is not necessary to read the first two to enjoy this one.

B0036TGT2A|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister and couldn't help but grab myself a copy as well.<br />When we were kids, my sister was obsessed with this movie...enough to have literally worn out the VHS tape from how many times she watched it on a daily basis.<br />We tease her about it all the time, and now she can rewatch the discs as many times as she wants as well as watch the digital copy on the go!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I dislike reviews that offer plot summaries, so I will simply say that this novel handles a potentially depressing topic with grace and delicacy.  It is not 5 star literature, in that the quality of the writing ads up to it being a bit of a beach novel, but that did not detract from my over-all enjoyment of the book. I look forward to reading her newest novel and enthusiastically recommend Me Before You.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|In my review of Book 4, I suspected that George RR Martin's continually branching story of the Starks', Lannisters' and Targarians' misadventures was never going to converge with any finality. In Book 5, he proved that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, he cannot or will not pull any of his narratives together. I can imagine that he gets up every morning, sits down at his keyboard and types away, forever adding details and nuance and character. He has drawn so much praise for his prose and plotting that I suspect that the act of concluding a story fills him with dread, either because he fears he cannot do all the setup justice or he fears that a conclusion to the story will somehow halt the gravy train.<br /><br />Sadly, this dedicated reader has lost his patience. The books have gone from novel to serial, the book form of soap opera; a never-ending melodrama. What pulled me along through the first 3 books was the desire to see how it would end. What GOT IV and V have taught me is that the chief object of the Game of Thrones is to never finish writing it.

B00AQ08W22|1.0|This remake demonstrates how to make a REALLY BAD action film -- and there are a lot of them out there!<br /><br />The main problem is that this film is missing the HUMAN ELEMENT. There are no CHARACTERS we can love, hate, admire, or care about in any way. They're all one-dimensional stick figures. And if you don't care about the characters, you can't be engaged in their struggle.<br /><br />The script is so SIMPLISTIC, in a typically bad action movie way. The evil (dictatorship, corporation, empire, military, whatever) is entirely evil. The good guys (rebels, resistance, revolutionaries, whatever) are entirely noble. No nuances, moral dilemmas, etc. Compare that to [[ASIN:B001I189MQ The Dark Knight]], in which Batman's moral role as a vigilante was questioned, the Joker observing that Batman was seen as a freak by the very people he was defending.<br /><br />Even worse, in this TOTAL RECALL remake (and in a typically bad action film sort of way), no good guy is AT RISK. It's one of those films where hundreds of (storm troopers, soldiers, gangsters, whatever) shoot a bajillion zillion bullets the Good Guy, and not one of them strikes. And because you KNOW that not a single bullet will hit the Good Guy, there's ZERO SUSPENSE. This film was just one long, extended, two-hour chase sequence/gun battle, yet despite that, I was BORED.<br /><br />Any ONE slasher in a horror film racks up a higher body count that the literally hundreds of evil robots shooting a bajillion bullets in this TOTAL RECALL remake. Isn't it sad, when a low-budget slasher film is actually more suspenseful and exciting than this ($100 million plus?) studio effort?<br /><br />Compare this TOTAL RECALL remake to one of the best action films ever: [[ASIN:6304711891 The Rock]]. There you had not two sides, but five \\"sides\\" -- most of them complex and morally ambiguous. A film full of twists and surprises. There was the 1. Terrorist/Military Hero, who had noble motives and whose intent turned out to be decent, 2. the Establishment Cops who were fighting the terrorist, yet through immoral means, 3. the Hero Cop, Nicolas Cage, who betrayed his cop bosses, 4, the Prisoner, Sean Connery, a villain who was charged with rescuing the day from the terrorist, and 5. the Terrorist Rebels, who suddenly betrayed their leader, for even more immoral reasons and intent.<br /><br />The fewer chases and pyrotechnics in [[ASIN:6304711891 The Rock]] were more exciting, because I cared about its morally complex characters/sides, and was constantly surprised by unexpected plot twists.<br /><br />Whereas this TOTAL RECALL remake was one long, paint-by-number, predictable snoozefest. While watching the incessant chases, I was actually wondering about the CGI budget, and various other things, instead of being emotionally involved with the events onscreen.cent, 2. the Establishment Cops who were fighting the terrorist, yet through immoral means, 3. the Hero Cop, Nicolas Cage, who betrayed his cop bosses, 4, the Prisoner, Sean Connery, a villain who was charged with rescuing the day from the terrorist, and 5. the Terrorist Rebels, who suddenly betrayed their leader, for even more immoral reasons and intent.<br /><br />The fewer chases and pyrotechnics in [[ASIN:6304711891 The Rock]] were more exciting, because I cared about its morally complex characters/sides, and was constantly surprised by unexpected plot twists.<br /><br />Whereas this TOTAL RECALL remake was one long, paint-by-number, predictable snoozefest.

This was followed up at various theaters over the years, then VHS, then Canadian TV, etc.  I spent some time as a youngster in the film's locale.<br /><br />It is never explained why Neddy Merrill (Burt Lancaster) has embarked on the grand project of swimming across Fairfield County via his neighbors' swimming pools.  We receive hints about his charming wife, his lovely daughters, their success in tennis and his career in Manhattan.  A confident and sociable fellow, he is delighted to catch up on news from his neighbors.  Some are pleased - or at least curious -  to see him; some aren't.  Hour by hour, pool by pool, the encounters grow colder and more abrupt. In cutting a broad swath through this suburban nirvana, Neddy has left a trail of unpaid bills, damaged relationships and human wreckage.  The climax is his confrontation with a former lover (Janice Rule, in a brilliant performance).  As a storm breaks, Neddy comes home to a big empty house, pounding helplessly on the locked door.<br /><br />The story plays out with dazzling cinematography of the sun-dappled countryside and a stirring score by Marvin Hamlisch.

Graphics and sound are awesome, and the physics of the game seem realistic. Having the little guide line is helpful for gameplay, but I'm certain that's why my skills seem better in game. If you enjoy pool and computer versions, definitely worth checking out!

0525478817|5.0|Powerful, deep, engrossing, sad, wry, witty, painful, challenging, quotable, couldn't put down.<br /><br />I think that says it all but this sentence fulfills the 20-word requirement.
B00005TQKQ|2.0|Case was cracked when it arrived, and it did not work or solve the problem that I needed it for.  Disappointed.  Amazon was great about the return as usual.

B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Steelheart explores an interesting idea: what if people developed super powers but they were all villains?<br /><br />The strength of the book is this idea and Mr. Sanderson's solid world building. Newcago is interesting, and enough hints are dropped about other places in the world to make you curious.<br /><br />The first problem I have with the book is that the designed plot twists were fairly obvious long before they were revealed, making what seemed like intended major impacts on the story fall flat.<br /><br />The second problem specific to people who have read Mr. Sanderson's other works, is that there are way too many echoes between this novel and the Mistborn Series, leaving a nagging feeling throughout the book of 'I've read this before'.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a great book.  A real page turner.  You can definitely see this being made into a movie one day.
