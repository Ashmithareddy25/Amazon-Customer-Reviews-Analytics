B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is all I really need for quick edits of pictures I take from time to time when I am not home.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King bokos but they can be a liitle slow to start and confusing...  This one had me from the beginning!  There weren't too many characters introduced at the beginning as is often an issue, and it's so good!  I havent finished it yet as it is a longer book and I have a newborn, but I've really been enjoying this book!  My mom's not a Stephen King fan, but I'm going to definately recommend to her, as I think she'll really enjoy it also!  It's not quite as far out there as some of his books...
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love the game except I was on a really high level but then in the morning it started me over I really want my old dragonvale back please
030758836X|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author and couldn't put it down. The characters are well portrayed and the end was surprising. Very glad I ordered it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Love this show so much. The quality of the video is really good from Amazon Instant Video. And you can't beat the price.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves this game he is addicted. I love the graphics and if he's happy, then hay bring on Temple 3...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the greatest show I've seen recently. The only thing I don't understand streaming from Amazon is that the episode count does not match the one on PBS
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had been putting off watching the &#34;new&#34; Doctor Who series. But I am so glad I did. It's fun and exciting. It draws you in. You care more for the companions then the Doctor sometimes. Very well written. The adventures on earth in current time and just as exciting as the ones off world.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Yes, most of what is in the book is unbelievable.  I was rolling my eyes a lot of the time.  BUT it is super funny and entertaining.  I loved that the author mixed in historical facts and how Allan was involved in so many major world events.  It was sometimes confusing going back and forth between the different time periods, but overall I really enjoyed the book and looked forward to picking it up to find out what was going to happen next.  I recommend it for a light, entertaining read with a bit of a history lesson thrown in.
B000YABS8E|3.0|Branden Fraiser and Christopher Walken made the movie what it is...kept in a bomb shelter for 35 years, Branden 's character knows no social skills except what he learned from his parents after emerging into the real world...
B0049VZ222|5.0|The zombies aren't the whole story. The. Writing is excellent and you never know who will get killed off. Very unexpected!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Always liked Johnny Depp movies and this is no exception...even as a dark character, a 200 year old vampire, he brings his witty and funny usual self like Captain Jack Sparrow but still as serious and innocent as Edward Scissorshands...
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Very happy with the quality<br />Would like it more if there is more 'behind the scene' documentary but overall would recommend this package
B00005JKDR|5.0|The 3 main characters, Mike, Sully (Kitty) and little girl were all so refreshingly cute in their fight against the evil of the large business conglomerate...
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game. this game brings back memorys from the fair.  i wish i could get on my kindle hd.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Won't let the fact that the behind the scenes scandal brought my &#34;Like Kristen&#34; button down a few notches and my disappointment after the lovely and innocent Isabella Swann affect my rating of this movie...Chris Helmsworth and Charlise Theron did good jobs as the huntsman and the evil queen...a bit of horror added to the real Snow White story but everyone eventually lives happily ever after...
B009186JYI|2.0|I've been a Stones fan for 30+ years, but I found this to be boring. You can see all the best parts in Crossfire Hurricane which is a much better documentary.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Took a bit of getting into - but an excellent read dealing with a sensitive subject. Recommended.  Now keen to read more of her books.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|When I came across this. I decided to give it a try since it's free. I'm glad I did, it is very easy to use and has a lot of options. It shows exactly how much battery you have left, by percentage. It can be set to tell you (literally- it can speak!) when your device reaches any battery level by 5 min. increments (going up or down.) You can set as many as you like.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game filled with adventure and awesome for passing the time-- I love the new  Rio too... that is really nice!!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I love the chase scenes, especially near the end when on motorcycles. Good storyline all the way through. Watched it twice and was riveted to my seat both times.
1451683405|5.0|This book takes on society's most accepted belief and completely debunks it.  It becomes easy to see that freewill isn't anything more than an illusion
0810993139|5.0|Brought book 1 and 2 for my little cousin to pratice his reading because he was behind his classmates.  Now he is on a 4 grade reading level and he's only in the 2nd grade.  So very proud of him and he loved these books.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I watched the original television show, and I found the back stories this movie made for the original characters quite creative.
0810994739|5.0|Brought book 1 and 2 for my little cousin to pratice his reading because he was behind his classmates.  Now he is on a 4 grade reading level and he's only in the 2nd grade.  So very proud of him and he loved these books.
B00005ASGG|5.0|Great great movie.  5 stars for the cast and the movie itself.  Great song also by Gene Pitney.  Just great all around
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a big Nelson DeMille fan and enjoyed this new book so much. He really does his homework as you can visualize what the characters are going through within the story in foreign lands. I hope others would like another John Corey adventure such as this one.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Love this CD.  5 Stars.  Just wondering why we have not heard from him before.  Received the CD when promised and just love it.
1423140605|5.0|This book was totally awesome and it met my expectations,loved it!I can't wait for the next one to come out!Thanks!

B0011UJMK2|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Believable, captivating and suspenseful with a touch of Soviet history.  Beautifully written and an easy read
B007MDB6L0|1.0|Very disappointed for a daughter opening on Christmas Day and it not to work! I will never order again for this person.
B008CLI3TE|4.0|Very good price! One thing: the bottom of the box that the discs came in had a pretty nasty scratch. Fortunately, it was only on the bottom.
B00005JLT5|4.0|I have never been able to watch war movies, waaaay to violent, just didn't like them at all !  This is set in war time, in Europe, That part was necessary, I'm sure, as it was the whole point....what the Adren Brody character went through, and his survival.<br />The music was just amazing, the acting, superb, and, I found myself so caught up in the story line that the violence hardly bothered me.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|I have not read the book yet, but have had it on my wish list for a year. I'm buying it in his memory now in hopes that it will help his family in a small way. His murder last Saturday has me deeply saddened. It is so tragic that he was shot, murdered, by a fellow vet at a shooting range after all he had lived through.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very cute game. Great graphics and easy game play. I like the idea of taking care of your own Dragon. My grandson is six and he really enjoys this game...it is teaching him responsibility. He checks on his dragons every day.
0446581348|5.0|this is the one and only beauty makeup manual you will ever need! it goes through the types of brushes, what to include in your kit, how to apply, etc its a must have for any makeup professionals library!
0316224588|5.0|Reading this was like greeting an old friend!  Rebus is as irrasable as ever.  He does what he thinks is the right thing not the politically correct thing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best family saga I have seen. Great performance, acts and production. With fascination I am watching one episode after other.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|what can i say is WOW.  She has watched it sooo much that i thought i was sonna have to get her another one.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Don't know what it is about this game that makes it so much fun, but it sure is.  Unfortunately, I get a crazy lag after playing the game for awhile that makes the game unplayable on my original Kindle Fire.  It doesn't look like anyone else has this problem and the only thing that fixes it temporarily is a hard reset of the device.  Without this drawback this game is an easy five star and even with the problems I'd recommend it to anyone looking for some quick fun.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I only rate 4 stars because for it to work I deleted it then installed it again. it froze. otherwise its awesome.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is definitely my favorite in the series so far. I really enjoyed it and I am looking forward to reading more of these books.
B00008CMR6|5.0|If you love John Wayne you will love this movie. It has everthing I think of when  I think of John Wayne and a western movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game because you can have high scores also because I get power ups and beat people from Facebook
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This game is fun, but gets real irritating real fast. There are only a certain amount of words, so you end up using the same ones again and again. Then, if the game detects you have drawn it before, it comes up with a message telling you that you are playing on more than one device, which you are not. Besides that, it is very poorly monitored as some people just write the word they are supposed to draw, and if you write back in the comments, 'no words please', the next picture that comes your way is another group of words, only this time they are cussing you out. I don't need abuse from a game.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|This is my third book from Grisham and the best grisham novel I have read till now. A really good storyline and a smart protagonist character. So go for it!
B0013F1D02|5.0|I love this movie.  The story is epic, the adventure is bountiful and the characters are intriguing.  Have watched it many times and will continue to do so.  Also, the music is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever because it is kinda like temple run, but in this  game there is someone chasing u and u earn coins which is money in the game and with the money u can buy characters, then there are mystery boxes that u have to use to unlock characters u can't buy with money. So this  is the best game ever download now!!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Easy access to the books you want and fast downloading and synching, overall its jus what I was looking for
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Have read all Michael Connelly novels and wait impatiently for the next novel. He is a great author<br />Mulholland as a short story was very good.<br />/
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game so much however while I'm playing the game freezes up and I've asked around. It happens to my friends as well, I'd like it to not do that because it makes me die. Other than that it's amazingly fun and maybe even a little addicting.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I follow the tv series so I was interested in seeing if the books could be good as well. I was picturing Stana and Nathan as I was reading and it made it that much better. Not a long book but a good read nonetheless.
B00006DEFA|4.0|Wolfgang  Amadeus Motzart sufferd from brillance, oft times brillant people seem to be very strange. Keep this in mind. Just think, to be able to see an entire score in your head. All instruments, vocals etc.<br />was<br /> socially inept, loved the ladies and drink.now enter Soleri a rival  composer, who pretended to take him under his wing , be his friend. It is interesting what a person can and will do because of jealousy , envy ,resentment and down right hate.this film is worth watching more than once. Tom.Hulce and F.Murray Abraham turn this into.a tour de force, bravo!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the book that hooked me.  Again it was the story line that grabbed me, I found I just wanted to know more about Christian
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Love the power and control of her voice.  She is a great artist.  May have to another album of hers
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I found it to be more of a sad and happy love story than erotic.  Of course I ended up falling for the imaginary Christian Grey.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Twist and turns in the plot kept the cute story interesting. Loved it from start to end.  It was a don't stop reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My favorite of the series.  I was glad to see Christian opening up and realizing people do love him and he can love them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story line is really interesting, and the characters are believable and developed well over the period. I would recommend this to anyone.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book gave several sleepless nights. Great plot, great descriptions, great history context. Follett's work is great. Highly recommended. It's very interesting how charachters throughout his books are connected.
B009Y7YC2M|1.0|I got the free app and decided to get the pro version. After paying for it , it won't download, on a brand new kindle hd lte. I will probably have to hassle to get my money back.<br /><br />It keeps trying to revert to the free version. So I deleted that, and adds are still trying to pop-up.<br /><br />Should have read the reviews first.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This a great book!! Really different, you never know what is going to happen next!!  I would recomend it, for a good read!!
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy is as addictive as cocaine (I think since I never did cocaine). Pornography with a story. Don't start unless you plan to finish
B004UID2LC|1.0|After I downloaded it I noticed my Kindle would shut off randomly and while I was trying to watch videos. I deleted this app and it resolved my problem.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I could only play it once. I tried to play it repeatedly but it wouldn't even load!!! worst app ever
B00B99QTM4|5.0|Recently visited Woodstock, IL, the actual site where Groundhog Day was filmed.  Beautiful little town.  This movie asks us to consider how many chances we are given for getting it right.  Day after day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Its so fun! It is also a great time killer. The only thing is when I updated it to the Rio version from the New York version the apps look never changed. By this I mean that when I see the app on my home screen it still looks like the New York version. This is only a little proplem and otherwise the app is awesome. I reccomend it for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its hard at first to turn a little cause you have to swipe harder than on a ipad or iPhone or just smartphone but i like this app but i dont get how you level up so fast
034580404X|5.0|I sat and read this in one day,it was alot of sexual topics but it had a great story line that kept you on the edge through out,it needed another chapter at the end as it was awful choppy.
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|I like the tunes.  Makes ya wanta &#34;groove&#34; some songs and write bad poetry others.  All males so far within listening distance either try to turn it off, change it out, or &#34;be back when that crap has ended&#34;..sheesh! Guys!  What I don't like is that I like these tunes so much I can't sleep for hearing them replayed in my head.. Over and Over..and over within two days of hearing the tunes.
0143119680|5.0|love these types of books keep them coming,keeps your attention throughout the book,easy to read and keep your interest. good job
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My son is amazed by this app. He loves horses and this is the perfect app for him. It is very interactive and fun as well.
1400069289|3.0|Gave  book  as  gift not  sure  what  the  reader  thinks  since i have  not  gotten  back any  feed  back. from him.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|So I gave this Disc to my dad. He didn't watch it until 50 days after I gave it to him, so I can't file a claim now. This is the 2nd disc I've had from Amazon directly that has been defective. It skipped a lot, minutes at a time, then half way through it froze and I couldn't even finish the movie with him. Defective after first use. I looked at the disc and it was scratched and dirty right after opening the box and playing it once. DVD case says Disc was from Mexico. Now I cant even get a return...Never had a 3rd party Disc fail and this was my 10+ Disc.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Just into the first few chapters, but the author puts you in the book with the characters.  It is a very hard book to put down.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Great voices singing priceless songs with incredible emotion. I only wish this was the full soundtrack from the movie. Well worth having until such soundtrack is released.
B000P0J0A6|3.0|I watch this movie today and see that its not as great as I thought it was.. even though its very funny and fun.<br />but from my POV I see a treatise on the socio-economic situation of that particular time that is relevant today.  the protagonists household is a warm and loving one, even though everything is falling apart and nothing seems to work.  they rely on this stuff(material gain) and of cousrse it all seems to bite them in the butt everytime they slam the front door..which is portrayed as the real dysfunctionality of the family unit.  it seems to be saying that we have too much stuff, and too much stuff is what doesnt work.  also, this movie seems to profile certain ethnic persons as being a problem too.  If you notice amongst the ner do well types represented by the gremlins you will find ghetto-blaster totting, break danceing, gremlins mixed right in with the junky gremlins, drunk gremlins, ski masked criminal gremlins, hipster/beat gremlins, and gangster strong-arm gremlins(gremlin, ie Stripe).  Yes folks, these types are portrayed as the gremlins in the social mechanism that makes life a living hell for all us lace curtain mo-foes out there trying to live our lives in peace.  I also have to add this little one in there:  they introduce the break dancing gremlin in a rather homosexual light with the stereotypical PINK leg warmers and all.. and if you notice there is some cross-dressing going on amongst the gremlins as well.  yeah, these are the types that are the monkey-wrenches in the societal machinery.  I dont believe in accidents in films because there is soooo much incredible thought put into every last detail of every scene made in a film(it comes down to financial planning).  Theres also the treatment of the evil heartless bankers and landlords thrown in there for good measure;  \\"mommy im hungry.. yes honey, im hungry too..\\".  Its a veritable smorgasbord of elitist commentary on what they think is wrong with all us little folk.  but wait!  who's going to save us?!..well The college kids of course! The new reich! the new useful idiots(as lenin liked to call them)!  Oh yeah! but also, what kills these horrid wretched gremlins in the system?  light! illumination!  these freeeeks hate the light and illumination of politically correct and double checked mainstream knowledge, because theyre so effed-up and ignorant.  No doubt about it, the illuminated youth movement is our only hope.  HAIL!<br /> so let us not water-down the real problems in our society lest they go unchecked and multiply! Lets not feed our social/mental/spiritual midnight, because thats when all the freaks come out.  Rather, let us combat them with truly ILLUMINATED minds..and kill em all.<br />Its either that or its just a mediocre comedy/monster movie.<br />Dont go taking it too seriously. ;)
B007REV4YI|2.0|This is one of those over-hyped movies. There is not enough action, not enough humor and worst of all the story just does not make sense. The whole movie is 20 minutes too long which made me suffer to get through after a good action-packed beginning. And Sam Mendes is not action director material. Hope next one will be better.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game, would like a way to show rules and what certain notations mean on the game.  Otherwise lots of fun
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an outstanding book. It not only gives you an in depth look at one of the greatest men to ever live but gives you a feeling for the culture of the times. An exceptional read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app on my ipod and it was really laggy I wanted to try it for the kindle and it is awesome!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love this movie and in 3D.  Just like being in the movies.  Great experience and the colors were so true.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book is too long and very depressing, kept waiting for something good to happen, the ending was a huge let down.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Buy this one for the 3D. The movie is an Ok movie, a version very tammed of Indiana Jones.<br />The 3D is just as good as Avatar! The pop up off screen is just as I never seen before on a movie. No flickering no ghosting. Perfcect 3D!<br />If you are a 3D lover is a must have!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I am having no problems with this app.  Th graphics are beautiful, the puzzle pieces rotate and after completing several puzzles all of the pieces were there.  The puzzles fit my kindle fire perfectly.<br />The basic premise is to put puzzles together. The puzzle pieces are dragged from a draw pile on the right hand side of the screen.  You have the option of having the pieces appear in their proper orientation or appear so that they need to be rotated.  You can also place them back into the draw pile.<br />Overall this is s very user friendly app.
B008PWUXQQ|5.0|This is exactly what was advertised. Glad I got it. Seems like it'll last a long time. The very end.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Mothers everywhere can identify with Druckerman. She doesn't claim to be an expert but she expertly goes about uncovering some universally helpful tips for bringing up bebes in any country in an entertaining and conversational way. Wonderfully written!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I read this book in a day and a half. It is moving and has the ring of truth to it. I realize this is a work of fiction but the characters are really well developed.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple calculator does exactly what I need and want it to do. I like that it remembers the last equation that I typed. It has several functions that are not available to me on my phone. Lots of help when your on the go!
031620157X|5.0|I love this book! Chris Colfer did an awesome job on his first book. I could not put the book down.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|While not a quick reader, &#34;I am the Messenger&#34; grabbed my attention and drew me in with a pull that required that I finish the story.  The characters were richly developed as the story unfolded, helping guide the journey to a powerful, thought provoking finish.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|This app really knows how to ruin a good nights sleep. It seems to find the most inopportune times, especially on mornings following heavy drinking. Do not get this app if you enjoy sleeping and not having to do anything with your life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 8 year old loves it super fun he can't stop playing it he thinks it's awesome one of his favorites
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was easy to get sucked into you could feel the emotions of the characters. Easy read wish there was another
B003VS0CX8|5.0|It is amazing to see The Sound of Music in Bluray. Who would have thought...  The special features on the disc are very cool too with fun facts and pictures from the filmmaking process. What a great investment on a classic film.
0596007124|1.0|If you enjoy being treated like a 5 year old, you'll love this book. They take 50 pages of goofy cartoons and scenarios to demonstrate patterns that could be explained in 10 pages. I kept thinking to myself, \\"Get to the point!\\" It's like that windbag professor you had in college who taught to the lowest common denominator of the class.<br /><br />It also would have been nice if they had code examples in languages other than Java. I'd love to see how functional programming could use the patterns.
0143038583|4.0|Good and pretty book about good and ugly stuff. Exposed me to groups of information and inquiry in the thought and action regarding food industry
B004XMMSZG|5.0|I loved the first one so much that I bought an additional one.  Now I use one in my car and another in a Bose unit.  Easy, easy, easy to pair and the product works great!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Just love this movie and the price was perfect!!...very good quality and would recommend this to movie lovers who are romantics  and love Happy Endings!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Must have patience to work and earn things, diamonds, etc. or to make &quot;friends&quot; (no contact info exchanged) to help or be willing to pay real money to have instant gratification.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It's so addicting I sometimes have to force myself to stop playing. I haven't had any problems loading or with game play.
B005OJTVAW|2.0|The folio does not fit the Kindle Fire.  I would have returned it but the person I purchased it for did not want to inconvenience me.  Don't buy it.
B004UID2LC|2.0|when you get alot of music or videos from this app,  it deletes the whole album off your device .. you have to do it all over again. when you do so,  it acts really like a virus. im uninstalling.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Given the quality and depth of RT's back catalogue, the central challenge with any new RT effort is to get fans to listen to and appreciate the new music on its own terms. There may never be another Beeswing or another Mock Tudor (my own personal favorite RT CD), but then neither was Beeswing another Dimming of the Day or Mock Tudor another Shoot Out the Lights. In that vein, Electric is, in my opinion, right up there with the best of RT -- far better than Dream Attic and his most consistent CD since Mock Tudor. What stands out about Electric is, first and foremost, the quality of the songwriting. After just a few listens I find a number of the CD's many memorable melodies competing with one another in my head. Add to that Buddy Miller's production and Stuart Duncan's fiddle, which, as other reviewers have noted, do give a bit of a Nashville feel to many of the songs, and the result is a fresh take on what is still, at its core, classic RT. (The musical distance between Scotland and Nashville is not really all that great.)  Finally, the harmonies sung by Allison Kraus (on one song) and by Sioban Maher Kennedy (on several others) are nice additions as well. RT's singing is underrated, but his sometimes harsh baritone does benefit from female accompaniment (e.g. Linda Thompson, Judith Owen).<br /><br />I expect my favorite songs from Electric will change with repeated listens, but at this point the standouts for me are the more restrained numbers: Another Small Thing in Her Favour, The Snow Goose, and Saving the Good Stuff for You in particular. I would add that the outtakes from the Electric sessions that appear on the bonus CD are, as a group, as strong as the songs on the CD proper. So the deluxe CD is definitely worth the extra cash.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will not be sorry purchasing this season of Downton Abby.  Shirly Maclain guest stars and is so funny as the American.  This show was SHOCKING this year.  I believe you will love it.
0393064476|5.0|I love books that open a period of history that has not been touched as if a key that opened a door.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  I could not put it down.  The twists keep you trying to figure out what is going to happen next and to try to put the puzzle together.  Highly Recommend!!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|This was a good movies for adults. Had good action and good actors. Salma was really good in her role.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|The story took me to a place I was not expecting, a very good book except that it has a lot of blood and guts, if you like that kind of stuff.
0670026603|4.0|This novel generated quite the buzz in the English press and was described as a &#34;love story&#34;. I'm not a fan of romantic fiction per se so I approached the book with some trepidation and was pleasantly surprised.Well written with well rounded characters. Won't be long before Hollywood comes knocking.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I originally read this, and the rest of Clavell's Asian series, when they were first published, over 30 years ago.  Same old crap: CANNOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN!  I fully intend on reading (rereading) the rest of his Asian series.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Couldn't put it down! Hope there is more to come! This book is totally worth reading all over again!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Incredible effects, Ridley Scott is great.  Prequel to the Alien movies. My wife and her sisters go nuts over it, seen it at least 6 times and still as good as the first time.

B005IQZB14|5.0|I have just loved this book.  It caught me and has kept me interested.  About a lot more than hiking
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|HEY!  This book rocks and here's why:  I have TONS of bilingual friends and lots of friends raising their kids to be bilingual.  But I always thought perfect bilinguals just happen naturally to any family living with parents who speak two languages to their kids.  Thanks to BE BILINGUAL, I now know that a) the aim should not be to raise perfect bilinguals and b) anyways, there is no such thing as a perfect bilingual and any level of bilingualism does not just naturally happen.<br /><br />This book told me that I, as an English-speaking parent in a non-English speaking country, need to step up my language involvement with my kid.  Forget Mother-tongue, forget perfect bilingualism.  The language of the country where you live (except in very rare situations) will be the majority language and English will be the minority language that needs to be cultivated and tended like roses in a hostile environment.  And now, thanks to BE BILINGUAL,  we are doing just that.<br /><br />THANK YOU BE BILINGUAL!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|His game is so fun and awesome!!!!It's let's you do every thing...you can groom your horse,feed,and care for it to its every thing I want in a game...GREAT GRAPHICS TO!!!!

B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Romantic comedies have been done so much, and using the same, typical formulaic story that frankly, I had been wondering if there was anything left in the tank.  I like romantic comedies, but in recent years, they haven't offered much.<br /><br />We all know the formula.  Boy meets girl or girl meets boy.  Usually, they click right off, or it is one of those typical \\"worship\\" comedies where one of them dreams of being with the other, and it takes most of the film for them to get together.  If they click right off, then they start off well until some kind of conflict arises that threatens to put the relationship in jeopardy.  Of course, in the end of either scenario, things work out.  Sometimes, great exaggeration is used in the \\"working out\\" process.  It's ironic how much people view romantic scenarios like a movie.  And why not?  Things always work out in the movies, right?<br /><br />Two things make this film work better than your typical romantic comedy: the actors and the story.  Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are very believable in their respective roles as Dylan and Jamie.  Sure, they are both coming off of relationships that didn't work out, they meet in NYC, and before you know it, they click.  The irony here, is that neither of them is looking for anything romantic.  So, we can dispense with the typical \\"wooing\\" stage of the formula.  Despite the fact that we all know that they will end up together in the end doesn't matter as much because the journey is interesting.  Both are playing real people to the extent that neither is demonstrating that they are somehow better than anyone else.  In other words, they could be anyone.  Both of them know that neither one of them is perfect, and frankly, neither one is striving to be.  They come with baggage as does anyone with their relationship and personal history.<br /><br />There are some aspects of the story that we can easily say, \\"okay, seen it a million times already.\\"  However, these are two characters who are very real, and I think one of the things that endeared me to both of them is that neither one is trying at all to be someone they are not.  The only movie that I can think of where this was done so well was \\"When Harry Met Sally,\\" which for my money, is still the best romantic comedy done in the last 30 years.<br /><br />Now, the story is interesting as it takes an idea that I am sure many people have either tried to do themselves or have wondered about.  Can two people have a sexual relationship without any kind of emotional attachment?  It is funny that the gay man in Dylan's life (wonderfully played by Woody Harrelson) and the dysfunctional mother in Jamie's life (equally impressive by Patricia Clarkson) in a sense let Dylan and Jamie know that it really isn't possible.  Of course, we know that at some point, one of the characters is going to \\"fall for\\" the other.  What makes the story work as that we see BOTH characters fall for each other at relatively the same time rather than one pursue the other until the other finally comes around from some kind of epic point of realization.<br /><br />Dylan knows he loves Jamie, even if he doesn't say it, and it's clear that Jamie loves Dylan as well.  The conflict comes into play when both characters are trying to admit it, not only to each other, but also to themselves.  Everyone can relate, to some degree, with two characters who love each other but are afraid to say it.  Sound familiar?  This happens on practically a daily basis.  Isn't it ironic how petrified we become to say three words to someone: I love you.<br /><br />Michael Landon may have expressed this  best when he said, \\"You know we have a lot of funny notions born inside of us. The funniest is that we're supposed to hide the way we feel about people. Let me tell you, everybody wants to know that they are loved, or needed, or cared about. Anybody who doesn't want to know that has something wrong with them.\\"<br /><br />Now, the challenge of a film like this is how to end it.  How to come up with a type of emotionally satisfying climax that works and also hasn't been done several hundred times already.  The climax is satisfactory.  It does work, even if it is fairly typical.  This was the only part of the film that I was hoping might be different.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for another romantic comedy to watch, and you have almost given up on the entire genre, like I practically did, then you can be glad that there is at least one more that is definitely worth watching.  Timberlake and Kunis have the chemistry that really helps to make this film work.  The comedic part of the film works too as neither character is \\"trying\\" to be funny, but instead we find the humor in real, every-day life situations.s is how to end it.

B0054X3FQO|3.0|Don't expect anything too deep or mind challenging though. I enjoyed reading it- very light and pleasant. Good read for a holiday.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|An awesome app one of my favorites! It's like it is a real horse! Another reason I love this great app is because it is really fun and I can play on it for hours at a time!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read like all of Nicholas Sparks books.  Hope the movie is not a let down since when you read a book the movies always leave something to be desired
B003TSEL7S|5.0|One of the best books I ever read!!! It is like Harry potter. If you like magic and miths this is the book for you.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|O....M...G...!!! I love this game. I was instantly hooked on it. It's sort of like Mahjong but easier. The fact that the cube is 3D is very nice. You can rotate it any way. So easy to play on a Kindle. It's not so easy that it's boring but not so hard that you get tired of it. The &#34;attack&#34; mode is a little more difficult but still fun. Best .99 I ever spent. LOL! To who ever made this game I say GREAT JOB!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is a great game  that you will love to play over and over again. You will love its challenge and hardness
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades Darker (I was an idiot for buying it after reading Fifty Shades of Grey) but anyway.  After reading through part of the book I realized it was just a continuation of the same old stuff in Grey.  Here's the plot in Fifty Shades of Grey:  a cute college senior meets a gazillionaire.  It turns out he is a BDSM pervert.  He beats the crap  out of at the end of the book and she leaves him.  Last scene she is crying.  In Darker they get back together and start up again.  There, you know what the books are about so you don't have to waste your time reading them and your money buying them.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I've read this book so many time, it's one of those classic books that no matter how many times you read it, it just keeps getting better.

B00AFEYEUI|5.0|I won't refer to the songs since so much has already been written about them. This edition of Blood On The Tracks does sound really exceptional. Although pricey it is certainly worth every extra dollar!
B000001ELR|5.0|thi is  one major record of kiss i love your songs  they are legacy in rock and roll the best
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|Only a few funny parts. I wouldn't waste my time to watching it again. Even for free. Save your money.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Game is great. Neat game with cool physics which makes you change your game play style per level. There were some levels that made me want to rage quit. I did find some awesome videos that walked me through the insane levels at [...] I look forward to world of goo 2 if it ever comes out. Oh and this game is great for people of all ages!

1609611543|5.0|Great book. Learned a lot from it.It was a little to long and wordier then it needed to be, but a sound idea, I think.
0064409422|5.0|What to say about this book?  It's an all-time favorite of mine, and one that I return to frequently for its resonant beauty and depth.  This particular edition is lovely, with beautiful illustrations that enhance the reading immensely.  Perhaps the countless copies I've bought for friends & family is further testament to the splendor of this little story, a must-read for all ages!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Really liked the case cover for my Kindle, it works great! I think it is not going to hold up as long as I would like it too from this type of material thought. I'll have to buy another one of different, stronger and stiffer materials.
0064430227|5.0|This is a fantastic book, so great for developing a child's imagination, and a must-have classic for any youth's library!
B00A757EFW|1.0|didn't care for the game after all, used to be fun a long time ago. Sorry. But I'm sure it would be fun for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|the reason I put three stars is because it kept freezing up on me so I had to delete it and start over
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A lot of fun! Really like the 3d type look. Would recommend it to anyone. Glad I got it for me.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|This is a nicer case than it appears from the Amazon photos. The pebbled pleather is sturdy and attractive, and feels good to touch. My case is black with grey stitching, and has a dark grey, slightly fuzzy microfiber interior. A dark grey elastic strap holds the cover closed.<br /><br />The padding is reasonably thick (it's puffier than quite a few other cases by Belkin and Verso), and the stitching is well done. The inside four corners have microfiber and elastic panels to hold the Kindle in securely.<br /><br />The elastic readily holds the case shut. I found I can turn the cover completely backwards and slip my hand through the elastic to hold the case with comfort while reading.<br /><br />There are no pockets, magnets, latches or zippers. Also, this isn't a stand-up case. This is a basic case for reading, scratch protection, and mild drops onto soft surfaces.<br /><br />The case holds the Kindle Fire HD 7\\", and also the Kindle Keyboard (Kindle 3). Honestly, any 7\\" tablet can go in it.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br /><br />This is a very basic case, but still a good one for using in the house, office, around town, or while commuting. It's not rugged enough for traveling, but seems plenty durable for normal daily use. For the price point, it's a worthwhile cover, with a clean, minimalist appeal.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Modern world history &  The last hundred year- the value of an individual in the twentieth century- all captured in a story you can not put down.  A well told story that makes you wish to reach the century mark enjoying all that HE has given you to look back on with a smile when you go! :&#62;) KHIM MK
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Not too shabby considering the controls and realization that are there.  I especially love the control surfaces reacting to input and the feel of the controls.  I only wish it had more missions...
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm a big fan of all Nicholas Sparks books. Safe Haven is a great story about finding love in even the most unexpected places. It's a great book & I'm looking forward to the movie.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|I actually liked the game, but after awhile it just became the same thing over and over, but applied differently.  Granted, that's typical for all games, but there was nothing that made me want to keep playing it, or have any desire to keep it.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I really liked this book!  Not at all what I was expecting.  Definitely a good read!  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B008KE3960|3.0|Fun game, but doesn't really make me want to go back and play it after awhile.  Pretty much the same as the classic 1942, just from a different perspective.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Great adaptation of the graphic novel. Well done and a lot of fun to watch. Highly recommended to all Batman fans.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|i love breaking dawn!!!! and no matter if its 8 minutes or 5 minutes longer! im sooooo happy that there is still more of the saga to expirience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D<br /><br />~from a true twiliter/twihard/twi-fan/twilight obsesser
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing ending!  Beautiful love story! This book has so much detail that you feel like you are living through everything.. highly recommended
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|love this movie glad i got the dvd and blu-ray not everybody has blu-ray so if they want to borrow it, we are good to go
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Excellent plan for the USA's economic future through sustained rational analysis in a plainspoken, energetic, even humorous presentation.  The recession is hurting our long term interests and our society maliciously, and it should be stopped aggressively and now.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Great Quality! no problems at all playing it on my PS3. Not a fan of buying Collector's edition, price is great.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|So far this is good time management game and I am enjoying it,it's easy to use without a mouse that I'm used to
B007THA4FI|3.0|If it wasn’t for pure determination to finish this novel, for within the first 100 pages I fell asleep every time I picked it up, I may have put this one down and never picked it back up. That determination came from the name on the front cover. I am extremely disappointed in my lack of praise of this novel for I had been enthusiastic about it leading up to its release. The main problem was that with the introduction of so many characters it took a long time to become engulfed in the story (perhaps a map of all the characters at the beginning or end may have helped). The use of overt sexual references felt pretentious, like Rowling was trying to distance herself intentionally from her previous audience without adding much to the story. Like Rowling is so good at, she wound the web between the characters brilliantly, but her need to prove that she is not a “one-trick-pony” backfired. One of my biggest disappointments is that she wasted time working on this novel when she could have brought us another classic from the world of Harry Potter. I wasn't looking for Magic in the novel, but I was expecting the Magical way in which Rowling writes. There were moments when I detected her voice, but mostly, I just was itching to finish and get to the next novel. I am so discouraged by &#34;The Casual Vacancy&#34; that I won't be reading another Rowling work that is not HP based on her name alone.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Unlike the first book which seemed to me to be written with the intention and the ability to stand on its own. This book was obviously written to be part of a trilogy, and does a great job connecting the first book to the series which I wasn’t expecting to happen. It also contains many great characters, one of which is I am now particularly attached too; Zane, who says something that could easily be quoted and treated as wisdom. Over all this is a great continuation of the mist born trilogy that will leave you craving the final book.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This novel soared towards the top of my favorite novels list with ease. It's been a very long time since I laughed out loud and teared up in one novel. The format of writing letters I saw in reviews bothered some. I haven't read a novel with this kind of format before, and found it wonderful. I loved hearing from so many different views and piecing the story together from all the correspondence and observations. Also after just finishing Kate Morton's &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; before reading about my new friends in Guernsey, I learned so much and had a much broader insight into World War II. I don't think I can properly express how grateful I am to have come across this novel.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|Mostly useful during steam sales, when you know you need to keep an eye on the sales. It also allows you to chat with your steam friends when away from a keyboard, which is nice.  It has both the benefits of valves steam and the down sides, it’s a little intrusive, doesn’t want to leave you alone. Oh, and it has really cheap video games at times.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I don't want to give anything away so I'll stray from specifics. I enjoyed reading &#34;Gone Girl&#34; because of the insight it offered into various types of relationships. I was pleasantly surprised that when the twists and turns came I was thrown off course, even when I anticipated a change in the story coming. I thought the novel was easy to read but it wasn't my favorite. I was disappointed with the ending and wished the author took it in a different direction.
B00683JK9K|2.0|They should mention the adobe air requirements befor hand. Many people refuse to install adobe air. Given adobes past record this is reason enough to not try thus game.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This novel is true magic. Woven with natural twists and turns and beautifully depicted. At night when I read I felt like a small child hearing portions of a bedtime story. And this isn't the first time I've felt this way by a Kate Morton novel, &#34;The Forgotten Garden&#34; was just as magical and enjoyable. There were times when I was left on the edge of my seat and every time I thought I had the story figured out it went in another direction completely. Wonderful, wonderful read.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|when I first got the app it was awsome. i love playing temple run on my kindle fire... but then it started lagging, and crashing, now it won't even open!  fix it PLEASE!!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Definitely worth installing.options allow one to monitor battery levels as well as other functions of the kindle. A glance at the display shows how much power is available for specific functions such as video playback,browsing,and even specific app uses such as Skype or a flashlight app i installed. The only improvement I would have hoped for would be a power percentage read out directly alongside the battery icon on the kindle display. I highly recommend this app!
B00005JL78|1.0|The bonus disc will play immediately, but the feature movie disc won't play at all.  I didn't realize this until I couldn't return it.  What a waste.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game it is nice. Here are some words describing it lovely wow nice awesome  good  love it. Yeah
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Never worked right on my phone and caused youtube to start freezing up plus had advertisements in the way. I uninstalled 2 days after I got it and the only reason I waited that long was to make sure it was the app and not my phone acting crazy.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is absolutely beautiful! The songs are catchy and the quality is great. I highly recommend this for any fan of musicals or good music :)
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This app locked up my kindle every time I tried to use it, would not recommend!<br />Use another app! Look at bing or Yahoo!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is my first Adele CD.  I heard this voice on the radio and just had to find out who it belonged to.  Really good CD.  Every cut is good.  This young lady has a rare gift.
B007EECSFA|5.0|She's done it again, but this time the ending will make the entire book an &#34;aha&#34; moment! But don't cheat & read the end first! It's too delicious!
B009AMALGM|1.0|I thought 1,2,3 where great #4 is an absolute joke. Movie drug on and on and on and on. I'm sending this one back. I would'nt spend $4.00 to rent it, little own $16.00 to own it.
B007REV4YI|3.0|I am a very good judge of movies, and this is a solid 3 star movie. I was very disappointed when I saw this in IMAX. Overrated! One of the most disappointing Bond movies ever! With all the great writers, special effects and camera technology these days. Worth watching once rent it. Again, Overrated!
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Safe haven was a good book. It was exciting and romantic. I am anxiously awaiting the movie to come out.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a good book! I couldn't put it down. I fell in love with the characters and was very sad when it ended.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Elegantly written, painstakingly researched, brilliantly presented. This is the book that would make the most reluctant history student salivate for more. dnf
B007BVMVDU|4.0|I read all of the books that are quite extensive. The series does a good job of summarizing the story in the writings.
0316069434|5.0|Love Michael Connelly and  Harry Bosch. I have read all of the Michael Connelly novels. Keep writing and I will keep reading
B005NQ94LM|5.0|This is one of the best and my top favorite love story around. It is just amazing in so many ways. The journey Emma and Dex go through is very complicated, but original. Some comments talk about not feeling the chemistry, or that you don't know what has happened each year following the day they met, I think that is one of the best advantages of the movie is it really pushes you to use your imagination. Even if you have no imagination it hits on the highlights or their lives, marriage, death, jobs, relationships, good times, and hard times. If Emma and Dex started dating after they met, the relationship would have failed fast. It is epic that they become an item much later in life when it was right for both of them.
0452286751|5.0|I read a lot and Ayn Rand brought the characters & story to life as I have never read. I couldn't believe the book was written so many years ago. I was actually buying Atlas Shrugged & saw this book was written by Ayn Rand also & written before Atlas Shrugged so I thought by chance it might be good also. It really is an awesome read. Highly recommend.

1609611543|2.0|The information I was looking for wasn't addressed until the end of the book. The first 3/4 of the book are redundant--too many stories and a lot of info that wasn't referenced or citations provided. I wouldn't waste my money on it--use the library copy

B0009MAP9A|5.0|I would definitely call this one of the greatest albums of the 60's and even all time!  Unlike his predecessor &#34;Freewheelin'&#34;, all of these songs have a serious tone to them, most telling stories of love, tragedy, hard times, etc.  I would consider all of these songs masterpieces - my favorites being &#34;North Country Blues&#34;, &#34;Ballad Of Hollis Brown&#34;, &#34;Boots Of Spanish Leather&#34;, &#34;When The Ship Comes In&#34; and of course the title track!!  This is just Bob with his guitar, harmonica, great singing voice (yep - I think he's the best singer ever), and some of the best songwriting in the history of recorded music!  Bob has favored most of these songs throughout his illustrious career - he performed &#34;Restless Farewell&#34; at the Frank Sinatra tribute in 1986 and &#34;Ballad Of Hollis Brown&#34; at Farm-Aid in the mid-80's.  Johnny Cash took a liking to &#34;One Too Many Mornings&#34; and sang it with Waylon Jennings in their &#34;Heroes&#34; album in 1990.  &#34;With God On Our Side&#34; became an anti-war anthem while &#34;Only A Pawn In Their Game&#34; was another champion song for the civil rights movement during the mid-sixties!  I always call this my official album of the Fall season since I seem to always have this in my ears on a chilly October evening!  The music seems to fit the mood for that time of year! So of course I recommend this to any casual Dylan fan or any fan of folk (or rock) music in general!  Also, the audio remastering is great on this!  Sounds like Bob is in the room singing to directly you!  Footnote: There's a treasure-trove of outtakes from this album that are also off the chain!!  &#34;Moonshiner&#34;, &#34;Seven Curses&#34;, &#34;Eternal Circle&#34;, &#34;Only A Hobo&#34;, &#34;Suze (The Cough Song)&#34; can be found on Bootleg Series 1 & 2 while &#34;Percy's Song&#34; & &#34;Lay Down Your Weary Tune&#34; are on &#34;Biograph&#34; and also the &#34;Side-Tracks&#34; collection.  Live versions of most ofthese songs are available on the &#34;Live At Carnigie Hall&#34; concert from 1963 and on Bootleg Series 6 (The Halloween Concert At Philharmonic Hall).

1451627297|5.0|SPOILER ALERT: DISCUSSES KEY PLOT POINTS<br /><br />In The Dead Zone, Stephen King posed the familiar three o'clock in the morning question about what someone should do if given the opportunity to kill Hitler before he came to power.  There, psychic Johnny Smith must decide whether he should assassinate senate candidate (and ersatz Hitler) Greg Stillson, thus changing the apocalyptic future he has foreseen.  In 11/22/63, he poses a similar question, but this time gives his protagonist, Jake Epping, a man who exists in 2011 Maine, the chance to change the past.  Jake, you see, has the opportunity to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating President John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />Time travel books are often the source of headaches.  Very few are as well conceived as classics like Matheson's Bid Time Return (a.k.a.  Somewhere in Time), Jack Finney's Time and Again, or Lewis Shiner's Glimpses.  Then there are the inherent time anomalies involved, which many resent because they just get in the way of telling a good yarn.  But, as with its predecessor, Under the Dome, 11/22/63 is a fine book, once you accept its premise.<br /><br />And it's a doozy.  Thirty five year old English teacher Epping is introduced to what might be classified as one of King's \\"thinnys,\\" a break in the fabric of one reality which permits those who utilize them to enter another reality, in this case Lisbon Falls, Maine, as it existed on September 9, 1958, at 11:58 a.m.  Al Templeton, the dying man who introduces Jake to this anomaly, has already done some research, discovering that actions taken after passing through that door do indeed affect the future.  He also knows that everything resets to \\"normal\\" once one passes back through to modern day, and subsequently re-enters.<br /><br />Jake's first experiment with altering time brings him to Derry, Maine, one of King's favorite locales (IT fans will be cheered to hear that Jake interacts with Richie Tozier and Beverly Marsh).  He goes there to prevent the personal apocalypse of Harry Dunning, one of his GED prep students, who broke Epping's heart with a gut wrenching essay that centered on the tragic events of October 31, 1958, where, as a boy, Harry lost his entire family.  It's on that night that Jake first learns some of the trickier ins and outs of time travel, unwritten rules which will have a profound effect on his existence in the world of 1958 to 1963.  These rules, which Epping discusses in terms of \\"harmonics,\\" \\"echoes,\\" and through analogies to the famous \\"butterfly effect,\\" all boil down to one basic tenet:  history wants to follow a certain path, indeed actively strives to do so, so interfering in essentially preordained events can result in horrible consequences.<br /><br />Despite this foretaste of disaster, Jake, now an experienced time traveler who thinks he can handle its pitfalls, decides to pursue the goal Al Templeton was unable to, namely preventing JFK's untimely demise.  Traveling under the name of George Amberson (a nod to Booth Tarkington?), King does a wonderful job of describing a man out of time, evoking his wonder at the smells, tastes, and sensations of another time, touching on the advantages and disadvantages of each era.  Jake establishes himself as a teacher in 1958 Maine, supplementing his income with strategic wagers on sporting events (later, this practice provides a grim example of the inflexibility of history).<br /><br />Eventually, he moves to Texas to actively pursue his goal. He spends his time shadowing Lee Harvey Oswald, in order to assure himself that the assassin was in fact acting alone.  He has to be careful, both not to influence events, or to reveal that he is a man living in another time.  To complicate matters, he falls in love with Sadie Dunhill, the local librarian, who proves to be his soul mate.  Although she's troubled by his strangeness and secrecy, Sadie returns his love.<br /><br />King reveals the substantial research he (and pal Russ Dorr) havedone on the era in general and the Kennedy assassination in particular as November 22, 1963 draws near, describing the day to day life of Lee and Marina Oswald, and spotlighting figures in their orbit, like geologist George de Mohrenschildt.  The fated day arrives, and, the past proving to be \\"obdurate,\\" tragedy ensues, but not of a nature you might expect.  And, history having been changed, an alternate timeline springs into existence.  Having the ability to hit the reset button by re-entering his native timeline, Jake has to decide whether he can live with the consequences of his actions.  His decision, while considered, unselfish and mature, is heartbreaking.<br /><br />11/22/63 is a big book, but one which is quickly and avidly consumed.  It feels very personal to King--started before the publication of his breakout novel Carrie, it is in effect a time machine for the author, a link between his salad days and his later success.  King takes his gift for creating relatable characters to new heights, providing the perfect tragic hero in Jake, and complementing him with a suitable mate, the indomitable Sadie.  Even the smallest of supporting characters spring to vivid life, their very presence advancing an already compelling, textured tale.  King writes with verve and pathos, effectively combining what is at its heart a (forgive this) timeless romance with an edge-of-your-seat thriller, as the countdown towards that fateful day in Dallas proceeds.done on the era in general and the Kennedy assassination in particular as November 22, 1963 draws near, describing the day to day life of Lee and Marina Oswald, and spotlighting figures in their orbit, like geologist George de Mohrenschildt.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Overall, this game rocks! It's a lot of fun to play, it just gets frustrating when it lags or does other obnoxious things like: runner remaining in cart after out of mine, not coming out of a boost and returning to normal speed, not reading a tilt/turn/jump correctly all resulting in death. It I'd also showing same objective twice (even after update).<br /><br />Even still, it is an enjoyable game, one of the only ones I like to play as I don't typically download games. It's challenging, simple, and offers fun rewards for doing well.<br /><br />I would love to see a dual feature where you can challenge other players you know to beat your score!

B008N2Z1L0|4.0|After a seven year absence, it was going to be interesting to see what The Wallflowers came up with on their new release. 2005's REBEL, SWEETHEART had pretty much divided fans down the middle, while both of frontman Jakob Dylan's solo efforts (2008's SEEING THINGS and WOMEN + COUNTRY in 2010) met with critical and (to a lesser degree) commercial success.<br />  Well, GLAD ALL OVER sort of follows it's own path...more organic than REBEL, nowhere near as introspective as WOMEN, with only a hint of the acoustic core that anchored THINGS, the band's sixth release is it's own little animal.<br />  This is both a good and a bad thing. Certainly no one can accuse the group of jumping on the hit wagon, trying to follow the likes of Maroon 5, Train and Matchbox Twenty in landing the latest dance/pop hit, be it self-penned or from an outside source.<br />  But there's also an unfocused quality to a lot of the disc that ends up leaving it feeling hollow and uninspired in spots. Also, after the intimate one/two punch of SEEING THINGS and WOMEN + COUNTRY, one can't help but wonder if Dylan is really meant to sing rock...yes, the heart is there, but as things get amped up, it becomes quite clear that his vocals are somewhat limited.<br />  Things start off strongly, with the edgy, almost frantic, \\"Hospital For Sinners.\\" The track just thunders along, powered by a tight arrangement and whip-smart instrumentation (special kudoes to Rami Jaffee's keyboards!). Add a strong lead vocal from Dylan and you have a nice little album opener.<br />  \\"Misfits And Lovers\\" also has a cool groove to it ~ how can you NOT love the handclaps-as-percussion and lines like \\"It's not glass or the wires at our feet/That gets us dancing this way\\" ~ but, after repeated listens, something just seems to be missing. We'll call this one a draw.<br />  There's a dreamy quality to \\"First One In The Car\\" that expertly blends the depth of Dylan's solo work with the band's rock roots. Toss in vivid lyrics (\\"You're changing your clothes in the back seat you slip/From a girl into a woman in less than a minute\\") and you have one of GAO's top tracks.<br />  The same can't be said about \\"Reboot The Mission\\"...if this is supposed to be an homage to The Clash (complete with guest vocals from Mick Jones), it's only partially successful. There's just something calculated and almost phoney about the cut. I gotta say, I think it was a huge mistake releasing this as the first single. Not one of GLAD's better moments.<br />  Far superior is \\"It's A Dream\\"...there's a hypnotic quality to this dark tale that is both captivating and chilling. Strong instrumentation (love the piano!) supports an ominous lead vocal, as Dylan practically spits out foreboding lyrics: \\"I can hear I can hear them chanting in the woods/On their hind legs walking on little swine hooves.\\" Brilliant.<br />  Equally as strong, but for totally different reasons, is \\"Love Is A Country.\\" Relaxed and loose, this mid-tempo rocker lopes along at a vigorous pace. The song could have easily fit on WOMEN + COUNTRY, yet it has an unmistakable Wallflowers vibe to it. Another absolute gem!<br />  There's a new wave energy to \\"Have Mercy On Him Now\\" that is down right infectious. Anchored by Jack Irons' break neck drumming, the instrumentation rolls along, while Dylan's vocal bobs and weaves over and around the lyrics. Add some rowdy backing vocals and you have yet another winner.<br />  There's also a edgy groove to \\"The Devil's Waltz.\\" However, it only partially works this time...the handclaps, Jaffee's manic piano, the almost tribal beat...it all just seems a bit too much. We've heard this song on pretty much every previous Wallflowers album, and to better effect. Gotta call this one a miss.<br />  Unfortunately, I kind of feel the same way about \\"It Won't Be Long (Till We're Not Wrong Anymore\\"). Opening with the great lines \\"You said the words I want to hear/They don't begin with the letter I\\", the song then proceeds to go nowhere. I can't help but wonder what the track would have sounded like if they had just done it as an acoustic ballad. We'll call this one a \\"Could've been\\" miss.<br />  The same can be said about the hit-and-miss \\"Constellation Blues.\\" The lyrics are lovely ~ \\"The angels that used to be guarding our beds/Have all wandered off and left us instead\\" ~ but the arrangement and vocal just don't work for the song. Once again, I just can't help but wonder what a more stripped-down groove would have sounded ~ and felt ~ like.<br />  Things end on a strong note with the shimmering \\"One Set Of Wings.\\" A delicate, yet powerful, arrangement, heartfelt lead vocal and strong lyrics (\\"Don't be secret to me now/Are you roses or burial ground\\") all come together perfectly.<br />  So...is GLAD ALL OVER worth the seven year wait? Overall, I would have to say \\"yes.\\" Granted, there are a couple of things I'd like to see in the future...the group working with a stronger producer (say, T-Bone Burnett), Dylan pushing himself more vocally...but the fact remains....The Wallflowers are a unique rock band, and with fewer and fewer of those around, it's good to have them back.

B008NR8YTQ|2.0|It's pretty good  at times, but just not as good as Jimi. I compare it to the original in my mind and it comes up short. Some songs can be done by other musicians and it adds some new dimension to the song. These are mostly in the style of Hendrix, just missing his intensity and virtuosity. After I listen to a few cuts from this I wanted to go get my Hendrix discs and listen to them.<br /> Maybe sometimes it's the singer, not the song.

1589946634|3.0|I saw a gameplay video of Space Hulk on YouTube and thought it was really cool (the warhammer universe is creative, huge and exciting), so I started looking for the game and found this... a card/deck version of the board game.<br /><br />I got the main set plus 3 expansions (one for more space marines, one for more tyranids and a mission pack). They all serve its purpose. They give a little more richness to the core game. The mechanics are simple (the rules aren't so easy to understand), and the goal of survival seem fun enough. It is, in the begging, then it wears out.<br /><br />The sole purpose of the spacemarines is to survive... you do this by using action cards and rolling one dice, and that is basically it. You do get tense moments when you realized that an event card may have just killed the character you love... but after a couple of runs, it gets dull. Since the price is not that high, you could give it a go... but if what you want is a good co-op game, I would recommend looking at the Lord of the Rings LCG or Marvel Legendary.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|i love the walking dead!!! i cant wait till the new season starts now in feb. it always leaves me wanting to know whats going to happen next. the walking dead is about what would happen if zombies were real....and i love that it shows that zombies arent the only thing you have to worry about, people get crazy and only want to save themselves...i love this show
B0084I9QI2|5.0|One of his best albums.  3 CDs and 1 concert Dvd. I have Thriller and like to have a couple of CDs from a musician so that I have an extended listening set.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|I love this version of Doctor and I love the content in here, but the only setback I had with this release were the lack of teaser previews, WHICH WERE RIGHTFULLY CORRECTED in the Series 6 box set, for the shows.  All of the Who series replicated the episodic nature of the show and it's thrill and fun.  This unfortunately was not.  Instead of the traditional NEXT TIME...  I got a generic large Doctor Who logo coming at the screen.  It wouldn't be that bad if I would receive, at least, the full musical score like the original episodes had in the closing credits.  Disappointed as I was the shows are still cool.  I've checked an episode on Netflix, to see if this format was done like my Blu Ray and surprisingly IT'S NOT!  Scratching my head confused to what version of the discs I have because it's different with minor nitpicks. If it had what I wanted I would have gladly rate it all stars across but without the things I wanted I have to give it 3 out of 5.
B00499DRJO|3.0|i found it became repetitious and skipped over many pages. It was ok. I think there are other books more valuable to me.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|When I got this app I thought it was gonna suck but it woke me up<br />And it's free!!!  @_@
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|An amazing movie worth seeing. While parts can be difficult/uncomfortable, not everything in life is flowers and sunshine. This is 2 hours well spent.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Easily his best book since the notebook, any person could easily see that he wrote a remarkable love story for the world
034580404X|3.0|This book was highly recommended by many of my friends which is why I decided to buy it HOWEVER having read erotic novels in the past, I find it is just another erotic book.  I have only read book 1 so far as I found it boring but my friends assure me that it improves in book 2 and 3.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The DVD box set is a great way to catch up on one of the best TV shows around today (or to re-watch!). Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My 7 year old son got into the LEGOs Star Wars Sets, so bought the full boxed movie set so he could watch all of them as reference to his LEGO sets.  It is a nice boxed set of both trilogies, as well as 2 additional DVD's with extras about the movies.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is one of the best people I have ever seen on tv.  She is inspiring and such a refreshing person.  I watch her show daily. The book was great!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is an easy to use app.  I have found it easy to use, and highly functional.  A quick way to get almost any weather anywhere.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so fun to kill the monsters and mine and craft the.  Need to make a update for it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|So good, that if they don't do movies for parts 2 & 3, they're missing out.  They will do them though.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|My daughter met the guy involoed with the lighting for the movie. So as a gag Christmas stocking stuffer get her this.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Well written, captivating, and a very easy read. The characters are likeable and the storyline is brilliant at times. In my opinion the books aren't all equally strong or compelling, which I suppose is the case with most series, but the overall quality is definitely worth a look.
0525478817|5.0|I read The Fault In Our Stars in one day.<br />I laughed, I cried, it was wonderful.<br />Also, my book was signed!<br />I definitely recommend this book!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable works great and I am very satisfied with it. There isn't a lot one can say about a cable. Twenty words? You gotta be kidding.
B007MC8YLQ|1.0|The promotions were enticing, but the game is just too hard to learn with the limited instructions and tutorials that are provided.  Better examples of how to play are needed.  I'm sorry I purchased this game - its too frustrating to enjoy without better instructions.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Watch this every Christmas.  If you don't, a baby duckling will fall into a gutter in some small town.<br /><br />Actually, this movie is romantic, funny, tearful, and a pleasure to watch every Christmas.  And it saves duck lives.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|This is not as good of an album as Moving pictures, but is a really fun album to revisit. If you ever liked this album try it in 5.1 HI RES PCM on Blu Ray
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Tired this app on a recommendation. Can't put it down! One of the most fun, frustrating, exciting games I've come across in a long time :)
B009E9R2OK|4.0|It isn't bad, but 24/48K can sound better than this - and why 24/48 anyway? Blu Ray Audio can support 24/192 in all 5 channels!<br /><br />This digital release is much cheaper than the vinyl, however, and the show is fantastic.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the 3rd season episodes of this great Masterpiece Classic.  It is nice to have the entire series to review at your own leisure, and over and over as you may desire.  The only problem, is the waiting time for the next season to be available.
B004YJZ5GM|5.0|I am blown away by the quality of this repressing. Very well recorded, transferred, and pressed. This is a show off your audiophile system quality record.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to see so many versions of the Bible--it's quick and easy to use. I truly enjoy it.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|They sorta fall off after a while but i think its because i have texture walls. THey come with little gems too!
B006P0FIGU|1.0|I saw this movie in the theaters on my 21st birthday. For anyone who has seen it, you understand, surely, that that is a tragedy.<br /><br />I don't even know where to begin. The film certainly seemed promising enough. Glitzy steampunk reimaginings - pleasing to the eye. An all-star cast including Matthew McFayden, Christoph Waltz, and Orlando Bloom. A very intriguing trailer.<br /><br />And then they all opened their mouths.<br /><br />The screenplay is a load of tripe, a real piss-poor conglomeration of modern slang and \\"hilarious\\" quips that make me wonder if Alex Litvak and Andrew Davies know what the words \\"hilarious\\" or \\"quip\\" mean. I swear to God, when the word \\"retro\\" came out of Orlando Bloom's mouth, I wanted to poke him in the eye and everyone in the theater who laughed when he said it.<br /><br />As for the rest, I can't EVEN. I'm not trying to *spoil* anything (good God, as if I could spoil a movie this rancid), but not only are we expected to believe that the musketeers are no longer swordsmen, but reincarnated as ninja war machines, the characters are stripped of nearly everything that made them loveable and worth remembering in the first place. They are now flat, dull semblances of their former selves designed merely to look good while prancing around Anderson's admittedly amazing sets and landscapes, spouting crap lines to get cheap laughs. I swear, they only let Aramis remain a priest as a way to somehow set him apart and make him cool, untouchable.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich was just Resident Evil's Alice all dolled up. Christoph Waltz... I don't even know what he was doing in this movie. I like to think he was tricked or it was way awesomer at the start and some crazy contract made him stay through the finish. His character, Cardinal Richelieu, was watered down to the point of meaninglessness. In the end, when his mindnumbingly dull plot to take over the crown was discovered (and thus my pain at having watched such a movie near its end), he does nothing. He's just like, \\"Oh man, I really wanted to be secret King of France, but now that you musketeers have stopped me. Oh well. Maybe next time, guys.\\" And the musketeers look at him and... let him go. BEGIN SCREAMING AT POINTLESSNESS OF ENTIRE MOVIE. Also, apparently people don't die when they fall from airships. Didn't know that. Must log it away for future reference.<br /><br />Another barf inducement: the old boy humor. Ugh, just so nauseating. Yes, make your manservant sleep on the porch so birds poop on him. So hilarious! Make jokes about how hot you are when you, let's be honest, have a dressed-up mullet. So attractive! Put down women, the entire sex of which was only included to be delicious, necklace-stealing, lady-in-waiting eye candy for the bros. Yay!<br /><br />This is where I get even snootier because the worst part of this is that everyone who heard me say that I did not enjoy this film, not at ALL, said (and please say this in your head in a voice as whiny as possible - I sure am), \\"It's Paul W. S. Anderson. What did you expect?\\"<br /><br />Hmm... what did I expect? FOR IT TO SUCK A WHOLE LOT LESS.<br /><br />***I have heard a lot of people blame the existence of this movie on Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. I will say that I love that movie. I will also say that it is a pretty dumb interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. It is a glammed up, tricked out caricature of a much loved character, turning him from a crime-fighting genius into a gutzy, attractive, P.I. ninja/professional wrestler/vessel of all human knowledge. The reason Guy Ritchie got away with it was that it was done WELL. The design is beautiful (also very steampunk), the music is INCREDIBLE, and the dialogue is effing brilliant. It's not hard to forgive the obvious differences when comparing the books to the film because enough of the old Sherlock is preserved. The viewer can be convinced this is a new Sherlock, like the old but reimagined to be as smart, sexy, and funny as they want. Andthat is the big, fat, freaking difference. /endsong
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show because it is a true character piece, focusing on the lives and relationships of all people on the show.  The acting is superb (especially love Maggie Smith!), the writing excellent, and the setting and wardrobe pieces stunning.  Offers a unique glimpse into the lives of early 20th century aristocracy and their staff.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was very nice to read such a book written ... and experienced ... by a medical doctor.  Hope this helps more people realize that death is nothing to fear.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is great for children that like horses. you have to get this app your children will love it
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I would recommend to all. After using this product for a few days i find it is an excellent design.
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I've had these for almost a year now, and I've put them through a lot of abuse. They've been dunked in raging rivers, thrown against rocks, used to hammer nails (and dig them out). Seriously, everything your dad told you NOT to do with your multitool. They're still good as new. I was hesitant to buy something with bear grylls' name on it, just because I thought it would be some celebrity endorsed POS, but after reading reviews here I decided to chance it. Well worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it! So real! I love getting to take care of a horse. I think the training for the competitions is my favorite part of the game.
1616614609|4.0|Very fun game, but the rules are a little hard to understand until you've made a few passes through it. It can be intimidating trying to teach it to people who've never played a CCG before, my wife's eyes glazed over numerous times when I was explaining the rules.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I thought this book was very good I give it 5 stars. I think Ransom Riggs did a great job with the story line. I could honestly say that this book was a great book to start off the new year.
1849904251|5.0|This books has many details of the Sherlock show. It is written  with humor and lots of inside information for any Sherlock fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much !!! I couldn't' put it down ! I stayed up till like 1:00 am. reading this book ,when I usually go to bed at 9:00 pm. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!!!!! THANK YOU SUZANNE COLLINS!!!!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie is a bit slow but does give you a lot of food for thought.<br />Visuals are good and effective
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|In my opinion it didn't work well at all. it was very, very slow. Just took way to long for searches to come up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to pass time. The different cities are nice. However I wish such a large number. Of coins<br />Weren't. Needed for different characters.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Just pure fun with great music!  Debra Messing and Angelica Houston(my favorite) are great.  At the end of a long day just kick back, relax and watch smash.
B009NH6AOQ|1.0|Unfortunately i havent gotten this item. I cant say I recommend this because I havent seen it... I already payed my credit card and its been too long...<br /><br />:(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I thought this was a cute and funny movie, I'd watch it again.<br /><br />I need seven more words so here they are.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|I love Paul Simon, I love this album, and I love the price for the digital download! The sound is great and keeps me groovin' at work.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|My kids are playing this game collaboratively.  They really enjoy it.  I haven't had a chance to try it, but it looks quite engaging.<br /><br />ETA: If your kids are playing this on a Kindle, make sure in-game purchases are disabled in Settings.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Im a huge fan of musical thigns and this movie is just like alot of them, but i liked it alot and got a kick out of it. i was happy wth the actors.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I actually don't play many games, but my kids got a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas, and this game was free.  They enjoy it; a level of play makes a nice reward for finishing a task.  I loathe the music, but they are good about turning the sound off.  Wish other people would train their kids to do so in public spaces.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this is a game that children will enjoy as well as I do, and it teaches how to take care of an animal if you really love that animal!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Is there any other show that can combine strong character development and interest with action, adventure and intrigue? Nope!! Gibbs, the patriarch, and the rest of the brilliant dysfunctional family always give generously to their extended family, the loyal and expecting viewers.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If I had to describe this game in four words it would be, second times the charm! LOVE this game!
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|Like most of this company's games, the way to get the most fun out of this game is to spend real money on gems<br /><br />While it is fun, it is time consuming to make money in the game without buying gems or going sailing often; which in itself is hard, because it is hard to defend your ship without buy A LOT of gems which cost real money. Not worth it to me.<br /><br />Also the game/map is way to zoomed it, making it hard to seem much of your village at one time. This is particularly annoying when on of your crew requests you to find something.<br /><br />I hope the makers will address this with an update soon!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a great book it is probably now one of my favorite I would definitely recommend reading this book to anyone.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|So happy to find something as funny as Will & Grace again :) So glad to have this to look forward to each week!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book didn't find it as good as the first. Kind of jumped around some. Still enjoyed reading it though
0815411839|5.0|This biography is the best one you can read about Marilyn Monroe. Spoto writes based on factual evidence, not on all the rumors about her and gives all of his sources.<br /><br />The actual content is very interesting. I think it's fascinating to get into Marilyn's world and see who she was as a person and not the icon.
B00A31UXLW|5.0|The reason i gave this book 5 stars is that  Michael Connelly yet again delivers a book in which Harry<br />Bosch is at his best. His no nonsense approach as a detective and the great story line which was hard to put down.<br />This was the first book I had read on my new kindle and thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />I hope that down the track Harry's daughter will be in the books as a detective as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good detective novel with a great story line.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Everyone should watch this series to fully understand what the sacrifices our founding fathers made for us. A great gilmps of early America
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|One needs patience when learning to fly - just like a real chopper. ;-)  Quite fun along side Anroid Pool table.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|This movie is certainly not the average and you could watch it multiple times and just realize something you missed the last time you viewed. Say what you will about this movie but no one can deny that Pattinson performed his arse off in this movie. Colin was first cast and couldn't fulfill the obligation to Cronenberg but I say this with extreme confidence. Colin Farrell couldn't have touch Pattinson's performance in this movie. Watch it...not everyone will like it but it is a piece of art with a contemporary message. I hated DeLillo's book finding it unoriginal when you look back at the movie Game 6 with Keaton it has some of the same lines and patterned similar in plot. But I give credit to Cronenberg he pulled off a difficult script and unique in its air. This Eric Packer's world as it is  was defined by the people and professionals around him in his daily life, which begins to crumble and he just seeks and hungers for definitions. Especially since what he thought (his life)  was defined in truth but easily eludes him, he struggles inwardly and outwardly to make sense of his current experience. People, Pattinson playing off Giamatti, a supreme actor, was an exceptional scene. Giamatti was excellent and Pattinson was such a compliment. Binoche was wonderful, however, I didn't like how Cronenberg introduced her into the movie, you cut immediately to she and Pattinson having sex and it seemed to lack flow moving into her intro into the limo and then again maybe that was the only way to do it without subtle entrances. Kevin Durand did an exceptional job and so pulled off his character's interaction with Pattinson, as well as, Gadon. She was a great cast giving such a unique air to her Elise character. This movie will not entertain the shallow thinker. It is definitely is for the viewer who wants his intellect stimulated and entertained at the same time. There is some  sarcastic comical dialogue between Pattinson and Gadon....the peanuts, her mom's tits..who in the hell have seen their mother in laws tits and has complimentary thoughts? Get the movie and pay attention. You will marvel at Pattinson and Giamatti..they should hook up again. Pattinson shows the acting chops of an experience actor and not an actor made by a pop culture. I really believe if he plays his cards right and keep taking roles with a lot reach, he'll be one of the greats. Mission Blacklist is an excellent choice for Pattinson so that he can capture a male audience as well. Well done the entire cast of Cosmopolis!! Well done photography, directorship and producing hands, be proud Cosmopolis was an excellent movie make and deserves more applause than it received, only simply because it stands solo from the average movie that tickles your senses with CGI heroics. Instead the movie offering its viewers something to really consider, that being,  are we as a people living life in our world existing in truth or only in the fallacy of truth which mankind thinks he has created. A fallacy created simply because that is the way it is and has always been simply because of life outcomes that surround us from our experiences and what we impute on the world because those experiences,  which left its mark on the world.  Well done Cronenberg!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I am hooked, mesmerized, and in all respects addicted to this series.  Nothing else on the tube can compare to the consistent over-the-top excitement and magnetic curiosity that is American Horror Story.  The idea of using a repertory company - using the same actors in new stories each season - is a brilliant one.  Having an assembly of great actors and using them in new roles each season produces great performances and good product.  I remember only one other such idea in TV, when I was very young.  Richard Boone (of Paladin fame) gathered a repertory company of fine actors and featured a new story each week with new characters & the same actors.  It was critically acclaimed, but lasted only one season.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of things supernatural & creepy.  I'm also a very huge fan of Jessica Lange, who absolutely outdid herself this year in a role that ran the gamut from sadistic/cruel to sympathetic.  Her &#34;The Name Game&#34; rivals anything I've ever seen on MTV or iTunes and if I didn't already own Season 2 of the series, I would buy &#34;The Name Game&#34; alone as a music video.  What a HOOT!<br /><br />Lastly, Ryan Murphy is the best thing that's happened to TV in many years.  Based on his work that I've seen (Nip/Tuck, Glee, American Horror Story, and The New Normal), I can say that I'm anxiously awaiting his next effort.<br /><br />I would recommend American Horror Story only for adults.  I don't think kids would even be interested in it, but shouldn't watch it until they're old enough to understand its sensations, subtleties and satire.
B00371V6SE|4.0|This was such a sweet, heartwrenching but heartwarming story. I loved Logan's quiet strength. Not speaking for the sake of speaking but taking control when he had to. I loved the way the relationship developed with Logan not pushing Beth at any stage and also the way he and Ben interacted. It was just **sigh** a really good book. Would definitely recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so so amazing it is fun any not to to hard but fun u should get it know I love u will to. :-)<br />  fun love it get it lol
B0091ICDHU|3.0|I bought this book as I read the reviews and was very intrigued. When I read it though I was a bit disapointed. I really liked Layken's character and could appreciate what she had to go through. With Will, I understand why he let her go but it just seemed to easy for him to do it. Maybe I am being to hard on them but I was just expecting a bit more - like maybe a bit more poetry from Laken to express what she were really feling at different points in the book (when she found out about her mother's illness and when Will left her)and not just the end when she went after him.
B00A2LOAKI|1.0|I hate what they are doing to this character.  Enough with the blood and darkness - You are turning my hero into a assassin.  I would never recommended any child to watched this movie.  From blood, transsexuals, hookers and the harsh language this is a for sure a movie to miss.  If I didn't collect the figures, I would have never brought this title. Shame on you for making this  horrible movie.  Batman fighting Superman??  Just STOP!  This is what they put out to be the norm..its not!  Give me the old Batman and BOY Wonder anytime.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|this app sucks no way u know things about things with this app just wants ur cash n&otilde;.... Jane Jens sins snsns sj s s
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is great but it may be a little harder than the last one but it is far more detailed and exciting with lots of great features and areas
B005LAIGRS|5.0|The Safe House DVD was in perfect condition. And plays well. It was definitely worth the price! I Love IT!
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I bought this for my kindle fire.  Great game, fairly easy to learn but still with plenty of depth.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because the videos cause the app to crash.  You can turn off videos in the options.  Game works perfectly fine without the videos.<br /><br />Overall great game - not many board game adaptations available for kindle fire so I'm glad to see this out there.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in one day I just couldn't put it down. It would be been good just as a love story but it was even better as more.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had seen these movies over the years, but you forget how much the characters change as they age. A long weekend snowed in was a perfect opportunity for a marathon. What great storytelling - although the effects in the older movies are already beginning to feel old. How we are spoilt.
B005P1YCNK|4.0|If you have trouble with motivation or getting up and getting started on a life-changing goal or even a small habit, this book gives you steps on defining goals and going after them to become what you want to be!
B005MZIF4Q|5.0|Good,this the only one I have ever fully read and this one is really good. I love this and I think u will
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it is so far the best calculator app I have ever seen. it's simple and it doesn't have a confusing way to use. it if it could only add fractions well
1439102813|5.0|My Book Club decided to read this book and I was not sure if I would like it given the subject matter.  But now I am telling everyone I know to read it.  I really appreciated that it was written from the point of view of Alice herself.  It made me understand much more about how it must be to have this disease.  Everyone should read it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a fun game and you should buy it $6.99 dollars I'm like wow that is cheap so like git it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|One day I messed up my phone @ work..so I had to buy a cheap phone to get me by for the month..anyways my cheap phone didn't have the simplest thing..such as an alarm clock. I browsed through my kindle looking for a simple alarm clock and found this one. I can have multiple times set..which makes it easy for me. Love it! You will too..I guarantee.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It's good to have weather at ones fingertips.<br />Why do you require twelve words?<br />harveyrimrock and miss out on my Harvey milk supply
B0085KGHI6|4.0|Not nearly as much Stones as expected, Muddy was uneven.  I'd pay big $ for video of the time he recorded Long Distance Call with some All Stars for the Fathers & Sons LP from long ago.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It's pretty entertaining.  I love family guy so I enjoyed the prevented random humor the movie has.  It was better than I thought it would be given the premise.
030759565X|5.0|I just received my copy yesterday and every page I turned offered up another beautiful photo accompanied by a recipe that made me want to run to my kitchen and start cooking.  What I love about her recipes is that they inspire me to move outside my comfort zone and try new things, whether it be a new ingredient or just a new way of using what I already have in my kitchen.  For instance, I was thrilled to find the a recipe for Honey & Harissa Farro Salad, mostly because I've had a jar of harissa in my refrigerator for ages and have never known quite what to do with it.  Now I have a recipe! The other thing I love is that her recipes are easily adaptable.  I may not have the exact ingredients called for in my pantry, but I know that I can probably find a suitable substitute and trust that the recipe will still work.<br /><br />I've seen other reviews that complain about the number or variety of recipes included.  Or that they have or have not already appeared on her blog.  All I can say to these folks is that if you are a regular reader of her blog she gave a very specific idea of what would be in the book well before it was available for purchase.  I was quite pleased with the few favorites that I had already seen and I was excited to see new recipes that I know will soon become favorites.  I will admit that I tend to favor savory fare and at first I was bit concerned by of the number of recipes for sweets. However, when I got the book and was able to see exactly what was there I was delighted to find a well rounded selection of cakes and pies and tarts and cookies that I can't wait to make, the first of which will definitely be the Grapefruit Olive Oil Pound Cake.<br /><br />Just a side note to those who have complained about the inclusion of her son, Jacob, in the book.  He is her son and a large part of her inspiration in the kitchen.  Personally, I would have been disappointed if she hadn't included him in the book.
0810993139|5.0|this book was for my grandson and he was very pleased, as he already has all of the other Wimpy Kid books.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence is a more grown-up, if that is the word, sound from these fellows.  I enjoyed it as much as I did any of their other CD's.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|This game is quite relaxing, in both play and background music which can be turned off. Tiles can be matched at leisure, unless three stars is the goal. Even if the timer runs out, it will restart, and two stars are still possible. Tiles can be enlarged by sliding two fingers away from each other on the screen (the opposite of pinching). Slide your finger for a short distance, and the cube will rotate in that direction. If the facing tiles are upside down, the cube will rotate in the opposite direction of your finger slide. Either way, you're in control as to the speed of rotation. Keep holding your finger down, and the cube will keep rotating, which could make you dizzy. All in all, this is a very enjoyable game.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I've been meaning to watch this ever since I saw the trailer about a year ago.  Finally I watched it not knowing anything about it other than that it had high ratings in rottentomatoes and amazon.  WOW!!!  I believe it's much better viewing when you know very little about the story of Rodriguez.  My emotions went on a roller-coaster ride and at times I couldn't believe how much this movie affected me.  By the end I had tears streaming down my face and could not remember a film that made me feel this way.  It's times like these when filmmakers are at their best. Love this film and love the Rodriguez family!
B005KDWUFA|3.0|I am a huge Il Divo fan, but this one doesn't really do it for me.  Some of the songs are okay, but none of them have the breathtaking vocals that I've come to love.  Maybe I just don't like it as much since my favorite singer, Urs, doesn't have much of a part in these songs.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like this app. The blue color is not harsh at 6am, and the alarm (at least the one I've used so far) is not startling. I wake up pretty easy, so this is actually perfect for me.  I haven't tried my own music to wake me up, but will in the near future.  I have to physically open the kindle and press a button to turn it off instead of when I just beat on the alarm clock until it stops. Also, the numbers are real big and easy to read.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This has been the longest story I have read in a long time.  It made me go back to my infancy and those wonderful and trying growing pains.  I also liked the poetry and imagery used and the teachings hidden here and there.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is just a superb book. Very interesting and very well written. Lots of historical information that let's you understand many things in context with the time.  Very much recommend it.
1118109791|5.0|The book is good for me to prepare my GMAT exam. The book arrived my home quickly. I like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Had me hooked from the beginning. This is a book that actually makes you feel. Have seen the movie and the book, both are extremely incredible. It starts out with a girl named Katniss and after her sister being entered into a deathmatch (fight to the death), and as a big sister, she takes her little sister's place in the contest. That is all I can tell you......
0670026603|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a year.  The first book that made me laugh aloud and choke up since The Color Purple 20 years ago.  It is tender, realistic, and beautiful.  The characters evolve, make mistakes, stay on their goals.  We need more novels like this one.
1401322786|4.0|I am still reeling from reading this. I haven't cried actual, real-life, tears while reading a book in such a long time-I was a mess. Heart-strings were pulled, lessons were learned, and as cliche as it sounds, I can honestly say that I've found new meaning to the phrase time is precious. It's such a beautiful thing, what words can do to you, and Mitch Albom is truly a master craftsman with his.<br /><br />Initially, the book alternates in very small chapters between the life and eventual introduction of Father Time (Dor), and the lives of two random citizens, Sarah and Victor-victims of time: one wanting it to speed up, the other wanting it to slow down. The small chapters completely worked for this book, it helped move the story along at a pace more suited to it's lesson. I felt like I was able to take in a lot more this way. The story eventually reaches a collision of sorts, all three characters are within the same time of existence. Dor has been sent to Earth, after spending 6000 years trapped in a cave, his punishment for constantly measuring time-for drinking in the power of this new found phenomena, and thinking of little else. His mission: to help Sarah and Victor-and eventually himself-realize the fault in their decisions, and the consequences that come with wanting to bend time to suit your needs.<br /><br />These characters did not need long-winded back stories, they were you, and they were me. We know ourselves well enough to know that we too, are all such shameful victims of time. We all want more, sometimes we want less, it's never enough to just appreciate the now, soak in the goodness of this very second..yes, this one..and now this one...<br /><br />Yes it's an obvious enough lesson, but how often is it pointed out to us? How often do we actually take it and put it to use in a positive way? This book was a much needed knock upside the head for me. Time slowed down as I read this, and by the end of it I was in tears-for the amazing eventual outcomes of the characters, and for my own realizations.<br /><br />We all need this book. I don't care what genre you read, or how big or little a Mitch Albom fan you are. This book will always be needed. Appreciate the people and moments you have in your life right now, this second. Time is just numbers on a clock.of the characters, and for my own realizations.<br /><br />We all need this book. I don't care what genre you read, or how big or little a Mitch Albom fan you are.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|I would recommend this movie to ANY age. I am over 40 and enjoyed this movie immensely. GREAT FOR ALL AGES
B000002L7R|5.0|I bought this cd for my fiancee who absolutely loves Prince's music!<br />He is extremely happy with it!<br />Thank you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is a very fun game for kids and adults. the only thing I don't like is how you have to get so many things to unlock characters. like 500 spaceships to unlock an alien characters.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|Awesome action packed movie!<br />Love all of the big well known actors in it!<br />Happy to have it to add to my collection.<br />Will definately buy from again!<br />Fast shipping !
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I thought that overall the series was done well and was captivating.<br />I thought that everyone sleeping with everyone was a little much.<br />Hated Jenny and no one in real life would continue to have her as a friend and invite her to social gatherings all the time.<br />I would recommend this series to anyone whom I felt would like to see it.<br />I loved Bette and Tina and wanted them to get it together and not fluctuate all the time.<br />I was disappointed in Kit because clearly she was so straight it wasn't funny but the writer wanted us to think that she wanted to dabble in the other side...didn't come across too well so it was annoying me. Every straight person is not interested in the same sex team (although some are).
0670022705|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my wife at Christmas.  She is fascinated with it!  I'll be reading it next!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Rebus might be getting older but he's still amazing. This novel reads as well as Rankin's earlier Rebus novels. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommended.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven intrigued and fascinated me from the very first word.  It certainly a positive look into the afterlife, if there is one.  And after reading this, I believe something good lies up ahead.
B005PK553C|5.0|Just like you can't put a good book down, I could not stop watching American Horror Story Season 1.  I was on the edge of my seat throughout!  Watched all 12 episodes in less than a day!  Hoping season 2 will be just as good....looking forward to it!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I bought this for my gma b/c I knew she would love it. My 4 year old daughter loves this movie and always asks to watch it. It is one of my faves too. It's good for the whole family!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Recommend for 7 and up. Beautiful friendship story, great strong characters.  I will read again for sure. I'm sure you will like them also.
B0000714BP|5.0|I bought this for my gma for xmas (yeah she's a cool gma). I loved this movie when I saw it as a kid (yes, I loved transgender movies as a child, so what, Rocky Horror anyone?) and I knew my gma would love it b/c her favorite movie is The Birdcage. I was right. It's a great flick!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|To be honest I found this book to be rather boring and predictable but all in all not a bad read
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have a twofold enjoyment with WOOL.<br />The writing is good. The story is a grabbed and I don't know where he is going with it. The people are captivating and I can get lost in their struggles.<br />The second reason I am so glad I bought the book is I got in early enough to watch the progress to publishing.<br />Thanks to being accepted on Hughes Howie friend list on Facebook it has been a delight to watch his surprise at every turn at how well the book is doing.<br />The book itself is definitely best seller material. Up their with other top authors who wrote Great books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read. Three friends were reading this same book on a recent cruise. We ALL loved it. Keeps your interest all the way through.
034580404X|5.0|It was an amazing book, I loved the sex but I saw a lovely story behind the kinky sex. I enjoyed it very much!
B007UXSKMU|5.0|I enjoy the behind the scenes info like this short preview has.  Although a little scary to watch when he went down the side of building
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and had a hard time putting it down! The SEALS are truly an amazing group of guys and reading about what they do just blows me away.  I would recommend this book.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case didn't last a few months....let alone a &#34;lifetime&#34;!  One drop was all it took to break in pieces!!!  I also purchased an Otter Box Defender Style from a different vendor and it has proven to be more Lifeproof than this case was.  We feel it is a knockoff and are awaiting a reply from the vendor on what type of resolution they will give in this situation.
B003PDQEBS|5.0|this movie has come to have deeper meaning to me than i first expected, the acting was superb by all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this TV series. The plot is amazing; the acting superb. It will keep you on the edge of year seat.
B00004UEDQ|5.0|Received this movie 2 weeks before it was due so kudos on delivery!!!!  Have not had a chance to watch it yet I purchased this for a group of recovering alcoholics, including myself to watch as a group along with Broken Bridges and Country Strong.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting story. I'm glad to have read this book. I enjoyed  how science  and faith collided into this amazing journey.

B009KHBDUU|5.0|Great movie, visually striking and great story telling.  I would definitely recommend it to others who like Tim Burton movies.  I got the same sensation as when watching Edward the Scissorhands.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed Gone Girl because the story line kept surprising me. I couldn't put the book down as I wanted to see what twists and turns would occur next. I did not like the way it ended. I'm a bit of an optimist, therefore hoping that Amy would pay for what she did to her husband. I also think he deserved the &#34;payback&#34;
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this app though I would like to see updates. Do be sure to turn on parental controls if you do not want your littles spending a lot of cash!  Nevertheless a great game for ponies fans.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Love any movies with Russell Crowe.  I had another copy that was not good so I ordered this one and it was awesome.
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|This is the only John Mayer CD I own, so I can't compare it to others, however, I do recommend this CD for some easy listening.  John's words so hit the mark.
0316228532|5.0|Though it's completely different from Harry Potter, I love this book. I couldn't put it down! I'd recommend this to anyone 18+.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|Yummmmm  Great Story - Great Ending - Great Romance - Great FUN!!  I bought 3 copies cuz I lend them out and seem to NEVER get them back!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show so $1.99 per episode was well worth the money. Season 3, so far, is as good as 1 and 2.
B00005JLIU|4.0|Hadn't seen this in ages and it is great fun!  I am required to write ten more words so that what I am doing.

0316069434|4.0|I like all of Michael Connelly's books, especially the Harry Bosch novels, and The Black Box didn't disappoint!  It's definitely a good read!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|This is an amazing if complicated spy story. The viewpoint is of a young single mother who is struggling with finishing her Doctorate at Oxford. When her seemingly daffy mum starts giving her biographical chapters of her (mums) life, her perspective and understanding of her own life start to get twisted. And she gets involved ...<br /><br />I refuse to do spoilers as this story needs to be read to be really appreciated. I got it in Kindle format and it is one of the only books on Kindle which I felt the need to use 3M sticky notes on pages for perspective points and some of the dialogue.<br /><br />I've recommended it to friends who enjoy WW II spy stories - ones which are the small moments which are both life and world changing and create a sense of reality.<br /><br />This is a great read - try it.
0345541588|2.0|This book was very long and boring.  It took forever to get any type of action other than our hero walking around New York, pretending to be a bum, beating up some guys and then doing the same thing over and over.  What a lame scenario. The story and action started in chapter 77.  This was my first Reacher read and I hope the rest are so much better than this.
1616550414|5.0|In so many words, I cannot adequately sing my praises of this amazing book. Featuring reference material, illustrations, development art, and historical timeline connections for the games, this is a fantastic addition to any Legend of Zelda Lover's library.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love how it leaves you on the edge of your seat ever week. I love the characters too! FANTASTIC!
B000ZBUY78|3.0|I bought this watch as a gift for my mom, who is 80.  She loved the look of it, but the numbers/hands were hard to read for her, even though I could see them okay.  However, neither of us could read the day/date at all because it's so small.  I ended up returning the watch because of this.  But if you have really great eyesight, you would probably love the watch because it's very pretty.
B008133MDK|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman seriously two of the best actors on screen today. They are the perfect team and do a wonderful job of bringing this series to life!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My co-workers all kept telling me how great this book is. I started reading and at first was lost. One would never expect the turn of events with all of the twist and turns. Sky and Holder are great together chemistry from the beginning. Great book
B0086213XW|3.0|I took a chance and watched this film late one night mostly because I am a fan of Sarah Polley both as a director and actress but I felt the writing was juvenile, the story simplistic, and the directing mediocre. She had all the right ingredients to make a wonderful film but nothing really meshed. The story was fairly simple.  Michelle Williams played a young woman who meets Luke Kirby on a trip to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia.  They end up in the same plane home to Toronto and then find out they live across the street from one another.  Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful love story but oops, sorry, Michelle's character Margot is already married to Lou, played by Seth Rogan, and expresses that she is still in love with him. Unfortunetly she is very intrigued by Daniel, (Luke Kirby), and thus begins the basis for the entire film; whether she should stay with Lou, who is nice and sweet and safe or try something different and start a relationship with Daniel.  The worst part, for me, was the lack of chemistry between Michelle Williams and her husband as well as her potential lover. I found Luke Kirby very sexy and I just kept wondering what does he see in this childish, neurotic, simplistic young woman other than her looks. She was so needy in a very agitated way that it made me very uncomfortable. I thought Seth Rogan did a suprisingly good job in a role outside his usual comedic genre and Luke Kirby could have been much better if he had been given a better muse and better, more unique dialogue. SPOILER! I found the scene in the cafe where he tells Margot what he would physically like to do to her almost embarassing because it was like he was professing his love and lust to child and not a sexy woman. It is frustrating when a film that has so much potential leaves you so disappointed. I want to give it lower ratings but I gave it 3 stars because I could see there was alot of effort by Polley and the cast but, in the end, it just didn't work for me.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. Very moving story. Highly recommend this book to everyone. Written very well and definitely worth wile to read.
B004UID2LC|4.0|its an awesome app, but the only complaint that I have is that I think its made my kindle fire run a bit slower than it did before.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again Harry Bosch solved a complex case with good old solid police work.  Grit and dogged pursuit of the truth
0307477479|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in quite a while. The plot jumps around a little in the beginning and almost feels like a collection of disjointed stories but in the end they come together beautifully. Her writing is simple yet thought provoking and I found myself completely engrossed in each new character. I didn't think it was hard to keep track of the characters/time line with a little bit of focus.<br /><br />Some reviewers mentioned not being able to see the PowerPoint chapter, which in my opinion is fairly crucial to the whole cohesiveness of the book. I read this on my ipad and had no issues - but if you have a kindle you might want to buy a paper copy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game of its type that i have played it is much better than temple run and is much more enjoyable and addicting than any other game like this. this is the best app i have on my kindle and i would recommend it to anybody!!!
B002YCVX5S|3.0|Not Tarantino's best work.  Christoph Waltz is amazing though- very compelling.  I'm not a fan of Brad Pitt so I hated his role.  This movie was hyped up by a lot of people so while it was better than I originally expected, it didn't live up to the hype.  Mike Myers' role was totally awkward- hard to take him seriously.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I bought this game thinking it was like the popular internet game, Pandemic and i was right. the game functions just as it should and its cheap for the replay value. my only complaint is that, if you arent experienced, youreally need to knuckle down in order to beat it. i would recommend this to a friend or even a complete stranger.
1442444053|5.0|This book kept a famly of 3 very engaged and happy for weeks.  My 9 year old son said he wished the story had not ended.  Brilliant characters, nice story, and the hardback version has wonderful color plates which my son enjoyed so much.  It is a difficult book for a 9 year old but if the child can read 6th grade level it should be fine.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am a big fan of Temple run. The graphics are much better than the first and the monkey is bigger!
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|The game play is very unique making it a very special game.  I have never played anything like it.  It kept my interest for a few days.  Good game, but not my style.
B007PFD90G|4.0|Josehn Anton is the story of the war going on between enlightenment and the fundamentalist  desire to return to the dark ages  it reveals the fussy thinking of the left and lack of willingness to stand firm on basic I rights of free speech.  Tom s
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I had to use the Hints a few times to get through the game.  I love games that make you think, and this one does.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I quite enjoyed reading this book. The storyline was well constructed and it held my attention., although I think I prefer other authors.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I really like this series.  the island myseteries and the cast are great.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.<br /><br />Definitely worth it!
0060254920|5.0|I started reading this to my Grandson when he was 6 months old.  It has been his favorite book since then and he is now 6 years.  I have bought another one for my soon to be Grandson and will continue the tradition with him.
B0017APPT8|5.0|Love all the MIB's and know my children have watched all of them as we'll. Love family movie night!! Would recommend!,
B00122OCJ0|5.0|Once in a while, I'll hear music that affects me so deeply that I &#34;have to have it&#34; at any possible moment - this is one of those. I have it on CDs at work and at home, as well as on my phone's MP3 player. Incidentally, it sounds PHENOMENAL when I feed that MP3 player through the car's stereo system.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Enya's since &#34;Oronoco Flow&#34; but this is, in my opinion, the best thing she's ever done.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Love Dexter, and anything showtime!! I have seen all the seasons now. Can't wait for the eight season to start!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|PBS has brought us this gem of a program.<br />Thanks for making it available on Amazon so<br />that I can catch up with it.
B0033807E0|5.0|I LOVED this book. There were so many surprising changes. Definitely my favourite. Can not wait for the next book!
B004SBQAN8|4.0|The dvd played well and it arrived within the time frame. I'm very happy with it to aid in my &#34;I Am Number Four&#34; series collection.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|I heard Doris Kearns Goodwin talking about the book on TV so I thought it would be interesting.  Would recommend to others
B0034G4P80|5.0|Dvd plays amazingly and the case looks almost new. I'm a huge Thor fan so this was an awesome buy.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a wonderful read.  The Secret Garden magically heals two lonely, sickly  children.  As the garden is loved and nurtured the children grow strong and healthy as well.  The garden and the children seem dependent on each other in order to stop withering away and to thrive.  This classic is a great story for any reader.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Dvd plays fine and it arrived within the time frame. I have the rest of the movies for the Avengers and was very excited to get the mash-up movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game it keeps me and my friends busy great way to pass timeand is perfect for kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've always loved stories of  &#34;What If&#34;; particularly stories that ask what might happen if the world was to essentially end as we know it and become a barren wasteland.  Hugh Howey's response to this question is smart, thoughtful, and at times very dark; especially in the first third of the Omnibus. But in his world, the human spirit and need for freedom is at odds with the need for order and stability. His characters are multi-faceted and interesting with both trials and triumphs in their pasts and present.<br /><br />He is adept at setting the tone and pace of each novel with vivid descriptions of his world and the culture that resides in it. His use of metaphors and similies are abundant and give context and additional depth to his meticulous description of the setting. It all adds up to a supremely good read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the story, very entertaining, interesting, could'nt put it down!  Found the main character's  drawing you into the whole mystery, which keep you reading to find the solutions.
B000FBJF78|5.0|I love the author's clear and vivid description of the exotic African setting of Gaborone in Botswana. I enjoy reading the brief references to the political leaders and philosophers of the area even though I know nothing about most of them. But mostly, I enjoy the interesting way the author has crafted his sentences and sentiments of his characters; they do not feel anywhere close to Western cultural beliefs and yet seem as though they used to be a long time ago.  The daily conventional tasks of living for a very unconventional woman are described beautifully. It reminds me of the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. If Alexander wasn't so obviously a man's name I would have thought the author to be a woman as so much of the pages talk intimately about the differences between the sexes from a woman's point of view. I would very much love to know how to pronounce the abbreviations Mma. and  Rra. In my head I read them as M-ma and Ra which I'm certain is totally wrong. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a quirky, well paced novel that leaves you feeling refreshed.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I feel as though I needed cliff notes to understand the deep meaning of this book. The comparrison of different religions to the characters and animals was too heady for me to  comprehend. After all it is a nonfiction book. It was the first book I read on my Kendall Fire which I received for Christmas. I loved th eexperienceof being able to read under the covers at night and I am very pleased with Amazon. Just push a button and you have the book at hand. I was amazed at the whole experience I just thought the book was hard to understand. Jo Ann
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is such a fantastic transfer.  If you've been waiting like I have to get this on blu ray, then I highly suggest it.  I won't bother going over all the plots for the 4 movies, we all know what they're about.  With such an awesome transfer, you can pick up on a lot of subtle details. Honestly, it was like I was seeing and hearing it for the first time.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Still interesting with compelling writing.<br />New characters help.<br /><br />Backgrounds are lush and beautiful to look at, as are the costumes.
B005X7HAAS|5.0|Above average Yakuza film good story action mayhem!Good transfer and deal with thier codes and sense of honor nice peek at Japan!Good shipping speed!

B00AREIAI8|4.0|the graphics are great,I just wish it loaded faster and you could get diamonds easier. It keeps me occupied-really fun
B0058EBNAO|5.0|On my EVO 4G, it has a widget problem when loaded on the SD card, but that is more a limitation of Android than of this app.<br /><br />It's as accurate as any, it has a ton of information available, lots of control over notifications, and a nicelooking interface.<br /><br />All of the other weather apps I've used have been larger and slower than this one, and have offered fewer options for customization--I normally deal with 3G connections at best, and this app deals with those speeds and limitations well.<br /><br />The only reason I would withhold that last star would be the widget/SD card problem, but since that is, as I said, a limitation of Android, they get all five.  As near as I can recall, this is only one of two apps I thought deserved five stars--the other one is Evernote.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|For the first 15 minutes, the idea of watching a cute and fluffy Teddy bear act raunchy and rude... was funny. By 20 minutes in the novelty had worn off and it was just raunchy and rude. I'm not bothered by that... it just wasn't funny.
1589949811|5.0|If you like Lord of the Rings books, movies and want to re-experience it in a new way get Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.  This game lets you assemble some of your favorite characters (some you may have never heard of too) and complete quests from the trilogy.  The art work is fantastic and different from the movies which will give you a new experience of J.R.R. Tolkiens world.<br />I personally got tired of games like Trading Card Games because of spending tons of money just to find one card. This LCG (Living Card Game) is totally different letting you battle against the encounter deck and complete quests with help from friends.  Every core set has the same cards so you will be able to make at least one really good deck and one pretty good deck. Also, you may get expansions which doesn't just have new exciting ally's, heroes, attachments, and events, but it also has brand new adventures.  This game has a lot of possibilities.  Enjoy it!
B00683JK9K|4.0|Read the reviews and decided to give it a try. Says it needs Adobe Air, which is available on Amazon, and is on my device. I played one puzzle thus far with no problems, but didnt need to turn any pieces. I had no missing pieces, but as one reviewer mentioned, its possible they just got hidden under the puzzle, as that has happened to me in other puzzle apps. Just try moving the puzzle around.  I will update if any other issues arise after I've had a chance to play bigger puzzles.  Just wanted to note that it does work on the Kindle Fire HD.
B0073U2FB2|2.0|Not the best but creative. I don't think I will watch it again..But buying movies before seeing them is a risk.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|Classic sounds like the old days. The boys got back to their roots and this will make tru ZZ fans happy.

B000GRPWMI|5.0|This book is great, I am not a reader and i can't put it down.  It's highly recommended to everyone
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest book I've ever read on the subject matter.  It was required reading for my Practice (business) Management class, and I absolutely absorbed it in 3 days.  If you desire to be great, or to at least learn what it takes to be great, or to purposely develop greatness in your work, or in your company, this book has everything you need!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is amazing! There are twists and turns in every chapter. You will definitely leave wanting so many questions answered but being too terrified to know the answers!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Was so good wrote a review for the first time.  Wow.  Writing style is excellent.  One of the best books I have read in a while...
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|what can I say.. I love the first one so I had no doubt this one would be just as awesome.
1118109791|5.0|Great for prepare gmat exam. Although it is a used one, the quality is pretty good. Only con is I didn't have enough time to finish all the questions in it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you loves super Mario bros, you will surely love this game! Awesome game. I feel 8 yrs old again. (I'm in my 30's)
0470449756|5.0|New, and shipped fast. Good book for gmat exam. But itis necessary to buy the green book which have other parts of the exam.
B0000683DH|4.0|Well, it has all be said... one of the best Star Trek movies in this celebrated series.  I wonder, however, in this day and age of so many remakes, isn't it time for a new movie with modern technology to redo the entire Khan story?<br /><br />A Trekkie can dream, right?
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good Book.  I wanted to read the book after I say the movie.  Reading the other books Larsson wrote now.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|I only played it about 5 minutes before  posting this review. Playing on my R2D2 phone, have not yet tried the transformer tablet.<br />I really like the 3D effects. Controls seem like they work well, but take a little getting used to them. I love mahjong so think I will probably play this a lot. My only down is that I don't find an option to turn off timer. That would be great!<br /><br />Here is my edited review:<br /><br />I am not understanding all the bad reviews! This is the best game Amazon has given us in EVER!<br />When  I got home from work, I put the game on my Transformer and played about 3 hours after dinner. It's an awesome game! The controls worked terrific! They take some getting used to as as I stated above. I was able to rotate in every direction & make the tiles bigger or smaller. The trick is to place it on an angle so you are viewing more than one side of the puzzle. You also don't need to see the face of the tile to select it. If you know what the tile it is and where it is positioned,  you can select it from any angle to match it. For those complaining about how Mahjong is a game on concentration, not speed, it takes much concentration to remember what tiles are in what positions so you can select them without seeing the face!<br />As for the timer, it was originally a concern of mine also. But after playing, I found the timer ticks in milliseconds or something. It actually goes very slow. It never ran me out of time, and just became a non concern, ignored completely.<br />I played almost all the boards before I got tired and had to go to bed. I finished 95% with 2 stars. The other 5% was a mix of 3 & 1 star. I loved the game so much, I will most likely play this until I have 3 stars on every board!<br />Over all, I can't say enough how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! I would score it TEN stars!
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I thought this game was fun but a tad too simple and redundant &bull;  Although I think it was worth the price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Purchased on Audible. Heard it four times already. LOVE LOVE Ami!!!!  A MUST MUST READ!!! I was saying WTFrench??? Unpredictable. Pick it up!!!
B00536OCYG|5.0|my husband is a great fan of this music and I ordered it for him. Pink Floyd as a group is one of the best
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|One of the best shows on television today,,,, and PBS again reigns supreme!<br /><br />I KNOW I am not the only fan of Downton Abbey but when my husband began watching it with me I knew it was a winner.<br />I previously owned Seasons1 & 2 on DVD--- however, when blu-ray became available, I had to get all three seasons on blu-ray!<br />If you don't have it --- get it NOW.  Be prepared to laugh and cry as you get to know the Grantham Family.  Enjoy.
B000JQUQZO|5.0|What was in the mind of this man? That is why I have this one on my kindle..wonderful reading for you
B005F265CA|5.0|This movie has always been a family favorite and I finally bought the blu-ray version,<br />What a fantastic fun movie at a great price.
B002B8ELGS|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and recommend it if you like foreign films..it is a masterpiece and truly a lovely film
0525953728|5.0|Book gives you the true inside story of what actually occured on the mission to track down Osama Bin Ladin.  The story lets you know that the Soldiers involved in this action are trully real heros that give up many aspects of life to preserve the freedom we all enjoy.  The story line was easy to follow and gives me the true picture of what actually happened to bring the Top Target of terrorism to rest.  Completed the reading of the book in a couple of days, kept me engaged.  Highly recommended.
B00000AOUD|5.0|this one was a favorite of my husbands and he has been looking for the vinyl for some time now
B0091REZMW|4.0|enjoy playing your game could use a few more twists. a d turns. but overall fun and entertaining look toward for new apps.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I thought the Martian was a great story and kept me on the edge from cover to cover. Would definitely purchase more books by this author.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|Big fan of Andrea but highly disappointed in David Foster trying to gain American Idol fans and alienating real fans of real music! Quiza Quiza has been botched by JLO and this is a marketing move which was not needed, the album is ok but this track has to be deleted! Celine Dion, Barbara Striesand are accepted but JLO? What next Pitbull and the Gangam style guy? I saw Andrea live last Valentine's Day perform with Cuban Soprano Eglise Gutierrez and she had everyone standing on their feet! Eglise held her own with Bocelli and watch out, but this JLO choice is mind boggling, real fans of music even latinos know JLO is not a real singer she is the product of great PR marketing and nothing else just look at her acting. David you put Andrea with Eglise or Paloma San Basilio and you have my respect but not with manufactured pop crap!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is by far 1 of the best continuing dramas on PBS. Each successive season has maintained quality, caliber if script, actors and intrigue.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The book was completely exquisite. The attention to detail and the subtle nuances in the characters were superb. Given the briefness of the story, i was completely taken aback of the scope of the story. The reader has no problem understanding the &#34;magic&#34; within the story, it's told in a completely plausible way and the ending neatly tied the story together. Definitely worth the read.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|fun game is better than a lot of others I have played like this. can spend just a few minutes or a lot longer without running out of energy and such.
B003D0ZNWY|4.0|Some of the symphonies are broken up on different disks and the 16th disk is a collection of songs by the Italian composer Antonio Buzzolla.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever love it the updates are common animals baby animals fun lol get it its worth it
B007TK77QE|4.0|If you are expecting a Harry Potter for adults then do not buy this. I was surprised that she could write something like this. Yes the book is hard, maybe depressing but really portrays a situation that exists in a lot of countries. I did not read any reviews before buying it, so maybe I was not disappointed like some of the other readers. Definitely not a comedy.
0425263908|2.0|I spent $15 on a novel that seemed to come across as enticing. Granted, I'm only seven chapters within the novel, and I'm not happy already. All I see is a 50 Shades wanna-be, and to be completely honest, it makes me sick that people mooch off others' phenomenal ideas to make a quick profit. I expected better out of a writer who has incredible WRITTEN talent, but seems to be too molded off the publishers to actually express that talent. There is no tension whatsoever, no development of the actual plot, NOTHING. Smut on pages. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for a breath-taking intimate scene, but when it occurs within the first 80 pages where it means nothing but an attempt to give your reader a hard-on, I'm disgusted. Unfortunately, I'm going to finish it so I'm not out fifteen dollars, but I would not recommend this. Better luck next time.
B0086700CM|5.0|When i first found out about temple run i was at my friends house. she had it on her phone. wen i got home i immediately searched for it on my kindle fire. the second it was done downloading i played it and got addicted. i rate this game five stars cuz it is entertaining, exciting, and most of all addicting! i just found out about temple run 2 and im downloading it rite now. Hope its as good as this one!!!
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I enjoyed this book and its information.  The writing is conversationalist and easy to read and retain. I believe the methods endorsed will certainly work.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I personally love Harry Potter, so this was a great series for me to buy. It shipped to my house fast and it's a great gift for yourself or for someone else, plus the price was right!!
B00AYB0SX4|1.0|It was so bad, I forgot the majority of the film 20 minutes after watching it. Nothing about it was remotely well-made, and the story made very little sense. Just poorly done in every regard. DO NOT pay attention to reviewers who liked this film. It is tripe, and should be avoided for the trash that it is.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Hold your breath flight. Enjoyed the whole movie and will watch again. John goodman was so believable in his role.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I purchased this CR-5400 MicroSD to MS Pro Duo Adapter (Dual Slot) so I could add extra memory to my Sony PSP. I added two 64GB cards for a total of 128GB on my PSP.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I had seen this book at Urban Outfitters and took a picture to buy later for my kindle. I saw it on the kindle daily deal for $2 and snatched it up after Christmas. I really liked the creepyness of the pictures throughout the book. The author did a great job creating stories and lives from these old photographs. The reading level is for youth, so I finished it fairly fast. It ended where there could potentially more books, which I'm not a big fan of unless you know if going into it that there will be more books to read later. Overall, not a bad story and had the potential to be a good series.
1419705849|5.0|WANT IT, BUY IT,GET IT, READ IT, ENJOY IT AND THEN RE READ IT. TELL YOUR FRIENDS, THEY WILL LOVE IT TOO.
0312330537|5.0|I came to love the teller of this story and so many of the characters that people it.  This is an adventure story, a story about redemption, a story of love found and love lost, it's a journey through the heart of Mumbai and the heart of a man.  It's about  everything that makes a good read. While reading this, I had the same feeling that I had as a child when I heard those magical words &#34;once upon a time in a faraway land&#34; and settled in  for a good story.
0545265355|5.0|WHAT CAN BE SAID. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME. GREAT SET OF BOOKS TO READ. GET IT AND READ IT.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|This movie seemed very strange when I started watching it. I'm normally an action movie person myself, but I like the occasional different movie so I watched this. I have to say I loved it. I loved the storyline. I loved the characters. I loved the cinematography. I loved the actors. Overall this was a great movie to me and after you are finished watching the movie you start to like it more and more when you think about it. So give it a try!
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book lacks any type of climax.  The book is filled with to many adjectives and has numerous pages of pointless information that leads no where.  I love Rowling but this book is not worth it.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|This app made my kindle fire hd crash multiple times. I couldn't even remove it from device without freezing. I had to use my pc to delete it from my account.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I think this great for my kindle !!!<br />I would tell my friends and family to use and I have this for myself and my family!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I liked all the suspense and how in the end it keeps you wanting to know more and pick up the next book. This books for anyone who likes any of these genres, adventure, mystery, Greek mythology, or action.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Nicholas Sparks always delivers. He has a way of writing that makes me feel like I know his characters.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a book that stumped me until near the very end.  I normally get an idea when reading novels about WHO DID IT AND WHY.  This book was an exception.  Couldn't wait to read next page.  Highly recommend.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Excellent.  The book has all the proper elements. Great believable characters,  people with  hopes, dreams and sorrows.  Breathtakingly images of beauty and battered lives.  Honest  portrayal of the harsh reality of war, the breaking of the most promising.  The harsh reality of the aging with their hopes, dreams and sorrows.  Life, and all it holds for better and worse.  Most of all you will never guess the ending yet you will not want to turn the last page.  New reader to Kate Morgan but awaiting her next book.<br /><br />.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Gosh, I could not put this story down! It captured me from the first 2 pages. I enjoyed the go between from past to present. Love always endures with this author...loved it!!
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Very entertaining and funny movie. Even has a dramatic side to it. Jake and Anne do a great job in this movie!
B008469DGY|4.0|I HAVE THREE BROTHERS, THEY ALL PLAY GOLF. THEY ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET ME TO PLAY. I AM ALWAYS IN THE ROUGH OR OUT OF BOUNDS. THIS FLICK GOLF IS VERY EASY TO PLAY. AND THERE IS NO NEED FOR CLUBS OR A CART.
0553381695|5.0|Overall an awesome read!  I really liked the whole format of the way the story unfolds, from book to book and page to page.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game, it's beautiful  to play , love the music, you build a pony land with shops and homes . yes I'm in my 30s, this is great for adults,and kids.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love this email program. Up-grades are always better for users. Thanks Yahoo ! Keep up the great work. What more can I say? It works like it should.
B0065IBZI2|5.0|Snowed in at Wheeler Street, the duet with Elton John is worth the price of the whole album. I'm finding this period in Kate's recordings to be astonishingly vivid, substantial and rewarding.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like the game it's lots of fun and challenging. The only thing I don't like is that on cell phones the game glitches wayyy to much and it makes me and all my friends really mad.
B004I744AS|4.0|The Dictionary does just what I wanted it to do...help me understand a new word or learn to pronounce a new (or old) word correctly. Does the job. A couple of the word games are challenging and fun also.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|This is one of my favorites and decided it was finally time to have it. It was quick in coming and is fabulous.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars is fun, Buy it (it free)<br />what else can I say.<br />like it so much thinking getting the $1.00 one.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Why it took Pixar so long to put out this movie in Blu-Ray is beyond me.  But when you play it on a TV with 1080p resolution, you will be amazed.  Some scenes (like the swim over of the reef) nearly looks real!  Awesome movie that definitely benefits from the greater quality of Blu-Ray.  Buy this movie.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|The only thing about this series I don't like is losing some key actors/actresses (I don't to spoil the series for anyone who's no up to date.)  I would have chosen to re-cast instead of killing them off. I'm sure many wouldn't agree, but I'm sure just as many would! Soaps do it all the time!  Anyway, I can't see giving the actors/actresses so much control over the story line.  How many more are they going to have to kill off when they decide to leave??<br /><br />One more unreplaced character by death and I'm done with this series.
0439023491|3.0|I read the first of this series and was surprised how good it was.  So I bought the second book and dove in.  I nearly gave up reading it a few times as I found it somewhat slow and not as interesting.  But figuring I paid money for the book, I kept going.  And it got a bit more interesting here and there.  And then about halfway through it got really interesting again.  So if you buy this book, just get through the first part and you'll be rewarded in the second part.  Stayed up until 3 am reading the last of it so my wife can start it today....
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This turned out to be my favorite Bond film, both for the plot and the music. Daniel Craig is the best Bond so far.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book. It's not easy to carry a story through with only one person talking most of the time, but this author did it very well. I think the personality of the main character was very well done and plausible for an astronaut. They are risk takers by their very nature and this character follows that well. There is a lot of science and engineering in the book as the character works through problems. It's all very interesting, although I am not an engineer and couldn't comment on accuracy, it all seemed reasonable to me.<br /><br />If you are offended by strong language, this won't be a book for you. However, if you like realism and expect a person that thinks they are going to die to be mad about it, you'll appreciate the candor. It's not a delicate book, it's pretty hard core and in your face, but I appreciated that throughout.
B0053KWDES|2.0|so the FiiO E11 came today..... was excited when i saw it in the mail but when i oped the package i was very disappointed with the package and how it looked. First off the tin box that amp came in looked like its been reused to package the unit, the unit it self had a small chip on the edge (witch I didn't mind as much, but did expect it to be with out fallows since its supposed to be new) plus there where some hair? stuck on the the rubber feet that is not shown in the pick from the seller. On top of that it did not come with anything and i mean ANYTHING!!! no charging cable no instruction manual I mean they could at lest put a peace of paper illustrating some of the features. Now after opening the back cover the battery looks like its old and had ben used for a while, it was compressed like how an old battery would look. As for the how the amp was operating, at this point I cant say, the amp did not have a charge so I cant even try it out yet. will re-review the amp and maybe give it a few more stars if the amp even works. over all sad to say very disappointed on the quality of the packaging. This is the first time I had bought something from amazon that i really dislike. should have shell out a few more green to get a nicer amp. I would have to say if you want something cheap this is the cheapest POS you can get. Don't wast your money and be disappointed like i was. might just send it back if the amp don't even perform as advertised and I do believe that I just might have gotten a refurbish amp..... we'll see what happens....
B00005QG9J|5.0|Every Saturday Morning, I wake up, drink a cup of coffee, get in my ancient mini-van, blast Morning View from its yet-spry speakers during the drive to my favorite run, and emerge to face 74 minutes of sweat and joy heading this record's Warning! Absolute Must Have!
B00005LK94|5.0|this is a great family movie that I can watch over and over again and do very often. Everybody can relate to it
B007DIQC90|5.0|This is one of those albums that intrigues your ears so they hear it long enough that your your heart likes it enough that your mouth sings the songs while you work. Really good music!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The app is wonderful to play but sometimes it doesnt want to open. The game is a lot pf tune and perfect for horse lover's. I do wish it was easier to get gems and that the app would open all the time.
B0026IQYEA|5.0|Excellent acting and incredible costumes--this historical drama is informative as well as entertaining. Blanchette should have taken the Oscar (even though Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love was also wonderful)...
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My son and wife are hooked on this game and so am I now it does get quite repeditive after awhile I mainly keep playing so I can have the highest score

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I haven't had these headphones long, but I am optimistic about them.  I've had a number of other headphones for work that have fallen apart after a few months.  These felt much more solid as soon as I took them out of the box.  2 months in, and I'm very happy so far.  No complaints.  As far as I can tell, I would recommend these.

B008NA2JMQ|4.0|I bought this book after I found out their was a film adaptation of it being released this year, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />Initially I was off put by how shallow and unpleasant the protagonist of the story was but I found myself hooked and reading nonstop.<br /><br />Should make for an entertaining movie.
B004X80QNG|5.0|I've looked at probably a hundred task and time management apps and PI has one of the most detailed implementations of the GTD method that I've seen. I have both the iPhone and the iPad versions and I'm very happy with both of them. It comes with no less than 14 different pre-defined groups or folders allowing you great flexibility and power in implementing the GTD method or whatever system you want to use.  Besides offering tags and starred items it also offer contexts, which not all task apps do. It's also the only task app I saw that offered a powerful calendaring feature as well as access to your contacts list from within the app--no more switching between apps. PI also makes good use of color and icons in the task section if you like having those. The multiple calendar views are aesthetically nice as well as functional. Finally, it has a notes section for taking notes.<br /><br />One thing I'd like is I wish is it was universal app with a desktop version that I could have on my laptop. If you want that, I'd suggest taking a look at 2Do, Appigo To Do, and Toodledo (actually a website that you can access from your laptop or desktop), which were the only other apps that I found that have iPhone, iPad, and desktop versions. (Note that you will have to buy the desktop version from the Apple store, as only the Android version is offered on Amazon). I'd also like colored group icons just to spice up the black and white look of the group section, but that's a minor issue. A bigger issue (and the only one I found) is the lack of subfolder capability. You can only go one  level down from the main screen. However, the vast majority of task apps also don't offer this feature. If you want nestable folders I'd suggest LifeNotes To Do by Christian Stone, which is also a great app. Overall though, PI is a very useable and powerful task app that offers the user a huge range of configurable options, more than any other app that I looked at, and I probably looked at every major offering in this field. All in all a great task app and one of the leading products in its field.ffering in this field. All in all a great task app and one of the leading products in its field.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game. lots of stuff to do without having to spend real money. can play for hours. look foreward to updates and upgrades. thanks
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Richard Thompson has been putting out consistently solid new material for over decades as a solo artist. 'Electric' is no exception. His guitar playing is phenomenal, influenced by many styles but very unique. Unlike some other rock singers in their 60's, Richard's deep baritone voice seems to improve with age. His lyrics may not be the most upbeat but they are intelligent with some dark humor. I personally prefer 'Electric' over his last effort 'Dream Attic.' The songs are more interesting musically to me, though 'Dream Attic' had its moments. The highlight for me is Good Things Happen To Bad People' where his singing and guitar playing is I think the best I've ever heard from him. And, the bonus CD has some excellent material, not just filler.<br /><br />This release is on par with my past Richard Thompson solo effort favorites including 'Hand of Kindness (1983)' 'Rumor and Sigh (1991)', 'Mock Tudor (1999)', 'The Old Kit Bag (2003)' and 'Sweet Warrior (2007).

B00097E4A6|5.0|Looked high and low for this one and I have to say it was worth the hefty price tag.<br /><br />Comes with plenty of pieces to build a study and tall bridge.<br /><br />Nice design alterations are included on the back of the box (to make an elevated road, for example).<br /><br />Very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />Highly recommend for any Lego lover...

B000056Q81|5.0|Francoise Hardy's music was introduced to me through a video of &#34;Tous Les Garcons et Les Filles&#34; and I LOVED the music...her voice!  I've always wanted to learn French.  I've taken a class ~ life interruption ~ tried again ~ interruption ~ and at 43, after being introduced, was so inspired by Francoise's music I've picked up the language again...using her songs/lyrics for study in addition to the French study books I've purchased :)  Learn by song...just like the kids today ;)<br /><br />So, my admiration is two fold...  Her songs are lovely...and inspiring!

B008DKBO8G|4.0|This was exactly what I wanted for my Kindle PaperWhite.  A good snug fit, but not too tight.  Material and stitching are good quality.<br />I only took off a star because of the velcro flap enclosure.  The flap part only has 2 thin strips of velcro while the part it adheres to is a long wide strip.  It's the tiniest little detail that I worry down the road how well it will still work.<br />For now, this is a great option!
B008ENA74E|4.0|I thought the author did a great job of explaining how the culture had changed over time.  It was interesting because he really did want to believe the Goldman was better than all of the others.  He didn't want them to fail.  But he needed to make sure everybody knew why.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|All you need to say is it is another John Grisham blockbuster.  A great read you will not want to put down.

B00371V6SE|3.0|Certainly a fetching story. No doubt. Romantic as expected. But the linguistically it is just not good. It's my first book from Nicholas Sparks and I had expected a higher level to be sure. And yes: I can make judgements about that even though english is not my native language
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not the usual fun J.K. Rowling read.  I think she should stick with magic and let someone else write about strictly muggle life.
B004M5HUXE|3.0|I can't say for sure because I haven't done a side by side comparison, but the text and spacing seem off somehow. Not confidence inspiring.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is as much fun watching my 2 1/2 year old grand son play as it is to play myself.  Another big score for the creaters of Angry Bird.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|This is My FAVORITE movie of ALL time! I've viewed it over 100+ times and I am sure I will view it 100 more.<br /><br />I recommend 'The English Patient' to anyone that truly loves movies.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is excellent.  This game is my life.  I have been know to play for hours at a time.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I love this CD and I listen to it almost on a daily basis. I gain Inspiration from it so I use it as my background music when I write. Philip Glass did an Amazing job with this music and added so much substance to an already Beautiful movie. Moving. Beautiful. Haunting. GREAT!<br /><br />I recommend this CD to everyone that loves beautiful music.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I make it a point never to read sad novels but this one is as hilarious as it is heartbreaking. An enjoyable and thought-provoking read
B009HNDCC4|5.0|I've loved this show since season 1 and unlike many series that have a strong first season and then fizzle, Modern Family is still going strong. It's smart, witty and fun. I can't wait to see the rest of season 4!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|For engineers and armchair engineers alike, this is a cool and mildly technical read. I was reminded a bit of the technical explanations that Umberto Eco did in Foucault's Pendulum.<br /><br />Overall, it's good sci-fi and a great read. I'm a frequent reader of less well known writers on Kindle, and Andy Weir's Martian is in my top 10.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 its way better than temple run<br />if anyone is out there not sure to get it GET IT<br />DOWNLOAD IT you will be glad you did dont<br />think just click the download button do it NOW
B005JR3Y5W|1.0|It took more than 2 hours and couldn't open the link. I had to watch the episode for my class so I wasted my money and time.
B00APJLX8E|2.0|My fiancee and I rented this hoping for a bit of light entertainment after putting our son to bed since we both agreed the concept of a hotel for monsters had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, that potential was never realized, and many of the jokes fell flat.  In a time where many &#34;children's&#34; animated movies have layers of depth, intricate plots and jokes that would go over the child's head, but directed straight at the parents, this straightforward, dull movie was a massive disappointment.  We stopped watching it halfway through, having decided it wasn't getting any better.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Great setlist...good sound...it's Metallica...period. Awesome visuals and the extras section is pretty cool. A little more behind the scenes would have really put this DVD over the top.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I seems silly to even rate a movie that is so widely known. That being said, somehow I've never seen it until I bought it on instant streaming. It was great! The character and plot development were really well done, and the closing action was really drawn out, but in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00000IMTE|4.0|Though not as epic as Rainbow Rising, this album features the most known Rainbow song and one of my favorite tunes of all time. Man On The Silver Mountain, is killer. It doesn't need to be blazing fast, heavy as a rock, or so brutal your ears will bleed. This track is mellow and powerful at the same time. Self Portrait is a good rock song, and is one of Dio's most underrated performances. Black Sheep Of The Family, an upbeat track and is just as powerful as the first song. Has a great groove feeling to it. Catch The Rainbow, one of the songs that will live on through the ages. If you have never heard this song you need to. Snake Charmer is upbeat and has one of Blackmore's best guitar performances on the whole album. The Temple Of The King, a mid pace mellow track and it is a decent track doesn't match the energy of the first tracks. The last two tracks are pretty average. Except for Sixteenth Century Greensleeves has Ritchie Blackmore at the albums heaviest point and his solo is really impressive.
B0006N2EZ0|2.0|The 90's was all about melodrama, especially in the early years.  Almost every big budget movie was formatted like a made for television Lifetime soap complete with slinky scores consisting of horns luring us into the theaters.  The fact that this was originally intended to be made in the 70's starring Diana Ross and Steve McQueen is a real interesting fact because the 70's was all about grit and it would have spurned a very different movie (also since those two 70's stars had more actorly talent than the stars of this 90's hit).  I almost wish I could see THAT version, since this one was so...well, meh.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in my title, this is entertaining, but it isn't enthralling or really all that memorable.  It feels very much like a made for TV film, right down to the cringe worthy dialog and the horrible acting (sorry, but Whitney was atrocious here).<br /><br />The film centers on an arrogant diva named Rachel Marron who is living the high life as a pop star and looking forward to winning an Oscar.  Unbeknownst to her, she has been receiving creepy letters from some psycho talking about her death and someone broke into her house and so she is receiving a new bodyguard who she isn't even sure she needs.  That bodyguard is Frank, the man with only one facial feature and no real personality.  Things get more complicated when Frank and Rachel get intimate and Rachel's jealous sister stars to bare her teeth and then someone tries to get dirty and actually kill Rachel and then she wins the Oscar and, well, she closes the movie by singing `I Will Always Love You' in a strange moment that doesn't entirely make sense.<br /><br />Whitney's acting is scary bad, and Costner mopes his way through another performance.  The bad guys are easily spotted (so predictable) and some of the scenes are so bizarrely overdramatized in a way that isn't necessary.  Still, it was fun, I guess, and the music is killer (although the segments that show Rachel's music videos are laugh out loud hilarious).  It's funny to me that the star song of this film was `I Will Always Love You', which was a cover of the Dolly Parton hit from the 80's (`Best Little Whorehouse').  Like, that was a dumb move, especially since `I Have Nothing' is arguably a better song and yet suffered by being a shadowy feature and never made a focal point.  `I Have Nothing' is even a better song than the Oscar winning `A Whole New World' and could have won (probably not, considering how beloved `Aladdin' was and still is) but it really had no shot thanks to `I Will Always Love You' hogging all the attention.<br /><br />Bah.<br /><br />Anyways, this is a guilty pleasure, but I don't feel guilty about not really liking it all that much.  I understand the fans, but this is kind of lame and makes for a time waster that is only advisable on a day when you really want to waste time.ugh out loud hilarious).

B004NO03E2|4.0|Time Is Up, is the first album by Havok I have purchased. I will say it now, if you throw east coast vocal shouts in and combine it with Megadeth solos, and Slayer riffs you have an idea what this may sound like. The lead singer sounds German at some points in the album (yes I know they are American though). Havok is one of the best bands from the new wave of thrash. However, they don't really add anything new to the genre. Their intensity is with the likes of Slayer or Overkill. The solos resemble Megadeth solos from United Abominations and Endgame. The scream from D.O.A is so influenced by Tom Arya it isn't even funny. But overall, if you could combine some of the best bands of thrash and put them together and add a modern sound, it would sound like Time Is Up. If you want an recent masterpiece check this out, but it isn't close to the likes of Peace Sells, Ride The Lightning, or Coma of Souls ect ect.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really really loved the book first book I've gotten into in 3 years!<br /><br />Best love story you'll ever read :)
B007SGM084|4.0|JUst read it to see what the hype was all about.. Interesting people and story line, some intrigue,glad to read it but being 61 years old, it would have been a better read in my 20-30's
B0058YPL66|5.0|I LOVE THE SHOW SO I REALLY WAS EXCITED TO GET THE SERIES.  IT'S A GREAT ASSET<br />I LOVE WATCHING ALL THE EPISODES AND AM REALLY INTO THE STORYTELL PART OF THIS SHOW.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book.  Couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I immediately downloaded .the next book in the series.  Then went on to the third book.
B000057DOV|5.0|Muy Buen Disco de los 90, en una nueva edición de excelente calidad. Para los amantes de las grandes bandas y la buena música. Llegó a Argentina en tiempo y Forma. Bestial!
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This is NOT your typical Mahjong game but rather more of a matching game. Regardless, the rules are pretty much the same for Mahjong Solitaire as far as matching two-like tiles together but, the layouts are UNlike anything I've ever seen! The first few reviews expressed a complete dislike for this style but I personally love playing this game. I purchased it back in December when it was first released & have been playing it on my Kindle Fire HD 8\\"9 since.<br /><br /> The vivid & high definition graphics used in the game are nothing short of outstanding! Considering the constant fast-pace rendering of graphics, I've been known to play this game for over an hour and it's always performed flawlessly; never an issue with lagging, lock-ups or force closing.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little different in your Mahjong game & don't mind a timed challenge, then I highly recommend checking this one out! But the game has been recently updated with a fix so that the timer no longer runs out & ends the game; forcing you to retry the level. This allows you to continue playing but you can only receive a maximum of two stars. However, if you'd to receive three stars, you'll need to beat the clock.<br /><br />But,if you're looking for simple, quiet & relaxing Mahjong game.....this is definitely NOT it!! The music might lull you sleep after a spell but that's about all.<br /><br />*TIP* - Should you decide to give this game a try, controlling of the 3D tiles will seem a bit awkward & difficult to maneuver at first. But with more practice, it DOES & WILL become much easier with each game you play. Just be sure not to swipe with your finger or stylus across the screen too quickly when turning the layouts. Making small, short movements will result in a much more controllable atmosphere.<br />Enjoy! :)<br /><br />::edited::
B004PE711S|1.0|I recently purchesed the dark night bluray steelbook (single disc) and when I recieved the package and i opened it...it was the damn version that best buy was selling. I pissed me off because I had contacted amazon.com and asked them if it was the candian version of the steelbook.Well they lied. Amazon needs to get familier with steelbooks. thank god for ebay i found the correct one. So before ordering the \\"The Dark Knight Blu-Ray SteelbooK (Single Disc)\\" your not going to get what you payfor.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I love Downton Abbey, but Amazon's streaming left a lot to be desired.  The HD resolution was disappointing compared to Netflix and HuluPlus.  They need to FIX THAT!
B00684J49U|5.0|Very good  dvd set no skipps jumps or any other problems, timing was good to got here  before date expected..
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Was a very good move with a plot about a princess who is suppose to marry a prince she didn't want to marry.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the show but upset I had to pay when I could get it on pbs.org for free right to my Kindle.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Had an interesting plot and Clint Eastwood played his old man role to a great ending.  Sometimes experience counts more than electronic device statistics.
0425263908|5.0|I was a little hesitant to pick this book up as I am a die hard Christian Grey fan in Fifty Shades of Grey. The first couple of pages did remind me of the book and I was about to put it down, but then the book blew it out of the park. The story line is filled with sexy scenes and a roller coaster of a relationship. You have the uber wealthy, sexy, most sought after bachelor who can't commit because of his inner demons. You have the average build twenty four year old woman who does come from her own money but is enchanted with Gideon.  You will just be on pins and needles with this one. This book you will read in one sitting I gaurantee it! Happy Reading!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's long and awesome. Lots of murder and deceit. Such a good book I just can't seem to put it down. I don't want to ruin it so just go read it. Now. Seriously. Why are you still reading this review? I'm not going to write the first chapter or anything. Fine. Whatever. I passed the limit a few sentances ago.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|The package arrived quickly and there are no problems at all with the DVD.<br />I was very happy with it.
0446310786|5.0|READ IT AS A KID AND BOUGHT IT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO IS READING IT IN CLASS...<br />WISH THEY HAD THE E-READER VERSION.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|This book is a huge letdown for me. I expected that after writing 2 books the author will write a great third one, but it seems he is going downhill.<br /><br />What I liked:<br />Among all the crud there are hidden gems on cooking and other interests of the author, for instance which herbs go well together. If you are patient enough you may find them, but since that book is a size of a Bible I gave up after forcing myself to read 1/3 of it.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br />This book is basically a though dump of the author - it seems he had written about everything he had ever read or learned about. He goes into constant tangents and tries to avoid getting to the point at all cost. Also the constant name dropping, which makes perfect sense from marketing point of view, but makes it a very hard read.<br /><br />This was a waste of my time and money, don't go with the hype the author has created. He's a great guy, but the book is awful - I would just stick to his blog which is far better.<br /><br />Also if you wanted to learn about meta-learning go ahead and download the sample - it has everything that you'll need to know without having to read all those pointless stories which were covered in the previous books anyway.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very entertaining book if at times the profanity got to me.  I thought it was a little bit too much. Great story, though!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Lots of variety with many twists and turns. Entertaining<br />Story to go along with the game. I was never bored. Great graphics. Can't wait to play the next one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put it down. The story is sad and heartwarming, will probably bring tears to your eyes. So glad I read the book, now to see the movie!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Wow! As usual the author takes you on an amazing ride through the tech  and media world of Sweden.<br />She's superwoman.

B000V39KDO|5.0|Inspirational, full of action and captivating film. Never a dull moment. Gerard butler is amazing as king leonides. Awesome sound effects, thrilling scenes and dialogues.
B00992CF6W|5.0|For all you gamers out there, get this app. It is well worth 4.99. For my kindle, it updates it for me so I think it should for the others. So don't worry about not getting 0.6.1. It definitely should update for you people with kindles. Redstone, possibly buckets, and online servers should be in the next update-0.7.0. Mojang, you've done it again. The only thing I ask is if you could come out with updates a little faster. This game shall be the best-selling game in the world.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|If you are not a serious gamer (Has never seen the sun since last year even at a girlfriends/boyfriends request) don't buy this mouse because it REALLY high powered and can be overwhelming<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Fits perfectly to the palm of your hand<br />*It has a back lit so you can see it in the dark<br />*Has a really nice braided cord (The braided is plastic)<br />*So customizable that you can even change the mouse buttons (The two main ones meant for left and right click)<br />*Its REALLY sensitive on the highest DPI setting i.e. you move one centimeter in real life, it moves 1 centimeter Precisely<br />(down to the pixels)<br />*Works even without the program installed (the buttons other then the main 3 buttons (Left, right, and middle) don't work)<br />Cons:<br />*The back light isn't that good i.e. Dark green in the program shows up on the mouse as turquoise)<br />*The pads on the mouse are rally really short (I suggest a mouse pad)<br />*The weight set inst that good i.e. It doesn't make a difference to me even with all the weights in the mouse
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are my favorite headphones! I HATE ear buds and they simply don't fit in my ears, so unless I spend a ton of money finding the right size of ear bud, I have limited options. These headphones are fantastic! I've owned 3 pairs over the past 15 years. My first pair lasted about 11 years (but not used daily) before the sound started to barely crackle through. My second pair I misplaced, sadly. And now I'm on my third pair, which are still going strong and holding up well. I love that the design is thin and flexible, so I can hardly tell they're on my head. A bonus for me is that they hold the straggler pieces of my bangs back while I work out, so I can tuck hair back if need be. The design allows the music to flow directly into your ear, but you hardly feel like anything is in your ear at all. Not so with the trendy ear buds. I always find those uncomfortable after a short while. I could wear these headphones all day and not mind. In fact, I've done it! These headphones are lightweight, comfortable, easy to wear, flexible - so they wont break if you accidently smash them at the bottom of your bag, and I can't think of a single thing I would change about them. They are the ONLY kind of headphones I will use, and I continue to seek them out after years of use. No other headphones compare. And they're such a reasonable price! Really, you can't go wrong with these!
0547884591|5.0|This is a great book, full of interesting and useful information.  It says that it is not a cookbook, but if you are interested in learning how to cook it is a great course.  Tim is very funny and full of himself as well as full of lots of great ideas.  We have given several copies of this book to friends and family.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Its a great alarm when I dont have my phone handy. Very easy to use and I would recommend it
B000002KHF|5.0|I really enjoy Van Morrison's music, but this album really stands out.  It's a cross section of his work that any fan simply must own.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie. I watch it at least once a day and cannot stop. I still laugh at the funny parts and sing along!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I had no idea this book was about teens. Nothing in the description of the books gave me an inkling of the characters' age. When I first started reading, I thought it was a flashback to when Sky was 17. I also read the reviews and all it was all glowing reviews, but couldn't find anyone who actually wrote about the plot, so that I could get a bit more insight of what the book was about. Nevertheless, I bought it and stopped reading it after page 78. I couldn't deal with the childish and immature dialog. I have no desire whatsoever to read about the confused lives of teens.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Fun and humereadle with a hint of the sadness in the wold to day and a  special effect in the end she he was telling  his two different story s.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I am only half way through the book and haven't decided if I will finish it. I know romance novels are pure fantasy but this one is pretty out there. Waking up married after a drunken night and trying to make it work, sounds pretty improbable. It would be interesting to see if there's anyone out there who has actually done this (other than arranged marriages). Also, there's too much focus on their physical appearance. Every other line is about how their eyes look, and how the hair fell on her shoulder, and his big brown eyes.....and yada yada. Not much depth of the characters.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I only gave it a 4 star because it does not have all the songs that were in the movie. Sound is great. I just wish they had included all the songs.
B000001FS6|4.0|It is not as complete as Joshua Tree.  It is somewhat uneven.  But still it holds lots of power.  Can't go wrong with this album.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I've seen these movies in all prior formats and now in blu-ray, and there is no point of comparison, especially between the dvd and the blu-ray version . The image, color and sound quality are far superior and well worth the money.
B0000025T6|5.0|None of those songs broke Top 10, when released.  But those songs give you a good peek into a part of his soul. How he sees and emphasizes with the struggle of the working class America<br /><br />Those songs are grim and haunting.  The lyrics are mainly depressing.  yet, they are so powerful.  I listened to this album for the 1st time 20 some years ago. The songs were gripping then.  And they are still gripping now.<br /><br />\\"Atlantic City,\\" \\"Highway Patrolman,\\" \\"My Father's House\\" are some of the most beautiful songs Springsteen has written in his career.

B005WMADYE|5.0|Did not expect much, when I ordered it.  What a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />(Pro)<br />All hand drawn.  No CG.  (CG is not necessarily bad, but there is something different about hand-drawn pictures)<br />Took 7 yrs to complete (thought I should mention it)<br />Pretty good sound track<br />A VERY simple, but charming storyline<br />Lovable (or unforgettable) characters.<br />Extremely individualistic (distinctive) drawings.<br /><br />(Con)<br />Some people may find the drawings repulsive.<br />Not complex. This is no Dark Knight.<br /><br />(In Sum)<br />Surprisingly good. I am from Japan and tired of those mass produced animes that feel like cheap clones of the originals (how many Gundam animes have there been?  Or how often do you see those girls with huge eyes fighting monsters? )  Redline was a challenge to the today's Japanese anime culture that produced those cheap clones.  They succeeded.  Too bad it does not have the recognition it deserves.
B008EZVNFE|4.0|I bought this because her song &#34;Is your love big enough&#34; was a freebie on Itunes. So glad I did. This album was a welcome breath of fresh air. It stays in heavy rotation in my car. If you haven't checked it out, please do!
B006PTL1QM|5.0|This is a  fictionalized account of a key player (Spielrein) in the early days of psycho-analysis, and her interaction with Freud and her analyst and lover. Jung.  The book version and the movie exert some literary license in this fictionalized history, but Spielrein's story and her virtual disappearance for almost half a century is food for thought.

B005K17RU0|5.0|It's so nice to quickly get weather info.  It's all on one page and the maps are awesome!  I recommend this app for fast and accurate weather.
0765325950|5.0|I doubt it very much.  However, it is a good compromise ending for such an incredible journey with so many and varied characters to provide a suitable ending for.  Some things were a bit too rushed and glossed over but I guess it is still a massive book and there wasn't time for everything.  Most of us who have been waiting for it will not be disapointed.

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|When my ten year old  Grandaughter told me that &#34;Wonder&#34; was the best book ever, I just had to read it to see what moved her to give such a glowing review.

0865479410|4.0|I expected the book to be a light-hearted romp through different camps of New Age positive thinkers. Instead, Burkeman takes on different approaches to happiness and systematically shows why they're flawed. What these approaches have in common is a resistance to negative thoughts and a determination to focus on the \\"positive.\\"<br /><br />The problem is that \\"positive thinking\\" is such an amorphous concept that at times he appears to be attacking a straw man.  The first chapter, \\"On Trying Too Hard To Be Happy,\\" pokes fun at one of those motivational weekend events. I have to admit I was horrified to think that the US government invests taxpayer funds to send park service employees and military personnel to these overpriced, overhyped events. Burkeman fortuitously sits next to a cynical parks employee who just wants to go get a beer.<br /><br />Burkeman identifies movements that lead to happiness while facing down the negatve, especially Stoicism and Buddhism. The chapter on goals made a lot of sense but will undoubtedly encounter resistance: goal-setting is hailed by everyone from corporate managers to new age-y coaches. I was especially facinated by the research of Saras Sarasvathy who emphasizes \\"effectuation\\" over goals, i.e., start with the means and take small steps to the end.<br /><br />The truth is, I have known people trapped in goals, but some people are extremely successful at setting very specific goals and achieving them. They set an income goal or a graduation date and they march firmly to that goal.<br /><br />The most difficult chapter was the one related to safety. Burkeman points out, accurately, that we spend millions of dollars on air safety based on isolated reports. As he points out, the strategies designed to make us feel more secure actually make us less secure in reality.<br /><br />It's a jump to this chapter from positive thinking and the book would be stronger if Burkeman had emphasized that a lot of positive thinking has been incorporated into our infrastructure. Airport security systems aren't the only ones who encourage us to think we can prevent most evils. As Dr. Gilbert Welch notes in his book Overdiagnosis, a lot of so-called \\"preventive\\" medicine does more harm than good. Doctors and medical professionals aren't always up for talking about death in the realistic way Burkeman advises. Psychologists have been promoting \\"self-esteem\\" for years.<br /><br />Finally, there is a fine line between silly \\"positive thinking\\" and the outcome of positive emotions as studied by researchers. Burkeman ignores the work of Seligman and the psychologists who study mood. He chooses a definition of affirmations that even many New Agers would reject - telling yourself an unimaginable story instead of something that's realistic and attainable as well as desirable.<br /><br />Ultimately, while Burkeman raises real concerns and logical arguments, it's not clear what we should take away or how we can revise our lives to be, well, happier, after our reading.d into our infrastructure.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|When I used to take horse riding lessons a horse stepped on my foot and I never liked horses again. When I got this game I wasn't sure if I would like it but I did. It was simple but fun and you can't get hurt. Get this game it's worth it.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great visuals. Fun costumes. Yet again though...the book is better. The main girl Lawrence did a good job though. As for the instant video on amazon...awesome! So convenient.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The language is lyrical. The plot is very imaginative - an excellent read! I highly recommend this book to all.
1451695195|5.0|This book kept your attention, but it's a book you want to read slowly and take it all in.<br /><br />Excellent!
B00683JK9K|5.0|I downloaded this app as a FAOTD. There has been no problems dragging or placing the puzzles together. I think the app is a very good simulation of actual jigsaw puzzles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a really good addition to the temple run series. With a lot of new features including mines and gems,  this sequel eclipses temple run one right out of the picture.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this one it's easy to run. Easy to understand. There is lots of different things to do. Horse moves a little weird and it takes along time to earn enough to buy more horses.it's fun to play with the horse.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One can't go wrong with the Crawley's! Julian Fellows has created a set of charecters  worth caring about and in this day and time that is saying something. I can't remember enjoying a show this much in years. If I had the option of six stars I would has taken it!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|My earliest review of this app was incorrect in that at the time, I did not know it was an issue with my PHONE... not the app. So, it is a great app. If it starts freezing up your phone... its probably time for you to set your phone back to factory settings. I was told by Geek Squad that with smartphones after about a year or a year and a half, thats what tends to happen. Once youve set your phone back to factory settings, then look up the apps from wherever you got them and you will be able to install them again..even the ones you paid for previously because it will recognize your number as having already purchased them.
B002PJN59M|4.0|The movie is a little complicated at times, partly because so many of the knights are dressed exactly a like, making it difficult to know which character is which!

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read Hopeless first which was so good. If you like a tragic romance than its a must read! Warning parts of this book may make you cry & for me... Thank GOD I haven't had to endure such circumstances... Enjoy.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This was a Xmas present for my daughter. I'm sure she loves it. She asked for this. So, I'm sure she does.
0345522478|5.0|After a friend pestered me to read this book, I did. I loved it so much that I went and bought the entire series so I could read it at my leasure and force others to join in the fun.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|ive had this over a year and have absolute no issues. it does what it says and has that sleek look.
B009ME47H2|2.0|this did not work so easy. Had trouble finding what I recorded.<br />Removed from my tablet after to many problems.<br />Hope to find a recorder that does work with ease.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|The kids loved this movie and the adults thought it was fun too.<br />We have watched it several times and know we will watch it many more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and really fun it may look stupid but its not and by the way its really addictive
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed the other Harry Bosch novels I have read. It is typical of the Bosch mysteries; the characters and action appeal to both men and women.
0307592731|5.0|I was sucked in on page one!  I laughed, cried, and loved the raw honesty. I didn't want it to end.
B003F3NDOE|5.0|What can you say about a CD set - Great! As far as the show &#34;Ugly Betty,&#34; the funniest program I've seen lately. I've seen the Spanish version years before and this is better.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved this book! Would recommend it to everyone! Great story line! Didn't want it to end! Love Nicholas Sparks books!
B005LAIISA|5.0|We had fun watching this movie as a family.  The characters are great and the music is good too.<br />We are ham and cheese!  :)

B001P8B8R0|5.0|This horse is well made and should last for a long time.  My daughter plays with her toy horses often and so far this one has held up very well.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I was introduced to this series after it went off the air. But fell in love with it. Originally owned the dvds and decided to purchase the blu-rays. I'm a little disappointed in the transfer on some episodes. Pretty darn grainy. But I think it was still worth the money.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy has again brought Jack Ryan and Jack Ryan Jr to life .  You get so envolved with this story that is a little too close to reality!
B004G6009K|5.0|I mean come on it's Disney. Great story, animation and sound. When friends come over for a movie party this movie is one of the most requested.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I am quite enjoying it, but it is rather tedious or pedantic. I think it could be a much shorter book if JK cut to the chase instead of laboriously bringing in every detail of the different characters.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Don't judge the album without listening to it front to back at least twice. The first time you listen to it you hear the studio aspect of the album. On the second listening you get the content and depth that you have grown to love from Tegan and Sara. I was lucky enough to catch Tegan and Sara in Fresno with The Black Keys, and again at Club Nokia in LA. The album sounds amazing live, and I'm looking forward to a live, demo, or acoustic version of it.<br /><br />- Yes I said Amazeringly, its an inside thing among friends. Love it. Hate it. Use it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I came across this book by chance - I usually read thrillers. I was hooked from the first page and couldnt put it down. Amazing, cleverly written and a really good story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am a hidden object game player. I like the plot to this game. It's fun and hard to put down. I recommend this gAme if you like hidden object games.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|what can i say??? best show ever, in terms of the humanity around the subject material. i only wish it were a cable program so we could have some real language that would be associated with the situations n such. n such
B005EGXTL2|2.0|***WARNING SPOILERS***<br /><br />Mockingjay is the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy and I must say ultimately I found it disappointing and disturbing even though it keeps you engaged. The final push towards the Capitol is anticlimatic when everyone seems to get to the President before Katniss and her team. Along the way and at the final step, the slaughter of innocent children and adults becomes quite extreme. The shaky mental state and nightmares of Katniss and Peeta becomes quite tedious even if it is understandable in the circumstances. I am at a loss to understand how this series can be marketed as children's books. The violence is so extreme. Is it because there is an absence of any real sex? So any level of violence is OK but sex is not?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has said that she is interested in the effects of violence on young people but she really seems to celebrate it in this book. She makes you care about the characters then kills them off carelessly. Only the central four characters continue to pull off remarkable escapes. It may be realistic when compared to a real war but do kids need this level of slaughter now to be entertained? I don't think I'll be reading it again.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|A fantastic reboot to the Dredd franchise.  Karl Urban does a magnificent job portraying Dredd from beneath his imposing helmet.  The special effects are top notch.  Overall a fantastic thrill ride.
030758836X|5.0|Great book from start to finish, so many twists and turns. Excellent writing, can't wait to read another by this author.
1609611543|5.0|This is a very nice product.  I would recommend it to anyone in need of more information concerning wheat allergies.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was already a great movie, but once I viewed it on 3D, I was blown away!  More than worth the price!
B00633PFQC|4.0|The author takes us on a ride to see wherever we should accept economics running every aspect of our lives.<br />I understand that this is a tough topic to analyze and the author shows us the problem, induces us to the conclusion that morale should be left alone in some cases but fails to describe witch morale, or who`s morale should prevail. The book treats morale as an entity, a single body of philosophical concept, witch is not the reality. So, in the end, the conclusion is: economics should not run everything, but I cannot see what framework of knowledge should.
B001202LRM|5.0|I bought this album again due to a loss of digital equipment and so new kindle ,new music.My favorite workout songs.
B000FC0O7M|5.0|Great book about a great moment of NASA.<br />I really admire the seriousness they deal with technical knowledge, and the way people made decisions back then.<br />Really nice reading.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|Sure - it isn't the perfect answer for every need (you need a speaker on your phone to use it with a phone, I think) but it really is a great device.  Daddy is what I would call TOTALLY deaf.  Seriously.  He watches TV with the sound all the way up.  But he was able to turn the sound down to a moderate level thanks to this device.  The downside is that you have to put in a new AAA battery every day.  BUT - one can buy a lot of batteries with $12-15,000!!!  Just saying.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|The culture strikes again.science fiction at its best.would recommend as first time introduction to the culture series,it makes A.I. machines witty and cranky.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Colleen Hoover is an over-analyst. The story is told in first person through Sky's eyes and the amount of detail that goes into Sky's thought processes and subtle movements can be overwhelming. Nonetheless, there's something wonderful about that over-analyzing that makes the reader understand why Sky does what she does and it's fun to see her put the pieces together. There are a few loose ends that are tied a little too easily together. It made me yell, \\"Oh, well how convenient!\\" Yet, the story moves forward, particularly 60% in when things get very interesting...<br /><br />I'll be honest - I didn't realize this was an adolescent novel. I am a high school English teacher and I'd say it's for ages 16 and up since there are a few parts of the novel I'd label \\"soft erotica.\\" There's a cheesy factor in this book that was really hard for me to overlook. There's a lot of neck kissing...too much neck kissing. Too many hands caressing faces. Too many awkward moments that made me cringe for Sky...and even more for Holder, who has to deal with this crazy teenage girl! Too many descriptions of Holder rubbing the back of his neck and running his hands through his hair. It's cheesy! Another part I hate is when authors, who clearly love books, create characters who really love books to the point that they don't even live in the real world. Sky declares, \\"I need a chapter break,\\" when she wishes life would just stop. UGH. It's like writing a book about writing a book or a movie about making a movie. It's weird. You shouldn't do it. Yet, I read the book in 5 days (at leisure) and I was intrigued by the plot line.
B00304RMFE|1.0|NOT WORTH THE MONEY even to rent; but ok to watch if someone else already owns & will let you borrow, but Animatrix already did this & did it better, the first time. Almost all story choices were lackluster & the storytelling fell victim to the classic anime blunder of: \\"Ooh look at the pretty pictures & isn't slapstick funny\\", the concept behind this production is fine - a chance to examine the Halo universe in new & different ways along different paths; however the execution is severely lacking. Instead of examining the integration of Human & Covenant forces and the consequences and difficulties through the eyes of say: a Grunt, or a new human recruit who lost family or friends to the Covenant, or a grizzled veteran Elite who has been fighting Humans since the war began we got lots of exposition in the form of story hour with pictures that retold what we already know & was mostly already explained in the games. So in closing I would ask, \\"What was the point of this production artistically - not financially we already know the point of this production financially- since there was very little added to the Halo universe, either in story, examination of alternate view points, review & exploration of events that were not given even time to develop properly in the games or other media?\\"
B002RL7W9W|3.0|After Christmas, having bought lots of legos, I still don't understand why legos are so expensive.  And licensed varieties, like this star wars one, are even more so. I bought this one online and had it shipped to the in-laws so I wouldn't have to bring gifts on the plane.  Boy was i surprised by how small this was - i was embarassed that this was the gift to my nephew, poor kid.

B001N1DPDE|4.0|This is an incredible knife...period.  Vault strong, holds an edge, great feel.  And, while the plastic part of the sheath seems to work just fine the nylon belt loop contraption simply sucks!  My snap broke off the first day!  I simply trashed the nylon webbing part and bought a plastic belt clip.  Works great now!  The sheath is the only reason this knife does not get 5/5
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love this game. It is super fun and entertaining. However, there was a bit of a glitch where if you used the 'save me' when you were really far in the game it would boot you out and in the process still used your gems and you lost all that progress. I'm hoping this new update will solve that problem :) I guess time will tell.
0316017922|5.0|Fun to read and quite a few VERY interesting concepts about human behavior, particularly mine, to consider. I intend to read it again in a week or so.
B00683JK9K|3.0|Puzzles are ok, but the delay in pieces moving/rotating and getting placed is very annoying. After only a few tries I gave up and uninstalled. I'd rather spend time counting sheep than be aggravated by a game that won't respond....
0880796863|3.0|I'd always wanted to learn tarot reading, so I bought myself this, which is supposed to be good for a first timer, but while it was helpful, it wasn't too clear and I ended up having to do way more research than what the book gave me. But maybe that's just me.<br />I ended up getting the hang out using it, still not that good, but decent.<br /><br />I still recommend it because it's still fun.
0385344228|2.0|I thought this book might be interesting, but it wasn't. A passionless and emotionless book wandered along, page by page with no climax or gotcha moment and merciflully bumped into its last page, dead on arrival. Both books (The Risk Agent) were purchased using a Christmas gif card. I should take some of the blame after reading a few of the pages of Defending Jacob but there is no defending Landay for this book.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|This app takes forever to load the contents of any story, ya the layout is fantastic but if it crashes regularly and takes upwards of half a minute to load each story whats the point?  I guess if you just skim headlines and nothing will ever interest you this is perfect.
0765325950|5.0|I was wondering how all the storylines would be tied up and finished, and I must say that Mr. Sanderson did a very credible job. This has probably been my favorite series of all time and I was saddened to see it come to an end. But , maybe this world will be revisited by Brian or even someone else who is a fan of TWOT. We can only hope.
B004HD61KE|4.0|A tightly written suspense with detailed historical backbone.  I was impressed with the author's research and loved the character development.

B008OOYALE|4.0|Nice game. Would have given it five stars, but gameplay is slow unless you spend real money. It also seems this could become expensive.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book is barely worth the effort to review it. The writing is okay, in places it feels he author is trying too hard and yet it reads like a teen English assignment. In part two, the plot finally picks up and garners some interest, only to reveal an abrupt ending that is frustrating and has no resolution and leaves the premise of the storyline unchanged.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I had to delete many apps just to play and want them back now. I'm sure the game is fun but it is taking foreever to download!

B005LAJ212|5.0|A fantastic series, one of the best we have seen for a long time and we go through around two boxes a week!!!  Could not stop watching........just one more, one more and total lack of sleep until we had finished...<br /><br />Preordered Season Two and can't wait!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven was a very good book.  It had romance and mystery, and anticipation.  I enjoy most of Nicholas Sparks books, and this one was especially intrigueing.
B0044CG71G|5.0|I am a true sci-fi fan but never thought to watch Fringe while it was grinding through the first few seasons. I think this is because I just thought it was a weekly whodunnit and had no idea the underlying story was a continuing scientific epic. I am now watching the whole series from beginning to end, just getting to the end of the third season. The show is nothing short of fantastic. I think it got short shrift because it started out a little slow in the first few episodes and the producers weren't sure how to integrate the weekly crime element with the ongoing parallel universe plot. Now there are marvelous twists, creepy experiments, whacked out technology, romance and character nuances that are just delightful. I envision a bunch of Walters in a lab somewhere dreaming up these episodes. It is just wonderful and why I love sci-fi. Start from the very beginning and watch all the way through to season five. You'll be hooked too.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|E. L. James is brilliant in this first part of a trilogy.<br /><br />Intoxicating, entrancing story line, passionate, and linguistically sagacious.<br />The beginnings of an erotic romance between Christian Grey CEO and Anastasia Steele.<br /><br />A hopeless, naive yet consenting young adult falls helplessly in love with multi billionaire Christian Grey after a humiliating interview for him for her graduating class. Clumsy, innocent Ana is immediately enthralled at the chemisty that is sparked between herself and this young, playboy in Seattle, WA. After careful consideration and heavy stalking, Christian recruits Ana for more than she has bargained for. Ana learns Christians secrets about dominance, submissive role play, erotic foreplay and uncovers a world of unknowns. She yearns to learn more about this man she has fallen madly in love with, and learns he holds a few dark secrets which may send him running the other way when she pronounces her love for him. A not so typical arrangement of  challenging humor, wit, and a man capable of anything. 50 shades of anything.<br /><br />A blush fest for the innocent, a refreshing exhibit of raw catalyst emotions. Not for the weak minded, an exploratory tale of romance in the darkest of places. *Don't judge a book by it's cover<br /><br />[...]

B009HELT3C|5.0|I like the series of men in black and missed this at the theater, so I glad it available on Amazon video.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|I think this is a really good Richard Thompson album. As the title suggests, it features Thompson's lead guitar very strongly in yet another group of very fine, melodic and lyrically intelligent songs which are superbly played and sung.<br /><br />Naturally, the whole album is tinged with Thompson's trademark bleak take on life. Don't look to this for an uplifting, smile-inducing bunch of songs - but then Thompson devotees will already know that. Titles like Stuck On The Treadmill and Where's Home? give an idea of the atmosphere and breaking relationships, financial hardship and the daily grind of life all feature strongly throughout the album, but there is a great variety of moods in the music including a strong Country tinge in places (as one might expect with Buddy Miller producing). As examples, the album opens with Stony Ground which has echoes of Thompson's Fairport roots with slightly folky-sounding harmonies coupled with Thompson's distinctively brilliant lead guitar. Sally B is much more of a rocker but with a quirky, almost chromatic melody. My Enemy is quieter and darkly atmospheric, and The Snow Goose is backed by just Thompson's acoustic guitar and some delicate harmony vocals from the great Alison Krauss, and is very beautiful and haunting.<br /><br />I think 2012 saw some truly great albums from vintage singer-songwriters - Leonard Cohen's Old Ideas, Springsteen's Wrecking Ball, Neil Young's Psychedelic Pill (let's just draw a veil over Americana) and arguably Dylan's Tempest. I put Richard Thompson in the same league as these giants and it's great to see 2013 opening with such promise. I think it will take some time to know for sure whether Electric is truly one of his great albums, but I think it might well be. It is certainly a very good one indeed: it had the same initial impact on me as Mock Tudor which I think is a towering masterpiece, so that's a very good start.<br /><br />Very, very warmly recommended.<br /><br />(By the way, I think it is worth getting the Deluxe Version with a Bonus CD. I know that &#34;bonus material&#34; can often be sub-standard filler but most of this is excellent and well worth the extra cost.)orth getting the Deluxe Version with a Bonus CD.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a wonderful game. Very addictive when you start playing it but after a while it gets boring. I think that they should undated it more( mabey put a new powerup in the ? Box) I also think they'd should make it multiplayer. But all in all this is a great game.
B0042ESTQW|5.0|This product is exteremly flexible and easily fits over the Garmin Edge 800.

It does what I want it to do; provide a protective skin over my expensive GPS unit.

0780622650|4.0|I would have casted different actors in most of the roles, but they seemed to work out well for this re-imaging of the flight of the Robinson Family. I enjoyed the cameos from the original crew and I liked the kid they got to play Will. I would like to see a follow-up movie, but I know that this one didn't do well at the box office. As for Amazon, I got fast shipping and reasonable prices.

B0036SPOHC|5.0|First it of all, let me tell you that Michael Moore is an entertrainer, certainly I don't want to be-or apperar to be-his apologist. I believe unequivocally that I have watched every one of his movies, and yes I owned two or three. But in this movie, so specially, he's right on the mark. We have become of a nation of \\"peasants,\\" really that's how we are refered from the point of view of the haves and have more. Unfortunately, most American can't or don't want to know the difficult details of how the economy works. Terms such fractional banking, fiat money, and the worse: The Federal Reserve Bank of United States, the biggest scheme divised to perpetuate debt and to make slaves of tax payers. Watch it, try to learn something from it for crying out loud. I happen to believe THAT by eliminating the Federal Reserve Bank (which is not part of the federal government but own by a cabal of invisible bankers) so that we can print our own money without having to pay interest to the cabal; THAT by dismantling the International Monetary System (IMS) and its dark side twin The World Bank; THAT by disolving the United Nations with all of its gelly fish tentacles such UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), which teaches other Third World Nations how to hate us (America) with our money; and THAT the idea of of a \\"New World Order\\" to barbed wire the world under one \\"Anglo-American\\" government; THAT . . . yes, there is more blah, blah, blah, but no body is listening and one person alone can't do much to solve the economic problems posed by Capitalism. THAT's why it is a love story.

The new man he has become, gives the story a good ending. I think this story is good for my fellow teens, it shows that all people can become new, that forgiveness is possible, and that you should always be considerate of others.

I needed this book for a class this semester and I received the book a few days before I needed to read it. We are reading it right now in class and it is a funny and classy book! I recommend reading the book! I do not recommend buying from this seller though.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  The plot was great and it was such a page turner, that I read it in one sitting.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, whether you are familiar with the type of work that the main character does or not.  Very well written and highly satisfied.
B005XLN97M|5.0|This house was actually a little bit bigger than I thought it would be (for the price) We don't have the room or the budget for the dream house, and my 7 year old loves this one just fine. She and her two friends can all play with it together without crowding. (although they fight over sleeping areas) It's kept in the same place, but doesn't seem really rickety when it's moved. That said, you may want to reinforce it with some packaging tape if you intend to make it a toy you move a lot. (It's cardboard and plastic)

B00ANW33CM|5.0|Ok so when I was looking at this game and saw the reviews I was like ehhhhh. This game must be bad. but I got it anyways and I was blown away this game is good it helps you think and it helps you see things better like matching. (also you can zoom in if you have bad eye sight). secondly some people a<br />say that it is timed now yes it is timed but if you get one it refilled the timer. secondly once the time runs out it doesn't end you still play and like I said one pair you find it refills the timer. now I still got two stars even with the timer running out. ( the music was making me dose off). The graphics are about as God as you can get for a Mahjong game on Kindle Fire. the graphical aren't awesome but theft aeent bad either I personally like this game a lot. and I encourage you to ignore the other o e stars and try it for yourself If you don't like rate it as you please I just am saying how I feel about this game. Good ahead try it its free for today have fun with it :)
0937381888|5.0|Even though English is not my mother tongue (my apologies for the errors), this book is the best book on homebrewing I read so far. For beginners, I would advise to read this book before you start.<br /><br />I put this book at the top of my list even above \\"Radical Brewing\\" and \\"Designing Great Beers\\". It is complete but remains very understandable and readable to people having no scientific background. Every aspect of homebrewing is explained from opening a can of Extract right to building a lauter tun from a cooler! Topics such as mashing, lautering, milling and lots more are explained in detail.<br /><br />To me, this book is the biggest bang for the buck.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow is so fun. Why?because trying to complete the level is some times hart but is also really fun. aspecally if you r really board on a plane or any where and you can play flow then play it and it will really make time fly
B00A90CDBA|5.0|\\" Music For A Big Night Out\\" by Scooter lives up to its title because the music on the cd does embody a vibe of getting ready  for an evening of fun.  There are 12 trance/electronic songs on this cd and \\"Army Of Hardcore\\", \\"No Way To Hide\\", and \\"What Time Is Love\\" are some of the multiple playful tracks on this cd. \\"Music For A Big Night Out\\" by Scooter is best for those who like trance cds with a club-rave theme.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love the twists, live the turnaround, love how it all.plays out. This series has good foreshadowing but not enough to give away the whole story line and a lot that makes you face palm because you missed it when it was SO OBVIOUS, but my daughter, 16, and I are very much enjoying the series

B00B92ZO3G|5.0|I was a car salesman for three years, and so I have been up close and personal with people's biased and usually negative perspective of salespeople. So it is with great delight and appreciation that I highly recommend this summary, \\"To Sell is Human... in 30 Minutes.\\" Even if you are no longer in direct sales or have never been, this is an easy to read synopsis of the new and forward-thinking philosophies of Daniel H. Pink, who attests that no matter your occupation, more than likely it involves sales to some degree. The good news, for those that detest the stereotypical salesman, is that this quick read clearly defines Pink's notions that this stereotype is outdated, primarily because the sales techniques that perpetuated it are just as pass&eacute;. In the modern information age where the customer is privy to just as much, if not more, information than the seller, the use of forceful persuasion has been abandoned for empathy, flexibility, and service to a higher cause. Furthermore this information is universally applicable, because the modern salesman is at work in almost every profession. \\"Non-sales selling\\" is an umbrella that encompasses anyone who must \\"move others\\" to accomplish their goals.
1439152802|5.0|Like Morton's other books this work also is told from several character's perspectives, from different times and places.  An intriguing mystery set in London during The Blitz, it kept me guessing until the satisfying conclusion.  I'm looking forward to Morton's next page-turner.

0385738781|2.0|The trials are over and the stakes higher than ever for Thomas and his friends. The variables are all in place and a final candidate has been chosen, putting WICKED closer than ever to finding a cure for the flare. All the gang has to do is cooperate for this one last test and they will finally remember everything; but after going through so much, Thomas isn't sure WICKED can be trusted. Upon staging a daring escape, Thomas, Minho, Newt, Jorge and Brenda navigate the disease-ridden world and see the effects of the flare first hand. And suddenly, they're left questioning the reasoning behind WICKED's actions. Do the means justify the ends? Are the lives of a few sacrificed in the name of the greater good worth it? Or was there never any hope to begin with? In the end, it's up to Thomas to decide.<br /><br />The Death Cure is the final chapter of Dashner's dystopian Maze Runner trilogy. Though I enjoyed the first two books, my liking for the third pales in comparison to previous installments. I was hoping for something really climactic, to be left with a big bang. Oh, there was a BANG alright, just not the satisfying kind. I feel sort of cheated because all I'm left with is a bunch of unanswered questions --- like, how was mapping their reactions to the trials going to create a cure? What point did it serve? To what extent were Thomas and Teresa involved with WICKED? Why was Thomas so much more important than all the rest? I don't always need or want my endings to be tied up in a pretty little bow, but Dashner places so much emphasis on certain mysteries that, by the end, you sort of expect to get those answers. Well, SPOILER ALERT, folks: you don't. He dances around these issues by asking more questions, and if you've ever watched the TV show Lost, you know exactly how frustrating that can be.<br /><br />Another problem I had with this book (and the series, in general) is that I found most of the main characters to be one-dimensional and flat. Thomas is annoying and weak, Brenda is underdeveloped and Teresa is dull. And don't even get me started on the touch-and-go love triangle. Seriously, it needed to be omitted altogether. Clearly Dashner has some issues with writing multifaceted lead characters, particularly with regard to women which is a shame because his knack for writing engaging sidekicks is quite good. Let's just say, my love for Newt and Minho was enough to let me get over my issues with the rest of the cast. These guys are the two whose fates I genuinely cared about and they are the ones I was really rooting for. It just sucks because Dashner puts them through the ringer and no one, I repeat, no one made it out unscathed!<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the series though this book was my least favourite of the three. As a whole, I think the series could've been parred down to either one really long book or made into two, at best, because so much happens that wasn't necessary to the main plot, entertaining as it was. And I know it sounds like I hated The Death Cure, I didn't. There were heart-pounding moments that kept me on the edge of my seat. We lose two more Gladers and the end action takes us back to a very familiar setting. It was appropriate to end it that way, as I felt like it brought the series around full circle.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about the book is that Dashner gets you thinking about right versus wrong and how the answers aren't always in black and white. In this war, there are two conflicting sides, WICKED and The Right Arm, and each takes an extreme stance on how to treat the disease.You start to wonder, does the end really justify the means? Is either force justified in their extreme actions? To The Death Cure's credit, I will say this--- it leaves you pondering those thought-provoking questions long after you finish reading.<br /><br />Food for Thought: The Death Cure wasn't quite the ending I hoped for in the Maze Runner trilogy, leaving me with a maddening amount of questions. Jam packed with action though, there is some sort of resolution albeit not the one I was hoping for. There's no comparison to The Hunger Games but it's still an entertaining and interesting series at the very least. I'm intrigued to see if the prequel circles back around to answer some of those mysteries, though I doubt it'll be the next book I decide to pick up.am packed with action though, there is some sort of resolution albeit not the one I was hoping for.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of Grisham's best. I think the &#34;O-Henry twist&#34; is a new approach for this author and makes the book better than ever.
0486278077|4.0|With his life spanning the later half of the 19th Century, Oscar Wilde wrote in a wide variety of mediums, ranging from poetry to plays and from essays to fairy tales, and one novel. His fairy tales are arguably the most accessible of his writings, and as is the case with fairy tales revolve around some moral theme being conveyed. For instance in `The Selfish Giant' a giant places a wall around his garden to keep the children out, and thus spring never comes on his garden, causing him to realize the result of his selfishness. Similarly in `The Star-Child' a beautiful boy is forced to come to terms with his prideful cruelty.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray can be seen as a continuing of this fairy tale manner of writing, except in novel form (though even then the novel is fairly short).<br /><br />The story begins in the art-studio of Basil, a painter who is putting the final touches on what is said to be his most greatest painting. With him is Lord Henry, a shallow obscurantist of high society who upon hearing of the figure in the portrait desires to meet with him - the figure being that of a young and impressionable Dorian Gray. The two become friends and eventually the philosophy of Lord Henry begins to have its affect on him.<br /><br />In the words of Lord Henry, this amounts to \\"if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream-I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal-to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be... The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the course of the novel Dorian comes to embrace this ideal, giving into his own inner nature: \\"Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins-he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all... For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. \\"<br /><br />Thus Dorian Gray enters into a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde type of scenario with himself where he resolves to do away with his conscience - where Mr. Hyde reveals the truth of Dr Jekyll, the portrait comes to reveal the truth of Dorian Gray, and before the end he must come to face that truth.<br /><br />The book is enjoyable, and at around 180pgs can be read in an evening. Like his fairy tales it comes away with a moral, though modern renditions of the character seem to miss this point.<br /><br />Memorable Quotes:<br /><br />-\\"You know how I love secrecy. It is the only thing that can make<br />modern life wonderful or mysterious to us. The commonest thing is<br />delightful if one only hides it.\\"<br /><br />-\\"Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.\\"<br /><br />-\\"Ah! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that<br />the portrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the<br />unsullied splendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to<br />that. Better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure<br />swift penalty along with it.

B00000JPH6|4.0|Watching The Dark Crystal is one of those happy memories from my childhood. I remember seeing it in the theater and we rented it once on VHS tape and watched it a few times over a weekend. I recently had a chance to watch it again. Did it hold up 30 years later?<br /><br />The story follows the adventure of the Gelfling Jen, the last of his race. The Gelflings vanished because the Skeksis have wiped them out. A thousand years ago, the Dark Crystal was broken and a prophecy was made that a Gelfling would repair the crystal and end the rule of the Skeksis. At the same time as the Skeksis appeared, the Mystics also appeared. They lived peaceably and humbly far from the Skeksis. They too know of the prophecy, and one of them saved Jen when his village was attacked. Now that the three suns are about to come in alignment again, the leader of the Mystics sends Jen on a mission to get the missing shard and fulfill the prophecy.<br /><br />The story follows Jen through the amazing world that Henson and Oz (creators of The Muppets) have created. And, to be honest, the real charm of the film is exploring their creativity rather than unpacking their mythology. Jen wanders through swamps, forests, and hillsides, finding amazing flora and fauna. He arrives at the home of Aughra, a Keeper of Secrets. She has a gigantic clock-work universe in her lab, showing the motion of stars, planets, and moons. It is still amazing to see 30 years later, as is the wide variety and sizes of puppets they use. The mythology is interesting enough but not particularly profound or original. It has the standard good-versus-evil elements along with the hero's journey to save the world.<br /><br />The storytelling suffers a little bit from too many voice-overs, especially hearing Jen's thoughts, which seem obvious from what we see on the screen. Maybe the voice-overs were added for the children in the audience to help them interpret what's going on. The movie might be too scary for younger children. I was eleven when I saw it in the theater and was okay, but I don't think we'll be showing it to Jacob or Lucy (5- and 3-years old as I write) for a couple of years.

1609611543|5.0|If you are feeling bloated and putting on weight, read this book for sure.  It was recommended by a friend with Type I Diabetes. His whole family is wheat free.  I decided to try going wheat free and felt a difference within days.  Dr. Davis is a little over the top sometimes, but his overall message is sound.
B002ZG999U|5.0|This movie is awesome! And Expendables 2 is just as awesome! Both are great buys!! One great movie! its a must see!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  The character development, suspense, and humor make this book worth far more than the price.  Others have given extensive reviews and I don't have much to add, but this book has earned 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive, you wont ever want to stop playing! Its almost like a temple run game but its way simpler and 10x more fun. The Colorado are so fun and vibrant it makes you happy.

B007TNQ7EY|1.0|it was fun, but after beating the game all the save info was corrupted or whatever. please share if you have the same problem.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|The love of a parent is an amazing thing but challenged with the knowledge of what they could be capable of is something very different. I couldn't put this book down. I am not sure if it's because I too also have a middle schooler or if it was because it's just very well written murder mystery. I would definitely recommend it easy to follow and easy to understand the rules of the parents. It almost leaves you wondering if you yourself would do anything different.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|We have so much fun playing this game.  Love that you can play with multiple players. Try this game for yourself!
B007NESBK2|1.0|BLUERAY DISC -  THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SONY PRODUCTION.  IT CARRIES THE EPIC LOGO.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE DISC TO PLAY.  SADE PRODUCTIONS ARE PRODUCED BY SONY.  THIS DISC IS APPARENTLY A BOOTLEG ITEM.  IT ARRIVES IN HEAVY PLASTIC WRAP. IT TOOK ME FIFTEEN MINUES TO EXTRACT THE DISC FROM THE HEAVY PLASTIC WRAPPING.  BEWARE OF THIS ITEM.  ONLY BUY SADE AUTHORIED SONY PRODUCTS.<br /><br />DVD COCERT DISC - MUSIC/PERFORMANCE IS OUTSTANDING! AS ALWAYS SADE IS A GOLDEN GODDESS, NOT A TRAINED VOCALIST OR DANCER, BUT HER MUSIC IS TIMELESS, THE BAND IS ALWAYS OUTSTANDING/PAR EXCELLENCE! HOWEVER, STILL THE 1993 CONCERT, \\"SADE LIVE\\" IN SAN DIEGO IS MY OPINION IS STILL HER BEST PERFORMANCE. SHE AND HER MUSICIANS WERE AT THE PEAK OF THEIR PERFORMANCES DURING HER FIRST TOUR.
1609611543|5.0|This book was shocking and fascinating!  I read it cover to cover in one sitting.  If only everyone knew what Dr. Davis explains in this book.  Wheat of today is not the wheat it used to be, and our bodies cannot process it w/out causing a myriad of different health problems.  If you are having a health problem, I strongly urge you to go gluten-free for 2-4 weeks and see if your problem disappears.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked this book.  I was expecting an average Nicholas Sparks story of love and you did get that, but this one had so much mystery in it that it made it so much better than normal.  I have already recommended it to several of my friends.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I saw this on iTunes in HD and it was fun. Sent the dvd to a friend who has kids and I think that will be the real audience.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|It would probably be fun for true gamers, but I am more of a Bejeweled type person.  My husband talked me into downloading it and then got annoyed with it when he tried to play it.  He doesn't have a lot of patience with games he cannot understand how to play right off.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Game is fun. Graphics simple but alright. Could earn money faster. The competitions are a nice side game. I would like more options of horses as I don't want to own a zebra or rainbow unicorn.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I do not really know how well this works as I have not tried shopping online with Amazon from my phone yet.  I am sure I will love it once I use it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Would recommend reading the series to read as they kept you guessing as too what would happen next.Hope there is another written.

B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather app is accurate and dependable. So far there have been no issues and I can recommend it without reservation.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|If you see the play- or the movie before you read the book - the book drags- the begining is all about the bishop and takes  a lot of time to develop the characters. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because it seems slow and difficult- if you didn't know how wonderful the story is.
0823015017|5.0|If anyone is interested in working with polymer clay, this is a MUST to read! I have such a clear understanding now on how colors work together and how to match them, and I've only gotten through half of the book so far! I truly recommend making the pallets they suggest making from clippings in magazines. I was amazed at how good the pallet looked after I was finished, I want to frame it and hang it on the wall!! I can't put into words how useful this book will be for the clay artist or ANYONE that's interested in designing or decorating with color, although of course, it's geared towards polymer clay!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A new clay enthusiast!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I wish more were free but this game satisfies anyway :-) mystery games like this are my favorite on my phone.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|This took me back to when I was in high school - still love Jeremy, even if my namesake is about a disturbing little boy...
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I found this to be a lovely book. A young woman, dealt a rough life when she's abandoned, finally finds a mother after countless foster homes. But trust comes hard & soon all her relationships become tainted by mistrust, doubt & fear. Communications come in the way of flowers, but even this is open to interpretation. Finally, she recognizes that running from love is not the answer. So we have also the languages of acceptance & forgiveness, which pave the way for peace &  family at last.
1400052173|2.0|If you are interested in genitics...okay, otherwise, I can't recommend this book. Very tedious and a little depressing reallly. Book club selection; some of the others liked it.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you enjoy Mahjong then you will love this free app.  With plenty of levels and variety from easy to difficult this is a winner.
B00683JK9K|2.0|I downloaded this as a FAOD despite the bad reviews the app already had. I played several puzzles in order to try different options and here's what I found.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&middot; Absolutely breathtaking images<br />&middot; Different levels of play, consisting of different sized pieces<br />&middot; Option to rotate pieces to increase difficulty<br />&middot; Sorting option in game play--allows just the edge pieces or all the pieces shown via toggle<br />&middot; Once pieces are successfully fitted, they move together<br />&middot; Clear, concise instructions on moving and rotating pieces<br /><br />Cons:<br />&middot; Pieces are sometimes difficult to grab<br />&middot; Pieces in Master mode are larger than the spots they fit<br />&middot; THERE ARE PIECES MISSING FROM THE PUZZLES<br /><br />Yes, the list of pros is longer than the cons, but the fact that the puzzles are incomplete due to missing pieces disappoints and brings the value of the app down to nil. It's like getting down to the last few pieces of a physical puzzle only to find one or two pieces were not in the box. Missing pieces sap the enjoyment from any puzzle. I'll watch for updates to this app, because I do enjoy puzzles, but this app has been uninstalled for the time being.<br /><br />Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;<br /><br />&middot;
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Though I really liked the first book in the Mortal Instruments series, [[ASIN:B005NDG846 City of Bones]], I actually thought that this sequel was even stronger! The plot here held a lot more twists and surprises and Clare provided even more detail into her unique supernatural world. The characters really developed more, too.The dialogue remained consistent, too, with plenty of that bickering, witty charm and humour - but the book felt less reliant on it this time. The major twist of the first book's central romance at first felt like the author turned into a corner that there was no escape from, but here she left a few hints that there may be a resolution after all... And a cliffhanger of an ending really made me thankful that the third book, [[ASIN:1416972250 City of Glass (Mortal Instruments)]], waits for me in my to-read-pile!<br /><br />Despite a few icky scenes, this YA novel felt really age-appropriate, but also very appealing to older readers as well. Very well done! And I can't wait to see where the series will go!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|EVERYONE GET THIS APP. it is so addicting. Ohh my gosh. I played for about 30 minutes that's how fun it is
B001NLL93W|4.0|The third book in the Mortal Instruments series really feels like a conclusion. It ends more satisfyingly than the previous volume, [[ASIN:B002VGTGHY City of Ashes ]] - that's for sure! But despite my satisfaction with the plot's threads being neatly woven together, I am even more curious about where the next book in the series, [[ASIN:B003V1WVH0 City of Fallen Angels]], will go! There aren't too many unanswered questions remaining, so the next book seems like it will really be more like a fresh start with these same lively characters. I really can't wait to see what happens next!<br /><br />Like the first book, the plot here follows some familiar paths, and it is a more predictable plot than its predecessor in the series. But it is still an exciting and fast-paced read. This is a strong YA series with lots of likable characters, funny dialogue and fascinating detail into a supernatural world that coexists with our own.  The central romance takes some darker turns than common in teen fiction, but it is well-handled. This is a wonderful series!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Couldn't put this down! I was more annoyed than usual that I had to go work! What a fanciful story with so many facets that were all tied up and explained at the end! Great book!
0143034901|4.0|Despite its slow start and its at times dragging middle, by the last page of this book, I realized how much I really enjoyed it. Though the book had some inconsistent pacing, it certainly evolved into a surprisingly thrilling and dramatic conclusion. The translation felt quite smooth, and the book had a very well-written quality to it that many translated novels lack. The 1930s and `40s Barcelona setting provided an excellent backdrop to the story, too. And the imagery of the actual Cemetery of Forgotten Books will be one that lingers in imaginations long after the last page of the novel. The characters weren't the most dynamic, and the main character, Daniel, seemed rather \\"blank\\". But, by the end, he really grew on me. The lively side characters (Fermin in particular), despite their often sexist remarks, had much more developed personalities. The enigma of Julian Carax made for both an interesting plot and character. It was definitely a book geared towards bibliophiles! But, ultimately, it did not quite live up to the hype it received. And though listed as the first book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books trilogy, it felt very complete, so I am quite curious to see where the next two books will go, or if it will be more of a loosely connected sort of series...
B002Q63JEU|5.0|Paramore was a great band until they lost the musicians who wrote their music! This was the last album I bought from them and I loved it!
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|One of my favorite TV series looks great on Blu-Ray.  Problem is that there is commentary on the first episode, but when the commentary is playing, the subtitles don't work, so you don't know what the actors are saying.  Subtitles work are fine if the commentary is off.  First time I've run into this problem on any DVD.<br /><br />Nevertheless, love the commentary by, among others, Ian Richardson.
B00AG6Z92C|2.0|This is a long anticipated but very disappointing release. Andrea's collaborations with David Foster have caused a gradual decline in the quality of his content and this album crosses the line from unfortunate to outright sad. Many of these tracks are little more than elevator music, and he deserves better choices and better producing. I hope he moves on quickly, before he loses his well earned international respect.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great book - the kids can't put it down.  More in the series to come to our house.  Excellent delivery.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and can't believe it's free!  My kids enjoy it also.  Not only do the images look real, it feels as though the horse and I really bond. This game is great if you want an animal but not all the responsibility that goes along with it.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I waited a long time before buying this CD as Bruce's last several efforts have been poorly produced and have each had only a couple good songs on them. Wrecking Ball has grown on me though. The songs have a passion in them that has been missing since The Rising. This is clearly Bruce's best since The Rising, and might even be better (ranking things like this isn't really sensible).<br /><br />Even though a couple of songs-- Wrecking Ball and Land of Hope & Dreams-- aren't new, this is the first time they have been on an official CD. The opening song is good (now that it's not being overplayed like it was last April) and Jack of all Trades grows on you .
B003FOFJAY|5.0|My daughter and I watch this amazing show.  It is OUR girl time together.  We both look forward to the next episodes.  Love those Gilmore Girls!!
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I think the book was very good, it was very intriguing and held my attention however I don't think the reasons for her suicide were accurate and not explained well enough. It's not very realistic reasons.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies because of it's moral value - not until he starts to think of others first does he get to go on to TOMORROW!
B00338QENI|5.0|This one also kept my attention!  I couldn't wait until the end to read the conclusion.  I would love to read more by Rebecca Skloot.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|This is the greatest Western movie ever made and I watch it at least once a year. I never get tired of it.
B00881PPTO|3.0|This app looks ok so far but I just got it and haven't had a chance to really use it yet.  But from what I did do, it seems decent.
B007WQYH4K|4.0|Accurate and follows the movie in order of play.  Best of the available soundtracks for &#34;Once Upon a Time in the West&#34;.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I'm sure there are plenty of song by song reviews since this came out awhile ago so I won't bother with that. I love this cd because she sings with such emotion. I even think her cover of \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" is great! I actually picked this up in store b/c it was on sale and I was there. So. lol. Anyways, to me, she's just one of those vocalists who could sing any song from any genre and sound amazing. I highly reccomend this CD. Lastly, although 21 is also awesome, I actually prefer 19 over it.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The title alone is very catchy.  It makes you wonder what it's about.  The flipping between the past and present adds a whole new twist very early on in the show.  This keeps you watching.  Great acting.  Wish I were that fit!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Excellent writting, wonderful acting, loved the story line.  Some of the green screens are a little obvious, but with this great a story, it's easy to overlook.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|Expecting a hilarious comedy mixed with some love...huge dissappointment.  Very boring.  The characters were poorly written and scripted.  A rather slow movie.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Julia and Richard were great together in this movie.  I bought this movie when it first came out on VHS.  I had never heard of Julia Roberts and had only seen Richard Gere on an Officer and A Gentleman, so I bought it on a whim and fell enlove with these two.  A hooker and a millionaire?  Who would have thought?  I loved her wittiness and he was a bit stuck up, but she loosened him quick enough and I saw the sparks flying.  I recommend this movie to all of the hopeless romantics like myself.
B005NFW0U0|3.0|Are the writers getting tired of this script?  It definietly shows!  This season was cut off too quickly and leaves the viewer with a lot of unfinished, loose ends.  Not as eventful as other seasons.  Probably because they turned Elena into a vampire and there isn't much of a story line to hang on to humanity.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Another movie for the hopeless romantics like myself.  Again I saw, a daddy's girl and a bad boy?  Who would have thought?  LOL.  Baby and Johnny were great together.  I loved the chemistry between them, especially that first night he had her on the dance floor, I cracked up.  The friendships and the loyalty between the other cast members were great as well.  Her dad got on my nerves a bit, but he was doing his job as a father and was desperately trying to keep Baby from getting hurt.  In the end Johnny went from &#34;bad boy&#34; to &#34;good guy&#34; and taught everybody that looked down on him a lesson on morals.  I love, love, love, love this movie.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love how Season 1 and 2 are so incredibly different.  It's nice to see the characters and storyline develop.  Lots of movement and progression in this show.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I don't know what that other guy is on but Gary is great!! What a refreshing take on blues, rock n' roll, and R&B. He makes a wonderful mix for me. I always love it when I hear a person who has the talent to mix the genres in such a way. Kinda like how Jimi Hendrix could do it. Right? You rarely get that kind of talent nowadays. I know this is the 21st century and Jimi is one of a kind and no one can take his place, but it's nice to hear a variation of that talent. I'm almost through all the samples and so far I'd say BUY IT! If you like Jimi Hendrix and John Legend with a little Cody ChesnuTT mixed in you'll love this album.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Well written.  Excellent execution on acting, singing and dancing.  This is a brilliant show.  I can't wait for the next season.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|He is a great Doctor.....wish it was for more than just one season!!  He had great chemistry with Rose!!  Don't get me wrong, 10 is my favorite Doctor, but 9 has a place in my heart!!
B008MIMWOO|4.0|I love these movies, I love them in Bluray, and I love getting all three for ten bucks more than you can imagine.  I do NOT love the fact that the disc case broke into several plastic-y bits the very first time I opened it.  However, this is my only discrepency.  Great buy otherwise!
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Bought this for my mother. Fast shipping, the DVD was not in the original shrink wrap but the DVD was sealed. No problems with the DVD itself it played well.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The films look great, and the box set deal for all of them at once is a steal.  Definitely recommended!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Something to read but not up to KF usual standard maybe he took a few days rest and caught up by filling the space with easy writing.
0761163808|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson. He is an animal lover. One day he said he never has anything for show n tell at school. When I ask why not, he said it has to be something fragile??? I got him this book and he took it for show n tell and said all his friends loved his book best. I was glad to see such a happy expression on his face. tks
B007SGLZP8|4.0|JG always writes page turner full of sub plots and keeps the reader interested Racketeer is one of these still worth reading
B004HHKFIY|5.0|Wooden railroads are great!  And, they are interchangeable.  Chuggington, Thomas and the others all work together.  My grandson loves the Chuggington Characters.  So, I bought a less expensive track set, and the Chuggington trains.  He loves it!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I thought it was good. I really enjoyed reading this book for my college English class. Over all I give it 3 stars
B00181MHQU|5.0|We watched it with a friend from Spain who fell in love with the music and the show.  Who can not appreciate the skill of Leonard Bernstein!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a cute game.  It starts easy and puzzling your way through the levels quickly gets harder.  Some of the levels took many tries to get the timing of using my tools just right, so it took me a longer time then usual to get through the whole game. Definitely worth my $0, and probably worth whatever nominal price you're looking to pay for it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great item. looks good and protects great.  I dropped my kindle to the cement and the case protected it perfectly.  Great style and function.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Works well, love that it works on my phone as well as my kindle.  Got the app and it access all my info anywhere... no problems here
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|My son was thrilled receiving this for Christmas. It is very well thought out and made like all Legos. Would recommend.

B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Great show, fun, sexy and smart.  Best comedy in years.  Season two is also great!! I can't wait to get that one as well.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|WATCH UNTIL...<br />The payoff at the end of the conference scene @ new job (20 min).<br /><br /> GROWTH?<br />One moment, the big one, at the end. The rest of the relationships are of the format:<br /><br />\\"Character_A [action] Character_B, then [new scene/next bullet point].\\"<br /><br />This isn't a story about characters maturing; it's about matured characters doing whatever they can do or want to do to meet their goals, and we start in the middle of action.<br /><br /> WILHELM SCREAM?<br />None detected. Hurray!<br /><br /> DUTCH ANGLES?<br />One. Commence sliding out of chair. The movie's light enough that seeing it (jarringly done) didn't pull me out of the story.<br /><br /> NO QUIBBLES<br />But a reflection: I think the mother scene was intended to help orient the protagonist's emotional state with backstory without further self-narration; however, the self-narration is so dominating and well-acted that the mother scene felt wonky. As it stands, the movie is an enjoyable length and feels snappy after the introduction.<br /><br /> HIGHLIGHTS<br />I enjoyed this action comedy. Mr. Ford's growl is beautiful. Ms. McAdam's portrayal of externalized mental tizzy (personal life) followed by coolheaded flow (work life) is fluid, and when the two are reversed, she causes me to root for her character. The supporting cast do their job WELL, creating the funny yet serious environment the main characters need to play off of.
B0097PW7H8|4.0|This app is great. It shows how long it will take to charge, plus ways to help conserve you battery strength.  Good deal.
1400067820|5.0|All the negative reviews seem to swirl around the bloated or weak nature of the concrete ideas. I'm sure he's open to attack here, variously. Taleb is strenuously exercising via arguments, using a massively entertaining series of analyses--almost all of which have considerable merit. And even practical applicability. And he's not boring. But he's all over the place, a little confusingly, and a little wonderfully, when you reflect. He's basically unchallenged by \\"real\\" intellectuals lately out of animal fear that they'll be humiliated in front of the tribe, which is saying something.<br /><br />In a real sense his Amazon critics are his most hated enemies--people with an academic bent who despise his overall style, or financial people looking for something \\"useful.\\" He's definitely actively hating on those people in his writing, which you rarely see with quasi-castrated tenured types, or the standardized editorial tone of NY \\"idea\\" publishing. Reminds me of H.L. Mencken and generally surly intellectuals of previous epochs, entertainingly.<br /><br />You can certainly argue with how his notions apply to real life, and get annoyed with him, but his digressions keep me awake, even if his ideas might be arguably \\"flawed.\\"<br /><br />Taleb's dismissal of Pinker's recent violence book was notably weak to me, though, since I'm a big fan of Pinker. Not sure how sighing in exasperation is an adequate response to 800 pages written by one of the smartest humans alive, but...hey. Pinker's analysis doesn't really fit into Taleb's concepts. Here you see Taleb might be ensconced in his own rectum, and he's no time, necessarily, to emerge to do rational or effective battle. Doesn't fit with his ebb and flow.<br /><br />5 stars anyway, all the other books are boring and without significance or original thought, mostly. I don't think I could recommend it more. It's a great reading experience, it's compulsive, funny and alive in ways most pseudo-systematic modern \\"idea\\" writing isn't.You might see serious flaws in his intellectual compulsions, but they're all intellectually-and-actually entertaining.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|It's no secret the Resident Evil movies are B level movies. But they are enjoyable to watch. . . for the most part. This one however, just sucks. Worst than usual acting, it's actually so bad my wife and I started laughing at some parts because the actors were so pathetic on screen. The FX are about the same as the other movies. Story line is almost non-existent and don't even get me started on some of the worst tactics I've ever seen in a firefight depicted on screen. Very cliche action sequences, boring camera work and lack luster music.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you're a fan of the series, sure, give this a shot. If not, don't bother. You're not missing out on anything. If I didn't know any better I would say this was some film grads first attempt to make a movie. IT&#34;S AWFUL!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|First of all let me say I am not a dissecting movie critic, I tell it the way it hits me and this movie had me smiling and humming music all day!  The storyline is collegiate students competing in regional accupella event.Even though I found the female co stars more enjoyable than the leading lady these musical college girls gave me more laughs than I have had in a week. The musical arrangements rocked me at the age of 65! Had to buy it on Amazon instant video.  If you can't get some type of feel good from this movie then you might need to see a priest for a church sanctioned ceremony. :)[[ASIN:B008JFUUIA Pitch Perfect]]
B000008OKV|5.0|I know this is an understatement, but a lot of people say there is only one or two good songs on this one,  I would say 4 or 5 good ones, and the &#34;filler&#34; aint bad either.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've seen it so many times, as musical, drama, TV and in film, parody and straight interpretation. But nothing beats the original. The ghosts are simply horrific, the mood spine tingling, magnificent. Dickens at his best.
B009X01ELC|4.0|I like this case because I can use it in portrait or landscape mode.  I found it easy to get my kindle in and have no problem rotating it for use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great read...couldn't put the book down at all! It's very romantic and has some fun and spice.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|As pretty as they come. This is a dark blue (almost black) and it shows off beautifully against the polished gold case. The brown leather strap adds the final touch. Very comfortable for a right hander since crown doesn't rub against the hand. So far, functions and accuracy are great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The last book of the trilogy. Loved all books. Has a great ending and I hate to say but I will miss the characters....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|what can I say I am hooked on this program. The cast is stellar. It somewhat reminds me of Upstairs Downstairs. Hope it continues for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I just got this game and I love it already. I've never taken care of a horse before but now if I ever do I'll know how to.
0765325950|5.0|A fitting end to an epic saga that began so many long years ago. Robert Jordan would've been proud of what Sanderson had done to finish it, were he alive to see.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought the book was very good. How it was based on a boy freshman year of high school. This book was perfect for me took read.
B009186JYI|5.0|If you ever wanted to see what being in a British invasion band was like,then watch this documentary featuring one of rock's finest bands the Rolling Stones!<br /><br />In this DVD,you'll see the band in its &#34;Satisfaction&#34; glory on tour and behind the scenes with Mick,Keith,Bill,Charlie and the late and uber talented Brian Jones whom is greatly missed by fans & peers alike. The picture & sound are crystal clear and the restoration DVD extra feature is also a gem to watch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It's absolutely amazing! Every sentence, page, and chapter made me want to keep reading and never stop! Peeta is a truly amazing character.he's everything a girl could ever want and he just completely makes the story :)
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is epic I'm already at the nether part I'm an 11 year old a<br />Nd I've been playing this since it came out.
1400067820|5.0|Great book. It is Nero Tulip at his best - honest, open, and easy to read. Most of all he tells one what it all means - how to live in a world we do not understand very well. It may be hard to swallow at time for slaves like myself - tie wearing office workers but such is life. Maybe a way to deal with it is to have a Stoic Johnny - a coffee shop dwelling flâneur alter ego? Taleb's trading alter ego - Fat Tony - dies at the end of the book. Curious what will Nero do with this $20 million gift  - finance an online University of Antifragile Life?
B003ELOQCA|5.0|u2 it`s an amazing group. This DVD is wonderfull. The recorded is very,very good, in sound and images. Put it  in a home teather and enjoy it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This DVD has been played over and over at home and in the RV. The sound and picture quality is great. Their performances are even greater. They have to share the DVD player with Joe Bonamassa, however!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This trilogy met my expectations. I liked it because it is rich in special effects, the cast is very good and the struggle to fight power's seduction is shown very vividly.
B00417HV14|5.0|We play this DVD at least twice a week and when we go RVing with our son, we play it twice a night. He is fantastic, what more can I say.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book and have read it several times now! Can't wait for the new one!!!! Keep it up
B004J88SGC|4.0|The sound quality was fantastic. The image was very clear. One thing I didn't like was one of the songs, Captain Jack...it was not for innocent ears. He also used some language children have heard, but I didn't like it during the show.
B000JLPMPS|5.0|How can anyone not like this movie?  it sums up all the cowboy movies he did in the past.  Clint is the man
B0074JODP8|4.0|The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that we also bought Joe at Royal Albert Hall, which I would give 5 stars. His voice and guitar playing leaves no doubt he's the best. No wonder he opened for BB King twenty years ago.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|I was entertained, but for some reason Jennifer Lawrence really annoyed me in this movie.  She seems to lack emotion in this movie and other movies.  Surprise ending tho, but basically the same type of movie about the odd neighbors next door.  Not that scary either.
B0009WFFS6|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because the first song was really not that good. It used to be my favorite back in the day. As they moved along, I loved all the rest. It is much cheaper if you buy Blu Ray, but at the time we didn't have a Blu Ray player at home, only in the RV.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|As always Will Smith had me laughing out loud.  Entertaining movie, better than I expected.  I really enjoyed the ending.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Kept me turning the pages.  A little too much medical jargon, but it wasn't that distracting.  All-in-all, a good read.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Let's see. One of the most enchanting reads I've had for a long time. Wonderful story and writing. Thoroughly recommended. If it gets made into a film, please don't spoil it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful series,  must see!!  The plot is intertaining and the characters are portrayed by superb actors!
B003JRD5JO|5.0|I downloaded this on my kindle fire, I love Bon Jovi hits and listening to them on my kindle fire...
B004QYTRRS|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but it was very predictable. I kept hoping that I hadn't pegged it from the very beginning... but, I had. Good acting, good story and I still enjoyed it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|When I would download it and exit the game back to my home page it would be gone and I would have t o re buy it and trust me I would not delete a 7 dollar game which is a stupid price but I guess the people are stupid so listen to me if you download this it will be gone when you exit the game
B004N8CP8K|5.0|This is one of most important App I need to have. It allow me to connect from Android or Kindle HD to my workstation. It's too bad VPN on Kindle HD does not work. But I can connect when using it within company WIFI. Thanks a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The producers were thinking how to make it better as you can see.Bless there souls!You can't say is sucks you just can't.I'll tell yow that games can be horrible. We all know it too.But this rocks.It's like the Brave version but free and better! Get it! You won't regret it!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|The movie featured some great themes and interesting characters. I definitely recommend watching this movie; it's safe to watch with a family as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think sub way surfers is a cool game and that a lot of kids would enjoy Subway Surfers and it is just a fun game to play so I think everyone should ho to the app store and get sub way surfers and the other good thing is that it is free so this awesome game for only 0.00so get it now
1451695187|4.0|I'm so happy that Dr. Eben lived through this horrible illness so that he could share his experience while not in this world.  4 stars because there were just moments when it was painfully angst-ridden to have my fingertips reaching for this reality and<br />putting the book down and not being as sure of the possibility of this outcome for myself.  I did asking my husbnad if he thought we had to take our life baggage with us into this heaven or if we had to go in with all of our remaining  lissues.  Courage to live it, write it and to read the book.  May his colleagues own up to what they see in their practices.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I loved it it was fantastic! I would recommend it to anyone who can read! I loved scrooges transformation in charles dickens words
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I love this book.  I re-read it at least yearly.  I can't wait until Gaiman releases the next installment of this wonderful story.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Just finished reading this book and I really loved it. The way Jay Asher wrote this was a really good way to get the reader to pay more attention for details. I could not put this book down because it was such a good book. Recommend for anyone who likes books that aren't in the usual format.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love the Harry Bosch series.  This novel keeps the series fresh and relevant.  Connelly keeps the characters consistent and you get drawn into their lives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fantastic it's so addicting and the updates are great plus its free. Definitely a app worth anybody's time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A terrific read! It keeps you guessing throughout the book up until the dramatic twist at the end! A must read!
B007REV4YI|5.0|It will no doubt reveal my age when I state that I read Ian Fleming before any movie was ever made. I have enjoyed every film, the good and the bad and have always been fascinated how the Bond films reflect changes in both film making and popular culture.  Sometimes, though rarely, The James Bond of film was close to the image that Ian Fleming had in mind when he wrote the original books back in the 1950's and 1960's based on his own experiences during the Second World War and his own personal demons. Sean Connery's early portrayal and the 2 films starring Timothy Dalton came closest to the original character of our violent and troubled super spy and assassin. The world was apparently not ready for the grim reality of  the literary James Bond and preferred the light hearted spy fantasies of the films with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan.  Then came Daniel Craig and the conscious decision by the producers to bring back the James Bond of Ian Fleming's novels. 'Casino Royale' and it's extension 'Quantum of Solace' began the transition successfully. Now we finally have the third film with Daniel Craig and the transition is complete.<br /><br />'Skyfall' is the first James Bond film that can stand on its own independently of the rest of the series. It is a true thriller in the British tradition of  espionage thrillers that go back over 100 years in English thriller novels.  It is no doubt the best film made yet to capture the essence of Ian Fleming's original intent. It will disappoint some who wanted more action, more sexual double entendres, and more humor, but it will please many who have longed for a film that captures the original character and the narrative flow of many of Ian Fleming's novels. Fleming's intent was to recreate the British espionage thriller. 'Skyfall' fulfills that promise in film.<br /><br />Buyers should be aware that this first release of 'Skyfall' is a bare-bones disk and it will be awhile before we get the followup 2 or 3 disc release with allthe commentary and bonus features. Personally I am not falling for the studio's get-rich-quick DVD release and will wait for the complete release which I understand will be released in the UK the same day that this abbreviated release set is planned for the USA.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon had it wrong in its description of the Blu-Ray. The 2-disc Blu-ray does indeed include commentary and a few extras. The second disc contains digital copies of the film. Unfortunately, the extras are not complete and another release is probably in the future. I hope that it will include the new 1 1/2 hour documentary 'Everything or Nothing'
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. When I saw that it was Stephen King, I was unsure of what to expect. However, it was a wonderfully, imaginative love story, set against the historical fictional background of a tragic American event. A must read.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Such a great read!  The author has a great talent for blurring the line between fantasy and reality.  I find myself hanging on his every word as if these events have actually happened.  That's a sign of a great writer :)
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I've used this book for lessons in my classroom, and it's so interesting to me that I've read it for my own personal enjoyment and information as well.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is an awesome seriies.  I have finished the first book and am now viewing the first year of the series.  It is amazing to see the characters come to life.  Read the book first though.  The book is magical and is written so that you can see everything that is happening.  Each chapter is written from a different character's perspective so that you see things from different angles.  What a great way to pass time in the deep freeze of winter.  to quote from the book:  &#34;Winter is coming&#34;  so read this book.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|An absolutely enjoyable tale that really will get the imagination of your kids going wild. I certainly enjoyed it as an adult and recommend it to all.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Witty, well-written and acted and a really good story.  Such a nice change from the usual pap.  Nice surprise ending.
B005LAIISU|4.0|It was good but again the series is getting a little tired. It is good to Scrat getting much more face time. I think he's the best squirrel around.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Best of the three Batman movies.  Filled with fantastic special effects, good story and great acting.  The ending is superb and leaves plenty of room for future adventures.
B000007XUQ|5.0|This album was everything I was expecting it to be.  I had heard from others that it is really good, and they were right.  I have always been a Carpenters fan.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Well-written series with twists and turns.  Excellent acting and superbly intereresting episodes.  Because it is on cable tv there is a little more explicit sex that I feel is necessary, but I can easily fast forward through that and get back to the great story.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|If you are a fan, you don't need me to tell you about this CD.  It is a must have.  My kids keep running off with this CD, so I had to reorder another one.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|Beautifully acted and such a different type of story.  Still not sure if it was partly sci-fi, or just an amazing imagination of the author.
B004DMZ3QM|4.0|My son loves Legos. He completed this in about 3 hours and was already looking for his next project. Boys!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show just improves with the seasons and that is saying a lot!  I haven't laughed like this in years.  If you have never watched The Big Bang Theory you are in for a treat!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|There is so much on this site to see. I never get bored when I'm on Pinterest. Love the concept.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! For one thing the price is great. free! plus it doesn't take long to save up coins. ive had this app for about a month and I already have four characters. Defiantly an app to buy!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I am totally addicted to this game. This is officially my favorite game of all time. I love this game soooo much.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the Downton Abbey series, and season 2 was not available on Netflix, so I decided to buy it. Season 2 does not disappoint
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Awesome game. Very enjoyable. Just wish my touch screen would work properly, though. I highly recommend getting it. Would still be worth downloading if I had to pay for it.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This is one of the greatest series that HBO ever created.<br />All the characters are so intriguing and hateful in the same time. If you haven't seen it before, you are missing out.<br />I can't wait for the second season to come out and the third one to start in march in HBO!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Got to get the game! You will enjoy playing it. Hurry download it! Have the best time ever.. this crazy review will not let me go until I write 29 words od more.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|I am not your typical gamer.I am in my late fifties.The Kindle Fire is not the greatest platform to play games on.This game may make me become a gamer on my Kindle Fire ! It is a Blast to play.Not to difficult to learn.The only suggestion I would make is the game needs some kind of control sensitivity adjustment setting.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I read all the Sherlock Holmes stories as a teenager and they have only improved with age! In the era of DNA testing, CSI, luminol testing for blood spatter, and internet searches, this compendium is a charming and beautifully written reminder of a bygone era. Tracking down villains with cold logic, deduction and references to tools of detection such as Sherlock Holmes' study of the various characteristics of cigar ash,  make for absorbing and exciting reading. A reminder too of an age when trains and horse drawn cabs were the only modes of transport, telegrams did the work of mobile phones, the dividing lines between the working and priveleged classes where clear and indelible, and the gallows worked overtime. A wonderful read.
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Four singers who look like they are having a wonderful time. I bought this because I was familiar with Netrebko. I found three more wonderful singers. Being sort of new to opera, I had not heard some of these pieces before, but enjoyed them immensely. The 'Lakme' duet was gorgeous! The ladies voices blended beautifully. I had not heard of Tezier before, but he has a great voice. It isn't as full as Hvorostovsky or Terfel, but it is expressive with a good range. The solo from Don Carlo was beautiful, and I liked it better than the version I have by Hvorostosky.<br />The encores show the fun all of the performers were having. I think the first violin had an unforgettable time. Netrebko kicking off her shoes and dancing; Garanca flirting with the audience, and Tezier's 'Toreador&#34; all make it one of my favorite dvds.
0812993292|5.0|Excellent story.  Even though I bought this book I chose to listen to it on CD where I feel the experience is richer. A wonderful story for all time.
B005X5XIL0|4.0|This is good, just not great. Andrea good as always, but I would have preferred more classical and less 'pop'. The Orchestra was great, as were the guests, and the photography as well. I just prefer to have either a classical or a 'pop' program. I have two other other Bocelli programs that are single-themed, and love them. One of the tings that I wish they would do on these videos is put a notation with the title of the piece of music. Some pieces are easily recognizable, some are not.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked on this series.  From the outside scenery to the inside, the characters are realistic, fun, quirky and extremely enjoyable.
B003VYAX2W|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it! Great transaction, fast shipping! He has been enjoying rocking out to this great CD! :)
B00139XSBA|5.0|Detailed account of the entry of the US into the space race from the earliest efforts to select astronauts (who were only expected to be human cannonballs, not pilots),up to the multiple orbit missions by single pilots.  The personal stories and personalities of the original astronauts are woven into the efforts to create a capsule that could be successfully launched as the US scrambled to catch the Soviets.  I would read it again.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|My husband was sooo excited to get this for Christmas!! He is a big Rage fan and he couldn't be more happier rocking out in his car with this!!!! :) This was a great transaction, fast shipping!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love this case.  I had the Kindle leather case for my Kindle Fire, and it worked fine, but it was much heavier and clunkier to use than this nice light and lovely case.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This thermal compound does the job. It provides for a lot of uses and allows my CPU to run cool.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B0043VDIAG|5.0|What can I say about this book except WOW! This book is written extremely well. The story captivates you from the very beginning and you fall in love with our lovely skittish Katie. The characters are believable,, the storyline is relatable to so many woman. This story is a touching one if grief, fear, abuse and anxiety not to mention loneliness and how amongst it all two broken spirits are able to find each other and heal together as a family with two mall children by their side. DONT FORGET THAT THE MOVIE BASED ON THIS BOOK PREMIRES IN CINEMAS ON VLENTINES DAY 2013
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun but it might be a little bit slow at times but overall it is a really good/awesome!
0060557818|4.0|I literally just wanted to keep reading this book, and once I was done my mind sort of wandered inside the world Gaiman created. All of the characters and relationships are well fleshed out, but not in a way that lets the story drag. Gaiman is a truly unique story teller, he imagines a whole world that's sort of Mary Poppins on an acid trip during a monty python skit. Comparing this book to anything does it a disservice, truly original, exciting and fun. Read this and know pure joy.
1416562605|5.0|I read this book while traveling in India and it really helped open my eyes to a lot of things about the caste system. Not only was it enlightening and educational, it is sharply written and laugh out loud funny at times. As the reader, you really get to know 'Balram' and his life as he fights hard to move up in the chaotic, strange world of class systems, social politics and community. A very good read indeed. I look forward to reading Aravind Adiga's other books.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|We are huge disney fans, and my husband had not seen this one yet. I saw it in high school and loved it. Especially for all of the Elvis Music. Great movie , love it!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Funny movie and light hearted for kids. my kids loved it, I would reccomend it to all my friends and family
B000003S5H|5.0|Excellent music. If you like their music you will not be disappointed with this CD.  They are truly artistic.  Sorry they broke up.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|love it-the acting is awesome - the idea is appealing ...it's great great great. Make one want to go to india
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the book and the rest of them. I really enjoyed reading them. I thought it was a good read and couldnt put them down. The story is really good would read again.
B00304RMFE|5.0|After watching my sons play the game for years, it was just a fun to watch them watch and react to the movie!
B001Q9J4PG|4.0|I had already this book twice, but I wanted it stored in my Kindle.  Just like other Clancy books it is filled with more detail, plots and stories than any other author I know.  I like the book because of the John Kelly, formerly John Clarke character and his sidekick Ding.  It has so much action, suspense and intrigue it is hard to put down.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The first time I ordered this I received the 8 film collection except the DVD that was supposed to be &#34;The Prisoner of Azakaban&#34; and so labeled was actually a completely different movie when I put the DVD in to play it. I was actually the Polar Express. So, I contacted Amazon, then sent me out a new collection and it had the same problem!!!
B005I3PAUO|5.0|I have read 21 books by Baldacci & all of them have been great books to read.  This one has a new character to be the hero.  I am retired & living in the country of Panama and I purchase my books through Kindle.  I have to be very selective on the books I read because of the cost.  I liked this book because it is a new main character.  The main character is very likeable.  The story was one that kept me going and it did not take long to read because I had trouble putting the book down.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This collection of music was a very good selection for Susan.  I loved so many of the songs, however, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, certainly did not do justice to her style.  Otherwise, I liked the CD.
B007L24T52|5.0|This book was really great.  It is another new character by Baldacci.  I read this book in one day.  I could not put it down.  The story was great and I hope there is another book in the future with this character.  He is a hitman taking out enemies of the USA.  After several hits he has trouble pulling the trigger and then the thrills and suspense really start.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The premise for the story was interesting, especially in developing the ironic turns in the story.  But the story in and of itself was a bit over done.  The murder of Desi, which Amy called &#34;an isolated incident&#34; was not in keeping with the rehabilitated Amy who by the end of the story is to become a mother.  That weakness in the plot structure took away from the climax of the novel.
0765325950|5.0|A fitting end to the series. It will make you laugh out loud and make you cry as well. The story flows well and the battles are fantastic. I enjoyed every chapter of this monster of a book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is like so totally awesome! there's ziplines and fire! you should like get this it is so awesome!! :)
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Love this cd.  Like the title says, my daughter calls this &#34;farmer music&#34;, but she's two.  We listen to it in the car a lot and I think it's growing on her. I'm sold.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting book basically confirming my belief in reincarnation and the everlasting existence of our soul and God's unconditional love.
1607066017|5.0|I gave this graphic novel as a gift after hearing rave reviews on a blog I follow for offbeat families.  I thought my friend would like it (she loves comics and graphic novels as well as sci-fi) but I wasn't sure if she would be interested in the plot, as it has a lot to do with families/children/procreating and she is single...but she says she loved it and wants to read the rest of the series, so it must have been good!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|bad movie; skipped and was disappointed for the price even. LOVE the movie; hated the problem that came with it. AH
B002RT85RW|4.0|These are great disks for the price. I have burnt on two of them, and no issues. The burning speed is slow, but I think this is standard with blu ray. I would buy them again.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I just love this book series.  I am going through each one right after another and each one is betteer than the one before!
1433502410|5.0|I am really enjoying this Study bible--excellent notes making it easy to understand.  I would recommend this Bible to anyone who wants to dig deeper.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I love this series of books!  The characters are great and the stories great.  I can't wait to bet to the next.  Each is more exciting than the previous!
B003RRY60S|5.0|Reads just like an episode of Dr. Who. Quick read and lots of fun and suspense! Any fan of the 10th Doctor is sure to enjoy this adventure. :-)
0887307280|5.0|I'm a solo entrepreneur and I'm finding it hard to take my business to next level. This book clearly showed the problems I'm facing and what I have to do to overcome by problems.<br /><br />Concept of the book is very simple - You can't run a business by working in the company to do all the technical work.<br /><br />Business need to have 2 different kind of person to make it successful - Entrepreneur, Manager and Worker. Most entrepreneurs try to get into entrepreneurship and end up doing the technical work.<br /><br />I learned exactly how to differentiate these 3 roles, hire right person and develop the business.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a beautiful story, with a twist that you would never expect, I loved every minute of this book
B007THA4FI|2.0|I really didnt like it at all. I stopped readying into the 3rd chapter. I just couldnt get into it. I was reading it and it was so confusing and the story didnt make sense to me. I read all of her Harry Potter books and they were really awesome. I just think she missed the mark on this one.
