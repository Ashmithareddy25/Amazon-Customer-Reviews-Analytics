B00004THDI|5.0|Many of the reviews here have called this the best soundtrack. I heartily agree. The music is outstanding and really fits the grandeur of the American West. It's very much an epic score. I just finished watching the film \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and was inspired to buy the soundtrack.

B0018AT890|5.0|This is easily the best of the Harry Potter soundtracks. It resembles classical music, with \\"magical\\" twists. I particularly like the Aunt Marge's Waltz (track 2). If you only get one Harry Potter soundtrack, get this one.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Well if your reading this review you must Love David Gilmour and the things he is capable of.  Just listen to Echoes the Acoustic version,  the guitar solo is mind blowing and that alone makes it worth the doe.  He lives up to his name several times throughout the DVD.
B0008ENICU|2.0|I remember looking forward to seeing this movie.  It boasts an all-female cast, (was it in this version, or in the newer one, that there WERE some males in bit parts?), and was called \\"THE WOMEN\\", so it would, I hoped, give breath and life to what women really want and think about. Which -- in my opinion at least --are mostly the very same things men want and think about: food, clothing, shelter, love, achievement, advancement, success in financial and personal realms, the fulfilment of talents, and the enjoyment of being with friends and relatives.....just to name a few.    Well, I suppose I should have expected what this movie had, from the time period in which it was made.  Still, not-so-closet feminist that I am, I was REALLY disappointed in this movie. It was mainly about, (if I remember correctly), one woman's knowledge of her husband's affair, and not wanting \\"the other woman\\", (a close friend), to know that she knew this.  I am ALL for the institution of marriage, and also ALL for divorce, if things sadly don't work out, and the marriage only serves to make each person in it miserable...but this movie was only full of catty conversations, (clever and witty though they are), and women talking about marriages that go apart, and being nasty to one another.  There is one little girl in this movie, and I remember clearly being sorry for her: I mean, is THIS all she has to look foreward to, as she grows older?    If I don't remember much of the plot, I suppose this is psychological  elf-preservation on my part.  Little -- if anything -- is mentioned about \\"The Women\\"'s careers, if, that is, any of them have them.  Their main concern, (and career), seems to be holding on to, or seeking out, husbands whether they love them or not.  There is precious little, (if any), friendship between these women -- just clever, catty conversation.  Famous REAL women -- such as Muriel Siebert, Marie Curie, Madeline Albright, Eleanor Roosevelt, Meryl Streep, or even Queen ElizabethII -- would find little to be comfortaable with, amongst the sly, manipulative, malicious, mean,  and secretive women characters in this movie.    I suppose, during the time this play was written, that such \\"husband-hunting\\", and \\"husband-keeping\\" were all of the \\"careers\\" that were open to women.  No -- wait a minute!  Even then, women could be secretaries, teachers, and nurses.  There were also many women who wrote both fiction and non-fiction.  Women painters and pianists.  Women who played other instruments in the orchestra -- and even women who composed music that other people played!  There were also, then, (and now!), men and women who really did love each other, and who had long and successful, (and happy!), marriages.  Men and women who respected each other, too.  But here, even women don't resepct each other!    It is also interesting to note that the novels of Georgette Heyer -- which were set in Regency England, a long time BEFORE the period during which \\"The Women\\" takes place, and a period in which women had even fewer rights than they did in the 1930s and 1940s -- still portray women with higher regard for themselves, and others, than the argumntative and sneaky women in \\"The Women\\".  Why?  Because the characters in Gerogette Heyer's Regency novels all have SELF-RESPECT.  Putting down others is NOT their primary goal, in and of itself.  No, they will NOT let others take advantage of them -- but Georgette Heyer's women characters are more interested in accomplishing their goals, than in putting other people down.  While trying to achieve THEIR ends, Ms. Heyer's characters ALWAYS have SELF-respect upper-most in their minds.    Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote, (paraphrased), that \\"happy families are all alike, and therefore, boring.  It is the unhappy families which are interesting....\\"  I have always felt Dostoyevsky wrong here -- and the movie, (and play), \\"The Women\\" proves it. Here, we see that it is the UNHAPPY families that, if not all alike, (no mentionof loving families where there is sickness and/or poverty is present -- or cam these actually be happy -- ie, loving -- families, upon whom sad times have come?), are greatly similar. Mainly, they have UNloving, catty, malicious, husband-hunting and husband-keeping females in them, to whom just BEING married is the most important thing -- with or, (as here), usually without love.  But there ARE differences in HAPPY families.  To give an example from TV families: the families on \\"Family Ties\\", \\"Father Knows Best\\", \\"Empty Nest\\", \\"McMillian and Wife\\", and \\"That Girl\\" have family members who are all (basically), happy in each other's company -- but are all vastly, vastly different.    I cannot understand why ANYONE would enjoy watching \\"The Women\\". It has SO many female stereotypes in it that it makes me, (also a woman), squirm in the greatest of disocmfort.  I imagine that any man with an ounce of respect, (or at least, curiousity), about women, watching this movie, would say to himself: \\"Is THIS all I have to look forward to, when I get married?\\"    No, dear sir, fortunately, it is not.  Women are, when one gets right down to it, just fellow(?) human beings.  Women may have SOME proclivities that men do not, (and vice versa) -- but these are very, very minimal.  All human beings, as I mentioned at the start of this review, basically want the same things.  Amongst these, (which I neglected to mention at the beginning...but did touch on later), is RESPECT.  Mutual respect between human beings -- whether between men and men, women and women, or men and women -- fulfills the basic human need to think to one's self: \\"I am important in this world.  I have worth!\\"  The stereotyped \\"women\\", in the movie and play, \\"The Women\\", have just about no self-respect.  Nor do they respect others.  They are shallow, one-dimensional characters.  Why is \\"The Women\\" considered a classic?  I don't know.  And I think I never shall.
B000002UAX|5.0|I was a little late getting around to buying this album. I went to every store in town trying to find it with no luck. I decided to look online and take a chance for it to be delivered before Christmas. I got it with a few days to spare! The CD was new and sounds great. He loved it!
B000W9399S|4.0|The circles I run in have been touting the merits of Terry Pratchett for as long as I can remember.  I've always enjoyed well written fantasy having read many of the standards in the genre, but for some reason I just haven't \\"gotten around\\" to Pratchett's Discworld.<br /><br />Having the Kindle now removed one of the barriers (cost and convenience) and so I went ahead and searched out what was the first book in the series, downloaded it and read it.<br /><br />All in all, I had a little difficulty entering into the flow of the novel.  The writing was strong and very humorous in places.  I had difficulty however, in following some of the plot and transitions which were just a little too random and disjointed for my taste.  A little investigation led me to discover that this is not an unusual first response to this series and that later editions of this book in hard-copy come with a map and with some supporting material to help provide some better contextual overview than what the text by itself does.<br /><br />As good fantasy usually does, there are strong anchor points within the book that tie back to our more mundane and predictable world.  The characters are well developed and cast more in the light of anti-hero which provides for plenty of irony, dry humor, sarcasm and puns, which brings the book into line with other strong offerings in this genre such as Adams, Anthony and Asprin.<br /><br />All in all, I'm inclined to go further in this series in the belief that the quality will stay the same or improve and that the elements that felt confusing on this pass through will clarify.<br /><br />I think however, that based on my experience and the observation of others, that I'd recommend that this book be purchased in hard-copy and not on the Kindle for those who want to enter into the experience more fully with the additional resources that the Kindle does not have.<br /><br />4 Stars.  5 for the story, 3 for the Kindle version and splitting the difference.<br /><br />bart breen

0684824906|4.0|In \\"Team of Rivals:  The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,\\" historian Doris Kearns Goodwin justifies yet another Lincoln book with her argument that Lincoln deftly and aptly out-maneuvered his rivals in the 1860 Republican convention before co-opting them into his cabinet.  I started the book with high expectations, believing it would be penetrating political science or at the very least a study on management.  Instead, it was a long ponderous book that lacked focus, and I was quickly swamped by the author's slow rendering of overwhelming detail.    This year is 2010, and reading Goodwin's book it becomes obvious yet startling that American politics 150 years was completely different.  The three main rivals who gathered in Chicago to compete for the presidential nomination of the newly formed Republican party all came from different backgrounds.  Henry Seward was a New York aristocrat, Salmon Chase was the son of a wealthy man who lost everything and had to re-build against many obstacles, and Abraham Lincoln came from nothing.  Yet these three politicians - like most of their contemporaries - had courage and conviction, purpose and drive.  These were educated, literate, and noble men who would more often than not put aside their ego for the good of the nation that they so proudly believed in and so dearly loved.  Of all these noble and great men, Abraham Lincoln was simply nobler and greater who thrown into the most turbulent and dangerous of times rose to the occasion.  And from noble and great men who passionately hated slavery and loved their country before they loved themselves how hard was it really for Lincoln to assemble a competent team and temper his rivals?    And there was a long section in the book in which I couldn't help but wonder if Lincoln's gift for compromise and tolerance, for understanding and empathy did not lead to the unfortunate deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.  The North was an industrial power that had a greater populationand far more firearms than the South, and under a general who was less cowardly, less incompetent, and less egotistical than General McClellan (which is to say just about anybody) the North could have easily overwhelmed the South and brought the rebellion to a quick and relativley painless end.  Nevertheless, in the face of overwhelming evidence of McClellan's insubordination and sabotage, Lincoln still wavered as to whether to replace McClellan, prompting Lincoln's own cabinet to take action.  Lincoln's indecisiveness and McClellan's dithering emboldened the South, creating a momentum that would sustain the South for four more years than was necessary.     Goodwin continually hammers home the point that Lincoln was a political genius, but was he a political genius or did he possessed an incredible amount of empathy that sprung from the wells of his impoverished background and his depression?  Surprisingly, what Goodwin pays scant attention to throughout her book is that what has made Lincoln the quintessential American hero was his rhetorical and literary skills that created a national narrative that became the American religion of today.  The Founding Fathers with their constitutional compromises on slavery would set the conditions to tear the country apart, and Lincoln would spin a myth of America that would slowly heal the wounds when the country did in fact tear apart.  More than anything else Lincoln was a literary genius, and in this way he will forever remain the true father of America today.
B0033B5XCS|1.0|Unless the original Nightmare on Elm Street box set is going out of print then don't bother with this set. No improvements on this set but comes out in time to cash in on the remake of the original Nightmare on Elm Street. It takes out the Nightmare Encyclopedia, which is well worth checking out, and replaces it with the subpar Freddy VS Jason. Didn't they just re-release these movies in a four pack anyways? Save your money and either buy the 4 Film Favorites dvds which includes all 8 films but way cheaper (and probably what this set consist of) or buy the original set for basically the same price and get the cool Nightmare Encyclopeida, it's your money.

0712610111|5.0|I won't bother to review the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", just this particular edition.  It's lovely!

The binding is a handsome print on fabric.  Lovely book.

0451228731|4.0|By definition, a 'Daemon' is a computer program that runs in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user; they are usually initiated as background processes.  In Daniel Suarez's debut novel, the Daemon that threatens world domination is the creation of a Bill Gates-like wunderking named Matthew Sobol whose dying act is to release his Daemon upon the world and bring it to its' knees.    Filled with so much realism it will make you take pause at the concept that something like this may already be happening and could be the cause of the current global economic crisis.  A team of agents and government types from many different areas of the country try to combat the Daemon - all in vain.  Sobol's Daemon has a slew of human assistants --- various loser, hackers and wannabes --- who are easy lure for this evil program to use as unwitting pawns to do its bidding.    The novel took a little time to get goint - but once it starts rolling hang on tight.  The door is left wide open at the end for the upcoming sequel, \\"Freedom\\".  Can't wait for it!

B00002E224|5.0|This movie is perfect. Romance movies, are normally terrible, they are cheesy, unrealistic, and in no way show what relationships are really like. This movie, is nothing like that, it is quite possibly the best romance movie ever(its sequel being strong competition) and needs to be seen, not just by people who like love stories, but by people that hate love stories. If your a hopeless romantic, you will love this movie, if your a cynic when it comes too love you will love this movie for completely different reasons, but no matter who you are you will love this movie.  A must buy.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Like this seaon very much. Want to know how it will end with Dean. Probably fine because there is a season 4.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|More a relationship comedy than a romantic comedy, this story of unrequited love is hilarious, artsy, down-to-earth and thought-provoking all at onece. The cinematography is sweeping at times, and the acting feels real. Summer's (Zooey Deschanel) breezy friends-with-benefits relationship with love-struck Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) made me wonder which part I played in some of my own relationships.   Cleverly playful dialogue by Writer Michael Webber and Co-Writer Scott Newstator.   Highly recommended.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I have seen this movie a few times with my wife and while I don't have to make over dramatized gag motions I certainly don't look forward to seeing it.  While the twist of an Irish side to the movie does add some changes to what could be a fairly cliche storyline I am not amazed.  The acting is well done and the storyline does follow a consistent path, mainly humor is the key in this flick.  There are several awkward situations of laughter that bring this closer to enjoyable.  It is not a bad movie but it's just not my personal choice, it would seem to be one of the better films in this genre.  But for those of us who have to see these it is a welcome change to not be getting elbowed in the ribs by our significant other as we have to poke fun after each less than clever line.

At the end of the movie they show a recap of filmed locations along with the city, state or country. The filming is breath taking and looks great on our HD TV. It is also available on blu-ray! There are lessons to be learned in this film. What happens to our planet depends on the choices we make as individuals every day.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I saw \\"Avatar\\" in 3D on the giant screen in a packed Imax theater. It's a very good movie though not a great one. The special effects are sensational, of the knock-your-socks off variety, and go beyond anything that's been done before in film, particularly the depiction of the Na'vi people and its creation of entirely new strange animal creatures, and the views of an alternative nature with floating mountains and colossal trees as big as cities.<br /> The movie, after the great scenes of Marine corporal Jake Sully's indoctrination into the natural world of the planet Pandora and into the Na'vi tribe, resorts to the usual film hoakiness and clich&eacute;s. Briefly it even resembled a Tarzan movie.<br />It's very violent, in the tradition of the action blockbuster genre. It turns into another gruesome war, battle and combat movie. The battle scenes are really horrifying and no different than the century old cowboys versus Indians baloney, except this time the Indians are mounted on strange creatures.<br />Instead of blazing new territories of content Cameron is mining all the old stereotypes and reliving the past. Will movies never grow up? Technically and in terms of eye-popping effects they have surely progressed, but the violent content remains, and we have to ask ourselves why?<br /> I think Cameron underestimates the intelligence and tastes of audiences today. To some extent a movie maker should be breaking new ground not only technically but in terms of sensitivity and morality. The film could have gone in another more pacific direction and not catered to the baser emotions and the vicarious thrills of watching senseless violence.<br />How could the movie have gone in another direction? Signoney Weaver in one scene talks about the trees on the planet Pandora that can communicate with each other on the entire planet by means of their root system. Why not have the roots of these trees underneath the alien military base uproot and destroy the perimeter of the base and the base itself and avoid the heart-wrenching combat scenes?<br />The war whoops and cries for revenge and violence from both sides seemed all too familiar. Cameron was showing how indigenous peoples have been wiped out, and he was also perhaps trying to show the futility of war, but he did so without offering alternative actions.<br />Because of its great technical leaps forward this movie deserves to be seen and acclaimed. Cameron has taken a giant leap forward for moviemakers and audiences.avoid the heart-wrenching combat scenes?

B002P5XXR0|4.0|For a film like Avatar, very \\"different\\" in its overall qualities, an equally alien score is needed. In this way, I think James Horner has succeeded. Much of the music sounds very different from the standard movie soundtrack, and most of it has a tribal feel to it that helps to create the culture depicted in the film. In the epic places of the film, there are also epic elements of music. In the more spiritual scenes of the film, the music matches the same feeling. That said, there are two qualities missing from this score that keep my rating lower than I would have liked it. First, the themes used (\\"tribal\\" for lack of a better word, and the heavy brass for the human faction) are extremely subtle. While I appreciate the moving away from a two anthem score, it is almost too much and there is little to grasp on. Second, I find the entire soundtrack generic in terms of itself. If I were to play the album on shuffle, I wouldn't be able to tell a piece from the beginning of the film from the end (with the exception of \\"You Don't Dream in Cryo\\", which has the missing definition).When listening to a soundtrack, I would like to be able to recall the scene in my mind. Fortunately, the track titles provide the missing information.    A much better score than many films recently released, but still missing elements that would make it perfect. A fan of the film would find the soundtrack worth purchasing.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I grew up watching the ORIGINAL \\"Star Trek.\\"  Though I couldn't quote by stardate, I knew the name before the initial credits.  As a sci-fi movie this is good.  As a pre-quel to \\"Star Trek,\\" it is disappointing.  From the young Kirk being able to drive a stick shift car (couldn't in \\"A Piece of the Action\\") to the sexual attraction between Spock and Uhura, to Christopher Pike being in command of the USS Enterprise for a very short time, there are just too many inconsistencies for a true \\"Trekkie\\" to take this film seriously.  I liked the nod to the characters, but the writers, producers, and director of this film did not respect the millions of fans of this iconic television series.

B002I6251G|4.0|Editors' 2005 debut album \\"The Back Room\\" was one of the most accomplished debut albums of the past decade (I call it the UK's answer to Interpol's stellar debut album). The 2007 album \\"An End Has A Start\\" had some good songs on it but overall flet like a rehash of the debut album's musical ideas, and not nearly as good. THat left the band with a dilemma on what to do next. Having seen the fork in the road, the band apparently decided to take a decided left turn, and emerges with a new sound.<br /><br />\\"In The Light and On The Evening\\" (9 tracks; 43 min.) couldn't sound any different than the first two albums. The electric guitars have essentially been abandoned altogether, and instead a synthesizer sound (not unlike, say, Ultravox 25 years ago) is front and center. Check out the dark title track that opens the album. \\"Bricks and Mortar\\" (2nd UK single) and \\"Papillion\\" (1st UK single) follow in order. It's hard to see the commercial appeal of those songs, but as compared to the other songs on here, they are the 'catchiest' tracks on here. This is a mood album, pure and simple, and if you're in the proper mood, this will sound great. If you're looking for another serving of \\"The Back Room\\", you're going to be mightily disappointed, so, truly, buyer beware.<br /><br />I've seen Editors in concert a number of times in support of their first two albums, and singer Tom Smith always gives his 110%, whether he's playing guitsr or piano, seemingly getting lost in a world of his own. It will be very interesting to find out how the new songs will be brought live (I guess guitar-player Chris Urbanowicz will switch to keyboards?). Can't wait to see those guys again. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear Editors, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none, and where this album has been played regularly since its UK release in October 2009 (the US release is January 12, 2010, with 5 bonus tracks to boot).oot).
B000E1ZBH2|3.0|I bought this movie because I love Jane Austen's stories and I loved the 1995 version with Colin Firthe. I had seen this movie previously and had enjoyed it enough. It is a good summary for the story, but I would not recommend setting your heart on it as the best. I do love Keira Knightley's acting and I felt she played Elizabeth Bennet rather well in this movie. However, as a Jane Austen classic, this is not the best. I would definitely recommend the 1995 mini-series first, but seeing as that one is 310 minutes long, this one will work for your Jane Austen 'fix'. =)<br />[[ASIN:B00005MP58 Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E, 1996)]]

B00288KNL8|5.0|I loved this movie. My six-year-old, on the other hand...not so much. I think it definitely has more of an appeal to the Tim Burton-loving fans (even though I'm pretty sure this wasn't directed by or produced by him). It was a creepy movie and I would definitely recommend looking at the other reviews and maybe even imdb.com for more information if you plan on allowing your child to watch it. LOVED the music!
B00003CX5P|3.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Admittedly, I was a child of the first Star Wars Generation and spoiled by the uniform brilliance of what has since become known as the Original Trilogy.  Even when I watch these frustratingly altered movies as an adult, I am reminded in spades that it wasn't simply the uncritical eye of a child that led me to adore them.  They were and are genuinely groundbreaking science fiction films deservedly remembered as some of the best ever made.  I say all of this to illustrate the unavoidable fact that \\"Star Wars Episode I-The Phantom Menace\\" does not even approach its tremendous predecessors(or sequels, depending on how one prefers to look at it).<br /><br />It's not that it doesn't try.  George Lucas has cast some of the finest actors and most interesting character actors working today.  Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Ray Park and Pernilla August all appear in this movie.  Unfortunately, though, they all give uncharacteristically lackluster performances and seem lost amid an oversized world of stars, planets and spaceships.  This is also the first \\"Star Wars\\" movie which feels like it drags its two and a half hour runtime very slowly.<br /><br />There were two huge faults in this movie, and they are both character-related.  The first is Jar Jar Binks, an upright alien rabbit with floppy ears which gets very old very quickly.  The second is the execution of the boy Anakin Skywalker.  Jake Lloyd is a terrible choice to play the pre-Darth Vader, but I think a bigger miscalculation is in not giving the character a hint of darkness to foreshadow the future.<br /><br />This may seem extreme, but I was very mildly depressed the first time I saw this movie.  A piece of my childhood innocence was gone, and I saw more and more of the faults of \\"Star Wars.\\"  Nevertheless, while time has cooled that initial reaction, I can still only give this film a mild endorsement.
1401323820|5.0|Great read, like a '40's detective novel.  I for one hope they produce more of the editions from the t.v. show.  Loved it.
0399250395|4.0|I love this book so very much.  Perfect gift.  This version is the pop out version (i.e. it is big) so just keep that in mind.  They sell smaller books.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I ordered three videos from this same seller. The items arrived promptly and in great condition. My only negative feedback is that I ordered three videos and had to pay shipping for each individual item even though they arrived in the same package. It would be great to receive a multiple item discount.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I loved this album as a schoolkid when it first came out, and having just listened to it again I'm glad to find that I love it just as much today.  There's something so visceral, lyrically haunting and timelessly RIGHT about it, never mind the fact that it's depressing.    But it seems the depressing aspect was terribly off-putting to many reviewers.  This makes no sense.  Some of the world's finest art is depressing.  And if ever a Pink Floyd album could be called art, this is it. Raw, yet coherent. Angry, yet sublime. A Momentary Lapse of Reason is a shambling, shallow thing, offering just a faint echo of Pink Floyd in their heyday.  How it can get the same rating as The Final Cut is totally beyond me.    And let's not forget the incredible production standards.  There's a reason why people take a CD of The Final Cut with them when they go out to buy audio equipment.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this with my family. It gives quite a thought provoking account of some of the most critical moments in our nation's early history. You may very well be tempted to buy additional copies for family and friends!
B001E95ZHY|5.0|The Rocker DVD was purchased from Amazon as a Christmas gift.  I was willing to give it as a Birthday gift if it didn't arrive on time for Christmas.  Much to my delight it arrived early and was available for a surprising and well liked Christmas gift.  My son was thrilled with it.  After all is that not what Christmas is about, the thrill on a person's face when they open a gift.  Thank You.
0307237699|1.0|I read this book while Emperor Obama was a candidate. I am glad that I waited to review the book until Obama was president. The book is very slick and articulate and intelligent with lots of great ideas and ideals. I am seriously wondering if it was ghost-written now, because I don't think that he is really that intelligent. I was duped into voting for the guy too. I would rather have voted for Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich, but that option never presented itself due to the powers that be. Obama is obviously the property of the Bilderbergers and others who would destroy our country.  This wonderful Constitutional \\"expert\\" is more of an expert at destroying the Constitution. Obviously, Obama, the candidate, and Obama, the president, are two different people. Is he a liar or a schizophrenic? You decide! Don't waste your time reading this book or listening to what this puppet of the New World Order is expounding. The only hope we have is that our system really works, and he is impeached before further damage is done to our great republic. Also, I find it very ironic that the title for this book came from a quote by Reverend Jeremiah Wright, someone who Obama threw under the bus a long time ago. His association with Wright became problematic during his campaign, so he was jettisoned like so much baggage. I suspect this is a common ploy of Obama's - use people until they are no longer useful.
031606792X|5.0|WOW!!!!!!  I have to say, I was not a fan of Twilight at all. I didn't know what all the hype was about. Finally, I broke down and watched the movie!!! WOW!!!! Totally a surprise.     After watching the movie, I learned that it was a series and that there were books...not only that, I didn't have to wait years for the sequels, they were all finished. I'm an avid reader anyway, so I immediately went out and bought Twilight. I finished it, it was great. The next two novels just weren't as good, (as you can see I am not a Jacob fan) I was totally rooting for Edward!     I patiently read the first three books. I could hardly stand the anticipation for Breaking Dawn, the final read, silently hoping that Bella picked Edward! So I thought I would read some reviews, hoping that it wouldn't give too much away and ruin the book.    Upon seeing the \\"one-star\\" reviews, I thought, \\"Oh NO! She doesn't go for Edward\\", just assuming they were all Edward fans too. I immediately stopped reading the reviews, I just knew it wasn't going to end well.    So I totally braced myself. I started reading Breaking Dawn, preparing myself for the worst...but it NEVER came. EVERYTHING happened how I, or any Edward/Twilight fan, should've wanted it too!    I couldn't have been more surprised. I don't know what all the fuss was about. I just wanted the series to keep going. It was great, although it drug out in the 2nd & 3rd books, but in the end she's with Edward, no one dies, they have a happy family.     It was GREAT!!!    PS: Wish she could've finished Midnight Sun!!!
B00284BNKC|5.0|Darren Aronofsky's film, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, is one of my favorite all time films. Not only is it visually stunning--making use of clever editing and fliming techniques like split-screens and special effects--the story is one that will stay with you for a long time. Although the movie will leave you breathless and coming away with that feeling of \\"damn, that was a good movie,\\" it's not for the faint-of-heart.<br /><br />The movie is aptly named as the story follows a mother and her son, both on parallel tracks into drug addiction, and his best friend and girlfriend, and how their dreams disintegrate with the passing seasons. All four characters descend into the depths of hell, making choices they wouldn't otherwise make, just to score some dope.<br /><br />Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly, and the fantastic Ellen Burstyn give outstanding performances. Why this film didn't sweep the Academy Awards is beyond me.<br /><br />I wasn't going to buy it on Blu-Ray, because I already have the DVD version, but since it was on sale here on Amazon, I couldn't resist.<br /><br />I'm so glad I got the Blu-Ray edition. The transfer looks great and the scenes are even more horrific in 1080P.<br /><br />Unfortunately there aren't any extra features on the Blu-Ray other than the ones that came on the DVD Edition. In fact, the 05:35-minute Sundance Featurette \\"Anatomy Of A Scene,\\" where Aronofsky describes the shooting techniques in the film, is missing. Not sure why it was left off.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:<br /><br />*** Commentary by Aronofsky and DP (Director of Photography) Matthew Libatique<br /><br />*** \\"The Making Of Requiem For A Dream\\" 35:23-minute documentary--showing footage of filming behind the scenes and Aronofsky comments on what is going on. Very informative and you get to see all the work that went into this film including the make-up prosthetics that Burstyn had to wear.<br /><br />*** \\"Memories, Dreams and Addictions\\" 19:56-minute interview-- Ellen Burstyn interviews Hubert Selby, Jr. who wrote the book [[ASIN:1560252480 Requiem for a Dream: A Novel]].<br /><br />*** Deleted Scenes--many various deleted scenes with optional commentary.<br /><br />*** TV Spots & TrailersSIN:1560252480 Requiem for a Dream: A Novel]].    *** Deleted Scenes--many various deleted scenes with optional commentary.    *** TV Spots & Trailers
B002UXRH10|5.0|Finally, Rihanna is back!!! She has come back with a different sound, but it is even better than before. She took a risk by throwing a rock-ish sound out there and she succeeded! She has an edge that shows she is a powerful singer! Everyone should buy this!
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Take the Story of The Last Samuari or Dances With Wolves move it to the future add some excellent CGI and make it 3D for good measure and you have this movie.  This time around the Earth is a dying planet and a group of scientists and military are interested in a specific mineral (maybe dilithium crystals?) from the planet of the Navi.  They are a large humanoid species that live in a ecological system where all forms of life seem to be connected to each other and everyone worships a tree God called Awai.<br /><br />One of the soldiers is selected for a mission (because his twin brother has died) to use an Avatar (a part human part Navi body) because he has similar DNA to his brother.  The soldier is crippled so when he links with the avatar his brain transfers to the avatar and he can do whatever the avatar can do, which includes walking.  He is told that he has three months to infiltrate the Navis and send back useful information to the military and scientists so they can get the needed mineral supply.<br /><br />Like in the other mentioned films, the more he lives among them he starts shifing his allegience to them.  Eventually, he has tough decisions to make.<br /><br />The movie is one of the best science fiction films I have seen for all the aspects combined make up a total movie that is excellent.  The movie has a running time of about three hours which for someone as old as me is a little too long to wear those 3D glasses (I started getting a small headache by the end).  It is definately worth seeing in 3D though because you can appreciate the level of detail of the CGI.
0778321606|5.0|The Shop on Blossom Street is truly a unique and interesting story with compelling wonderful characters.  The main character Lydia who has survived cancer twice follows her dream and desire to reaffirm her life by opening a knitting store.  She sinks her entire savings into it.  Soon she meets three new friends; each with their own challenges.  Jacqueline has a marriage she needs to save.  Carol cannot get pregnant and desperately wants a child.  And Alix a mixed up teenager has trouble with the law and life in general.  It is remarkable how each woman life is changed for the better.

B002Q9MZF6|3.0|I love this video as an audio recording.  I generally get tired of Boheme because it is played so much and sometimes I force myself to listen to it too often because every time I turn around, another of my favorite singers has been recorded in it, so I feel I must experience it again.  This time, I did not get tired of the music or the singing.  It is wonderful to have as an audio recording, but so far, I have not gotten through the thing visually because the close-ups really put me off.  Also the acting is so over-the-top -  fine for on stage, but in a film, I find it macabre.  I saw many good things, particularly in the settings and the timing of the direction, but the close-ups and constant movement of the camera annoyed me, until I had to turn the video part off and just listen whilst doing something else.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a must have!  Read it before the movie comes out.  My favorite part about this book is that it teaches you so much about Greek history and mythology. Percy Jackson all the way!
B002VKE1K2|1.0|The story is about a couple who start to deal with haunted occurances in their own house.  The female part of the couple thinks that spirits are following her from her childhood.    The problem with this film is that nothing happens!!!  It's 86 minutes of total boredom and I fell asleep three times while trying to watch it.  Nothing happens during the first hour and then the last 20 minutes it gets slighty scarey, but by this point nobody cares because we're so annoyed by how bad the movie is that I'm just waiting for it to end.  Also, the lead female part of the couple is a annoying ugly woman who just whines and crabs throughout the whole movie.  By the end, you just want the spirits to take her soul and be done with it.  All of the movie is filmed in the same house, so one gets very tired of shots of their ugly hard wood floor.  There really isn't anything bad about this movie, it just has no substance, no suspence, no story, no music and no magic.  It really needs some Hollywood magic.      I can't understand why so many people went to the theaters to see this yawn inducing bore.  Even bad Hollywood horror movies provide gore and cheap scares, this movie gives us nothing.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|For a dog lover, like me, the cover first of all looks like beautiful. What can I say more? Norah, every time you get better and better! Congratulations, again!
B001PPLIFU|4.0|This movie picks up right after \\"Casino Royale\\" and much like most sequels, it is more action and less substance.  It is different from the previous movie partly because there is a new director at the helm.  The Blu-ray looked good for the most part, and there are a few extras that's worth looking at.  If you are a true Bond fan, then you will eventually get this.  Otherwise, wait till is around $12 then it might be worth it.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I just bought these from Amazon a week ago and I LOVE THEM. My gaming ability improved 10 fold. You can hear someone walking around you and I do mean around, you can tell if their behind, or the rear right, or just the right. They aren't lying when they say 7.1. These are by far the best headset I've ever used. And just so you know I've bought different pair for chating on the pc for my hubby while he's in Iraq and I got to try those too, Ear Force Z1, (cause he uses them for music and gaming on pc) they are fantastic as well. Bose ain't got nothin' on these guys :)
0670021652|5.0|As a newlywed and someone who is constantly seeking more knowledge/expertise regarding love, marriage, and life, I found Elizabeth Gilbert's new book THOROUGHLY enjoyable. The cadence of her paragraphs on the history of marriage and its traditions/evolution over the centuries flows beautifully, which makes it easy to \\"sit in\\" on her brief \\"class\\" and learn as one does from the best of professors. And, of course, her humor and honesty regarding her personal story makes you feel as if you're traveling along her journeys with her.    I highly recommend this book!
B001S86J1C|4.0|As a movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off needs no presentation, is a classic! It was great see again this wonderfull movie. Altough, the extras could be a little better. Maybe the fact that in the 80's they didn't expect to insert this extras in the VHS's didn't help. The quality of the image and sound is great. Overall, a great Blu-ray and a wonderfull deal.
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thornbirds is one of my favorite novels; I have read and re-read it multiple times. The book is a love story, a family story, a life story.  It is a tragic story that does end on a hopeful note.  It is a \\"must read!\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was surprised at what a wonderful CD this was.  Excellent music, songs were wonderful and originally presented.  Great CD!
B000ZECQ08|5.0|When this sixth HP movie came out in theaters, I saw it in the 3D version. It was good, no issues. When I watched it on DVD the only issue I had was that most of the scenes, especially the action ones, were dark, i.e. night or in none illuminated places. I had to turn off all of my lights and close the window blinds and curtains to bring out the characters and scenery in those dark scenes.<br /><br />As to the content of the movie, it was and will be the darkest of the HP series. There are one or two liberties taken by the screen adaptation that deviated from the story line and may affect the final movies unless some magical type explanation is brought forth.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie. Not my favorite of the series but true enough to the book to be lauded as more than abdicate.
B002TUU4EG|5.0|That dvd was given as a gift. She said she really liked it and made a comment about the bag which she really liked too.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter is about Zach, a guy who just graduated high school and now is at a crossroads for his future. For a long time, he's been a father figure for his nephew, Cody, and he's been trying to be a good boyfriend for his on-again, off-again girlfriend. Meanwhile, he really wants to break free from it all and pursue his dream of becoming an artist. To make things even more confusing, he discovers he is gay when he begins hanging out with his friend's older brother.<br /><br />Shelter is a wonderful movie because it's not just a \\"gay movie.\\" Zach being gay is only one of the beautifully interwoven conflicts of this movie, not the only one. In addition, the intimate scenes are done tastefully and are not hardcore (which might be a detriment to some, but I think it helps preserve the art-like feel to it). It seems to me to be very realistic and enjoyable to watch. One minor thing which may be a problem for some is that there is quite a bit of swearing. Not a big deal for me, personally, but something that may bother others.<br /><br />I'd recommend buying this movie because it has definite replay value and I'd suggest anyone watch it, not just LGBT supporters.

B000JQUMPI|4.0|Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video.  My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it.  AS FOR  THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years.  All the universal themes of family togetherness  (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced.  I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading.  Free on Kindle -- so Kindle readers, download and enjoy this enduring American classic.  Not just for children or for girls; I'm a 61-year-old man!
B002QH2NUA|4.0|the TV special didn't do justice to this concert. Wait till you watch the DVD of the live concert! Hard to imagine he's 65-what energy. This one's fun to listen to in the car and at work. Prepare to Rock Out!
0307454541|1.0|This author and this series is one of the WORST I've attempted to read in a long time. I like to read books of substance which is why I avoid romance and \\"fluff\\" novels. However that is all this is. The author goes into so much unnecessary detail the book should be a third the length. Yeah we get it, this woman is disturbed and \\"badass\\" and the guy is \\"ladies man\\" who gets all the women. And yet the author continues to pound this into the ground. The second and third installments are just as bad with ridiculous, tawdry sex scenes involving a 16 year old boy and insignificant details about Salinger's \\"tasteful breast implants.\\" Give me a break! If I want to lose brain cells I'll read a Judy Blume book. The \\"twisted plot\\" is hardly interesting enough to make up for all the garbage in these books. If you are used to reading mindless romance novels then these may be a step up for you otherwise do NOT waste your time. Please I beg of you read an intellectually stimulating and interesting book.... i.e. The Red Tent or The Handmaid's Tale... Life is too short to waste on this uneducated author and his useless literature.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|This is an excellent cable.  If you have any doubt about whether to dish out $25-$50 for a 'quality' cable, forget it.<br /><br />If you really want to be a sucker-buy the Monster cable or any other &lt;9' $10+ HDMI cable.  It will be your loss.<br /><br />I should go in to the HDMI cable business.  I bet Best Buy is making a fortune on their brands (Amazon is doing it too by the way, with their 'premium cables')<br /><br />Seriously, you wont notice any difference in picture quality between this cable and the over-priced 'elite' shielded cables.<br /><br />Plus, Amazon provides a super reliable warranty - in case your kid gets scissor happy or lightning strikes your Blu-Ray player.

B001ADPMQS|5.0|This is an amazing movie, the best Christmas movie ever, so pleased with the shipping and the packaging. A+++
0930289234|5.0|This is the first comic book/graphic novel that I have ever read. And I was not disappointed. The storytelling of Alan Moore and artwork of Dave Gibbons make for an amazing piece of art. I am very much a \\"visual\\" learner and the added visual stimulation, as opposed to the traditional written story-telling, helped me enjoy it all the more.<br /><br />This is a complex, inter-woven story covering the many different lives, perspectives, and relationships of the Crimebusters, a group of costumed do-gooders who are in search of a mask-killer. There is an ominous presence looming overhead throughout the book. What really made this present was the foreshadowing, used to describe the flaws of a hopeless society through hatred, war, and fighting in the streets. Then there are also moments of promise for the world, when small characters go out of their way to do the right thing by just caring for others around them. By the end of the book, we see that people are forced to come together as a result of a tragedy (think post-9/11).<br /><br />If you loved the movie, you will love the book even more!

0805091742|5.0|Atul Gawande is perhaps the most prolific patient safety advocate in our country.  Using his own experiences to highlight the need for changes in our healthcare system takes courage few physicians would have.<br />He shows how using simple checklists in operating rooms routinely saves lives and avoids complications.  And he shows us the resistance the medical profession has to implementing them.<br />My one unfulfilled wish about this book was that it would have been useful for Dr. Gawande to include an appendix with the surgical checklist written out, along with the statistical results that using it has achieved, so readers could send it to their local hospitals.<br />If anyone is interested, the links to the checklist and the results  from using in eight diverse hospitals around the world, can be found by going to google and typing in \\"who surgery safety checklist\\".  I included the links in my review, but for reasons unknown to me, Amazon removed them.
B000001GQP|5.0|I know I'm new to Carmina Burana and have only recently started listening to this lively, rhythmic cantata. However, after comparing different interpretations by borrowing CDs from the library, I think this is still the most satisfying, gutsy and punchy recording of the work currently available.    In my comments I don't think I can add much to the laudatory reviews already posted. It would still be a marvellous rendition even if Orff didn't authorise it. But perhaps it's due to the crisp, rhythmic and gutsy singing and playing from all levels. Jochum presides over a gutsy, incisive performance and the orchestra and chorus give their all when they perform the piece. I think he is a good judge of tempi in this piece, brisk but not rushed like an F1 Ferrari.    He has a superb trio of soloists at his disposal. I think that Fischer-Dieskau acquits himself admirably in his many solos. He sounds rough and coarse during his two solos in th In Taberna section, and sounds suitably gruff in the Abbot's song. Elsewhere he is his old lieder-singing self in his solos, in Omnia Sol temperat and also in Circa mea pectora. Gerhart Stolze gives one of the best renditions of the Roasted Swan song. It sounds effortless and suitably mock-tragic, and his falsetto makes it just right. Janowitz also does superbly in her solos, most notably in In trutina. Elsewhere the chorus handles the varying moods of the piece and performs their parts with aplomb.    It's remarkable that this version has held up well since it was first released. And I think the current DG Originals remaster makes it sound better than ever, even better than the previous DG Galleria CD. However, I would confess that I own the Japanese Universal SHM-CD (Super High Material CD) issue of this recording, and the SHM-CD does more justice to the recording. I think it makes the instruments and voices sound clearer and more defined than this regular CD. But then that issue would cost the earth if you were to try and find it onHMV Japan.    In short, I think this Carmina Burana recording is a rather unbeatable version that has held up well in spite of the competition. I think it caters to the varying moods of this lively cantata and I think it's one of the best-balanced versions. No doubt there are other excellent recordings available but I think this is one of the most enduring recordings currently available.
B002DA3KXY|5.0|I am so glad that The Geurnsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society was my January book club pick. To be honest I probably would have never given this book a chance otherwise and it was an amazing story of survival, friendship and love that kept me reading late into the night.<br /><br />Juliet has so much such spunk and wit that I instantly fell in love with her spirit. But then I was are introduced to the wonderful cast of characters from the island of Guernsey and I was pulled right into their lives.<br /><br />One thing about The Geurnsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society that I wasn't expecting was that the book is told entirely by letters. At first I was disappointed by this because I've read a couple of books that are written the same way and some of the text can seem to be added just as more content but with The Geurnsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society every word is meaningful and I can't see reading this book any other way. I highly recommend this one for anyone who loves a touching story of endurance and triumph in difficult times.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|American on Purpose seems to be a carthartic exercise for the late-night funnyman (though that is the last thing he thought he would be doing early in life).  Ferguson is adept at delivering his autobiography at a brisk pace despite some pretty heavy topics - alcoholism, drug abuse, adultery, divorce, parenthood, and death - just to name a few, though not always in that order.  The book probably is not always as \\"funny ha-ha\\" as one may expect from a guy who has strayed wackily, and hiliariously, from the the traditional late-night script.  Ferguson intended this to be introspective.  He succeeds.  He very candidly delivers the reader through the darkest points of his life to some of his later triumphs.  He does justice to every topic; yet he is not so beholden to one theme or event that the reader is forced to endure minutiae of material that strays from the theme.  He expresses his point, and he moves on.  His attitude seems to be, in essence, \\"Yeah, some of this stuff happened.  And, it really sucked.  But, I am better now and here's why.\\"  And, once in while he is pretty funny while saying it.  Fans and non-fans will should the ride.
B002IYEQR4|3.0|I think Warner may have pulled the plug on the quantity pressed of the Ultimate cut since they already were saturated in two versions of the DVD, a Blu-Ray Director's cut, a Blu-Ray video game with the film in the package, the Black Freighter in both formats, and a video motion comic. Phew! They also gave it a list price that would milk every last cent out of only the diehard fanboys who held out to the end or had to have it to own every version.     But will I buy this one just to see the Black Freighter cut into the film? I think the high cost after seeing the IMAX showing and buying the Blu-Ray, the Game (w/Movie) and the Black Freighter disc is the dealbreaker on this one. I can just pop in the Black Freighter DVD when I know where to cut it in myself. Sorry, Zack, maybe when it shows up on the Goldbox Deals page at half off!
B001QOGYFY|3.0|I am a big fan of Beckinsale so this was a tough review to write, but I suppose this was an even tougher film to sit through.<br /><br />The story follows a US Marshall in Antarctica as she leads an investigation into murder, betrayal and a 50-year old Russian mystery cargo crashed into the ice. I have screened it in the store for a couple days now and most of the feedback centers around all of the weather mistakes and bad CGI clarity on the BD. Has not been a self-promoter so it is not being shown anymore. The picture clarity is decent during the non-motion interior shots, but the majority of movement scenes are either out of focus or non-reference. The exterior CGI scenes (almost all of them outside of the several flying scenes) have prevalent green-screen lines and the lighting makes for an obvious stage set. Try not to look in any of the goggles because they usually give away most scenes (sun reflections during whiteouts, etc.) and try to ignore the makers' attempts at keeping the audience aware of Kate's face in the snow (one scene shows hot coffee instantly freezing but she can keep her face unprotected in the same whiteout/scene for a few minutes). The TrueHD gets used intermittently during wind storms and the one crash sequence shootout and landing. The supplements are average and include:<br /><br />* Coldest Thriller Ever, 12:02 minutes. Covers the filming locale in Canada and how cold it was on set. Kate looked beautiful in her interviews, was almost a before/after contrast between the film and here.<br />* Storyboard to screen, 12:05 minutes. Not a fan of this one but if you like the board docus you will dig this.<br />* Deleted scenes, totals 4:14 minutes. Would have helped with two of the 40 plot holes this film had, especially at the Russian Base and her day to day investigations she talked about.<br />* Disc 2 is the Dig Copy, for Windows and Mac (except in Mexico)..?<br /><br />Not a recommendation for Blu or for the movie, and being there are only three or four points of landscape clarity - could only give this a few stars.larity - could only give this a few stars.

B0029LHW4U|2.0|I have to admit I wasen't sure about an Alice In Chains album without Layne.  That being said I figured I'd at least give it a chance. I'm currently listening to this album as I write this.     One thing I enjoy about AIC is that every album, even the acoustic ep's sound different.   I was really hoping this one would have a unique sound, all its own.  Unfortunately it doesn't.  I can definately see why people say this is another Jerry Cantrell solo album, and if it were it'd be a pretty good one.  It does sound like Degradation Trip to me.  I thought that album was ok, but he's already done that before.  It's time to move on to something new.    The song quality is ok.  There's not a really bad song, but there's not a really good song either.  They're mostly just ok, and after a few listens I still can't remember any of the songs, except Check My Brain and A Looking In View.  Also these songs are way too slow, and there aren't enough fast paced rockers for my liking.  Most of these songs drone on way too long.  Don't get me wrong, I like long songs, but not songs that are five minutes plus just for the sake of being five plus minutes long.    With repeated listening I think they'l grow on me, but in order to do that, there's got to be a couple of songs, that do something right away to make me want to keep listening.  Those songs aren't here.    The album opens up with All Secrets Known, which while an ok song is what I feared from the album.  It's slow and plodding, and doesn't really do anything for me.  Then we have Check My Brain.  This song has solid music, great vocals, even if a little simple, but the lyrics.  I can't say I know them all, but California?  Just having that state mentioned bugs the crap out of me.  Still it's a decent song, but to quote Local H \\"Please no more California songs, and f--k New York too.\\"  Last Of My Kind is next, and I can actually tell the new vocalist on this one.  It's an ok song, and I think it'll grow on me, but if this is how he sounds I don't understand why he was hired to replace Layne.  I know he's got to use his own style, and I was very curious to hear it, especially after hearingothers say how good of a job he does covering the old material, but this style just doesn't fit what I think of as Alice In Chains style.  Your Decision is a standard ballad.  It's ok.  The guitars remind me of a much lesser version of Anthrax's Bare, great song you should check out.  Also if you're unfamilliar with the band definately check them out too.  Next we have A Looking In View, which has a good chorus.  Unfortunately the song drags on way too long, and it's another slow and plodding song.  I'm really not a fan of this pace for a song.  When The Sun Rose Again is next, and I really hope this one grows on me, because I like the sound of it.  Next we have Acid Bubble, and this one drags on and on.  The new vocalist bugs me in this one.  He didn't sound that bad earlier on the album, and the song seems to never end.  It's slow and plodding, and if it were a four minute song, it might have been ok, very Degradation Trip.  Then we get Lesson Learned.  This one's more up-tempo, finally.  Unfortunately it lacks any sort of punch.  Take Her Out is a mid-tempo song, which makes it one of the faster ones on here.  Again no punch.  Private Hell is another rediculously slow song, that doesn't compell me at all.  The album ends with the title track.  I had heard they were going to use a piano on a song on here, so I was very curious.  It wasen't as unique as I wanted, but it still turned out to be different for them.  The song itself is only ok, but at least it sounds heartfelt.  This is another one I really want to like more, and hopefully I will.(to add to this review, this song actually did really grow on me.  My only complaint now is that it's too short.  I'd like to have had at least an instrumental break and third chorus, but a bridge and third verse would've been welcome too.  Either way I now really like this one.)    Overall it's an ok album.  In time it could definately grow on me, but unfortunately it doesn''t really give me any reason to.  Still if you like Alice In Chains, or Jerry's solo work, definately check it out.

0307389839|5.0|It is well written, you get a glimpse of mind of a runner.  Haruki Murakami is a popular novelist, I thought only in Japan, but apparently even in US he is well read by young people. I mainly bought it when the title of \\"--- running\\" caught my eyes. I don't run and never intend to do it. But I have a close friend who is an enthusiastic runner trying to enter \\"marathon event\\" in every continent. There is full of philosophy not only of running but about life.

B002QW7AJY|5.0|I usually do not go for the creature films but this sci-fi roped me in right away with another great performance by Foster, the standard from Quaid, and even a nice break-out showing by that OC/Twilight alum Gigandet. They postponed this title for a month for a variety of reasons and customers have been requesting it since November, and I think most will not be disappointed with what the Blu has to offer.<br /><br />The picture clarity gets some valid tests intermittently, with the majority of the film taking place in dark corridors and an overall dank ship, your black level/display is hopefully tuned ideal for this. There are only four scenes of brightness, and the final end sequence did not use the best effects so the shortcomings show more than desired, but the creatures (Winston's group I believe) looked great with those fluorescent spikes not drowning the line definition at all. The sound was a mixed bag, at times an outstanding reference for True HD with the cavern-type mix to outright screamings through the center channel. I counted only three times that dialogue was drowned out by a poor mix, and with how they overamped the high pitch I could not turn up the sound much past a normal level. The supplements are also a mixed wish list, including:<br /><br />* Deleted scenes, 28 minutes. This includes an alternate ending which would help answer the nagging questions about who does what in the ship. Some alternate versions of the same scenes, usually just some added dialogue quips, albeit there is one perverse scene that was sick. Worth the watch if you are a fan of the film.<br />* World of Elysium, 14 minutes. A clip-heavy promo piece that covers set design and a few facets about working for the director.<br />* Nadia's team, 4:10 minutes. A completely forgettable Quarantine/Blair Witch clip about some crew members who record their last moments aboard the ship before being eaten - lame.<br />* Flight Team Training Video, 2:45 minutes. Felt like a Starship Troopers type ad film, except for this version of reality.<br />* Picture galleries, four total with roughly 100 pics/storyboards. You have to really like the storyboard thing here, there are a few nice pics of the set though.<br />* Disc 2 is the Dig Copy, Windows only.<br />* Commentary by Alvert and Bolt, technical heavy.<br /><br />Spanish audio, English and Spanish subs only. I enjoyed the premise and the execution of what the film became. It does not provide all of the answers desired, but Foster is fun to watch and the idea of how it ends is inspiring, could make a great follow-up film.

My husband who NEVER reads a book has read it twice already and we recently purchased another one for a family member who he thought would really benefit from the information.  I still have not had a chance to read it because he had it in his hand whenever I saw him sit down.  That alone should tell you something about how good the information is in the book.  In fact, my husband used a highlighter for the points he wanted to find at a glance.  I can't wait to get my chance to read it.
B001AQMBJQ|3.0|I love Lost, I love this season, but the packaging and menu's are kinda screwy.    Why can't I get a \\"play all\\" button?  I hate having to select the next episode.  Maybe its just the blu-ray, but this whole \\"season view\\" or whatever it's called is driving me nuts.  I want to put the disc in, play all episodes, take the disc out.  Less menu interaction please!    The trays the discs sit in for the Blu Ray edition has cracks and what looks like melted holes in some spots.
0810982862|1.0|There were a fleet of concept artists who worked on this film, and my hope was that this book would contain a lush group of sketches, matte paintings, concept designs and 3d models along with a commentary on the creative process and perhaps some insight into the process of translating acting directly into character movement and expression. Instead, low resolution images fill two page spreads, as do incomplete digital collages clearly created to sketch out lighting for a scene and not to illustrate a landscape itself. Dialogue is largely fawning over Cameron's creative genius and focuses very little on the process by which images were created by the artists, whose names are mentioned en-masse in the opening pages and sparingly if at all for the remainder. Everything you see in the book, you will already have noticed upon first viewing the movie. Binding started coming apart from the first opening and upon flipping through for the fourth time since buying the book, four page segments have fallen straight out. I really really wish they had taken advantage of all this book could have been. The placement and sizing of images is beyond amateur.    If you are interested in concept design elements of this movie, buy \\"Avatar, an activist survival guide\\". Many more images, including those of earth. Better presentation and softback binding that doesnt fall to bits. Whilst the text is entirely fictional and presents no insight into the creative process, nor does The Art Of Avatar.

Oh yeah, Earth was gorgous at one time, huh?<br /><br />Well, the Na'vi have us to thank for screwing up their planet too.<br /><br />There is a nagging thought though....I have seen this movie more then once. Campare it to the Stunningly gorgeously viewable film, The Last Samurai, which in its turn was compared to the gorgeous film of Dances with Wolves. I expected more from James Cameron. At least he didn't copy The Fast and the Furious

B0017JKEL8|5.0|I cannot comment on the show. I think everyone before me has already stated how great and original the show is. It's a shame that HBO rejected this series. I bet someone's smacking his head right now.    However, I'd like to comment on the Blu-ray package itself.    The unsophisticated packaging is a double edged sword in my opinion. It gives us a cheaper product to buy in exchange for a great show. However, it's not something to gloat about in your collection. HBO series tend to have this hugely elaborate packaging that makes their shows stick out on your video rack. Yeah it's all fancy, but it just leads to a more expensive product taking up more space.    The packaging itself makes it look like a regular Blu-ray. Nothing fancy.    Other than that the menus are easy to use. A little bit too many warning sings for the paranoid MPAA, but other than that it's a great product.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|I'm not going to issue any spoilers because this movie is best walking into without any idea of what the plot is, because you'll be more surprised and on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. I know i'm using two references to compare to Moon, but that to some people might be like [[ASIN:0345418972 Sphere]] and [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]] however you will see this is an extremely over looked film. It was released limited in the summer of 2009, and i had not a theatre near me that play it, but i knew this would be a gem and thinking person's film. The ending like Sphere has a lot left to be desired, but it also allows a lot of unanswered questions that allow discussion. I enjoy that sometimes, and with this film it doesn't destroy any of what you've just seen. I also need to mention the fact that aside from Kevin Spacey voicing the robot Gerty.....this film is in all aspects a One Man Show by Sam Rockwell, and its not to be missed. I just wish this film gets noticed and doesn't stay a sleeper hit!
0694481912|5.0|This is the novel that started not only a series of books by Mario Puzo later made into films by Francis Ford Coppola, it inspired many other studies of crime, organized and dis-organized!    Having collected video, DVD and now Blu-Ray of all the Mario Puzo's The Godfather, I realized I no longer owned a copy of the original novel. The hard-bound copy I purchased from Amazon is pristine. To me it is ideal to be holding a book while reading it.    In the novel Mario Puzo tells more about some characters who only appear briefly in the films. While I can understand constraints of time on film, even in long movies, it is fascinating to read details Mario Puzo provided.

B000BB1MI2|5.0|Hi, everybody. I'm back. And I am going to compare the two film adaptations of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", one of Roald Dahl's novels. The original from 1971 directed by Mel Stuart is known as \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\", while the new one from 2005 directed by Tim Burton has the same name as the book. There have been people who compared the new one unfavorably to the original, thinking of it as another half-baked remake, like that of the over-budgeted & over-hyped Planet of the Apes remake that Burton also directed, but there are others like me that beg to differ. After all, it is NOT a remake of a classic movie, but another film adaptation of a classic book. Here is my comparison between the two in my personal opinion.    First off, let's compare the depictions of Willy Wonka in both movies. Even though Johnny Depp gave a weird, creepy, and decent performance of Wonka like in the books, no one can beat the delightful, charming, and friendly Gene Wilder. From Depp's portrayal in the new one, Wonka shows disdain for families as a disadvantage on fulfilling your dreams because his dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka (Christopher Lee) deprives Willy of candy due to risks to the teeth. More details later in the review. Does that happen in the original? NO! In the end, Wonka brings in the rest of Charlie's family in the first place. He was also more concerned for the others in the old one as well. I have also seen better Johnny Depp performances from Edward Scizzorhands, Benny and Joon, and the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, for example. No offense.    Now for the supporting cast of both films. They vary in terms of advantages and disadvantages. the five Golden Ticket finders, Augustus Gloop, Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, Mike Teavee (yeah, I know, a silly pun), and Charlie Bucket were noticeably older in the original, but were younger in the book and new one. Veruca seemed more spoiled and grumpy in the original. In the newer film, Augustus wasmore of a pig and bites his ticket for comic relief, Violet processes Martial Arts skills, and Mike is smarter when it comes to technology and shows a dislike for chocolate (PPPHHHTTT!). Charlie and his family seem more poor and his father (Noah Taylor) was alive like in the book. In the book, the Golden Ticket winners could bring one or two relatives to look after you. In the films, it was reduced to just one to keep the budgets under control. So, I would give the new one the win overall.    Next up is the music department. Let's discuss the songs. The songs of the original were memorable and original, while those of the newer one were catchy and loyal to the book. To be fair, I had a little difficulty remembering the lyrics when I first saw the new film, so I looked them up on the internet and read the book. The only exception is the annoying introduction song before the puppet set catches on fire and the music distorts (now that's funny). Sorry, new Carlie, even though your songs are catchy, I have to give the original the win because of it having more songs with an Oscar nomination. In terms of the score, however, the new one by Danny Elfman was more catchy and suits the film like a glove, and when it comes to Elfman's other scores, let's say I came to expect that. So yeah, the new version wins in the score, but let's face it, in musicals like these, the songs are usually the main focus, so I'll give the original the win to be fair.    It seems that one common aspect that remakes improve over the original is the visual effects. In the original, some of the candy pumpkins were obviously balloons, the chocolate river looks like a YooHoo drink, you can barely see the tube connected to Violet's suit when she becomes a humanoid blueberry, and it features the infamous demon tunnel from Hell. The visuals of the newer film were more refined and advanced. The river actually looks like chocolate, everything looks more real, the Great Glass Elevator is made entirely out ofglass, and the tunnel is more of a park ride instead of a freak-out (thank god). The new film wins on the effects by a long shot.    Last, but not least, let's talk about the plot, the aspect that matters the most. The premise is the same. It is about a poor boy named Charlie Bucket, who is a big fan-boy of Willy Wonka. Wonka decodes to hold a competition to search for five golden tickets hidden in five Wonka bars and the winners would gain access to the factory for a tour and a chance to win a lifetime supply of chocolate. I already discussed the ticket winners in the supporting cast section. The greedy kids would mess up and end up in a horrific fate. Augustus would fall into the Chocolate river and get sucked up by a pipe, Violet would try Wonka's meal gum and become a blueberry, Veruca gets ambushed by squirrels and dropped down the garbage chute like a bad nut (falls down a trap door in the Golden Goose room like a bad egg in the original during her musical number), and Mike tests himself for a television project like the giant candy bar and becomes tiny. All that leaving the room for Charlie to win the factory as Wonka's successor. The plot in the new one is more in depth. It is closer to the source material in terms of main premise and tone, but has its share of minor changes as well. For example, the subplot on Wonka's troubled past is original to explain his origins and keep things fresh. The events of the past when Wonka went downhill thanks to spies stealing his secret recipies were also shown and features a bit with Prince Pondicherry and the chocolate palace that melted into a giant chocolate puddle on a hot day. Like the book, it shows what happened to the other contenders. Augustus seemed a little thinner and covered in chocolate and apparently fused with it. Gee, does that sound familiar at all? Violet became more flexible and still blue. Veruca and her father are covered in garbage and Mike was overstretched by the taffy puller. Also in the new one, continuing from Willy's past, while helping clean the fireplace while his father was busy with a patient, he finds a piece of chocolate that missed the fire, tastes it, and was hooked. He goes on a journey of knowledge about candy. When his father disapproves of this, Willy leaves for Switzerland with his mother to follow his dreams. He sees that his old home disappeared when he went to stay with a neighbor for the night. Willy goes to see his father with Charlie and it was revealed that he showed remorse for his actions since he had a ton of media from Willy's fame. Willy learns the true value of family and still took care of his teeth and Wilbur learned to accept his son for who he is. Another key difference is like in the book, Charlie and Grandpa Joe do not mess up! It's just more straightforward and knows what it wants to be.     In conclusion, even though I loved both of these movies, I enjoyed the new one a little more (3-2), mainly because of a more developed plot and was more similar to the book. Congratulations, Tim Burton, on another job well done! I also did a survey at my school one time on both films, and the original received the most votes from adults, and that is understandable because it was probably the one they grew up with. If you are like me, I would check them both out. They are worthy additions to add to your movie collection. See you next time!

B002R68U7K|1.0|I'm a huge Britney fan, but I just couldn't see the value in buying this product. UK girl group Girls Aloud did a boxset like this about 6 months before Britney and it was much better, it was better because each single contained all the b-sides and remixes that were released for each single, plus exclusives and a rarity disc including demos and other exclusive tracks. The Britney singles boxset pales in comparison, if you're a fan you'd know that a lot more tracks were released for each of her singles than what's on the tracklists for the singles in this boxset. Jive records could have released all the remixes and b-sides for each single and also could of added an exclusive disc of unreleased tracks and remixes, but instead we get this. When I first heard she was relasing singles boxset, I thought it would be similar to the Girls Aloud one, it's really a shame that they didn't put more of an effort into this product.     Oh well, hope her 7th studio album is amazing to make up for this.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|I am a huge fan of John's. I just found out about his music about three years ago and realized that I loved it - even drug my husband down to The Amphitheater at Clark County to see him in Concert. I originally bought his Continuum CD and fell in love with nearly every song. Then, I got his Heavier Things CD and found that I loved nearly every song on that CD! I couldn't stop singing his praises. This last effort must have been forced - for him to get it out the door. While 2 or 3 songs are good, the rest is too mellow or boring, and lacks that quality where you just want to sing along with him because the melody or beat really grabs you. I wouldn't recommend buying this CD, but would suggest that you just download specific songs that you've heard and liked. Sorry, John. Like I said, I really love your music ...usually. Hope your next installment is better.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|I love and own the original BBC production of Cranford (have watched it several times), was excited to hear that a three-hour \\"Return to Cranford\\" sequel was to be released on January 19th, and decided to pre-order it.  I must admit I was disappointed in Part One, which I watched on my local PBS station, WGBH-Boston, last Sunday night.  It felt contrived and flat, seemed poorly written, and was missing several pivotal actors.  Only the fine acting by Judi Dench and the comical Imelda Staunton redeemed this production.  Where were Dr. Harrison and his bride, Sophie Hutton (did they leave Cranford -- inpossible!), did Mrs. Rose marry the doctor and retire with him to some warm clime?, why did they have to kill off Martha (especially so soon), what about comical Caroline Tomkins and her new butcher husband, why did they replace Matty's dashing brother Peter with a far less attractive, eccentric actor (and weren't we left thinking at the end of the original Cranford that a romance might develop between Peter and Miss Pole? Instead he gives her a bird - huh?, leading to a slightly funny but kind of ridiculous \\"cage\\" scene), and I can't believe that Mary is engaged to a Mr. Turnbull (I thought she'd stay with Matty forever or at least for a few years since a year earlier, in the original Cranford, she denied any interest in marriage or babies).  It does seem natural for Jessie to have left for India with Major Gordon, but still I miss her (her sensitivity and emotional depth are features sadly lacking in this new production, at least Part One since I have yet to watch Part Two).  I guess I wanted everyone to pick up where they left off.  Because I am so curious about the missing characters, I really don't care about the new people -- although we heard so much about Septimus in the original Cranford that it makes sense he should arrive when Lady Ludlow dies.  Speaking of which, I didn't like that she died.  I wanted to see more of how the great Lady (and her views) changed with time and as a result of her relationship with Mr. Carter, now deceased, and Harry Gregson as he becomes educated and grows into a gentleman (and why didn't we see even one quick scene of his studies with the Reverend Hutton?).  The scene in which Lady Ludlow died was ridiculous -- sickly as she is, she stands for hours in one place and in a crooked posture waiting for her son's arrival and then all of a sudden falls to the floor dead.  Bottom line:  Part One at least just didn't work.  I had planned to watch Part Two tomorrow evening and then cancel my pre-order since the DVD wasn't scheduled for release until Tuesday.  But I got an e-mail that Amazon shipped it on Friday (and then promptly dropped the price by $.50).  Oh well, I'll put it in the drawer with the similarly disappointing sequel to the brilliant and entertaining 2002 Forsyte Saga.<br /><br />1/20/10 Update:  I watched Part Two of Return to Cranford this past Sunday night and thought it better than Part One.  Then, on Tuesday, the copy of Return to Cranford that I had pre-ordered arrived (and I was credited $.50).  I watched the series again over the past two evenings and I like it much better on second viewing, so I would increase my rating to 3.5 stars.  It's still not as good as the original, but well done nonetheless.  Now I plan to re-watch the original Cranford to compare them.with time and as a result of her relationship with Mr. Carter, now deceased, and Harry Gregson as he becomes educated and grows into a gentleman (and why didn't we see even one quick scene of his studies with the Reverend Hutton?).  The scene in which Lady Ludlow died was ridiculous -- sickly as she is, she stands for hours in one place and in a crooked posture waiting for her son's arrival and then all of a sudden falls to the floor dead.  Bottom line:  Part One at least just didn't work.  I had planned to watch Part Two tomorrow evening and then cancel my pre-order since the DVD wasn't scheduled for release until Tuesday.  But I got an e-mail that Amazon shipped it on Friday (and then promptly dropped the price by $.50).  Oh well, I'll put it in the drawer with the similarly disappointing sequel to the brilliant and entertaining 2002 Forsyte Saga.      1/20/10 Update:  I watched Part Two of Return to Cranford this past Sunday night and thought it better than Part One.  Then, on Tuesday, the copy of Return to Cranford that I had pre-ordered arrived (and I was credited $.50).  I watched the series again over the past two evenings and I like it much better on second viewing, so I would increase my rating to 3.5 stars.  It's still not as good as the original, but well done nonetheless.  Now I plan to re-watch the original Cranford to compare them.

031236198X|4.0|We read this book at a management off-site meeting and it worked very well as a way of getting people on the same page about change.  It is a simple and quick read so that meant everyone had finished the book before we got together.  It also has a fable like story that everyone could grasp whatever their background or education.  The eight points at the back of the book all make sense and as someone who works with people dealing with change either at work or in their career, they were spot on the money.  We are planning to have our whole department read it as a common language for change.
0316069906|4.0|Very thought provoking book.  More than thought provoking, if you are an omnivore it is very likely to result in provoking a change in behavior.  Foer does a good job with a very difficult and important subject.    It's OK to eat meat; what's not OK is to ignore the implications and consequences of that decision.  The easiest way to express concern for animal welfare and the environment is to be a vegetarian.  Foer's book points out that if you're not going to be a vegetarian, there is still a lot you can do to minimize the harm your eating habits have on the environment and on your fellow living creatures.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The child Alexandria has captured our hearts.  Wise beyond her years, she speaks with the innocence of a child who has seen too much tragedy and understands too much pain.  The simplicity of her conversations with Roy leave us laughing, crying and wanting more.  Her desire to help him is her way of making the world \\"right\\".  The stories he tells are played out in the mind of a child.  However, the beauty and magnitude of the scenery serve to intensify the continued tale... much as settings in \\"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\\" did when we watched it as children.      One of the most beautiful and sensitive movies to come forth in a long time.  Those who feel it is too simplistic are not paying attention to the detail.

0452289963|5.0|Many people are not at peace because they have negative thoughts running through their minds constantly and automatically. These thoughts trigger negative emotions. This book is about awakening out of that constant thought stream. This can be done by accepting rather than resisting the present moment. The result is a sense of peace because the negative emotions then no longer get triggered.

0307454541|5.0|\\"Tattoo\\" was my favorite thriller fOr 2008.  Only recently did I realize I had not reviewed it for Amazon.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson died in late 2004, from an unexpected heart attack.  Somewhat of a crusading journalist, throughout his career in Sweden, dating back to the `70's, he became an expert on right-wing extremism (primarily Neo-Nazi).  At the time of his death, he was editor of a magazine, Expo, and tried to live his  personal life in secret, owing to threats from the right-wing.  In the latter years of his life, he took to writing \\"detective novels\\" and finished three in a series he called the Millennium trilogy.<br /><br />Larrson apparently outlined a group of 10 books in 1997, and began working on them.  When he had finished the third novel, in 2003, he contacted a publisher.  Published posthumously after his death, the first of the books \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" (TGWTDT) became an instant hit in Europe.  Translation to English and publication in America crept along at a slow pace, and the bestseller did not hit American shores until September, 2008.<br /><br /> TGWTDT introduces the reader to two main characters, who operate singly in the beginning of the book, and combine forces as the plot tightens.  Mikael Blomkvist, too, is a writer and editor, whose pen has been temporarily silenced when he is convicted of libel against a wealthy Swedish financier.  At loose ends, he is contacted by wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve a family-related mystery.  Vanger's niece disappeared some 36 years ago, but every year, Vanger gets flowers for his birthday.  Is his niece still alive?<br /><br />Vanger requires Blomkvist to live temporarily in the midst of his family enclave at Hedestadt, a remote island, far from Blomkvist's usual haunts.  On the island, Blomkvist is forced to meet and deal with all the members of the Vanger family, which he discovers, is a challenge.<br /><br />Having set the stage, Larsson keeps many subplots going, including Blomkvist's worry about the financial condition of the magazine he left in the hands of his partner; his fight to save his reputation, knowing that the libel he was convicted of is actually the truth about business corruption; his need to juggle his assignment with the other Vanger family members; his need to bring in a computer hacker, a young woman by the name of Lisbeth Salander, to try to uncover the information he needs.<br /><br />Salander is a much richer character than Blomkqvist.  Not knowing how she fits in, the reader is introduced to her as a social misfit, comfortable in her own skin (including piercings and tattoos), far removed from the world of the Vangers and the one that Blomkqvist has inhabited.  She's only 24, has, in the past, been classified mentally incompetent; much of who she is remains a mystery.  As the duo begin to unravel the family's secrets, they come across a multi-generational pattern of misogynistic and savage behavior, a pattern of crimes against women that sets Salander's blood to boil (the original Swedish title was \\"Men Who Hate Women\\").  The final 100 pages of the book, where the past unravels, will assault your senses, and the book is not recommended for those who have a low tolerance for graphic violence.<br /><br />A little stiff in its characterization, suffering from the pangs of a new author and a difficult translation, \\"Tattoo\\" still manages to keep the reader spellbound, and wanting more in the next two books in the trilogy.  One of the top 10 sellers in 2008, and a winner of numerous prizes for fictional \\"thriller\\" writing, \\"Tattoo\\" will keep you awake at night after you've chased the ending to a logical conclusion.condition of the magazine he left in the hands of his partner; his fight to save his reputation, knowing that the libel he was convicted of is actually the truth about business corruption; his need to juggle his assignment with the other Vanger family members; his need to bring in a computer hacker, a young woman by the name of Lisbeth Salander, to try to uncover the information he needs.

0385532458|3.0|Slice-of-life stories from the Mississippi. All based in and out of Clanton. No twists. No surprises. Sheer curiosity may entice readers.<br /><br />Most living in the cities may be curious to know what life in the small towns and villages may be like. Beyond what is shown in the news, and beyond what appears in glorified paeans to the rural life. This book provides a matter-of-factly look. That is its strength. Just don't expect twists in the tale.<br /><br />However, some of the stories, in fact all of them, come to think of it, just end. They peter off to an ending. No unexpected twists.<br /><br />The best of the lot has to be the first story, \\"Blood Drive\\", a hilarious travelogue of sorts to Memphis. \\"Michael's Room\\" is the story that you wonder - about what could have been had this story landed in the hands of Stephen King. The most disappointing has to be \\"Casino\\". \\"Fish Files\\" is where Grisham gets close to the familiar territory of lawyers and legal firms, but that too is almost incidental to the plot.<br /><br />You will not get the satisfying endings, albeit at times macabre, that you get with collections such as [[ASIN:0312933525 A Twist in the Tale]], [[ASIN:B00197NEAG No Comebacks]], or the absolutely twisted tales in [[ASIN:0743491599 Twisted: The Collected Stories of Jeffery Deaver]]. The gold standard, of course, has to be Roald Dahl - [[ASIN:0140158073 Collected Short Stories of Roald Dahl]].<br /><br />Ok read.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Not historically correct but very entertaining.  My husband and I can't wait to sit down after dinner and watch a DVD or two . . .
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|This is the best show on TV. Every year I purchase the season on DVD. I don't have time to watch the show during the season so this gives me the chance to catch up. This show is something I don't mind watching multiple times, so having the DVD is great.     Twists, turns, mysteries, answers, questions, repeat. The island is almost a living entity, with many confusing, interesting, and unusual features. The characters are well developed, with their stories being told in the form of flashbacks and flash-forwards. The story line takes place very slowly, moving along similar in pace to a soap opera. Even with this pace there is plenty going on to keep your attention with island history and character back stories being woven together to form engaging scenes.    I had never intended to watch LOST. A co worker suggested it was a great show and I needed to see it. I was doubtful, but when I saw it on the shelf of my local movie rental store, I picked up the first DVD in the collection. Although a bit sensational, and certainly impossible, the show caught my attention and my imagination. I have been a fan ever since. The series is like a good book that you can't put down. Give it a try, maybe you'll get hooked too.

0385532458|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I liked the book.  It is a series of short stories, all centered around life in Mississippi.  But I couldn't shake the feeling that each of these stories were ideas that Mr Grisham had for a new book, but realized that they couldn't be fleshed out to the needed 300-400 pages.    The writing is first class, as with all of his novels.  The stories drew me in, but I was left with the feeling that there was more that could have been said.    I would heartily recommend this book to someone who has never read John Grisham and wants to get a taste for his writing style.  Read these stories and you will want to read his books next.  If you haven't had a chance to read anything by John Grisham, I would recommend you start with A Time to Kill

I also own Sennheiser PX 10 headphones, which do have volume control, but also have a cord that is too short.

This book reminded me of Upstairs Downstairs TV series - with the going ons of the rich and idle upstairs, and the poor and hard working staff, down the stairs.     But its more than that - its a great story told in flashback by a woman who was one of the downstairs staff.      Not only do you love reading about the past, but the present day story entrances you too.    Recommended.

I was simply blown away when I heard these favorites after oh so many years.

0316001821|3.0|I fell in love with this book at first when I started reading it.  I was so intriqued and into it.  I got about halfway through the book in one day.  Then the rest of the book wasn't so good to me.  I really did not like the last 3 or 4 chapters in the book at all.  SPOILER - I had been waiting on Suzie's family to finally uncover her murderer and for him to be caught.  I had been waiting on Suzie's mother to wake up and appoligize to her husband and family for being such a selfish, worthless wife and mother.  I never got this closure.  I hated that Suzie came back to earth one final moment and she spent it having sex with a man she barely new.  This made no sense to me and I was very put off by it all.  I wanted her to go see her family...for her family to finally have some closure.  For Suzie to go to her mother somehow and let her know that she was ok.<br /><br />With all this said let me say that I saw the movie last night and it was AWESOME!  This is one of those rare cases where the movie is much better than the book in my opinion!  SPOILER - First of all in the movie they don't have Suzie's mother have an affair with the police detective trying to solve her murder (which was a turnoff for me in the book for sure) and they end the movie quite differently.  You get more closure to me than you do in the book.  Also, Suzie comes back to earth to get the one experience she didn't get on earth...a kiss!  Not a romp in the shower like in the book.  I think the movie was much more age appropriate.  I think 14 year old girls should watch the movie so they realize there is evil in this world and not to trust everyone.  I would not however recomend that a 14 year old read the book...it just wasn't appropriate in my opinion.<br /><br />All in all I am glad I read the book because I think I enjoyed the movie more from reading the book, but the movie was hands down much better than the book and I wish the book would have been as well written as the movie.
0307269981|5.0|I discovered Stielg Larsson when I read the first book in this series, \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\". I was totally amazed, mesmerized and thrilled to find a writer of this quality that I had never heard of before. The first story was so different and so addicting I found myself reading a book I didn't want to end. That hasn't happened to me in years and years, and I read 6-8 books per week. When I finally put it down I raced to Amazon.com to see what else he had written and found therre were two more books in this series, neither of which were released yet. And I also found out, much to my chagrin and saddness that the author was deceased! Nooooooooo!!! I immediately ordered the next book, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" and then waited the agonizing weeks for it to become available. Meanwhile, I recommended the first book to all my friends. When the second book finally came I read it all in one sitting. Such intersting characters, plots and plenty of suspense! When you read a great book all in one sitting it's like eating all your Christmas candy in one day. There is a huge amount of time before Christmas comes again! And though I've ordered the next and last book I am faced with the fact that there will be no more after this. Why?
B0024FADAQ|5.0|We have always enjoyed this movie. It's great to have it back in my possession. Special effects aren't as technical as today but good anyway.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|This is the story of two humans who still live on a mostly ruined Earth, while most of humanity has emigrated to Mars after a nuclear war.  Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter, a destroyer of humanoid androids who have escaped Mars and returned to Earth.  J.R. Isidore is a \\"special\\" (a human with damaged DNA who is not allowed to emigrate) and a \\"chickenhead\\" (a man with below-average intelligence).  It's not difficult to determine how these two men's paths will intersect when three strangers move into Isidore's otherwise deserted apartment building.    Although there is some action and suspense, the plot isn't really in the main narrative.  The true story lies between the lines, in characters' reactions to animals, both organic and android, and in the strange religion of Mercerism.  This book is a melancholy tale of humans and our attitudes toward our fellow creatures and our own creations.  If you're looking for an exciting drama, you'll probably be disappointed.  But if you're in the mood for a meandering walk though a post-apocalyptic future, you'll love it.
B002SJIO4A|2.0|Spoiler: this movie is full of such contradiction and idiotic lines its almost laughable...hey lets treat these aliens like equals by asking them to sign something before they can move and now we are going to burn their babies alive. the main actor fails to have lines of any common sense \\"if i wave a gun in a government building and steal a very important vile so i can get my normal hand back then they'll take me back as i was before\\".and many more things are wrong with the movie,though i realize scifi movies are rarely believable this one takes the cake

B002PEP4HI|5.0|Mitch Albom's newest story \\"Have a Little Faith\\" is the first book I read on my new Kindle DX.  It is a poignant reflection of the author's journey to learn enough about a man to deliver that man's eulogy.  The eulogy is for the author's Reverend, a man he had known his entire life and \\"The Reb\\" himself asks Mr. Albom to say his final farewell and makes the request eight years prior to his death.  In the spirit of \\"Tuesday's with Morrie\\" Mitch Albom begins meeting with \\"The Reb\\" on a regular basis and in the process of learning about the Reb, he is reminded to look at the world beyond his own experience.   He meets another man along his journey, another preacher who reminds him to open his mind and his heart.  Have a Little Faith is a wonderful story, it made me cry at times and reflect on my own relationships reminding me to listen differently and learn from the experiences of others.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Well done Susan.  The CD is fabulous.  The only thing that could have made it better would have been to include the live, initial performance from the Britain's Got Talent version of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" to have made the CD complete.  Brava!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|An exact parallel to the Da Vinci Code, nearly down to every single plot twist.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I think a comparison to Star Trek XI, which appeared in the movie theaters about the same time as this movie, makes the difference between quality sci-fi and pulp sci-fi.    Star Trek XI has a rich wrap of color, effects, pretty actors & half nude actresses, and speed which cover a plotless action movie. It does nothing but entertain the viewer for the duration of the movie.    District 9 is good sci-fi. It takes creates a fictional situation, one that would have been possible only with the aid of science humanity does not have, as a tool to make the viewer think about issues that would be hard to make him think as clearly in other ways.      One such issue is how humans treat other humans. As one character says in the beginning of the movie: an alien ship came, and people expected music from heaven and bright shining lights (Close Encouters of the Third Kind ?) to be followed by humanity taking a great step forward (2001: A Space Oddysey ?).    Disappointingly, humanity stays it's old self. It treats the aliens same as it treated it's own kind, trying to trick it out of what it has for wealth and power. Appropriately, the prawns don't treat humans any better, and Christopher Johnson's first priority is to get help for his son & his people, Wikus taking a lower priority - and why shouldn't he ?    Which raises the question - if humanity develops spaceships, would we get any better ? Upon finding an alien race on another planet, would it be any different from what Europeans did with their ships when they landed on the costs of Africa or America ?
B002T9H2L0|1.0|One of my favorite movies is \\"Pulp Fiction\\". After that Tarantino satrted, in my opinion, to rot. And mow this... \\"Inglorious...\\" is one of the worst movies I saw in years. More than that... In the country where people do not read books and do not know their history you cannot do this. It is bad as it is when Americans never admitted that Soviets broke Nazis, but now it is a matter of a bad joke. \\"Basterds\\" won the war and Jesus is black by the way.    God save America.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has outdone herself in this Delightful CD.  Her voice is truly amazing and has a quality which my family rates as a female version of \\"Elvis Presley\\".  We're talking about quality here folks.  Susan is still a beautiful woman.  Always delightful to hear and see her when she sings.  Her heart and soul have gone into this album, and she creates a new song when she sings it, because it becomes her very own version.  Susan's talent is absolutely stunning, not to be ignored, nor trendy.  Reviewers have downplayed this hidden marvel, and the best is yet to come.  Susan has a charm all of her own, and she doesn't have to fit into anyone's mold.  She has a mold all her own, and it cannot be imitated.  If you haven't purchased this album, then you owe it to yourself to buy it for many hours of enjoyable listening.  We love Susan Boyle!

B001AIRUOU|4.0|By watching this movie right away you will think Tim Burton is a genious. I love the anamation and the darkness to it. Even the singing is incridable!    The film starts off in the land of Halloween with Jack, The Pumpkin King. After many years of of celebrating Halloween Jack becomes bored, sad, and depressed. While everyone is celebrating another great halloween, Jack takes a walk into the Forest and finds a mysterious place he has never been before.  A circle of trees each with a door and on those doors a picture representing a holliday.  He looked at each one and then stopped when he saw a Christmas tree painted on one of the doors. He opens it and finds himself in Christmas town. He was looking at everything with wonder, the snow, the elves, presents, and even Santa Clause. Later he comes back to Halloween Town to tell everyone about what he saw. But it was hard to describe.  After many expirements with Christmas he decides he wants to kidnapp Santa clause and become Santa himself. He changes his image and brings Christmas to Halloween.    This is a great film. And I nice way to put a Chrismasy twist on Halloween. I highly recommend it.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We bought this game for Christmas and everyone loved playing it.  It is a good strategy game where each player tries to build on his own color while other players are building on theirs and when they connect, the strategy changes.  We were all adults and found this game to be very challenging. The game moved fast and lasted the right amount of time for fun and then ready for another game.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon will be deemed a science fiction classic in the years ahead without a doubt. The stunning Duncan Jones  featurette was quite a well written, well-directed, and a very well-acted movie. The Clint Mansell music score is wonderful. The lunar and space visual special effects are a part of the movie's triumph. It is unfortuante that so many have to wait to get this on DVD. It merited a much stronger promotion in theaters. I strongly recommend the DVD purchase to those who think in near-term futuristic terms.      Sam Rockwell's performance as a lunar-miner astronaut is outstanding. He carries the movie almost solo and keeps you wondering throughout. Kevin Spacey's voice as the robot Gerty provides a strong supporting charcter. Yet the notion of lunar mining for He3 is realistic along with the sinister plot (that I will not disclose to readers and potential viewers).      This is a movie most sci-fi fans will want to watch more than once. Moon is a movie I will gladly share with friends and associates because it is such a creative and innovative piece of art set in the not-so-distant science and energy technology potential of mid-21st Century. It is worth every penny to add to the BlueRay library. Again, I strongly recommend this astounding Duncan Jones masterpiece. Whether you buy or rent or borrow, do take the time to watch and enjoy it. There is a lot of 'take away' from this 1.5 hour film.      I also recommend the Clint Mansell CD for the music as well.
B001TK3XO0|3.0|Finished the book. Rather, I hurried through it. Positives first. Its a compelling read. You want to know what happens next. The author really takes you under the skin of Laila and Mariam. You really understand what a male dominated society in its extremes can be. You see how political upheavals irreparably recourse lives.     Yet. This book is over dramatized. Its been accused of pandering to the western audience. I kind of agree - why else would you bring up Bamiyan. Why else would you show Taliban in one-sided light. Probably Rasheed's point of view could have been clearer. He too had a hard life. He saw wife-beating as a \\"done-thing\\" to establish his place at home. He was with plenty of faults - but still the near black portrayal of this character is somewhat disappointing.     Overall. If you want to lose yourself in a book, this is it. This is it. This is it. If you want to appreciate well written prose, this isn't it. Isn't it. If you want to appreciate storytelling (dramatic) - this is still it.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|It is hard to do this album justice in words - it has to be listened to to truly appreciate the masterpiece that it is. So why review it? I guess to help others decide if they want to buy it or check it out. I am a Mastodon freak and own everything they have recorded, so I knew when this came out that it would be different, having read many pre-release reviews. And I must admit that on first listen, I was surprised and disappointed. The sound was so different - the vocals especially - that I was almost reluctant to try to like it. But after a few more spins, I began to realize how amazing an album this is. The songwriting is very advanced, very mature and has the perfect balance of obtuseness and catchiness to make things more and more interesting on repeated listens. The musicianship is obviously top notch, and some of the grooves and solos are up there with the band's best material. It really is an ALBUM, in that the sum is greater than the parts - it is meant to be listened to in one sitting, in the sequence it was recorded. I have the deluxe edition with the DVD on the making of the album, and it is invaluable in understanding the background to the album, as far as Brent's recovery from brain damage and how it affected his writing, Brann's description of the \\"concept\\" of the album, and the whole production and recording process. Sure, Blood Mountain was a big step away from Leviathan, but Crack the Skye is a much bigger step away from Blood Mountain. If you really love the heavier thrash sound of the older stuff, you may have a difficult time with Crack the Skey. But if you enjoyed the more prog-rock style of Blood Mountain, and have the time to allow this album to really sink in, you will be greatly rewarded.
B0027G783W|5.0|Musically 'wait for me' is the best album I have ever come across ( by any artist ) . Vocals are heart piercing. For me '18' was more musical than 'play'. So if you have same feelings & if you love southern blues then this album is a MUST.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|Bought this item for a Christmas present. With the free shipping it was cheaper than any of the stores near me. Got here in time for Christmas, as promised. I'll shop this way in the future.
0156027321|4.0|This is a refreshingly different book. It won the booker prize in 2002. I'm not surprised. What I liked most about this book is his completely authentic understanding of animal behaviour, It documents to  clear extent the zookeeper's perspective. All of this in a completely humorous and entertaining package.     Its interesting how he brings in survival instincts of a castaway and details his methods of finding food, water and staying out of danger with a 450 pound Royal Bengal Tiger.     But I didn't follow why he elaborately talks about his childhood inclination towards multiple languages. Someday, I'll figure that out.     Highly recommended.
0439023491|5.0|I love the Hunger Games series. I think the story is amazing. I could not put the books down once I started. The night I finished the first, I was out the next morning buying the second and finished it in a day and a half. Now I am dying til August to get my hands on the third one. I am hungry to find out how it all ends. The only slightly negative thing I have to say is Katniss' struggle over her romantic feelings can be a little unbelievable and tiresome at times (and the scenes a little too clean for my liking), but then I remember that she is a teenage girl and that brings it all into perspective for me. I am not a teen or \\"young adult\\" reading these books so I have to keep that in mind. But, nonetheless, I'm totally hooked!!
B000FC2ROU|5.0|A wonderful novel, light enough to be relaxing yet simultaneously it is insightful and thought provoking.  The characters feel real, and the experiences they live, though fantastic, seem somehow plausible in this lyrical and imaginative universe.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|La pelicula se ve muy bien, aunque el sonido en muchas veces es baño generalmente Los efectos especiales estan brutales exelente adquicicion
1416562605|5.0|The nicest thing about this book is that it is real. The book tells us how a servant or labourer feels. Thats how they stay inside the rut and find it hard to break out. Thats the kind of effort it takes to break out.     The device used - as a first person dialog in a letter is slightly gimmicky. But it works reasonably well. Also interesting is the feudal streak of most landlords and people who rule the ruled.     Nice effort. I don't understand why the reception in India has been so underwhelming. Its perhaps guilt. Its perhaps negative portrayal of the Indian way of life. No one seems to like ugly images. Especially if its of them.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Excellent battery for my Canon 30D and 5D. I have an extra battery backup just in case of low battery. Highly this item for your photo needs.
B000JML7EC|3.0|It my opinion that RLS excels in the short story/novella genres, and is somewhat lacking in momentum in longer stories and novels.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Sold elsewhere on the internet for more than double, this was a good price on the collection.  We liked the slim packaging too.
0312944926|2.0|I enjoy Dan Brown's novels for the most part, but this one was a bit predictable, hard to follow and not very interesting. The villain seems forced, the good guy was mediocre, overall not an awesome read.
1415926697|5.0|I read \\"Eat Pray Love\\" on Audiobook and I totally loved it. The author HERSELF was doing the narrating so you definitely get the story exactly from the \\"horse's mouth.\\"  She travels thru Italy, India, and Indonesia in search of happiness, spirituality, and balance.   I loved how light-hearted it was and I liked the pace. I love her struggles and all the learning that the author goes thru. She's funny and I love that she recognizes her own \\"misgivings\\", such as, when she was in Italy and comments how she didn't even go into one church or landmark, for almost 2 months! I also love the part she wrote that \\"people say that they wish they were spiritually devoted so they can have the honor of living in an ashram, etc etc.\\" Cause sometimes i feel that way too.   I love her descriptions and the wording, humor, sensitivity. I'm most happy that it ended sweetly, on a good note.   This was a great book and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B001FB55I0|1.0|Bought this movie as a Christmas present at a great price.  Saving on each present means more presents for the folks on my list.  Thank you Amazon for helping me out.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's I Dreamed a Dream is a good CD and I have enjoyed it very much.  There are several selections on the album which I particularly liked.  Susan is so talented and her voice is superb.  Would recommend this CD highly to anyone.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Was a purchase and gift for Shelter Facility and a great hit. Kids play daily, pre teen and up and it is educational.  Wonderful purchase.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|May not be everyone's cup of tea,   but i really enjoyed it.    It gets a little slow for about a hour in the middle, but Tarantino   is known for his dialouge,  and keeps the conversations interesting.    I'd definetly a must for any Tarantino fans,  but i think it's worth a watch for anyone..
B002KREVCO|2.0|Nothing special in this new set. The Bon Scott songs are good, as is the live stuff, but the Brian Johnson studio songs (with the exception of \\"Big Gun\\") were not released previously for a reason -- they are awful. The videos are unnecessary if you're a serious AC/DC fan, as you probably already have them from a previous collection. Not worth the money overall.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I went to see Transformers 2  knowing pretty much what to expect,  and ended up being let down.    I went to see this movie in theaters shortly after,  not knowing what to expect at all,  and i was blown away.        One of the best Sci fi movies i've seen in along time,  very original.    I also couldn't believe it was made on such a small budget.
B002ZG997C|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  It is a simple, moving story about post-apocalyptic life with a protagonist who through his faith manages to bring a particular faith to others who may otherwise not have it.  I'm not going to say much more  because I do not want to spoil it for others who have as yet to see it.  What I will end with is that there are no \\"Holier than thou\\" or overly preachy elements in the film The Book Of Eli, yet it is an easy (faith wise), beautiful and poignant film... beautiful musical score too.  One of my new favorites!
0307473708|3.0|It is incredibly rare that I read a book and come to the conclusion that the movie or TV series is better.  Unfortunately, that was the case with this book.<br /><br />Lindsay has a wonderful overall writing style.  He is funny, poetic, and even sensual.  I also think he did an excellent job building up all the little facets that make up the man known as Dexter.  I was immediately drawn in and engrossed by his selective word choices and detailed images.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment with this book is that the characters that surround Dexter are completely flat.  The reader is left feeling just as empty and unfeeling towards the supporting characters as Dexter himself does.  Part of me wonders if this was intentional and if so I can't help but admire the cleverness of it.  But cleverness aside, it doesn't make for good story-telling.  By the end of the book I was frankly bored and relieved that it was a quick read.<br /><br />I think perhaps if this story had been told in a third-person omnipotent perspective it would have dramatically improved the entire story. It would have been easier to give all involved some real human characteristics.<br /><br />If you really want to see Harry, Deb, Rita, and others come to life - the TV series wont disappoint you.
B002RSDW80|5.0|A new pleasent type of movie.    This is a wonderfully great true story.  Everyone who loves eating,cooking,watching true stories must see this movie. It makes you want to do the same... as in write a blog and cook though the cookbook.    Even as a vegetarian I want to look up some of Julia's recipes.    This movie inspires me... and is fresh and funny also some sad moments.    Another must see!
1416594787|5.0|Many flowers guide bees in to land by little runways<br />markings, painted on the flower in ultraviolet pigments,<br />which the human eye can't see.<br />  Why - Because for the flower, insect pollination<br />represents a huge advance in economy over the the wasteful<br />scattergun of wind pollination.<br />  Insects on the other hand, by choosing the most<br />attractive flowers to visit, breed for floral beauty,<br />while the flowers breed the insects for pollination ability.<br /><br />  According to evolution, the wonderful spectacle<br />of the flowers and the bees came about as an evolutionary process.<br />  Evolution is a falsifiable theory, and therefore<br />a scientific theory.  Mammals haven't be around for all<br />the Earths history - so you wouldn't expect to find<br />mammal remains in old Earth layers like e.g. Devonian rock.<br />And indeed noone have.

And quite a treat it is.<br /><br />  Obviously, we can debate for ever what ''fact'' and<br />''evidence'' really means. In the book a ''fact'' is something<br />that really occurred, or is known to be true by observation<br />or authentic testimony.<br />  Biologists, and Richard Dawkins in particular, seems<br />awful sure about what is fact and what is not.<br />Whereas physicists, through quantum physics and more,<br />live in a world where ''fact'' is a somewhat slippery concept.<br />Trained in mathematics myself - mathematicians tend to<br />believe in abstract beauty, which is ''fact'', whereas<br />the world around us is a fata morgana you can believe in or<br />not. Depending on the time of day.... or if you have some mathematics<br />at hand that can explain what you see.<br />  My only grievance about this book (and<br />other books by Richard Dawkins), is his religious belief<br />in ''facts'' and his vendetta against people who doesn't<br />believe in the true ''facts''.<br />  In the world of evolution, surely you should be able to believe<br />the Moon is a green cheese, if that helps you survive.<br />No reason to be so upset?<br /><br />  But with so much at stake, our entire existence actually,<br />passions run high.<br />  Take eugenic breeding of humans.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I was very satisfied with Susan Boyle's CD I Dream A Dream.  I have listened to it several times.    I would love for her to do a spiritual CD and would buy the CD.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Eric Clapton has been collaborating with a lot of people lately. First, he worked with B.B. King on Riding With The King. Then, he reunited with Cream for their historic reunion concerts. After that, he worked with J.J. Cale on The Road To Escondido. Not to mention his two Crossroads Guitar Festivals. Now, he reunites with his old Blind Faith pal Steve Winwood on this release. This is one that has been a long time in the making. Clapton and Winwood mesh together so well, you'd think they had been together all this time. All of the Blind Faith numbers are stellar. Had To Cry Today is a wonderful opener, with Clapton and Winwood trading guitar licks back and forth. Presence Of The Lord is an inspirational song that has a nice rocking middle. Can't Find My Way Home is a great anthem as well. There is also some nice choices from both Clapton's and Winwood's back catalog. Personally, Forever Man, Tell The Truth, and After Midnight smoke for Clapton, while Well All Right, Pearly Queen, and Dear Mr. Fantasy exquisitely show off Steve Winwood's talents. But to me, the high point of the shows are the Hendrix covers. Little Wing is simply to die for, and what can you say about the 16 minute version of Voodoo Chile? Anybody who thinks these two guys are washed up need to check out this performance alone. Clapton's guitar conjures up Hendrix's voodoo spirit while Winwood's voice just amazes.<br /><br />All through this, I can't help but think that Clapton and Winwood need to go into the studio and come up with some new material. These two play off of each other very well, and bring out the best in each other. Watching the blu-ray, you could tell these two guys are very comfortable around each other, and simply love playing together. This live release is awesome, but now I just wanna bang the drum. Hit the studio guys!
080701429X|4.0|The biography section is marvelous. The section about logotheraphy is fairly technical, probably not of the enjoyment of people without knowledge in Psychology.
0061719544|4.0|Already being fan of The Late Late Show and of Craig's novel \\"Between the Bridge and the River\\", I was eager to learn more about him. The book is written as a series of short (5-10 pages) vignettes from his life. Regular watchers of The Late Late Show or those who have seen his stand-up special will recognize most of the stories, just in slightly longer form and with more cuss words. :-)    If you want to grok Craig's skewed view of life, this book is a fun and easy read. If you are looking for self-introspection or the overall arc of his life, you will likely be disappointed.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies ever. In my opinion that is. Everything is spectacular, the story and the plot, the actors (except the head of MNU armed forces) and the special effects. If you are a sci-fi addict, do not hesiate to buy!
B00275EGX8|2.0|This is my first review of a movie at Amazon.  Felt like I had to try to add a little balance to all of the glowing, obsequious reviews.  This film wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't entertaining.  There were a few scenes which built some tension, like the first with Guy Pierce.  Then ****SPOILER ALERT...LOOK AWAY NOW****, he dies.  I looked at my wife and said, \\"They killed off the main guy already?\\"    Anyway, this movie is slow.  I had to fight nodding off after about 45 minutes.  I think the cinematography was good.  Some of the effects were good.    To me, just about everything in the movie was way too predictable (save for the first scene).  Especially the doc going out on the mission.  As soon as he asked to come along, I said ***SPOILER****, well he's gonna' die.    Anyway, I'm not sure why so many praise this movie (sheep?) (bandwagon?).  Definitely not worth buying!    By the way, anyone notice the crappy packaging?  The Blu-Ray case cover has cut-out areas, to ostensibly save plastic and money?  It makes the case feel paper-thin.  Not good.
0440242401|4.0|this book was good. But some parts i didn't like. Not one of my fav. The ending was to short and was hoping for more detail. Just when they got to together it was over. not of her best book. But read can u keep a sercet love that book.
B002ZG997M|4.0|I was expecting nothing more than a typical action flick set after a nuclear war when I sat down to watch The Book of Eli today. I had just found out a few days prior that the book he is carrying is suppose to be the last Bible on the Earth, so I kind of had an idea where this movie might be going, but it delved even deeper into the religious aspects than I had expected. There are a few well shot and brutal action scenes (I loved that silhouetted fight that didn't have one editing cut) and the cast is pretty solid. Denzel Washington doesn't say much and lets his machete do most of the talking, but his performance was good enough to make me care for Eli as a character. Gary Oldman is always a treat to watch in any role and he plays a a creepy, confident and compelling bad guy here, without going too over-the-top. Mila Kunis is fine as well (enough to forgive her for Max Payne), which really surprised me. While her looks alone seem to get her movie roles, at least her acting here is almost on par.<br /><br />As you can see from the trailers, the whole movie has a sepia color tone, though it isn't as distracting as I had assumed it would be. There are some very nice visual shots from the Hughes Brothers and the set design, along with some of the locations are top of the line. Some might find parts of the film slow moving, but I liked the comfortable way it flowed. The twist at the end has been cut down by a number of critics, but it really caught me by surprise and I thought it worked in the sense that Eli always seemed to be more than normal man to begin with.<br /><br />The Book of Eli isn't great entertainment from start to finish, but it gives you a little to think about in between the limbs being hacked off. Works for me.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
0440241901|5.0|I love this book. You have to be crazy not to fall in love with this book. very funny and has romance. I was laughing out loud reading this book. This is one of my fav. i read it over and over and some parts are my fav. Gave the book to a friend who know loves the book. Go get it believe me u want be disappointed.
0385504225|4.0|Although this book wasn't as good as his other books, it still captures your attention and is a fluent read! After this book I put Washington D.C. to my \\"must see\\" list..... I hope he will cover some secrets of Asian and Middle Eastern World in his next book...  can't wait for the next one!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|Heard \\"Kids\\" on radio and took a chance on buying CD. Also MGMT is on Kid Cudi CD, song is \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" and it is one of my favorites.  I like the MGMT CD, lots of weird keyboards effects which are cool. Sort of a old school sound, Pink Floyd in some effects. Recording quality is not the best though, but maybe that's the sound they were after.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|The story is good and it starts out great but unfortunately it begins to drag out a bit and started to lose me about 2/3 of the way through. This might be one of the rare occasions where the movie version is better than the book.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|First of all, I liked this movie...I didn't love it.  I think a lot of people were simply curious what James Cameron had been working on for 10 years.  I didn't walk out of the theater thinking, &#34;That was the greatest movie I have ever seen.&#34;  It wasn't...far from it.  I really doubt the sequel will do as well, now that everyone knows what to expect.

B001DIDUHS|5.0|After Ozzy left a lot of people do not consider any of the Black Sabbath Albums to be true Black Sabbath albums, something that the band also agreed with.  Starting with the Dio Albums, the original band members tried to call the band Heaven and Hell, and again when all the members except Iommi left, Iommi tried to get Seventh Star released as a solo album that the record company intruded on.  I think some time after that Iommi realized that this was just part of the game and a way for him to get his music out there to the public.  For this part in his career I don't blame him, because Toni Iommi is the most influential guitar player in the history of hard rock and metal.  You do have to forgive him so very horrible albums by this point, Born Again and Seventh Star are among the worst albums in the history of the band, and even though Eternal Idol was a step in the right direction, it was not fully thought out.  Eternal Idol suffered from being high concept and having many different member changes in the middle of recording and the album did not sell to expectations as the band had cried wolf too many times and the fans were starting to leave.  Luckily all the discovery for Eternal Idol paid off here.  This is the best Toni Martin era album, and somewhere between Vol 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath in my all time favorite Sabbath albums.  This album rocks.  The organ themes that the band had been playing around with for mood finally got toned down enough that they do not appear to just be filler.  This was done by a now defunct studio that even at the time did not have the money for sabbath to experiment and they just went with their instincts, and I think forced them to regain some confidence that would last in this line up through the mid 90's.  This is a very satanic and dark album, and for the blues and organ countering iommi's blistering guitar work martin is perfectly cast.  Stand out tracks would be Headless cross, When Death Calls, and Nightwing.  There are some slower songs on this album that make it more easy listening but the creative intensity mixed with lyrical content make it almost impossible bo ignore while listening.  Because it is no longer in print the price is steep, but if you loved Iommi, but can that it might not be formatted like Ozzy Sabbath, I recommend this album as being worth the money.  If you have any hesitations or lack of exposure to Martin Era Sabbath I suggest you check out Cross Purposes as it is also very good, but much cheaper to find, but still not as good as this.
0316017922|5.0|Mr. Gladwell is a master story teller, blending humor and a rigorous scientific approach that is as informative as it is entertaining. It was a fairly quick read for me since both his style and the anticipation of \\"What else connects together\\" keeps you wanting to know what's in the next chapter. His topic was so interestng I've continued reading other books on similar topics. It's an eye opening book and a great read.

Sharon Van Ardel, has a fantastic voice, and I think she sounds better live than on a studio recording. The visuals are very good, with some great camera work. Sound is excellent aswell. Great song selection as well. Great bonus disc's too. Well a worth a venture if you're into this type of music. Even if your not and you like good quality live music, a must buy.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|If you are a fan of the Beatles this item is a must have. It has the entire contents of the Beatles catalog organized by the original UK album releases. Plus it includes the 2 disc set of all the singles that were released that did not get included on one of the original LP's. It also includes a flash video mini documentary about the recording of the original album. If you like you music in an electronic format this item is a great addition to your collection. You can play everything directly from the USB drive or copy it all to your local hard drive and access it that way. The unique design of this item is a real conversation piece (it is shaped to look the apple logo of the Apple Corps.) and it is made of a solid machined block of aluminum. It also has a smal magnet that will hold the USB device inside when it is not in use.    I really love this item and highly recommend it to anyone who is a Beatles fan!!

B0015UKX7E|5.0|Prince has done it! When I first saw this video I was blown away by his guitar playing. This shows him at his best! His showmanship is unlike any other artist out there. Artists these days rely so much on using machines and other people's music, they should be begging Prince to open a class for musicology!
B001HN69AY|4.0|Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is immortal. He made a deal with Mr. Nick, aka the devil (Tom Waits), that has kept him alive for over 1000 years, but at a price. Now Dr. Parnassus travels England with his daughter Valentina (Lilly Cole), Percy (Verne Troyer), and Anton (Andrew Garfield) inviting people into his Imaginarium, a place where you can peak into Dr. Parnassus's imagination where you are given a choice between light and darkness. When Mr. Nick shows up with a new challenge to collect five souls first by Valentina's birthday, Dr. Parnassus jumps at the chance. But when they save the allegedly amnesiac Tony (Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell), Dr. Parnassus wonders if Tony's been sent by the devil or his chance to right a wrong he made when he gained immortality.    Terry Gilliam is one of the most visually unique directors of all time. From classic movies like Brazil to cult classics like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the only American from the Monty Python troupe has generally bucked conventions working outside the studio system to create uniquely original works of art. As a result Gilliam is no stranger to controversy and issues with filming. Gilliam's take on Don Quixote was derailed from spectacular budget overruns, back injuries, freakish storms, and more; with the result being so catastrophic it became the subject of the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha. But even as devastating as that was, it could never have prepared Gilliam for what befell his 2009 movie The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Filming had to be shut down when Heath Ledger died mid-production. Fortunately, Gilliam and co-writer Charles McKeown were able to rewrite partsof the film, and Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell stepped in to finish Ledger's role so the world is able to see his last performance.    The reslut is nothing short of amazing. Imaginarium represents a marked return to Gilliam's former visual style. Being the first movie that Gilliamstoryboarded since 1988's The Adventures of Baron Munchasen, you can see the return of certain visuals that remind you of his directorial work with Monty Python as well as his great films like Time Bandits and Brazil. Visually this is one of Gilliam's most over the top films to date, but in the scheme of the Imaginarium it also represents his most successfully use of his visual style in years. The writing also represents one of his most original works in years, while also being one of his deeper works with more fully realized characters than has been present in his movies as of late. Also, the way they handled the passing of one of their main characters was also brilliant and possibly even serves the movie much better than expected and in the end just felt right.    The acting is naturally superb as you'd expect when you view the talent in this movie. Christopher Plummer is a veteran actor (The Philadelphia Story, Hamlet as well as newer movies such as 12 Monkeys, and voice parts in 9 and Up) you'd expect nothing less than a stellar, even Oscar worthy performance from on the screen. And, naturally, Heath Ledger was coming off an Oscar winning performance for his work as Joker in The Dark Knight and was formerly nominated for his role in Brokeback Mountain. While honoring the late Heath Ledger for this posthumously released role would seem the natural thing to do, I'd have to say that the best performances are delivered by Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. It's hard enough to play a real person, but to step into a role taking over for an actor that passed away, who still remains in the final film is beyond daunting. These three actors take his place in the film admirably, carrying on the spirit of Ledger to the fullest. Even among these Colin Farrell rises to the top in my mind as he ends Ledger's role, having to give the toughest performance of the character.    The only problem I can say that I have with this movie is that at times the plot can be impenetrable and even incoherent at times. For all of Gilliam's strengths, he has a tendency at times to be too in the moment without looking at the full picture, and particularly early on in the movie this can be slightly problematic. At first the movie seems like a series of vignettes rather than part of the whole. You'll also be lucky if, at the end of the movie, you can fully understand what the movie is all about. I'm one of those viewers that loves a movie with replayability, but as is the case with any viewer, it can be frustrating to watch a movie and wonder if it's just your ignorance or the fault of the filmmaker that I didn't completely understand what went on. While I think I have the movie pinned after hours of contemplation, I can't honestly say that I do until I rewatch it, which will be when it comes out on DVD.    Overall, though, I would have to highly recommend this movie. Yeah, it's a mindscrew (I would use other wording, but this is a family friendly publication), but it's a fun mindscrew. Visually stunning, superbly acted, and refreshingly original this is by far Terry Gilliam's best movie in years, and if you like any of his other movies (or Monty Python) you're most likely going to love this movie.    4.5/5
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have seen almost every Star Trek movie and tv show ever made, and I think it was brilliant to use time travel to essentially wipe the slate clean. Now they can make new tv shows and movies, or even redo the old ones. I'm a fan of revamping old stories, so I love that this movie opens the opens up tons of possibilities for overlaps in old stories without stifling new creative vision.<br /><br />Character selection was spot on. I had no trouble seeing each of the new cast members as the old ones. As far as I'm concerned casting could not have been better.<br /><br />The visual effects were great as well. I saw the movie in the theater, but when I bought the blu-ray, I found myself pausing it in certain scenes and thinking... \\"man, I don't remember seeing that before.\\"<br /><br />The movie was beautiful. The idea was brilliant. The cast was endearing. I'm looking forward to seeing more of these actors and actresses in more movies or tv shows because if someone doesn't start a new trek movie series or trek tv series, I will be disappointed.

B002MW50KO|3.0|What made Bob Dylan think that anyone would want to hear him singing Christmas Carols?  Bob's voice is beyond repair and really shouldn't be singing anything, never mind classic christmas music. Although there are a couple of lesser known tracks that are do catch your ear, the rest is painful at best.  I have shared this album, by playing it for many friend and the reaction by most people is shock and laughter.    Maybe he did the album as a joke...who knows !!

B002W0KCB8|4.0|When it has came down to the music industry, no artist on his own, or as a memberhas ever showed to change with the test of time for Rock music, like the legendary Paul McCartney. For his career spanning nearly 50 years, shows that there is no stopping what makes him a icon, whether it is with his solo success, Wings, or with the landmark of The Beatles. His status is always going to be etched in permanent stone. But what I find about him that is so interesting is that as he gets older, his feeling for pop music hasn't changed which is very hard to find in a really strong artist. It also has been nearly 50 years since he performed with The Beatles at the original Shea Stadium (the old baseball park of The Mets.) But to celebrate their new stadium, he performed the very first show there, and here it is.<br /><br />Good Evening New York City, Paul McCartney's latest album, is to me one of the most driven live records in years. He shows that as he has gotten older, his craft has never lost its older. The live collection of songs focuses in on tracks from The Beatles, his solo status, his work as a part of Wings in the 70's, and his lesser-known group The Fireman. The songs here sound great, as Paul performs a lot of great songs well like Dance Tonight, The Fireman's Sing The Changes, Hey Jude, the soulful and intimate My Love, The Beatles classic Let It Be, and many of his other great standards from the 45 years that he has made great songs. While I do honestly though wish he could've done a few of his other great songs like Maybe I'm Amazed and Freedom.<br /><br />Honestly, Paul has shown with time that he has never lost his luster as one of the most classic singer/songwriters of all time. Despite a few overshadowed songs, Good Evening New York City is actually a delight to listen to, and a great escape from so many of the younger, wannabe acts whom seemed to have ruled the charts like Beyonce' and Kelly Clarkson. But unlike them, Paul really shows how to make a great appeal from a live performance that still will always stand the test of time. If you've never heard any of his records before, or even seen him perform, than this would honestly be a great place to start.<br /><br />Album Cover: B 1/2+<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+ive performance that still will always stand the test of time.

B0033PQUL2|5.0|If any of Joan's movies deserves to be on blu-ray it's her defining picture, \\"Mildred Pierce.\\" As soon as it comes out I will be among the first to pre-order it. Joan's legacy will live on forever because of movies like this.
B000UR9QIK|5.0|Jumping in...the replay value of this movie is just fanastic.  Great movie, just really interesting.  I would totally expect the CGI generation to hate this movie.  I just have a great appreciation for what this movie was when it was released and its old school feel just really enhances its greatness.  The first 3 Romero zombie classics are absolutely essential to any horror collection.  If you don't like this...don't even waste your time with Day of the Dead.  If you do appreciate it, you simply must check out Day as its an incredibly underated classic in its own right.  BTW:  The blu ray of this movie couldn't be much better.  The picture is incredible!  Don't miss it.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Just listened to this because we played a song \\"If Today Was Your Last Day\\" during meet & greet at church. My grandson picked out it was Nickelback so I went up and asked and it was! So this is still Nickelback despite other reviews that say it is '80's Rock..what kind of '80's rock...Van Halen?? Surely not New Wav '80's, cause this is solid Rock!  BTW, the 80's had some very good music in it..good ole Rock 'n Roll.  And what's wrong with being mainstream if it sells CD's?  It's not selling out, it's making a living and continuing on Most of todays music I can't make use of the whole album, constant screaming, grunge, no lead guitars, not melody.  I am old school and believe music should be music, melodic, listenable lyrics kinda of Rock. It shouldn't give you a head ache! I give this 4 stars because of the cussing (which I think is inappropriate for music..our kids & youth are listening people, like it or not!) so if they had left that out, I'd give it 5 stars. (I had to cut those parts out so my grandson could listen to it..he's into music) That said, I hope Nickelback keeps it up..I really like this one, plenty of radio playable songs, plenty of Rock N Roll.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\" is a subtle yet hauntingly powerful movie. The weather is cold and snowy in some far off nordic country, but no one seems be aware of this as no one seems to wear hats or gloves. The buildings are made of steel and concrete and the interiors are as bland and unappealing as the weather outside. In the midst of all this starkness are two 12 year old kids who share a common bond of being on the outside of society. The boy is bullied and beaten by the neighborhood kids and the girl lives in a sparsely furnished apartment whos sole mission in life seems to be living day to day off peoples blood. This is not your typical hollywood dracula movie full of action scenes and drama. In fact the film is eerie. People are discovered dead in the snow but the police never become part of the movie and the few neighbors who suspect the girl are dealt with by the girl's supernatural powers. The end of the movie left me with haunting questions that I pondered over for days. For me the true test for a good movie is one that sparks an internal dialogue for days after you have seen the movie. Get it and watch it!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|i bought this double album cd on another auction site, for cheap $$ and got a non-censored double disc which i find extremely enjoyable! in fact, it's been playing on my home system, in the car, and at work for the past week! very catchy tunes, somewhat redundant yes, and just a fad, i know...but very enjoyable and worth it for the hits and simple pleasure!
0451228731|4.0|I finished this book in three days. I didn't feel that it fell apart as some other reviewers have said, because the ending came as somewhat of a surprise to me, and I look very forward to a sequel. I think this book would make an amazing movie and I hope it makes it.    I've read some of the other reviews which state that too much of the middle of this book is to be disbelieved, because how can a someone predict and prepare for future conversations via computer, etc etc. Anyone with an understanding of technology would find the situations played out in Daemon incredibly plausible because they could occur from millions of combinations of potential scenarios embedded within programming code (these are processes with which we already interact every day... does Joe's email not say \\"Hi Joe\\" everytime he logs in?). I do believe that someone lacking in technological terminology may become lost / confused / overwhelmed with the author's usage of acronyms and programming language, so they might have a hard time following or even find it too much to finish.     Kudos to Suarez for his first novel.
B001TH16DI|4.0|First off, I don't know what the DVD's looked like because I didn't own them.  I've watched the first three movies out of this set and am amazed at the quality.  The first movies were shot twenty years ago and they look just as, or almost as, crisp and sharp as any other new HD movie I've seen.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse's chronicles of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves have made millions laugh since the 1920s.  Far from being dated, they appeal to every generation that encounters them.  The Granada TV series from the early 1990s, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, are faithful adaptations which add new sparkle and delight.<br /><br />Bertie Wooster is a hapless young aristocrat with a large income, no ambitions or formal education to speak of, and an unavoidable predilection for trouble.  Into his life steps Jeeves, a cool, calm, and collected gentleman's gentleman who brings order to chaos within minutes.<br /><br />Each episode of Jeeves and Wooster has essentially the same plot:  Wooster finds himself in a tight spot, and Jeeves gets him out of it.  Many of these tight spots involve females: Bertie has two aunts, Agatha and Dahlia, both of whom are determined to rein him in and get him under control, while a succession of young women see in him ideal husband material and do their best to get him to the altar.  These putative brides include the absolutely hilarious Honoria Glossop.  Bertie is also beset with a distressingly large number of friends from the Drones Club, and when Jeeves isn't helping his master out of a mess he's often drafted to do so for Gussie Fink-Nottle or some other young wastrel.  But even though the plots repeat themselves, there are always new twists and kinks in the road, so every single episode is worth viewing and reviewing.<br /><br />Those who know Hugh Laurie only from House are in for a delightful introduction to his silly side, while Stephen Fry is a master of the adroit eyebrow twitch or cautious ahem. You'll laugh all the way through them, and then want to turn around and watch them all over again.
B000000ZGO|5.0|There is an amazing contradiction to Issac Hayes: He wrote for Rufus Thomas, Carla Thomas, Sam and Dave, basically, anyone on Stax in the 1960s. These singles are the example of stripped, driving, Southern soul. Motown was sugar. Stax was salt.<br /><br />But Hot Buttered Soul is Hayes going in the completely oppisite direction. These four tracks are soul, but if soul could be progressive rock, this album would be such. It is almost as if Hayes set out to do the antithisis of his behind the scenes work at Stax.<br /><br />The reason does not matter. This masterpiece does. These four tracks, \\"Walk On By,\\" \\"Hyberbolc.......\\" \\"One Women\\" and \\"By The Time I Get To Phenoix\\" open soul up in new ways. Taken beyond the three minute soul singles Hayes helped invent, soul could be wide open spaces, filled with endless sounds and textures:<br /><br />Listen to the phased guitar on \\"Walk On By,\\" the way it bulids--slowly--into an orchestral epic. \\"Hyberbolic.......\\" has a bending guitar riff that makes you question who inventived Hardcore Funk jolies--George Clinton or Hayes. \\"By The Time I Get To Pheonix\\" is soul as cinima.<br /><br />No one really picked up on the mandate Hayes set on this album. (Ok. Maybe the progressivism of Earth Wind and Fire does) Soul seemed to get softer and funk definately got louder. As art rock, soul possibilites were never really explored.<br /><br />But this album is pure invention, and reminds us all, again, when you think outside musical boxes, virtually anything is possible.

B000B0WODA|3.0|Franz' first album had songs that all, for the most part, sounded very different from each other.    However, to me a lot of the songs on \\"You Could Have it So Much Better\\" sound alike.    The songs that DO sound profoundly different are:    - The Fallen  - Walk Away  - Do you Want to  - Fade Together  - Outsiders  - Eleanor put your boots on.    The rest of the album is 2-3 minute up beat songs that I honestly think sound very similar.    I'd reccomend purchasing The Fallen, Walk Away, Outsiders, and Do you Want to as downloads.

B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Clint Eastwood goes to the extreme in this movie. Talks about a real world issue that is touching and it hits home for many.   The neighborhood reminds me of my Grandpa's place in Alabama and the story is just written so well.   He went above and beyond to find new actors and actresses (you find out how in the special features) and even though they are new, I believe they did an outstanding job. Some may be offended by the racial remarks in the movie, so be advised on that.   Overall, just a plain COOL MOVIE!!!
B0026P40NU|5.0|This is an incredibly bawdy show. I imagine it will be cut to pieces for the US tv market. If you can get hold of the uncut BBC version, go for it!   The series is a look at the life of the Pre Raphaelites and tries to show why they were do revolutionary. Today they have a very staid and boring reputation, but their art took the world by storm.  So, strap on your seatbelts and take a roller coaster ride through the lives of four young artists and their models as they drink, take drugs, whore and paint themselves into a frenzy. The device of a totally fictional \\"brother\\" as a narrator works beautifully.

0201626632|5.0|This book is extraordinarily valuable for anyone with a doctoral degree in the natural or social sciences (Although the author is a physicist, I found his advice transferred very easily to my experiences in the social sciences, and is far better than similar books by social scientists.  I only wish this book had been available when I was a grad student).  The author is concise; he says what needs to be said and leaves out the fluff.  I strongly disagree with those reviewers who said his advice was common sense.  If that were true, then why do so many intelligent students fail to follow these guidelines and end up dropping out, struggle in dysfunctional environments, or in some way fail to reach their potential?  I found his advice to be rich and rewarding, and what he said frequently described the people I saw every day when I was a grad student.  The fact that he refers to \\"overhead foils\\" is trivial and does not mean the book is outdated; the advice is not outdated by any means.<br /><br />Not everyone sees things the same way or has the same experiences, and I am sure there are other viewpoints, and one should always seek out a variety of opinions, but the author has a viewpoint that one should not miss.  A short book, but one that is worth its weight in gold.

0061474355|5.0|[[ASIN:0061474355 Sabriel (Abhorsen)]] is a fascinating fantasy novel. The characters are believable and filled with life, and the juxtaposition of modern and Old world's somehow ominous.

B000WQWPJQ|1.0|The transfer of this wonderful movie is pitiful, Fox should be ashamed of ripping off their loyal customers with these poor quality Blu Ray Movies. This movie is not even that old. It looks grainy, the blacks are off and the lines are blurry at times. DO NOT BUY, THE DVD LOOKS BETTER. I do not think I will buy a Fox movie until they start remastering  and get their act together, perhaps if enough people stop buying, they will start releasing these masterpieces in a quality format.
0143038419|4.0|I am surprised that people are up in arms because this isn't a serious spiritual book or that is was all about the author. It was her journey and her memoir.  Of course it was all about her.  I didn't expect it to be life changing so I wasn't upset, but I did find many of her thoughts and ideas provocative.  I really enjoyed her story and her truth.  It doesn't mean that it matches mine.  I liked her realness, her warts per se and how she didn't take herself to seriously in her quest.  I find her relationship with God interesting because it is both reverent and irreverent.  But I think God can handle that just fine.  At least I hope so. I look forward to reading more of her work....but I am not looking for her to be my Guru...perhaps just another guide.  I didn't even feel like I read the same book that some of you reviewed.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Sgt. York is one of those bygone movies of yesteryear that does what most movies these days do not:  reflects wholesome family values based on a true American hero.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|First off if your somebody that starts off saying \\" I've been playing guitar for blah blah blah and I like blah blah and dont like blah blah, and theres no music just talking\\"...your an idiot!!! This movie was very loud indeed. Sometimes whats being said is more powerful and moving than the volume in which it is said with. This movie is everything it says it is and more. From the very begining of the film it clearly states in writing on the screen three men get together to discuss the elctric guitar. Even Jimmy says they are supposed to have a chat and the instuments just happen to be there. This isnt some all star jam session or instructional video of Jimmy teaching the others how to play stairway to heaven. If this is what you expected you are going to be dissapointed and if it takes you untill the end of the movie to figure this out you were probably paying more attention to your musical ego than the movie itself.    So three men get together to discuss the electric guitar. They talk about their love, hate, history, influences, tatse, favorite makes and models, and much more all wrapped up in a warm blanket of chemistry between the three of them. Each man unique in his own light. To understand why these three were chosen is simple... they are different from eachother. By generation and by style. It would be quite boring having three guys all saying and playing the same thing. Each has a different story and background. Jimmys being very technical and creative, The Edge being very scientific in his persuit of a certain sound using hardware and effects, and Jack White who is a little harder to epxlain but it makes him all the more interesting, Ill just say the electric guitar is a constant struggle to him in his persuit of his inner sound.     Jack White does kinda seem like the odd man out at first. He may just be a little nervous about meeting the others, but after a bit he warms up to them. At one point Jimmy is showing him something on the guitar and you can tell by the look on Jacks face he is so humbled and happy to be in the presence of the others that hes trying not to break out a smile but he cant help it, much like a little kid that cant not smile. At the end of the movie they all enjoy a song together. Not some total rock out with the volume cranked to 11 but a simple acoustic piece that brings out the love for one another (which is kinda funny since the movie is supposed to be about electric guitar not acoustic). They all end up with that same little kid smile on their faces playing the song as the camera slowly zooms out and the credits scroll upwards. I had that same smile on my face as well.

B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is an amazing movie, even for those who are not Star Trek fans.  The story line is one which means you really don't need to have seen the other Star Trek movies.  The first ten minutes are non-stop action and tear-jerking sentimentality.  This version comes with a free digital version for download to your computer and then transfer to an iPod.  Great cost saver.
0810982862|2.0|Tarzan spends some years in Africa. After that he can virtually fly through the trees, converse with all the animals and wrestle a gorilla. Meanwhile people who live in Africa their whole lives and across multiple generations cannot do anything like this, not even a little bit. They are natural, traditional and despite various poses are helpless. They also cannot see common sense or solve any problem for themselves. For that they worshipfully bow before Tarzan who solves any problem for them that requires thought or bravery.    Avatar can be seen in 3D. The people are blue and gigantic. The bad guys have giant robot suits so they can fist fight the gigantic blue people. Ripley from Aliens does not fight in one of these robot suits. If you bring a kid be prepared to tell them about all the spicy language they should not bring home from this movie.  Add the Tarzan piece and you understand Avatar.    Watch Aang instead.
B001GWK2MC|2.0|I was very excited to set this up for my 14 month old and my 29 month old, during cold Michigan days for a 1 hour indoor activity.  Unfortunately, within 20 minutes of following the inflation instructions, I noticed the floor chamber was loosing air.  We found the tear in the material and patched it only to find that there was another hole somewhere else in the floor.  Great size, colors and concept but it will not stay inflated.

B000OLGCI4|4.0|If you like Disney, you will appreciate \\"The Jungle Book\\".  It was made in the 1960's, thus it is interesting to see a Disney movie from that era.  It has good music and likeable characters.  \\"The Jungle Book\\" would be a great addition to a Disney movie collection.

0143038583|3.0|I already know a lot about food, nutrition, and agriculture so this book didn't really add anything.
0385338724|4.0|This book is about a woman in her twenties. After a bump to the head, she wakes up in the hospital to find that things are very different. She has to figure out how and why things have changed to help save her department. I don't want to give any of the story away. I may have already. There are so many parts to it. It's a very fun read; one of those books that you want to keep reading to see how it ends. The main character is very easy to relate to, and I found myself rooting(sp?) for her. A part I keep thinking about is the Mont Blanc, which was disturbing to me because her husband is kind of creepy. :)    One thing I can share is that I bought this at Target for less than half of Amazon.com's price, and it wasn't on clearance or on sale. I would say the price, but I've noticed that Amazon.com just cuts prices out of everyone's reviews.    Happy reading!

B002K0WBXW|5.0|Disney for adults ... funny, sensitive, captivating ... just as kids can watch his movies over and over, this one has that same quality for us.  It's a fun romantic, comedy to watch ... Andrew's line: \\"Margret and I (long pause)are just two people who weren't meant to fall in love, (short pause) but we did\\", says it all ... a lie that turns into the truth.  The characters are well developed and endearing. The movie has basically two endings, the dramatic ending that leads into the credits that slide over for the final bonus ending ... a continuation (days later) that reminds me of the one in Must Love dogs ... only funnier. The actors deliver the scenes with words, eye movements and gestures, cleverly layered with music and/or sounds, with key pauses and pronunciations and pace that add interest and intrigue ... and the camera even plays a role.  Watching the movie more than once, you'll notice background actors that add to the comedy ... in particular the scenes in the office are cleverly setup and filmed ... you only see part of the movie the first time ... switching focus from Margret to Andrew then to the office folks there are different comical feature there that, for me, took viewing the movie more than once.  A fun movie.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Joe Pesci, love to hate him. What a cast of greats! Plus Scorsese writing and directing...
0156034026|4.0|Hmm. I loved the narrator's monologue but I wasn't convinced  the narrators interlocuter would want to sit around listening to it. If I was the American, I don't think I would have, especially if his purposes were as shady as is implied. I also wasn't particularly convinced by the narrator's political awakening - and really his change of life is all about politics and justice and nothing to do with religion, so the title is  misleading. Nothing in Changez's worldview seems to be about Islam as a religion, simply about Islam as an identity. But then again, as he admits himself, his story may not be true.     However, I very much enjoyed the structure, the narrators voice, the ambiguity of the ending , the very vivid invocation of Lahore, and the latent hint of menace in almost every paragraph. I read it in 2 sittings and was sorry to reach the end

B002QEXNDE|4.0|If you are a Norah fan you'll dig this...and most likely you'll dig it even if you are not a fan. This is a solid, good album and the matte, gatefold, heavy weight LP is very nice. The recording is really nice too, it's all very good. But I can't give it 5 stars, because even though it's better than most modern music out there, this just isn't a life defining LP nor is it a sound system demo LP beyond all others. It's just really close. Great music, great sound, great pressing... just not the cutting edge. Well worth your money.

B000VEA38E|5.0|I bought this for Christmas for my daughter who is a Star War biggest Fan! She collects everything and admires   this Music of Star Wars 30th Anniversary Collection, she was in such awed when she got this as a gift. As she did  not ever get the soundtrack for the original movies and was so excited to get this and it was beautifully set and   everything in tact. No damages and was sent early. Anyone who is a Star War fan doesn't have this Musical, I assure  you will not regret this if you should ever order. The Price was steep, but it was worth it.

1416594787|5.0|I don't think I could add anything to what has already been said in favor of this excellent book. In my view Dawkins is a genius and an incredibly honest and courageous individual.  I have found something however, and it's the only thing I've ever found , that I would take issue with Dr. Dawkins about.  In the chapter Dawkins titled \\"Arms Races and \\"Evolutionary Theodicy\\"\\" he writes that in a previous book he said Nature is neither kind nor unkind. Peptides called endorphins secreted by the brain have a pain-relieving effect very similar to morphine. I recall years ago reading about a U.S. Marine who in storming a faraway beachead in WW11 incurred a massive and fatal wound.  There was even a painting of this Marine depicting him literally covered with blood from head to toe.   Fellow marines attending him recalled that he seemed to feel no pain at all, but rather was simply embarrassed that he could not continue the fight!  Likewise a brother of mine suffered a massive and fatal injury in an automoble accident many years ago and witnesses said he had a broad and peaceful smile on his face when they finally freed his body from the wreakage of his car. It's hard to see how great pain and suffering could cause someone to assume such a blissful and smiling countenance at the moment of death.      With regard to fear I think many animals (and humans too) simply don't have the time to experience much fear when death is imminent. They only have time to react in ways that will hopefully spare them the fatal blow, just as we react instinctively when we see a snake or just something that looks like a snake. Years ago while riding a motorcycle on a heavily traveled two-lane highway I suddenly found myself in a head-on collision course with a car traveling at high speed. I had to either get off the road very quickly or collide head-on with this car and face almost certain death as I was traveling at a high speed as well. Amazingly I felt no fear! I instinctively got off the road onto the shoulder as fast as my reactions allowed me. I didn't have time to be afraid.  I had time only to react.     Likewise I think it's safe to assume that a Thompson's gazelle, for instance, when faced with a lion chasing it at breakneck speed, has little time to be very afraid. It has time only to react by hopefully running faster than the lion, or at least faster than a fellow gazelle who is also running for its life. And if caught endorphins would surely lesson much of its suffering.     There is certainly fear and suffering in the natural world as natural selection selects but not nearly so much I think as Dr. Dawkins would have us believe.
B001U0HBQ0|5.0|I hate to sound so pretentious in my review title. But, if you think this movie is slow, the characters undeveloped, exc., you don't get the main message of the film. As we get older, Benjamin's life story becomes more meaningful. We eventually understand the complexity of Benjamin's situation. If Benjamin is flat as a character, you are not already engrossed in the message of the film. If you were, Benjamin's flatness would be reinterpreted as confounded acceptance of a world none of us can begin to understand. Benjamin in not so much a character, he is representative of that dilemma we all face: what has our experience of the world prepared us for, and why do we never seem prepared for \\"what's coming for us\\"?       Benjamin ages backward--he is born old and gets younger, stronger, and more beautiful as time goes by. Almost all of us dream of such a turn of events. We all say: I wish I could have been wise and knowledgeable in my prime--we all want to combine the strength of our teens and 20s with the knowledge of our 30s, 40s, 50s, exc. Benjamin is able to achieve this. At 60 years of age Benjamin is ravishingly young, fit, and beautiful--and he already has the experience of a lifetime! However, Benjamin's blessing is also his curse and he finds himself still separated from everyone, still blindsided by the events and revelations of life.       If you don't find life \\"curiously\\" astounding and unpredictable, if you think that, somehow, your \\"experience\\" has prepared you for \\"what's comin\\", then please don't bother with this movie. But, if you are like the rest of us--simultaneously confounded and enraptured with the \\"curious\\" turns of life--this is the movie for you.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Since great crime shows like the Shield and the Sopranos have ended, it's nice to see networks putting out shows like Sons of Anarchy to fill in the missing gap.<br /><br />Sons of Anarchy is about the inner workings of a Biker gang and is seen through the eyes of it's VP, Jax (a perfectly cast Charlie Hunnam). Like most protagonists of shows like this Jax is dedicated but reluctant in his gang's activities. His reluctancies about his biker brothers' methods (especially the gang's leader Clay) are even more pronounced with the birth of his premature son and discovery of his deceased father's journal (who seemed to have his own reluctancies). The episodes (especially in the beginning)play out almost exactly how you expect them to usually closing with a journal entry from Jax's father reflecting his beliefs in contrast to the episodes plot. Thankfully the show's entertaining enough that you usually wont care and things actually start to get more complex in the last few episodes (hopefully this bodes for an even stronger season 2!).<br /><br />The acting in Sons of Anarchy is perfect top to bottom. Ron Perlman has never been better as Clay the biker leader who fears losing control over his crew. Katey Sagal is exceptional as Clay's wife (and Jax's mother), someone with a shady past who puts the gang's ideals before anything else (even her family).<br /><br />Sons of Anarchy may not be the most original show out there but it is entertaining. If it seems like it's stealing ideas from other shows at least they're GOOD ideas. If you're a fan of good crime shows like the Shield, you wont want to miss this strong series.
B002ZG997M|5.0|A strong well done movie with a powerful message.  For once, a move with a decent screen play, good acting, and a positive message.  The movie was neither boring, nor pointless.  It was not what I expected, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  If the message is lost on your, I feel sad for you, but for others, you may feel a sense of relief and hope the Hollywood is not completely lost in a world of materialist socialism and pointless blood lust movies.  The acting, story line, screen play, production, and directing was all in sync.  The end was defiantly a twist, but very well done.  The movie was not predictable. I walked away with a good feeling, not traumatized as does other films.
1423101472|5.0|So here's the deal with this book:  If I taught a higher grade, I would so assign this as required reading with plenty of theme essays that would probably result in all students despising this book forever.  I mean this as a compliment.  Rick Riordan has managed to turn popular Greek mythology on its head with this spunky series that gives these timeless tales a humorous wink and nod while still creating an epic tale filled with heart and soul.<br /><br />\\"The Last Olympian\\" is the perfect powerful ending that combines brilliant storytelling, rip-roaring action, and heartfelt emotion.<br /><br />Kronos is, more or less, ready to take over Olympus and thus the world.  Camp Half-Blood isn't safe, home isn't safe, and Percy has a week to fulfill a prophecy (whatever that means).  The War hits full-speed here, all tensions are high... I'll just say it's pretty darn intense--an intensity that somehow manages to fulfill all expectations I had.<br /><br />The story is imaginative, with plenty of intelligence and wit.  Riordan knows his mythology and knows how to praise it and make it work for this story.<br /><br />Fantastic ending to a fantastic series.
0307408833|5.0|I just finished baking the chocolate cupcakes and preparing the chocolate frosting so that it can set in my refrigerator.  I did not wait for the cupcakes to cool, but rather took one out, blew on it to cool and popped it in my mouth.  These cupcakes are amazing!  I also admit I licked the spoon that I used to get the frosting out of the blender - Oh My Goodness!  I am so happy to have found this cookbook!    I recently had to change the way I have been eating for health issues.  I am on a diet that restricts eggs, dairy, sugar, yeast,  and gluten.  Needless to say, it's been hard to get used to and even harder to find products that accommodate all of these restrictions!      I had a friend who told me about the cookbook.  I figured it was too good to be true and would be too difficult, yada, yada, yada.  I waited.  Then for my last birthday, another friend bought me a dozen cupcakes from the actual bakery in NYC.  I was in love after the first bite.  The love and the time and the effort that this woman has put into these creations absolutely comes through in the flavor, the consistency, the final product.  I quickly bought the cookbook.    1. The initial purchase of all of the items you need can be a little costly (compared with regular baking ingredients).  I look at this like an investment in my health and happiness.  I can now eat a special treat along side everyone else at birthdays and dessert times.  No more making excuses as to why I can't indulge.  And the most expensive ingredients tend to go pretty far, so you get many products from one purchase.    2.  I read this book cover to cover and no where did I see the writer make any claims about these treats being good for absolutely anyone to eat.  It seemed to me that she was simply trying to make products that are free of the usual suspects and that taste good.  It also seems to me that she has succeeded!  She has a very successful business in NYC and another new one in L.A.  If  these recipes fell flat, shewould have closed her doors long ago.  Further, she explains that not all of the ingredients are gluten free or sugar free, so if you find something you can't have in the ingredients, either  a.) don't make that recipe or b.) use the substitutions that she has detailed in the book.  When it comes down to it, you are responsible for making sure that the food that goes into your mouth doesn't have anything in it that you are allergic to.  Look at the ingredients, make sure that they all are ok for you and then make that recipe.  Or make the necessary substitutions, as explained in the book.    3.  I have made these products quite a bit lately.  I have family and friends begging me to make them cupcakes and cookies.  These are people who are used to full fat, full sugar baking ingredients.  They have stated how much they like my baking and how great they taste.  These products are not just for allergy prone people.  Truly they will be enjoyed by even your most finicky guests!    4.  The fact that I use agave nectar to sweeten my cupcakes means my son doesn't run around like a maniac after I give him a treat!  It's so nice not to want to keep him from having a sweet because I don't want to deal with a 2 year olds' sugar high and sugar let down.  I have not had these problems giving my son these treats.  I also feel better about giving my son a treat without all the chemical and preservatives in it.  He seems pretty happy with them too!      5.  There were a few occasions that I had questions about an ingredient or a result and I wrote to the bakery.  They were so accommodating and helpful!  I was able to get the answers I needed and my sweets have been so much better.  I don't know of many other authors of cookbooks who will answer your questions.  I was quite surprised to get the response, but even happier at the willingness to help me succeed in my baking.  Thanks Babycakes!    6.  You may not get it exactly right the first time (I screwed up the frosting several times before I got it - I had the wrong ingredients!  My mistake), different ovens work differently and so you may need to adjust time, you need to measure everything with dry measuring cups, not liquid, coconut oil should be melted before measuring, better quality products yield better quality products (I highly agree with using the french valrhona cocoa mmmmnnnn), etc.  But if you stick with it, you'll find it's not scary, it's actually quite easy and the results are worth it!    I noticed that there were some unfavorable reviews and I truly couldn't understand them.  This book is wonderful!  The sweets are delicious!  All of the time, effort and love that the author put into creating this truly comes through in the final product.  The author takes the time to explain substitutions, where you can get the products, what she thinks works best, etc.  I have been able to follow these directions and make some great stuff!  I am very appreciative, as are all of my friends and family who are benefitting from my new love of baking!  Thanks again!    I would highly recommend buying and using this cookbook.  Whether you are allergy sensitive, vegan, health conscious or just want to try something different.  I have never really been a good baker, but thanks to these recipes - no one would ever know that!    Sincerely,  Deborah P.

0385504225|1.0|What should I say?<br /><br />I'm a great fan of Dan Browns earlier books \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" or \\"Demons & Angels\\". After the long break and the long delay of his new novel, I was very excited to get a copy.<br /><br />The beginning was very promising, but the longer I read the more disappointed I got. I'm wondering what this book was all about? What happened in this more than 500 pages? In my opinion, really not much. The story was boring. You can read about the Freemasons or the Ancient Mysteries or the Lost Word, the Apotheosis of Washington, the Masonic Pyramid etc. But what's the hype of all this? Are those topics really so famous? I'm sorry, but before this book, I have never heard anything about any Freemasons. So it was a book which covered broadly unknown topics to most people.<br /><br />Another bad idea was, that the story took place in Washington or below the Washington Monument. The Washington Monument for example was built around 1850. That's really not very old, at least if you compare it with Rome for example, where his former books took place. But in the story, you can read about \\"the man's most advanced intentions and man's most ancient ideas\\". It seems that the origin of all this was buried below the Washington Monument.<br /><br />I was also not very glad about the chosen words. You can always read about \\"the most....of all....\\", \\"the most ancient ... of mankind...\\", \\"the most terrifying view of all\\", etc....<br /><br />And when I thought that everything was told and the story will be over in a minute, Katherine came forward with a really \\"astonishing remark\\": \\"There's something important I want to tell you, Robert. There's another piece to all this... a piece that I believe is the single most astonishing aspect of my research.\\" (REMARK: You see, one of the many exaggerations in the book...). All I thought at that moment was exactly what Robert Langdon answered in the book: \\"There's more?\\"<br /><br />The whole book, I waited for something special to happen. But suddenly, I was at page 500 and nothing really special happened.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but the next time, I will at first read many reviews before buying another book of Dan Brown!<br /><br />My only conclusion to this book is: Waste of money and waste of time!!!00 and nothing really special happened.     I'm sorry, but the next time, I will at first read many reviews before buying another book of Dan Brown!     My only conclusion to this book is: Waste of money and waste of time!!!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Wonderful. I have seen the play and this is an absolute great film based on it. The visuals are stunning and the story is enhanced as only film can bring it to you. For the first time you will get some real backstory of the Phantom. The music is richer thanks to a super sized orchestra and the actors all did a wonderful job singing. Emmy Rossum's voice is beautiful and I liked it more than Brightman's! Gerard Butler is great and does an admirable job singing. He is not a trained singer but he brings an edge to the role. His vocal style is rough and I believe it works for the phantom. A great movie and should please all.<br /><br />NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Beautiful picture and sound. Nothing mind blowing and not a DEMO DISC to show off your Blu Ray power. All the special features are carried over. If you are a big fan than why not picK it up? Final verdict: UPGRADE IF YOU LIKE.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This docu is definitely worth it for the Jimmy Page bits.  I don't know much about Jack Black, though \\"The Edge\\" is too much of a retard to even have a conversation with Jimmy Page.  seriously, \\"The Edge\\" is like at .01% competence on guitar to Jimmy Page.  \\"The Edge\\",  We get that you like echo on yer guitar sound.  well done.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The BATMAN FRANCHISE had fallen! Joel Schumacher I will never forgive you for BAT-NIPPLES! So why do we fall? The BATMAN FRANCHISE picks itself up with vengeance! The movie is awesome and the best BATMAN ever put on film! You will learn the origins of Batman better than ever before. For the comic purists some liberties are taken but don't you want to be a little surprised when you go to a movie? A great job by all and Christian Bale was the perfect choice! A must see movie.<br /><br />NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Absolutely worth upgrading. The picture is more vibrant and the blacks look great. A movie this dark needs to be seen on Blu-Ray. The sounds is excellent and all the extras are here. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE? YES YES YES!
B000TENE6Y|5.0|This Album is one of the best albums ever of any genre.  Great music and a huge turning point for the band.  You need to have it.
1933771690|5.0|This book is profound in that the author gives reasons why current and past concepts of space and time are simply constructions of the human consciousness to comprehend the data of the consciousness. The idea that mathematics and physics only provide models from which we can deduce predictions of further information from our senses is not new. What is new in this contribution, I believe is that the authors point out that even the framework for all of thought, i.e. space-time, has no guarantee of existence at all.<br />The ideas presented are very clearly introduced and discussed, thanks to the good grace of these gentlemen to carefully write their book.<br />The book is a must read for all those who like to think.

0739432176|5.0|My absolute favorite book of all time is the first book in this trilogy, Sabriel. The second and third books (Lirael and Abhorsen) are almost as good. Sabriel, the first of the 3, could normally be read as either a stand-alone or as the start of the trilogy. The 2nd and 3rd books must necessarily be read together. Sabriel is the story of a girl who is from one world, a world of danger and magic, but who grows up in another world, a place amounts to an English boarding school in a town only a few miles from the border between those worlds. At the end of her final year at school, a creature of death from the other world shows up with a bag of gifts for her and the message is clear- something has happened to her father and she must find him and learn if he is even still alive. She learns the truth about her family history and she befriends the talking cat Mogget and the mysterious Touchstone on her journey. There are powerful beings doing everything in their power to stop her and kill her. Lirael + Abhorsen takes place about 20 years after the events of Sabriel. The story focuses on other members of Sabriel's family and a new villain that is one of the beings left over from the creation of the world... the destroyer and he will not stop until he has fulfilled his namesake in both worlds.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Will go down as old classic, with time. The story is special but sound track is what makes the movie. Seeing it and hearing it in Blue Ray makes it worth while, that is making the purchase.

0545123267|5.0|SHIVER was my first experience with author Maggie Stiefvater and it won't be my last. What attracted me most to the book was it's a YA love story about a girl and a werewolf. I'm a huge fan of paranormal love stories. If you are too, I highly recommend this one.<br /><br />SHIVER is book one of The Wolves of Mercy Falls Series. The story begins with Grace who has a fascination with a wolf. This wolf has visited her for six years straight when Minnesota is covered with snow. He disappears in the summer and she has no idea where he and his pack goes.<br /><br />Sam fell in love with Grace the first time he saw her. He's watched over her, but at a distance. That was until their worlds collided. Although he wanted to, he never meant for Grace to find out who he really was--what he was. She did though, now he has a secret to tell her and he has no idea how.<br /><br />When I finished SHIVER, I was blown totally away. Maggie Stiefvater has a literary edge to her writing style that makes me stop and take notice. This was not a book I wanted to speed through. I found myself stopping to reread sections of the book again.

I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one.  An UNABRIDGED copy!!  This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy!  If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!!  I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!!  I will be returning this copy and continue my search for a REAL copy of Little Women that hasn't had words changed, modernized, or \\"dumbed down\\"!!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|This was a great premise for a movie, however, after a short while the movie seemed to repeat the same theme --- boy gets answer right, based on an experience he previously had.  Doesn't seem possible that someone who was that poor could have had that many experiences and would be the exact answer to a question asked on a game show.  He didn't seem any worse for wear after he was treated so harshly when he was on the program the next time.  All in all, I had expected a much better movie based on all I had heard about it.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|One of the best movies ever!  The scenery is spectacular and yes, filmed in the Lake District in England.  I was fortunate to go there a year after filming and can now watch the movie and actually know exactly where certain scenes were made.  This movie has so much heart.  The acting and writing are superb!  There is nothing else to say except that I am so glad to own the DVD to get my fix whenever inclined.   Kristine Alford, TX
0805079831|2.0|To begin with a positive, I was fairly excited about this book. Free market logic is often presented as all butterflies and rainbows and I was hoping this book would cover the darkside to this logic, or at least give me a more balanced view of the flip side to the coin. What I instead got was a gross misinterpretation of free market thought and a demonstration of the evils of corporatism when combined with military and governmental power. This, combined with what I feel an overstretched analogy and seeming Bias resulted in my awarding two stars for the work.<br /><br />My first problem arises with her use of the ECT analogy. Many have complained about this and I know I am not alone here - I know these days a book has to have a catch phrase to be popular and all but this analogy is grossly overused. That isn't to say it is irrelevant - not at all - but rather to say I feel she takes an example of something cruel, then ironically uses it to \\"shock\\" your emotions into buying into what she said. Though I'm quite sure she fully believes her use of it to be completely relevant, another reviewer (Trevor Goodchild) summed it well when he used the phrase \\"emotionally manipulative.\\" That is exactly how this feels. This isn't something that ruins the book, I suppose more of a stylistic complaint even, but it was persistently present throughout the book and deserves mention.<br /><br />My second and much larger problem with this work is her confusion of a free market with corporatism. She uses the terms completely interchangeably without the slightest hint that they may not be the same thing. A wonderful example of this: \\"...U.S. government had created their markets with war, barred their competitors from even entering the race, then paid them to do the work, while guaranteeing them a profit to boot-all at taxpayer expense\\" This is a prime example of what a pro free marketeer would be against. Barred competition, guaranteed profits? Do I really need to explain how that is NOT a free market? This too has been addressed numerous times in reviews and discussions of this book: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5HYZ2S30IF/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&cdMsgNo=27&cdPage=3&cdSort=oldest&cdMsgID=Mx3UQNA20BNE9ZT#Mx3UQNA20BNE9ZT<br /><br />On a personal note, I also take offense to her outright bashing of charter school's. I myself greatly benefited from a charter school education and in her section on post Katrina re-construction she unabatedly describes their efforts as weak simply because they are privately run. This is, in my opinion, one of the weakest arguments in her book.<br /><br />There is some real potential in this work, and her section on Iraq is especially moving. Specifically, it does a good job of giving the impression that much, or even all of the war was highly influenced by corporatist policy. However, this appeal is not consistent throughout the book. More often than not, it is a picture of a crisis or disaster occurring and capitalist influence following after the fact. This is where my final complaint comes in, and it is one of bias. Specifically, she gives these examples of private organization's failing to respond sufficiently to a disaster and the conclusion then automatically becomes \\"Well if the government alone would have done it, it would have all been better.\\" Now I am certainly no expert in this field and I want to be clear that my complaint is that it feels like one sided, unbalanced fact presentation. I'm walking away questioning whether and how it could have turned out differently; this is what her book is supposed to convince me of.<br /><br />My final take is that this is a book that could have been much more. Corporatist influence is most certainly something to be worried about; calling it \\"free market capitalism\\" and producing a work that feels coated with bias will do little to curb its influence.is too has been addressed numerous times in reviews and discussions of this book: http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5HYZ2S30IF/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&cdMsgNo=27&cdPage=3&cdSort=oldest&cdMsgID=Mx3UQNA20BNE9ZT#Mx3UQNA20BNE9ZT    On a personal note, I also take offense to her outright bashing of charter school's.

1558908455|5.0|This 1996 classic is not usually my kind for film because the description included the word \\"vampires\\".  But it was starring Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis.  It was also on cable TV and was certainly worth a look-see.  Well, it sure was something different for me.  And I must say I wound up loving it.<br /><br />The film starts with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as a pair of bank robber brothers on the lam.  They stop by a liquor store and Quentin Tarantino brutally murders the clerk and a cop.  Immediately we see he is the demented one and throughout the film George Clooney tries to rein him in.  Well, the film gets more complicated when the brothers kidnap a family driving a mobile home and force them to sneak them over the Mexican border.  Harvey Keitel is cast as a former pastor who has lost his faith and is taking his two children, Julliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, on a vacation to Mexico.  So far, this seems like a formulaic gangster flick.<br /><br />And then the group stops at a weird and wild Mexican strip joint where Clooney and Tarantino are supposed to meet up with a connection.  This is just the beginning of a whole new aspect of this weird and wonderful film.  All the dancers are gorgeous, especially Selma Hayek who is the star of the show.  But then we find out that everyone, including all the bartenders, dancers and assorted customers are really vampires.  And that's when the film really gets creepy. The next scene seems to go on forever with blood and gore and offbeat high energy.  It is so strange that it actually becomes fun to watch.<br /><br />Perhaps I would have hated this film if it was produced by a lesser talent.  But it held me captive with its fast-paced explosive special effects.  There were times when I actually laughed out loud at its unique outrageousness.  That's why I must recommend it.
0743486285|5.0|If you love crue and enjoyed, \\"The Dirt\\", then Heroin Diaries are for you! A backstage pass into the life of a rich rockstar with a bad drug addiction. I liked the book because Nikki Six included input from people who he let down or hurt along the way. It also removes some of the glamour of the sex, drugs, and rock and roll lifestyle. The party has to end sometime.

B002BJGYUS|4.0|The Gilmore Girls grabbed me from the first episode with the witty conversations, surprising twists and telling the story of an atypical teen, her relationship with her mother, her grandparents and their adventures in a small town outside of Hartford, Conn. The episodes receive the rare five-star rating because the stories and characters feel real while making you chuckle plenty of times.<br /><br />The bonuses are disappointing because they're not closed-captioned or subtitled. Being deaf, I could not enjoy the extras. Seasons 1 - 3 all fail to come with subtitled extras. I imagine the rest won't have them either, but haven't confirmed yet.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|I loved The L Word as it went to air and have watched the entire series a few times now, so it made sense to purchase them on dvd...  What a great value pack!  Looking forward to seeing the extras, as this show can get really addictive...  The girls feel like friends and now I dont have to miss them...  Just want to add, its not just for lesbians, am a straight women but still felt connected to and could relate to the characters :)  Buy it!!!
B0021L8UPS|5.0|This is a classic case of why I do not read or believe what I read when it comes to critics or editorial reviews.  This was an excellent movie and certainly entertaining.  Does it stretch the imagination??   Of course, but what Hollywood movie doesn't.  It was well acted, and a good story.  Do yourself a favor, and view it.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Even if you know this film by heart, this DVD is worth it for the extras.   How many classic films from decades past have both stars doing the commentary?   Not to mention Karen Dotrice (who played Jane Banks), who adds another charming touch, and a moving tribute to Matthew Garber, her sibling in the film, who died of complications of Hepatitis acquired while traveling in India.      But there's more:   a documentary entitled \\"Disney on Broadway\\" provides a fascinating behind the scenes look at the craftsmen who adapted P.L. Travers work to a new venue:  the stage.   While obviously a bit of a puff piece, and there's a whiff of self-congratulation here and there, frankly, much of the pride here is well deserved.   Travers' well known scorn for certain aspects of Disney's film is well known.   How Disney Exec Thomas Schumacher and producer Cameron Macintosh finessed the great dame into giving them the rights makes for interesting viewing.       A last point-- so often when we are offered a glimpse behind the scenes, we find out that a magical film wasn't always so magical for those involved in the creation of it.   Not see here.   For everyone involved in this production (and everyone seems charming)  it seems to remain a high point in their lives.   Disney magic indeed.   Don't miss it!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I love all (some more than others) of the Reacher books! I can't wait to see Jack Reacher brought to life in the possible feature film!!!     I have read all of the books and this one was certainly no disappointment. So much action! I love the way Reacher thinks (which, incidentally is how Lee Child writes I guess). There's a lot of \\"hidden\\" comedy in the books too. Especially if you have read other books...     If you like the show Dexter, you will like these books. Reacher is the same concept just kinda cooler! And he sounds WAY hotter than Dexter! LOL    But seriously, if you like a crime/mystery/action book - you will really like this and any of Lee Child's other books...
B00275EGWY|5.0|There's a moment in this film where the character played by Jeremy Renner loses his emotional detachment and it almost kills him.   It is this moment which lifts the film above what is otherwise simply the most intense and riveting war film of 2009.       The film doesn't argue either for or against the war in Iraq.  Rather, it is about the relationship between man and war itself.       This becomes especially clear in a scene late in the film where the hero returns home.    He has become a warrior;  peace no longer makes sense to him.    It is this implicit warning that war becomes an end in itself that makes this film especially powerful.    I know this is a difficult truth, and a difficult film;  but what has happened in our country that a film this good can't get financed by or released by a major studio?    Are we so busy amusing ourselves with eye candy that truly we are \\"entertaining ourselves to death\\" while collectively marching towards the precipice?    This isn't a film that will cheer you, but it will definitely make you stronger.

My only recommendation to anybody would be to be careful with measuring the flour as I had some dry cookies come out of it, but I don't sift my flour before measuring. Love the ideas for packaging too.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I have been intrigued by Susan Boyle since seeing her first appearance on \\"Britain Got's Talent.\\"  Like so many millions watching her preformance on YouTube, I was thrilled when she \\"turned the tables\\" on both the audience and the judges who, obviously, were judging her by her appearance, age, etc. before ever hearing or seeing her talent!  I have never seen an artist \\"turn the tide\\" for herself so quickly causing her viewers and judges to feel ashamed for having judged by appearance only or having judged too quickly!      Right then, I decided to purchase her first CD if she were so fortunate as to make one.  I have enjoyed the CD, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" many, many times since buying it in December.  I think I purchased 6 online and have now given every one of them away except the one I keep for myself either to be played when I am driving or when I am at home listening to other music along with Susan Boyle's outstanding CD.  I have enjoyed the diversity of the music selected and still find myself in awe of all the good things that are happening to her.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|There's not a more epic release this year by a mainstream band. All the glorious brit-rock, now full of more Queen than ever before (see pre-chorus to the title track: \\"could be wrong, could be wrong...\\") There are so many grandiose moments, and they don't just rely on their distortion pedals to do it, either. Most evident and daring is the Exo-Genesis symphony that concludes the album - 3 tracks, 3 movements. Matt Bellamy has been composing this sucker for more than 5 years now, and he finally reveals it. It's nothing short of magnificent. And if you're like me, you're wanting the guitars to show some muscle like on previous releases. Never fear. MK Ultra brings the pain, even though it takes the length of the song to arrive. When it does, you want the song to go on for another 5 minutes. Can't wait for this concert. (track to sample: \\"United States of Eurasia\\")

0783225857|4.0|It's a wonderful, dramatic movie version of Lee's award-winning novel. It won three academy awards and was quite daring and innovative for 1962 to talk about rape by a black man of a white teenager. The story takes place in a small Southern town in 1935, and highlights the relationships of children with the town, and the events are seen through their eyes, and of course, the white town's view of the black people. The young girl tomboy Scout (the narrator)is a hoot, but probably will have real behavior problems in adulthood.  The other children are her brother Jem and the neighbor boy Dill. The plot has been repeated in the South many times, black man falsely accused and covicted, and then eventually killed while \\"trying to escape.\\" The real white suspect in this story is later killed when the mentally handicapped neighbor stops him from harming the children.  Gregory Peck was deserving of an academy award for playing the conversative lawyer Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem, a part different than his typical role as a war/cowboy hero. A fine review of what some of America's problems were in the past. It seems appropriate that I watched and reviewed the movie on MLK Day.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown does suspense pretty well.  Even as I was rolling my eyes at many of the absurdities or poorly researched parts of the book, it kept me turning the pages.  Just for that, this book gets a \\"good\\" rating.<br /><br />As a quick aside, Robert Langdon is a terrible protagonist.  I feel no connection to him whatsoever.  When he does show brief glimmers of personality, he just seems elitist and stuffy.  In this book particularly, he is swept along entirely passively and one never gets the feeling he has any impact in driving the plot forward.<br /><br />The dialogue was either ridiculously cliche or laboriously pedantic.  People just simply don't talk in real life as they talk in this book, which suggests to me that Brown was thinking more about the inevitable movie adaptation instead of just writing realistic dialogue.<br /><br />The handling of the CIA was laughably bad, coming off more as a network serial handling of the intelligence community than anything reflecting real life.  Firstly, CIA agents don't wander into places broadcasting their affiliation.  Secondly, they don't use cell phones to talk about things of \\"the highest classification.\\"  They don't threaten people with \\"CIA inquisitions\\" and they don't pull rank on Capitol Police.  Brown's mishandling of this just seems lazy.  If anything, FBI involvement would have been more appropriate, since they have some amount of domestic jurisdiction.<br /><br />Finally, this book was largely just repackaged Ba'hai, which is essentially repackaged secular humanism.  There is nothing new or mysterious or powerful about the concept of man using himself as a foundation upon which to build, autonomous from God.  Only people entirely unfamiliar with the Bible or the Koran could say that \\"they both basically teach the same thing.\\"  Contextually, literally, metaphorically and morally they do not teach the same thing whatsoever - they teach very different things about the world, God, and man's relationship to God - therefore winding up at very different intellectual end points.  The idea of synthesis of religions into one concept about God defies the first rule of logic (A cannot be non-A at the same time and in the same relationship) and is basically laughable.<br /><br />That said, I still give this book 3 stars because Dan Brown is an excellent suspense writer.  He paces his books well and as long as you can just suspend your disbelief over some of the more egregious absurdities, it is an enjoyable book.ent intellectual end points.

0545140315|5.0|When I first heard about this book I was couldn't wait to read it. Though, then I read some really negative reviews about it and some that put The Lonely Hearts Club in a good light. So when I ended up receiving this in the mail, I had no clue what to think. Would I love it like I hoped I would? Would I hate it like some others did? Or would it just be a blah type of book? Luckily, The Lonely Hearts Club turned out to be one of the funniest and cutest books I've read this year!     There are so many great things going for this novel. For one, Elizabeth Eulberg has created a cast of diverse characters in this novel ranging form the popular girl to the jock girl to just the smart and semi snarky making this a novel that I think almost every girl could find someone to relate to in a little or big way. Even though I find it so hard to pick a favorite because I adored almost all the characters, my personal favorite would probably be a tie between Penny, the main character, and her best friends Tracy and Diane. All three where hilarious, good hearted and just all people that would be a blast to hang around if there existed in real life , leaving it to be so hard not to root for them. Oh, and Ryan was so adorable! But that's all I'll say about that topic.     Further more, I loved the premise of this novel even if I did find it to be a bit cheesy at times. Since, it was original and had a fantastic message! Plus, I loved all The Beatles references that were made since it brought the originality level even higher in my opinion. And the ending was so cute!     Overall, The Lonely Hearts Club is a novel that every girl out there should read! Though, I'll have to warn you that you'll probably be wanting to listen to all The Beatle songs mentioned in this when your done like I was. :)     Also, I want to make a point in suggesting this novel to fans of Jackson Pearce's As You Wish because for some reason this novel had the same kind of feel that Jackson's debut did in my opinion!
B000DN5W4I|2.0|Joe is great so let's get that out of the way.  It's the idiots and incompetent boobs that call themselves directors(?) that ruin the greatness of performances such as these.  Who in their right mind would say, \\"I know I can make Joe's performance even better\\" or worse they feel they have to leave their mark. . . . and by the way they certainly do.  It didn't take long for me to sigh and say \\"Oh no!!!!!!!!!!!\\" only one or two minutes into the video.  Concert DVD lovers know what happenes next.  A montage of shots from every conceivable angle, (yes and even a couple upside-down) with not one lasting more than 3 seconds (I am not exargerating), shots from behind pillars and from the back of the room over the heads of the audience.  Well it is true that when I attend a concert I shake my head constantly, blink my eyes 1,000 times a minute, jump up and down, look around at everything and everyone exceprt the artist I came to see so in that regard maybe I should have rated this 5 star.  I jest of course.  I don't plan on watching this DVD again the only thing it will be good for is to use as a CD of a live performance.    I often wonder if the artists performing in these shows have any input into the editing or if they even view the final products.    If you're a diehard Bonamassa fan then perhaps you need this to fill out your collection but I believe that others would be better served by picking up Joe's Royal Albert Hall 2 DVD set.  It's awesome.    Unfortunately there are far too many concert DVDs on the market such as this where the directors, or editors, or both feel they are superior to the talents they are assigned to document.  OK, I make exceptions for vids from the 60s & 70s because they just couldn't help themselves but this is the 21st Century now.  My suggestion is to take all these egomanical idiots and commit them to the Ludevico Medical Center and submit them to the same treatment as Alex de Large in the book/film Clockwork Orange.  Sit them in a chair unable to move or shut their eyes and force them to vid every unwatchable concert video ever made.    I apologize for not commenting more on the music quality of the DVD.  As I said earlier Joe is great, but just as you were expecting a music review and got something different so I was deceived when I thought I was buying a concert video and received this \\"other\\" thing.    I believe that rating a concert video I should take into account all aspects of the production not only the performance of the artist so that is the reason for a 2 star rating.  Certainly if I were to rate only his playing in the video it would be 5 stars.
B00275EGX8|2.0|If you want to see a \\"seat of your pants thriller\\" and a \\"great 'war' film\\"...go somewhere else.    This movie was bad from the begining.  I am a Navy EOD Tech.  This was supposed to be our \\"Top Gun\\" for the EOD Community.  All this did was paint EOD as a bunch of wild cowboys.  Now, I'll spare you the inter-service jabbing I'd normally give my breathern in the Army...but this movie was REALLY REALLY BAD!!!    Any number of stunts the character did in the movie would've seen him sent home rather quickly.  Speaking on the \\"EOD/military technical aspect\\" of the film...it blew chuncks.  Hard.  As a movie...it still blew.  There were a number of scenes that should've been on the cutting room floor, as they didn't flow or even need to be in the film.  Example - a couple of scenes with the kid selling pirate DVDs.  The sniper scene...LOL...horrible.  The scene was there to have the two team members finally \\"bond\\" because up until then they'd been butting heads.  That scene could've been shot is a number of different scenarios and been much shorter.  I couldn't concentrate on the \\"male bonding\\" as I was laughing so hard from the Iraqi sniper killing (in a rather rapid rate) moving targets, then couldn't hit the EOD team for the rest of the day as the EOD team was stationary.  P.S.  EOD does in fact use the Barrett, but I'm not sure how much Army EOD spends on the weapon system and is well versed in calling windage and setting dopes.  Few of us in the Navy know how.    I won't bore you with the NUMEROUS military/EOD errors in the film...but it's A LOT!!!!!! (this is soooo hard not writing them all down)    This movie was a bore as well.  I'm not sure why there's so much hype for it being a \\"seat of your pants thrill ride\\".  It's not.  The only good thing about the movie are the following:  -The close up of the car rust being displaced by the blast wave was cool.  Great cinematography for THAT shot.  -The movie is not preachy as almost ALL current films about Iraq are.  Thefilm is neither pro-war or anti-war.    Well....that's about it.  Borrow it from a friend.  Don't waste your money buying the film and don't waste your time renting or downloading off the internet....
B00005JN0T|2.0|What a boring movie. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, but not by much. Every scene begins with a door sliding open to reveal Will Smith (of whom, I can't say I'm a fan) and/or his dialogue partner (I don't dare call much of what anyone does in this 'acting'). I've never seen Bridget Moynahan in anything else, and I hope the trend continues--what a bland, monotonous person.  The commentary is likewise boring, and repetitive, with pretty much nothing interesting to offer... much like the movie.   The only bright point would be Alan Tudyk's performance as Sonny the robot. Capable actors James Cromwell, Bruce Greenwood, and Chi McBride are all pretty much wasted in bland background roles, in favor of Will Smith's wise-cracking good cop with a troubled past cliche--I mean, 'character'. At least they didn't find a way to shoehorn one of his songs into the movie. Watch it only if you must.

B00013BN4S|5.0|When this album came out in 1975, I was an unabashed Dead Head.  Still, there was an openness to many types of music, and Emmylou definitely came up on our radar screen, largely due to the very traditional nature of her song selection and the beauty and heartfelt quality of her voice.  Last year, I happened to find this remastered CD in the bargain bin at a local book and music store and immediately grabbed it up.  After putting it on, it did not take me long to remember why Emmylou's music was so captivating when I first was exposed to it--it's simple, straightforward, honest, rootsy, and well done.  While the song that Emmylou co-penned with Bill Danoff, \\"Boulder to Birmingham,\\" probably is my favorite on \\"Pieces of the Sky,\\" there is no question that she had an amazing ability to interpret the songs of other artists.  In particular, her covers of Rodney Crowell's \\"Bluebird Wine,\\" the Louvin brother's \\"If I Could Only Win Your Love,\\" Merle Haggard's \\"Bottle Let Me Down,\\" and Shel Silverstein's \\"Queen of the Silver Dollar\\" are excellent, as is her cover of the extra track, \\"Hank and Lefty\\" on the remastered CD.  \\"Pieces of the Sky\\" was the debut album for Emmylou Harris--check it out to hear how this wonderful artist began her long and incredible recording career.  Highly recommended

I bought them at a store in Charleston, S.C. and had then sent home to my kids. You can get them there ... email for the store in Charleston is toms.toys@att.net.  They can ship. My kids LOVE the blocks and created lots of different towers and shapes... different from what they can do with magnatiles.  I bought the set of 200 (for $[...] - - not the ridiculous prices on Amazon) and likely will order more.
B000I0QM04|5.0|I really feel this movie didn't get the credit it deserves by both critics and people that watched it, I don't understand what was it they didn't like about it or what was it they expected from it, yes I agree the script was not the greatest but the special effects more than makes up for it and the acting was very good as well but to me what takes the cake is the feel of the movie 1940's noir kind of thing I wish they would make more movies like this. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.!!!
B001BJ6918|4.0|Arrived before Xmas which was good. No complaints from beneficiary. I liked the fact I was kept advised of the location of the product as it moved through the shipping maze.
6305428557|5.0|Hugh Grant is up to his usual antics and bumbling charm in this quaint Welsh tale based on a true story (which makes it all the more compelling.)  Tara Fitzgerald is similarly magnetic and sweet.  Every character in this film is spot-on and likeable in their own way.  High production value, beautiful scenery, first class acting, writing and directing, one can't go wrong with this moving story set during WW I in a small Welsh town.  It's truly amazing how this entire village comes together (against the odds) because of their pride for Wales' first \\"Mountain.\\"  A must see for Romantics, Anglophiles, and anyone who appreciates first-class quality movie making.
0783232039|5.0|Charles Lee Ray, has his body parts being held at a criminal evidence station in the form of a small doll known as the famous Chucky. When his old-time sweet heart, Tiffany, picks up his remaining limbs and puts them back together, she performs a ritual that revives the murderous maniac. But Chucky decides that he wants another individual to help him with his dirty work. So he kills Tiffany, and then revives her as a \\"doll bride\\". When they decide to spend their honeymoon with another happy couple on the highway, it becomes another murder spree. With a \\"blood-bath on wheels\\" and two murderous dolls, the human couples find that this was going to be a \\"Highway To Hell\\" in this gruesome film of blood and gore and a little bit of Chucky & Tiffany. Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total entertainment from start to finish, great humour & horror, never becomes boring or dull. Highly reccomended for die-hard fans of the \\"Child's Play\\" series.
B0000542D2|4.0|Let me start by addressing the problem of the video transfers, screen resolution and all the other technobabble Amazon reviewers sometimes use: Ignore it. If you're a normal person who enjoys watching movies you'll probably not notice any of their complaints. Aside from a few people who will complain that the lip syncing is off, which is totally true, they aren't very noticeable to a regular person who isn't trying to build themselves the 'perfect' home movie system or anything along those lines.    That being said, if you haven't seen the movie, I seriously reccommend it. It's incredible in it's own strange way. It doesn't have a plot, nor does it have an antagonist, and it barely even focuses on the music, really. The best way I could describe it is the camera's following the Beatles for a couple of days- it meanders off, doesn't have a plot at all, etc. etc., but that's it's charm. You can pick up from anywhere and by the end of the scene you'll be hooked on the movie.    The reason that even a Beatles hater could like it is, well, because of those very points. It's cheeky and fun, and it's not serious at all.     The only problem I have is with the special features. It has almost no involvement from the Beatles, instead having cast interviews and things like that, with not much of a word from any of the Beatles. Not even Paul or Ringo, who you'd expect it to have atleast a little involvement with.    All in all, if you haven't seen it, buy it. It's great.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Young Andy Barclay sees a commercial for a 'Good Guy' doll on TV, and asks his mother for one for his birthday. At work, Andy's mom and her friend discover a peddler selling one for a low price, and she buys it. What she doesn't know is that the particular doll contains the spirit of Charles Lee Ray, aka 'The Lakeshore Strangler', who died at the hands of police the night before and had transferred his spirit to the doll by voodoo. That night, Andy's babysitter is pushed from their 5th-floor window to her death, and only young Andy knows that 'Chucky' the doll  is responsible for that a death and a series of murders that follow. Worse than that, the soul of Charles Lee Ray is trying to get out of the doll's body and take over Andy's. The movie builds up suspense in the beginning and then takes off once \\"Chucky\\" comes to life. It almost takes half the movie for that to happen. It stays intense from that point and certainly keeps your attention. This is a truly interesting horror movie.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I've loved all the Harry Potter movies, and this one is great as well.  Blu-ray Rocks!
B0012EM5D8|4.0|When the bee Barry B. Benson graduates from college, he finds that he will have only one job for his entire life, and absolutely disappointed, he joins the team responsible for bringing the honey and pollination of the flowers to visit the world outside the hive. Once in Manhattan, he is saved by the florist Vanessa and he breaks the bee law to thank Vanessa. They become friends and Barry discovers that humans exploit bees to sell the honey they produce. Barry decides to sue the human race, with destructive consequences to nature. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. Some of the bee hive interior and flight scenes were just breathtaking. This movie has lighthearted humor with playful animation for the entire family.
B001GCUNWQ|3.0|I was greatly pleased with the time frame this seller had with my item, however when I received the item I didn't open it for a while seeing as it was a Christmas present for my son. When we did manage to open it the previews wouldn't play and we had to mess with it in order to get the movie to play. The movie itself plays fine so we decided to keep it.   Other than this problem we had a decent experience.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Sandy Olsen is a goody two shoes from Austrailia, Danny Zuko is the head T-Bird from Rydell High. However when the two meet up during the summer, they fall in love. But when the summer ends, the two think they'll never see each other again. However they're both wrong, Sandy and her parents have moved to America and she is now attending Danny's school. When the two discover that they attend the same school, there is a lot of debate over whether they can still be together since it's uncool for Danny to be in love with a goody goody like Sandy. However the two, against all odds, manage to stay together. Then graduation comes and Sandy is about to change in a way no one expected. The vocals in this movie are outstanding, with the breath-taking voice of Olivia Newton-John, and John Travolta's rock numbers. It's a timeless hit that will have people enjoying it throughout the ages.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|...I was asked by amazon to create this review.    I mainly bought this because of the 24 bit FLAC files. And I can only repeat what has been said already. The sound of them is awesome! Even as a Beatles fan, like me, who knows every second of the back catalog, I am amazed by the clarity and punch of the sound - and I also hear a clear difference to the remastered CDs - it's hard to describe it, but it's really like sitting next to the band listening to the guys recording the stuff. A pity the catalog was not released in DVD-Audio- or SACD format - e.g. like the Stones did in 2002. But I have now tranferred the FLAC files to DVD-Audio-format - by using the program 'DVD-Audiofile'. Then I burned these 'image'-files to DVD+R's (with 'ImgBurn'), as I am not so into listening to music on my laptop - I know I am old-fashioned, I just simply like to have the records in my hands :-)). This only works if you have a DVD-Audio-player (not a DVD-Video). The reason is that DVD-Video only supports 48 or 96 kHz - and the FLAC files are 44,1 kHz. (I don't know if it would work to convert from 44,1 to 48 - whether the sound gets distorted then - has anyone tried it?)     But however you listen to the FLAC's, I can tell you: 24 bit is it! Finally this incredible music is presented in the form it deserves!
0783225547|5.0|A vulcanologist arrives at a countryside named Dante's Peak after his boss instructs him to investigate the possibility of a dormant volcano (Dante's Peak) getting active again in that region. As story progresses, we see that Dalton is getting increasingly convinced that the volcano might blow up but his boss is reluctant to declare an emergency in the city yet because of possibility that if the volcano finally does never erupt, the real estate prices will plummet anyway and the city might loose a huge financial investment deal. Unfortunately, the common residents of the area know nothing about it until very late. Finally, when Dante's Peak does erupt, the city panics, some does not survive the catastrophe, including Dalton's boss and for Dalton and the mayor of the city who falls in love with Dalton and her children, it becomes a race against the pyroclastic cloud to save their own lives. There is plenty of good action and it really keeps you on the edge of your seats. Pierce & Linda gave outstanding performances and the photography was great through out the entire movie. Very entertaining.

B00005JN4H|5.0|Belle Williams is a speed demon. Flying through the streets of New York in her tricked-out taxi, she's earned a rep as New York's fastest cabbie. But driving a hack is only a pit stop for her real dream: Belle wants to be a race car champion. And she's well on her way, until she's derailed by overeager cop Andy Washburn, whose undercover skills are matched only by his total ineptitude behind the wheel. Washburn, whose lack of vehicular skills has landed him in the precinct doghouse, is hot on the heels of a gang of beautiful Brazilian bank robbers, led by Vanessa, their cold, calculating and leggy leader. To nab the evasive crooks, drivers license less Washburn convinces Belle to team up with him to pursue Vanessa and crew. Belle has carte blanche to drive at any speed and break any law. The car less cop and speed demon cabbie New York's unlikeliest partners begin a high-speed game of cat and mouse with the robbers. That is, if Belle and Washburn don't end up killing each other first. The action is fast, and the chase scenes are just great. Taxi is a good time because of the rest of the cast and the storyline is fast paced action.  Queen Latifah alone is worth watching.

B000H5U832|4.0|Lightning McQueen, a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The animation in this movie is gorgeous, and the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. This is movie is worth seeing.
B000BNI99K|5.0|This CD set is amazing.  When I got it, I thought that my boyfriend would think it was sappy, but he ended up playing the CD's continuous while working in the garage.  I am a hyper romantic so I love all of these great old songs and Rod does a masterful job.  As someone else said though, I could do without the duet \\"Baby it's cold outside\\" with Dolly Parton.  She sounds skrechy and like an old woman.  Everyone who hears the CD set loves it--of all ages.
B000MV9026|5.0|In the cold land of Antarctica, the Emperor Penguins each express their true love with a special heartsong of their own that expresses their very being. However, the misfit Mumble cannot sing, but instead has an extraordinary talent to tap dance with almost magical energy and expression. Nevertheless, the deeply conformist leadership of the colony fearfully blames the young penguin's unorthodox ways for the lean fishing that threatens them all. Defiant in the face of unjust rejection, Mumble and his true friends set out to find the true cause of the famine. Through the motley crew's trials and perils, Mumble learns many things about his frozen world, not the least of which being that his toe tapping talent may be what he needs to save his people. This movie is a feel-good animated movie that works on a few different levels; it will make you laugh, cry, and make you tap your toes or bounce your leg. Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. This movie is definitely worth watching with your kids.
B002SR2PKG|2.0|I love \\"It\\", and since I hadn't read it in a long time, it was one of the first books I purchased for my Kindle.  To my surprise, I found myself reading something like an early draft that had never been touched by an editor. Except, I doubt that Stephen King, even in an early draft, would have replaced \\"l\\" with the number one and \\"o\\" with zero.  That's the sort of thing you'll be dealing with in the Kindle edition of \\"It\\".<br /><br />In addition to random number/letter substitution, there are numerous typos (\\"Deny\\" instead of \\"Derry\\" comes up a lot), massive formatting issues w/r/t italics, and some words that have been so poorly formatted that you cannot even tell what they originally were.  A couple examples, since I highlighted some of the more egregious ones as I went along:<br /><br />\\"... next to the scrawny, gantryhke edifice that was Silver.\\"  I had to look this up online to figure out that \\"gantryhke\\" is supposed to be \\"gantry like\\".<br /><br />\\"...the books on the shelves marked CURRENT ncnON--SEVEN-DAY-LOAN.\\"  \\"ncnON\\" is supposed to be \\"FICTION\\", of course.<br /><br />The last example I won't quote for fear of spoilers, but it says \\"emergency mom\\" instead of \\"emergency room\\". Sigh.<br /><br />There is a LOT of this sort of error in the Kindle edition of \\"It\\".  There are also entire sentences that have been spliced or duplicated in strange ways, so that you'll read the first half of a sentence twice in a row, then the second half.  It's not a great reading experience and I imagine if Mr. King knew about it, he wouldn't be delighted either!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Cd arrived in great condition just like the detailed description stated!!! I would purchase again... Arrived in time and very nicely :)
B001O7JHVG|3.0|The first half of the film plods along, pacing slow.  Picks up better after the prison stuff.  Loved this movie when I was short, but after watching things like Lie to Me, Criminal Minds, Castle, NCIS, I'm afraid I've set up higher expectations.  Don't get me wrong.  Love the actors (even the villian), just wanted the plot to kick into high gear a bit earlier (like, say, at the beginning)...    Put yourself in a 70s or 80s frame of mind, and it should be perfect.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I noticed this book when my brother and I were watching the previews for the movie. I went right to my kindle when he said that it was a good book an believe me  he does not like many books. I sampled the first book and loved it even before I finished the sample. Then I went ahead and read the samples of the other four books and  it was the same thing for each one and now I'm holding back from going to the library so that I can save my allowance and buy them all for $35.55 so that I can read them all on my Kindle for the first time.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Have been a Beatles fan for 37 years (day 1). Can't feel anything but true awe for their music.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Great video, great archival video of Bob Dylan and many influential folk singers, great in depth coverage of influences on Dylan, and a real look at how he came about and how he created music, and his own views on himself. Others viewed him as a prophet, I think he viewed himself as a guitar playing singer. He was just trying to make music and wrote stuff that others found profound. A real history lesson and takes you back to the 60's and 70's. I went to High School in Duluth MN. Bob went to High School in Hibbing MN, before me, but the video captures the times, and to know where he came from and what he became is an amazing transformation. The video does a good job of showing the change as it played out. He is an gifted music creator, and has done incredible things with a voice that would not be considered classically great.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|No one like Jimi. An amazing musician who died way too early. Much missed, and greatly appreciated by all who actually know and play music.

1416585710|5.0|LISEY'S STORY<br /><br />For me, Stephen King is one of those authors who can do no wrong.  He can take any subject matter, any genre, and make it work.<br /><br />We meet Lisey Landon whose husband is one of the most famous authors in the world.  What is it like to be married to him?  Lisey tells her tale and within her story there are many other stories.<br /><br />Scott Landon comes from a troubled past.  Writing seems to help him deal with his childhood, plus make him the big bucks.  He is married to Lisey.  Scott has many demons in his life and meeting Lisey has been his salvation.  He tells her of his messed up childhood and a secret magical horrible place he can journey to.  Lisey's love for Scott has no boundaries, not even the final boundary of death.  Their love is forever and always.<br /><br />We read about Lisey and her sisters, their lives as children, Scott's tortured childhood, their life as man and wife, and just for the fun and suspense of it all, about a mad stalker who makes life a living hell for Lisey.  All of these story lines are woven and meshed into one great big fat juicy read of a book.<br /><br />King doesn't disappoint with things that go bump in the night, both the human and unknown type of monster.  King doesn't fail to scare you or give you goose bumps or drop your jaw in total surprise at what happens in this book.<br /><br />I loved how he wrote about a strong loving relationship between two people and still made things scary.  I loved how he wrote about the love between sisters and family.  I loved how he wrote such a good book that I didn't want to stop reading it or when I wasn't reading it I couldn't stop thinking about the characters and story and what would happen next.<br /><br />This is a book that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam
B000IJ79WU|1.0|It is almost a completely different movie than the theatre (Lester cut) version. Perhaps this version makes sense to Donner, but it is far less entertaining than the Lester version. There are many continuity problems and plot inconsistencies. The movie appears flat and lifeless. The ending is absolutely horrible!     Only buy this version if you're really into THAT into superman or film making. It contains interesting footage which has never been seen before.
B000MCH5P4|2.0|The feeling is of being trapped in a nightmare-everything that can go wrong will go wrong(the marrocan kids will shoot someone, japanese girl will get in some trouble, something will go wrong with the kids in Mexico), you don't really grasp the whole story and you can't wake up.And when you wake up you ask yourself why?   Otherwise, too long, good performance of characters, some disturbing scenes, and the biggest problem is that the story doesn't catch you.
0805091742|3.0|The Checklist Manifesto is a good book if you require convincing that checklists are a good thing.  Or if you like to read a quasi-novel on how checklists can be useful.  If you already believe in checklists then you may be bored with 193 pages espousing their virtue.  You will not find anything at all on how to construct a checklist, or methods to keep them current amid ever-changing procedures and technological advances.  Well written, but not particularly practical.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|It was entertaining and scary under the circumstance--try watching it alone in your house, in the dark, late at night after a couple of margaritas.  On a night when the wind is blowing and things are creaking and bumping the house outside.  I must be a total weenie, because I was scared to death, under those circumstances.<br /><br />In the harsh light of day (not to mention sobriety), I watched parts of it again.  My observations are these:<br /><br />#1.  As others have noted, I would have done several things differently.  Ouija board?  I would have cracked it over Micah's head immediately.  Then I would have packed my bags and headed for some bright and sunny location.  Possibly Cancun.<br /><br />#2.  Why didn't these two knuckleheads turn on the d@mn lights occasionally?  I say, and will stand by the assertion that IF YOU EVER WATCH YOUR GIRLFRIEND BEING DRAGGED DOWN THE HALLWAY BY HER FEET BY A DEMON, TURN THE LIGHTS ON, OK?<br /><br />#3.  Lastly, if your girlfriend is holding a crucifix, and its burning her hands to the point where they are bleeding....I think its ok to go ahead and just call 911 at that point.  Immediately.  And if she tries to tell you that AFTER THIS, she thinks \\"We'll be ok now\\"...go ahead and leave her there to nap undisturbed, possibly forever.  You just go ahead and take care of numero Uno under these circumstances.
B002BX2LEM|4.0|The Wrestler yeah I'm the last mother f***er to see it. Mickey Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson a popular Pro Wrestler in the 80's Marisa Tomei plays Pam or Cassidy her stripper name Evan Rachel Wood plays Stephine she's Randy's estranged daughter.

You just know he's going to die it has a tragic ending.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|This CD is simply awesome. The music on it is very engaging and the mix of upbeat and slower songs is near perfect. Duffy has a very soulful voice and reminds me of a young Diana Ross. If she were to put together a tribute album of Diana Ross songs it would be killer! There's not much new music these days that get me excited but Duffy, along with One Republic, have gotten my attention. The song \\"Mercy\\" is an instant classic and \\"Stepping Stone\\" has a wonderful vibe that you'd swear came straight from Motown. Do yourself a favor and give this CD a listen.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie considering it came from Hollywood.      There was no blaring soundtrack that had me jumping for the remote control to lower the volume every minute (only to have to turn the volume back up afterwards so that I could hear what actors were saying).  There was some intelligence to the way the story unfolded.  The pacing was very un-Hollywood like.  There were even extended scenes of pure dialog(!).    It was very revealing that the director even mentioned on the audio commentary track how nervous he was about what I thought was the most riveting scene in the whole movie- When Sisters James & Aloysius confronted Father Flynn regarding their suspicions involving his conduct with a student.  Only a Hollywood director would consider this a \\"risky\\" scene because it contained so much extended dialog that would challenge the attention spans of the masses.  In fact, he felt compelled to break the \\"monotony\\" a bit with exploding lightbulbs and such just to \\"spice\\" things up a bit.  Pretty sad commentary really.    At any rate, first rate movie.  Great acting.  Very compelling.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Despite the \\"critics\\" slamming this film, it was surprisingly intriguing and held my attention. The story is the typical \\"bad seed\\" underneath and the perfect child in appearance. Isabelle could turn it on and off at will or have a raging fit if she was frustrated. She seemed to be everywhere watching everyone in her adopted family.  Watching he r breaking her own arm was gruesome and showed the depth of her psychosis.  Some of the thriller aspect became more \\"horror\\" like at times.  I didn't watch the alternate ending which may have been preferable!  All in all the standard story was saved by excellent acting by Vera, Peter and Isabelle; dubbing was well done.  Donna
0316017922|1.0|While I have no intention of deeply and thoroughly dismantling Gladwell's argument, I will merely note that this book, as well as his others, is flawed and flimsy, laking rigor and originality.  His assumptions are not well founded, his extrapolations not well-defended --- this is the kind of work that would be shredded if presented as an undergraduate thesis at some undistinguished institution in some jerk-water corner of the country.  He is writer of mediocre talent, who, when compared to his cohorts at New Yorker  --- Adam Glopnik, et. al. --- causes any reader of intelligence to consider just what kind of goods does he have on the editors of that esteemed magazine.  He is the non-fiction world's John Grishom whose work will appeal to those who want to appear au courant and hip, the kind of person who wants to impress his computer date over a plate of risotto.
B000SOO6JO|4.0|Tom Selleck nearly always seems to find the perfect character that fits his style. Author Robert Parker's Jesse Stone fits like a glove.  Sometimes there is a little too much \\"ruminating\\" on Stone's part : sitting in his beach house   trying to decide to have or not a third alcoholic drink and wishing he could get over his attachment to his ex-wife. But his laid back style of finding the bad guys is straight forward and moves along to an action-filled ending.Enjoyable drama/mystery and he has a beautiful dog (Parker trademark). Donna Melendez
B001UI1M26|5.0|I thought this was the most awesome movie I'd ever seen and I have watched it many times. I am a huge fan of Hugh Jackman but Brandon Walters won my heart from the start.  He played Nullah perfectly. I thought Nichole Kidman did a good job of acting also.  It all came together very well I thought.
B000A6T262|1.0|This boxed set is very disappointing. Star Trek The Motion Picture has been turned into a bastardized version of the original film, specifically for this release. The new version even includes redone special effects. The original special effects almost won the movie an academy award, it was nominated, so why redo them. The menus chosen seem lazy and are awkward and hard to use on some of the movies. The transfers are not very good, I thought I was watching a VHS some of the time. I felt like they'd cleaned up a VHS copy of the movie, except for that the VHS versions were never in widescreen.  They could have done a better job with this box set. Like the menus the entire box set seems lazy and lacking any effort. I never bought any of the movies on DVD and one night I rented them and now I know why. I now own them on blu-ray and they're amazing. Buy the blu-ray box set because what it is, the DVD box set should have been.    This box set was created during a time when DVD was the greatest home video experience and the companies releasing them had not developed a complete understanding of how to approach the technology they had so they decided to approach every movie as if it were the ultimate version of that film and reedit the thing into a huge mess pretending the original version never existed. This is what the Star Trek DVD boxed set is, a huge mess of substandard quality video and lame awkward menus. If you do not have a blu-ray player, and do not care about widescreen, I would recommend buying the VHS box set and an old non flat screen picture tube TV to watch them on. It will look just as good as the DVD box set and save you money.
B001JNNDGA|1.0|What's it called when you charge to watch someone get tortured for 2 hours? A snuff film, and that's exactly what this is. This is the most violent movie made in recent years, and it's accepted because religion is pushing it. The only reason that it is not in English is because they needed the subtitles to distract you from the blood being splashed all over the screen. This movie is also incredibly anti Semitic and blames the Jews for the death of Christ. If you need a religious movie in your collection, get the 10 Commandments. That movie is fantastic.
B00275EGWY|4.0|I'm not part of the military and know nothing about IEDs, but all i can say is that this is a great film. It's one that will shake you to your core. One of the most memorable lines for me was during the beginning of the sniper scene when they were shooting all around at an unknown target and one says something like, \\"What are we shooting at?\\" and someone else goes, \\"I don't know!\\" This scene really says a lot about the war we're fighting in Iraq. We have no real target there. Do we even know exactly what we're looking for? I don't know, but this movie has a lot to say. It's really great. I recommend seeing it.
B000CNE092|3.0|This was a gift for my daughter as this was her favorite Disney movie as a child.  She isn't fond of the cover and doesn't think that it is completely sealed either.  She has yet to view it, but I think she will be happy when she does.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|The trailer says it all; and yet, watching it in full doesn't provide too much more, except for the occasional weird (and, in once instance, very touching) plot twists. A film of long dialogue-intensive scenes (very long - the opener, especially, lasts forever, as does the long \\"basement bar\\" scene), it really could have done with some trimming. But... apparently, there were deleted scenes and new characters aplenty, including one created for Maggie Cheung!  (Huh?! How could you get Maggie Cheung to be in your film and then not use the footage?!?)<br /><br />Nice use of German and French and Italian, which is welcome for people who are not monolingual, but the film lacks a main character. Who is the film's protagonist? It's not Brad Pitt, nor any of the people on the movie poster. If anything, it's Shosanna Dreyfus, who is central to the opening scene as well as the main plot, but she doesn't have much screen time. Sure, the Basterds are busy striking fear in the Nazi's heart, but do we really care?<br /><br />What is interesting about the film itself is how two circumstantial plots come together to ensure the outcome, which I don't think I've seen in a film before. The other thing that is interesting is that the film appears to be leading to a sequel; I would think that part two could be more interesting than part one. Altogether it's a bit of a rarity - a film with a good plot/ending that doesn't do a great job establishing (most of) the characters.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This really makes our Christmas merry!  I liked the value for this 2-disc set.  I prefer watching the B/W version, but color is nice too.  Delivery was great, got it when promised.
0307346617|5.0|I had heard about this book and was intrigued; I'm not really very into zombies, but this book somehow sounded like a lot of fun, the way it is described in reviews as somewhat of a &quot;rewriting future history&quot; that you'd get in a political thriller about World War III, conspiracies to start a nuclear war, etc etc etc, except with 30% more zombies. But it wasn't at first - the first 100 pages, with a series of episodes that are mostly 3-10 pages long (although some are longer - one of the best is 22 pages long), tells dozens of stories of encroaching horror, and then the eventual human massacre at the hands of howling zombies.<br /><br />The whole book is a series of &quot;oral accounts&quot;, as if they were TV documentary interviews with survivors of the Zombie War, that discuss their experiences. The interviews cover top politicians and businessmen, army brass, military grunts, survivalists, average people, and in once case a recovered feral child (i.e. an orphan who regressed into primitive savagery in order to survive). The chapters recount the rise of the zombies, how they nearly overwhelmed humanity, and how the nations fought their way back from near-extinction. The way the novel is organised like an academic text tells it all: Introduction - Warnings - Blame - The Great Panic - Turning the Tide - Home Front USA - Around the World, and Above - Total War - Good-byes. The story roams from early detections in China, human transporters smuggling infected people into other countries, barricades in Greece and the Ukraine, early cases in Brazil, escaping zombie swarms in South Africa, Israeli academics' early recognition of the scourge and the resulting solution, the CIA reaction, short-term solutions, Anatarctic holdouts for troubled billionaires, middle-American fortifications, the scene of massive tragedies in India, background to a limited nuclear exchange, the mutiny of a nuclear sub, the sacrifice of space station occupants working to keep satellite technology together, adventures in the Russian army and the way of the new Holy Russian Empire, mercenaries paid by billionaires for protection, the US Army's first disaster in Yonkers and the German armed forces' rout in Hamburg, South Africa and a strategic solution, the disastrous northern trail (when zombies freeze, the cold becomes a protection of sorts), a military resurgence in the US, how Hollywood filmmakers were put to work, mid-crisis politics, urban zombie cleansing, surviving &quot;behind the lines&quot;, European castles and sieges, the setting up of global information networks and ultimate geopolitics, Korea's zombie DMZ, a Japanese otaku zombie killer, a Japanese Zatoichi zombie killer, psychological warfare, using dogs against zombies, the first successful campaigns and zombie massacres, and cleansing remaining zombie hordes in the oceans and seas (where they don't fester) and in the Paris catacombs. There are many very good episodes, with the best being the ones from Japan, the nuclear sub story, as well as the ones describing political phenomena, economic shifts, and general psychology of fighting a totally new kind of war.<br /><br />Thinking about the book like an academic text is useful, since Brooks goes into the processes of understanding the threat, the inevitable instance of profiteering from the fear caused by the zombie scourge when it was still little-understood, the psychology of those involved in bringing humanity back from the brink - where it teetered before the sudden, exponentially monstrous zombie assault - and finally triumphing by rescuing it from extinction. It's no secret that the humans, whose chances were not even 50:50 at one point in the book, did mop up the zombies (also called Zs, Zack and Zed-heads, or Gs - as in ghouls) in the end. The book couldn't have been written if the zombies had triumphed, as there would have been no one left to write it; but write it Brooks did. while there is yet no hint of a Second World War Z, there are already spin-offs aplenty in the form of The Zombie Survival Guide, The Zombie Survival Guide - Recorded Attacks, and surely many more to come. And a film, of course, since so very many scenes of the book are perfectly suited to the cinema; personally, I can't wait to watch the US Army slaughtering zombies to the tune of Iron Maiden's &quot;The Trooper&quot; like it's described on page 278 of my copy of the book. Rock `n' roll!, there are already spin-offs aplenty in the form of The Zombie Survival Guide, The Zombie Survival Guide - Recorded Attacks, and surely many more to come. And a film, of course, since so very many scenes of the book are perfectly suited to the cinema; personally, I can't wait to watch the US Army slaughtering zombies to the tune of Iron Maiden's &quot;The Trooper&quot; like it's described on page 278 of my copy of the book.

B000002LMK|3.0|I love Neil Young, I've been obsessed for years. He's put out a huge variety of music. Some of his stuff is not my style, but I respect him so mush as a musician and song writer that I can learn to love his different types of music. Even some Lucky13 stuff has grown on me. (Landing on Water...glad he didn't stick with it, but that album's kinda fun ;) ). I'm glad he found good ole rock and roll again with Ragged Glory...yea, kinda. Even the tracks I don't mind, Neil sometimes sounds like a first-round American Idol contestant. Seriously people, NY has a unique voice and that's what we like about him. But he's off-key all over the place on this album. Other hardcore NY fans, admit it. He and Crazy Horse whipped this album up on a Saturday afternoon. I know, I know, that's why some of you like the album; it sounds raw. But that fine line of raw sound and bad singing was crossed. I think some 5-star reviewers would give NY a good review if he made an album of farts. Ragged Glory isn't totally forgettable, but it blows me away that people would give it 5-star. 5-star for Harvest Moon, Live Rust, Weld, Everybody Knows.., maybe Gold Rush. there's so many good NY albums, but Ragged Glory? Just some blah rock quickly put together.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|A film about sacrifices. While everyone who has seen the trailer will know that this is the story of a small snow-bound Swedish town haunted by a vampire, what is truly awesome about it is the fragility of each character, and how they all crumble in one way or another. Eli's sacrifices, Oskar's sacrificies, Virginia's sacrifice, Håkan's sacrifice...  The film is beautiful and minimal, and we care about all of the characters. The love story between two 12-year-olds is somehow quite believable. The theme of bullyism is a bit clumsy, and provides a bit of non-vampire action. The book, apparently, also deals with alcoholism, drug use, and pedophilia - wow, pack it all in between the vampirism and murder.<br /><br />This film is very highly recommended.
B001GM28HO|4.0|I bought this last summer and I really enjoyed listening to the whole track. Now? The songs are so over-played everywhere like \\"Poke her face\\" and \\"Just Prance\\" that I don't enjoy listening to it anymore. Lady Gaga, who says the artists names at least twice within every song, is a very talented singer. I don't even mind all the synthesizing because her real voice sounds good. If you're not completely tired of the songs, I'd say buy it. Otherwise, I haven't recommended this for purchase since September 09
B002KREVE2|5.0|This came with a CD and a DVD. I love Leonard Cohen so much, I didn't know how to take a new artifact from his musical work that included both a CD and a DVD.  Should I listen to him first, or should I watch him? Out of necessity, I listened to him first - it was probably the right thing to do. All but three of the songs he played at this festival are from his first two albums, and as a total aspect it was just like listening to Leonard Cohen's greatest hits as I remember it, with wonderful new inter-song poetry as we have heard on other, later Leonard Cohen live pieces. It was not the full-on live stage concert spectacle, it was Leonard Cohen as he was in 1970, and people in those days understood him and what he was saying, he was one of them. It's amazing how we wander on and wander apart, and how people like Leonard Cohen only matter at certain, brief moments in history. Cohen has 11 studio albums and five live releases (of which I have three). This is the oldest one, although \\"Live Songs\\" has material that reaches back to 1970 as well; \\"Field Commander Cohen\\", from 1979, is a polished affair of polite applause, with a crack band and a groovy bass player (not to mention the violin, oud and clainet), but it is also a bit too speedy for the Cohen groove. I have not yet heard \\"Cohen Live\\" (recorded in 1988 and 1993) or \\"Live in London\\" (recorded in 2008).<br /><br />The CD was recorded on August 30th, 1970 and is nearly 80 minutes long and contains 14 songs (with five sections of pre-song banter, all in the first half of the concert, that last from 16 seconds to nearly three minutes). It was the last day of the five day long festival, with the final sets by Joan Baez, Jimi Hendrix playing at midnight, and Cohen following Hendrix (he was the second-last artist to perform at the festival, which was closed by Richie Havens, who played \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" as the first rays of dawn hit). It is presented \\"warts and all\\", with a few incidents of onstage voltage zaps heard as people fiddle with equipment, most notable in Suzanne, one of Cohen's mellowest songs (not to mention his most famous).<br /><br />The recording starts off with Cohen's voice, \\"Are you guys ready? Is everybody ready?\\" Then the announcer comes on the PA saying \\"Our next artist is a novelist, a poet, an author, a singer and an album recorder.  He's been trying to get here since 10:30 yesterday morning... won't you welcome Leonard Cohen and his Army.\\"  Like all Cohen live recordings, there is plenty of cryptic between-song banter, and here Cohen starts off with a story of the circus and an appeal to the audience to hold up matches so that he could see them \\"sparkle like fireflies, each of you at your different heights,\\" he sounds elated, but he also notes \\"a lot of people without matches\\" (halfway through the concert again, he jibes \\"oh, we're sorely in need for matches\\"). He then launches into a shambolic impromptu song \\"Oh it's good to be here in front of 300,000 peopleeeee\\", then a very slow, sombre version of \\"Bird On A Wire,\\" that is mostly him and his guitar, but also has some bass, a bit of keyboard, and some background singers.<br /><br />For the most part, the songs sound like they're Cohen playing alone, even though he has two backup singers, a bassist and three seated guitarists up onstage with him (no drummer - Cohen's not about percussion).  The sound quality of the recording is excellent, and the production is top notch - the songs, except where Cohen improvises, sound like they did on the albums, and they are superb to listen to. \\"So Long Marianne\\", \\"You Know Who I Am\\", \\"Lady Midnight\\", \\"One of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\", \\"The Stranger Song\\", \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\", \\"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye\\", \\"Diamonds In The Mine\\", \\"Suzanne\\", \\"Sing Another Song, Boys\\", \\"The Partisan\\", \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" and one of my favourites, \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy,\\" to end the evening.<br /><br />The intro to \\"You Know Who I Am\\" has a short impromptu ditty called \\"Let's Renew Ourselves Now\\" that might be considered a unique new Leonard Cohen song - it is about 50 seconds long and starts with some Spanish guitar plucking, then the lyrics \\"I know it has been cold, and I know it has been damp/I know you've been sitting all night long\\"; the tempo of the song then picks up, and he says \\"Let's renew ourselves now, let's renew ourselves now, let's renew ourselves now,\\" then going directly into \\"You Know Who I Am.\\" Most of these songs came from his first two albums, \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" and \\"Songs From A Room\\"; the three from his not-yet-released album of 1971, \\"Songs of Love And Hate\\", are \\"Diamonds In The Mine\\", \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" and \\"Sing Another Song, Boys\\" - in fact, the version of \\"Sing Another Song, Boys\\" on that album was recorded at this concert, so this is technically the second time it appears on a Leonard Cohen album (oddly enough, the tracking puts the famous \\"Let's sing another song boys, this one has grown old and bit-ter\\" intro at the end of the preceding track, \\"Suzanne\\"; this is a mistake, as it is clearly an important part of the song). The song got resounding applause, something which is cut off of the version on \\"Songs of Love and Hate\\", which fades it out quickly after his last \\"la-la-la-la-la-la-LA-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laaaaaaaaaw\\".<br /><br />One of the highlights of the concert comes before \\"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong - one of his cornier songs, which he says he wrote in a peeling room in the Chelsea Hotel as he was coming off amphetamines and was pursuing a blonde lady whom he met in a Nazi poster, the courtship of which he describes even more cryptically - when he recites some poems: \\"As for the political situation: They locked up a man who wanted to rule the world/ The fools, they locked up the wrong man,\\" and \\"A man who eats meat wants to get his teeth into something/ A man who does not eat meat wants to get his teeth into something else/ If these thoughts interest you even for a moment you are lost.\\" He gets heckled once, to which he replies \\"Are you calling me a fascist pig again?\\"<br /><br />Besides a bit of organ and backing from the two female singers, the concert is relatively restrained - \\"The Stranger Song\\" seems to be just Cohen and his guitar - until the second bar of \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\", more than halfway through the concert, when The Army really kicks out the jams and all the members saw away, including the banjo player - Cohen just wails and wails !! (Incidentally, this recording of \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" also appears on \\"Leonard Cohen Live\\", which contains bits of his 1970 and 1972 live performances.) It is followed by a mellow version of \\"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye\\", but then comes an impromptu intro \\"They gave me some money for my sad and famous song/ They said `the crowd is waiting, hurry up or they'll be gone'/ But I could not change my style, and I guess I never will/ So I sing this song for the poison snakes on Devastation Hill/ And there are no letters in the mailbox...\\", which goes into a blistering version of \\"Diamonds In The Mine,\\" a song that the audience would not have heard until then. It is very similar to the album version, although I suppose a keen ear will hear different lyrics.<br /><br />Another interesting moment is when, just as he's playing the guitar into to \\"The Partisan\\", he says \\"I'd like to dedicate this song to \\"Joan Baez and the work she's doing.\\" The second-last song is \\"Famous Blue Raincoat,\\" another song that the audience wouldn't have heard yet, which Cohen introduces with the words \\"It's not that I want to be coy standing out here, you know, but I know that it's late and... I don't know, maybe this is good music to make love to. This song was written in the East Side, the east end of New York; It's four in the morning...\\"<br /><br />For his last song, he says \\"(to the audience) my guitar has been heisted... (to the band) yeah, the song about Nancy, that's a good idea. (to the audience again) I want to sing this song for Nancy; it was in 1961, she went into the bathroom and blew her head off with her brother's shotgun. And, in those days there was not this kind of horizontal support, and she was right where all of you are, but there was no one around - to light their matches.\\" He starts off with his solo voice and guitar, the bass comes in, then the voices drift in very subtly, some keyboard sounds, \\"Nancy wore green stockings, and she slept with everyone,\\" background vocals come in stronger, \\"we told her she was beautiful, we told her she was free/ But none of us would meet her in the House of Mystery, the House of Mystery...\\" And that's it.<br /><br />The DVD is 64 minutes long and was produced and directed by Murray Lerner, who made his name filming the Newport Folk Festival form 1963-1965, and the three days of the Isle of Wight (with iconic full-length concerts from The Who and Jimi Hendrix).<br /><br />If you want to get the concert in its chronological sequence, you really need to listen to the CD, because the DVD shatters it and scatters it all around (which makes it even the more interesting to get the two packaged side-by-side). The DVD starts off with a snippet of \\"Diamonds In The Mine\\", the concert's most engaging (and engaged) piece, before moving into grandiose factoids of the concert, presented in a slideshow format, as well as some interviews with kids at the shot: \\"It's like going to Bethlehem, where they go to see the baby Jesus, [but] we go to see Leonard Cohen\\" (and somebody blurts in \\"Pink Floyd\\"). But, of course, you always wonder about duplicity from the filmmakers, especially with their memories addled by nearly 40 years of living - they say that he sang \\"It's four in the morning, the end of September\\" at four in the morning at the end of August, but was it four in the morning?  Were the audience shots of hippies captured in rapture even filmed during Leonard Cohen's spot, or were they blissing out to Hendrix?  I guess we'll never know.<br /><br />The DVD has several interesting interviews. One of them is with Bob Johnston, a Southerner who ended up producing three Leonard Cohen albums (although only one at the time of the concert - \\"Songs From A Room\\", Cohen's second release; he also produced the third and the fourth, \\"Songs Of Love And Hate\\" of 1972 and \\"Live Songs\\", from 1973), but who also produced six Bob Dylan releases and seven Johnny Cash releases, all from the 1965-1971 - busy guy. He talks about how he was shanghaied into being a keyboardist for the release, but also how the show went down, giving the quote \\"I think Leonard Cohen is the best performer in the world, he bought poetry into music\\" (hey - is that a dig at Bob Dylan?). Kris Kristofferson, who battled the militant and unforgiving audience at the show, talks about how Cohen commanded the stage throughout, and there are a few scenes to prove it of Kris' nervous performance - gosh, he looked young without a beard in 1970. Joan Baez talks about the era, and Judy Collins gushes about Leonard and \\"Suzanne\\", a song that she sorta made famous, spouting \\"God bless Leonard Cohen and his muse.\\" This bit, and to some extent Baez's bit, are shoved into the edit, as they really don't have a lot to add to the concert itself.<br /><br />For the most part, the concert footage is on Leonard Cohen's face, with the occasional wander to the angelic backup singers (the only three people besides Cohen, incidentally, who  stand throughout the show), with brief sections where you see the band and the whole stage (they look really bored while Cohen does \\"The Stranger Song\\" totally solo... some Army) - and a few shots where you see the band from behind, with the amps marked WHO displayed prominently. While it's not interesting to constantly watch Cohen's face as he sings his songs, it is interesting to see and hear him do the hand whistle of \\"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\", which I've heard a billion times but never knew it was done by Cohen himself just blowing through his hand.<br /><br />Happily, \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" is shown in its entirety, including the part where Charlie Daniels stands up and plays the fiddle next to him, as is the \\"They've surrounded the island; one of these days we're going to have this land for our own,\\" to which there is tremendous (canned?) applause. But this how it appears on the album, so... Appearing in its entirety is also the illustrious \\"Sing Another Song Boys\\", which showed up in its entirety on his next studio album \\"Songs Of Love And Hate\\", although the wigged out \\"Diamonds In The Mine\\" is not on the DVD for some reason (except for a brief excerpt of the beginning bit at the start of the DVD).<br /><br />Cohen dedicates \\"The Partisan\\" to Joan Baez, and here we get a chance to see images from her press conference at the time, a bit of her live show, a snapshot of Jimi Hendrix's set as viewed from the audience (to avoid copyright hassles?), and ultimately the 2009 interview with the lady herself.<br /><br />Just a bit of deception - the last song in the movie is \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy,\\" and it is presented as if it were an encore; listening to the CD, though, I'm not sure it was.e bathroom and blew her head off with her brother's shotgun.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|I didn't bother watching this show the first 2 years it was on TV. I figured why would I watch a show about a bunch of motorcycle driving punks who just like to drink beer and create a bunch of meaningless violence. My son who is over 21 told me I had to watch it. He said it was awesome.What an understatement. I watch alot of TV and have seen alot of different shows.This is one of the top 5 ever.I kid you not when I say it is better then The Sopranos. Great writing, great acting Katey Sagal as Gemma is fantastic she should get all the awards out there for best actress.Their is alot more to this show then just drugs and violence. Do yourself a favor and sit down and enjoy this show.
B00005JNTX|3.0|How many times can a guy get shot and not be killed?  Entertainment value in this movie depends on how many times you can enjoy the same guy being killed over and over again.  Variety involves method of execution.    Atmospheric sets, and cinematic style are not enough to make a good movie. So what does that leave?  Ah yes, gorey special effects. It didn't offend, it just bored - like watching someone else play a video game.  The Mickey Rourke sequence was probably the best of the bunch, but even then, this movie's a time waster.  The difference between this pulp fiction and Tarantino's masterpiece (back when he still had an ounce of creativity) is that the movie \\"Pulp Fiction\\" had memorable characters and character development, interesting situations and dialogue, humour to round off the violence (and when the violence hit, it was scary!) and an intriguing and clever story all the way through.  A difference in 'pulp fiction' I guess.  You can add this one to your zombie movie collection.

0385341008|5.0|From the first page to the last, I was so wrapped up in the story that I could barely do the rudimentary chores I needed to do.  I didn't want to put it down, and actually I didn't for very long.  The story is gripping, sad, funny (laugh-out-loud funny in places), tender, and the sort that makes you wish you knew your geography and history better.  One suggestion:  Have a pen and paper with you so that you can sort out who's who.  There are many letters from many people and it is a bit easier to keep track if you keep a list.  I intend to have our book club discuss this book as soon as we finish the current one.  It is easily one of the top 10 books in my list of favorites.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Terrific movie/mini series.  HBO did a great job with it.  The acting was great, the characters were well developed and the art design was beautiful.  A+++
B0015DWJX2|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that I absolutely love. I'm also not one to read a book more than once as there are too many books to read in the world and not enough time. This is a book that I will read again and again. When I finished the book I wanted... to start over from the beginning and that's something that rarely happens to me. Just loved the humor in the book. I'm still thinking of the charachters long after I've finished reading. Wish I could live on Guernsey amongst these people. P.S. This is the first book review I've ever written. That's how much the book moved me.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My daughter asked for this for Christmas.  It arrived several days before Christmas, in perfect condition.  David Attenborough always does an excellent job with his documentaries.  This is no exception.
B000OVLBIU|3.0|Ghost Rider could have been better,alot better,darker considering it's Ghost Rider. Eva Mendes is beautiful, But Nicolas Cage?(he's cool, he has alot of cool cars,Corvettes in his movies) but come on? Typical Hollywood Adaption of A Comic book,not true to story.and Peter I am a commie fonda?Some Bad CGI AND fights. But I didn't hate the movie. 3 to 3 1/2 stars for the movie.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Just to set things straight, I LOVE the movie and soundtrack! Best movie in the world. The CD is no exception. However, when I put it on my iPod nano 5th gen, it comes up as \\"Unkown artist\\" and the tracks are labeled as \\"Track 01, Track 02\\" etc. So absaloutly buy the CD! It's fantastic! Just if you care about seeing the tracks download it from iTunes or something.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I was very skeptical of an AIC album without Layne... my skepticism was quickly answered.    This album is the definition of grunge metal. It's like TRUE ROCK has been reborn after a decade plus to kick all these teeny bopper emo bands right in the teeth.     I am completely blown away by how much this cd ROCKS.  Cannot say enough good things about this cd, best music I've heard in many many years, one of the best cd's I've ever listened to.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I love this movie! The cinematography, the acting, the storyline, it's just unbelievable. If you have not seen this movie, you need to do so ASAP!
B002RSDW8A|4.0|this was a great funny yet learning experince with my wife. i thought i'ed be bored.
1597772992|5.0|My husband has genetic heart disease and for five years I have been looking for information to help him and to encourage a healthy diet and lifestyle but he has been apathetic about change until listening to The China Study. Dr. Campbell builds a compelling case concerning health issues related to eating animal protein (that is simple and easy to understand) - so much so that I gave copies to those I love for gifts. Now, my husband, myself, some family members and a few friends have adopted a plant based diet. A diet that I (we) thought would be boring and impossible. But Dr. Campbell's teaching has motivated us and we get together for support and to exchange delicious recipes.     The China Study has truly been life transforming on so many levels and for this I am grateful!!! Thank you Dr. Campbell!!!
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son, who is a huge \\"Godfather\\" fan.  He was overjoyed, to say the least.  Highly recommend it to other fans.
0061537969|5.0|Having a close bond with my dog, I knew that I would enjoy Mr. Stein's work.  This book is so well written that at times you forget that you are only reading.  The dog as narrator allows you to see the characters from a unique perspective.  This book is not just a pet story, but a human story as well.
1416914307|5.0|The Mortal Cup and the Soul Sword are gone. Valentine has disappeared once again, taking his army of ravening demons with him. For now. The dust seems to have settled in New York City. But that doesn't mean Clary's life is back to normal. Not by a long shot.<br /><br />Her mother is still hospitalized with a mysterious coma. She is still painfully in love with Jace. Who is still her brother--and determined to be only her brother. He is also determined to do everything in his power to keep Clary away from Idris' City of Glass--the jewel of the Shadowhunter home country and the place where Clary might finally find the key to finally waking her mother.<br /><br />But after coming so far and getting so close to saving her mother, Clary isn't about to take no for an answer.<br /><br />It turns out entering Idris illegally is going to be the least of Clary's problems. Her best friend Simon, a vampire who can now withstand daylight, has been thrown in prison. Jace still refuses to help Clary save their mother while another mysterious Shadowhunter named Sebastian seems strangely eager to offer his assistance.<br /><br />Meanwhile Valentine is still searching for the last Mortal Instrument--known to be somewhere in Idris. With a demon army at his fingertips, it's only a matter of time before he finds it and declares war on all Shadowhunters.<br /><br />The Shadowhunters are fierce warriors but few in number. Aligning themselves with their Downworlder enemies could turn the tide of war in their favor if both sides can see past age-old differences in time. No matter what happens next, one thing is clear: Everything is about to change in City of Glass (2009) by Cassandra Clare.<br /><br />The stunning conclusion to Clare's Mortal Instruments trilogy (a fourth book is due out in 2011 and a companion trilogy starts in 2010) is packed with the action readers will have come to expect from the series. Demons are fought, battles are waged, and everything question is finally answered.<br /><br />While readers might recognize some common fantasy themes, the story itself remains fresh--filled with twists that are both shocking and, unfortunately, sometimes heartbreaking. Clare's writing is drum-tight throughout the story from the initial set-up to its satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: The Demon's Lexicon by Sarah Rees Brennan, War for the Oaks by Emma Bull, Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, Jellicoe Road by Melina Marchetta, Paradise Lost by John Milton, Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare, The Last of the High Kings by Kate Thompson,  The Bible<br /><br />While readers might recognize some common fantasy themes, the story itself remains fresh--filled with twists that are both shocking and, unfortunately, sometimes heartbreaking.

0143038419|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book (although the section in India was my least favorite of the three sections); however, I am a divorced person, who could very much relate to the pain and the struggle to re-discover yourself that is the core of this story. For those who can't relate, I understand that the book didn't appeal to them, but I believe the anger and disgust found in some of these negative reviews show a lack of compassion.       I think this book speaks to people who have felt their world turned completely upside down after a divorce or horrible break-up - no it isn't cancer, and she doesn't go out trying to cure cancer, but if you've been in a place where you thought you knew your future, and then discovered that you actually don't know a damn thing, then I believe this book will appeal to you. The author is not Christian (and does not apologize for this) but is in search of her Truth and writes of God with a capital G. I believe this is what disgusts some people about the book - how dare a Non-Christian claim to be searching for Truth?!? If this is you, you most likely will not enjoy this book. She also speaks honestly about the pain and suffering caused by her divorce and the following break-up. If you are a person who has no compassion for getting divorced or the pain caused by divorce, then odds are you may judge the book and the author harshly.      For those who have already read the book, and are here to write a review of their own, you might be interested in learning more about some of the people she writes about in the book:  Here is the website of \\"Richard from Texas\\": [...]  Here is the website for Luca Spaghetti: [...]  And at this website run by fans you can see pictures of David, and get updates on others from the book, like the Indonesian-Christian Yudi who was kicked out of the U.S. after 9-11:  [...]    I have to admit, I also add these links because a few of the hateful negative reviews have gone so far as to accuse the author of making these people up, which clearly is not the case.  No book appeals to everyone, and I can understand why some people find this story somewhat 'self absorbed' (even though it admits to being about self-discovery) but if you've ever been a little self-absorbed yourself, after the pain of something like a divorce has completely turned your world upside down, then I would recommend this book to you.
1878424777|5.0|The following is a copy of the review I left for the book with additional comments about the audio cd.    OK, so I've had various self-help books recommended to me in the past which never seemed to sink in.  They all seemed to be carbon copied 'feel-good' books.  That's not to say they were without value, just not for me. I'd come to the point where I was really in need of a book that would help give me a better outlook on life and help me develop a more positive image of myself.    While I'd never heard of the Toltec I was familiar with the Teotihuacan people as I had lived in Mexico City for a year and visited the pyrimids of the Sun and the Moon several times.  I couldn't believe the impact this book had on me. . .  so simple, so straight forward, so enlightening, SO COMMENSENSE!!!  And not a book that has a temporary impact then gradually subsides.  It stays with you and if any of you are like me you read it over and over and over again.    I also went back and ordered the audio cd and Peter Coyote was the absolute best choice for this book.  He does a phanomanol job, knowing where to pause, where to put emphasis. BRILLIANT is the best word for it.    I asked the person who recommended this book to me why I had such an intense desire to give a copy to everyone I knew and cared about.  The answer is so simple . . . Because you love them and you want to share this 'Pathway to Personal Freedom' with everyone.  And that's exactly what I did, bought copies for all those I loved.    Don't miss out!!!
B00000K413|5.0|My husband had this on his Christmas list and is very happy with the CD.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Nothing can portray the full of extent of suffering that Jesus underwent for the world, but this movie is probably the best that man can do in trying to bring about a semblence of His unbearable suffering.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|The Big Bang is a great new show and always makes me laugh out loud!
0316044938|2.0|Let me start by saying that I REALLY wanted to like this book.  And honestly, I did enjoy the first half.  But somewhere around halfway through, the action simply stopped.  It was as if the book ended, and the rest was just wasted, depressing words.  I found myself skimming the words and checking the percentage read on my Kindle because I was ready to be done with this book.  But, despite that, I might have given this book a 3-star rating for effort until something at the end slapped me in the face.     Susie has just seen her killer slowly driving by her old house, checking her sister out in the upstairs window.  Then she is at the sinkhole where her bones are located, and her murderer is driving by.  So when granted a little while back in a human body right at that moment, what would you imagine she did?  Run to warn her sister?  Tell her friends where her bones are located?  Go tell her dad she is ok and he can move on?  Nope - she came back for a booty call.  She used another girl's body (rape if you ask me) to have sex with the boy she kissed before she died.  Keep in mind that this is still a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL (her age at her death) and that she was BRUTALLY RAPED AND MURDERED.  I am appalled that she came back for nothing more than sex with some boy.  Never before have I wanted to call up an author and scream, \\"Why?!\\"  It's insanity, and it completely ruined the book.    Ok, I've worked myself into a tizzy, so I am going to say that I hope the movie is better.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We watch this every year at Christmas time. Dad got a blue ray for his birthday, so we knew this would be a perfect gift for him.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The Hughes Brothers have made an outstanding film in the post-apocalyptic genre. This is a wonderfully crafted story and Denzel Washington is at his best here. Surprise cast members include Jennifer Beals and Tom Waits. The production quality, set design, make-up, special effects, stunts, everything about this movie is great. If you're a fan of The Omega Man, I Am Legend, and The Road, you'll love this film.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My family LOVES this game. (Two adults, a first grader and a third grader). We play a lot of board games (monopoly, risk, clue, scrabble, etc) and this one has eclipsed them all.    The instructions are intimidating at first, but it's a lot simpler than it looks initially. Very fun, very versatile. The only two drawbacks are:    1) The board is hard to set up & keep together. The pieces fit together like a puzzle, bu it has a tendency to move around a bit during gameplay. It's a mild annoyance and not really a big deal, though.    2) You will lose a lot of time. We played it after dinner last night and wound up quitting when we realized it was after 10PM. Good thing school was out the next day...
B0014H32MG|5.0|I was expecting a story similar to the movie staring the governer of california, and it was not! This is very different. It's much better! It is a excellent read, fast paced and detailed with well developed charectars. The low price makes it a must for your Kindle.
B00004YRQA|5.0|The memory card that I received works great and I am totally satisfied with this purchase.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is amazing, and this album is worth every cent!!  He is today's Jack Johnson, you'll be singing these songs at the beach forever.
B0000CE0JH|5.0|I was in 12th grade (2004) when I bought this CD.<br />I hadn't heard any of his music until I heard his version of \\"Hallelujah.\\" I decided to figure out what this man was about; so I bought this CD. It was my first Rufus Wainwright CD, and I listened to it over and over. Each time I played it I found more that I liked. This was the album that made me a fan. Since this CD, I've bought his entire collection of albums he's put out.<br />I think you should buy it.<br />If you don't like it, at least you tried it.<br />I do recommend listening to it a few times through before you decide. I was hooked the 3rd time through.
B00000AF95|5.0|one of the best albums that has gone uncredited. Guitar,drums, and vocals all combine. even tho they were going through a hard time with Gene's hollywood career. you can tell the writers took time to sit and think. without Desmond child kiss would be nothing.
B002KREVE2|5.0|I bought this for my mister for his Christmas gift. I really didn't know a whole lot about Leonard Cohen except for a few songs that I've heard. I really like him, but haven't seen him perform. I knew that my mister wanted this so I bought it from Amazon and we recieved it in the mail on Christmas Eve.<br /><br />We watched it that night and it was such a beautiful DvD. I think I may have cried a few times. Leonard is so genuine and such a talented man.<br />I think every Leonard fan needs to own this. Since Christmas, I think we've put the DvD on about once a week, even if it is just background noise. We love it!<br />I think you need to add this to your Cohen collection!
0446402389|1.0|The story matches its far fetched, incoherent plot with plodding writing and quickly wears out the reader's patience.  No accounting for the gushing blurbs on the book's cover. Save yourself the trouble of slogging through this laughable piece of \\"writing\\".
044654146X|5.0|Dan Senor and Saul Singer's Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle is well researched and a fascinating read. The book is divided into four main parts:<br /><br />  * The Little Nation That Could<br />  * Seeding a Culture of Innovation<br />  * Beginnings<br />  * Country with a Motive<br /><br />In The Little Nation That Could we learn PayPal's Scott Thompson's first impressions of a young Shvat Shaked, whose young company, Fraud Sciences, developed the most up-to-date solution to the problem of online payment scams, credit card fraud, and electronic identity theft. As we read about Fraud Sciences, its founders Shvat Shaked and Saar Wilf, their approach to problem solving and the impressions of the top executives of PayPal, Ebay and Benchmark Capital, it becomes clear that the story of technological innovations and start-up ventures in Israel is deep and unique.<br /><br />I was struck by story after story that traced technological and scientific innovations to Israeli dedication, chutzpah, a culture of debate/argument and the lack of a hierarchy. One of the earliest investors in Israel was Intel, and the company credits its Israeli team with the \\"right turn\\" in thinking that led to innovations in Intel's microprocessor and the development of its Core 2 Duo chips.<br /><br />In Seeding A Culture of Innovation Senor and Singer suggest that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and its elite branches have helped to develop leadership, skills, and social networks: \\"While it's difficult to get into the top Israeli universities, the nation's equivalent of Yale, Harvard, and Princeton are the IDF's elite units. The unit in which an applicant served tells prospective employers what kind of selection process he or she navigated, what skills and relevant experience he or she may already possess.\\" Senor and Singer describe the elite and intensive Talpiot program - its development, what it entails, its strengths, and the accomplishments of its graduates. The relative openness, importance placed on devolving authority and giving greater responsibility to lower ranks has played a significant role in developing effective and confident leaders; this has benefited Israel as a nation and as a leader in technology.<br /><br />I found Seeding A Culture of Innovation fascinating. The comparisons that Senor and Singer make between the nation states of Israel and Singapore and the IDF and the US military were particularly insightful.<br /><br />Beginnings covers the history of Israel's economy and the effects of government policies. The chapter is full of inspiring and impressive successes. There are examples of \\"the Israeli's penchant for taking problems-like the lack of water-and turning them into assets the fields of desert agriculture, drip irrigation, and desalination.\\" Senor and Singer write about (1) Simcha Blass and his development of drip irrigation and the creation of Netafim, the global drip irrigation company and (2) about Kibbutz Mashabbe Sade in the Negev Desert where a salt water well was used for farming warm water fish like tilapia and sea bass.<br /><br />In Beginnings Senor and Singer also discuss how factors like the waves of immigration, particularly skilled immigrants from the former USSR, have contributed to Israel's continued growth and development. Similarly the Jewish diaspora and \\"brain circulation\\" have played significant roles in enabling Israel and its industries to develop and flourish. While countries like my homeland suffer from the \\"brain drain,\\" Senor and Singer describe brain circulation as \\"the phenomenon when talented people leave, settle down abroad, and then return to their home country and yet are not fully 'lost\\" to either place.\\" Through example after example, Senor and Singer demonstrate how Israel has benefited from a deep diaspora network.<br /><br />The stories in Start-Up Nation demonstrate a determination, tenacity and dedication that is impressive and inspiring. In the chapter The Buffett Effect, Senor and Singer share how investors like Warren Buffett have chosen to invest in Israel regardless of the violence in Israel and the many risks. Senor and Singer suggest that Warren Buffett does not discount the catastrophic risk in Israel but that Buffett does not consider the factory or the R&D facilities to be the value of his company's investment in Israel. Instead, Senor and Singer write that when Buffett bought into the company Iscar, Buffett considered the talent of the employees and management, the international base of customers and the brand to be Iscar's value. Even with the factories destroyed, Iscar, Warren Buffett's investment, would not suffer catastrophic risk.<br /><br />The final section of Start-Up Nation, Country with a Motive, describes the start of Israel's defense industry, how in the medical devices and biotech sectors companies have been successful creating innovative \\"mashups\\" and \\"economic clusters.\\" The concept of a cluster was developed by Michael Porter and is understood to mean \\"a unique model for economic development because it's based on 'geographic concentrations' of interconnected institutions - businesses, governmental agencies, universities-in a specific field.\\" We're familiar with these economic clusters: the financial cluster in Wall Street and the biotech cluster in Boston. Citing Michael Porter, Senor and Singer emphasize the benefit that comes from \\"the intense concentration of people working in and talking about the same industry provides companies with better access to employees, suppliers, and specialized information. A cluster does not exist only in the workplace; it is a part of the fabric of daily life, involving interaction among peers at the local coffee shop, when picking kids up from school, and at church. Community connections become industry connections and vice versa.\\" Israel has been successful in creating technology, biotech and medical device clusters. The development of these clusters is in sharp contrast with the absence of similar organic or self-sustaining clusters in Dubai despite the massive investments in money and talent of Dubai, Inc.<br /><br />In Start-Up Nation, Dan Senor and Saul Singer give us a well researched and fascinating insight into Israel's economic miracle.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|I have been on a bit of a military science fiction kick lately and this was a book that was highly recommended by those \\"in the know\\" about such matters.  After reading it I would have to say that I agree one hundred percent with the critics.  This is one of the best military science fiction books I have ever read.      John Perry is a 75 year old earth dweller who's wife has passed on some eight years earlier.  He has decided to give up everything he had ever known in order to join the Colonial Defense Forces in return for the vague promise of some type of youth treatment.  Perry is not prepared for what he will face during his time as a CDF trooper, or what he will become.    This book was very well written and engaging.  The characters were generally humorous and nicely developed.  the plot is a bit thin in that it consists mostly of a series of \\"vignettes\\" or scenes rather than a fully developed plot in the first half of the book.  In the second half the plot develops nicely, with some nice twists, and really saves the work as a whole.      I would consider this a somewhat flawed but very, very enjoyable novel.  It is astounding that this is the debut novel from Mr Scalzi, I would expect great things from him in his later books.  I have already ordered \\"The Ghost Brigades\\" from Amazon and I look forward to watching Mr Scalzi develop as his first novel was so artfully constructed.  Highly Recommended.
B001DWNUCO|1.0|I always though the \\"Haters\\" hated the movie because of it's subject matter or the constant soft core nudity... but imagine a soft porn movie made on an old 60's \\"Lost in Space\\" TV show set with a whole bunch of people who clearly don't want to be there and you've pretty much got it. How you can ruin a movie with such an interesting historical charactor, name actors and a ton of Penthouse Pets is beyond me. It wasn't even mildly erotic.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Im sure you've seen the movie at this point.  This movie is the reason you bought a blu ray player.  If you have blu ray and a home theatre this is a must own.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|Can we go ahead and not interject our very narrow modern political opinions into a historical tale about another government and country, rockygreen?  thank you.    This is a great movie about another place in time, concerning a government that was not run by officials who were elected regularly by the people of the country.  These citizens had no say in the political process, and could not change things if they didn't like them.  And there were no human rights, because the people weren't in charge; they couldn't be electing and re-electing when the leaders didn't suit them.  The citizens of this time could not popularly elect, by their own will, a candidate whose main political platform was to fix the insurance fiasco in a democratic country. :)
B000NIVJGI|1.0|First, the movie, the story, the characters are all wonderful, they get 5 stars.  This Blu-ray, it gets a 1 star (I wish I could give it less).  A common issue with early blu-ray discs are lack of qualtiy.  The color, graininess and \\"WIDESCREEN\\" on this Blu-ray are all a joke.  Talking to the people who did the work on this Blu-ray; if you're going to transfer garbage then all you're going to get is 1080p, hi-def garbage!  Whoever did the work on this Blu-ray release does not know what they are doing and most likely did not care.  The skin tones go from just OK to bright pink and even orange (we're talking skin tones that would make an Oompa-loompa jealous).  The transfer is also dark, lacking all the great details that the movie is known for, leaving those of us who watch this film with a less than full (forget about \\"BEYOUND HIGH DEFINITION\\") experience.  The graininess on every version of this film is bad and this Blu-Ray is no exception, it is very distracting.  Then, finally, the \\"WIDESCREEN\\" part of my review, the back of the Blu-ray tells us that it is 16x9 or 1.85.1 - DUH!  The thing is Blu-ray, of course it is widescreen!  Not to mention that they stretched the whole thing, the people look like they've all been on a mid-evil torture device.    My advice is to stick with the \\"Ultimate\\" version of the movie on DVD and watch it though your Blu-ray player's up-converter feature.  You will end up with a much more enjoyable experience
B002LW9ITY|3.0|Of course the movie is wonderful.  The Blu-Ray is outstanding and it comes with a DVD version.<br /><br />I bought the gift set because it was an inexpensive way to get the Blu-Ray (it was priced well below the Blu-Ray price during a Christmas sale).  The toy cars are of a sub-standard quality and not worth paying extra.  I would not recommend buying this unless it was less expensive than just the Blu-Ray disc.
B002U6CJO2|5.0|After watching the new remastered 2.0 version and have seen the original Ghost in the shell movie the only complaint is some of the CGI scenes being replaced by some of the anime.The video compared to the 2 disc remastered release has been very notiably cleaned up.The director also brought back the cast from the original movie to do the voice recordings and compared to the original sounds alot better also.The original actors are older now so the voice over being redone gave this remastering a more mature sound to the movie and if your a fan appreciate that the director used the same actors again to do the voice overs again.The sound has also been redone.If you have a nice Hi-Def TV and surround sound this movie sounds and looks excellent!!The director also remastered the original musical score with a higher sounding tone that sounds alot better than the original score.I had the original Manga release from sometime ago and picked up the 2 disc original rerelease of the movie when it came out on dvd.I still like the original presentation without the CGI but, being treated to a fully remastered version of the film was a visual and audio treat.What I did not like about the release of the Ghost in the shell 2.0 is this is a bare release with no special features at all and should have been released onto dvd much better by the publisher.If you have never seen this movie at all I recommend watch the original version of the film without the CGI then watch this version to fully appreciate the movie.What I hope what will happen and since Dreamworks got the ok to do a live action 3D version of Ghost in the shell is maybe the original version of the anime without the CGI can be remastered and a Box set release along with the live action release of the film can be done with both movies and special features included in the set would give this movie a well deserved release.Hopefully the end release of this movie will be the same way Blade Runner was done countless times on DVD.Fornow if you don't own either version of the movie get both of them watch the original first then the 2.0 remaster.This is a very well done movie ahead of its time!!!

B002RHL8DC|1.0|This review is in regard to the series as a whole, not this particular episode.    I want to like it, I really do. My wife and I have been huge fans of the Stargate franchise since the 1st episode of SG1, and through the latter, lamer days of Atlantis.    I normally would post a long, informative review with a sufficient amount information to help others get a good idea of what the high and low points of the show are. However, all things being relative (to the previous Stargate series), I liken this show to a public restroom. If trying to explain to a person the less desirable points of a public restroom, and given that the listener has visited one on even a single occasion, one does not need to supply an abundance of supporting evidence as to why others should steer clear, nor does the \\"character or nature\\" of the public restroom warrant such attention or justification. But still, a couple of short observations    I'm not saying that the show has NO good points at all, but relative to other Sci-fi programs, it really doesn't. A couple of short observations for those still considering wasting that $1.99.    1. A dark, sappy, self indulging soap opera containing constant social cliches and political commentaries, that merely takes place on a space ship, is not science-fiction.  2. The act of casting a show with almost entirely unlikeable characters, numerous plot-holes, and entire episodes that are dedicated to occupying time while the writers devise ways to further the plot in subsequent episodes, is not redeemed by the fact that it takes place on a space ship.  3. A cast of morally ambiguous characters, having sex constantly with everything but the ZPM, on a space ship, is not science fiction. It's certainly not Stargate.    The show is a cross between Desperate Housewives and Battlestar Galactica, minus the sci-fi and action elements of Battlestar Galactica, and with the drawn out lack of plot development found in the middle seasons of Lost. The sheer volume of sex, drama, whiney/conflicted/angry characters and plot holes, coupled with the lazy writing and reliance on cheap gags like lesbian love scenes, and the token angry black man is mentally exhausting.    If you want drama, sex, social commentary or sci-fi lite, there are other series that accomplish that task without claiming to be something they are not. Let's not forget that this is a SciFi (SyFy) channel series.

B002ZG997M|3.0|The world following the apocalypse has become a nearly barren desert, populated by loosely knit groups of humans who cling to survival with dirty talons, and make little effort to cling to civilization.  Many drive modified motorcycles.  Into this desolation wanders a lonely figure, reluctantly on a journey that urges him to disassociate from humanity in favor of headlong movement across the landscape.  He is also a ferocious fighter when he needs to be, and under the hard exterior is capable of feeling a need for companionship and meaning.    Nope, I'm not describing THE ROAD WARRIOR.  I'm not talking about THE ROAD.  I'm talking about the very unoriginal THE BOOK OF ELI, starring Denzel Washington as the mysterious man Eli who is compelled to walk ever Westward across a landscape wrecked by nuclear war...where there are few survivors and many of them have turned to cannibalism.  He carries a book with him that is unique in what is left of mankind, and he believes that he must deliver this into the right hands.    On his path, he is frequently beset by violence...but fortunately, he has almost superhuman hand-to-hand fighting skills (and a very sharp sword), so that he can easily defeat 6 or more hardened, experienced fighting men in about 20 seconds flat.    He wanders into a town, where the self-appointed mayor (Gary Oldman) happens to be looking for the very book that Eli happens to be carrying.  Eli escapes, but is accompanied (much to his chagrin) by a spunk young lady (Mila Kunis) who is drawn to Washington's gentleness and probably by a chance to \\"see the world.\\"  The two must fight off efforts to bring them back to this town, save the book and deliver it to the location Eli feels God has told him to bring it.    ELI is filmed in a washed out, sepia-toned manner, and is virtually devoid of any other color.  There are lots of shots of Eli moving across the barren land, and plenty of moments where he just stands in place and looks cool.  Denzel Washington hascharisma to burn, and it is this charisma that makes the film watchable.  We immediately take to this quiet, mysterious man...because we immediately are drawn to Washington.  Washington talks very little, and except for two or three short bursts of action...seems to DO very little.  Yet he's fairly riveting, and that's due simply to his presence.  He doesn't so much give a performance as he gives a persona.      Were a lesser actor than Washington in this film, it would just be a slow-moving, sepia colored, B-level post-apocalyptic chore of a movie.  There's very little that's honestly original, and surprisingly little actual action.  I expected more fighting, but got very little when it was all said and done.  Gary Oldman, who has been such a great villain over the years, really never makes much of a foreboding presence.  We get that he's a bit crazy and a lot dangerous, but it feels vague and unspecific.  Surprisingly, Jennifer Beals makes a nice impression as Oldman's \\"girlfriend\\" and Mila Kunis' mother.  Kunis is working up an interesting film resume, having been credible now in things as diverse as ELI & FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.  I'm not ready to put her on the A-list yet, but I also never thought the kid who played Jackie on THAT `70s SHOW would have a viable film career.  She's actually pretty good, and towards the end of the film, has some nice moments with Washington which finally give the film a long overdue shot of human emotion.    In the end, your enjoyment of this movie will depend a lot on how much you like either a) Washington or b) post-apocalyptic films, no matter how derivative of far better films.  While I didn't mind the time I spent watching THE BOOK OF ELI...my time would have been better spent re-watching THE ROAD WARRIOR...the film that after all these years is STILL the gold-standard in this little subgenre.
B00005JM20|4.0|You tell 'em, perla! This is not side-splitting but still a funny movie with toilet humor (literally) and lots of slapstick. It reminds me of the Jacques Clousseau series with Peter Sellers, not high-brow but it could grow on you. John Malkovich is one of the few American actors who can play a great villain. JE's partner and \\"the femme fatale\\" are also worth watching. A sequel wouldn't be unexpected. Hey, Rush Hour 4: Lee and Carter are in London when Lee gets hurt and JE takes his place. Revenge!!
031606792X|1.0|All four books in this series were on the weak side, filled with repetition, unnecessary detail, immature dialogue, sappy romance, and an irritating damsel in distress.  But I was willing to put aside the bad writing and annoying characters for a clever and original story--good vs. bad vampires and shape-shifting werewolves.<br /><br />My patience ended with \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" a pathetic, rambling 750-page finale that could have been condensed to 250-300 pages in adept hands.  I felt abused by Stephenie Meyer, who didn't bother with editing and just vomited word after word on paper to get her paycheck.  After investing so much time in the series, I felt compelled to finish--even though what I really wanted to do was toss this last book in the trash.<br /><br />\\"Breaking Dawn\\" was boring, tedious, and anticlimactic.  I'm done with Stephenie Meyer forever, and, thanks to her, with vampires and romance for the foreseeable future.

Abram's Summer blockbuster of 2009; STAR TREK. This movie has many great special effects, a great plot and a perfect assemble of an all star cast. I saw this movie at school in my homeboy; Mr. Holladay's Animation class and asked this for Christmas. I received it as a present and loved it. This movie is one to watch in order to believe how beautiful it is. I will leave it at that. Infinity out of infinity star rating.

B002QGUFWE|4.0|I've read most of the reviews here for The Fame Monster CD and all the outrage expressed by some over the censorship, i.e., missing filthy words. I don't understand. Well, I do actually. I'm sorry to say that I do, because I think it's a sad commentary on society that people become outraged that filthy words are missing from music and so won't buy an album or CD, even though the music is still just as wonderful. Quite frankly, most of the time when I listen to a song, I can't catch all of the lyrics I'm listening to anyway. Oh, I get most of them, but not every word - that's why nowadays I look them up on the Internet (if I really want to know what they are)...or, years back, I used to buy the albums for the album notes. I know someone will try to tell me that the artist, in this case, Lady Gaga, wrote those filthy words as part of her lyrics, and so to leave them out is a disservice and an outrage to her art - her music. Maybe. But she's allowing these versions to be sold, isn't she? Or did I miss something. I like her music; I'd never really noticed the dirty words.
B002VECMB8|4.0|From the director of \\"Thank you for smoking\\" and \\"Juno\\" comes another film called Up in the air. The film has been shot all over USA but yet what you get to see are yachts and getaway planes. You see airports, hotels, offices and you see people waiting in lines offended about some jerk who just cut them off in the line because he has special privileges. That jerk is played masterfully by George Clooney who's style of acting I'm finally starting to like. Vera Farmiga played a good co-star and the other actors, I don't know their names so I won't bother.<br /><br />In this film, Clooney shines as Ryan Bingham, a 40 something hedonist who is very good at his job and packing his luggage. The editing is sharp and the soundtrack was good.  I won't bother explaining his job but I can tell you one thing, this is one of those few films which are a little better than what the trailer offers. I don't think we can call this is an indie film because the subject matter is unique. I wondered how the film would end halfway through it. The dialogues are very entertaining and humorous without being fashionably dark.<br /><br />The only thing that surprised me was how I was the only person in the house-full AMC audi who clapped much to everyone's smiling displeasure. Do not miss this film, watch it on the big screen before they take it off. Some very good acting, good characters, good music and heavy handed end. This film has it all. It's not quite the \\"Catch me if you can\\" because it is not remotely about crime but still the subject matter is not only engaging but relevant and current. I'll put a full stop to my review now. Must watch.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|This review is for people considering buying the DVD to view this movie for the _first_ time--an audience I expect to be quite different from those who saw it as a summer blockbuster in the theaters.<br /><br />At its core, this is a reunion movie, a genre characterized by squeezing together a stream of tributes to the characters and evocative scenes from a franchise.  If this is what you are looking for, there is more than enough to be very satisfying.<br /><br />However, if you are expecting more, remember that, unlike a sequel/prequel, a reunion movie doesn't attempt to extend the franchise, but simply tries to milk what it sees as a dead one. Consequently, the plot is typically forced to be minimal and/or preposterous by the requirement to stitch together all those tributes.  This movie's dubious innovation is to create the category of \\"preunion\\" movie.<br /><br />Compounding the inherent problems of the reunion format, much of what doesn't come from TOS (The Original Series) is \\"borrowed\\" from elsewhere, and the choices are not particularly good.  For example, the scene where Kirk and Scottie transport into the engine room plays like a magic-gone-awry humorous interlude from a Harry Potter movie.  For example, the Romulan ship seems strangely familiar--misappropriated from another SciFi series/movie of many years ago?  Whatever, the ship's visuals are contrary to the story line.<br /><br />There is nothing of the spirit of TOS in this movie.  I would not be surprised to learn that director Abrams hadn't seen anything more than a few brief clips and stills from TOS.  The strength and appeal of TOS was that it was science fiction, in contrast to generic action/adventure transplanted into outer space.  This movie rejects those origins: There is no science fiction here. Reportedly, director Abrams dislikes science fiction. His exception for the Star Wars series is consistent because those movies were predominantly high-end sword-and-sorcery epics/adventures, rendered in a high-tech future.<br /><br />Abram's utter failure to appreciate (be aware of?) TOS and science fiction is most vividly seen in his use of Romulans as generic villains--Romulans were a dramatic vehicle for exploring, via compare-and-contrast to the Vulcans, the potentially large consequences of small changes/choices.<br /><br />The movie suffers badly from the conflict between the genre and the director's goals.  To be successful, a reunion movie should heavily leverage the audience's knowledge of the series, but Abrams' dislike of, and uninterest in, TOS sacrifices that.  What he leaves himself is the clutter of a laundry list of references to TOS, and this overwhelms his stated goal of \\"re-imagining\\".  I didn't notice anything another director might want to build upon.<br /><br />Even divorced from its TOS origins, this movie fails as an action movie .  The plot is light-years beyond willing-suspension-of-disbelief in _all_ of its key attributes. As so many have noted, the villain's course of action is utter nonsense.  Another example, \\"red matter\\" creates a black hole only if placed in certain locations, for example a planet's core but not on its surface or in a syringe, and that black hole quickly consumes the planet but then suddenly stops growing.<br /><br />The characters are poorly formulated, but none so much as Kirk.  I watched TOS as a teen and for me that Kirk (Shatner's) as a captain/leader was at the edge of literary-license and suspension-of-disbelief.  No allowances were big enough to accept this Kirk.  He is a brat: arrogant, impulsive, self-involved and self-indulgent.  He might be someone you would find briefly charming in an informal social setting, but not someone you would risk treating as a friend.  Not only is he someone you wouldn't choose as a leader, he is someone you should reject as a follower.<br /><br />The set design for the Enterprise is eye-candy, but largely irrelevant: It is seen in passing but has no part in the story.  There is no \\"Wow, I wish I had one of those!\\"  The action sequences are well executed _technically_, but they are \\"been there, seen that\\".  The action is curiously devoid of emotion and uninvolving, probably because I couldn't buy into the circumstances surrounding it.  Surprisingly, the opening sequence which is battle scene that should have been pulse-pounding and adrenalin-drenched starts out a prosaic, predictable \\"yet-another...\\" but then is interrupted by a protracted, artificial, maudlin element (weepy orchestral background music).  Instead of testosterone, you get estrogen.<br /><br />You need to put yourself in a special mindset for this movie not to be one long sequence of \\"Seen that\\" and \\"What BS!\\" (or \\"most illogical\\" if a Trekkie).ell executed _technically_, but they are \\"been there, seen that\\".

0634049011|5.0|Sorry my Portuenglish.   I recommend this product. It's fantastic if you are'nt a full time guitar student, but likes this instrument end decided to play it until the end (and I'm talking about the the real end).   The five paterns and the lessons are fantastic. If you follow it you will memorize the fretboard and also learn to find the notes if you forgot something.   But, if you buy it, go step by step and moves to a new lesson just when you have the previous fresh on memory. It must occur also when the book says to keep some practices in parallel. Do it step by step.  I also recommend buying some little round adesives (sticks) to fix on the fretboard (7th fret, 3rd string, D=red). It helped me a lot.

Those bands were Blood Sweat & Tears, Ides of March and Chicago (aka Chicago Transit Authority).<br />So much material put together, some of it improv, the debut disc from Chicago is a must have in anyone's audio library. So far (I have CTA, Chicago, IX, XI, 16, 17 and Stone of Sisyphus) I can attest that the Rhino remasters do not disappoint. The sound quality is magnificent with little to no audio or listening fatigue. Yes, it is louder than the original, but the mastering is very good in taking full advantage of the CD format's dynamic range.<br />4.5 stars if I could give it that simply because 1)nothing is perfect and 2) you get a lot of music for a one disc recording.<br />FYI - Chicago's next two albums were also double LPs.. also worth getting.

B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles' 1966 album 'Revolver' is revolutionary. It's groundbreaking. It's a record that we've never seen anything like before or since. Any positive adjective can describe 'Revolver.' It's otherworldly. But enough of me playing the \\"Adjective Game,\\" let's get onto the review.    Take yourself back to 1966. The Beatles have just recently released 'Rubber Soul' (the previous year, 1965) and critics are hailing it as their best, most mature record yet. Also released that year was 'Help!,' a soundtrack to the movie which also showed (in my honest opinion, anyway) how much the Fab Four matured in a year.     But by the time '66 rolled around, the Beatles were a fully matured band. They were becoming much more than a \\"Beat group from Liverpool.\\" Now, they were becoming experimental and ready to change music forever. And that's putting it nicely.    'Revolver' was released in 1966. There were two different track listings. The American release had 11 tracks (three of them had appeared on The Beatles' earlier studio album, 'Yesterday...And Today!,' a highly collectable Beatles record that's extremely rare -- but that's another story), and the British release, which had 14 songs.    When Parlophone/Capitol were rereleasing The Beatles catalogue for CD in 1990, the British edition was released on compact disc, and wisely so.    'Taxman' shows George Harrison at his angriest. It is one of the best anti-tax songs you'll find anywhere, if not, THE best. Harrison's voice is maturing here, and it certainly has matured a lot since the 'Help!' album. What a great way to open up this brilliant masterpiece.    'Eleanor Rigby' has become one of the Beatles' most recognizable and memorable songs. A #1 hit for the Fab Four, the song features Paul McCartney being accompanied by a string quartet. This is not the only time he sang with a string quartet; his 1965 #1 hit 'Yesterday' also featured a string quartet accompaniment. A ton of people have covered this classic, including Ray Charles.    Other songs like 'Love You To' (perhaps the Beatles' first exploration into Indian music, and certainly not their last), 'Good Day Sunshine,' 'Doctor Robert,' 'She Said She Said,' and of course, the #1 hit 'Yellow Submarine' all showed just how quickly the boys were growing up.    Perhaps my personal favorite Beatles song on the album is 'For No One.' Personally, I have always thought that this would have been a truly perfect fit on the band's previous album, 'Rubber Soul.' Right between 'Think For Yourself' and 'The Word.' If only it had been written and recorded in 1965 (sigh)... But it fits very well here too, and it has always been one of my favorites.    But perhaps technically the best song on the album is the last song. 'Tomorrow Never Knows' gave listeners a great taste of what was to come. In fact, a perfect taste of things to come. \\"Turn of your mind, relax, and float down stream...\\" is one of the best lines ever written in the history of the psychedelic rock genre, bar none. If you listen, you can hear traces of what the band would explore even further with on their next album, 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.'    And that's part of the charm of 'Revolver.' The Beatles explore with so many different styles here. Folk rock ('I'm Only Sleeping'), baroque pop rock ('Eleanor Rigby'), psychedelic rock ('Tomorrow Never Knows'), and blues rock ('Got to Get You into My Life'), among others. I'm quite convinced the Beatles took more chances with 'Revolver' than any other album, even 'Sgt. Pepper.' It's just so experimental.    Overall, you don't have a rock and roll collection until you have 'Revolver.' It's a fact. This is one of The Beatles' finest moments and well deserving of a thousand stars (five stars doesn't even touch how I feel about this album). You need to have 'Revolver' in your record collection, regardless if it is big or small. It should be a felony not to.    Highly, highly, highly, highly recommended to anybody who appreciates great music regardless of the genre.     ENJOY!!!

B002BWP4A6|5.0|I have read much about Michael Haneke, but have never seen a film of his until this one.  Haneke is a genuinely polarising filmmaker, some thinking he's a great artist and others who think he's a shock entertainer with no talent.  So I went to see what all the hoopla was about with this film, which many people are calling his best.<br /><br />This is a great film.<br /><br />The White Ribbon is a deeply haunting, cerebral, strange, rewarding film, one that will make you think for days afterwards (a critic reviewing this film said it would haunt you for days.  Try weeks!).  Shot in beautiful, shimmering black and white (in fact, this is some of the best photography in a film that I've ever seen), the story revolves around a German village just prior to WWI, and the strange, eerie, creepy, and unsettling things going on around it.  In some ways, The White Ribbon is reminiscent of unsettling horror films like Dreyer's Vampyr and many J-horror films (like Kurosawa's Cure) where things are deliberately left unanswered and the loose ends really puzzle you on a very deep, subconscious level.  Many films have loose ends but I don't think I've ever seen a film have as many loose ends as this one does, but that's a good thing.  The film even starts with a narrator saying \\"I think it happened this way.  I'm not really sure\\".  There are many nasty things going on, and many have suggested this is due to the repressed, religious upbringing of the village, but I'm not sure.  To Haneke's credit, he never answers these things directly, and he also doesn't answer them in interviews that he's done.  This makes the film far more effective and deeply troubling.  Even writing about the film now makes me uncomfortable.  It's that haunting, and that it is such a success on the arthouse circuit (it has already won the Palm d'Or at Cannes and just won a Golden Globe for Best Foreign film) is very encouraging.<br /><br />While I can't judge a filmmaker on only one film, I think Haneke may in fact be the real thing.  I plan on renting many more of his films (Cache and the original Funny Games), and I look forward to seeing more of his films..

0441009425|3.0|I read the first 20 pages or so before I could not bear through it any longer. Reading afterward on Wikipedia a summary of the book and of the larger Revelation Space universe just confirmed that the book would not be worth reading.<br /><br />The plot is goofy and unrealistic, from the small details to the big picture (the motivation of the Inhibitors for wiping out all civilizations). Characters are wooden, dialog is awful, plot is wobbly. In short, there are better books out there for SF lovers (try Iain Banks or Vernor Vinge, for example).<br /><br />Update:9/2013<br />The criticism that reading just a small portion of a book is not sufficient to judge it properly is fair enough. After a long hiatus I went back and read the whole thing. Well. I upgraded my rating to three stars. I could even give 3.5. The book does have its better moments and good insights. Overall however, the characters are inept, and the story feels  inplausible and contrieved in many places.  I liked much more author's \\"House of Suns\\" book.

B00006ZXSK|4.0|I won't rehash the plot -- several other reviewers did it well enough to leave it at their telling -- but I will say that after having watched it, oh, I don't know, at least 100 times, the only downside to this movie is the confusion in the accents.  They are supposed to be in France, but they all have English accents.  After many a viewing, it can become a bit jarring.  Other than that, it's lovely.  Oh, and worth a spot in your collection -- assuming you like warm, fuzzy feelings, of course.
0553712837|5.0|Skipping Christmas is a delightful novel that will make you laugh out loud!  The book on cd is even more funny because you can hear the inflection that the Author intended.  It is a book that I listen to every December, to enhance my Holiday Spirit.  The movie which is based on this book - Christmas With the Kranks - was very well done, but is still not as funny as listening to the book on cd!  A great buy that gives back to me every year I listen to it!  Definitely a Classic!
0385737424|5.0|This was our pick, among English teachers and our prescient school librarian, for the year's Newbery; we were thrilled to listen to the webcast and find out it won!  This is a terrific story, and it pays homage to A Wrinkle in Time.  Treat yourself; read this book.  Our librarian is so wise she picked it as a book for our Battle of the Books this year.       Our second pick, The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate, was an honor book; it is well worth your time.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|This was a good clean family movie. The songs in the movie were the later/newer/Miley songs which even adults can take a liking to, or at least tolerate. It was interesting, had very little lag time in the plot, and went from extremely funny to very sad smoothly in the blink of an eye while covering everything in between around that moment. It makes you want to keep watching to see how it all turns out!
1439102813|5.0|My father had Alheimer's and a friend of mine loaned me this book.  I could not put it down.  It's so different from all the books out there that are written for the caregiver in coping.  This is like being in an Alzheimer's patient's head.  When you read it, you understand their anger, frustration and all the other emotions that go with this disease.  I advise everyone to read it, because you will know someone some day that will have this condition and it will help you have a compassionate understanding.  The best thing is...it does NOT have a sad ending.  It ends from the perspective of the afflicted and so it helped me cope with my dad's eventual death.  Please read this book or suggest it to a friend who needs it.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I had read about this movie at wikipedia and thought it sounded interesting so I ordered it. It came in yesterday and I watched it this morning. It was all that I hoped it would be. It's true that if you liked Solaris you will like this. Sam Rockwell did an excellent job. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The acting was superb and the plot holds your interest. I find it amazing that this movie grossed so little world wide. It must have been poor marketing. I seldom recommend movies here but this is one I do. ENJOY!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Before I went to the IMAX to see the 3-D movie, I read these reviews first so this is for those wondering if you should fork out the extra cash for the IMAX and then another couple more to see the \\"IMAX-3-D\\" instead of the standard 3-D movie.<br /><br />The answer is YES.  Let me give you an example.  My \\"thrifty\\" boyfriend went to the $3 matinee at this cheap movie theater with smaller-than-your-average-theater screens with his friends.  I refused to go since I was not going to waste my time unless I got to see it in 3-D.  To him, it was a waste of money because his last 3-D IMAX movie experience 2-years ago left him disappointed and we'd both gotten headaches.  But I had read the \\"Avatar 3-D\\" hype and was willing to see if it really was going to be an \\"experience.\\"<br /><br />The next week was his birthday and he was rather put-out with me since as his birthday present I had gotten us tickets to see the \\"IMAX 3-D\\" Avatar at our local IMAX.  He could not fathom how I could waste all this cash when for a fraction of these IMAX tickets; we could have gone to see the $3 movie.<br />Since he enjoyed seeing Avatar without the 3-D, I asked him to tell me AFTER he saw the 3-D movie whether I had wasted my money or not.<br /><br />Needless to say, after the movie, all he kept repeating was my favorite phrase:  You're right.<br /><br />He mentioned the following that he enjoyed at the IMAX 3-D movie that he did not get to enjoy @ the bargain theater:<br /><br />1)  The movie previews were also shown in 3-D so you keep the 3-D glasses on the entire time.  One preview had a 3-D effect that was so good that you could hear the entire audience gasp in awe.<br /><br />2)  The IMAX \\"Experience\\" means that when a bomb goes off in the movie, you feel the bomb go off because the floor or chair shakes and maybe it was just us but we thought the air moved too.<br /><br />He said watching Avatar again but this time in 3-D was worth it.  I can't imagine not watching Avatar and especially the \\"Pandora\\" scenes in 3-D.  He agreed.  Best of all, neither of us got the 3-D headache.<br /><br />Nobody moved and nobody talked.  We all just sat and \\"experienced.\\"<br /><br />This is not the eye-crossing 3-D effect from decades ago like when I saw Friday the 13th part 3 in 3-D cardboard glasses to watch cheap effects like the eye-popping out of the screen.<br /><br />We thought we did well by getting there 40 mins early since we already had our tickets but if you want to see the 3-D movie from the middle of the screen, I suggest you get there earlier.<br /><br />FYI - This Saturday and Sunday at our IMAX 3-D Avatar movie viewings, both the 2:45pm matinees were sold out.her of us got the 3-D headache.    Nobody moved and nobody talked.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|There are no words to describe the beauty of this book.... I absolutely loved the DaVinci Code and Mr. Brown's analysis of the sacred feminine and its' suppression throughout history.  So I thought he could never come close to writing anything more beautifully brilliant and truthful than that.  But he proved me wrong with The Lost Symbol.  Because in The Lost Symbol, Dan Brown takes us yet another step higher on the ladder of truth, with the subject of enlightened mind, and truth, regarding the universal oneness of all relgion....all mixed in with his usual page-turning, suspenseful, good vs. evil, great storyline!  Also the location that Mr. Brown chose this time around for his tale, broadened the love and appreciation I already have for the land of my birth & the enlightened principles it was founded on....This book literally blew my mind!<br /><br />I would also venture to say, that considering the subjects Mr. Brown is choosing lately to mix in with his suspenseful tales....he has some very good karma coming to him! :-)  Thank you so much for writing this book, Mr. Brown...It meant more to me than you could possibly know.
B000003CMB|5.0|Without question, the number one live album of all time.  It is hard to believe the crispness of the sound is live vs. being created in the studio.  The blend of Dickie Betts guitar along with Duane Allman, and the rhythm created by Berry Oakley's bass and Greg Allman's keyboards create an unmatched sound.  The 13:04 minutes of In Memory of Elizabeth Reed are the finest minutes in all of rock music.
B000N3SSVM|5.0|i only review music that i will give 5 stars. and this one.... definitely needs 5 stars. perhaps more.     the second i heard this i was immediately addicted and listened to this album for about 4 months straight. 2 was just this album and then the other 2 was listen to one album and then this one and then another one and then this one.... etc.    i dont know how a human being came up with this. but it is so beautiful i simply have no words. if you havent heard it yet, you are really REALLY missing out.    EVERY single song is absolutely AMAZING. none are just \\"ok\\", they're AMAZING. love

B002RSDW80|4.0|The only difficult thing about watching this fun movie is trying to not be hungry.  I really enjoyed the two tales of Julia Child learning to cook French in the 1940's and Julie, an aspiring author who cooks all of Julia's recipes over the course of a year and blogs about it.  Meryl Streep never ceases to amaze me with her talent as Julia Child who gets the idea to publish a book for Americans on French Cooking.  She takes classes with some snooty men and is so determined to outdo them.    Julie, lives in Long Island City and by day travels to the city to be a customer service rep.  She also has a lunch with her own \\"snooty friends.  Her \\"friends\\" are too busy firing people and using their Blackberrys to take notice of Julie.    Julie starts a blog where she will cook one of Julia Child's recipes and give her opinion.  The blog starts becoming poplular and soon a food critic wants to come to her house.    The movie is a lot of fun and by the end of the movie the two stories finally converge.
B000H5TVKI|4.0|For me there was a noticeable improvement in quality with the blu-ray version of this film.  The original film quality wasn't that great, so I was pleasantly surprised to see how this one turned out.  Seemed like there was a marginal sound improvement as well.

0803731094|5.0|My son received this book when he was 2 1/2 and it was an instant hit in our family!  This tale of a mouse out-smarting a number of forest creatures, INCLUDING the imaginary Gruffalo entertains both children and parents alike.  It's rhyming text and repetition also lend it to easy memorization by children, and my son loves to \\"read\\" it aloud with us.  When my 3yr old niece came to visit, she loved hearing this story before bed as well.  It is now one of my favorite books to give as a gift!  We also bought the companion book, \\"The Gruffalo's Child\\" and my son enjoys it, too.  As a kindergarten teacher, I believe The Gruffalo should be on every child's bookshelf!
B001QWBM62|3.0|The Zoom H4n is a replacement for my H4.  I like it a lot.  The basic features in the STEREO Mode are easy to use, the menu structure is easy to navigate, and the ergonimic layout of the H4n itself is good.  I don't find the comment of some other reviewers that the SD card door might pop open allowing the SD card to pop out to be a concern. The downside:  Now I need to buy _The Zoom H4n User Guide For English Speaking Users_.  Some of the more powerful features are in the MTR(Multi-Track)mode.  The Operation Manual that comes with the H4n (H4n-5000-1 is the part number on the back cover) does a good job of explaining WHAT the recorder can do but trying to figure out HOW to use these MTR capabilities remains a mystery due to the fractured English used attempting to outline some critical explanations.   Bottom Line:  Hardware: *****  Manual **
B002M3SOWO|5.0|Lightening Thief had people of all ages believing in the magic of Greek mythology.  Percy Jackson had kids reading like no other book had.     All the books in the series were wonderful.  The last Percy Jackson is no exception to the rule.     It was amazing that Percy made us laugh and still was under the stress of being a hero.  The ending to the series was intense and funny as Percy comes face to face with Kronos himself.     This book ties in all the characters and helps us understand why things had happened.  Luke's past is finally explained, this helps us understand why Luke made the mistakes he did.     This book is perfect for any child and will have them wanting more more.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|i've always loved the Bee Gees. there songwriting, vocal harmonys, versatility and crisp Production always moved me then and still now.when they first started out they were very Beatles influenced and seem like a knockoff version, however in the 70's the Bee Gees sharpen up there pens, got tighter with there vocals and found there Groove and the rest as they say is history.  the songs on here speak for themselves over 30 plus years later these songs still sound fresher than most of what is out today. so many classics and songs that are known word for word and still being grooved to and covered. they are One of the Greatest Musical acts Ever to me.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|The Bottom Line:    This fusion of two subtly-sadistic auteurs in director Tim Burton and children's novelist Roald Dahl makes for a much better film than I expected when I saw the trailers back in 2005; I don't think it's as good as Gene Wilder's version, but it hits enough different notes that it can be treated as a separate film rather than a remake, and a good film at that.    3/4

B002RKXO6S|3.0|The Circle is by no means anywhere in the league that the masterpiece 80s and first half of the 90s albums were. It is the best album Bon Jovi have brought out since the only good for a frisbee album crush started the run of very, very average albums. There's no big hits on here, there's nothing that'll even probably be played in years to come on the radio, the only song that may make the concert playlist is the first We Weren't Born to Follow which seems to be what it was written for. By the way if you have never been to a Bon Jovi concert, definitely do so, a better live act you won't come across. The rest on this album are pretty much just fillers but they are mostly quite pleasant to listen to fillers background music pretty much. Lyric wise a lot are questionable, the time taken to write those lyrics seems rushed, music wise, there's nothing special in any of them and a few sample riffs from old big hits, others just seem like remakes of what they've done before.<br /><br />When Were Beautiful - sound like it should be on a soundtrack playing in the background of a scene with a big open sky or something. It's all right but nothing to recommend the album.<br /><br />Work for the Working Man - Samples the intro guitar riff from Livin' on a Prayer and plays it over and again throughout the song rather than coming up with something original. I like that riff, but if I want to hear it I'll put on Slippery When Wet. It's not bad for a filler song on this album but it's obviously has no potential to be a single. A thing about Bon Jovi's great albums was every song had the potential to be a smash hit. As far as songs representing the working class man though, there's a lot better out there. The lyrics aren't really clear on what this song is supposed to be telling us either. Is the working man in trouble? Is he prosperous? &#34;Whose going to work the working man, hurt for the working man?&#34; Did the working man just win lotto? Become a rock star? Who knows. Guess it's hard to write a song about the working man when you've had millions of dollars and women throwing themselves at you your whole adult life, however they did do it well in the past, Dry County for example.<br /><br />Superman Tonight - Sounds like the soundtrack songs that used to play during low budget 80s TV shows like The Henderson Kids. Lyrics ask whose going to save you from a bunch of scenarios and the character singing wishes he could be your superman tonight? Why can't he? Unless he's dead or a ghost or something, I don't see the problem.<br /><br />Bullet - Sounds a bit like Hey God from These Days lyrics and intro musically wise. It even mentions God in the same context &#34;God are you listening&#34;. Run out of ideas fellas? With lyrics like &#34;What is the distance between a bullet and a gun?&#34; it's no wonder their stealing from past work. I mean what is that, couldn't find a tape measure? Why would you need to know this anyway. Won't it change when either of these items is picked up?<br /><br />Thorn in My Side - Lyrics to a very basic guitar riff. Bon Jovi sings a song to a thorn, yes a thorn, that is embedded in his side. He basically tells the thorn his life story (well not his own, but the character he is portraying). Apparently there is some danger that this thorn will take his pride, is stopping him from running, and pestering him in other ways. Just pull it out Jon! Get some tweezers if you can't get a grip with your hands. Singing to it is not going to solve anything!<br /><br />Live Before You Die - When this first started playing I thought it was just a remake of the song These Days. It's not, it's basically a bunch of different people throughout his life that tell him you've got live before you die. Would have thought that was pretty obvious, but maybe not! And what's this there's one thing he never forgets &#34;when you're young you always think, the sun is going to shine&#34;. Wtf is this? Is this an environmental message that pollution will block out the sun in the years ahead? Who knows!<br /><br />Brokenpromiseland - A song with a basic guitar riff rotated over and over again. Bon Jovi tells us to imagine a vision of angels falling out of the sky. I think there's some sort of war waging on between good and evil. Either that or God has broken his promise to the worshipers and the character singing is breaking out of the church/cult or whatever. Lyric wise it is refreshing to see something completely new but musically it is another filler. Surprisingly Desmond Child co-wrote this one.<br /><br />Loves the Only Rule - Computer game sounding background sounds with a guitar playing. Basically this upbeat song is telling the listener the only rule is love. Everything else you've heard is wrong and you should do what do most would just call you crazy for doing Eg &#34;Fly like an aeroplane, dance in the pouring rain, spit in the eye of a hurricane&#34;, the advice is limited to what rhymes with these lines. Probably one the best of these songs on The Circle.<br /><br />Fast Cars - This must be some game Bon Jovi, Richie, Tico or David plays with their kids that somehow got recorded as a song. In it Bon Jovi pretends they (him and whoever he's singing to) are fast cars and role plays through the lyrics. If you're under ten, you'll love it! Maybe if you've also got kids you'll enjoy playing it and singing along with them. If not you'll probably just press skip.<br /><br />Happy Now- Asks what you would say to him if he told you he had a dream. Then tells you he wants to start a fight and throw rocks and starts demanding that you don't try to drag him down. Is he drunk or insane, either way you're leaving the house for while and maybe returning with the cops.<br /><br />Learn to Love - Lots of piano action in this one. Sings in a slurred drunken manner (probably the same character from the song before after a few more drinks) that you've got to learn to love the world you're in . Then recounts some suicidal experience where he held a gun in his hands. If you didn't change the locks after the last song you will after this.<br /><br />There's no songs on The Circle that will be requested on the radio in decades or even years to come. Nothing but We Weren't Born to Follow are likely to make the playlists in future concert years, fans won't be holding out to hear any of these. saying all that though, most are quite good as background music even if the lyrics are a bit average. An album of what would be fillers on early career albums are actually quite listenable to. Well except for Fast Cars, unless your ten!on will block out the sun in the years ahead?

B000FA5TTW|1.0|I read this book in it's regular paperback form because it was given to me by my Son for Christmas this year.  I finished the book for the same reason.  I found the book to wander along, jump around and be hard to follow.  The character of Susie was too laid back to believe.  The descriptions of the different \\"heavens\\" began well and then would dissolve leaving the reader wondering if the writer fell asleep during that part of production.  The sentiment behind the book is there, though veiled thru the many, many, many characters and their comings and goings.  This is the first time that I have ever hoped that the movie is nothing like the book.
B000V9KFLY|2.0|I love the music on this CD and was disappointed that it would not play in my car.  They were great on the refund.
B000063UR2|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Tim Curry (and his incredible makeup/costume artists) makes for a pretty good antagonist but Tom Cruise is a blank as the lead and the whole story feels like someone took the odds and ends from better stories and mashed them together to make a film the world didn't need; the film has acquired a cult around it, no doubt helped by the fact that it was directed by Ridley Scott, but Legend really isn't worth your time.    2/4

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Usually I look for the post-apocalyptic zombie movies, but this one stood out to me, and I really enjoyed watching it. I purchased this as a gift, and they were happy to get it!
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I spent hours researching Tritton AX Pro, Astro A40 system (w/ mixamp), Turtle Beach Ear Force HPX, Sennheiser PC350, and the X41s--all for use with the Xbox 360 Elite console. I finally settled on the X41s.    They arrived, quickly, thanks to Amazon.    Out of the box the product looks like a toy.  Turtle beach uses bright, primary green coloring on packaging.  Graphics look cartoonish.  Both the headphones and transmitter are made of light weight plastic--the kind I find on my son's remote control cars--suggestive of toy land gaming instead of high end, high performance audio. The power button, volume control, and on/off bass control all sit on the left can.  Each control felt brittle to the touch.  Each rattled in its socket.  Again, little different than the controls lodged on kid's toys.      I handled the headphones gingerly.  The build just seemed to demand it.      Set up took under three minutes.  Stunningly simple plug and play.  Popped these on my head and played.  No wires--wireless controllers, wireless headphones.  At the end of a late night session just hang the phones on the stand, close the cabinet and you've got a pristine living room.  Simple and clean.    I play Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 almost exclusively.    Sound was . . . decent.  True 7.1 surround sound.  Unsophisticated though. Low end bass present but distant.  Tried the on/off base function.  No discernible difference.  Mid and high range sounds are indistinct, at times garbled.  Loud, though, loud.  And enveloping.  Orders of magnitude better than TV speakers and even my Klipsch audio system.      Critical to COD: MW2 is the sound of footsteps.  In recent days, I've logged a couple of killstreaks using audio alone.  But not using the X41s.  Read on.      The X41s registered footsteps--from all directions.  I could not pinpoint direction.  Sounds trickled in both cans but couldn't tease out footsteps from background sound effects.    Not a subtle sound quality but surely loud from all directions.    Forgot I was wearing the headphones at one point and wandered into the kitchen to respond to wife's questioning.  Nasty hissing, crackling, and popping erupted in both ears, loud and immediate.  I laughed and returned to the 15 foot radius.  No further problems . . . until about the tenth day.    Put the kids to bed.  Wife plopped at her computer.  Turned out the lights and sat down to play.  Ungodly, painful cracking, hissing, and popping penetrated my skull.  Sound dropped mid game, came back, morphed into cracking, condensed into several loud pops then returned.  Intolerable.  Absolutely intolerable.  I replaced the batteries.  No effect.  Tried to reach support forums at Turtle Beach.  Forums under construction--no access.    That night I re-packaged them for return to Amazon.    Absolutely intolerable to be aurally assaulted by a $200 toy during the sole 90 minute time slot I carved out to play.  And, intolerable for merely decent sound.  Decent, mind you.  Decent.    There were red flags.  A smattering of posts/reviews mentioned the popping sound but I dismissed them as probable anomalies or user error.  An audible hissing appeared when I first connected the headphones.  Slight but sharp pops occurred when moving between screens using the console.  The nasty interference appeared when out of range and when batteries ran low.  I dealt with all as idiosyncratic quirks.    But, sudden melt down with no fix?  No go.    I run a wireless home network.  We rely heavily on it, primarily for my wife's consulting business but also for media streaming.  We live in an apartment building.  Twenty odd neighbor SSIDs float around our unit.  The phone is wireless.  The Xbox controllers are wireless.  The microwave emits it's beams.  Its a real live operating household we have here.    The X41s couldn't handle it.  The interference disrupts the radio signal.    Much like the infrared X4s the X41s work . . . almost.  Wireless unit that functions randomly in a wireless environment?  Untenable catch-22. Intolerable flaw at any price.    I am no pro gamer nor an audiophile.  I loved the simple set up and kick-back wire free gaming.  They stowed quickly so no hassle from the wife for my toys laying around.  The transmitter had a jack for wired headphones so friends could connect too.  Nice.  But . . . flawed, painfully (literally) flawed.    I skipped the Tritton AX Pros--too fragile.  Scads of reviews mentioned wire nests and breakage.  I veered clear of Astro A40--too expensive, too hyped.  Checked at Sennheiser PC350--too serious, no support for Xbox 360 without a mixamp, and too pricey.    Ultimately, I sucked it up and bought the A40s.  Did it the same night I re-packaged the X41s.  Spend high dollar to get quality right?  Naive?    I worried about all the wires, about the fact that I'd now have to sit within wire length of the console, tethered like a pet.  I worried about they over-hyped sound quality.  And the price, the price.    Turns out, I love the A40 mixamp. Skip the A40 headphones-- they do pump out beautiful, clear, distinct mid-range sounds.  Bullets snap and whine.  Foot steps, weapon reloads, the hum of machinery is all clear.  Stand by a computer in an office building and listen to the whir.  No kidding.  All muted, though, oddly distant.  Audio mavens call it the \\"sound stage\\".  A40s place you in the back third of the theater seating in my opinion.  And the low end bass is downright wimpy.  So, I will be returning them.     The Astro mixamp supports 3rd party headphones. Purchased the Turtle Beach Ear Force HPXs ([...]) after reading more reviews.      The Astro mixamp + HPX provides the solution for me.  Metal and substantive matte black plastic comprise both the headphones and the mixamp.  They look adult, professional.  Astro packaging is stunning (I know it seems trivial but there's a strong relationship between packaging and performance.  Believe it.)  Mixamp comes with a host of wires/adapters.  Fear not.  Simple to set up.    Current system generates outstanding, vivid, directional quality.  The sound is immediate.  Puts you in the opera boxes.  Until I improve, the few killstreaks I manage come from audio alone.  Its fantastic!  The direction, even the angle of approach is discernible.  I tracked down a sniper listening solely to the report of the .50 cal--as useful or more useful than the red radar blips the pop up when some one is firing.  Super helpful in hardcore mode without the radar.   Stand on the other side of a wall while listening to a firefight.  You know exactly where the other players fall.  Puts a grin on your face and a couple more kills toward a streak when the winner stumbles out the door and you blast him.    My current set up is all wired.  I am tethered.  Buy the 12 foot optical cable.  The mixamp USB power cord extends 8-9 feet.  The longer optical cable + long power cable let you place the mixamp right next to your seat.  The short Xbox voice cord connecting controller to mixamp and the short cord from phones to mixamp prove no problem.  Sit anywhere you want within the radius the longest cable provides.  Ok, the wire nest does cover the floor.  Wives and children pose a threat to the nest.  So, you'll have a little clean up.  So what?  C'mon.    My conclusion: despite the hype, wired connections still trump wireless--both for sound and reliablity.  In my opinion, wireless audio remains adolescent all claims to the contrary.  And, digitally simulated Dolby surround sound still, somehow (not a tech audio super engineer), weirdly pales in comparison.  It is sophisticated but thin or wan--a photo-shopped model on a glossy page just not the real thing.    The HPXs have five--count 'em--five speakers in each can.  Mechanically complex.  I am sure they'll fail.  I am sure digital software tech will far outstrip them leaving me at Dolby 5.1 instead of Dolby XX.1 released within the next few nanoseconds.    All said, you know what? At $80 withthe Astro A40 mixamp they're the answer.  Today.  And they'll work--all day.    By the way,  I connected all three head sets to my iPod to check out music quality.  Gaming headsets are just not set up for high-end audiophilia.  No luck.  They're better than the iPod earbuds, true.  Oh, faint praise. Get the high-end Sennheiser's (HD650) for music uber-listening.  I suspect they'd work well for gaming too.
0743487486|2.0|I've read The Homework Myth by Kohn, and really liked it, but this was a giant yawn.  I think the difference is that you can say, \\"homework is bad and here are a thousand studies to back that up.\\"  The logical conclusion: teachers should not assign homework.  That's easy enough to follow through on.  Parenting, however, is far more complicated.  So when you make statements saying you shouldn't do X or you should do Y, you had better be ready to give your readers some good examples to help them understand how these principles could work in their own lives.  He did not do enough of that to help me (perhaps I'm a total dope) get a feel for how I could be more unconditional.  I felt like the most interesting parts of the books were the studies he quoted, not his actual philosophy.      I think that if you want to parent your children unconditionally, and you want some really good advice and some actual direction on how to create this environment in your home, read How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, and How to Listen So Kids will Talk.  Similar theory, better concrete examples, and less showiness--Kohn just really seemed to enjoy showing his readers how many studies he's read, and how philosophical he can get on the subject... I also sense a bit of \\"I'm a better parent than you\\" in there too.  Chances are if you picked this book up, you don't care what kind of parent HE is... you care what kind of parent YOU are. Skip this one.
B002K0WBXW|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Much as I hate formula, I have a soft spot for romantic comedies because the ones which feature good chemistry between the leads always offer some interesting character interaction; that said, it is my displeasure to inform you that The Proposal hastily skips past all of that pesky character bonding--save for one scene with the two leads in their bedroom talking--to focus on the stupid formula hijinx, resulting in a pretty bad film.    2/4
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Singer-songwriter Alicia Keys continues to push her creative and vocal limits on the well-constructed concept album The Element of Freedom. Keys treks the much-traveled road to personal freedom, encountering the typical emotional barriers along the way. But it is Keys' vocal commitment and indomitable spirit that renew time-exhausted ideals found in \\"Love Is Blind\\" and \\"How It Feels to Fly.\\" She even manages to create the indispensable anthem for Olympic-bound athletes everywhere in the stirring \\"Wait Til You See My Smile.\\"<br /><br />Throughout Freedom, Keys applies the soulful pop sensibilities that catapulted her into prominence three albums ago. She offers the empowering \\"Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" and catchy \\"Doesn't Mean Anything,\\" a melodic clone of her 2007 hit \\"No One.\\" Beyonc&eacute; helps propel the snappy \\"Put it in a Love Song,\\" hinting at another potential \\"Put a Ring on It\\" viral social networking moment.<br /><br />The journey reaches a fitting crest on \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down,\\" Key's short, but moving homage to New York City as the often-romanticized symbol of hope. In the `concrete jungle where dreams are made of,' Key proclaims `there's nothing that you can't do' -- her sentiment warm, inviting, and convincing enough to book the flight.<br /><br />Key tracks: Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down, Love Is Blind, Sleeping with a Broken Heart.

B000065V42|3.0|Good old movie for the kids and the family.  Received the DVD quickly, but it was scratched and caused one scene to skip.  I did not bother to contact the seller, so I am not sure if the seller would offer a replacement.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I remember my family and I renting Electric Dreams in the early 90's, when I was a little kid. I was amazed by the cinematography and the music, but I was still baffled by a majority of the plot (\\"How did the computer come to life? And who is it in love with?\\"). Now, in the new millennium, I tried to come back to the film, which is really hard since there are only VHS copies and online sites for this film. I did manage to see it again in full, and for the second time, I was in awe with this movie. This is an 80's film with a typical 80's MTV style. A young man's computer amazingly comes to life, and soon, there's a love triangle between the man, his girlfriend, and his computer. Sounds like a sci-fi horror film, doesn't it? Well, it's not. It's a mix of drama, comedy, and sci-fi. And I love it. It has a clever story, interesting characters, and some lovely 80's music. And I'm sure other people will be entertained by it.....if it actually comes out on DVD. There are dozens and dozens of people, myself included, who are waiting for the DVD release of Electric Dreams. But as of now, there hasn't been any progress. What's up with that? Well, if the film DOES come out on DVD or even Blu-Ray pretty soon, I won't hesitate to purchase it here on Amazon.
0786838655|4.0|If you know anything about Greek mythology, you'll know that their gods had a tendency to produce demigod kids by the dozen. So it's not too hard to guess what \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is about -- a boy who discovers that he's the offspring of a god, and the other demi-god kids that he gets to know at a very, very special camp. While the introduction is a bit rocky, Rick Riordan spins a clever fast-moving adventure that mines ancient mythology and gives it a modern spin.<br /><br />Percy Jackson has always been a troublemaker, but he's shocked when some truly strange things begin to happen in his life -- and especially when a minotaur appears and attacks his car. When he comes to, he learns that he's at a special training camp called Camp Half-Blood intended for demi-god children, and that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr bodyguard. Though Percy is understandably resistant to the idea, he soon makes friends in the sharp Annabeth and the bitter Luke (and enemies with the kids from Cabin Ares).<br /><br />Oh yes, and he finds that he's the son of the god Poseidon... which is a problem since the \\"Big Three\\" gods have sworn an oath not to father any more kids, due to a rather ominous prophecy.<br /><br />The problem is that Zeus and Poseidon are also having a feud at the moment, due to the loss of Zeus's master lightning bolt -- and Zeus believes that Percy is the culprit. And if things aren't patched up by the summer solstice, the forces of sky and sea will go to war. To save civilization -- and someone dear to him -- Percy must venture into the world of the dead...<br /><br />\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is all a little Harry Potter in concept -- ordinary kid discovers he has magical powers, and is taught in a specialized school/camp with other kids like him. Rick Riordan spends the first half of the book exploring the nature of Camp Half-blood and the various demi-god kids, as well as dropping hints about Percy's parentage. Although, given the number of times he makes water misbehave, you would think someone would have guessed.<br /><br />Fortunately the plot picks up about halfway through, when the whole matter of the bolt and thieving gods comes into play. Riordan has a snappy fast-moving style, and he peppers the story with plenty of plot twists and monstrous action. And he has quite a sharp-edged sense of humor -- the snarkiness is a bit annoying in the first chapter, but after that he produces some fun dialogue (\\"Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm.\\" \\"Nonsense. Boy wouldn't feel a thing\\").<br /><br />And he does a good job with the concept of gods and monster surviving over the center of the western world, as well as spoking some fun at the gods' behavior. Example: Dionysius whining \\"Father loves to punish me. The first time, Prohibition. Ghastly!\\"<br /><br />I found Percy rather annoying in the first couple chapters, but Riordan slowly evolves him from a rather bratty, rebellious kid to a reluctant budding hero. Annabeth is an excellent counterpart to Percy, smart and measured if rather haughty in attitude, while Grover is a likable little sidekick who is chewing his nails over the possibility of losing his job. And the supporting cast of gods and demigods is pretty well-drawn, especially the paternal Chiron and embittered Luke.<br /><br />It's not brilliant, but \\"The Lightning Thief\\" is a solidly written fantasy/adventure yarn, which leaves the door open for more adventures from Perseus Jackson.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|How lame was the bit with Pierce Brosnan singing and punching his fist in the air, \\"real manly stuff\\" and to think this girlie man was once James Bond.    And Merryl Streep still can't act.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|This movie will rate 5 stars for many. It was nice to see Mr. Spock one more time. Production values are top rate but this is a very different Star Trek than what I think of as Star Trek. This is more like Buck Rodgers or Battlestar Gallactica. There is nothing much to reflect on. It is more good guy, bad guy and that makes money in Hollywood. It may make a difference if you know that, \\"The Undiscovered Country - Star Trek 6 is my personal favorite Star Trek. I also did not like the first Star Trek Movie. I am still waiting one more TGN Star Trek...
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Foot of the Mountain being 9th and final studio album from the group A-HA and was released in 2009. The sound is throwback to their earlier releases and sounds like synthpop, new wave and pop rock. The sound is very reminiscent of early 80's groups like Ultravox, Erasure and Naked Eyes. The best tracks on this release are \\"Foot of the Mountain\\", \\"Nothing is keeping you here\\" and \\"Shadowside\\". All the lyrics are included in the booklet and a list of additional musicians. The album peaked at #5 in the UK charts and did even better in Norway (#2). 5/5.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Faith or Nothing!<br /><br />Denzel Washington is amazing as a wanderer, who's been walking the roads for the last thirty years heading west, a man on a mission.  What's the goal?  Even he is not sure.  Just that he'll know it when he sees it.  He carries the book in his bag and protects it at all costs.<br /><br />The world is a rough place after the bombs dropped.  The giant crater holes, the broken fragments of Man's civilization to where people have degraded to biker gangs and every person for themselves.<br /><br />Only the older men and women who are literate have any hold on anyone else.  Books were burned and banned soon after the war to \\"prevent this from happening again.\\"  Clearly a Fahrenheit 451 reference.  Keep the people ignorant and they can be more easily controlled.<br /><br />Gary Oldman plays a guy who is running a town where he knows this is true.  He gets his biker gangs to go out and search for the book.  The Book that will get him control over the masses.  Using the words from the Bible will get him to raise up and take control over the cities in his area.  From history it is not the first time that faith in the Bible and religion has led to control over populations.<br /><br />But the film is not saying that Oldman's character is right.  In fact, the selfless faith is what triumphs at the end.<br /><br />And what an ending there is!  Can't spoil it, sorry.<br /><br />The younger people in the film, the woman that befriends him and others, cannot read and have never learned to read.  The biker gang leaders can't read and they don't care -- they'll kill, rape and steal for a decent barter & trade.  The woman can't read either, but wants to know of the old days.  She starts out as a lousy character, frankly, but then develops into a strong character near the end of the film.<br /><br />The photography with the washed-out colors and the sepia toned landscape and people was wonderfully shot and along with the stark music, gives a depressing yet hopeful mood.<br /><br />Favorite scenes:<br /><br />The silhouette where Denzel is whipping out his blade and slicing and dicing the bad guys, hand flies off, a few gut slices and blood splashes.  Yuk.<br /><br />The stark, barren landscape, the blackened craters.  The sun so bright that everyone has to wear shades (apparently the ozone layer has been wiped out).<br /><br />The old couple in a farm house who have a different taste in meat than most.  :)<br /><br />This is not a religious film.  It's not even a film of having a religion.  It's about knowledge.  The smart, literate ones know the way to rebuild.  The illiterate ones want only to survive.  The stupid, literate ones want power.<br /><br />Will Eli live long enough to see his dream happen?  The ending will surprise you, it clearly is not a pat, predictable story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.where Denzel is whipping out his blade and slicing and dicing the bad guys, hand flies off, a few gut slices and blood splashes.

B002RSDW80|4.0|Meryl Streep's performance was absolutely excellent in this film. You don't see her at all, you see Julia! I thought her story was wonderfully told and well written. However, the character Julie could've been tossed. She came out as whiny and self-centered. Honestly, a biographical film about Julia Child would have been much better and more interesting. I took my Grandma to see this when it came out and we both enjoyed it. It's a sweet film overall and you'll be craving French food made with butter for weeks afterward!
B000O178BY|5.0|Year Zero being NIN's 6th studio album and 2007 release is a mix of industrial rock and experimental rock. Being a fan of Skinny Puppy, Laibach and many other experimental groups this is in my opinion a brilliant recording. The album did very well both with the critics and the public at large. The album peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200, and top ten in the UK, Germany and Finland. Allmusic gave this album 4.5 and Rolling Stone 4/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet but does not contain any photographs or a list over whom plays what. 5/5.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|\\"The Fall\\" is a fantastic album by all means; I was expecting her to follow the same formula that made her a star; an impeccable blend of bluesy jazz and pop and the album did not disappoint me. The silky feel of her voice and more authentic and fresh songs makes this record really appealing. She is definitely getting better over time!
B001UW58WW|5.0|Very wonderful - my husband was thrilled - we have gotten tickets to see David Garrett in concert
B001CTDH76|5.0|This is a great video series and I received excellent service when I ordered on line.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Wow, that was bad.     Unlike the directors' earlier effort, The Matrix, which had a level of substance beneath all of the style, this was all sound and fury signifying nothing.  First of all, there didn't seem to be any physics associated with the cars.  They spin and fly around the track but there's no real sense that they're heading toward a finish line let alone moving in the same direction.  It's more like watching a neon lit demolition derby.     When I was a kid, the only car I wanted to own was the Mark V. But in this movie it didn't really stand out from the other race cars. And the fact that it was so easily replaced by the Mark VI for the final race reinforced that feeling. In the cartoon, the Mark V was the ultimate driving machine. It was a car that James Bond wished he could drive. In this movie, it was disposable, just one in a series.  How disappointing.    Overall I didn't have a problem with the characters and I'm happy they didn't try to mimic the iconic fast-talking of the cartoon. That said, the coarse language peppered through the script was completely out of place for what should have been a straight up kids movie.      And that's the core issue with Speed Racer.  It didn't know who its audience was.  Was it the under 10 set who wouldn't care about the story as long as the interesting visuals kept coming?  Or was it trying to make a kids movie cool enough for teenagers through swearing?    To say they missed an opportunity here is too strong a statement.  Speed Racer as 1960 cartoon or modern movie is a confection.  Think of it as cotton candy.  You can't complain that it doesn't fill you up because it isn't meant to.  It's supposed to be a burst of sugar to the system that fades almost as quickly as it arrives.  But by pandering to two audiences at the same time this cotton candy is cheeseburger flavored.  It's too adult for kids, and not adult enough for teenagers.  It's a movie without an audience and it's no wonder it performed so poorly at the box office.

0786868724|5.0|I loved this book.  I learned a lot about the Jewish faith and just faith in general.  I'm beginning to think that when God wants a story told, he calls Mitch Albom.  I've never encountered anybody like he has...Morrie and Al Lewis and Pastor Henry.  I'm almost envious of the guy. I guess as an avid reader, I sort of know them but it isn't quite the same.<br /><br />Anyway, the book made me laugh and cry just like the rest of the books I've read by Albom but none of them made me sob like this one did.  I had to put the book down for a bit after I read the eulogy.  It was so beautifully written and after reading the entire story, I couldn't help but fall apart.<br /><br />It took me a day to read it with a few breaks.  Once you start, you won't stop until the last page.  Unless you're like me and have to take a break after the eulogy.<br /><br />Fantastic book.  I'm going to read it again in a couple of weeks.  I bet I get more out of it than I did the first time around.<br /><br />I had to wait almost a month for this order to come from Amazon.  That was the only part that was a drag.
B002XUL85G|5.0|I'll keep this short. I enjoyed this movie. It wasn't the scariest movie ever, and I didn't jump out of my skin. But I did enjoy the tension and the atmosphere this film created. I liked the special effects as well. I would recommend this movie to my friends, and if you're a big fan like me, I would definetally recommend this collector's edition set with t-shirt and film cell from the movie.   If you haven't seen this movie yet, and are considering it, please, watch it in the dark and crank up the volume. It makes for a more enjoyable experience.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|When I first purchased this in 1980, punk and new wave rock had a bad reputation with the Sex Pistols and other ranting pogo-dancing head bangers. This album gave it credibility because it was so eclectic and creative. They also were one of the greatest rock bands in the world during that time..if not the best. Every cut is done with urgency...every cut is so different. Very cimematic in scope. The production especially is superb..something usually not expected from a punkesque band. How can you go wrong with titles like \\"Rudy Can't Fail, Lost In The Supermarket, Hateful, Spanish Bombs, The Right Profile (a song about doomed actor Montgomery Clift) Brand New Cadillac etc. This band was bursting at the seams with creativity. It's unfortunate that most people didn't even bother because they were so different in scope. When I played this album to my friends they all thought I'd joined a skinhead group, and really didn't give it a chance. If it didn't sound like The Eagles, Steely Dan or The Beatles they dismissed it as fluff. That's how superficial most listeners are. When leader Joe Strummer died in 2002 at age 50 of a heart attack, most people hardly knew about it or cared. Nobody mentioned it on the news or in the papers. Well, over 30 years after the release of London Calling, I've come to the conclusion that THIS IS ONE OF THE 10 BEST ROCK ALBUMS IN HISTORY. I still get all revved up when I hear it. If you love rock and roll...this one is an all-time gem. A ROCK MASTERPIECE! Time has proven that!

0751529818|5.0|This book rocked my world so much that I bought copies for my kindergartner and second grader.  I know they won't read them now but I figured that someday when they're older, they can read their books and actually learn a life lesson.  This book made me laugh and made me cry but most importantly, it made me think.  Morrie was a gift to the world and I think anybody that was lucky enough to come in contact with him, even through this book, will be touched in a good way.<br /><br />I had the book read in less than a day.  You won't want to put it down once you start.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Anyone who says French guys are wimps (hey, JC!) oughta be forced to view Man on Wire. Just sitting through this film in the comfort of my media room, seeing its shots of the enormity of the height of the World Trade Center and contemplating what Philippe Petit undertook made my blood pressure shoot up to stroke levels. Petit's walk between the twin towers nearly forty years ago shows how great/insane/driven the human species can be, and how very different we all are, for I personally can think of few things more horrific than walking on a thin wire at a great height. (Let alone dancing, sitting, lying and trotting across the wire, as Petit did!) Years ago in college my roommate's brother, himself a rock climber and thrill seeker, used to try to explain to me that there is a \\"black line\\" in climbing, a hypothetical point, usually set at fifty feet, below which survival from a fall is possible and above which survival is impossible. \\"Once you pass the black line, height becomes meaningless and you might as well be climbing at  a mile as fifty-one feet.\\" Be that as it may, even thinking about the feat depicted in this award winning film set me off into hissy fits of couch potato wussiness.<br /><br />All that said, I didn't find Man on Wire to be five-star material. It was interesting, it set my pulse racing, it was certainly a valuable documentary on a great moment in lawbreaking history, but it was also maddeningly uneven in its pace and structure. As the person who watched it with me commented, \\"Blink twice and you miss him doing the actual walk.\\" An exaggeration, but I did find myself wishing more time had been spent showing the actual walk and letting its participants tell of the aftermath of the undertaking than in showing us for what felt the third or forth time the process of hiding under canvas in the planning stage while scoping out the Trade Center. Perhaps having Philppe Petit talk about his feelings on the loss of those grand structures would have added a postscript of sorts to it all, too.<br /><br />Man on Wire is well worth seeing and even owning. It is a window into the mind of an exceptional man and a look back at a time that was both relatively recent and artificially long ago. Also, to stop you from asking the question (you know who you are) yes, I have this film on Blu-ray, but I just liked the cover of the DVD version Amazon shows better so am using it for my review here.ipt of sorts to it all, too.

He claims you'll have time for nothing else, but following your passion.

B000ZN802W|4.0|I remember reading the actual account this film was based on & I felt sad. From what I read, I assumed that the subject of the news article had been suffering from some form of mental illness. So I knew the ending & this movie provided the history.<br /><br />Sean Penn's film presents us a young man who is not mentally disturbed, but a person who is clearly \\"troubled,\\" a person seeking a Self unstiffled by the realities of modern, materialistic society. This causes him to engage in very few relationships, and those he does form are on his own terms & with his right to terminate at any time. This is more than a kid running from a bickering upper middle class mother & father. I don't know how many other viewers saw the hero (anti-hero hero really) as much mentally ill as a rebel. When you do see it that way, you can't help but sympathize with the parents--and particularly with the sister who seemed very close to him.<br /><br />In the opening sequence, we see Nemo (I call the main character \\"Nemo\\" because he saw himself as a reality in search of an identity)graduate from college & offered a place at Harvard. His parents are ectsatic, but he's not interested. The fact that he graduated with honors does not necessarily rule out mental illness. Schizophrenia, for example, often doesn't manifest until young adulthood.<br /><br />Nemo carries on full conversations with  himself, acting out the parental anger & dysfunction. A major symptom of schizophrenia. He makes up wild names for himself. Another sign of borderline personality disorder. However, his quest for perfect freedom in Alaska is on a par with any one who is inspired by a goal, vision of a painting, etc. Nemo logically plans his quest over an extended period of time, demonstrating that if he IS mentally ill, at least he's very high functioning.<br /><br />I see Nemo's Alaska goal as being a form of \\"The Great Work\\" for him. It's accomplishment will free him from the lower forms of reality & raise him into unified, perfected/pure consciouness, a transcendental unity with One. He has overcome his father & mother and in doing so, has become his OWN father & mother. He states as much in the course of the movie. This is a metaphor of alchemy & magick ritual--it is also found in the New Testament teachings of Josahua ben Joseph (Jesus.) Nemo has also cut off the emotional attachment to his sister, his last long term relationship. He does not have sex--even when offered by a beautiful girl. Celibacy, another stage of The Work. He eats strange plants & roots--yep, yet another stage. Finding the bus in the middle of a gorgeous nowhere was like a gift from a spirit, an offering literally out of the blue.<br /><br />When in extremis, he encounters a bear who snifs him, then passes casually on. A totem image? hallucination? The bus was as much a gift as it was as a warning he failed to read correctly. His failure to assess the element of water in his calculations/metaphisical formula was, in the end, tragic. Such is the fate of many of attempt \\"The Work\\" on totally on their own.<br /><br />It is tragic, not just pathetic as some reviwers claim.<br /><br />Maybe, unlike most of us who don't take risks for the sake of comfort & security, Nemo could have found his inner Self, his true Godhood.<br /><br />Maybe he could have really healed, but didn't.<br /><br />That's a tragedy for any broken soul.<br /><br />PS NOTES: Hal Holbrook is excellent as the bitter, sad old man who lost his family--and he regenerated via his relationship with Nemo. As matter of fact, the persons he managed to connect with, all benefited from the relationship. There was a great deal of good in him that went unrealized & unfulfilled<br /><br />The music in the film is really good & very appropriate to the scene they illuminate.<br /><br />At the films' conclusion, a photographic self-portrait of the man seems to indicate a man more troubled than at peace., a transcendental unity with One.

B000U0F7RG|1.0|Let me begin by saying this is a review of the product...NOT the show. The show is one of my all time favorites, I miss it and I wish it were still on.<br /><br />Anyway, I had purchased every season individually as they were released. Each season was in a very nice, well constructed box set and the design of them fit the show perfectly. I'm a person who appreciates a good product when I see it and I was happy to collect these.<br /><br />As a collector, I was VERY surprised and pretty disappointed to see this complete series set. I had every intention of buying it when it came out...glad I didn't. A friend bought it before I had the chance and I have never seen something so poor. The discs are in cardboard sleeves that promote scratching. The box itself is very flimsy and not very well put together. And who designed it? The design is WAY off and doesn't really go with the show. It's cheap and just all together weird. It all seems very much thrown together as an after thought. Clearly not much was put into this as all the pics and graphics look like they were done in someone's basement using photoshop and bad stock photos. I was expecting something SO much better. Especially for the price.<br /><br />Needless to say, I decided NOT to purchase it. I'll stick with my individual seasons. I would suggest others just buy them seperately as well. I was hoping for MUCH better treatment for one of my favorites.
B002VXKYCS|5.0|Streep is such a talented lady and Tucci is a great Mr. Child...I loved this movie
0316044938|1.0|I read this book because of the great reviews and also because I've seen previews for the movie and like to read the novel before seeing the film.<br /><br />After reading the first 12% (I have a Kindle) of the book, I still wasn't interested in the story and asked friends who have completed the novel if it's worth continuing, they all gave me rave reviews and so I went on.  Throughout the whole book I just couldn't wait for it to finally end, firstly because I don't like to start a book and not finish it, and also because I kept telling myself maybe it would get better.<br /><br />To me, this seems to be a case of the author trying way too hard to write an important novel.  There is just way too much detail about mundane things and too many sparkly descriptions that had me literally rolling my eyes at some points.  The book might have been better if it had been shortened by 1/3 by cutting out all of the filler and just getting on with the story.<br /><br />Not only was I annoyed most of the time while reading it, but the ending was completely frustrating and disappointing.  SPOILER: the murderer that readers are waiting for to be caught the whole book dies before he's found by authorities, and secondly Suzie is brought back to Earth temporarily in her friend Ruth's body (eye roll) and then she wastes her last precious hours back having sex with her childhood crush.  In my mind I was screaming at her to go see her family, or I don't know, at least tell the object of her affection that...well, her body is in a safe in the sink hole they were just at.<br /><br />I'm going to watch the movie tonight, and I hope that it's much better than the book like some other people are saying.  I can see how maybe this book is more meaningful for people who have lost somebody they are close to, personally (and thankfully, knock on wood) I've have yet to go through anything like that.
B002VECM6S|3.0|A huge and hugely inarticulate African American teen-ager from a broken family is adopted by a southern white couple, who help him become a football star and come out of his shell, and he winds up with a college scholarship.     Sounds heartwarming, inspiring, the kind that you want to get up and cheer at the end of, doesn't it? Well -- for me, anyway, the reality was a little different.     The young actor playing teen-ager Michael Oher, Quinton Aaron, may have only been playing the part the way he saw it -- but he seems to have as much acting ability as a huge block of coal. Tim McGraw as Sean Tuohy, the husband and father in the white family, spends a lot of his time doing whatever his wife tells him and marveling at how lucky he was to get her.     But it is Sandra Bullock, the wife Leigh Anne Tuohy, who really spoils this movie for me. With long, flowing blonde hair (dyed for the part), and a series of fanny-flattering straight skirts and tight slacks, she is certainly pleasing to look at -- until she opens her mouth. To put it mildly, her nickname could fittingly have been \\"Momma Sass.\\"     Momma orders her family around, tells football coaches how to do their job, does a \\"shamey-shamey\\" white guilt trip on her female friends when they suggest that having a young black man living with her family that includes a teen-age daughter might not be just the wisest thing to do, and is in general just too insufferably cocky and bumptious for my taste. She even talks trash to a group of black gang members in a public housing project where she has gone to look for the missing Michael -- and gets away with it. I'm amazed she was not shown doing a rap song she had improvised on the spot -- she can seemingly do everything else. The only person in the movie allowed to out-sass Momma and leave her without a snappy comeback is a fat, black female office manager at a license branch. Is anyone surprised?     Oher's scenes with the Tuohys' young son are mildly charming -- one ofthe few bright spots, in my estimation. But those bright spots are all too few.     Golden Globe for Bullock as best actress? OK -- that was their decision to make. To paraphrase something Harry Truman once said, \\"I didn't give it to her.\\" Way, way too much cocksureness -- and practically none of the blowback she would get from the people she's ordering around and smart-mouthing, if this was real life. I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them for a good movie. But please, Mr. Hancock (the director and screenwriter): Don't tinkle on my shoes, then tell me it's raining.

B00006JKON|4.0|I owned the original CD release of WarChild but I've been wanting to replace it because it, along with some other original CDs (Living in the Past, Under Wraps, etc.) had pops and clicks on some tracks.  The sound of this remastered CD is great and they've resolved the sound issues of the earlier releases.    One other reason I wanted to get the remaster is for the two bonus tracks, Rainbow Blues and Glory Row, which were originally included in the two Best-Of compilations from the 70's (M.U. and Repeat).  I owned M.U. and kept it for all these years just for Rainbow Blues, which is one of my favorite tracks.  I never ended up buying Repeat so I never got to hear Glory Row and I always hesitated to buy a whole CD for one track.  But when both tracks were included in the remastered WarChild it was a no-brainer.  I ditched my original M.U. and WarChild CDs and bought the remaster.  But I was very very disappointed to find out that the version of Rainbow Blues on the remaster is a remix which sounds very different than the original, and in my opinion, nowhere near as good.  The remix has boosted the levels of all the instruments to the same level and reduced the vocal level and buried it in echo; the result is a loud echo-ey mess.  The original version is very crisp and clean, with the vocals taking center stage and each instrument being distinct and separate, the drums being especially featured.  I disliked the new remix enough that I ended up buying the original track online from Amazon (I'd already given away my copy of M.U.).  I never heard the original version of Glory Row but I imagine they remixed that as well for the remaster.    The irony here is that the two original Best-Of albums did not contain the original versions of the hit songs, but remixes which were not as good as the originals!

0316154687|2.0|In \\"When You are Engulfed in Flames,\\" as well as in \\"Naked,\\" the first of David Sedaris's books I've read, I continually marveled how how he spun hilarity from the mundane. Although I laughed my socks off at bedtime reading two or three chapters an evening, I'd wake up the next day and not recall scarcely a thread.  Unlike reading Augusten Burrough's memoir, Magical Thinking, in which some of Burrough's stories will live with me forever. I absolutely love Hugh -- I want a friend just like him. He's the best sidekick for Sedaris.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about \\"When You are Engulfed in Flames\\" is that the entire section entitled, The Smoking Section, felt unequal, in terms of editing, humor, and enthusiasm, to the rest of the book.  It felt like Sedaris needed another 80 pages to complete a book-length collection, so he took his I'm Trying to Quit Smoking journal and clipped it the other manuscript pages and shipped the lot off to his publisher hoping they wouldn't notice it didn't quite work.  Other than that, it was an enjoyable (but not memorable) read.<br /><br />Marie Estorge<br />author of STORKBITES: A MEMOIR<br />and CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEEN<br />[...]

His father's dying words: \\"Don't be afraid.\\"<br /><br />Vowing vengeance, Bruce travels the world, learning all that he can to become a one-man army against crime. He leaves behind the life of a billionaire playboy and instead seeks to find the man rooted in pain and anger.<br /><br />Trained by a man named Ducard, a representative of Ra's Al Ghul, Bruce learns how to harness his rage and use it to exact vengeance on those, like the man who killed his parents, who would dare break the law.<br /><br />But to do so as Bruce Wayne would only put those he cares about in danger and would not be the symbol required to get the job done, and so is born . . . the Batman.<br /><br />Drugs are secretly being pumped into Gotham City's waterways, the underground crime circuit somehow connected to a mysterious figure overseas who has big plans for Gotham. No one knows his face . . . until it's too late.<br /><br />Jonathan Crane, aka the Scarecrow, uses his position in Arkham Asylum to get the inmates gathered for what's to come, and when the moment finally arrives, all hell breaks loose on Gotham's streets.<br /><br />The night grows dim, the knight grows dark.<br /><br />Batman is born.<br /><br />Wowser.<br /><br />This flick was amazing.<br /><br />After the disaster that was Batman & Robin, I was so scared about how this would turn out. Sure, the trailers looked cool, dark, and edgy, but studios always put the best bits in the trailers anyway. All we had were hopes and good-sounding quotes from those involved in the film's production.<br /><br />And, man, did they deliver!<br /><br />This stuff was real. Real-real. Batman Begins was grounded in reality in a way I hadn't seen since X-men. This stuff could really happen. It was that tone that brought a level of seriousness to the movie that the other bat-flicks--except Batman in 1989--didn't have. This wasn't a superhero movie, but a story about a man lost in rage, darkness and needing a way out. It was about the very real contrast between revenge and justice, and making right what once went so terribly wrong.<br /><br />It's a story about redemption, love, and fighting to protect strangers in a city where crime, filth and evil are the everyday norm.<br /><br />Christian Bale is Batman. Period. When the mask was on, you could tell Bruce was channeling pure rage and distaste for evil, focusing all that anger on the task before him. When the mask was off, he was the Bruce Wayne who was a spoiled rich boy, dumb, and no one took seriously. Excellent duality.<br /><br />Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend/love interest, Rachel Dawes, was a good thing. The other bat-movies always had a girlfriend for him. Though their was romantic interest here, it was rooted in friendship, which was a nice change.<br /><br />Michael Caine as Alfred--brilliant. He was your loving father-figure, yet was stern with Bruce when the need arose, and even got behind him when Bruce told him his grand plan for saving Gotham. Only the love of a friend would allow such a thing: to believe in an ideal and not necessarily the method.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was downright creepy as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. I only knew him from 28 Days Later so wasn't sure how he'd play this. Let's just say I was happy.<br /><br />Liam Neeson as Ducard/Ra's Al Ghul was all right. As Ducard, sure, made sense. He did a great job as Bruce's mentor. The two were the same at heart. Just chose different paths. As Ra's--that twist didn't surprise me (solely because I stumbled upon the script online before I saw the actual movie), but it did surprise me in the sense that Liam Neeson will always be Qui-Gon Jinn to me. It was hard to see him as a bad guy.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is James Gordon. He looked the part, acted the part, and I fully sympathized with him being pretty muchthe only good cop in a bad town.<br /><br />Batman Begins is the quintessential bat-film.<br /><br />Very recommended. Ten times over.

It was far more than a struggle between the Left and Right (Communists versus Capitalists in this case)as Orwell shows in this treasure of a book. My first surprise here was to learn that the Communists were the far right in this not so little soiree. Orwell goes into great detail to give the reader a grasp of the many factions involved in this war. The travails of the POUM Militia to which Orwll belonged and the events that led to it's purge anchor things nicely. His personal experiences in the trenches along with his observations on the conduct of the war and of the many people he meets are very interesting and should not be missed by any student of history. A great book that belongs on the bookshelf of all serious collectors of Spanish Civil War writings.
B0000009SF|5.0|When people label Zappa as 'jazz-fusion' this is one of the albums that is the reason for that. If you are looking for the acerbic witted lyrics or cuts that made The Mothers unique this isn't the album for you. If you are looking for an amazing and unique sound then you have come to the right place. I don't own a huge amount of Zappa but after listening to this album it has quickly risen in my estimation as one of his best. It clearly shows off Zappa's often talked about unique and gifted musical style but unlike many albums like \\"Sheik Yerbhouti\\" he doesn't let trying to be clever get in the way of the music. It's mostly instrumental and for me that's when Zappa shines.

Other than the music and the choreography, which were very good, the overall tone of the movie is very depressing. The ending of the film is the most disappointing part; everything is left unresolved. We can't imagine what motivated the judges to rank this the best picture of 1961, just two years after Ben-Hur was voted best picture of the year for 1959. We will be donating this movie to our local library.

B001QOGY9U|4.0|I have a nearly 4-year old son. Even though we are African American, I hadn't planned on taking him because he's a boy and it's about a princess. But at the recommendation of some friends that boys will like it too I took him to the matinee. Well, he didn't like it because it was too scary. I haven't seen a Disney film in decades, and I was actually quite surprised at the dark references and shadowy figures all throughout the film. The forces of good and evil are replete throughout the film, and I thought surely there must be some better way to get the point across than to put voodoo and dark references in a Disney princess film. I absolutely loved the beginning, with the scenes from Tiana's family and her wonderful father. It was actually quite realistic, that contrary to popular belief there are many good black men out there who are wonderful fathers like that. So I enjoyed the film, but it didn't do anything for my son except scare him. We'll be sticking with Thomas the Train, Sid the Science Kid, Dinosaur Train and the other great programming that comes on PBS. And the next time I take him to a movie I will read the reviews online before taking him. I just had no idea that voodoo and shadowy images would be part of a Disney film for kids!

The Lost Symbol is a fun ride from beginning to end, with plenty of plot twists.  I genuinely found this book hard to put down and i was left wanting more at the end.

B001IB4B3W|5.0|Dr. Seuss has it all.  Cadence.  Rhyming schemes. Silliness.  Creativity.  Originality.  His childlike views of his wacky worlds come with very real lessons that we never really know we are learning.  All are glorious fun to read but this one is especially fun to read aloud.<br /><br />The book is about sounds and making sounds and rhyming sounds and inventing sounds.  All wrapped up in Seussian rhyming schemes and a degree of cleverness which is just so, well, simple.  Seeing eyes light up at the various \\"buzzes\\", \\"clicks\\" and \\"pips\\" is a delight.  Then comes the murmer as the child or children begin to imitate the sounds themselves until there's only one sound- laughter.<br /><br />This book engages both reader and read to with a bond neither is likely to forget.  Though one of Dr. Seuss's lesser known, it becomes one of his best loved.  You'll see. . . (or in this case, hear.)

B002VPE1AW|5.0|I have seen Avatar twice now.  The first time I was so overwhelmed I couldn't stop thinking about it for two days.  The second time was equally wonderful and I was able to absorb more of it (by the way it's perfectly wonderful in 2D - 3D added very little to the experience).  This film conveys the beauty of the natural world, and the need to protect it, better then any speech or scientific data.  There was a time when the Earth was like this - beautiful and dangerous and naturally sustainable.  Human beings in their desire to survive and create more security have worked hard to change the world and we have succeeded.  The cost has been great though and it is finally becoming clear that we have gone too far.  Avatar reminds us that there is something greater then short term need and greed, and if we don't recover a vision of a sustainable world our own survivability is in jeopardy.  Some viewers find the conflict in Avatar unnecessary and cliche, but I feel it's just holding up a mirror and reflecting what is happening in our world.  As we speak the Amazon rain-forest is being cut down because of the need for more grazing land for the beef industry.  The ice caps are melting, the coral reefs are threatened - it goes on and on.  We cannot go back to the hunter/gatherer stage, but we can go forward and use our science and technology to reduce the human footprint.  I can image a sustainable modern world but it will take time and sacrifice, especially from 1st world peoples who have come to take for granted that energy is unlimited.  The biggest obstacle is the denial that persists and I fear that the environmental impacts will have to get worse and cause more direct suffering before we will get serious.      Avatar filled me with wonder and broke my heart, and I am grateful.    Edit:  I feel the critical comparisons to other films are invalid.  All stories contains elements of other stories.  If this was a problem 99.9% of all films, books, etc, would have to go away.To the contrary the artful retelling of stories makes them richer.  That said if you wish to compare Avatar with another film have a look at Emerald Forest.
B001RTP48G|5.0|This has to be the absolute best album by one of the very best musical acts of all time. Tracks 1, 2, and 4 in particular stand out, but the entire album is very worthy and a listening pleasure. Surely more must be done to promote the music of the Pet Shop Boys; they are far too great to be enjoyed by a privileged few.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is very educational and entertaining.  It illustrated the truth about food production in America and I plan to show this video to many of my friends and family!  I HIGHLY recommend it!
B000QUEHOO|5.0|Diamond does an excellent job of describing some compelling theories regarding the decline and extinction of past human societies.  Diamond digs through history and evidence to come to the consistent theme for all societies that have vanished - overpopulation.  It is a problem we see playing out today in many poor countries (Haiti, many African nations, etc).  Yet it is the third-rail, the elephant in the room, the topic we dare not speak about because it brings to mind taboo subjects such as the communist regime in China.  The reality is that unless we control the world's population, there will a time in the very near future when we simply cannot provide for all of the world's population.  The Earth is made up of finite resources and humans, like a cancer, are eating away at the very basic resources that make our planet what it is.  In an era where longevity in the modern world is commonplace, rather than the anomaly that it was just 100 years ago, we are quickly laying the groundwork for our own extinction.  This is a theme that Diamond makes throughout the book and does so quite well.  Using examples from past civilizations (the Mayans, Easter Island, etc), Diamond puts the puzzle pieces together to explain exactly how overpopulation and the decimation of natural resources caused these populations to basically go extinct.  I wish every high school made this book required reading, because it definitely changed the way I think about society, our resources, and how human society should work.  If more people read this book, we might be able to save the Earth from the looming disaster that is beginning to look inevitable.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This movie is by far one of the greatest, and most touching films I've ever had the privilege to see. The storyline and character developement was perfect, the Hmong cast did very well despite their lack of prior experience, and the bitter-sweet ending so amazing that it actually brought a tear to my eyes. Anyone who gives this film a negative review is usually full of themselves, too PC, or just doesn't understand the film alltogether. And again, a lot of you need to consider that most (if not all) of the Hmong cast had NO prior acting experience. So think about that before making such harsh judgements about them.
0385737947|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read! It's full of adventure and mystery. It is suspenful all the way through. It kept me on edge. The characters are realistic, you'll love some and hate others. Please visit my websit dedicate to this amazing book by James dashner: [...]!
0553573411|5.0|Many people criticize this book, but I can't quite understand why. To me it's like Assassin's Apprentice, but better (and longer). I found the first 10-15 pages to be a bit rocky, but it improves as we follow Fitz's life at Buckkeep, dealing with the numerous problems resulting from the Red Ship raids, Regal's ambition, and his own struggles to grow up and develop relationships. I liked this one better because Fitz is older; he's no longer in training, he's a teenager as opposed to a young boy, and he's able to take more independent action.<br /><br />And stuff happens. Fitz goes into battle. He gets a girlfriend. He becomes a player in the intrigues of Buckkeep, as opposed to the pawn he was before. No, this isn't nonstop action-based fantasy by any means, with its focus on character development and Fitz's daily life, but if you read and enjoyed Assassin's Apprentice, you probably like that. And much like the previous book, this one will draw you in, get you emotionally involved, and not let you go. The only downside is that the end is so depressing that you virtually have to move on to the third book to see how things turn out (and I thought the third book was awful).<br /><br />At any rate, I found this to be a highly engrossing book, and I hope people won't be discouraged after reading Assassin's Apprentice by the criticism of this one.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Ehhhhh...i'll go ahead and throw this one five stars.  I think a lot of the naysayers on this movie worked too hard at watching it.  One thing it has going for it is that it is honest in what it is trying to present. No hidden agendas, messages, misdirection, bait-and-switch jobs on the audience, or whatever.  What you see in the first five minutes is what you get-or better-for the rest of the movie.    One thing that is a major factor in my decision to buy movies for my collection is its capacity for repeated viewing.  DUH.  Why buy a movie to watch it only once?  Yet, I think many people don't consider something this simple.  If you know where a movie is going, what is going to happen, even why, then there is some other reason for watching it over and over:  casting, production, script, scenery, dialogue, humor, etc., things you enjoy seeing again because you know they will be there.    This movie has plenty of that.  I personally love all the art deco imagery, the classic film-noir atmosphere at the beginning, the allusions to other period box-office legends, easter eggs like the Wizard of Oz cameo, that beautiful P-40 Warhawk tearing up the skies, and the stormy, sarcastic, he said-she said relationship of the principal characters.  It is just a fun movie, presented in a unique, whimsical wrap of throwback cinematography paying homage to the old serial adventures and WWII-era movie making.  So there is a Brit flying a P-40 in a continental American context.  so what.  adds character.  Gwyneth Paltrow looks like she finally stepped back into an era where she truly belongs.  She simply looks like a 30's-40's movie star.    Another appeal of this movie is something that is too rarely seen these days:  production by a group of novice, unexperienced visionaries.  this becomes most evident from watching the special features - AFTER you see the film itself.  These people pursued this vision untainted and without preconditions of having worked in the movie industry before.  The honesty of this spectacle is all the more vivid and astonishing, and truly adds to the enjoyment of this truly one-of-a-kind film epic.  Go ahead and add this true original to your collection.  If Conran doesn't make anything else, he deserves to be remembered fondly for this effort.
B0015DROBO|4.0|First of all, I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I struggled at times because I was unfamiliar with the Swedish place names; and many of the character names were so similar that I had to keep a running list to distinguish them.  But the story is AMAZING.  After I looked up some bio info about Larsson, I understood the story more.  I recommend that readers check him out as well.  The other reviews here describe the story, so I'm sticking to the \\"why\\" you should read it.  It's a tale with corners, closets, twists, and turns.  And the character development for Lisbeth and Blomkvist makes them \\"real.\\"  This novel and the next (The Girl Who Played with Fire) are excellent reads for people who enjoy getting to know the characters and taking a fascinating ride along with them.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|Jimmy Page and the Edge are my favorite guitar players ever. When I heard there was going to be a documentary about them I was excited. However, seeing the same old historical photos and performances from both isn't what I wanted. The focus should have been on them playing songs together, everything else just got in the way. Especially Jack whatever his name is. He was simply not on their level, just because he likes to experiment with making guitars doesn't make him that interesting or relevant. Not sure who would have been a good substitute, Eddie Van Halen or the late Stevie Ray Vaughn. But this movie went for a generational angle, but I didn't buy it. Not worth the hype.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great Movie, excellant resolution.  Marjorie Reynolds is beautiful and was a very talented actress.  Most people probably remember her as William Bendix's wife in \\"The Life of Riley\\" on television in the 50's and 60's when her hair was brunette and she was older, of course.  The music is wonderful, especially \\"White Christmas\\" which was heard for the first time in this movie and was thought that it would not become the hit it did.    Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire were at their usual best.  I would highly recommend this film for purchase for anyone's dvd library of great movies. The other members of the cast were fun to watch too.    If you have never seen this movie, you have missed seeing one of the best.  Although it is in black and white it still is a beautiful film.    I had seen parts of it in the past on television, but never in its entirety until I purchased it here at Amazon.com.  I am, certainly, happy I bought it and was able to see it in its complete form.    Although I love the color movie \\"White Christmas\\" from 1954 and saw it, originally, at the movie theater, starring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera Ellen, and it is one of my all time favorites, \\"Holiday Inn\\" was as enjoyable for me to see and have for my collection (and I am Jewish).    Buy it and you won't be sorry.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Pixar as of late seems like it can do no wrong with some of the best and most original films of recent years. Up fit that mold perfectly. It centers on a cranky elderly man named Carl whose intent on fulfilling a dream of his late wife of taking a trip to an exotic place in South America. Unintentionally a wide eyed kid, Russell, tags along, and Carl has no choice but to deal with the annoyance.     In truly unique Pixar fashion they make the totally impossible believable, like that a house could fly with helium filled balloons, or that a device could be made to allow dogs to speak. There are wonderfully funny and inventive things abound. But it's the compelling characters and heartfelt story are really what makes it so great. There's a five minute montage at the beginning that, without the use of dialog, encapsulates the life of a married couple, and it's truly a most brilliant accomplishment. That sets the tone for the rest of the film, and while it doesn't end quite as strong as it starts it never losers its heart and sense of wonder.     Ratatouille was one of my favorite films of 2007, Wall-E one of my tops from 2008, and now Up ranks easily as one of 2009's best films. I love Pixar.    The special features in the four disk set leave some to be desired. I'm not sure why Disney can't do commentaries for these Pixar masterpieces. The blu-ray extra disk in the four disk set basically includes only a short making of documentary and a few other small things. Nevertheless, the four disk set is definitely the one to get. Even if you don't have a blu-ray player the DVD version is also included, and once you do go blu-ray you won't have to buy the movie again to watch it that way. The digital copy is also included which I gave my mom because I personally don't care about watching movies on my computer.
B002FOQXZK|4.0|Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon is a bit of a repackage/ new cd. Some songs have carried over or were released as singles to test the market, a practice that cliches what an artist is viewed as but in this case not a bad thing.     Kid Cudi is what hip hop should be IMHO, creatively lyrical yet his message is one of fun, redemption, working through adversity, and struggle rather than how many cars you have, how many girls you took home, or how much coke you slang ... although in this case an avid pothead is not a bad thing ...     listen to this cd with an open mind and listen for the lyrics that make sense to you, not trying to find something to sing along to in the club
B002XTBEDI|5.0|Some people have mentioned that this one is not as good as the first, and I agree that it is not quite as good... Yet this still has such a great charm and is so enjoyable.  And Judi Dench is brilliant as always.  Even if you don't enjoy it as much as the first, if you liked the first at all, I would be very surprised if you didn't find a whole lot to love about this one, too.  I certainly loved it, and be sure you make it all the way to the end, as it gives you one of those \\"Feel Good\\" endings that makes you happy you took the time to see it.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Beautiful music! Only wish that EVERY song from the DVD had made it to the CD. : (  ...How about a 2nd try with a two cd set that includes ALL the songs?
B000B8QG4A|5.0|My movie was delivered quite fast and in excellent condition. My grandchildren enjoyed the movie and I am pleasantly surprised with the extras the 2nd cd has on it. This is a plus since I would have been happy with just the movie.
B00005JPMZ|3.0|Imagi Entertainment's first full-length CGI animated movie before the recent Astro Boy film was this sequal to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles live-action movie trilogy from the 90s. Despite what alot of people thought, the Critic included, this was not a followup to the 80s animated series, the 2000s animated series, or the abomination known as The Next Mutation.<br /><br />Taking place a few years after the third movie, the Turtles have gone estranged. Leonardo left to go on a training mission to Central America. April O'Neil is now into trading relics, and while in Central America tracks down Leo, and lets him know how the other brothers are doing. Donatello and Michaelangelo each have secret part-time jobs to make ends meet. Raphael is doubling as a masked vigilante called Nightwatcher. Leo decides to finally return to New York. While this is going on, the Foot Clan is being lead Karai in the wake of Shredder's apparent death who are now working for the rich CEO, Max Winters. Winters is really an immortal ex-warrior king who three millenia ago opened a door to another dimension that unleashed thirteen monsters into our world. Winters is now trying to collect the monsters who are converging on New York, supposedly because the portal is going to reopen, although it threatens to release an endless army of monsters too. To help him, Winters collects the statue-fied remains of his former war buddies, and brings them to life as living stone. After getting involved in a fight with the Foot's attempt to capture one of the monsters, Leo grows tired of Raphael's stubborness to listen to his orders. He later finds out about Raphael's superheroing, and they have it out in a fight that's been building for a long time now(ask anyone whose read the original comics!). Leo gets captured by the Winters' stoneboys who want to fake him out as the last of the monsters so that they can keep their immortality. Raph gets Splinter, April, Casey Jones, and the other Turtles to raid Winters' tower while they are opening the vortex. The stone soldiers betray Winters as the Turtles and the Foot team up to stop them. They conveniently manage to find the last monster and send it into the vortex with the others. The Foot leaves promising a possible sequal, and Winters then disappears into pixie dust, while the Turtles decide to continue their crimefighting careers.<br /><br />This was a good upgrade from the live-action movies, and most of the other adaptions of the comic, but it still carried the storyline from the original movies pretty well. The animation is most impressive, and the backgrounds and character designs are very articulate. I thought the movie was a great extension of the Turtles mythos, even though it might be a little unappealing to non-shellheadswer while they are opening the vortex.

3552060413|5.0|This book has fascinated me from the first moment I started reading to the last - and it did not take long - actually, it was over too fast. What a story, how captivating, how emotional, how well written! The language is incredible the choice of words / phrases to want to be able to write like this. I already passed it on to a friend and announced it to other friends thereafter. I cannot wait to read the sequel \\"Alle sieben Wellen\\"... and it has nothing to do with sailing or boating or swimming...  I wished it were written in English so more of my friends could read it...
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|i dont like lady gaga weird name stupid music and retarded outfits she should be locked up bc she crazy.
B000002KBU|5.0|I highly recommend this album for its sincerity, compassion, melodic jumps with ease, and utter beauty.  The best example of the control and power she has over her voice comes during 2:20 - 2:25 in her wonderful song, \\"California.\\" Her album will free you from the blues, and make you want to turn up the volume.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|My wife and I really enjoy the first Cranford film/series.  It is truly excellent in pretty much every way.  Unfortunately, this effort is not nearly on par with the first.  The script, character development, story-telling, and pacing are lacking.  I think the film is still entertaining enough to be worth watching as long as you enter with lowered expectations.  In particular the actors do their best with what they are given.  The performances of Imelda Staunton and Judi Dench are worth seeing.  Other than that, where the original used the characters to good effect, this new series almost universally wastes them.    Others have commented that the first part wasn't great.  It may not have been great, but still left the door open for a promising conclusion.  The second part is borderline not good and is the undoing of the film.    Suggested Alternative Title:    It pains me, but I can't give my suggested alternative title as it might constitute a spoiler.  Suffice it to say it's dripping with metaphorical irony.  For more, see the comments on my review.
0060555661|5.0|A great introduction and education in investing. It doesn't guarantee to make you rich, but by reading it you should avoid becoming poorer. I have read other books and it probably should still be considered the bible of investing.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD is so wonderful.  The songs chosen capture the elegance of her voice.  Her rendition of Silent Night is how every Christmas song should be sung.  I am hoping that she will have a holiday CD in 2010.
B002QYSZBO|5.0|Violent, sarcastic and very, very funny!  The cast was great, the story line was great and there's a mystery to solve too!  How can you beat that ?
B001RPD06I|4.0|Please note that these larger-capacity cards are SDHC, not the older style SD.  This means that not every device or reader can use it properly. Make sure your device or you card reader can read SDHC. If it doesn't say so explicitly, it probably only supports SD. Read the manual.    I am using mine in a Samsung Rogue phone to hold my music collection, where it works great. However, the card reader slot in my older Dell monitor only supports SD cards, so it can't read/write to the card properly. I had to put the card in the phone and use the phone's \\"mass storage\\" menu setting and a USB cable to load the card up with music.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie made me laugh until I cried.  It's really zany, stupid humor.  Not like Dumb and Dumber but absurd, mixed up stuff.  Maybe more like, A Fish Called Wanda.  This is my kind of humor, even though I had to turn the English captions on the first few times I watched it.  I'm not good with British accents.  A friend of mine once told me that the British find death really funny.  Don't know if that's true, but this movie kind of supports that idea.  Of course, part of the hilarity is that it all happens during a very serious event, a funeral, when you're not supposed to be laughing.  Even though it deals with death, it's not macabre.  I saw the ad for an American version coming out with a largely African American cast.  Don't think the American version will be able to pull it off as well, but I'll probably check that one out, too.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is a great Christmas movie. If you are getting a little tired of White Christmas or the more traditional holiday films, give this one a chance. Hugh Grant is brilliant and the rest of the all-star cast will really make you laugh, especially rock star Billy Mac. Try it, you'll like it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I loved it.  It is a beautiful cd to relax too.  The Lord, Susan Boyle and I tiled my kitchen backsplash over the weekend together.  Songs I remember my Mama singing when I was a child.  I am going to purchase another for my Mother.   In this too fast, hectic world I simply enjoyed the peacefulness of it.  Thank you Susan for slowing things down and filling my heart and mind with great memories.  I found myself breaking out and singing at the top of my lungs.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|5 stars for the movie, 4 for the blu-ray version. The video transfer is not very good. Looks fairly close to the dvd version. If you have a good tv, you can tweak it to look better.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|a great novel, it has harnassed learning mythology and heroes into a fantasy chapter series book. excellent
B00280LYIC|5.0|First off... great book. HIGHLY recomemnded.    Second, I love J K Rowling and all that stuff... but can people stop comparing books to Harry Potter? Authors have the right to be credited for their work... not compared.     But yes. I love this book. Constantly recommend it. GO PERCY!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|A brilliant recreation of the Star Trek origins comes alive in this Blu-ray copy.<br /><br />The sound carried over by Blu-ray is particularly important because this new Star Trek movie is filled with musical scores that make the movie come alive.  You really feel the drama because of the music.<br /><br />The clarity of Blu-ray makes it that much better.  How could you not want to see the bridge of the Enterprise in full 1080P?<br /><br />When I purchased this Blu-ray, it was $19.99.  For that price, you're almost compelled to get it over the DVD copy!
0060254920|5.0|I never read this book as a child, and was always told that I was deprived.I finally buckled down and read it.<br /><br />I only wish that my parents had bought me this book as a child. I can only imagine where my imagination would have taken me with story like this. My heart was warmed by the sheer innocence of Max and how he could imagine his room as forest and escape to it. I wish that I would have experienced this book as a child, because I was definitely the child that imagined herself as a princess in a far away land.<br /><br />The illustrations are too good for words. They can express so many different events in each one. I love how as long as Max imagined it to happen, it happened.<br /><br />I am so glad that I got to experience this book as an adult and I will make sure that it will onmy child's bookshelf for when he/she learns to read, needs a way to escape :-)
031606792X|3.0|I am an older reader of the Twilight series and the first three books reminded of books I read as a teenager. I enjoyed the storylines and the characters that the author created. I was excited to see how it all ended. When I started reading it I too was perplexed by the lack of a honeymoon night between Edward and Bella and then the pregnacy happened and I was like \\"okay lets see where this goes...\\" I didn't have a problem with her being pregnant though it seemed kind of weird but I was concerned that once the baby arrived and if it was a girl that Jacob was going imprint on it. I but held out hope that he would not. Lo and behold he imprinted on her. I was so disappointed that I had to put the book away for a bit. I felt it was such a cop out for and a horrible development for Jacob who is such a likable character and probably the most \\"normal\\" character in the series. I did finish reading and was so disapponted in the whole book and the developments that I did not enjoy it and rst of my read was under protest.     Well in December I decided to read it again. I knew the plot and what was going to happen but I wanted to see if I could make sense out it and possibly enjoy it. I found the second read through to actually be better. I could understand why Bella's transformation was easy. As Carlise said she was prepared and she had an intense love for her family and friends and that helped too. it would have been nice for her to have a slip up though. Nobody is perfect. I could see her love for the baby. Yes she never thought of being a mother but instinct plays a role in your feelings for your child. I still totally hated that Jacob imprinted on the child. Jacob could have felt love for the baby and wanted to protect it because it was Bellas but Stephanie made it way to easy for everyone. It would have been better for him to not have imprinted or I was hoping he and Leah would end up together. I really liked Leah and she would have made a great match for him.     Yes Ithought the story wrapped up too neatly. There is no way a dad like Charlie would just accept not seeing his daughter for so long. Maybe he would eventually come around being that he is friends with the tribe and came to understand the legends but do you think he would let so much time go by without trying to see or speak to Bella? The final \\"battle\\" should have ended in sacrifice. It was too simple for Bella to become the \\"hero\\". We should have had some kind of confrontation. Jk Rowling was not afraid to show that in battles there are casualties as she did in her final Harry Potter book. It makes you appreciate what you have that much more.     Overall it was a cute neatly wrapped story. It read more like a fan-fiction to me. I am with the rest that say Eclipse should have been the last book. If you like neat clean endings then this will work for you.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|The title borrows, of course, from a then disoriented Mr. Haskell. And while I still tend to lay responsibility for 'Lizard' at the 100 feet of Centipede, it's a record that in its profound eccentricity helped introduce me to many and equally worthwhile recordings of that day, not least of which were 'Septober Energy\\", \\"Blueprint\\", \\"Ovary Lodge\\" and maybe even \\"It Is and It Isn't\\". It's difficult to understate this importance: that the influence of a somewhat \\"popular\\" band like King Crimson can make the stylistic points which lead any interested or engaged listener away from the already recognized to the frankly mostly unrecognized -- and to all the many rewards accruing thereto.<br /><br />But despite the dazzling technological revisionism, which, like the obsessive and typo-ridden box set (does no one proofread liner notes any longer?) built around 'In The Court Of The Crimson King', and the aptly named 'Red', Fripp is again exhibiting Ancient Egyptian-like levels of preservationist zeal. (As an aside only: as dazzling as the audio work proves to be, the reproduction of one of KC's most lush and detailed pieces of cover art is actually unacceptably poor.)<br /><br />Beautiful and unclassifiable, hobbled and racing, awkward and overflowing with elegance, the music of 'Lizard' remains an inextricable product of its time -- what it might possibly mean to Generation Thumbs will wait to be seen. Forty years on, my stereo is better. I can, if I wish, Surround Myself With Sound (or just step outside). Expectations for sonic reproduction are, at best, subjectively different, at least, objectively better. The societal, cultural, economic and political milieus still mostly suck. I am myself changed by the intervening decades, the synapses are set and memory, not discovery, now shapes the better part of preference. So 'Lizard\\", after countless transmutations of recording technology, is still and always a fine album to my ears. That it now sounds better in many ways is an improvement, but an improvement that does not, in the end, add to my appreciation, respect and memory like any and every other part of life that is awaited, that finally arrives, that adds some measure to comprehension and understanding, and that recedes to become yet another smooth or jagged part of experience. Embalming, while no longer necessary in these declining and ascending days, is appreciated none-the-less.an improvement that does not, in the end, add to my appreciation, respect and memory like any and every other part of life that is awaited, that finally arrives, that adds some measure to comprehension and understanding, and that recedes to become yet another smooth or jagged part of experience.

B002CAWNEM|4.0|This film has been so unfairly trashed-yes, it's cliched but the acting made up for some of its shortcomings, plus it's not really a Fatal Attraction re-make either. Ali Larter has certainly matured since Final Destination-meaning she isn't doing teenage roles anymore. Her obsession with Derek is convincing even though she's clearly a nutcase.  Beyonce does a nice job as the wife you don't want to cross, even if unintentional. Let's just say, Ali learns this the hard way, trust me. Jerry O'Connell doesn't have much to do, but every scene he has, he steals!  The biggest shock for me was the rating of PG-13, but I need to remember the rating system has lightened up alot, in some ways, not for the better, I've seen a few rated that,and they should've been R, this one however, I don't think pushes the envelope that much, I think my old nurse friend may take some things a little too seriously, this movie has alot of humor on top of the drama.
0812973992|3.0|I'm a Colum McCann fan and have read \\"The Other Side of Brightness\\", \\"Zoli\\", and \\"Dancer\\".    I was eager to read \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" and delighted to find the opening chapter following a tightrope walker about to begin his walk. I also enjoy inter-connected stories that shape a whole, such as those written by Amy Tan and Barbara Kingsolver. However, the voices in these novels, while varied, must be absolutely credible or the story drops.    While the chapters told from the elder Corrigan's point of view are extremely effective, other chapters aren't. The most telling example, for me, is Tillie's voice which is not only unconvincing but somehow veers toward stereotype. This essentially reduce the credibility of the character and breaks the tension that is created so effortlessly in other parts of the book.    I should have been with the tight-rope walker on the wire, running into the arms of the police officer. I should have identified all the other tightrope walkers who have wandered in and out of the story and are meant to tie the story into a complete whole. Instead I was left wondering about the gaps that these weaker sections left.    Colum McCann is a gifted and mesmerizing author. I just don't think his authorial magic worked with this book.
B002VECLVO|5.0|You will come to love George and worry about what happens to him. Colin Firth makes George absolutely real. Goode, Moore, and Hoult are fantastic too. I cannot remember when I have enjoyed a movie more. A must see, as must own. (The book is compelling too.)
0736063684|5.0|I happened to see this book at a local store one day while browsing; since I lift weights, I thought it would be interesting.  This book excels in two areas:  showing which particular muscles are used in certain exercises and getting as detailed anatomically as possible.  A person who would like this book would be a person who would say, what is the difference between doing preacher curls or dumbbell curls, and when doing dumbbell curls, why does it matter if I turn my wrists at the top or not at all?  I consult this book frequently for questoins about form and new exercise tips.
B000059TCE|5.0|If you love animals (dogs, horses, pigs, lambs, racoons, rabbits, birds, whatever) you will LOVE this movie.  Period.  No doubt about it.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|this is such a funny and cute movie. my son and i rented it, and it only took about 10 minutes to see that i was going to have to buy it for both of us to watch again and again. my grandparents went to see it at the theater when it first came out and couldn't stop talking about how great it was. so that shows that its good for ALL ages :)
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Some people just don't get certain humor and subtleties in life and in movies, so there will always be detractors, and hence some of the few negative reviews of this film.  Incredible performance by Waltz as Hans Landa, while the character played by Brad Pitt is more of a satire than anything, and that's what makes it amusing.  You have to relate to The Bear Jew from Boston to appreciate the character.  Even Hitler is amusing in this thing, and the acting is tremendous.   This film manages to bring together all the seriousness of WWII, while adding in mystery, amusement, and comedy all the while.  This film is a MUST SEE for all Tarantino fans.  \\"IT'S A BINGO!!\\"  I can't imagine how anyone could be negative on this film, especially with all the garbage that comes out of Hollywood these days.  The plot is clever.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|a great feel-good Christmas movie. our entire family loves it and we had it dvr'd but somehow it got erased. so i had to buy it to have on hand at our house.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I purchased after market \\"just as good\\" batteries to replace aging Canon batteries that were 3 years old at the time.  Now the original equipment Canon batteries that are over 4  years old are still running strong and have outlasted the after market batteries from a variety of vendors. Running a test with my Canon 20D camera by selecting \\"auto run\\" in slide show, the 4 year old original equipment batteries run 4 to 5 hours and the after market batteries run 1 to 3 hours after just one year of use. ( one after market battery is completely dead  )    The old adage  \\" you get what you pay for \\" really hold true for rechargeable Canon batteries.  I will only purchase Canon Batteries for my Canon camera from now on.  Save money in the long run.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This beautiful film worked in so many ways that I hardly know where to begin.  First, and most basically, it was visually lovely.  Each scene was composed with such care, the costuming was perfect, and the nature shots breathtaking.  Second, the performances were perfect.  Third, the story itself was so incredibly touching that I was astounded.  At various times I laughed, then I cried so hard!  Tears were running down the cheeks of everyone in my family as we watched.  Unabashed, and perfect, katharsis.<br /><br />  This is the story of a young man who dreams of playing the cello in an orchestra, but when he loses his job, he and his wife go back to where he grew up (he was left a building and their expenses will be less).  There he looks for a job.  There is a misprint in the paper, and he thinks he is interviewing for some sort of travel agent (departures), but it is, instead, working with the \\"departed.\\"  As we watch this film, we see him and his wife grow in wisdom, and we see beautifully constructed scenes of families dealing with the worst that can happen.<br /><br />  I recommend this film to anyone who 1) loves film in general, and 2) loves films that touch those parts of the soul that we rarely want to look at -- those that harbor grief, regret, nostalgia.  How memorable are the performances?  I'll never forget them!  I noticed, too, that the gentleman who runs the \\"departures\\" business is the same actor who was in Tampopo!  I couldn't believe that I recognized him after 25 years!  His performances are that good!<br /><br />  This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|I liked the movie, but I guess I was a little over hyped for it and it didn't quite meet my expectations. It was slow in points and not as much action as I expected.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" follows the quietly exploits of an unlikely hero.      Georg Dreyman is a brilliant writer, and intelligent enough to think for himself in a regime that prizes the appearance of such qualities, but moves to suppress it nonetheless.  But Dreyman is not the hero of this tale.      Hauptman Gerd Weisler is both an enforcer for the GDR's notorious secret police - \\"The Stasi\\" - and a dedicated believer in the state.  Luckily for Dreyman, Weisler proves to be one of the few true believers left alive in the GDR.  A genius in the art of interrogation, Weisler is fixed for a career above those relegated (virtually imprisoned) in a cellar steam-opening envelopes.  When Weisler receives orders to surveille the author, he finds little of concern - the brilliant Dreyman proves no threat to the sanctity of the regime.  Instead, Weisler learns that his superiors' interests in the playright stem from less-than purely socialist motives.  Walking a tightrope, Weisler his own venal bosses to protect the playright without revealing his role.    \\"Others\\" is such a brilliant and understated film for several reasons.  Weisler becomes a hero, while preserving his outward appearance as an arm of the dreaded Stasi.  Even late in the film, in a scene where he interrogates Dreyman's actress lover, you never lose sense of the unimaginable pressure and terror he exerts on his \\"victims\\".  Most stories reserve the glory for the beautiful, the epic and the undeniably valorous - but \\"Others\\" reveals the heroic role that even the ugly, the hated and the craven must thanklessly play in the battle for freedom.

0312370849|1.0|I have to say I was pulled in at the beginning wanting to know what happened to Sarah and her family but after getting to the middle of the book and finding out what happens I totally did not want to read it any longer. I lost interest.  I dont care about the editor and what she is going through that wasnt what the book was supposed to be about.  You never really find out anything about sarah's life afterwards.  To me this book should not even come close to Amazon's top 100 books.  I wish I could get my money back.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I received these triggers about a week ago and I absolutely love them.  I agree with the reviews that state that the PS3 controller should have been designed this way in the first place.  I am a \\"big guy\\" with \\"big hands\\" and do not have any of the problems with this item pinching my fingers or accidental button pressing that others have complained about.  I will admit that one of the triggers did come off one time, but only because I dropped my controller.  This is a great item and I have already ordered another set to give as a gift.

0756655307|3.0|I purchased this for my comic book obsessed husband to share with our son.  I had considered buying the more expensive collectors edition, however after reading the reviews, I didn't feel that it warranted the additional cost.  As predicted, my husband was thrilled with the book, but simply browsing through it, he began to find discrepancies.  This book is a great gift for anyone interested in Marvel superheros and villains, but the true comic book connoisseur will easily find errors.  It's a shame that even with creator collaboration, they still couldn't get it right.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was 13 when The Beatles hit Ed Sullivan.  I was 19 when \\"Abbey Road\\" came out.  The Beatles truly did track my teen years.  We first listened to their music over tinny AM radioes and scratchy mono 45s.  It was just plain joyful great music.  It still is.   Younger folks now have the chance to start at \\"Love Me Do\\" and finish with \\"Her Majesty.\\"  It's the trip of a lifetime well worth taking, and the \\"cleaner\\" recordings make that trip even more glowing.  Don't listen to the audiophile complaints.  You'll just get stuck in a decision loop.  Buy these CDs (for the best price you can) and enjoy.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|This is the first time that I've bought an album in a long time that I've liked the majority of the songs.  I love the mellow rap style and the chorus. His beats are some of the best. To buy this at $5 is a steal, definitely go for it.  The only tracks I don't like are In My Dreams, Simple As, Solo Dolo, Enter Galactic, Hyerr, Up Up and Away    The rest are instant classics. I can't stop listening to them.
0385523904|5.0|Journalist Barbara Demick, based in Seoul, spent seven years interviewing defectors from North Korea. Talking with people who have escaped from North Korea is just about the only way we have of finding out what life is like for people inside the Hermit Kingdom. Foreign travelers to North Korea are heavily supervised and there's no chatting with the locals. Little communication is allowed between North Korea and the rest of the world. What limited access there is to the internet is strictly controlled.<br /><br />But in South Korea, Demick had access to as many North Korean defectors as she wanted to interview. She decided to focus on those from a town distant from the show capital of Pyongyang. The port town of Chongjin is far enough from the capital to be more representative of North Korea. Foreign visitors never find their way to Chongjin, but the town is the third largest in North Korea. The population may be around 300,000 or possibly closer to a million. Even facts as basic as this are impossible to nail down in the world of slippery North Korean propaganda.<br /><br />The book is further narrowed down to just six former residents: a pediatrician, a middle-aged widow and her rebellious daughter, a university student, an orphan, and a primary school teacher. Most of the book describes their lives - their family histories, their childhoods, how they coped with the changing conditions in North Korea. In describing their lives, we learn what everyday life is like for North Koreans.<br /><br />The most interesting part by far is finding out how they came to make the decision to defect. Most of the people profiled in Nothing to Envy were evidently good citizens, and had no reason to doubt the (to us) obvious propaganda. With no access to the rest of the world, even through TV or radio, North Koreans believe the government that tells them that North Korea is superior to all other countries and that \\"We have nothing to envy in the world,\\" according to a song all toddlers learn in school. But in each of the profiled lives, there was a moment when they no longer believed.<br /><br />Although the book is subtitled \\"Ordinary Lives in North Korea,\\" the people profiled in Nothing to Envy, are by definition not ordinary at all. They decided to defect, and this made them far from ordinary. Leaving their homes and families, at great risk to themselves and those they left behind, was not an easy decision. Once the decision had been made, following through and making it to China or South Korea or beyond was another amazing feat. Demick remarks on this late in the book, noting that defectors are, for the most part, people who didn't fit in in North Korea, and often have a hard time fitting in in their new country. Demick's point is an important one and reminds us that these stories are impossible to verify and that we'll only know the truth when North Korea is open.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy reminds me of another excellent book from several years ago, [[ASIN:1862075808 Stasiland: True Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall]] by Anna Funder. In post-Wall Berlin, Funder interviews former East Germans and finds that the secret police (\\"Stasi\\") were an unavoidable part of everyone's life. No one could be trusted. It was Orwell's [[ASIN:0451524934 1984]] come to life. Until the Wall came down.<br /><br />In Nothing to Envy however, the Wall still stands, and Big Brother is still watching.in each of the profiled lives, there was a moment when they no longer believed.

B000JML7YC|4.0|First time reading Jane Austen....seen plenty of Jane Austen inspired movies and enjoyed them all but definitely prefer reading the books. Austen did not disappoint...this is a good read and keeps you routing for Catherine while guessing what will happen next.
1594488878|5.0|Nick Hornby is one of my favorite authors, but Juliet Naked, while a very enjoyable read, is not near the top of the Hornby oeuvre.  To be sure, the familiar Hornby elements are here---humor mixed with pathos, likeable adults whose flaw is a failure to grow up, obsession with music or sports (in this case, music), a \\"crisis\\" that causes the characters to mature, and unending cleverness from the author.  So what is missing?  Not much, but enough to keep it off the Hornby top tier.  The main characters come up a little short on the \\"likeability\\" scale for typical Hornby heroes, and the bad choices they had made and their general desuetude is both a unexplained and a bit annoying.   Still I grab a new Hornby as soon as I can (I actually read this book in October 2009) and greatly enjoyed this book.

0312983867|4.0|Stephanie Plum is at it again. Expect a couple of explosions, lots of lost handcuffs and a very interesting development in the Ranger/Stephanie/Morelli love triangle. We get lots of Ranger in Hard Eight, which is always a plus, but don't expect many enlightening background details. He's still very much a mystery. My one complaint is that after eight books, I would love to see Stephanie showing the slightest interest in learning how to actually be a bounty hunter instead of luckily skating by in each book. There wasn't much actual mystery solving in this addition to the series, but there was a lot of action and excitement.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|It's not big-budget effects, but the minimal use of them and the maximum use of tension and suspense that makes this work.<br /><br />As the husband, Micah, continually taunts and challenges the entity, your dread level is ratcheted up and up until the next scare sequence. Every bang and bump is invested with terror.<br /><br />If you like to be really scared, this may do the trick. If not, avoid this movie!
B00288KNLS|4.0|After Coraline (Dakota Fanning) and her parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) move to the Pink Palace Apartments, Coraline becomes frustrated by her lack of friends and her parents not paying attention to her as they work on their gardening catalog. When she runs into her neighbor Wybie (Robert Bailee Jr.), he gives her a doll he found in his grandmother's house that looks just like her. Shortly after receiving the doll Coraline finds a small door in the wall of their apartment that opens up to a brick wall. But later that night jumping mice who seemingly belong to upstairs neighbor, The Amazing Mr. Bobinsky (Ian McShane), lead her back to the door where she finds an alternate world where her parents treat her like she longs to be treated. Each night she revisits this wonderful world only to eventually find out that it's not all it's cracked up to be.    It's often a preconceived misconception that Tim Burton directed A Nightmare Before Christmas. As much as Burton wanted to direct Nightmare, he was unfortunately too busy working on Batman Returns, and was forced to place Henry Selick in the director's chair. Since then, A Nightmare Before Christmas has become a classic, being played every year in limited release around the country. This time Selick takes on Neil Gaiman. Neil Gaiman has become a much revered science fiction/ fantasy writer having written such work as the novel Stardust, which was turned into a movie in 2007, and the comic book series The Sandman as well as Coraline. Writing stories that are uniquely original with his comics including visuals that are stunning and unique in their own right, Gaiman is the perfect writer to bring to the big screen. And if you're considering using stop motion animation there are few directors other than Selick that one can think of to bring Gaiman's work to the big screen with it's integrity intact.    After seeing Coraline, I have to say that I can't think of any other filmmaker other than Tim Burton that could havedone this movie justice. The attention to detail, as it was with Nightmare, is meticulous. I generally have a little problem with not being able to completely escape reality when watching a stop-motion animation film, but with Coraline I didn't have much of a problem with that. With too much of this style of animation the director seems scared to make things dirty, gritty, and real, but Selick doesn't seem to have that much of a problem in this movie. That really aids this film as the real world Coraline lives in is a gritty world to her as opposed to the alternate reality she visits and, at first, prefers to her real life. The writing is, for the most part, impeccable despite a few clunky lines, crafting a unique story with characters that you feel for and are compelled to root for when their situations go awry.    Of course, with any animated movie the characters are only as good as the people who voice them. Here you have some great actors such as Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds, Man on Fire, I Am Sam), Keith David (Crash, Requiem for a Dream, Pitch Black), and Ian McShane (Deadwood, Kings, Sexy Beast). The voice actor that really stands out, though, is Teri Hatcher as Coraline's mother Mel Jones. As Mel Jones, Teri Hatcher doesn't just play the real world mother, but also the alternate mother creating a world for Coraline, luring her in to steal her soul. As Mel, Hatcher really makes you feel both sides of the coin of the character. She makes you feel that the alternate mother is the best fit for Coraline, but when you find out the truth she makes you despise the other mother and feel for the mother that you at first despised. This mixture of emotions for one actress to make you convey shows the brilliance of the performance as well as the visuals used by the filmmakers in the story.    Unfortunately though, later in the movie as Coraline searches for her parents and the souls of lost children the movie devolves into what feels like video game mode. The soulsof the lost children speak to her as though she's a character played by the the director rather than feeling like an organic transition. This could have been a conscious decision by the filmmakers but it feels a little gimmicky. When I got to what I thought was going to be the end of the game that the other mother was playing with Coraline I honestly felt like I was playing a game of something like Mario approaching Bowser for the final battle. That would be great if I was playing Mario, but I don't want to be taken out of a movie with the feeling that I'm playing a game that I'm not really playing.    In the end though, I fell in love with the world and plight of Coraline. I'm still not sure if I will own it, but I think it would hold up greatly in repeated viewings. I do recommend this movie, especially if you like stop motion animation, The Nightmare Before Christmas, or somewhat gothic styles movies. Selick did a great job of translating a Gaiman classic to the big screen creating a unique and original film. Before you show the kids I highly recommend that you watch it yourself. While this may be stop motion animation there are scenes that may be scarier than you'd like your kids to experience and one scene of an older woman in extremely skimpy clothing.    4/5
B002RSDW80|3.0|I generally enjoyed it, but there was too much political whining about the Red Scare (which, as historians now know, was not just paranoia). There's confusion about McCarthy and HUAC, I suspect, as is normal for Hollywood revisionism of this era. If it's as depicted, that's terrible, but the problem is that Hollywood has distorted this issue so much that my first reaction is skepticism. I don't know if people were questioned about their homosexual tendencies by HUAC, but I do know that it was McCarthy's enemies, including the liberal media, who were constanty gay-baiting during that time, while McCarthy staunchly defended his homosexual associates. (Didn't know that? Maybe you should find out that there's a whole other side of history that has been successfully hidden from you. I wish you the best on this journey.)<br /><br />Streep is wonderful as Julia; Adams is OK as the opportunistic Julie who gets famous.
B000IVW25M|1.0|I found this DVD to be incompatible with my Panasonic DVD player.  Disney acknowledged that they are aware of this problem, but offer no solution, other than to exchange for another title.

B001UV4XUG|2.0|I don't understand what the point is.<br /><br />Sure, you're told straight off the bat \\"this isn't a love story\\". But Summer is so flat despite her quirks and enigmatic-y-ism that when she finally makes her decision I didn't really care about her happiness. I don't want to give anything away, so that's all I can say.<br /><br />There was some interesting stuff going on in the main man's story, but his \\"revelation\\" about his work wasn't really that fair, so it also falls flat. You do feel for him, though.<br /><br />YMMV. For me, it was a waste of time.

B002UJIY7A|4.0|At first I was worried about the gore level (not for me, for the rest of the audience) as hinted at by other reviews, but it's really minimal. And this is a fun thrill ride of a film, with a doozy of a twist. I guessed it halfway through, but you might enjoy it more if you don't - and even if you do, the exposition is still interesting. Likeable characters you can root for, a decent script, better acting than you might expect, a twisted plot and great action towards the end make this a movie to enjoy.
0061537969|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I have ALWAYS been an animal lover and have had 4 Labrador Retrievers in my lifetime. This portrays the true spirit of the 4 legged angels that inhabit our lives.

I will give this book as a gift & reccommend it highly!

B002KS1IJC|1.0|This is a terrible movie on nearly every level.  I am so sorry for renting and wasting a precious night off watching it.  The story, acting and script are ridiculous and utterly amateurish.  It has a few decent special effects, but otherwise an absolute bore.
6305903182|4.0|In the aftermath of the second round of killings, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has retreated to a house in the middle of nowhere and works as a phone counselor.  But her life is about to be shaken up once again when a new round of killings begin.  At first she tries to ignore them, but when the killer calls her at home, she realizes she has no choice.<br /><br />The new round of killings seem to be centered around the production of Stab 3.  As the cast begins to fear for their lives, Sidney teams up with Gale Weather s (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David Arquette).  Why is the killer leaving pictures of Sid's mother on the victims?  Who will survive the latest blood bath?<br /><br />This is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, and the arguments against it have good merit.  Neve Campbell wasn't available for the full production, and Sidney's decreased presence really hurt the film since the franchise has always been about her.  Original scribe Kevin Williamson isn't back at all, and this film doesn't quite have the same satirical punch of the first two.  And the ending seems rather farfetched and out there even for this franchise.<br /><br />Despite these weaknesses, I can't help but enjoy the film.  While the jokes aren't in the same manner, there are still some funny moments in the film.  The suspense in the few scenes is still very intense.  And the final fight is very nicely done.<br /><br />While I can understand the complaints, I still enjoy this film.  It frightens and provides a few laughs along the way.  If you've enjoyed the first two, you'll want to give this one a stab.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I saw one other version of \\"Persuasion\\", and I have to tell you that this version is by far the best. The first time I saw it I fell in love with the story. Sally Hawkins plays the part of Anne Elliot so well. I could not imagine anyone else playing Anne. It wasn't too long and yet kept all the important details. I am all about the ending and the ending in this movie makes me cry every time. It is just wonderful. I have already seen it to many times to count. It is decent, which is something that is hard to find in movies nowadays. I would recommend this movie to any and all Jane Austen fans. If you love Pride and Prejudice, you will love this version of Persuasion! At least I did! :)
B001EOQWFI|5.0|In WALL-E Pixar has served up a suspenseful, heart-quenching animated science-fiction love story.  It has a nearly universal appeal.  I recommend this to anyone - even if you don't like cartoons or animated movies.  It's equally enjoyable for children and adults alike.<br /><br />I rank it in my top 5 and never tire of watching it.  The Blu-Ray version is especially magical on full-HD (1080p).
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Ignorance really is bliss.  I was aware, to an extent of how inhumane animals were treated.  I was aware of Monsantos evil ways.  But this movie still packed enough of a punch and forced me to open my eyes a little more.  Actually seeing the conditions of the animals THAT WE EAT, before they are slaughtered was just sad.  The people that work for these companies treat their employees the same way.  These are people that probably have no morals of any sort, nor do they value the human life.  It's disgusting.  After years of evolution and working hard to create rights and laws, people are still working in deplorable conditions.  Seriously, is any of this necessary, except for big monopolies to pad their pockets?<br /><br />Of course it's pro-organic, but do you really want to eat a chicken that is living in so much filth that it's fed antibiotics its entire life?  Do you want a chicken that is loaded with growth hormones?  How about a cow that's stuck in a pen on top of thousands of other cows, eating a diet of genetically modified corn and then killed inhumanely?  We should all be forced to think about what we eat and try and take action against what's really going on.  I think this country needs an overhaul of the system.  I think it needs to just blow up (come to a head), so we can go back to simpler times.<br /><br />I'm glad this movie focused on the subject at hand, without using gore and blood.  If you want to see that, go watch an action flick.  And for those that say it's biased and one sided.  Of course it is.  Just like any other controversial subject.  Take what you want from it and discard the rest.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I really wanted to order this set but held off when I read all the reviews talking about the packaging problem.  When the product went on backorder, I hoped Sony was fixing the problem and placed my order.  The set arrived with paper inserts protecting each disc.  No scratches on any disc.  I have only played the first disc in its entirety (it was the only one that was slightly difficult to remove from its slot in the package) and it was flawless.  This is a great series---don't miss it!
B001OQCV6A|3.0|Robert Downey Jr.'s film career has been in and out of the toilet so often that he's become the sort of charismatic underdog that we Americans love rooting for.  Having battled drug addiction for many years, he has seemingly managed to conquer his demons, reinvigorating his movie career while reinventing himself as a bona fide, if unlikely, Hollywood superstar.  Yet, in spite of his aforementioned charisma, and despite the occasional brilliance of his performances (\\"Chaplin\\", \\"Zodiac\\"), Downey is not automatically the best choice for any role that comes along.  In \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", his casting as the title character seems like nothing more than a ploy to capitalize on his current box office popularity, rather than an attempt on the part of the filmmakers to conjure up any faithful rendering of the beloved detective.  It's like Tony Stark (from \\"Iron Man\\") has been given an English accent and transported to Victorian-era London; there's little difference between the two characters, and the plots of each film are easily interchangeable.  And, yes, Downey won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a comedy for this, although (a) \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" can scarcely be construed as a comedy, and (b) the Hollywood Foreign Press is notoriously not always the arbitrer of great cinema. Director Guy Ritchie has refashioned Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic Brit into his own cinematic mold: a modern-day action figure who's brilliance and arrogance is only exceeded by his athletic prowess and clever asides.  In other words, Holmes has been completely \\"Hollywoodized\\".  Ritchie could as easily have cast The Rock or Bruce Willis in the role, without it being any less credible.    Having said that, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is not a disaster.  Ritchie keeps things moving at lightning speed, and the computer visuals of London are spectacular, indeed.  As Watson, Jude Law is likable (though I could actually picture him as a more convincing Holmes) but even he is transformed into a Ninja-like tough guy when the game's afoot.  In supporting roles, Mark Strong is well cast as the evil Lord Blackwood, and Eddie Marsan and William Houston make the most of their roles as cops. As Holmes love interest/nemesis, Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler is gorgeous to look at but little more than a stereotypical damsel in distress.  Much has been made regarding the undertones of the relationship between the Holmes and Watson characters in this film, but I can't imagine anyone actually buying that.  The characters are so one-dimensional and the plot so blatantly un-subtle that any hints of romance between any of the characters is strictly lip service.  Law's financee, Mary (Kelly Reilly), appears a few times to uphold the idea that he's got a fiancee, and the audience is told that Downey and McAdams have a past together, but we really don't care; the female characters are mere plot devices.  Which is too bad because I think our inability to really care about the characters lessens the suspense.      Running at a little over two hours, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is too long by a good 20 minutes, but, with all the jumping, diving, and fisticuffs, you're more likely to be overcome by a headache than boredom.  There are much better Holmes films out there--from the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies to Jeremy Brett's memorable BBC series to Rupert Everett's lone 2004 effort--but this is a Holmes for fans of action movies, Guy Ritchie, and big budget Hollywood, not for purists, so take that for what it's worth.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|really a must see film - then do your own fact checking - but still watch this watch this watch this.
B0030CIAQQ|4.0|Fact: Hans Zimmer is one of the defining composers in Hollywood.<br />Fact: This is nothing like Zimmer has ever done before.<br /><br />Sitting during the credits of this film, I sat thinking only one thing. I wasn't thinking about the movie mind you, no, I was thinking about the enchanting score that had me sit through the whole credits so I could take in its complete wonder.<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Discombobulate<br />Not In Blood, But In Blood<br /><br />The movie's theme if you will, is shown most prominently in \\"Discombobulate,\\" and it's this theme that entranced me with it's marching symphony of strings and drums, and even instruments more commonly associated with Indian music. Remember how Pirates of the Caribbean was quickly defined and permeated with its theme? Well this is the same way, and musically, the theme reminds me a lot of that one as well. It's a theme that permeates the soundtrack, but it's also the truly good piece of music on here. Therefore, all the tracks that don't have a semblance of this theme are less than stellar, with the exception of \\"Not In Blood, But In Blood,\\" which carries a haunting violin screeching. That's not to say the rest of the score is bad, it's just not very memorable/creative.<br /><br />Overall, highlighted by the classic driving theme, Hans Zimmer uprises an otherwise drab soundtrack. It's not revolutionary in the least, but it does provide one excellent track, and an interesting listen. Now if only Hans Zimmer could expand on the ideas laid out here for the sequel...
B00007LTIL|3.0|American Beauty - The Grateful Dead (2.5 stars)<br />Original Release: 11/1/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Box of Rain (3 stars)<br />Loose playing rolls along like a river after rain in the hills.  The lyrics ask what one can do to help another through the illusion of life created by ourselves.  The song builds very subtly in the brief bridge in the middle but goes no further.  There is almost a nervous energy, but not quite.<br /><br />Friend of the Devil (3 stars)<br />Singer sounds like a character from a John Steinbeck or the character \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\"; someone always on the run maintaining a sense of self-sympathy.  Folksy guitar and instruments just dance out the notes.  It is interesting listening to the lyrical protagonist's issues and his casual acceptance of it all.<br /><br />Sugar Magnolia (2 stars)<br />Is this about a woman or a mood-modifying substance?  I suppose an artist's goal is to let the listener decide.  Nice imagery and a slight boogie to the rhythm on this song.<br /><br />Operator (2 stars)<br />Man desperately trying to drop a line to a woman going her own way; in this day of cellphones and facebook this wouldn't be such a problem.  The song sounds like a traditional country or folk song.<br /><br />Candy Man (2 stars)<br />Slowing down the tempo a notch, there is a slight swing to the melody.  Gambler passes through town.  Men are drawn by lady luck; women are drawn to the traveller.  Life is a series of random events for the rambler, occassional urge to violence.  The candy is the chance to win just once I suppose or a metaphor for the effects of cocaine.  Instrumental section brings a plaintive guitar and a limp into a minor key at places.<br /><br />Ripple (3 stars)<br />Interesting song to set against ELP's Take a Pebble (albums released in close proximity).  Here, the individual's path is his own.  The message complements the passive lecture of \\"Box of Rain\\".  Water seems to be a metaphor for the pain and suffering that is part of our lives.  The song ends with a small crowd singing in the background.<br /><br />Brokedown Palace (2 stars)<br />Lyrics speak metaphorically of the body and the river as the means to finally wash that body away.  The river sings a heavenly song; the river is home.  Loose piano and vocals make the melody twist and turn gently like a river, a mood/mode that is prevalent throughout the album.<br /><br />Till the Morning Comes (2 stars)<br />This is a more upbeat song asking a woman to let go of her worrying it seems.  The rhythm sports a slight funk.<br /><br />Attics of My Life (3 stars)<br />This song is much slower and almost like a chant.  At one point the melody skips a beat...was this a purposeful mistake?  The lyrics suggest that there is something that one can call upon when one can't find what is wanted in one's self.  The vocals are hypnotic as is the pace of the song.<br /><br />Truckin' (3 stars)<br />Sounds like a catalog of various experiences, often not pleasant, that the band accumulated from touring around the country.  I'm not at all familiar with the band's history, but I can see from the song that they felt hounded at times.  This song features more aggressive guitar playing over a shuffle.<br /><br />Album:<br />Although I am a fan of some of the Grateful Dead's music I am not a fan of this popular album.  I do not know what attracts people to this pleasant though \\"plain\\" music.  There is mystery in the lyrics and interesting chord progressions but they pass like a brief summer breeze.  The album consists of loosely played pop country songs with a lightly infectious quality.  Overall the album's tone acts like a mild depressant.  The samples will tell it all here, you like the mood or you don't.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br />These are the songs that I preferred.<br /><br />Better Half (3 stars)<br />1.  Box of Rain (3 stars)<br />2.  Friend of the Devil (3 stars)<br />3.  Ripples (3 stars)<br />4.  Attics of My Life (3 stars)<br />5.  Truckin' (3 stars)ruckin' (3 stars)
044654146X|5.0|START-UP NATION: THE STORY OF ISRAEL'S ECONOMIC MIRACLE considers how a nation of only 7.1 million and only 60 years old produces more start-up companies than larger, stable nations of the world. This focus on politics, business and culture offers insights that are key to understanding both Israel and global economic challenges and makes for a survey that will go far beyond the usual Judaic studies collection, reaching into libraries strong in business, social science, and history.

0061864153|5.0|Author and photographer Phil Griffin received unparalleled access to the band's lives and archives: since Bon Jovi has offered few insights into its makeup and background, this access translates to a 'must' for any Bon Jovi collection. From members' lives on the road and at home to the span of a 25-year career paired with unique black and white photos, this is a powerful pick any music library needs.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout DVD. I sweat so much after workout for just a little while. The only downside is that every time I want to workout I have to sit thought a very long DVD intro which I can't skip.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had my first listen to this album at the gym, while exercising on an elliptical machine with headphones on.  I was expecting to hear more of the same type of music from their previous two albums - both of which I love.  After listening to X&Y more than a few times; I felt the desire to resurrect Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head and reacquaint myself with them.  X&Y is an impressive display of the versatility Coldplay possesses as a band.  The sound of this album is more sonic and suited for large stadium and area venues.  This is popular rock music, compared to the more edgy rock sound of the two previous albums.  I like that Chris Martin is using more of the upper register of his voice, along with his signature falsetto.  He sings with great ease a naturalness.  Why some people accuse Coldplay of attempting to sound like U2 is beyond me.  The two bands have completely different sounds.  Bono's voice and delivery is angst driven; but Chris Martin sings with a more sensitive expressive of pain and heartache.  Coldplay doesn't have the same sense of urgency as U2.  I am a fan of both of these great bands; but each of them offer me something different.  When this album first came out, people were criticizing the Coldplay for trying something different from their previous efforts.  I believe that it is important to understand how important it is for gifted artists to make creative efforts NOT to repeat themselves; but to experiment and take risks.  Boldness and riskiness is necessary in order to grow.  I was not surprised to find that in VIVA LA VIDA Coldplay took an even greater risk - a big giant one indeed; and the result was absolutely amazing.
B0006Q0XDW|5.0|Bought this album for my child for Christmas.  Quick to ship.  No problems.
0061767581|4.0|I'm a fan of the show 'The Hills' so this was pretty much similar to her story of being on TV.  Although there are a few changes to the story, most of it reminds of incidents that happened to her on the show.  If you liked the show, you'll like the book.  If you don't enjoy the show, you might want to skip out on the book as well.
1906355630|5.0|The author has a fresh, fun writing style that kept me laughing as I read this informative book.  As I got to know Twitter, I also got to know Adrian because he shared life memories at the beginning of each chapter that became metaphors for aspects of the Twitter world.  Very clever.    The step-by-step explanations of how to use Twitter will be very helpful!  With this book, a social media novice (like me) will feel more comfortable engaging in the online world.
B000OT8GCQ|2.0|I honestly can't understand the gushing reviews for this simplistic, bland novel. About half way through I went back to Amazon to see if this was in the young-adult category, because that's how it reads: Teenaged, uncomplicated, lacking in depth and complex emotion and very self-indulgent. There's very little real storyline here and it's full of page after page of incredibly stilted and trite dialogue. I not only wasn't invested in what happened next to the characters, I actually couldn't care less.
B002ZMZBD2|4.0|The soundtrack for this movie was spectacular and this is a good CD, but it's missing some of the music that was in the film.  Mostly noticeably absent was the the great Irish music vocal, \\"The Rocky Road to Dublin,\\" by The High Kings.  This song made the Holmes fight scene even more dramatic, and it also made the credits at the end more enjoyable.  I was disappointed to find that it wasn't included in the soundtrack CD.
0143038419|3.0|I read all types of books. I enjoy the author's personality throughout this book. I enjoy \\"light\\" books right before bed, and this fits the bill. A light-hearted story to stop your own busy mind and focus on someone elses life.     When I really think about this book, it makes me gag. This woman went through what type of hardship? A divorce? Then breakup from a different guy? That's it???? And she had to take a whole year off from life to become ok with this? And not only that, but it seems like she's been suffering for several years because of all this.     Is she for real? Does she understand that people suffer through much worse than what she's been through? And they certainly do not have the luxury to run off to Rome then India then Bali for a whole entire year!!!     Again, a pleasant read right before bed. Helped me sleep like a baby. But.......... Elizabeth Gilbert........... Get Real.........

B000056N8X|1.0|I bought this movie for $1.00 at a local flea market.  I want my dollar back!  This movie was very disappointing.  I loved the first Highlander movie and the television series, Endgame is does not even come close to either of those.  The villain was prissy and way too manic.  He certainly did not seem like the bad ass killing machine he was supposed to be in this movie.  Duncan's love interest is not at all interesting.  Connor sleepwalks his way through the film.  The flashbacks of Connor are terrible, he looks old and worn out.  I know actors age but, couldn't they come up with some botox or at least better make-up for Christopher Lambert?  The plot has more holes than a fishing net.  Duncan kills his wife to activate her \\"immortality\\", no way!  A bunch of rogue immortals forming a gang? Ridiculous. Why didn't this gang of idiots figure out that their power mad leader would kill them all to gain their quickening?  There was way too much fighting and not enough decent dialogue.  At the end, it was painfully obvious that Adrian Paul was standing in front of a computerized image of the highlands at Connor's grave.  What cheap crap was that?  The cameos of Joe and Methos (two of my favorite supporting characters in the tv series)were uninspired and unnecessary.  This movie was a waste of my dollar, my time, and the efforts of the entire cast and crew.

B001GJOL22|2.0|Been a fan for years and I don't have any Concert Blu-ray's to compare. I read dozens of reviews before investing in this one to be disapointed. Maybe I was expected to be blow away. The picture looked crisp for a live concert. The sound seemed to be weak. What can I say other than I kept looking for other settings on my Denon to improve the sound. Something I never do when surfing the concert channels.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|I am really really disappointed with Disney for not including Closed Captioning or Subtitles for this movies. How are the deaf and hard of hearing supposed to watch this!?

B000002HH9|5.0|Many Cure fans dislike Wild Mood Swings. Not me, though: I like it more than [[ASIN:B000002HAJ Wish]]. For one thing, it's much more energetic, with 14 songs that last an hour, whereas Wish had 13 songs lasting 66 minutes. Although Wish has many good songs, somehow they can get to sound monotonous if you listen to the whole album straight through. The songs on Wild Mood Swings, however, move along much faster, mostly avoiding this problem.<br /><br />More importantly, Wild Mood Swings really has the light touch. The first song \\"Want\\" is a dark, driving anthem with a loud, droning lead, which is common in Cure albums (Wish started with one, too, and then let's not forget \\"[[ASIN:B000002H70 Disintegration]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B0001906O0 Burn]]\\"). But rarely does this technique sound as effortless and graceful as here. The lead is basically pounding out two notes, but the arrangement soars (possibly thanks to [[ASIN:B000002LRJ Alan Moulder]] -- the first and last time The Cure worked with him). Halfway through the song, a beautiful string melody intertwines with the main lead, and it sounds just as vigorous as the distorted guitar in \\"Open.\\"<br /><br />\\"Want\\" is the only anthem on the album. Much of Wild Mood Swings indulges the lounge-act side of The Cure. This is exactly why many Cure fans hate it, but I can't get enough. This was always part of The Cure. Robert Smith always had a bit of the lounge lizard in him, the dandy who likes to visit exotic places and stay in luxurious hotels, where he has numerous affairs with sophisticated demimondaines. You can trace this all the way back to [[ASIN:B000005S0B Japanese Whispers]], \\"[[ASIN:B000ICL3C4 The Caterpillar]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B000ICL3CE Close To Me]].\\" So when he finally explores this side of himself on Wild Mood Swings, the results are amazing. This album has the best pop section of The Cure's entire discography. The songs are playful and fun, with the light touch I mentioned earlier. For example, \\"Mint Car\\" basically repeats \\"Friday I'm In Love,\\" but it greatly improves on the formula, sounding less laboured and more energetic and delirious. It even has a brief but cool guitar solo.<br /><br />And \\"Mint Car\\" is actually the least creative of the lot. Other songs contain some dazzlingly inventive music. My favourite is \\"Gone,\\" which is based on an angular bass line. The rhythm suggests some sort of jazz or Caribbean music, but the production gives the bass a deep, cavernous sound, a hint of darkness. It is a really interesting sound; if \\"Gone\\" wasn't successful as a single, it's only because no one was ready for it. Meanwhile, \\"The 13th\\" is a drunken mariachi song with woozy, cheerful horns, and \\"Strange Attraction\\" glitters with an impossibly clean, gorgeous keyboard line.<br /><br />Another great thing about Wild Mood Swings is the writing. Starting with [[ASIN:B00004GOVO Bloodflowers]], Robert Smith's lyrics became extremely formulaic. Wild Mood Swings, however, recalls the good old days when he was quite a strong poet. Don't believe me? Just listen to \\"Strange Attraction,\\" yet another Cure song about a failed romance, but with an abundance of quirky detail: \\"The year grew old, incessantly she wrote to me / She'd started smoking poetry! / I laughed in recognition of a favourite phrase / She'd pulled me in...I answered her, a Christmas card in sepia arranging when and where the two of us should meet / Her opening so well-prepared, a nervous smile, I couldn't take my eyes from her / She whispered, 'Can I use some of your lipstick?'\\" Even reading it is enjoyable, but when you listen to the way he makes these lines fit perfectly into the bouncy rhythm, you can see just how much of a kick he got out of writing this.<br /><br />Smith's writing has this sort of detail throughout most of the album, even the slow, sad, somewhat less thrilling numbers. \\"Jupiter Crash\\" is another moody breakup song that finds time to observe the collision of Comet SL9 with Jupiter: \\"Was that it, was that the Jupiter show? Kinda wasn't quite what I'd hoped for, you know?\\" This, of course, is used to illustrate Smith's disappointment regarding another failed love, but hey, better this than just wailing about loneliness.<br /><br />The album's only real weakness is \\"Club America,\\" because the music consists of the same overbearing flood of wah-wah as \\"Cut\\" from Wish. This sound was later abused even more on Bloodflowers (\\"Watching Me Fall,\\" \\"39\\") and the [[ASIN:B00028HOFY self-titled album]] (\\"The Promise\\"). The lyrics are actually not bad, but all the squealing feedback drowns them out, and the song is quite long (five minutes, third-longest on the album). This sound really doesn't fit in here. If Smith wanted to write a flamboyant song about clubs, he should have tried to incorporate an actual club sound, something like their heavily underrated 1998 non-album [[ASIN:B000002HR2 single]] \\"Wrong Number.\\" The Cure also had some fine B-sides around this time that could have replaced this song, as well.<br /><br />But that's it -- the rest is splendid. You can occasionally see some traces of lazy writing creep in (\\"This Is A Lie\\"), or songs that repeat ideas from Wish (\\"Treasure\\" and \\"To Wish Impossible Things\\"). The lack of Boris Williams on drums is also unfortunate. But there's always something interesting going on, like elegant strings that sound either delicate (\\"This Is A Lie\\") or strong (\\"Numb\\"), or when all else fails, Smith's peerless talent for beautiful, languid melancholy (\\"Treasure,\\" \\"Bare\\"). Wild Mood Swings was doomed at the charts -- it was not angry enough for 90s alt-rock, not sarcastic or rowdy enough for Britpop, and not gloomy enough for Cure fans -- but it's the last time Smith ever really pushed himself. This is definitely the album he wanted; it finds him indulging himself and exploring odd and interesting ideas, and those ideas inspired him enough to make the last truly great Cure album.hoped for, you know?\\" This, of course, is used to illustrate Smith's disappointment regarding another failed love, but hey, better this than just wailing about loneliness.

Since the author died before completing the series, I was worried that this final book would lack a concrete ending, but it really does wrap up quite nicely.  Kudos to the sweedish translator who again did a fantastic job.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|This book left me breathless. Spot on descriptions of hookers and priests under our dearly missed trade towers stayed with me thru eggnog, church, and mean relative's whining at Cmas. A delight and joy to have met the characters.
1594201927|4.0|Depending on what you hope to find, your satisfaction will vary. Having read John Kenneth Galbraith's \\"[[ASIN:0735100705 Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went]],\\" I was curious to see what  Niall Ferguson had to add. I enjoyed the writing style and the book is well organized by concepts: money, banking, bonds, stocks, bubbles, risk, insurance, housing, mortgages, securitizing and hedging. In each case Ferguson tells the story of what gave rise to the new development.<br /><br />I enjoyed the earlier chapters from caveman to \\"Safe as Houses\\" but not so much Chapter 6, \\"From Empire to Chimerica\\" which is still history in the making. Where should a historian stop?<br /><br />My main disappointment was in what I did not find. I had hopes to find a discussion of wealth qua wealth, specially after reading the introduction. Instead what I did find were the various mechanisms of managing wealth, which, while interesting, is not quite the same thing.<br /><br />My issues with Chapter 6, \\"From Empire to Chimerica\\" are multiple. For one, the explanation of securitizing is sketchy, there is no clear distinction between the original residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), which were quite safe, and the toxic waste that was created from the lower tranches of these original securities, which, as far as I can see, is where the problems were created. Also, there is no mention of the casino nature of the credit default swaps (CDS). When selling insurance you are only supposed to insure the risk of loss, you cannot insure a $250,000 home for a million dollars. Apparently you could buy any amount of credit default swaps whether you had the risk or not. That is criminal.<br /><br />Lastly, Ferguson talks about the huge amount of American debt that China has taken on. All debts must be discharged one way or another, either paid off or defaulted. Maybe as a historian the author does not feel the need to suggest a denouement but I sure would have liked to hear his opinion.

B002UJIY7A|3.0|......but quite entertaining and twisty but so many have talked about the switch near the end that I had no trouble figuring out who the killers were. The movie is a bit slow for the first 45 minutes or so but we get to meet the characters, the newlyweds--a macho man who claims he is \\"hard to kill\\" and his impatient girlfriend who keeps hoping her macho man with the steel plate in his head would move the relationship along to a higher plain--and a obnoxious and menacing third couple.    The mystery centers around another newlywed couple who have been brutally murdered with the understanding that a couple is responsible for the murders. Oh,Oh.  Out of nowhere a police helicopter lands and handcuffs and carts off the menacing couple. Then each of the other two couples confess that they each thought the other were the killers.   Now they are free to enjoy each others company and have a perfect getaway. NOT. Forget about the twist-if you read the other reviews you know it's coming and I haven't helped matters either but just sit back and enjoy-the last part is tense, just a bit bloody and has one character who has a change of heart and sees the right person is shot through the head by the police. I enjoyed the movie while I viewed it but don't think it's the kind of a movie you will ever re-watch.
B002HML6Y8|4.0|And my job is to tell you what a great movie this is, and how eye poppingly wow the blu-ray is! A wonderful horror-adventure story paying homage to the universal monster movie classics! Hugh Jackman is fantastic in the lead role as Van Helsing and the rest of the cast make this a fun watch. Plenty of tongue and cheek moments but the action and scares will make you jump too. Completely enjoyable.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: For those of you who own the ultimate edition this blu-ray version comes with all the extras except for the original universal monster movies (Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman). If you want those I suggest picking up the special editions on DVD. As for the look and sound of this movie...WOW!!! DEMO DISC!!! SHOW THIS TO YOUR FRIENDS!!! ABSOLUTELY WORTHY TO UPGRADE!!!
0316172324|5.0|I had great fun reading Gladwell's 'Outliers', so I bought 'Blink' and had a greater blast. The book is packed with mind provoking examples to illustrate vividly the challenge of figuring how to 'combine the best of conscious deliberation and instinctive judgment' in our daily lives. The newly added Afterword by Gladwell also put his original writing in a concise context, with pragmatic 'call to action'. I do hope that 'Blink' can encourage one to apply its insight in solving practical problems, it certainly has the power to lead me to do so.

0375842209|3.0|I don't like World War II fiction. I don't like the fact that I haven't read a single World War II book that isn't a tragedy. World War II was a seriously horrible time when horrible things happened, and I don't like reading about those horrible things. So clearly, The Book Thief? Not the book for me. The narration, personification, and imagery were remarkable, but the story itself? Meh. It moved slowly, and nothing much happened until the predictable ending. It's easy to see where it's going, both due to its subject matter and choice of narrator. Zusak does do a wonderful job delving into the mindsets of all of his characters, particularly the complexity of a child's--Liesel's--mind. It's a great mix of a child's mind forced to live and function in an adult world. The foreshadowing, though adding to the predictability, adds to the book and the complexity of the narration. But again, there comes a point where it just plot-wise becomes everyotherworldwarII book and is no longer enjoyable. I don't know...I can see this being used in classrooms, and if someone has yet to read any World War II fiction, I would recommend them to start with this one, but for someone just looking for a casual read, look the other way.<br /><br />Rating: 2.5/5
B002P5XXR0|5.0|So far I've seen Avatar twice and I'm sure that I'll see it again before it's available for DVD or BluRay purchase so until then I thrilled to be able to enjoy the soundtrack. I'm not going to get picky here about what is or isn't here, for example I'm certain that there are some of the more \\"chant\\" like songs missing, whbut what I really appreciate is that the spirit of the movie, the soaring movements, the suspense and anticipation is here. For me that's what's important, when I close my eyes I can see the movie again in my mind, the lanscapes, the \\"people\\". I like it! I do. So if you're a fan of the movie and want a reminder, a way to transport yourself back to Pandora, here's a great way to do so.

1594488916|4.0|At first glance, the title of this book, The Man Who Loved Books Too Much, may have you thinking that this is a work concerning a man that is fanatical about books. A man that, if you were fortunate, would show you his extensive personal library. Perhaps on one level, that is true. However, the main character in this non-fiction book is a collector of rare books. And a thief. The chances that anyone would be able to view his library are remote, mainly because the police confiscated it and returned the books to the rightful owners.    Contents:  Prologue; Like a Moth to a Flame; Half-truths; Richie Rich; A Gold Mine; Spider-Man; Happy New Year; Trilogy of Kens; Treasure Island; Brick Row; Not Giving Up; This Call May Be Recorded or Monitored; What More Could I Ask?; And Look: More Books!; The Devil's Walk Afterword; Acknowledgements; Notes; A Note on Sources    Allison Hoover Bartlett introduces the reader to obsession; to have some of the world's rarest books. Some people pay for them, collect them, others steal them. The Man Who Loved Books Too Much focuses on two individuals, Ken Sanders, the Security Chair of Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA) and John Gilkey, the bibliokleptomaniac who was the focus of Sanders' investigation. Gilkey, using his position in a retail store, would use stolen credit card information to place orders with rare book dealers for specific items. The dealers would find later that the purchase was fraudulent, however Gilkey had the book. Sanders picks up his trail, and using tenacity, cooperation, and excellent investigative skills, is able to have Gilkey arrested.    Bartlett does an excellent job, early in the book, of following both men, Sanders and Gilkey. It is a top notch \\"true crime\\" narrative. Bartlett follows Gilkey as he steals rare books and then flashes to Sanders as he attempts to bring him to justice. The early chapters are enjoyable, especially as the reader gains an insight into the world of rare books, the people who collect them. and those that deal in them. Bartlett also provides insight into the role that books play in our lives, which cannot be found in e-book readers. However, while Bartlett had incredible access to Gilkey, the book takes a strange turn in the second half as she becomes too close to her subject. It is at that point which made this reader uncomfortable. I was expecting more detachment, which never materializes. Further, Bartlett loses focus on Sanders in the latter chapters, which is unfortunate, as there was probably more to discover about him and the world of rare books. It may have been that she did not enjoy the same level of access with him as she had with Gilkey, but it would have made for a more complete book. Finally, and it is a rather minor criticism, the inclusion of some pictures of the principles would have been appreciated. Overall, however, The Man Who Loved Books Too Much is a good book on obsession and how those desires can control a person.

B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I was on the pre-order list for the New Moon soundtrack.  The first time I listened to it I got chills.  As you all know, this was released on 10/16/09, I have to say that I can't put it away.  I seriously listen to it everyday over and over. (And it is now 1/18/10.) I love the artists and have found myself looking for, and ordering, more of their music.     Seriously can't name favorites cause I love all the songs.  Then to find them in the movie...  they all fell into place perfectly.     AMAZING!!!!
B002XTBEDI|3.0|It's fun to spend a little time with some of the characters from the deservedly successful \\"Cranford,\\" but that's about all that can be said for this weak 2-part sequel.  As others have pointed out, it's a much thinner stitchery of Gaskell's work, presumably to capitalize on the performance of the first series.  Worth watching for the pleasure of seeing some wonderful actors, but it's really only in the \\"mildly diverting\\" category.
0312370849|4.0|I begrudgingly started reading this last night because my book club meeting was fast approaching. I could not put it down! The novel is hauntingly beautiful and even after I finished it, I kept thinking about it which is the mark of a great novel.    Why only 4 stars? At times I found the book to be overly-mushy like the author was trying too hard to pull at the heartstrings. Also it was a smidge predictable at time.     Great for casual reading or book club selection.

0786868724|5.0|Simply describing Mitch Albom's \\"have a little faith: a true story\\" as inspiring does not do it justice.  It is a book I would highly recommend to book clubs, for rainy days, escapism, soul-searching, and one not to put away in an old tupperware tub - the reader will definitely want to read it again and again.<br /><br />It is a story that reaches across generations, and will continue to do so.  No matter what the situation the reader has been in or witnessed, there will be a connection, one that will both awaken the mind and the heart.<br /><br />Here's but one of many brilliant examples:<br />\\"But what if someone from another faith won't recognize yours?  Or wants you dead for it?<br />`That is not faith.  That is hate.' He sighed.  `And if you ask me, God sits up there and cries when that happens.'\\"<br /><br />In a world where those who live within feel an increasing loss of control on a number of levels, this book connects us all.  All as humans, all as individual souls, all who at some point in our lives have had at least a little faith.  Perhaps if we continue to do so, the world will be a better place.  It is not enough for us to wait for the next tragedy to do our part.  We need to embrace our humanity and share this world the way it was meant to be shared and do so on a daily basis.<br /><br />A wonderful wonderful book.  Well done, Mr. Albom!<br /><br />J.R.

B00275EGX8|5.0|One definition sometimes given for a \\"hurt locker\\" is \\"a period of extreme physical or emotional pain.\\" This movie shows that a war can very well be both. It follows an Army unit responsible for disposing of explosives, either by disarming or deliberating exploding them. It follows the three men both on the job and off, providing a window on their characters. Far from your typical war movie, the story is basically about the characters with the war as the backdrop.     During 2004 in Baghdad, Sergeant William James joins Sergeant J.T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge in Bravo Company, who have over 30 days left in their rotation. He's replacing the previous team leader who died trying to \\"safely\\" detonate an explosive device found in the streets. Such is the daily routine in Iraq where explosives are found hidden in anything from a car to a dead body. Eldridge suffers from feelings of guilt, believing his inaction lead to their leader's death. Sanborn and Eldridge soon both become wary of their new leader when James recklessly goes by himself to manually disarm a bomb when they would typically use a robot first. Is James crazy and will he get them all killed?    Bombs aren't the only danger the unit encounters. Driving in their Humvee, they stop when they find a group of unknowns who turn out to be friendlies. It isn't long before they're under fire from enemies hiding out near the sand dunes. Beyond the edge-of-your-seat intensity and violence, there's also a strong emotional component to the movie. James becomes friendly with a young boy selling DVDs on the street and soon discovers the consequences of making friends in a war zone. When an innocent man approaches Army soldiers to ask for help with explosives which have been strapped to his body, James can't do much more than say he's sorry. Despite the atrocities he witnesses on a daily basis, James somehow finds himself drawn to the war. As quoted at the start of the movie, \\"war is a drug\\".    This movie is sorealistic in its depiction of war that it almost feels like a documentary; however, it is far from being dry like some real war documentaries can be. It makes you feel for the soldiers who risk their lives every day, never knowing when or from where the next explosion will come. Although none of the actors truly stand out, it's a great ensemble cast. The writing and direction are first rate and truly make you feel you're in a war zone where anything and anyone around you could be dangerous. I highly recommend this movie when you're looking for an intense, intelligent movie about war. This isn't a movie for those looking for light entertainment though.
0786838655|4.0|Imagine being twelve and living with your mother and your evil, beer drinking, poker playing, smelly step-father. Imagine you're dyslexic, ADHD, and have only one friend at school. Imagine that school is the sixth school you've attended in as many years, and you're failing every class but Latin. Then imagine you go on a field trip, get blamed for pushing a mean girl into a fountain, and end up running for your life from your math teacher who has turned into a crazy bat-lady with fangs. That's what Percy Jackson has to deal with in The Lightning Thief. He doesn't know why he's different, but somehow he is.<br /><br />Everything that happens to Percy leads to the revelation that he's the son of a Greek god. Not knowing which god is his father, he travels to Camp Half-Blood where other children of the gods train and prepare for future quests. When Percy is framed for the theft of Zeus' master lightning bolt, he and his friends Grover and Annabeth must travel to Los Angeles to find the underworld lord Hades, and retrieve what was stolen to clear Percy's name and stop the brewing war among the gods. On the way they learn that nothing is as simple as it seems.<br /><br />Book 1 of Percy Jackson & The Olympians definitely made me want to read Book 2, and so on. It wasn't meant to be a heavy and serious novel, but simply a fun, fantasy-filled, magical book which made me reminisce of Harry Potter. I didn't want the book to end because I can't start the second one right away. I look forward to the continuing adventures of Percy and his friends. I'd highly recommend this if you're sad that Harry Potter is done, and you want something else to make you feel young again. The Lightning Thief is meant for children, and for the children at heart.
006097625X|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I am very design and artistically challenged. I enjoy art passively. \\"Understanding Comics\\" introduced me to concepts in art and comics specifically. Scott knows as much, if not more about comics as anyone else. This is a brilliant book which presents really complex concepts to the readers in a way that a reader can understand, appreciate and remember these concepts.  Why are we not taught these books at school. There is so much about design to learn from the book. I had borrowed the copy from a library but I am buying a copy now.

0307266303|5.0|I came to this story having heard great things about it from a running standpoint.  I'm a fledgling distance runner and was looking for some inspiration and tips.  What I hadn't expected was that this would be a compelling story, one full of fascinating characters, mystery, intrigue, and humor.  I didn't expect such an excellent STORY.    When the author's foot started to hurt and he was told that perhaps he just shouldn't run anymore, something about that didn't seem right to him.  It seemed to him that all humans ought to have the right equipment to run.  As he is not only a runner, but also a journalist, the author has a great many resources when he comes across a theory he wishes to explore.  So he set off to find a legendary (mythical?) running tribe in Mexico called the Tarahumara.    Along the way toward fixing his own physical problems, the author takes deadly drives through Mexican drug country, follows ultrarunning circuits, gets involved in the planning stages of an epic race between obsessed Americans and Tarahumara Indians, and speaks to evolutionary biologists who theorize that man evolved to be a runner.    I loved this book and couldn't put it down.  I was able to gain some usable tips from it that relate to my own running, but more than that, I was simply pulled into this amazing story of people who love to run and who are capable of pushing their bodies to do truly incredible things.

B001QOGYFO|5.0|I have no problem with this film. It's a good B grade piece of cinema that should not be compared to a high profile smash hit at the box office.    Great cast. All veteran actors.   Great cinematography. From handheld to landscape.   Sturdy screenplay. To the point dialogue.   Skillful direction. Neat and quick.   Challenging. How long will it take you to guess the culprit?    Some nifty cutting scenes between Tom Skerritt and Kate Beckinsale.   Categorically, a very good thriller with an unusual setting in a remote area.   See it. Enjoy.

In the name of Honesty, his policies that are and being enacted are the same policies he narrates in his book, heard in his campaigns for senate and the presidency.

If you love James Taylor you will love this. 2 songs which I have never heard of before are now my favoites. In The Bleak Midwinter and Some See Him are typical soft and pretty James Taylor. His version of Auld Lang Syne is very nice as well. James Taylor's music is mood altering and this CD is no exception. When work gets stressful I listen to James and I feel better.

Two weeks later and I still get the surge of excitement when listening, the goosebumps, and I find that my hands always go to turn up the volume a little more, as if I'm trying to hug the music- it's that good!!!
0393075966|4.0|In Joseph E. Stigliz's new book, \\"Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy,\\" the author provides what he believes to be the causes of the Great Recession of 2008. Moreover, he looks at the responses to the mess by both the George W. Bush administration as well as the Obama administration. From there, he makes suggestions as to what might be done to rectify the situation.<br /><br />He explains how over leveraged banks, a shady, self-serving mortgage industry and predatory lending contributed to the meltdown and how these so-called rescue attempts by government failed to halt the free fall.<br /><br />The author was one of several economists who predicted the current state of affairs. About one of the chapters of the book he says, \\"I suspect that if the government adopted the simple proposals of this chapter, the foreclosure problem would be a thing of the past,\\" he writes. \\"But regrettably, the Obama administration has followed the course of the Bush administration, directing most of its efforts at rescuing the banks.\\"<br /><br />It should be noted that Stiglitz is a Keynesian --- the same folks who brought us The Great Recession. So if you, like me, are a believer in Austrian economics, you won't likely buy into much of what he has to say.<br /><br />He does, however, make some cogent points. For example,  he writes that \\"when an economy is weak, very weak as the world economy appeared in early 2009, attack with overwhelming force.\\" Tackling the problem with what he sees as \\"insufficient ammunition,\\" he adds, \\"was a dangerous strategy, especially as it became increasingly clear that the Obama administration had underestimated the strength of the downturn, including the increase in unemployment.\\"<br /><br />I found the book interesting. But if you're not a Keynesian, you find it all a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, all points of view have something to recommend them. And this book is no exception.<br /><br />- Susanna K. Hutcheson
0061703257|4.0|It is 1954, World War II veteran and U. S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, located on \\"Shutter Island\\" in Massachusetts. A patient named Rachel Solando has mysteriously disappeared, even though she was kept in a locked room under constant supervision.  Shortly after Daniels and Aule reach their destination, a violent hurricane knocks out the electricity and chaos ensues.  The storm mirrors Teddy's dark mood; he suspects that something sinister is going on here.  In addition, he has a secret agenda that has impelled him to visit this place, one that he cannot reveal to anyone.<br /><br />Lehane describes Shutter Island in meticulous detail, with its steep cliffs, numerous caves, debris-filled shoreline, and large rat population.  This is a spooky locale with a fort, a lighthouse, and other old structures that were used during the Civil War. The island's isolation strikes a chord in Teddy, who has been intensely lonely since he lost his wife, Dolores, under tragic circumstances. When Teddy and Chuck meet one of the hospital's psychiatrists, Dr. J. Cawley, along with the doctor's colleagues, they sense that some members of the staff may be lying to them.  What are they hiding?  Worse yet, to what lengths are they willing to go to conceal their activities?<br /><br />Readers who expect a shocking conclusion will not be disappointed.  What transpires in this disturbing, suspenseful, and far-out thriller completely shatters both Teddy's and our illusions.  This is a melancholy novel, in which Lehane implies that so-called civilized people are capable, under certain circumstances, of committing unspeakable acts.  In addition, the line between emotionally stable and insane individuals is not as clear-cut as we would like to believe.

0143038419|1.0|Amazon defines its one-star rating as \\"I hated it\\".  I don't hate this book, and without all of the hype surrounding it, I probably would have given it two stars.  It does contain a few nice images, and can be pleasurable to read during the few pages in which Gilbert decides to show us what's going on rather than tell us through an unending stream of similes, many of which left me literally rolling my eyes. But all that hype is indeed out there, and the release of Gilbert's new book, Committed, has only inflated it.<br /><br />If you've made it all the way down to this review, you already know what this book is about, in the sense of what happens in it.  I am still unsure of what this book is REALLY about, in the sense of what the point of it is.  Is it about overcoming depression?  Is it about dealing with divorce?  Is it about the restorative power of travel?  Is it about \\"finding God\\" (whatever that means)?  The best I can offer is that it is about Gilbert, and how awesome her year-long (almost) vacation is.  Every conversation she recounts turns to her and her problems -- should I get back together with my ex-boyfriend? -- which is unfortunate, because, as a writer, Gilbert's strength seems to be dialogue, although even some of that sounds artificial.<br /><br />Other parts of the book feel artificial as well, and worse yet, superficial.  She fails to go into depth about anything but herself.  And even then, she does not do (or at least she does not share) the kind of internal work that results in self-awareness.  Instead, she wanders off into anecdotes and spiritual stories, but always ends up in the same place.  Oh no, I got a bladder infection from having too much sex!  Oh no, the Italian men aren't trying to grab my butt like they did when I was here at age 19.  It took someone who nicknamed her \\"Groceries\\" to tell her, at age 34, that she's a control freak.<br /><br />This book lacks both a foundational metaphor (which I believe all books need to be worthwhile) and narrative drive.  As a result, the work the reader puts into it remains unrewarded.<br /><br />If you are interested in a travelogue, I recommend In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson, or perhaps A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson, which is a travelogue of a different sort.  If you are interested in an internal/external travelogue, I recommend Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig.  The first will educate you, entertain you, and encourage you to get on the next plane to Oz.  The second will impress upon you exactly how lucky we human beings are to be here at all, and the third will present to you new questions about the nature of the mind and the world itself.

B0000C8AUO|4.0|. . . unless, of course, you're a die-hard fan. Not bad, but for the average fan it's not worth paying the extra bucks to get it.<br /><br /> More than a few people, including me, have been somewhat disappointed in Bowie's last few albums (HOURS, HEATHEN) [note - I have since come to appreciate HOURS much more since I wrote this and now rate it highly - see my review], so it took me a while to get around to picking this one up (as a dedicated fan since hearing \\"Space Oddity\\" as a small child on my tiny radio in the middle of the night I was bound to get it eventually). Oh man, am I glad I did! REALITY turns out to be a classic, easily ranking among his best albums of all time.<br /><br />The band playing on REALITY boasts an all-star ensemble of Bowie veterans including uber-pianist Mike Garson and guitarist Earl Slick. The effort and dedication Bowie invested in this record is evident in the high quality songs and the fact that he plays guitar, keyboards, stylophone, synths, percussion and baritone sax! Anyone paying attention knows that Bowie's stellar musicianship has continually evolved over the years, especially in the past decade.<br /><br />Breakdown! (my impressions of REALITY) -<br /><br />\\"New Killer Star\\" - slinky guitar splashes mingle with futuristic propulsion and a driving rhythm; a very strong track that announces Bowie's songwriting ability is in full effect. Overflows with an intoxicating optimism. *****+<br /><br />\\"Pablo Picasso\\" - a lush, surrealistic take on Jonathan Richmond's proto-punk classic, and it totally rocks! *****<br /><br />\\"Never Get Old\\" - one of REALITY's best songs, it magnificently addresses one of Bowie's major preoccupations - (never) getting old. A true \\"rage against the dying of the light\\" though Bowie's clearly got a lot of life left in him. *****+<br /><br />\\"The Loneliest Guy\\" - hauntingly beautiful, this is prime Bowie at his most atmospheric and mellow. He sounds like he's trying to convince himself everything is going great even though the song's tone is quite melancholy. *****<br /><br />\\"Looking for Water\\" - a desperate-sounding rocker with Bowie's voice, still in top form, writhing in turmoil. The song seems to evoke an anarchic future in which drinkable water is scarce. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"She'll Drive the Big Car\\" - very cool mid-tempo rocker loaded with overdubbed Bowie harmonies. ****<br /><br />\\"Days\\" - absolutely gorgeous track and most likely a love song to his wife Iman. Exquisite. *****<br /><br />\\"Fall Dog Bombs the Moon\\" - an interesting song with intruguing lyrics which I find to be ultimately inscrutable. The weakest track here, it still isn't bad. ***<br /><br />\\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" - an absolutely soaring, magical George Harrison cover. It's a fantastic love - and life - song. *****+<br /><br />\\"Reality\\" - the hardest rocker in the bunch and another song that struggles with the artist's inevitable death. ****<br /><br />\\"Bring Me the Disco King\\" - don't get turned off by the campy title - this may be the best cut on the album. The jazzy, meditative shuffle is stark and sensuous. Bowie reminds us why he's recorded with the likes of Bing Crosby and ______ (insert favorite kickass collaboration here). This fantastic modern lounge track gives Frank Sinatra some post-mortum competition - but it's much more than that and way better in my view. *****+<br /><br />bonus disk -<br /><br />\\"Fly\\" - guided by a driving synth riff and strange synth sirens, this is a pretty cool song about flying but basically B-side quality. ***<br /><br />\\"Queen Of All The Tarts (Overture)\\" - This is another synth-dominated track which features a pulsing bass and surging orchestral peaks which compliment Bowie's repeated line - \\"Queen of all the tarts.\\" Is this the intro for some discarded album idea? It's well-produced and has some interesting tempo changes, but ultimately it feels like an incomplete song. ***3/4<br /><br />\\"Rebel Rebel\\" - yet another version of the old classic. This one begins with quiet tension before exploding into \\"hard rock land.\\" The song ends with a short detour into \\"trippy space land.\\" Not exactly revelatory but very cool. I always like \\"Rebel.\\" ****1/4<br /><br />Original album - 5-stars, highly recommended<br />This release - not recommendedlatory but very cool. I always like \\"Rebel.\\" ****1/4    Original album - 5-stars, highly recommended  This release - not recommended
0307454541|5.0|I was completely unprepared for this novel. I had seen it on bestseller lists and read magazines where the reviewers were completely wild over it. I thought the book couldn't possibly live up to the hype. I even thought, with dread, that it may just be some sort of Twilight hysteria thing. As usual, I was completely wrong.<br /><br />This novel is set in Sweden and you jump in to an immediately fast paced plot, with lots of twists and surprises. It's a mainstream novel now, but is surprisingly deep. It touches on journalism and ethics, business and economic theories, and then builds in an in-depth family mystery with a huge cast of characters. You can trust no one, and you can't even pretend to know what happens next.<br /><br />Great plot aside, the novel introduces two very intriguing characters. Most people seem to love Lisbeth, and she is unique, sassy, resourceful and tough. But I actually found the journalist Mikael even more interesting and deep. He's not your typical \\"lead\\" male detective: while he is an obvious ladies man, he is also a good friend. He can keep a secret, and he isn't pushy or demanding. He sets up situations in order to see how a character responds, and is still shocked and distressed by the horrors that occur. In some ways he is almost child-like in his innocence, and yet by way of his business history he is not naïve. He appears to have money and status but needs neither to exist: he's simple and direct without having any affectations.<br /><br />Part of the genius (yes, I said genius!) is that the novel works from both of their viewpoints, and lets each of their personalities exist, rather than one character simply assessing the other and defining them to the reader.<br /><br />That being said, I was surprised at some of the turns the novel took in that some main characters that are referred to heavily are never fleshed out, and some of the situations that took place (mostly involving illegal wiretapping and computer hacking) were so easily done without incident, too easily and quickly to be believable. Some of the precursors to extraordinary events unfolded with crisp writing and suspense, but the denouement seemed choppy.<br /><br />My suggestion to any reader of it would be to turn the pages slowly and savor it, because you'll be so sorry to see it end. You'll also want to be sure to install heavy duty encryption on your computer as soon as possible, and you'll never read another article in The Economist in the same way again.

B002VECM6S|4.0|This is a film with a story that is perpetually on the brink of pathos and a sop to white guilt over the position of a huge number of African-Americans in American society. The phrase \\"white guilt\\" even comes up in the film. There is no question that you can't avoid thinking about these things when confronted by a film about a wealthy white family taking in an exceptionally poor, socially unsupported black kid and raising him through his high school years. Let's set all that aside for a second. The film tells a story about people caring about other people and those who can helping someone else who needs it. And we all can't help but love rags to riches stories. Especially if they have a basis in fact.<br /><br />The political aspects of this film have generated a huge amount of controversy. The story of a white family helping a black kid is bound to stir controversy. There are so many issues raised by this that I won't even start to get into that. I think people will bring their own politics to a viewing of the film, so it will serve as a Rorschach test. I see it as an indictment of society at large and the almost complete lack of opportunity for a huge number of very poor blacks. I see Michael Oher as an exception, a kid who got very lucky because of the compassion of one family in a position to help. Conservatives will see this as a validation of private largess, while I see the opposite, with virtually no one willing to do what the Tuohy's did. Not many people will get breaks like Michael did.<br /><br />I'm happy for Sandra Bullock. I've always liked her, but have watched her career with a sense of horror. She has turned down some roles in pictures that were successful, while she has been in a long string of clunkers. This was easily her best role since . . . SPEED? Many of her best roles actually came from before SPEED, in small supporting performances. Of the top box office actresses of her era, she may have the worst group of movies on her resume. I also like that she is another of an increasing number of actresses to continue to enjoy success after turning 40. It is great to see her have such great success after so many stinky movies.<br /><br />As an Arkansas fan (and therefore an SEC fan) I got a kick out of seeing former Arkansas coaches Lou Holtz (who was fired for his awkward handling of racial tensions on the team, stupidly making a commercial endorsing racist North Carolina senator Jesse Helms when the Arkansas program was being torn apart by accusations of racial insensitivity on the team--and what could be racially less sensitive than making a commercial for that old hate monger) and Houston Nutt (fired due to stupidity of some Arkansas fans who created an untenable atmosphere -- not that I don't enjoy the current Arkansas coach). There is a funny moment where Houston Nutt, as the Arkansas head coach, notices that Leigh Anne is holding an Ole Miss cup. That is funny because when fan pressure drove Nutt out of his job at Arkansas, he became the head coach at Ole Miss. Speaking of Arkansas, Michael Oher should have gone there. Darren McFadden and Felix Jones might have been even more productive. Well, maybe not. I'm not sure how either of them could have done much more than they did. Oher did end up playing for Houston Nutt. Interestingly, I am pretty sure that all of the coaches who appeared in the film are now actually at other schools or out of football entirely.<br /><br />I have to point out that a couple of actors from one of my all time favorite TV series, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, were in THE BLIND SIDE. The boy who played the irrepressible S.J., Jae Head, played the equally irrepressible Bo in Season One of FNL, a little boy who idolized Tim Riggins. And Kim Dickens, who played the teacher who first recognized that Michael Oher was smarter than many assumed, played Matt Saracen's Mom in Seasons Three and Four.nother of an increasing number of actresses to continue to enjoy success after turning 40.

0307266303|4.0|Great book.  I particulary loved the sections describing the racing.   Also, the theory behind barefoot running was fascinating. After being to numerous doctors during my own running days, it was refreshing to hear some solid facts about the benefits of just running barefoot (or as the Tarahumara - in sandels).  I did have one complaint. One chapter was way too involved, and I can't remember which chapter it was, but what a waste of time. I read it, but regrettably.
0307454541|4.0|So I'm not going to lie- about 200 pages in I thought I was going to give up and chuck it out the window. It's hard to follow and has more characters and subplots than any feasible human can keep up with. The Vagner family- which plays an integral role in the plot- is huge with an extensive web of relationships. Where do these people think they're from? Kentucky? (that comment is slightly ominous, but read it to find out why).<br />Once you settle past enough exposition to make you feel like you're reliving the entire Obama campaign (which, in my mind started in 2004 at the DNC), it's actually quite an engaging read. The premise is strikingly simple despite the complexity of the set-up. Harriet Vagner has been missing for over four decades and a journalist- recently discredited in a libel indictment- has been hired to write the Vagner family biography and see if he can solve the mystery of Vagner's murder or disappearance. Now that I'm writing this, this kind of sounds like an absurdist Eastern European version of Jason Glass's life, which arguably got more popular once it was discovered his work was rooted in as much truth as a Harry Potter novel.<br />The author could do a slightly better job clarifying exactly what is going on at times, but about midway through the text, I was hooked. It's a great read at that point and had a hard time putting it down.
B000FSME1A|3.0|This would be a 5 star, except for one thing.  Each movie is spilt between two discs!  So no matter which version you watch, you have to stop halfway and take out disc one and insert disc two, to continue watching.  Obviously there is enough room on the discs that they could have put each movie on a separate disc.  Poor planning and somewhat irritating with a movie that is as mesmorizing at this one it.  Disrupts your concentration big time!

B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is one heck of a video! Joe is a very talented player and showman. This video has the energy to send chills down your spine, even if you have never heard Joe play before! Check out his album (My favorite from him) \\"You and Me\\" also.<br /><br />So far, most music this mellinium has been stale, fake, and just down right crappy, with few exceptions. Joe Bonamassa has got to be the biggest of these exceptions. Where most pop stars today dont write their own music, either written by \\"professional\\" writers or they rip off and \\"remix\\" someone elses song, with the exception of a couple tribute covers, Joe is all origional! Songs written by him on a long flight, or drive, on the road, or in some lonely hotel room somewhere. Where many pop stars have faceless session musicians play the instruments, Joe and his band are all live and in your face and with great tallent, all of them. Many pop stars use computerized pitch correction to make them sing on key, when Joe starts singin, its all Joe.<br /><br />A lot of popular rock bands today are busy writing sappy love ballads, bubble gum/coffee shoppe rock, or bouncing around on stage in rubber halloween masks, unfortunatly, this is what gets you radio play and sells t-shirts.It's not about the music, its about how much money can be made or marketing it. Joe and the boys are pure rock and blues, no gimmicks, they dare to just do what they do. Their have their own style and sound. Unfortunatly for them, you arent very likely to hear their awesome music on the radio, or while walking down the isles of the supermarket or find their T-shirts sold at the mall department stores. But as people discover Joe, and pass on his incredible music to friends and family, people will rediscover the magic of great tallent, craftsmenship, and artistry of really good quality music!<br /><br />Although I would not directly compair any of these guys with anyone else, as they are all gods in their own right, Joe is certainly this generations', Clapton, Hedrix, or SRV! Give him a listen, and pass it on!

B002BWQ6H6|5.0|There are a few novels that I have read in my lifetime that I wish I could have been the one to write it. Let the Great World Spin is one of them. The novel stayed with me for weeks after reading it.  It is hard not to think of the movie Crash while reading it. I love how the author merges all of the characters in the novel, and a plot element that does not seem important ends up being just as important as all of the others.
076790592X|5.0|This book is one of the most inspirational book on life I have ever read. It was released in 2002 but I just read it a month ago. This book is a philosophical insight about life written with simple rudimentary English language that every person can understand. If you want a perspective on the meaning of life, read this book.
0439023491|3.0|I will start by saying the story is well written in terms of prose, description, and strength of plot. However, I feel the novel lacks enough dialogue to keep the reader interested. There are times where the book trails off for pages without a single piece of dialogue. I start feeling a bit nauseous being in Katniss' head all the time. I also have a hard time connecting with Katniss as she seems to be a bit cold to emotion (toward Peetna or Gabe). I wish there were stronger feeling between the characters and definitely more character dialogue.

1416914307|5.0|Cassandra Clare has a gift for creating characters that feel real and relevant to readers. Each character has a fantastically unique personality that provides a wonderful color to the story. The dialogue is witty, smart, and at times, intensely intimate. The City of Glass is the third book in the Mortal Instruments series. I found a love/hate relationship with the ending to shawdowhunter trilogy. On the one hand, the author clears up (in detail) all the mysteries of Clare and Jayce's past. But on the other hand, the ending leaves the reader a bit empty and craving more. My favorite scenes are those involving Clare and Jayce. The scene outside Wayland manor is so steamy it will make the reader's heart skip a beat. However, compared to the previous two books, I feel as if there was not enough interaction between the main protagonists. After all, Clare and Jayce's love story is one of the main central plot points of the series and I couldn't help but feel it was overshadowed by the many subplots the author tries to tie up. I also felt a bit shorted on the scene in which Clare walks in on Jayce and another female shadowhunter. By shorted I mean that I had expected Clare to be a bit more furious at the sight of Jayce with another woman, but rather she walks away broken and defeated. I always thought of her as a stronger, more self-confident young woman which led me to want more \\"fight\\" out of her during that scene. I also found it strange that after three books, when Clare and Jayce are finally reunited, the author gives us no more than a couple pages describing their reunion before putting the star-crossed lovers at a table with friends to watch fireworks. I would much rather have had Clare and Jayce walk off together alone to watch the fireworks thereby having a longer reunion scene. The faerie queen scene in the epilogue seemed to have no point unless it was to set-up an opening for a future story line (even though this was accomplished when Sebastian's body was neverfound).  I want more Clare and Jayce - their love/hate (i use the word \\"hate\\" here loosely) relationship is what I love most about the series.  I was hoping the author would continue with another trilogy where we get to explore the lovers together as shadowhunters. Unfortunately, it seems as though the author is committed to a prequel (which usually are never a success because who wants to go back in time - we love THESE characters), but was slightly relieved to hear that there will be a fourth book albeit with the perspective of Simon's story. Here's to hoping that Clare and Jayce have a significant role in that novel.  Overall, I am left wanting more only because I love this series and I'm sad to see it end.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I saw this movie at my local theater and at first I enjoyed it but later on in the film I was not pleased with what I saw for a number of reasons.     First of all as a Sci-fi film it should have a lot of action scenes. This movie had only one battle scene at the end that lasted for about 10 to 20 minutes.     Secondly the film portrayed the marines as stupid, heartless, family killers.     The main character was a traitor to the marines.    It dragged on and on and was boring and redundant.     The natives to the planet had a religion that closely resembled the Force.    The movie was a big promotor of environmentalism.    The movie resembled the Vietnamn war.     I did not like this film. Do not go to the Theater and do not by the DVD, but atmost rent it.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|I'll be brief. While I loved the original production of CRANFORD, I couldn't get into RETURN TO CRANFORD because I never got past the fact that the actresses looked like frumpy women dressed in straight-off-the-rack period-piece costumes. In short, this seemed an inauthentic and uninspired production and a waste of exceptional talent. When I wish to return to Cranford, I'll watch the wonderful original, thank you very much.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Being a long time horror fan, I was enticed by the hype of the so called \\"Scariest Movie of All Time\\" moniker that was being thrown around in reference to \\"Paranormal Activity\\".  Is it correct?  Not quite, but the film still offers its own fair share of scares and thrills.  The film begins by showing the audience the basic daily lives of the two main (and basically only) actors of the film.  The audience is told that the couple has been experiencing a lot of night terrors recently, ranging from crashes and bumps, to more drastic and major events as well. To finally put an end to this, Micah decides to capture every moment of their daily lives on video.  He begins to carry around a camera in hopes of catching the haunting in action.<br /><br />The audience sees Micha's and Katie's lives in real-time as events are actually occurring.  The real thrills don't begin until the night scenes however.  During the night, Micha places the camera on a tripod in the corner of the room.  During the first few nights the audience is treated to thumps, crashes, doors opening on their own, and lights flickering.  The hauntings become worse with each night and as the hours progress.  Micha begins to infuriate the spirit even further through his constant provoking actions.  This makes the audience feel tense as to how the spirit will act, especially since the events are occurring in real-time.  The angrier the spirit gets, the more violent the hauntings become, even leading to eventual day-time hauntings.  What was once simple \\"bumps\\" and other noises transform into violent attacks against the couple.  A simple poltergeist reveals itself as a demon.<br /><br />The camera is always placed in the perfect corner of the room, allowing the audience to view footprints, shadows, and other events as they occur.  What adds to the suspense is the fact that the spirit gradually becomes worse as time goes by.  The pacing is done extremely well, building suspense with each passing night.  This contributes greatly to the overall scare factor of the film.  The last few nights of the film are filled with so much suspense and terror that the build up going into the scenes alone is enough to justify chills.  I felt as if I could actually feel the aggression of the demonic spirit with its every action.  Truly suspenseful.<br /><br />Maybe I have been desensitized to horror movies, seeing how the horror genre has always been my personal favorite and having a collection of over 100 horror films, but I still cannot call it the \\"Scariest Film of All Time\\".  However, the film offers enough scares and suspense for me to say that it is truly remarkable and definitely worth checking out if you're looking for good scares.to the overall scare factor of the film.

0547258305|4.0|Plot Summary:  It's hard to imagine a slight young woman functioning as the enforcer for a King, but in this fantasy world, Lady Katsa is known for her Grace to kill, torture and maim.  She hates the fear that her striking eyes inspires (one is blue and one is green), and she hates her King, so Katsa tries to do good through an informal network of friends called the Council.  On a council mission to rescue a kidnapped old man, Katsa encounters a Graced fighter who might finally be her match.  Prince Po is searching for his grandfather, and he somehow knows that Katsa is someone he can trust, despite her deadly reputation.    I was conscious that Graceling was a young adult novel for the first half, but then by the second half I was completely caught up in the story.  I think anyone who enjoys Maria V. Snyder's fantasies would feel at home in Kristin Cashore's world, and yes, it was definitely good enough for me to recommend it to adult fantasy fans too.  There was just enough of everything to keep me happy, between the adventure, the fight scenes, and the romance.  Ms. Cashore was rather kind too, to tie up the ending so that her readers aren't left hanging, but the `why' behind this became clear to me when I saw how her sequel plays out (more on that below).    This style of fantasy is easily accessible to all kinds of readers, and I think that's a big part of its appeal.  I particularly liked the concept behind the Gracelings, people who are gifted with one power, and how both Katsa and Po had hidden depths to their particular Grace.  It's like being a superhero back in the time of horses, swords, and sailing ships.      The second book in the series, [[ASIN:0803734611 Fire (Graceling)]], isn't really a sequel but a companion prequel to the series, since it's set 30 years before the events in Graceling.  According to Ms. Cashore's website the third book is tentatively titled Bitterblue, and it will be set six years after Graceling left off.  There's no release date yet, but she said we can expect it to tell Bitterblue's story, and yes, Katsa and Po will play some part.

On his next job Simon is hired by the Russian Mafia to steal a cold fusion energy formula from scientist Emma Russel, however the mission backfires as he falls for the pretty, intelligent scientist. Simon and his new love must now manage to outwit the Russian Mafia and work out the energy formula before the worst happens and the US is affected forever. I liked this movie. Not as \\"The Saint\\" but as an elaborate action movie with a twist. Val Kilmer bears nothing in him that even gets close to Roger Moore's character, but if you look away from that and try to see it as an ordinary movie, it's really good.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|The CD has the Norah Jones sound for sure, however, not all the songs are as appreciated as some of her earlier tunes.

B00004Y87O|5.0|Due to huge crime rates, the United States turns its once great city of New York into a maximum security prison where hardcore criminals are put for life. All the bridges leading into the city are mined, a large wall is built along the shoreline and a large police force army is based there to stop or kill any attempted escapees. En route to a conference, the President, on board Air Force One, is forced to eject in a pod when a female terrorist takes over the controls and crashes the plane into a building. A new prisoner, ex-soldier Snake Plissken is offered his freedom if he goes in, frees the President and finds a tape with important information for the conference. Snake agrees but to ensure his co-operation he is injected with a small but powerful explosive that will only be destroyed if his mission is successful. Snake must set out into the decaying city, filled with immoral criminals, and he must succeed for his own life. This movie moves at a brisk pace and the dark lighting carries the sense of mystery, isolation, and destruction. Kurt Russell is excellent. This movie has a great atmosphere and Carpenter's score perfectly sets the mood. I enjoyed it.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|How can you even begin to describe the brilliance, talent and surprises that are Dexter: Season 4??  Mere words do it no justice.  You want to run out and tell everyone who isn't watching it to sit down and pull up a chair.  Each season has it's own flavor, some a little less palatable than others but I always enjoyed the show.  Season 4 is just out of the park good.  John Lithgow is so amazing as the Trinity Killer (not a spoiler) but the depth of his madness goes so deep its unlike anything Dexter could even imagine for himself.  The interaction with his family and slowly revealing the true story was brilliantly told. The \\"Hungry Man\\" episode (also known as the Thanksgiving episode) is hands down the best episode of the entire series.  I have never been on the edge of my seat from beginning to end of an episode like I was with that one.  Just as you think the finale is going to be a little on the disappointing side, you're hit with the final scene.  All Dexter fans know that the lid has been blown off and the rulebook is out the window as far as what kind of man we're going to see coming into season 5.  All I know is I can't wait to watch!

Tom Cruise is excellent as Ethan, Vanessa Redgrave makes a superb villian. Sure it's not the T.V. series, but if you enjoy plots that put your wit to test, then Mission Impossible I is the right movie for you. II and III are also good.
B002CAWNEM|2.0|I liked this movie a lot better in 1987 when it was called \\"Fatal Attraction.\\" Beyonc&eacute; Knowles was a HUGE disappointment. She may have the singing voice of a shrieking angel, but her speaking voice is atrocious. She speaks like some sort of gutter rat throughout the film.  She also a terribly bland \\"actress\\".  Idris Elba plays an honorable husband who also happens to be a clueless moron. Jerry O'Connell plays an annoying, useless moron. The real scene-stealer is Ali Larter, she plays a crazy b**ch Glenn Close would be proud of. Beyonc&eacute; does manage to redeem herself at the end, but you kind of saw it coming a mile away.

Her sister enrolls her in on-line dating and includes the description of \\"must love dogs.\\" She loves dogs but doesn't own one of her own, so she borrows her brother's dog to meet Jake Anderson at the dog park; he, too, had to borrow a dog. It's a hit-and-miss beginning but could true love wag its tail for these two. Must Love Dogs is a familiar yet enjoyable romantic comedy that should keep you entertained.

After graduating from Emory University, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Along the way, Christopher encounters a series of characters who shape his life. This movie is  beautiful, deep, true, adventurous, sad, occasionally funny, real, at times very touching. Chris McCandless lived a whole, remarkable, life. And Sean Penn has captured those two years for all to see in this movie.
B0013XS8A2|1.0|After the masterpieces in the seventies, and some of the fine work (QE2, Five Miles Out, Crises, Amarok) Oldfield gave us in the 80's, we remain hopeful, even vigilant, that a truly innovative work might still be within his grasp.    At some point, Mike has morphed into the Andre Rieu, the Thomas Kincaid, the Boris (not Frazetta) of popular music. This is product, kitsch, from a composer whose influence once cast an enormous shadow over pop/rock.    What was once exhilarating and exciting has become repetitive and trite.    Mikey, we hardly knew ye.

On the way to visit Arthur she has a chance meeing with the free-spirited and bohemian Lancelot, to whom she finds herself attracted. This movie is an adaptation of the myth of Arthur, and is interesting. The performances by Connery, Ormond and Gere are very good. First Knight is a great movie, and one you should not miss. It's a simple story that doesn't require a lot of analysis or understanding of the story and mythology to enjoy.
0312360266|1.0|I picked up this book to read thinking it would be entertaining, but it wasn't. I found it very offensive because it is all anti-Christian, or any religion believing in God. Did the author have to GO there in order to write a good book? No. It would have been far better to let the reader make up their own mind about the issues being presented.
B001GCUO4S|4.0|I bought this dvd and it came with 3-d glasses.  I was really excited about watching this movie in 3-d.  But, when I put the glasses on, I couldn't tell it was in 3-d.  It was like they threw in the 3-d glasses, but the movie wasn't in 3-d.  So, I took off the glasses and watched the movie normal.  I thought the movie was good.  It was fast paced and everything happened so fast.  Nice special effects.  Okay, I just figured out I had to turn the stupid disc over for 3-d.  I wish somewhere in the dvd, it would had said that.  I watched some of the movie in 3d and it looks great!  I guess I'll have to watch it again in 3d!
0375836675|5.0|I thought that this book had a wonderful plot that was interesting from the very beginning. What I liked the most about \\"I am the Messenger\\" was that it made me think a little bit and I loved the way the main character had such a good heart underneath all the tough layers.

Krug not only tells Why we should strive to not make people think when they come to our websites, but he also shares and summarizes years of his own primary research.<br /><br />I'm a learner so I really enjoyed the theory of usability with credentialed authoritative resources. but I also love to take action and Krug also gives steps to take and a clear path of things to do and not do to make your site more usable and you visitors less likely to push the back button.<br /><br />Just under 200 pages, \\"[[ASIN:0321344758 Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, 2nd Edition]]\\" has found its way onto a coveted spot within my key resource books on my desk.

B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Got this as a gift for a friend and we all ended up enjoying it. Great for fans of the graphic novel and a must see for fans of the movie-rendition.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|3.7 stars<br /><br />From reviews here I expected some hidden masterpiece. I respect Mamet and the two leads, so I couldn't wait to see this. Unfortunately, Mamet's script hampered my enjoyment of the glorious locales.<br /><br />The problem for me is that the dialogue is far too stagey and theatrical at times. Hopkins and Baldwin are both very solid here, but their words often feel fake, especially when spoken against these most authentic wilderness backdrops. It all seems too pontificating at times, and the film was suspenseful only when they were fighting the bear. But even then, it was laughably theatrical; no way Hopkins kills that bear that quickly with a suddenly fashioned perfect spear. No way!<br /><br />Still, there is lots of eye candy for nature lovers, and the occasional bon mot from Mamet, who is after all a very fine wordsmith. But I couldn't ever really let go into this movie; whenever I was about to, another out of place line would issue forth and I'd feel like I was watching a Broadway play, with all its inherent artifice, in the wilderness. And while that may sound interesting, it left me stuck between the two worlds and unable to enjoy either to the fullest.
B002UJIY7A|4.0|The Perfect Getaway is an enjoyable adventure thriller with a great setup and a great twist as well, set in beautiful Hawaii. The film did a pretty good job of setting everything up while not necessarily making you aware of the twist. I suspect the events are mostly consistent, with perhaps a few liberties taken. Anyway it's a great premise to start the movie, it's fun to watch as events unfold, the intrigue and creepy thriller aspects gradually grow darker, the characters are interesting enough, and I thought the twist was about as well executed as could be. Yes you can figure it out if you really try, but unless you've seen spoilers most people will not really be *sure* what's going on for quite some time, even if you have some guesses. Again, I thought it was pretty well done and I usually guess these things way in advance.<br /><br />I thought the end of the movie could have added something more, but overall it was good solid fun and I would watch it again just to see how it looks when you know what's going on from the beginning. [Edit: On further reflection, the ending gets more interesting. When you consider the twist, and some of the things that Steve Zahn's character says near the end (and in previous sequences) it almost seems like some kind of double-twist or reversal of the original twist might have occurred during the ending sequence, if you think about it. Probably not... but I'm not entirely sure without rewatching the whole thing].<br /><br />On the gore level: there is some gore, but it's nothing extreme and is limited to a few scenes. I could have gone without a couple of the scenes but they did kind of set the tone so maybe they were necessary.<br /><br />I can't give it five stars because it's not perfect, but it is very good and I recommend it.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|4.6 stars<br /><br />I love this flick, and think both the script and Ford do justice to the original, justifiably beloved tv series. I don't think this blu-ray transfer does much justice to the original print, though; while it's a good, crisp picture, it's not much of an improvement over my dvd.<br /><br />The film itself is an excellent adaptation of the series, and the Big Pharma conspiracy angle is an excellent updating that works well. There's thrills aplenty, with minimal violence, which I appreciate more every year as idiot directors and writers rely on guns and blood to fill the holes in their ill-planned plots. There's more intelligence than that at work here, and director Andrew Davis makes it all mesh tightly and suspensefully. The ending is a bit weak: I don't buy the scene at the conference, but it works to the degree it must, and that's good enough.<br /><br />Add Ford and Jones at the top of their games and it's a movie worth watching many times, whenever one needs to be reminded what a truly fine thriller can be.<br /><br />Too bad they didn't polish it up enough for it to be a blu-ray worthy of the description high-def.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Paranormal Activity, for many mysterious, for others fiction and for the less fortunate, an experience. This film, feeling more like a documentary (and a very well imaginative creation) had many people talking about it, in fact calling it one of the scariest films in recent time. I experienced doubt at first for some reason, and now I am deploring for not watching it at the movies.  For those who enjoy getting frightened and alarmed, this movie was made just for you, and for those who oppose the previous mentioned symptoms, be prepared because this will scare your wits off!<br /><br />It does have a Blair Witch Project and Quarantine taste to it, but believe me, this one will make you think twice  before turning off the lights and going to bed. If any sort of paranormal phenomena or event has ever intrigued you, this is the movie you should get your hands on. You will not even believe what activity this poor couple will have to endure.<br /><br />I just finished watching Paranormal Activity and I am very pleased and startled at the same time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this DVD a few weeks ago. I am a former military member and I don't remember basic training being this hard. You will probably feel sick and want to die the first time you do level one because I know I did. You do get used to it after the second or third time. I kept myself from weighing in every day and cut it down to once a week. I also measured parts of my body where I want to slim down. I didn't lose weight right away but I did remeasure myself after a week and I lost from 1/2 to 3/4\\" in most areas. I am no longer getting asked \\"Are you pregnant\\" anymore and I am more toned. The trick is to drink water and stay away from sugary drinks. Also, I went to WebMD and used the meal planner and created my daily meals so I can stay within my calorie limits. You have to fight for that body! Also, doing the workout with music only helps--when I hear voices talking to me it breaks my concentration. It is an awesome workout, especially for the price!
0385504225|4.0|It's always amusing to read how some people can take Dan so serious. He's a fiction writer. Problem is that in a world where logical thinking is not taught in school anymore, people really can't distinguish where Dan takes a left. And another, and another.   Sure, he made a couple of back handed swipes at my personal beliefs, but much of his message is agreeable.     But, on to the story. The characters were plausible for the most part. As usual some parts of the story just did not line up. The plot itself was kind of silly, but Dan has a way of building up expectation so when the bomb is dropped you feel like it must be important. The bad guy always takes you by surprise, unless you understand how Dan likes to twist the end by dangling it in front of you the whole time.     The wrap-up of the story serves more as an apology to everyone he offended during the story. Apology accepted.
B002VECLVY|5.0|George is a single man in several ways.  He is not married, he is gay, and his partner of many years has recently died.  \\"A Single Man\\" is also a reference to George's position, as he perceives it, vis a vis the rest of the world.  Since his partner's death, George is detached, aloof.  He slides through life without engaging in it, and finds himself enveloped in a private cocoon of sorrow and despair.  The film follows George through one very important day in his life:  the day on which he decides whether or not to die.  It's a lot like \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" and the its adaption \\"The Hours\\" in that respect.  The film is dreamlike, disjointed with sudden flashbacks, yet gentle in its treatment of what is doubtless a damaged psyche.  George is often indifferent to his surroundings, but occasionally has moments of intense clarity.  Indulgently slow closeups of utterly mundane moments showcase details so delicious they practically leap off the screen:  a young girl's blue patterned dress, a dog's muzzle caressing George's porous cheek, the smile of a pretty young receptionist.  In these moments George seems to recapture what was once a meaningful life, or perhaps he is simply remembering the life he once had.  This nostalgia is manifested in his relationship with his longtime friend Charley (Moore), with whom he shares such a tangled past that neither can seem to escape it.  Firth and Moore give outstanding performances, and Matthew Goode and Nicholas Hoult have strong supporting roles.  The movie is about the value of life, a life, the life of a man struggling to find meaning in loss, as we all do.  Shelf your expectations before viewing this one.  Despite the dark theme of this movie, after seeing it I felt much more alive.
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I owned this album back in the 70's and bought the 1989 remaster in hopes that the sound would be better. As with Court of the Crimson King, the soft parts were too low in volume and the dynamic parts were too loud. Jon Andersons voice on Prince Rupert's Lament were entirely too low in volume and muddy. It was dissappointing because these two albums are just brilliant! Finally! I can't say enough about the new mix and especially the Digital 5.1 Surround. This new release is the way I always knew it should sound. Balanced, brillant and clear. I highly recommend it.

He took his time building it and enjoyed the process.  The instruction manual was put together in one big binder which was nice.  The set is pricey but well worth it, we found the best price through Amazon.  Finished Death Star is sturdy.

Surprisingly Ben Affleck Did A Great Portrayal of Matt Murdoch/Daredevil. and Collin Farrell As \\"Bullseye\\" is really good too. The Director's cut is just Coolio Added as a Story which could explain alot. Both versions are good. Buy both.

1603420398|5.0|Beautiful book, but even better, well written, and full of useful information.  I liked that the pictures were made of plain, easy to see yarn, but some show off pics of some finished projects would have been nice too.  I loved the layout ideas pages, and all the unusual shapes.  I would buy this for anyone who already loves to crochet, its a little advanced for beginners.<br /><br />The large pictures, and spiral binding make this very useful for using while you are working and trying to learn to use the patterns and motifs.  A nice \\"lap size\\" as well, the typeset is large enough I can easily read it laying on my lap with no eye strain.  Nice closeups of starting and finishing points, as well as many tips for changing colors cleanly. Many tips and suggestions for making even increases and decreases, to get flat rather than cupped or ruffled finished items, corner treatments, and much much more.  I love this book! I already own over 2 dozen crochet books and still consider the stuff in this one to be worth the price.
0792164903|4.0|This is very far from the original by Washington Irving, so far that it is really a completely different work of art.  While in the original Icobod, is a kind of local twit of a teacher - pompous, lacking self awareness, ridiculously awkward - in this he is a big city \\"scientific\\" investigator who comes to the provincial town.  Moreover, Irving's tale never quite enters the supernatural, but instead is a parody that leaves much to the imagination.<br /><br />That being said, Depp creates a very good character:  a bit of a dork, but courageous in overcoming his fear.  THe atmosphere is as vivid and dense as one would expect from Burton, with excellent actors adding to it.  It is more of a traditional horror story that is tied off rather than left open, which I regretted.<br /><br />Recommended for fans.
B002ZOHVN8|4.0|Editors' 2005 debut album \\"The Back Room\\" was one of the most accomplished debut albums of the past decade (I call it the UK's answer to Interpol's stellar debut album). The 2007 album \\"An End Has A Start\\" had some good songs on it but overall flet like a rehash of the debut album's musical ideas, and not nearly as good. THat left the band with a dilemma on what to do next. Having seen the fork in the road, the band apparently decided to take a decided left turn, and emerges with a new sound.<br /><br />\\"In The Light and On The Evening\\" (14 tracks--including 5 bonus tracks; 67 min.) couldn't sound any different than the first two albums. The electric guitars have essentially been abandoned altogether, and instead a synthesizer sound (not unlike, say, Ultravox 25 years ago) is front and center. Check out the dark title track that opens the album. \\"Bricks and Mortar\\" (2nd UK single) and \\"Papillion\\" (1st UK single) follow in order. It's hard to see the commercial appeal of those songs, but as compared to the other songs on here, they are the 'catchiest' tracks on here. This is a mood album, pure and simple, and if you're in the proper mood, this will sound great. If you're looking for another serving of \\"The Back Room\\", you're going to be mightily disappointed, so, truly, buyer beware. The original album, released in the UK last October, ran 9 tracks. The US version comes with 5 bonus tracks (This House Is Full of Noice; I Want A Forest; A Life As a Ghost; Human; For the Money), all of which sound in the same vein as the regular albums tracks.<br /><br />I've seen Editors in concert a number of times in support of their first two albums, and singer Tom Smith always gives his 110%, whether he's playing guitsr or piano, seemingly getting lost in a world of his own. It will be very interesting to find out how the new songs will be brought live (I guess guitar-player Chris Urbanowicz will switch to keyboards?). Can't wait to see those guys again. Finally, if you wonder where you can hear Editors, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the best indie-music in the country, bar none, and where this album has been played regularly since its release.Editors, check out WOXY (BAM!

006112429X|5.0|My first impression of we need to talk about Kevin was that is must be a psuedo-psychologic tale of what sort of upbringing would result in a teenage boy engaging in a Columbine-type massacre.<br /><br />But much of this tale is playing on expectations, the author toys with blaise themes and cliche then throws them from a window to treat us to a hellish ride through a mother's life with a psychopathic child.<br /><br />Shriver, rides close to melodramic (I'm sure i've read some of of Kevin's horrible behaviours before, the author it seems has taken some nightmare of every possible senario and pushed them into this book) yet somehow brings us to tears with the realism of her story.<br /><br />Eva's narrative makes us feel horror, disgust, pity, frustration, hate and love. This book isn't a fact-list for what makes a serial killer, the author seems strongly in the nature camp, exemplified by the fact that its revealed from the beginning what he did, and his nature is obvious from the beginning.<br /><br />What this book is, is a exploration of the horror of family life with an eventual killer. Part facts of life, psychological thriller, parenting trials the book is impossible to put down.<br /><br />Even the slow, shrill and slightly boring beginning where we explore the married life of the parents before Kevin has its place. Everything about the book is important to understand the characters and to truly experience their lives.<br /><br />Its hard to find fault with this novel, it is a long read, which combined with the compulsion to finish it makes for many hours reading.<br /><br />The thought of why didn't the parents do something about Kevin sooner, enters the readers' heads but Eva explains herself, and I felt a strange empathy for Franklin, while I don't have a psychopathic child, I do understand that when family goes through something heavy, such as mental illness, denial is sometimes the only thing that gets one through.<br /><br />This is probably the only book that has actually made me 'think' (as in it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you think.

I knew as well that traveling down the road to self-respect my own white blood would never recede into mere abstraction. I was left to wonder what else I would be severing if and when I left my mother at some uncharted border.\\" (80).  Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance by the current President of the United States, Barack Obama, is a memoir that discusses the issues of drugs, civil rights, welfare and poverty, principles and values, and perhaps the most evident of all, race. It is set in various time periods and places throughout Obama's life, which includes his genesis in Hawaii, his time spent in Chicago, and his trip to his father's native Kenya.    Growing with a biracial heritage is something that many children struggle with when it comes to defining who they are. The process of coming to terms with one's world is what Obama experiences as he begins to understand the racism and bigotry prevalent in his early years. His beliefs as a ten-year-old metamorphose when he is in high school to viewing the world as many black youth of his time view it; as a world where white people have the power and control everything. Eventually, as he matures, his viewpoint of the world is at the point where he is able to understand his identity.    Barack Obama writes with such fluidity that it gives an impression to the reader that he or she is taken to a turbulent world seen through the eyes of a young boy through his years up until attending Harvard Law School. Obama keeps the story moving and often opens chapters with a different story from the previous chapter. However, the main ideas are still prevalent throughout the whole memoir, producing a feel of teleporting throughout times to parts of his life that are relevant to the main themes and engaging to reader.  From my perspective, I see this narrative as touching and pragmatic story of a boy becoming a man and finding his identity. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and had a black father who leaves him and a white mother who helps him become strong. Obama's autobiography is one that I will definitely list as one of my favorite books. It is one that I will continue to remember as I see the world around me change along with my view of it. Obama recalls his stepfather telling him, \\"Men take advantage of weakness in other men... Better to be strong. If you can't be strong, be clever and make peace with someone who's strong. But always better to be strong yourself. Always.\\" (37).   The notions of power, race, and other factors contribute to one's being because a person is a product of their environment. Barack Obama did not let his situation take hold of him and he made himself strong. This compelling autobiography is a must read and I rate it five out of five stars.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a staple in American Literature. Widely considered Kurt Vonnegut's greatest work, it tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a WWII soldier who was abducted by Tralfamadorian aliens and subsequently jumps through time. The reader goes along for the ride, jumping through different parts of Pilgrim's life on a nearly page by page basis.           The novel has two prevailing themes. At its core this is an antiwar book. Vonnegut says as much in the first chapter, but his second theme is both more original and more exciting. Vonnegut presents an interesting take on the concept of time. In his story events do not unfold in a linear fashion. According to the aliens of Tralfamador, all moments coexist at once, and our fates are all predetermined.          I realize that the science fiction genre does not appeal to everyone, but try not to get scared off by the aliens and time travel. This is not your typical science fiction novel. Vonnegut accomplishes a remarkable feat. He seamlessly blends historical events with fictitious and real characters all under the umbrella of a science fiction storyline. But the novel manages to avoid the sci-fi label, and it is taken seriously as a famed literary work that will appeal to almost anyone.          The writing is first-class, and Vonnegut is at once comical and dark. The somewhat simple language only serves to enhance his voice. The story is told from both a first and third person prospective with Vonnegut serving primarily as a narrator but often showing up as a character, leaving readers to wonder just how much of this story is actually true. Best of all this is an easy read and very quick. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a unique and rewarding reading experience.

What they have done with the story is really good, although you would have to already be an Evangelion fan to really grasp what is going on. I don't know why Amazon is saying the release date is later this year, I have had my copy for 4 months now. I highly recommend getting this and is a must have for any Neon Genesis Evangelion fan boy/girl.
0802130208|5.0|To set the stage for my review, imagine a burned out high school senior, entering his first year of college. Years of English classes have squeezed all possible fun out of reading, with their endless analyses, minute criticisms, and lofty pretensions-this was part of the reason I was going to be an engineering major. At the end of my first term, my roommate suggested that I read this, saying that it was the best book he had ever read. Now, up to this point, my approach on reading had been completely shattered. I would read all the little details, losing sight of the beauty of the novel-after all, there had to be a test at the end, right? However, A Confederacy of Dunces not only completely changed my world view, it revitalized my love of reading, something I'd been lacking since 8th grade. I can't be more thankful that I got my hands on this book, and I hope you get the same opportunity!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|As a huge fan i for sure love to see what Michael was up too the last weeks mths of his life, and was very much interested to see how much of a perfectionist he was with this, cause of all the fodder of him \\"he doesnt do it unless its perfect to the last detail\\" etc etc. Im so glad sony did this Cause i realized i would have to draw my own conclusion how MJ felt about THIS IS IT which is what im going to do here. i loved this basically instead of a few pics, you see MJ moving, dancing, singing, weeks before he is gone forever its surreal. i saw at the theater and when i get the DVD i will watch it over and over.      My conclusion, Michael wasnt IN to it. Feeling forced, I think thats why he probably thought 'well Im doing this cause I have too might as well try to make it good.' This DVD is 2 HOURS!!! Sony states, \\"its edited from over 100 HOURS of footage!\\" No doubt they took the ABSOLUTE VERY BEST from every single aspect of the footage to look like MJ is on his game. One thing I know after MJ died there was no doubt that Randy Phillips was scared I believe. What better way to show \\"oh look see we didnt force anyone to do anything, just look at him he wants to do it\\" then to pick the Best EDITED footage and put it out there for everyone. I dont care what Concert Promoters say. not this is signifcant detail, its reported MJ was 5'10 (although his mugshot says 5'11) and when he died no doubt he was 112lbs or possibly under thats almost 30lbs UNDERweight. Why on earth was he allowed to do this! Phillips, Ortega, and Travis Payne not that this would be his concern, knew how hard MJ worked is one of the few ppl that does out of this world dance moves and sings LIVE while doing it, why was he allowed to perform when there were times weeks before his death he didnt even feel like walking and was pushed in a wheel chair!         One strong point to this, anyone reading this is no doubt a fan of MJ so you know the last time he tourd, performed, had a concert, its been 12yrs i believe since a tour, 8yrs since an album was put out, and besides singing a song at an award show once or twice, it has been YEARS and YEARS since MJ was in Concert last. After ALL THIS TIME He finally, FINALLY decides to do a \\"big show, 50 concerts\\" he dies 7DAYS BEFORE leaving for this 50date series. No doubt \\"THIS\\" Affected him in way that I guess nobody knew.
0670021652|4.0|I received Eat, Pray, Love as a gift on my way to the hospital for a lumpectomy on Christmas Eve, 2009.  What a gift.  I devoured it, and then rushed out to purchase Committed and I have also devoured it.  While Committed is not as special in the same way, there are nuggets that are truly inspiring.  It caused me to re-evaluate my own 52 year marriage to my husband, who I married at age 19!  Perhaps i am just lucky, but it also caused me to see all my husband's good parts along with the annoying ones.<br /><br />I especially loved the parts of Committed telling the stories of Elizabeth's grandmother and her mother, as this is reflected in my own history. The Swedes! and the Scottish!  Oh, my!<br /><br />I would have loved more descriptions of the countries and places and lifestyle they were living in at that point in their travels.  Perhaps that is the novel that got dumped!<br /><br />But, as Elizabeth and Felipe were finally meeting at the airport (JFK) In January 2007,  I just lost it with my own sobbing for her final and most heart warming reunion with the man she<br />fought so hard for and won!  It made the whole somewhat technical read worthwhile, in my eyes!<br /><br />Surely our Homeland Security should be required to read this story!  They need to rethink their point in all of this!<br /><br />I will be wanting to read all of Elizabeths books now, especially non-fiction which is my favorite!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|Director Duncan Jones came up with a smart plot and a fine production with a low budget, but good enough to earn a place within the classics of the genre, and there is no question he intended a homage to [[ASIN:B00005ASUM 2001 - A Space Odyssey]]. Sam Rockwell delivers an outstanding performance, but unfortunately it is not possible to go into the details without spoiling the story for those that haven't seen it yet (just like telling how [[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense]] ends, so you got to see it).<br /><br />Despite the slow beginning, the story takes quite an unexpected turn (no spoiler again), and Jones delivers quite an interesting movie, with less than a dozen actors and without the need of fast action or breathtaking special effects. This is a US$5 million film and Jones choose to make limited used of digital special effects, so they built a real size prop in the studio for the entire interior of the lunar base, and the exterior lunar landscape and vehicles and equipment were shot using good old miniature models, complemented with just a bit digital imaginary. Considering this is technology from the 70s the end result is amazing, and quite a reminiscence of the TV series [[ASIN:B00006FD8P Space 1999]]. I watched the DVD version on a 50\\" flat screen, and it is unbelievable the movie has such good image and realism without the taking full advantage of the latest digital SFX technology. My only complaint has to do with the images of Earth in the Moon horizon. I think they could have been better, as they look like old NASA pictures.<br /><br />Together with [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9 ]] and [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar]], these flicks are the best of the 2009 sci-fi crop, and surely good candidates to become classics of the genre, so don't miss it. As usual, this kind of movies are not a commercial hit in the box-office (Moon barely covered its cost), so other than sci-fi buffs, I do recommend it also for lovers of good cinema in general. And finally for those curious about Duncan's previous work, the DVD version I bought came with a short film directed by him called \\"Whistle\\", interesting but not on par to \\"Moon\\".urious about Duncan's previous work, the DVD version I bought came with a short film directed by him called \\"Whistle\\", interesting but not on par to \\"Moon\\".

1401323820|5.0|OK, I liked the book, but I got to thinking about one of the main characters, Jameson Rook, he plays a journalist which compares to Richard Castle as writer.  If your a fan of the show you know about Castle and Rook is very much like him.  Anyway, as I was reading I got to thinking that a rook in chess is symbolized usually as a castle.  Rook=Castle, so that is my thinking for the day, I can go rest now.    About the book, it was awesome, when it first started I thought it a little corny in kind of a 40's detective story way, but it got better.  The writing is fast paced and it is a relatively short and easy read.  It reels you in and gets you thinking about who did it, which a good crime novel should.  The way most of it reads is so close to how the characters on the tv show interact, it makes you wonder if this was a cast-off script that was converted to book form.  Anyway, if you like the show you will like the book, I did.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|For the longest time, it has been argued that \\"The Godfather\\" (from the book and movie of the same title) is not about Vito Corleone but about Michael Corleone because it is about his ascent/descent into the underworld. And, at the very end, he is the godfather to Connie's son while his rivals are being executed. In the same respect, I had to wonder about who the real gangster is here: Frank Lucas (Washington) or Special Detective Truppo (Brolin). While we do watch Lucas' burgeoning success as a drug dealer, it is Truppo who acts with the viciousness of a gangster. He and his flock of black-jacketed, vulture-like crooked cops are more terrifying and brazen than Lucas. Lucas acts with compassion at times--even while burning an enemy alive in the opening sequence, he mercifully blasts him away before the flames can prolong his agony. In fact, any time he resorts to violence seems forced. Truppo has no compunction about saying things like \\"Maybe next time I throw you and your brother in the river.\\" In fact Truppo is a nemesis to both Lucas and Officer Roberts (Crowe). His malevolence is everywhere.<br /><br />Then, like \\"The French Connection\\" it is about the complex world of drug-trafficking and the frustrations of law enforcement to understand it--especially in the wild and wooly days of the late-60s to late-70s. Crowe does an exceptional job of expressing this frustration and confusion (he cannot believe that a Black man could do what the Italian Mafia could not--monopolize the drug trade in all five boroughs and then the outer counties, including New Jersey). To make matters worse, Roberts has to contend with the corruption in his own department.<br /><br />All this makes for a dark but engrossing film that leaves you impressed with director Scott's ability to recreate a world that has vanished a few decades ago, at least in appearance.<br /><br />So why not a perfect score? Two things: First, the prolonged scenes concerning Roberts' divorce are way too distracting. While I love looking at Carla Gugino, her thankless role in thankless scenes detract from the film's pacing. Second, the second disc--with its self-congratulatory nods to the costume designers, set designers, fried egg designers--really aren't worth watching. The only thing on that disc worth watching is the discussion between the real Frank Lucas and the real Richie Roberts. And even that discussion is marginally interesting. Still, this is a set worth owning.

I enjoy the fact that you can change the board with every game so it makes it different each time you play. Looking forward to purchasing an expansion pack to have even more fun.  The only thing  about our game is the outer edges warped but we are thinking of modifying it to fix that problem.
B000MVZYJO|4.0|I remember reading all of the horrible reviews of The Phantom Menace and my disappointment upon first seeing the film. Admittedly, it's not the greatest Star Wars film and a lot of the criticisms are valid. However, I recently rewatched it with my wife and started to see some value in it. It is an adventure movie with some pretty cool scenes (the Darth Maul duel in particular). But more importantly, it isn't supposed to focus on character and plot development - that's for Episodes II and III. Rather, TPM is just an adventure story to introduce the world of Star Wars (think the Hobbit before the Lord of the Rings). It isn't a great movie, but it's also not so horrible as to cast it out of the Star Wars saga. Overall, a 3.75 star movie.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Great effects!  Wonderful display of visual imagination!  BUT . . .    I have to add my voice to the chorus of those singing \\"I've seen this movie before!\\"    The plot was simplistic, obvious and a mash-up of several other movies on the exact same subject.  I found myself saying \\"Yes, I already know that we humans get carried away in our greed and are capable of destroying a race of people to satisfy it.  Tell me something that I don't know.\\"      I would have liked to see a more traditional Sci-Fi exploration of the Na'vi culture.  That's what I was interested in, not the thinly veiled message.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|There was certainly a lot of buzz surrounding \\"Paranormal Activity\\" when it finally made it to theaters back in October but it's one of those movies that seems to polarize people. Either you think it was a genius masterpiece or shoddily made piece of crap. Care to wager which end I'm on? Yeah, I know it's not much of a gamble is it?    Spoilers ahead!    The plot is fairly straightforward. A couple (Kate Featherston and Micah Sloat who play themselves) live together begin to experience paranormal activity which starts to escalate after the boyfriend purchases a professional video camera and decides to document what's going on. After some prodding and a visit from a psychic, the girlfriend admits that this is not something new to her and she has experienced this since she was a child. The psychic quickly tells the couple that they have a demon and that he isn't equipped to help them and instead gives them the business card of one of his colleagues.    Enter the standard horror movie plot. Micah is \\"that guy\\", (you know, don't be *that* guy) and rather than help his lover overcome the situation he suggests that she not call the demonologist and instead that they just keep filming in hopes of catching something really cool on tape. Things are getting worse gradually, strange noises, objects moving, doors slamming most of it is off camera and can be seen coming a mile away by the audience. That is until Micah barrows a Ouija board after promising Kate that he wouldn't buy one and it bursts into flames while unattended. Everything for them is down hill after this point.    I saw a lot of parallels between \\"Paranormal Activity\\" and the previously reviewed \\"Death of a Ghost Hunter\\". Most of which weren't a positive. 'Ghost Hunter got a 4 out of 10 from me and the only reason it managed to even scrape together that much of a rating was because for all of the things it did wrong (and I mean really wrong) it was at least creative and a little different from the pack. Paranormal Activity on the other hand did the same things wrong and lacked any originality or creativity that saved 'Ghost Hunter from a complete skewering. People pretending to be themselves and running around with a Sony Handicam... yeah we saw that already and it was called \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".    Perhaps the worst part about \\"Paranormal Activity\\" is that it is a lot of build up for nothing. The scary and tense scenes maybe equal an entire twelve minutes of the 86 minute feature. There's a lot of sitting around,  a lot of the couple fighting, and most notably a lot of Micah acting like a disobedient four year old. There are a few genuinely creepy scenes, my favorite of which involved the couple putting down lines of talcum powder from which powdery monster foot prints began to appear during the middle of the night, but that is the closet you'll come to actually seeing the entity. It's a lot of door banging and Katie acting crazy and rocking back and forth.    The verdict? It's been done to death and they don't even try to do it well. A flimsy plot and an entire box of un-creativity sprinkled liberally throughout earned \\"Paranormal Activity\\" a two and half out of ten from me. If you'd like to save yourself the hassle check out this disturbingly accurate account of the movie posted below and save yourself about 76 minutes which you'll never be able to get back.
B001EN71DQ|3.0|Most of the other reviews have complained about the modifications to the film, so I'll talk about something else: the layout of the menu options. The way it's organized is really cumbersome. The bonus features are organized by movie, then by planet, then by type of feature. Given that the only reason many people bought this set was to see the deleted scenes, it just means having to go through many layers to get to the deleted scenes, then you have to backtrack to see the deleted scenes for EACH planet. I can't imagine who thought organizing the features by planet was a good idea. To make things worse, there's no \\"play all\\" option for the deleted scenes. Again, a simple, standard option that makes life easier.  Most of the new deleted scenes themselves aren't particularly exciting and it's clear why they were cut. Amongst the prequels, the only one I enjoyed was the ROTS Elevator Antics because it really shows the bond between Obi-Wan and Anakin. I also liked the Anakin-Palpatine relationship in Amending the Constitution. They're mostly animatics anyways, which aren't that editing to watch.  I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD. The main selling feature of this blu-ray was the bonus features and I just think they could have - and should have - had an easier layout. Hopefully future releases will streamline the menu options. I hate to give Star Wars just 3 stars, but I really think this release could have and should have been better.

B002RSDW80|2.0|Movie - I loved it, except for the political slams, as commented on below.  Turning 30, wondering what you're doing with your life, work stress, juggling marriage, toxic friends, finding something you love to do and are passionate about, mostly likeable characters, flipping from Julia Child's life to Julie's life, I loved it all. It's also one of very few movies or TV that have lightly touched on what should or shouldn't be blogged about, which I think is long over due (on a more serious note). Just very light-hearted, endearing, and enjoyable with enough substance and story and character to make it actually matter in content. Excellent acting, enormous talent, well done.    Political slams in ENTERTAINMENT - TV, in movies,comedy, books, music etc.  I AM FED UP, I DESPISE IT.  Over the years, entertainment has become less entertaining, completely unreliable (constant cencellations after 3 episodes), endlessly repetitive (gotta fit in the mold, don't get too creative), un-imaginative (all stories must be ripped from the headlines, rather than actually written on your own), and recently totally political - sometimes directly offensive, sometimes little slams here and there.      To all of you in the business, from the very bottom to the very top, PLEASE STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!  For this movie,the problem is the latter (political slams) - I finally watch a really relaxing, witty movie, actually unique and entertaining, and they just couldn't help themselves, just couldn't make an entire movie without slipping in political slams.  I ignored all the political historical slams because for all I know, it was all actually true, and some truths about conversations have to be included and some excluded, who knows how it was chosen, and if any or all or none of it was true, it seemed like a part of the story the could legitimately belong (they hated McCarthy, Julia's father wanted the girls to marry republicans, he was a jerk at the wedding because he was a republican, her husband was investigated while working at the embassy because he was a liberal etc., it seemed to be part of the story, so it was fine). But then, In Julie's life, they had to have a current political slant even though there was nothing in the least that led you to believe any of the characters even cared about politics much less had any specific political persuasion, nothing in this present day portion of the movie had anything political about it whatsoever, nor should it have, the story was the story - for once. BUT not to those in SHOW BIZ, where everything requires some kind of political slant-someone who hates liberals or someone who hates conservatives-there's gotta be something in there to make it clear that every story needs this aspect, even if it has no business in the story.    She misses work and her boss actually says \\"anyone else would fire you, a republican would fire you, but I'm not a schmuck\\" How does he know she's not a republican, or her husband's not a republican, or a conservative independent, a conservative democrat who likes people no matter what party they are affiliated with?  The typical assumption is apparently that all Republicans are schmucks and only republicans and certainly all republicans fire people for missing one day of work when you had the \\"flu\\" but were also cooking dinner for a writer from the NY Times and blogged about it all, making it sound like you called in sick but really weren't, even though you actually were sick, but not too sick to cook for the Times.    First of all, good workers, hard working, reliable employees don't usually get fired for missing one day of work, even if it was somewhat questionable.  Secondly, I don't know if democrats or republicans fire more people, hire more people, give more or less benefits to their workers, are more or less understanding about personal lives of their employees etc.  I have no idea, and neither does ANYONE else.  I don't want my entertainment slamming democrats, republicans, independents, green party, non-party, conservatives, liberals, anyone for their political preference or social preference or religious preference etc.  If the movie is about Washington, or politics, or international relations, or anything directly related to politics or a sensitive political issue etc., have all the haters you want if that's what the story is about, but keep your political opinions out of my regular non-political movies and TV and dvd extras and books and concerts.  If it doesn't contribute to the characters, the story, the plot, STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This prejudice DOES and WILL carry over to the real world and workplace at times where you have to be afraid to tell anyone anything you believe in for fear that they will stick you in a \\"box\\", tag it \\"R\\" or \\"D\\" and hate you for it before ever getting to know you. Luckily, most people are good people who judge you on who you are not the \\"R\\" or \\"D\\".  But there are still some who just hate you because they are being told and taught to hate you because you have a different political persuasion.    Lately I am bombarded with hatred or nastiness or flat out prejudice in so many of my former favorite tv shows, constantly in movies, slipped into novels that have nothing whatsoever to do with politics, dvd extras in pamphlets in the package as well as commentary, non-stop in \\"comedy\\"-as if democrats and republicans are the only two groups of people we want you to make nasty jokes about, nasty pronouncements at concerts, it is endless and I am so tired of it. Life is so hard already, why can't I get some entertainment without hate?    DOES ANYONE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY UNDERSTAND THAT HALF THE COUNTRY IS CONSERVATIVE? I'M NOT TALKING POLITICAL PARTIES WHICH CHANGE IN MAKE-UP EVERY FEW YEARS - I'M TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL PEOPLE AND WHAT ACTUAL PEOPLE ACTUALLY THINK, BELIEVE AND FEEL. REGULAR DECENT AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T HATE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR POLITICAL PARTY (WHICH FOR MANY WAS CHOSEN WHEN THEY TURNED 18 AND NEVER CHANGED). Regular, normal, good people, get to know people, and how they act and what they think and decide if they like them or not.  Regular people, have friends who agree with them politically and friends who completely disagree with them politically and love them and respect them all anyway. My family and friends are a haphazard mix of every party and the one thing we all agree on is the nastiness in the entertainment industry and the prejudice all over tv has got to stop.  It is not ok to throw people into two boxes and decide you hate them, that they don't deserve even the slightest bit of decency and respect just because you have labelled them with a D or an R.  In the real world, D's understand and agree with R's on many topics and R's agree with and understand D's on many issues. As for bosses, I've had two favorites in my lifetime of work - one was super conservative, the other super liberal and I respected and adored them both - they respected me, I still, all these years later, refer to them and their management styles regularly, remember what I learned from them and use it. Their politics didn't figure into that in anyway.    So how about you step out of your nasty prejudicial world for five minutes and make some good movies and good tv, and make us laugh, write good books, and entertain us with music without hating on our friends or family or even (g---forbid, ourselves, should we decide to be, hush, hush actual conservatives or liberals, depending on who you hate at the moment).    Blue Ray only features-I have no interest in Blu-Ray, not now, not ever.As for the previous reviewer who wrote about all the features you do not get as a DVD only customer, yet another knife in the back from the industry.  A few years ago, I read about and watched all over the news about how Blu-Ray \\"won\\" the competition with DVD and DVD was \\"over\\".  I was floored, Blue Ray had been out for 5 minutes, the companies met, fought, and decided, without any customer data, without caring what would happen with the future purchases or what the actual public wanted, that Blu Ray \\"won\\".  Another example of an industry who doesn't care what the customer wants, they will do whatever they want and force it down our throats or destroy the format we love so you are so limited that you are forced to get blu ray.  I will be the last blue-ray buyer on the planet if I have to-I tried one and prefer dvd-but now it's more because you are trying to force me to get something I don't want.   I am an electronics junky when it comes to video but I was so angry that they decided the format winner after 5 minutes (ok, maybe a little more) and no customer information that I refuse to play along and give them my money just because they demand that I decide Blu Ray is better. I'll decide, with the rest of the country/world, what I want to watch my tv/movies on, even if I have to buy it used!     Since I'm ranting and giving advice, how about all the industries who want us to have no choice but to buy their product, that we may not want, actually give us choices - the freedom to choose what we like best and then manufacture it so it is a quality item that lasts, so we trust your company and want to buy more products from you, and whatever is popular - by purchase and use, not by force and elimination of choice, is the product that should continue to be manufactured on a larger scale?  Try it, you might like having customers that buy from you because they want your products, like them, and trust that you make quality items.  Rather than the current status quo of shoving something new down our throats,when we all just finally got the previous version, making it cheaply so it doesn't last(while charging a fortune) and we have to keep coming back to fight about warranties and parts, and customers are constantly changing brands because nobody can be trusted, and your taking away or destroying that which we enjoy so that what you want us to enjoy is ouronly choice - even though it is more expensive, not-compatible with many previous items, poor quality, and not noticably any better than what we had before and by the time we finally accept it - there you go again, forcing something else down our throats.  Just give us the choices, and we'll decide which one is better.  Make new products, and we'll decide if we want them - not because you stopped making everything else or gave less and less options for what we actually already own and prefer, but because we want it or it is better.    THE REVIEW/RANT IS NOW OVER. I know, it;s just a movie, but sometimes, it's not just a movie, it's an example of so many things wrong with this industry.

I personally think the Anchorhead scene should have stayed in the movie because it's great characterization for Luke. It's even great seeing rough cuts of the Cantina. The ESB scenes weren't quite as dramatic, although I did like seeing the extra footage of the pre-1997 Wampas. But it's clear those scenes would have detracted from the film. ROTJ also has some neat scenes, such as the one of Luke building the lightsaber - another one that could easily have made it to the final cut. The expanded scenes with Moff Jerjerrod really build up his character and make him a much more sympathetic. I really do wish they'd kept that in.   I want to be clear: these movies look gorgeous on blu-ray. However, they didn't look bad on DVD.

It's a great movie, but it came out in an era when people didn't have home video players (much less DVDs). Lucas cleaned up the movies, made the ships more realistic, and generally most of the improvements make the film look better. I agree that I wish Lucas didn't mess with the Greedo scene - I still believe Han shot first. However, that's relatively minor. Don't let that ruin the movie for you. I think overall you'll find yourself enjoying Star Wars all the more with this DVD version.
0066620996|3.0|Our class was required to read this book within the Founder Institute, an entrepreneurial program.   While interesting I really don't see how people rave about this book.  Good to Great does have more insights for a larger company but for the startup most of this isn't that practical.  The deepest criticism I have is that there are five or six key points made and the knowledge could have been communicated in a few bullet points.  Not a bad read but there are many other business books I would read before this one (Four Steps to the Epiphany being a great one).
B000BKJ78K|2.0|Why would anybody watch these movies on full screen rather than widescreen? There's a lot more image in the widescreen versions. If you don't have a widescreen TV, watch the widescreen version on your computer. Don't sacrifice your viewing experience. Also, the bonus disc is worth getting, which this set doesn't have.

B001YV502C|1.0|I can say it in one line: without children, 100 or 200 years later, nothing is going to matter.  History, Art, Economics, Politics, Medicine, Geography, because no human exist, and everything is irrelevant.  (So that's why when I see law being used to screw people instead of help people, I feel it is used in a reversed way).    Anyway, it can be said in one sentence, I don't know what this movie is trying to say -- and to use \\"Tomorrow\\" as the name of the ship as a symbol?  How shallow is that?    Many scenes in this movie is very \\"acting\\" like.  Even at the beginning, I can feel the actors try to \\"focus and look at the TV and look concerned\\", as being told.  They were not really concerned.  They only tried to look concerned.    Another scene is, the guy and the woman was talking to the soldier in the building (near the end of the movie).  The soldier almost got shot -- the bullets from the street down below would hit places which were 1 or 2 feet away from his face.  So when the bullet hit, he shot back.  And then, he was not even dodging or hiding and then talked to the guy for another 30 seconds.  That is totally fake.

B0000399WC|5.0|Hi,    this is probably my all time favourite movie. Steve McQueen is probably one of my strongest inspirations in life    and probably my favourite role model.    I strongly feel he should have got all the best actor awards for this performance. The movie should have won   all the best movie awards as well along with Franklin Schafner winning every award too.     The movie is an inspiring tale of grit and survival, which McQueen lives and acts up to. The original credit   should ofcourse go to Henry Charriere.     Long live the legendary king of cool. I am from India by the way, not many people know Steve Mcqueen around here.   Lakshman M P
B001EN71DG|5.0|If you didn't like all of the changes to the original trilogy in the 1997 \\"special editions,\\" you'll be happy to know that some of them have been toned down for the release onto DVD. Unfortunately, Greedo shoots first and that stupid rock band is still in Jabba's palace. However, the shootout scene is reworked to make it a bit more plausible (well, a bit) and some of the other changes were simply removed (such as Luke's scream when he falls at the end of Empire). The Jabba the Hutt encounter in A New Hope has also been redone to make Jabba look more realistic. The special effects have all been cleaned up and look incredible. It's still so hard to believe they were made 30 years ago. If you can just ignore the Greedo scene and fast-forward over Jabba's rock band, I think this is the best version of Star Wars yet.<br /><br />Incidentally, there's a lot of complaining on this review board that the original theatrical versions are not in analog or cleaned up. Well, that's tough. As much as I loved seeing Star Wars for the first time decades ago, I like it all the better with Tie Fighters that don't have weird grey patches around them. It's nice to have the original versions for historical and nostalgic purposes, but they aren't the definitive versions of the films. Let's be honest, would anybody have cared 30 years ago whether Han shot first?<br /><br />A more substantive complaint with this DVD set is that it doesn't include any deleted scenes. I'm not sure why there aren't any deleted scenes included in the Bonus Features, because they are rumored to exist. I would love to see the scenes with Biggs on Tatooine, or wampas attacking stormtroopers. I sure hope Lucas releases them at some point - it would be a tragedy if they simply went to waste.
B000056H24|5.0|This is a classic telling of the Gospel of Jesus.  It is somewhat dated compared to modern versions such as \\"Passion\\".  There are many well done dramatic moments recorded using facial expressions in the absence of CGI.  My favorites are the resurection of Lazarus and John Wayne as the Centurian at Jesus's crucifixion.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I've never been quite sure why so many people are complaining about the revisions to the original version of A New Hope. It's a great movie, but it came out in an era when people didn't have home video players (much less DVDs). Lucas cleaned up the movies, made the ships more realistic, and generally most of the improvements make the film look better. I agree that I wish Lucas didn't mess with the Greedo scene - I still believe Han shot first. However, that's relatively minor. Don't let that ruin the movie for you. I think overall you'll find yourself enjoying Star Wars all the more with this DVD version.
B000001E18|5.0|When they released it, a surprise release that came out from just being quickly hacked out during the Zoo Station tour, fans were very confused by it, and Bono himself described it as \\"U2 on the Moon\\". It's certainly not too many people's favorite U2 album -- among other things, it's just too weird for a lot of people, with the title track's prog rock feel rubbing up against the Kraut-rockish \\"Lemon\\" (my personal favorite after all these years), the industrial nihilism of \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\", the mopey power-emo of \\"Stay\\", and the postapocalyptic \\"The Wanderer\\" featuring Johnny Cash (in a foreshadowing of his Viking-funerally-awesome career-capping work with Rick Rubin), creating a rather odd collage of highly experimental music. Even the band itself didn't know what to make of it, at the end -- a lot of Zooropa material never made it into their live sets.    But I liked the album from the very first listen, and compared with a lot of what I liked in the early 90s I think it's aged very well. As a musical collage or an accidental concept album, it all just works, and rather nicely at that. It was a band proving, as they did a decade later with [[ASIN:B0006399FS How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]], that they were capable of stepping outside their comfort zone and still make enviably good music. If you've never heard it and you mostly know U2 from their really famous stuff -- [[ASIN:B000001DTM Achtung Baby]], [[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]], [[ASIN:B00004Z0LW All That You Can't Leave Behind]] -- this will be very unfamiliar territory, but give it a chance. Even if you don't like it at first, at least some of it will grow on you.
B002MAQSC0|5.0|C. S. Lewis wrote this volume first, in 1950, but he later said that The Magician's Nephew, written in 1955, should be considered the first book in his seven book Narnia series. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe occurs when the main character of The Magician's Nephew is an old man, a very wise professor, who lives in a very large house.<br />Four children, siblings, two brothers and two sisters, are sent out of London to the professor's house in the countryside to escape the bombs dropped by the German air force during World War II. They discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a portal leading to the magical land of Narnia.<br />Narnia is under the control of a wicked witch who is a descendant of Adam and the demon Lilith. She has covered all of Narnia with cold weather and snow, with no Christmas for a hundred years. Aslan the lion, the God figure, the creator of Narnia, has been absent from Narnia ever since the wicked witch took control. The citizens of Narnia look forward to his return to save them from the evil. This reminds readers of the popular idea that a messiah will come and help create an ideal world.<br />There is a prophecy in Narnia that if four humans come to Narnia, two males and two females, Aslan will return. The four siblings are present; however, one of the two boys has been seduced by the witch. Nevertheless, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, Father Christmas appears. He gives everyone gifts. He gives the three children instruments of war.<br />How they fought?  What did the lion do? What happened to the witch? What happened to the fourth child? Did all four children return home? These are questions that the rest of the book answers.

B002XTBEDI|2.0|Having loved CRANFORD, the original BBC series shown on Masterpiece Theatre, I placed my advance order for Return to Cranford with great expectations.  Unable to wait for the DVD to rlease I watch the two part series when it aired on Masterpiece Theatre, and found myself enjoying the first of its two parts and looking forward to the second and final installment, only to discover that it lacked everything that made the Cranford expirience what it was.<br /><br />Return to Cranford picks up a year after \\"Cranford\\" ends.  While the four women at the center of Cranford life remain, many of the other charecters have also gone including the village doctors, without any explaination.  Given how important it was for the village to have a doctor in the first series, and then to have the doctors absent without any explainations seemed odd. The cast is smaller and many of the charecters that drove the first series are gone, one would think that the actors have gone onto others things.  However in this series the town seems less full of English life, which is what made the original Cranford so glorious.<br /><br />The first of the two episodes is the better of the two.  One story line involves Lady Ludlow and her faith in her son who has failed her at every turn.  This thread seems to come off the best.  Another story line inolving actor Jonathan Price and his family - and a budding romance is keeps your interest, but it is a pale comparision to the romance in the previous episode as neither actors involved have any spark. This episode's finale has the women of Cranford doing what they do best, and perhaps they should have ended everything right here and left best alone.<br /><br />However in the second episode, while the town and the relationships of the people of Cranford are put to the test, the production falls completly apart.  Too many story lines are processed too quickly - including the introduction of a new charecter and a surprise wedding go full circle -  while the story of Harry and Lord Septimus is left unresoved as is the story line of Mary Smith who appears and then disappears.  In one scene, Dame Judy Dench goes to the Railway Camp in search of another charecter and she just seems very lost - and this becomes an untentional metaphore for the viewer, who is also lost in this scramble to tie up loose ends.  But it the quick cut to, and the chop, chop, chop pacing throws the whole production off kilter. And then, probably because they killed off people in one railway explosion in the first series, the producers thought a second railway explosion would be a nice way to get rid of a few problems.  But the explosion, and accident, and its aftermath is sloppily done.  The final event with no reason, is the return of Jem and Tillie - why?  Not that I'm complaining, but it just happens.<br /><br />This two part event just made me feel as if the producers had the best of intentions, but ran out of time and money.  And that is sad.  Cranford deserves better than the lot it was dealt.Septimus is left unresoved as is the story line of Mary Smith who appears and then disappears.

B0010KX8F8|5.0|I have always enjoyed the movie Contact with Jodie Foster; I has a copy.

B002T9H2ME|5.0|Judging from the advertisements, Moon seemed to be about a man going slowly insane on, well, the moon. I assumed it was more of a movie like Event Horizon, where a lonely person stumbles on some mind-blasting truth. Fortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />Actually, that's an accurate description of the film - it's jut that the mind-blasting truth is eminently relatable and human. Moon's a lot more complicated than it looks.<br /><br />Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the sole inhabitant of a moon base dedicated to mining Helium-3 for Lunar Industries.  His companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), a ceiling-hung robot that expresses itself through emoticons. For three years, Sam has overseen the various mining robots, worked on his wooden models, talked to his plants, and longed to be reunited with his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and daughter Eve (Rosie Shaw). With his time up, he's ready to go home. The catch is that Sam perceives everything through a filtered lens - even his transmissions to Earth are delayed.  Sam isn't just alone for three months; he's alone without any synchronous human contact.<br /><br />Red herrings abound. It's easy to focus on the HAL-like robot GERTY, a major character and foil for Sam. How can you trust something that sounds so benign as Kevin Spacey? Ironically, GERTY is one of the most human characters on the base.<br /><br />Moon's twist isn't in the revelation of The Truth, but in its implications.  Moon questions who Sam is, what he represents, and what makes him - and us - human.  We are, the director seems to say, defined by our memories, and that's enough to fuel us in our daily grind.  Sam is every worker who has been at it for years, always waiting for the next big break, the next reorganization, the next lotto ticket that will get him out of the crappy dead end job. It's a lot like Memento, high praise for a film that cost just $5 million to produce.<br /><br />The fun is in watching Sam deal with the truth of his situation and how he rises above it (or succumbs to it). Moon is littered with clues, making it worth another view. This is a tightly crafted, smart film that takes a single science fiction element and explores it thoroughly.oon is littered with clues, making it worth another view.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|I can tell by reading the reviews on this site that this movie is a love it or hate it thing; Some people found all the dialog and set-up boring, the subtitles a pain in the butt to read, and there was not enough action in this 2 1/2 hour epic film.<br /><br />I, however, thought otherwise. In fact, I would even say that this is Tarantino's best and most mature film despite the premise of 'killing Nazis'. I think many people thought that this was going to be the main premise of the movie, just slaughtering German's left and right. In fact, I do think that the ad campaign for this movie was a little misleading in that respect.<br /><br />This film is all about the dialog, the settings, and waiting for the outcome you know is coming. A great ensemble cast and the use of subtitles only add to the realism, and there is no shortage of either the trademark Quentin humor or sudden bursts of unexpected violence.<br /><br />For those expecting another Kill Bill, they will be sorely disappointed. But for those who are looking for smart, intense, well-acted WW2 drama w/a few unexpected surprises, this is the film for you. It is one of remarkable depth, and it is almost hard to believe Tarantino made it....in a good way.  A thick, rewarding film. Beautifully filmed, too.  The images on blu-ray really come to life; the theater just did not do this movie justice in terms of the visuals.<br /><br />I have watched this 6 times already, and I am sure I will watching it again soon. But that's me.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|To begin with this movie features bits and pieces of Cameron's other movies. Lets start with Aliens, well in Avatar they are trying to farm for natural resources , not much different in Aliens. Also featured from Aliens is the radar scanners and Sigourney Weaver. Next Cameron movie Terminator, Avatar features ships robots just like in Terminator. Finally, Titanic is also featured in Avatar though not a big part, a ship does go down. Having seen the movie all the way through 5 times and just the ending 15 plus times, I still think this movie is not all that it's cracked up to be. You may ask why have I seen the movie 5 times, well I work at a movie theater that requires us to collect glasses at the end of the movie, but have to sit in theater and watch the movie with the paying customers. That being said other 3-D movies such as Up I watched over fifteen times and never got tired of it.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed this sequel better compared to The Hunger Games.  And yes, some may think differently as the first book focuses on the games more, but I felt Catching Fire took us through an aspect of Panem that we needed to know about.  I thought the whole situation with visiting the districts and the start of uprisings was brilliant.  Plus, I loved the different symbolisms that were interpreted through Katniss as she sorta became a symbol of the rebellion.  And let me just say the ending left me \\"hungry\\" for the third and final installment.  This is a must-read for those who like stories with non-stop thrills and suprises at every corner.  I cannot wait until August of this year when the third and final book is released.<br /><br />Go Team Peeta!
B0000258CK|4.0|This review is about the music quality of the 1999 remastered CD with 2 added tracks and not the music itself.  It goes without saying that this is some of the finest pop/folk/rock music ever written and I agree with many other reviews that every song on this 1971 release is great.  The lyrics especially are warm yet cut right to the heart of the matter.    I am not a vinyl \\"purist\\" and in fact prefer CDs over vinyl in most cases.  Howver, this album is an exception.  I still have a mint condition vinyl version of this recording (purchased in 1971) and in comparing to this \\"remastered\\" CD I think the vinyl actually sounds a bit better.  Case in point is the best song on the album, \\"It's Too Late.\\"  Listening on headphones on vinyl the bass, drums and Carole's voice are mixed almost equally and are in the center of the recording.  Some of the guitar solo is on the far left channel and what sounds like an electric piano is on the far right.  There seems to be so much energy in the bass guitar and drums but it does not drown out Carole's voice at all.  The recording sounds like you are there in the studio.    In the CD version, the mix left to right is exactly the same as on vinyl, but the snare drum seems slightly muted compared to the bass guitar and Carole's voice.  Meanwhile the bass guitar, while clearly audible, just doesn't seem to have as much life as on the vinyl version.  Any attempt to increase the bass response just drowns out the drums even further.  Also, it seems that on the loudest parts of Carole's singing, her voice clips out a little and has that sandpapery distorted sound that one usually hears when high notes are played on a worn out vinyl record.  This album originally did not have much in the way of super high end sounds like shimmering acoustic guitar strumming (like David Crosby's If Only I Could Remember My Name) or cymbals, so it is difficult to say if the high end is muted on the CD compared to vinyl.  Both CD and vinyl have somewhat muted cymbals.     These differences are very subtle but clearly the CD did not blow me away as being superior audio to the vinyl copy.  In fact it seems to be slightly worse.  Perhaps it is because this is a very acoustic album with a female voice, but one can really hear the difference at the high points in a song, such as in the chorus.  The CD version has that shrill sound that CDs are so infamous for.  This may be a case of age of the master tapes, I don't know.    In summary, the CD is OK and the music is certainly fantastic, but anyone owes it to themselves to find a good vinyl version and have a listen.  You will be amazed at the depth and quality of the drums and bass compared to the CD version.  And Carole's voice to me sounds less distorted on vinyl.
3899552512|5.0|When I first saw the cover, I immediately placed it on order before it was released. I incorrectly assumed that it would be a how-to book on paper art & crafts. After I got the book, I quickly skimmed through the book, and much to my great delight, it was not a how-to book, but a well-curated \\"exhibition\\" on the art and craft of paper as executed by the designers and artists.  I later discovered that the cover photo is a paper illustration of all the ingredients for its creator's chili recipe.<br /><br />As I went past the title page, I expected to find a table of contents, but it was not included - instead, a preface appeared. As I was reading it, I was relieved to find that it was not an \\"academic treatise\\", but an entertaining, insightful, and beautifully written introduction (authored by Robert Klanten) to paper as a physical and tangible medium for use in fine arts, fashion, illustration, animation, objects and graphic design.<br /><br />Due to the lack of the table of contents, I had to skim through the whole book to count the number of chapters. I have found that it was grouped into five \\"chapters\\" which looked more like categories. Each \\"chapter\\" starts with the text written by Sonja Commentz, and her writings were just as creative as many of the paper works shown in the book.<br /><br />The book itself is truly mind-boggling especially when all of the works are either done in two-dimensional or three-dimensional with nothing but paper.  One could say that it's sheer paper madness - murals, display, poster, collage, typography, objects, characters, toys, shoes, costume, trains, villages, repurposed/altered books, life-sized dioramas, installation sites and many more.<br /><br />From examining the colorful and good sized photographs, I saw that many different paper craft techniques were employed in various projects: folding, kirigami, cutouts, silhouettes, sculpting, scoring, and embossing, to name a few.  The coffee table size of the book allows many of the photographs to be large enough for me to be able to look at some of the works in detail so that the paper techniques can be figured out.<br /><br />At the end of the book is an index where the first letters of the company names and even the artists'/designers' names are sorted. The strange thing is that there is a table of contents included - not for the book itself but for the CD which is attached to the inside back cover. The included CD contains both the videos (DVD) and the templates (ROM) for 18 \\"urban paper\\" artists' models. The video portion contains interviews, animation and demonstration. One of my favorite paper animation videos, This is Where We Live, done by Apt & Asylum Films is included and I was absolutely delighted to have it in my possession.<br /><br />In summary, this book is the most inspiring book on paper creativity I have ever come across. I wish that it would be given a better title to do it much greater justice. Anyway, I love and am grateful for the fact that I have many of the great paper work in one bound physical copy instead of an electronic list of various paper artists'/designers' websites. I highly recommended this book for anyone who loves the look and feel of paper anywhere and everywhere.ugh for me to be able to look at some of the works in detail so that the paper techniques can be figured out.

B000ENWKN8|4.0|This is what should have followed Astro-Creep, be it solo or a WZ album. Here he picks back up moderately lyrically and musically where that left off. Lyrically a demented heavy Tom Waits / Beat Poet from Hell (Kerouac filtered through EC Comix, Ginsberg taking it from a cartoon Satan..) None of that cashing in on the Munsters garbage, all that was funny and cool to an extent, but none of it has lasting power..His power was in blending grim reality and cartoon/B-Movie imagery...An apex met visually w/ The Devil's Rejects, musically with this...maybe...with what would be next?

B0031S4K5E|1.0|Ponyo is not a great and perfect film by any means. I love Miyazaki's works but this one is not quite on target. But I still will buy it because it does have charming Miyazaki touches, and the characters are drawn from faces we love from Totoro and all of Miyazaki's films. What I find especially objectionable is Disney's marketing ploy: the Ponyo plush looks cute, but why is it only available with the DVD, and not the blu-ray? I contacted Disney and got the sorry but plush only with the DVD...which tells me nothing new. I am willing to buy into the combo pack where you get both the DVD and Blu-ray together,but how much more sweeter would it be to have that Ponyo plush included?

0316044938|5.0|Lovely Bones has been listed as summer reading material in most high schools and has been described and raved about so greatly because of the writers choice of words. Although many schools appreciate this literture it has only been provided in high schools that being because the main character is raped and murdered. Eventhough the book provides as little detail to illustrate the tragedy it only takes one minute to realise the significance of that chapter.The book also holds strong meanings such as the struggles of those involved in her life.  Many parents and readers argue whether the book can be read by minors of 13 years of age. In my opinion this book does capture the attention of teens  but for kids of 13 to 15 it remains for the parents to evaluate their children.<br />How much have they been exposed to?<br />Will this distraught them or mature them to think otherwise?<br />My understanding of this book was that the lovely bones holds a compelling story of life and love.
0786915749|4.0|My main focus when reading a book is the setting and the dialogue. And that is where it lost a star; the dialogue. Possibly because this is their very first book (the second and the third showed tremendous improvement), some of the conversations are a little clichéd, sometimes borderline cheesy.    What redeems this book and elevates it to the realm of re-read (I think I've read this book more than a dozen times now) are the characterization and the world creation. Writing a good fantasy half depends on creating a believable world with its history; each faction, each sect, each job is created with reason, and the reasons should be evident. This book succeeds in making it clear why such part of the world exists (the knights, the wizards, the seekers, e.t.c.). The characters are vibrant and rich in color, making each character distinct and memorable; it is easy to envision them. Each has a problem that (s)he must face, be it external or internal. Not every character is likable, but each character is a hero (something that is not often done, and even then very rarely well). Even the \\"hated\\" character - the wizard - is likable to a certain level.     This series will get you hooked. It got me hooked. It got others hooked. I found it rather unfortunate that the series had ended for now; I would have loved them to live on within the pages.     Go buy this book. It's worth a second and a third re-read.
B0010DRYSM|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made.  And given our current political circumstance (early 2010) may be be as relevant today as it was when Hitler came to power.<br /><br />The DVD quality (this if for the Special Edition DVD) is absolutely terrible.  It works okay on a 4:3 television; but this DVD is not an anamorphic transfer and is terrible to watch on a widescreen TV.<br /><br />Given the greatness of the movie itself - it won 8 Academy Awards - I am stunned that Warner Bros. cannot see fit to re-release this with a quality anamorphic transfer.<br /><br />- - -  Updated February 7, 2013  - - -<br /><br />I received the blu-ray yesterday.  It is a vastly different (and much better!) movie than the terrible transfer of the special edition version.  The rendering in blu- ray is well done; with many scenes giving a 'period' look and other scenes rendered razor-sharp.  The sound is high quality.  The rendering in blu-ray is exceedingly 'watchable'.<br /><br />Please note that I'm no expert on film quality - I'm sure a knowledgeable person can give more info.<br /><br />Liza's performance is simply masterful!  Joel Grey and Michael York are tremendous in their roles.  And might I say that this movie transformed Hollywood musicals in a way that nothing else has . . .  Kudos to Bob Fosse for magnificent direction and choreography!<br /><br />But for people knowledgeable of history, this movie is much more than a mere musical; for this movie is raw and disturbing in its depiction of the rise of the Nazis in early 1930s Germany.  Here, the jackboots of the Nazi brownshirts are beginning to stomp on the necks of peaceful people; and in this regard, the story is powerful - tremendously so.<br /><br />This is an important story.  I highly recommend it!
B002MFU9BG|5.0|Saw this band on the Late Show on January 18th, 2010 and they were excellent. The song they played \\"How You Like Me Now\\" was amazing and Letterman was so impressed that he asked for an encore, something I've never seen or heard him do before. Check out the album, you won't be disappointed.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|There is no one else in the universe like Leonard Cohen and no CD of his comes so much from the soul as this one. My husband and I, sipping tequila in hand, listened not once but twice as winter settled on our back yard. Cohen delihgted us, he moved us to tears, to the heights of joy and the depths of familiarity with life's realizations. This amazing performance undoubtedly crossed generations, but with no ill will intended to those under 50, the lives brought forth by Cohen in his poetry and song resonate most vividly in those of us who have been there.  Treasure this CD and if you are in the younger age group hold on to it, listen as often as you want to but make a date to contemplate it as art once every ten years.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|Top notch writing, directing and cast. Exciting. Keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time. Hard to keep yourself from watching it all in one sitting even though it's several hours long.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This is phenomenal.  I bought this set for my oldest who is seven.  Not only does it have over 1,600 pieces but the details are just amazing.  We found this set for 100.00 dollars at a local lego store, and it is the best set we have collected to date.  Aside from the hours of fun your child will have putting this together, the village houses can be closed for quick and easy storgae.  Many of our sets end up diassembled, but I am confident this one will stay together for a long time.  I even joked with my son that he shouldn't be surprised if one morning he woke up and found me playing with it.  This was a great buy at 100.00.  I also like that it was not divided into bags.  My son was forced to figure out a system for organizing the 1,600 pieces to assist in the building process.  I have always been a huge fan of legos, but this set blew me away.  Aside from the fact that your child will improve his dexterity, he/she is forced to follow detailed directions and develop his/her spacial orientation skills, and that is only with the assembly.  Afterwards he/she is presented with endless oppurtunities to let his/her imagination go wild.  One thing my son really liked about this set was the number of figurines, and there were quite a few.  Great set.  Enjoy.

B000FC1LOC|5.0|my sisters keeper is so touching and suspenseful. it kept me reading til midnight and sometimes longer. sometimes i put down the book crying and in other parts laughing as hard as i could. reading that book was always a great tiem and the surprising ending, loved it.
0547260695|5.0|Excellent edition of this classic story with the pop up addition delightful!
0780021967|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in awhile.  The suspenseful chase across Great Britian kept me on the edge of my seat, the acting was supurb, there was humor, the main character was someone I could admire, and it had a wonderful clean romance (something most of the movies made today lack).  I'll be watching more of Hitchcock...if his others are as good as this I don't know what I'll do with myself!
630460288X|5.0|What kind of movie is this? An action flick?  A movie warning us about the bland, boring, goodie-goodie future to come?  A comedy?  A horror film?  Demolition Man can be many things.  But boring is not one of them.  Full of humor, explosions, stars who were big or about to become big, this movie is a must see.  And you will see it.  Again and again.  The DVD has production notes, a trailer and even a commentary track, which makes it a great find.  Many early DVDs just do not have the extras.  How can you NOT like a film with Sandra Bullock, Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and rat burgers!  Yummy!
B002UJIY70|4.0|Milla Jovovich is probably best known for the \\"Resident Evil\\" trilogy, \\"Ultra-Violet\\" or \\"The Fifth Element.\\"  She also a rather high profile model.<br /><br />Still, these are rather lacking in showcasing an underrated talent.  I've had the pleasure of seeing Jovovich in some relatively obscure films where she proves she can actually ACT.  She has a particular gift for taking roles that could easily be \\"over-acted,\\" instead showing a masterful moderation, and gives fairly nuanced performances--even in something like a mediocre rom-com.<br /><br />The plot involves sort of a classic \\"who will kill who?\\" thriller set on the gorgeous backdrop of Kaua'i, perhaps Hawaii's best kept secret (gorgeous island, much less touristy than Maui or Honolulu, etc.)<br /><br />Like any good thriller there are plenty of twists and a grand twist, but this film never cheapens them.  When it does finally put all of the cards on the table, it does so in a brilliant 20 min. (give or take) sequence that not only makes it credible, but it adds an emotional depth that is succinct, memorable, and dare I say a bit heart-breaking?<br /><br />The main downside is that some of the red-herrings are a bit obvious, but these flaws are mitigated largely by the aforementioned sequence and its careful foreshadowing.  One final downer: lackluster extras.  (Simply, an alternate ending.)  Still, the Blu-Ray trumps the DVD (for those of you making a choice) because the visuals and scenery are absolutely stunning in gorgeous widescreen HD.
B002XHN776|2.0|I'm really just not feeling the direction these guys are heading. The new album is more political, futuristic and less angry (which is what I liked about 30).  From hearing Leto scream to hearing kids singing in harmony just left me disappointed.
0143038419|2.0|I am half-way through the book and I am finding it: boring. There really is nothing to it. Don't waste your money.
0393316041|5.0|I read this when I was in school. I have bought it for my daughter now!! Its a well written book, intelligent and thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a parent looking for something to present your kids with, this is a wonderful one!!
0670021652|1.0|I LOVED Eat Pray Love. This book is a waste of time. I am not usually so harsh, but I found this to be a self-serving and boring work basically trying to convince herself and the reader she was not to blame for the failure of her first marriage. After all, odds were against her.     It is interesting to contemplate what the rest of the world thinks of marriage, how some cultures don't get caught up in the rose colored version of what a *good* spouse is. However, I think some of her *insights* are things most grown ups who have been married for any length of time eventually figure out. I didn't read anything I didn't already know, in other words. Its more than luck and statistics being on your side that make a good marriage. You have to be willing to work and make compromises. Ms Gilbert seems inclined towards neither.
0312370849|5.0|This book was selected for my book club. I never would have chosen to read it, but I'm glad I did! I loved Sarah's story; I didn't enjoy Julia's story as much but Sarah's half more than made up for it.
1416955070|4.0|I enjoyed City of Bones very much.  It was funny, witty, and just fun altogether.  I loved the characters' personalities more than anything.  The characters were original, but deep down just like every other teenager.  The  problems the characters got themselves into were creative and fun.   The flaw was simply that this book is much like the other books that are currently being published.  Many of these books include vampires or werewolves or even witches.  This book contains all of the above.  While these are fun things to read about, this  book is not very original.  Sure it is exciting, but so are a lot of other books.     In some areas however, the other is very original.  Such as the drawings that the shadow hunters tattoo on their body.   Half of the time I felt as if I was reading Star Wars, the relationship between Clary and Valentine are similar to Luke and his father.    Thus the book being like a lot of other books, I really liked it.
0132350882|5.0|Original review by Mario Fusco, Java User Group Lugano [...]    Programmers spend probably more than 80% of their time reading someone else code instead of writing their own. This is why is important that who writes the code pays particular attention not only to what it does but also to how it does that. For example, for a compiler doesn't make any difference if a variable is called p or pageCounter, but of course it makes a big difference for the programmer who have to figure out what kind of information that variable contains. That explains why it is easier to write code for compilers than for people.    Of course a well chosen name is definitively not enough to make your code readable. This book provides some really good principles that all developers can benefit from using in order to make your code more readable and consequently cheaper to be maintained and easier to be refactored. Among the suggestions made by the book to achieve these results you can find:    * keep each method as short as possible: 15 lines of code is a reasonable limit that should not be overcome;  * give each method a single responsibility: if you are trying to give a meaningful name to the method and it comes out that the name should contain an \\"and\\" there is a big likelihood that you are breaking this rule;  * never declare a method with more than 3 parameters: if you need more it is always a good idea to group them as properties of an object;  * don't use nested cycles or conditions: you can improve both readability and reusability by putting them in little separated methods;  * write comments only when strictly necessary and keep them updated with the code: there is nothing more useless than a comment that explains what you can easily read from the code or more confounding than a comment that says something different from what the code actually does;  * fix a set of shared coding standards: a programmer can understand a piece of code faster if he doesn't meet unexpected surprises whilereading it.    Reading this book you will learn how to implement in your code these and other advices through lots of wonderfully clear and easily reusable examples. The book put an important accent also on how to make your code more robust by building a set of meaningful unit tests and how to leverage that test suite in order to safely improve your code through successive refinements.    In the end this book will teach you how to make your code easily readable by another programmer, making his job more simple. And this is a valuable thing especially considering that there is a high possibility that the next programmer who will read that code could be yourself.
B000FBFMFW|4.0|At times during this book I felt it deserved 3 stars, while at other times I was sure it needed 5.<br /><br />I will not lie to you; this is the most depressing book I have read yet. The ending of this book and the beginning of the next leave you with an absolutely distraught feeling as though all the life force has been sucked out of you - but do not let that distract you! The writing is amazing and the story is good (not as solid as the first book but still a good story). I felt there was a lot of superfluous information in this second series of the farseer saga, but overall I think it was a really good read. I was so sucked into the story I could scarce devote time to much else.<br /><br />A disturbingly heart-shattering book expertly written and cleverly seductive. I say its definitely worth 4 stars!
1416572287|3.0|Chad Orzel has come up with an interesting way to teach quantum physics - by using scenarios from the real world.  He does this specifically by having conversations with his dog, Emmy, about how she'd like to catch those fast bunnies and squirrels in the back yard, or live in a universe where Chad always drops steak on the floor.  It helps to make a difficult-to-understand subject a little more applicable to what we see, and the little discussions he has with the dog are used very well to clear up the ideas he's discussed and I found many of my own questions answered that way.<br /><br />My beef with the book is that it wasn't clear this was about quantum physics.  Mr. Orzel is not really writing for the lay person as much as he's writing for someone who already has a decent understanding about classical physics.  My high school physics class was a long time ago and I didn't understand it very well even then.  But it's still a subject I wish I could understand better now, but it doesn't seem to come as easily as it does for some others.  Nonetheless, I can say that I now understand *some* things about quantum physics a little better.

B000MM0L4Q|5.0|The center still held in 1975, even as pop and rock music continued to explode all over the place. Radio, believe it or not, kids, wielded authority and even adventurous listeners and fans held preconceptions about what recording artists should sound like. David Bowie would never be mistaken for conformist or conventional. \\"Young Americans\\" the single was a zeitgeist moment and a helluva hit for this great and strung-out talent, but it was more of a calling card than the meat of the album. Those songs, \\"Win,\\" \\"Fascination, \\"Can You Hear Me,\\" \\"Right,\\" were not treated kindly by Bowie fans or a lot of the press. I thought about this today when I played a Stanley Turrentine album from the same year called \\"In the Pocket\\" that Downbeat gave one star to and everybody ripped. It, like \\"Young Americans\\" is filled with a cool Philly soul sound with touches of impending disco and both have a commanding presence at the center -- the Bowie croon, the fat Turrentine horn. These artists weren't playing what people wanted or expected from them and paid for it critically. Now, they look like pop visionaries. Bowie had completely shed his filthy spandex theatrical space glam from \\"Diamond Dogs\\" just a year earlier. How he went in such short order from the creeped-out, post-apocalypse, where \\"the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy thoroughfare\\" to fully inhabiting the deliciously taut, coke-fueled bedroom seduction of \\"Right\\" is a pop music miracle.
1577314808|1.0|Its funny that this book is about the dangers of over thinking and over analyzing yet that is exactly what this book does! Reading this book actually gave me anxiety! I recommend getting a dvd on meditation, yoga and practice the art of relaxing, breathing. Happiness comes from building healthy relationships with people, go out and have dinner with a friend, go on a date, volunteer.
1433502410|3.0|Yes, I am having a Problem with this Book. AMAZING NOTES, REFERENCES etc... but what they are doing is taking words out and adding new one.     I have the Hebrew and Greek Manuscripts right here to prove this.    [...]    Now in Isaiah 14 where it is suppose to say \\"O LUCIFER, Son of the Morning Star\\" it says in the ESV, \\"O Day Star, Son of the Dawn\\".. Now either their ignorant of the manuscripts or they purposely did this. The NIV Did the same thing except they called it the, \\"Morning Star\\"..    Another Example is Matthew 24:7...\\"There will be Famine's, and Earthquake's in various places.\\"(ESV)    Greek Manuscript: \\" and there shall be  famines, and pestilences, and  earthquakes, in divers places.\\"    I know alot of you think this is just picking, but DO YOU REMEMBER what Revelations last chapter said? \\"DO NOT ADD OR TAKE AWAY ANY WORD!\\" - This was a clear warning!      Q: Why did they do this? What was the reason? 95 Evangelical Scholars??? Do they think we are dumb?    I Love the Bible they made but DO NOT! I re-peat, DO NOT! Add or Take away.. They clearly added \\"Day Star\\" and Took away \\"Pestilences\\"?? WHY!
B0012GMVVW|5.0|This is the best record Bowie's put out since - what? - Young Americans.     Coincidence? No. Tony Visconti is the magic ingredient.     I was raised on early Bowie - from the absolute start to Heroes. I got off the bus around Let's Dance - not my cup of tea.     Heathen is thoughtful, engaging, fun, and interesting to listen to.
0810983915|4.0|Great book for school kids with related experience.  I got it along with the two following books for my nephew and he is very thrill to get all three books at once.  He and his friends have been reading them and like them a lot.

B002XTBEDI|3.0|Great production, but does anyone know when the Blu-ray version is coming?  The original series has been out for some time in Blu-ray.  Was hoping that \\"Return\\" would be out in Blu-ray by now.  My wife and I recently upgraded to the Blu-ray version of the BBCs 1995 Pride and Prejudice, and what a difference!  Much sharper and more vivid image.  Assuming that the same may hold true here, we'll wait for Blu-ray.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Once upon a time there was a movie (or \\"film\\", since it takes itself very seriously), with a gay director and gay actors.  Gays were repressed and seen as unamerican aliens (especially by the House Committee...). They could understand and show the plight of women and minorities. James Whale had done just that in WATERLOO ROAD and ONE MORE RIVER. The master George Cukor had directed one of his masterpieces with THE MODEL AND THE MARRIAGE BROKER.It was an opportunity to show teenagers as strangers in their own country, treated as enemies, as gays were. Alas, it was all about whining, led by a cry baby, pretty long in his teenager tooth.  The adulterer cries that his wife doesn't understand him. The whining adolescents of the film whined that their parents didn't understand them.  I would call that family adultery by whining.  There was no real sens of alienation, except in a forced theatrical way.  35 years later, John Waters gives us a true masterpiece, which doesn't take itself seriously.  The situation is simple: no guilty parents. The society separates easily the upper and middle classes from the poor people.  The poor teenagers are juvenile delinquents by nature. They are very innocent here.  The action takes place in 1954, the same year that the notorious \\"film\\" was shot (released in 1955.  THE BLACKBOARD JUNGLE was published in 1954, the tame but very good film was released in 1955.THE JUNGLE KIDS, also by Evan Hunter was published as a Pocket books original in July 1956. It is a heart wrenching American masterpiece. A MATTER OF CONVICTION followed in 1959 (another very good film). they deal with teenagers becoming unwilling J.D.  The unexpensive DVD is a thing of joy: very good transfer for a very good cinematography and visual style. Waters wanting to recreate the saturated colors of the mid fifties (you can watch them in Paramount films,the Jerry Lewis movies if you are not prejudiced.  It's all about what makes youth so important: joy of living, dynamism, in a latter Mickey Rooney sort of way, invention.  The songs are exciting, the choreography is stirring. Everything is perfect.  An inspired casting idea is POLLY BERGEN, still looking great, as the rich, straitlaced at first, grandmother.  She didn't act in many movies but will be remembered for KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT 1964 (unreleased in France) where she is elected as President of the US but soon sees her kids adrift, her husband without his firm. \\"Fortunately\\",she becomes pregnant and resigns.  Sexism is not an invention by the East coast lberals.
0899669433|5.0|As the title suggests I have been waiting for this book for a good while and I have finally found it here at Amazon. Since many of the hardcovers are out of print \\"The King in Yellow\\" is hard to come by. However some publishers have carried on printing hardcovers and this one is very nice. It has a library binding which means they added a lot of reinforcing stiching to strengthen it and make it easier to read as well. Needless to say they did a good job! I just love the subtle horror of the stories. I almost wish the terrible fictional book of the same name as this one existed.
B002T921DE|5.0|George Michael was a favorite as I was growing up. Every time he was on tour, I never got to see him. I was either too young or did not have the means.  When I found out he was going on tour and coming to San Diego, California, I was too excited. It was Amazing that I was finally going to see him live. A big treat was that he was kicking off this 25LIVE World Tour here in my hometown San Diego. Tuesday, June 17th 2008 proved to be one of the best nights in my life. One of the best concerts I have attended.  I was there with 2 of my sisters and thoroughly enjoyed this performance.  The songs I really enjoyed are : Fast Love, Flawless [Go to the City], of course, Everything She Wants, Too Funky, Spinning the Wheel, the hopeful song, Amazing and the classic melancholic Careless Whisper. Two more Amazing treats besides opening night in San Diego, were 2 bonus songs. George Michael decided that the U.S. would get the remix version of Amazing, Wow! How awesome is that? The other song was Kissing a Fool. This was so cool for me. This song took me back in time to my Military days and reminded me of my first infatuation. The sound in the Stadium was superb and the Blu-ray does a great job of keeping that sound just as it was inside the thunderous stadium. I bought two copies, one for a sister who attended with me and one for myself. As soon as my other sister who attended with us goes Blu, I will get her a copy. I did much research on price for this Blu-ray and Amazon was by far the best price anywhere. As bonus material, this comes with a Documentary as well as a 4 page insert booklet.It has 3 audio options to choose from, I am sure you will find the one that satisfies you. The quality of the video, the graphics and everything about this concert will blow you away. I highly recommend this milestone concert to any person who was ever inspired or touched by one of George Michael's songs. True fans and new fans will not be disappointed with this concert. You get the highest quality for your money. Fans that could not make it to one of his shows can truly enjoy and feel the ambiance of this show. The energy was Amazing and the memory will linger. Hope this helps other fans to stop thinking about buying this, just click to buy. This is worth every penny. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Namaste!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I left the UK to move to L.A. several years ago, so I may be biased about my like of this movie. I saw it in the theater when it first came out. It's a charming film--with clever writing and lovable characters--that leaves you warm and fuzzy at the end. Eli Wallach celebrated his 90th birthday during the making of this film. He's a jewel, and his relationship with Kate Winslet's character is just marvelous. Loved all four of the main characters to pieces. I watch it every year now at Christmas.
B00275EGX8|5.0|Great movie.  For all those reviews stating what they did wrong in the film, if I wanted to see a documentary on EOD technicians I'd watch something on the military or history channel-it's Hollywoodized and the movie was entertaining.
0764207407|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

B002BSHWUU|4.0|If you're looking at this product right now, face it. You're going to buy it...it's just a question of when, how and for how much.<br /><br />Allow me to suggest you opt for the DIGITAL edition. This allows you to not only dive in immediately, but also avoid the predictable, lame packaging which isn't worth the shipping costs.<br /><br />Naturally, the main thing is the music. And, thankfully, the Beatles' catalogue has been remastered for the ages. Yet it is packaged it in a way that will be lucky to last six months before becoming unglued or torn. Apple really blew an opportunity here.<br /><br />What's worse is, if they wanted to go lo-fi on packaging, couldn't Apple have at least used recycled papers and soy-based inks? IMO, I can't help but think George or John would be too thrilled about such an obvious cost-cutting decision.<br /><br />It's safe to say Apple's marketing genii undoubtedly have a \\"premiere edition\\" of the box set in the works...one with all the graphic goodies that this set could've had. Just wait and see.<br /><br />In the meantime, it goes without saying this thing is 5 stars and absolutely essential. But for now, the only 5-star way to get it happens to be digital.
B002QY9RMA|4.0|My daughter loves HALO and really wanted this album.  I also love halo but really didn't know the other songs.  I have really enjoyed this album and am quite surprised as this normally isn't my kind of music.    Beyonce is very talented and sings a great variety of songs here--from the upbeat rock songs to rap (i guess you would call it that in the song \\"Diva\\") to the more melancholy slower songs.  i thought my daughter would be very disappointed in the slower songs and she has discovered that she loves those as much as \\"if i were a boy\\" or \\"halo\\".  In fact, my daughter, 11 years old, loves Ave Maria.    Often I find that when i get an album there are only a couple songs that I like--but I would have to say that I like all but 2 of these songs.  And even those, i don't hate--i could just do without them.    Highly recommend for the younger generation as well as those of us who are middle agers!!!

B00005NUZM|5.0|Off The Wall being Jacksons 5th studio album and 1979 release and was a major hit amongst the critics and was a massive hit in the UK, Australia and France to mention a few. The sound of \\"Off The Wall\\" is a mix of disco, pop and R&B. Allmusic, Q and Blender all gave it 5/5. The album has many hits including \\"Don't stop till you get enough\\", \\"Rock with you\\", \\"She's out of my life\\" \\"Of the wall\\" and \\"Girlfriend\\". In my opinion this release is just as good as his masterwork Thriller. This special edition also contains demo versions of \\"Don't stop till you get enough\\" \\"Workin' Day and Night\\". It also contains interviews with producer Quincy Jones and Songwriter Rod Temperton discussing the maing of the album \\"Off The Wall\\". 5/5.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I think that everyone must see this film.  It is true that this film will change the way that you look at food!  Parts are disturbing to watch but it is crucial that we recognize where are food is really coming from.      This film also sheds light on how our fast food world has changed the entire food industry.  It is really true that everytime we make a purchase at the grocery store we are essentially placing a vote.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I wanted to see this movie for a couple of reasons: the previews showed Streep as Julia Child and they could have been twin sisters.  Secondly, I have often wondered about Julia and what she has done to the world of American cooking.  Her TV show was really the first \\"reality\\" show on cooking -- we now take the Food Network for granted, but it was a breath of fresh air to enjoy a cooking show with Julia Child back in the Sixties and Seventies.<br /><br />A woman wrote a book about following Julia's recipes and this film is her story -- or rather, half the story.<br /><br />Julie Powell has just moved to a dumpy apartment above a pizza place in Queens.<br /><br />Julie Child has just moved to a nice place in Versailles, France to be with her husband, Paul.<br /><br />Both Julies are paralleled throughout the film.  We get to see their losses and loves and their goals and purposes throughout the movie.<br /><br />What this movie has is heart.  The editing has been done in a fashion where the Julia Child story is endearing.  Child has no real purpose and realizes with her husband, Hey, why not learn how to cook?  And that extrapolates to Hey, let's write a cookbook on French cooking for American wives and mothers.<br /><br />Powell has no real purpose, either.

0786838655|5.0|Percy \\"Perseus\\" Jackson knows he is different. He sees strange things (like letters floating off the page and shadows where they shouldn't be); has a small problem with his math teacher (Mrs. Dobb) who'd like nothing better than to kill him; doesn't really remember his father (but wants to); hates his stepfather, Gabe (who literally stinks); and finds himself constantly switching schools (because of the bizarre occurrences that happen around him). Learning that he is the half-blood of the God of the Sea (Poseidon), and must retrieve the one item (Zeus' Thunderbolt) that can prevent a war and return it to Olympus. Fearing for his life,  and the end of the world as we know it, Percy must travel to Camp Half-Blood to discover the truth of who and what he is.     However Camp Half-Blood is but the first stop in his travels on the way to Olympus. With the help of his two most trusted friends, Grover (a can eating satyr) and Annabeth (a half-blood), Percy not only gets an opportunity to kill a minotaur, behead Medusa, meet his father and returns his uncle's most prized possession, but he also uncovers a plot meant to destroy peace among the Gods. Needless to say, everything is not as it seems. And while worrying about saving the world may sound simple, Percy has to do all this while solving the riddle of what the Oracle meant when she gave three dire predictions, one of which he fears may be concerning his mother.     My 11-year-old son gobbled up this book (and those that follow in the series), and challenged me to read it. He assured me that Percy's adventure rivaled no other, and once I read the first one I would be unable to stop myself from reading them all. Guess what? He was right. Riordan's tale made for several hours of reading enjoyment. There was magic, fight scenes, action, adventure and a wonderful story, which are all necessary to build the foundation of a terrific and mind-blowing series. And finally, my son was right, I have the rest of the series stacked in a pile (next to my bed) waiting to be read, and I can't wait.

I think some readers that have left negative comments do not realize that this book was not \\"written\\" by the author but by actual, living people.  What a great way to teach students as well about WWII and it opens up a whole new interest for me about this era.  I am so impressed with the writing styles of these \\"characters\\".

0393327655|5.0|The best place to begin reading about atheism is with Harris' book. It is a bible for atheists (pardon the pun ... no, don't even pardon it). The mantra for atheists should be Harris' phrase: \\"The irrational embrace of mythology,\\"  describing the world's faiths. Examples of how religion has been debilitating worldwide is best seen in the Muslim religion according to Harris. Poverty, lower status in the world's cultures and the image of terrorists are all due to the practices of Islam. Four thousand people died in the 9/11 attacks and the hijackers were under the illusion that they were doing God's work. After they sacrificed their lives they would be getting 72 virgins in paradise. What BS! Harris focuses on what a conservative religion Islam is with woman dressing from toe-to-head in burkas, only to receive the most hedonistic rewards in the afterlife for the most monstrous of acts. More BS! Don't stop with the Islamic fundamentalists, we've got our own here with George W. A man that was a skirt-chasing, beer-drinking, ne'er-do-well until he found God. Then he turned his life around! The hypocrisy of Bush administration speaks volumes of what religious leaders will do when given the right political tools. In the 2004 reelection bid, most voters stated the reason they voted for him was because they identified with his values. OHHHH MYYYYY! Harris focuses on the social implications with his arguments as oppose to someone like Richard Dawkins, who is more scientific and long-winded with his views. This is a starter book in so many ways. Starter for a freethinker (or whatever you want to call yourself), a starter for the religious believer to understand how the atheist movement is just beginning to get a foot hold in America and for anyone that is really interested in a rational look at faith. A book for all, but one I will use as a starting point.

It shows you the power of God in so many levels, so if you don't believe in God you will not get this movie and if you do; you may have some feelings about how this is presented, but it was a good versus evil with a lot of unexpected twist to it.      It lets you know no matter what; Good will always prevail.  There wasn't anything I would have changed, because the movie had great balance to it. Great job DW!

006621131X|5.0|Before she became the Godmother of Punk, Patti Smith was just some girl who came to New York in search of herself.  We have a tendency to view her as always having been a rebel, guitar in hand, spouting her distinctive mix of poetry and invective at society.  But the reality was that Smith came to New York as a refugee, uncertain of who she was and what she wanted to be.  That's sometimes a bit hard to believe or realize, but in \\"Just Kids\\" Smith reveals just that: she wasn't one half as confident then as she is now, and that she had no idea what she was going to do once she arrived in New York.  While this is true of almost everyone from her generation, it is somehow shocking and bizarre to ponder.  More interesting was that her first lover and partner in New York was none other than future photographer Robert Mapplethorpe.  The bulk of \\"Just Kids\\" is Smith's recollection of Smith's early years in New York with Mapplethorpe and how they came to create their own image as artists and autuers and to craft their image and art.  Again, it seems weird to think of either of them as being anything other than fully formed individuals, and that, in and of itself, seems supremely bizarre.  We seldom think of the intervening events that came to create them as artists, yet here is Patti Smith lying bare exactly how she came to be what she became.  The result is a fascinating and spellbinding narrative that you can scarcely set down.  Ultimately Smith learns that Mapplethorpe is gay and both go on to find their own loves and their own directions in life and in art.  In that degree \\"Just Kids\\" feels like only the beginning of a captivating story, the transition to another chapter, and I sincerely hope, a transition to another volume of memories, as I'm no doubt certain that Smith has a wealth of other memories than span well into the 80s, 90s and beyond.  But for now I'm heartened to hear what she has to say as for now, the era before she became Patti Smith. And rather than being a trip down memory lane, \\"Just Kids\\" reminds us that everyone had to start somewhere, and success is never easy or certain.  Smith's prose also wonderfully captures an era of New York City that has largely faded to the mists of time and memory.  It is a time and place I was glad to revisit for a while.  Immensely enjoyable and quite readable \\"Just Kids\\" is probably one of the best rock autobiographies I've ever read!a trip down memory lane, \\"Just Kids\\" reminds us that everyone had to start somewhere, and success is never easy or certain.

If you're familiar with the \\"S\\" or \\"C\\" curve gesture drawing, he will go into details of it metaphorically.  One metaphor that I loved was the mountain skiing and how it represented rhythms.   Mattesi will discuss perspectives, overlaps, straight vs curves, sculpting forms, animals and more.

B002HNA95E|5.0|Since her arrival on the radio airwaves in the early 80's, Madonna has been the premiere pop songtress for an entire generation.  Whole true her popularity has waxed and waned and her over-the-top, domineering sexuality has left some listeners turning a cold ear to her music.  However, through it all she crafted some of the finest recorded pop music ever.  And this collection, the 2 disc version, is the celebration of all things Madonna.    Taken as a whole, with it's unchoronological track order, \\"Celebration\\" is as perfect as pop music can get.  Madonna's knack for adding her own special sound, her unique sensibility to her work is as strong as ever.  The addition of the two new tracks, \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" find Madonna exerting her presence over the beats that are farmed from two different genres and two different productioh teams. From the dance floor haven of the title track to the love is a battlefield groove of \\"Revolver\\"--Madonna still reigns as the Queen of Pop.  Both tracks fit nicely into the pantheon that is \\"34 Songs That Changed The World\\"      Fans can dissect and analyze the songs included; what mixes weren't used and how much better a certain track, a bigger \\"hit\\" would have been.  Granted the album is decidedly dance track heavy, but Madonna's knack for filling up the dance floor at any club (gay or straight) is partly responsible for her longevity as an artist.  The album's art direction (done wonderfully by Mr. Brainwash) also pay hommage to Madonna's iconic imagery, something that Madonna herself is keen on using in all the various forms of her performance.  Even without a logo or title, anyone could walk by that record just sitting there on the store self and know who that woman is glancing back at them.    The sound of the tracks on the album is crisp and clear.  With many of the older tracks benefiting from the remastering process.  However, oddly enough, the sets new track \\"Revolver\\" sounds muffled and heavy.  It has a very rough feel to it which may or may not be intentional.  To balance that out, older songs like \\"Who's That Girl\\", \\"Cherish\\" and \\"Burning Up\\" are given a new life on this album and I'm sure many people who may have forgetten this singles will gladly re-embrace them all over again.    No \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection is perfect.  Especially for someone like Madonna, who has had a career that is spanning into 30 years.  Some of your favorite tracks may not be included and certain mixes presented may not suit your personal taste--but as a whole \\"Celebration\\" is just that.  A reminder of what made Madonna into the living legend she is today.

It's strange that this resurgence coincides with the Military Channel's airing of \\"The World at War\\" which pictures Anne in the opening song amongst the flames.

B00004TJWE|5.0|Despite debate, it is really no matter what the first concept album is. Some say Sgt Pepper, others Tommy. For me, it is actually Sinatra's 1954 [[ASIN:B000006OHD In the Wee Small Hours]].<br /><br />Regardless, S.F. Sorrow is one great album--so great it gave Pete Townsted inspiration to write Tommy. Sorrow is full of 1960s psychadelic folk and rock by the Pretty Things. The music may have an accustic base, but is rigoroursly written, full of mellotrons, weird, spooky stops, and  guitars that are played like exotic instruments. The album does not have raga or far eastern instruments, but it sure is given that feel.<br /><br />The vocals are also fantastic as is the playing. To think the Pretty Things were playing basic garage rock only a year or two before this boggles the mind--their writing, playing, and invention makes quick and giant leaps here.<br /><br />Some of the sounds are muddy, and you can tell this was recorded right before bands--except for the Beatles--really figured out how to use a studio. But musically, SF Sorrow has no superior in rock

One thing I would like to mention is that the story is quite gruesome and I do not feel it is suitable for those under 18. Its too close to reality.
B00000DD1S|4.0|This double Albert Ayler live set is gripping for a few reasons. It uses a violin, which was done by Cecil Taylor and many other free jazz players in the 1970s; but when this was recorded in the late 1960s, the violin in was almost unheard of in the genre.<br /><br />Second. this album juxtaposes some of the most avant gaurde jazz with some of the oldest and most traditional. The album can, very generally, be devided into two relms--almost completey free form jams and New Orleans style marches. Through it all, Ayler mantains his gruff tenor tone--this is sure not the immaculate shine of Coltrane.<br /><br />This is almost the same comprehensive jazz stance Archie Shepp was taking at the time. But Ayler divides it a little more, where Shepp often intigrated this into the same song or song suite. Still, on the dixielandesqe material on this set, the interaction between players is a lot more harmonically free than in 1920s New Orleans jazz.<br /><br />But bullocks the academics. This album is a viceral delight full of colors and texutres and is a must for free jazz fans. It is hard to beleive in a short time, Ayler would be playing funk on [[ASIN:B000AMJEBO New Grass]]<br /><br />HATS OFF TO ME. MY 1000TH REVIEW.
0307588335|1.0|What is billed as a tale of the fall of Lehman Brothers is in fact a poorly-written, self-serving memoir of a junior trader of convertible securities at the firm. Written with hindsight, his (and his colleagues') observations and predictions were all spot on while the rest of the firm floundered in stupidity.<br /><br />The book is filled with inaccurate descriptions of non-Lehman events, garbled to just-wrong descriptions of financial instruments and reports, and tough-guy trader talk. If this is what he's written with the assistance of a 'New York Times best-selling' ghostwriter, I shudder to think what his own manuscript must've looked like. Some editor at Crown apparently chose not to read or fact check much of anything before publication.<br /><br />Apparently the author made a fair amount of money for Lehman and for himself during his short time there. Too bad he didn't stop while he was ahead.

Some of my favorite works were music I'd never heard before but that I wished was a little longer in time so I could relish the spell he casts.<br />A great value for two CDs of great music.
0446567337|1.0|I will just say this: if the characters of John and Savannah loved each other as much as they showed/said, then events would NEVER have unfolded the way they did. Without giving to much away, it was like the author just wanted to set up the bleakest most depressing ending he could think of for John, even if it didn't jive with the characters or the rest of the story.     SPOILER    Savannah never would have married Tim-it was just a cheap trick and lame plot device meant to depress the reader, and on some level it worked because I totally felt terrible when I finished. She even admits she loves John more then him, yet she couldn't wait a little longer? And the whole coin collection being sold to treat Tim's convenient illness was just so phoney. Again, just another manipulative plot device trying to tug our heartstrings that was so unbelievable by that point.     I actually felt angry that I wasted my time. I could have got behind this book if it didn't become so contrived, because the John character was very likable!

0843175621|4.0|'Mr. Bounce' is either a short but entertaining picture book, or alternately a metaphor for the artist whose visionary nature makes it hard for him to fit in with the world around him. Mr. Bounce, disturbed by constant uncontrolled bouncing, goes to a doctor (representing the bourgeois rationalist mindset) who gives him a heavy pair of boots to stop him bouncing. But the boots lead to his downfall as an artist - they are so heavy that he crashes through the floorboards.<br /><br />Conclusion: artists should never listen to the advice of the rationalist types who seek to restrain their spirit. It's better to bounce unpredictably than crash through the floor like a ball of lead. But better still is the artist who has learned to CONTROL his bouncing, like Goethe, and that is what Mr. Bounce should have tried to do. Sadly, he chose to listen to a two-bit doctor instead.<br /><br />You may also enjoy [[ASIN:145649967X Time Struggle 1: The Wolves of Odin (Volume 1)]].
1593072937|4.0|There are precious few of them in Frank Miller's \\"Sin City, the Hard Goodbye\\" but I can't help but imagining what the fantastic art would be like if there weren't any words at all. In other words (haha), imagine a \\"silent\\" graphic novel, like a silent movie, where you have to supply the narrative. I'd prefer making up my own story to go along with the pictures, I think, to the story that Miller gives us here, which is really quite a cliche--a classic of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy kills everyone who caused him to lose girl.<br /><br />Well, there are a few (slightly) original twists.<br /><br />The whore with the heart of gold is revealed to be motivated by pure practical opportunism, the knight in shining armor is, in reality, more than less a homicidal brute, the lost \\"love\\" that he sets out to avenge reveals him to be a monster deserving of a good deal of pity, and the explosive ending is less than happy, even if the bad guys get their just desserts. Overall, though, this first volume of \\"Sin City\\" is basically worth looking at more than it is worth reading. It's Miller's stark, black-and-white, woodcut-style renderings of a gritty evil world that set his work apart from the pack of hardboiled stories from which it would be otherwise indistinguishable. Miller's graphics are immediate, undeniably visceral; they don't just compliment the story, such as it is, they raise it a couple of levels above the run-of-the-mill dreck that it actually is.<br /><br />Well, Marv is a good character--kind of an Incredible Hulk with severe psychological problems. He has to pop pills to remain \\"normal.\\" Normal, that is, for Marv, which isn't any too normal. For Marv, normal seems to mean that he'll kill anyone at any time for almost any reason...except for girls. And Miller's villains are more than suitably evil and every bit deranged enough to be a match for Marv. And these characters inhabit a world that is too dark to admit even a spark of light except for that emitted from the barrel of a gun when a bad guy is blown to kingdom come.<br /><br />In any event, \\"Sin City, the Hard Goodbye\\" is nowhere near as nuanced and intelligent as, say, \\"The Watchmen,\\" but visually it is more beautiful, more powerful, and more raw. Visually, it is a masterpiece of darkness. I can't say its graphic style is unforgettable, not yet anyway, since I just finished reading it, and my memory isn't that bad. It may be thought. Visually, it's that compelling. But as stories go, it's pretty one-dimensional.when a bad guy is blown to kingdom come.

0143117025|4.0|Arthur Conan Doyle certainly shows his skills as a great short story and mystery writer in this collection of THE definitive detective of literature: Sherlock Holmes.  The stories are engaging and it is both fun and challenging to try to solve the case at the same time Holmes does, even if you fail.  But if you start reading this book looking for the same action as was in the recent movie, you will be very disappointed.  Most of the pages are consumed by the concerned individual telling the story while Holmes listens and deduces everything almost instantly and in near total silence.  In fact, most cases are solved in Holmes' parlor without Holmes ever having to really go out and look for clues.  Also, Dr. Watson does seem like the stereotypical lapdog who fawns at Holmes' deductive powers to near sycophantic levels rather than a character with his own valuable assests in most cases.  But don't let these criticisms deter you.  They are very small points in my mind and these tales are paragons of both short stories and mysteries.  Lovers of either or both should pick this up immediately.

1594488843|4.0|Subtitled \\"The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,\\" I must confess that this excellent book did not \\"surprise\\" me at all. That is not to take anything away from Pink's conclusions, however. Simply stated, \\"there's a gap between what science knows and business does.\\" Recounting early research that demonstrated clearly that the \\"carrot and stick\\" approach actually causes more damage than good, Pink makes a strong case for the need for a Motivation 3.0, where the reward is the activity itself (Motivation 1.0 was all about survival, Motivation 2.0 used rewards and punishments). Motivation 3.0 aligns itself with Type I personalities (Intrinsic motivation, experiencing what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls \\"flow\\"), while Motivation 2.0 feeds the Type X personality (concerned with rewards). Pink describes the three key components of Motivation 3.0 with clarity and insight, providing practical examples throughout the book. They are 1) Autonomy (in task, time, team and technique), 2) Mastery (a mindset, painful experience and an \\"asymptote\\" - impossible to fully realize), and 3) Purpose (in goals, words and policies).<br /><br />Ever the practical author, Pink completes this excellent book with suggested activities to achieve Type I for individuals, organizations, compensation and parents/teachers. The book closes with a reading list, examples of six business leaders who \\"get it,\\" a recap of his book (even in 140 character \\"twitterese\\") and a glossary of the terms used in his espousal of Motivation 3.O, The reader is even introduced to a site to measure Type I or Type X behavior.<br /><br />A truly exceptional book with extraordinary insights on what constitutes true motivation.
1416562605|5.0|Having visited both North and South India, I found the descriptions in this book accurate!  I could even smell the acrid smoke that seems to cover Northern India in the winter....   Written as a novel, this book gives the visitor an inside look at the workings of India.  It is an amazing country, yet when you visit you have to wonder how India will work it's way out of all the problems.  No drinkable water, intermittent electricity, no sewage treatment, ghastly air pollution, mind boggling poverty  - and yet, India fights against the world's efforts to curtail these problems.  Again and again we read in the papers (following the Copenhagen Climate Conference, 2009) that the US has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of India....    The problem with that argument is that India's pollution (air, water, poverty) has an impact on all the world.   Heaven help us if India's environmental and social standards were to become World standards!  This book is an excellent introduction to India.  I highly recommend it for anyone who has been there (it will bring back memories!), as well as preparation for those who plan to visit.    Jonieta

B00004RJ74|5.0|If you want a movie with a great cast, this is it: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, consistently hilarious Cheech Marin, Juliette Lewis, Fred Williamson, the gorgeous Salma Hayek, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo (who, like Luis Guzman, always makes a movie better), legendary makeup artist Tom Savini (aka Sex Machine), and Kelly Preston even has a bit part!  Some may not be fans of Tarantino as an actor, but there is no denying that the power this cast has easily overshadows Tarantino's limits, and would probably even cover for Keanu Reeves.  Maybe.<br /><br />If you want a visceral gore-fest, this is it: vampire parts fly in gory, green explostions; whole people explode, arms and next get gouged, stakes get rammed, and there's even a scene where Fred Williamson literally rips out a person's heart.  This is a graphically violent film for the lovers of over the top violence.  If your primary reason for watching CSI is SPECIFICALLY to see blood spatter (read: blood showers), then this might be up your alley.<br /><br />If you want a surreal, exploitative movie made explicitly for the thrills, this is it: a Holy Water super-soaker, vampires of all shapes and sizes, a penis-revolver, a shotgun/table leg cross, perhaps the most attractive collection of hookers and dancers ever seen (especially in a grungy P.O.S. bar just over the U.S. - Mexican border), and a corpse guitar are enough to cause a laugh-riot and sensory overload, sure to satiate even the most impatient movie-goer.<br /><br />If you want action-adventure, this is it: Psychopathic and violent, Brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko are wreaking havoc on their way towards a rendezvous with their contact in a run-down Mexican strip-joint/brothel/bar.  Along the way they murder and pillage, then take a family - Jakob Fuller (Keitel), daughter Kate (Lewis), and Jakob's adopted son - hostage to add the tension.  Determining who will survive the ordeal is difficult as is, but when the group finally descends upon the \\"Titty Twister\\" (the bar), and the vampire strippers and truckers begin to show their teeth, the action goes to eleven almost immediately after pulling up a barstool.<br /><br />Add in Tarantino's famous tongue-twisting dialogue and nearly perfect screenplay, direction from Robert Rodriguez that keeps the movie rocking, superb camerawork, extras pouring out of the DVD case (commentary from Tarantino and Rodriguez, music videos, deleted scenes, bios, etc.), and THE most seductive table-top dance scene in movie history (courtesy of Salma Hayek), and the result is one best guilty pleasure movies ever made, and just a great time overall.  I actually pity you if you can't shut the critical analysis portion of your brain off long enough to enjoy this movie.ter\\" (the bar), and the vampire strippers and truckers begin to show their teeth, the action goes to eleven almost immediately after pulling up a barstool.

1400076943|5.0|I read this novel after having read Half of a Yellow Sun, Adichie's other novel, which I loved. Purple Hibiscus was very different- possibly because it was written from the point of view of a child- and yet it was wonderful as well. Adichie's prose is enchanting, engrossing, and uplifting. Her novels draw you in and don't let go even after you have put them down.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|The 2009 version of \\"Star Trek\\" is a \\"re-imagined\\" prequel to the famed Gene Roddenberry TV series from the 1960s.  In this outing, James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) is a hell-raising 23rd Century Iowa farm boy who's tired of living in the shadow of his father, a Starfleet captain who died a hero`s death, sacrificing himself to save the lives of his crew (the infant James and his mother included).  Yet, after just a single pep talk from one Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood), the hotshot Kirk figures it's time to hang up his motorcycle - or the futuristic equivalent thereof - and follow in his hallowed father`s footsteps by becoming a member of Starfleet himself.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on the planet Vulcan, a young Spock suffers persecution for being half-human on his mother's side and, thus, opts to sign on to become a commander with the Earth-based Federation rather than serve in the Vulcan Science Academy, as any decent, civic-minded Vulcan with his kind of aptitude is expected to do.<br /><br />Soon, Kirk and the famously emotionless Spock (Zachary Quinto) are serving together on the maiden voyage of the spanking new Starship Enterprise, along with such familiar faces as Bones (Karl Urban), Uhura (Zoe Saldana), Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin) in their younger years, with Scotty (Simon Pegg) getting a chance to hop aboard later on.  Before they know it, the Enterprise is locked in battle with the Romulans, led by a villain named Nero (Eric Bana), who are trying to make a black hole out of Vulcan, with Earth as their next target.<br /><br />If none of this sounds particularly familiar even to diehard Trek fans, it's probably because scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have concocted a time-shifting/alternate-reality version of events that goes against much of what we've previously been told regarding the back story of these characters.  One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows Leonard Nimoy to join in on the proceedings, playing Spock as an older incarnation of himself.<br /><br />The script has some fun parodying Kirk's reputation for one-upmanship and serial womanizing, but a little of that does go a long way.  Still, the tension that develops between the cocksure Kirk and the similarly adamant Spock (both well played by Pine and Quinto) is nicely balanced against the camaraderie of two equally skilled professionals working at the peak of their abilities in a common cause.<br /><br />Special kudos go to director J.J. Abrams for the tremendously exciting action sequences he has created for this film, including one amazing scene atop a giant drill platform located miles above the planet`s surface.  No surprise, the art direction, production design and special effects are all first-class, and editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon have assembled all the pieces together for maximum impact.<br /><br />This latest incarnation is good fun for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike.self.

B000001GPX|5.0|Not much to add to the many excellent reviews here. Carlos Kleiber sets the standard for Beethoven's 5th and 7th.  What a bargain!
B0001HAISG|3.0|The video is fine, but the company that shipped it is not.  I ordered the wide screen version.  They were out of stock, so instead of letting me know that, they sent the full screen version.  After several emails, they told me to keep it and refunded my money, but I wish they would not assume it to be OK to send something other than what was ordered.
B000001GQ1|5.0|I'm surprised at the number of negative opinions on this performance. Kempff's performance in this recording is understated, beautiful and contemplative. Beethoven was never an one dimensional composer. This is a great recording of some of the greatest piano sonatas ever written.

0553384775|3.0|Everyone in my family has read this book and loved it. I'm a fan of audio books and was given the audio version (which is abridged) and was disappointed that two major events in the book were cut out of the audio version. I was surprised, to say the least and ended up reading the actual book because it was more comprehensive.    Overall I found it to be a quick read but I was very disappointed in the audio version being shortened.

B0001I55OC|1.0|Ok so if you have never read the book then you might like this movie.  However if you have read the book then you will hate this movie.  i had read bad reviews about the movie but liked the book so much i said i'll give it a chance, i mean how bad can it be.  Well Really bad was my answer.  whoever wrote the screen play for this movie i dont think ever read the book.  its more like he read the back of the book and said ok thats all the info i need.  bottom line great book bad movie.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|This set is the first season of the Clone Wars series that was    shown on Cartoon Network.    A few of the shows are directors cuts which    vary a little bit from the original version.    The producer's reels for every episode are fun to watch.    You have to select \\"play by episode\\" to get to these.    I suggest you watch the show then watch the producer's reel.

B002ECEEGS|3.0|I guess this is what is going for chick-lit these days, and if so, well, I enjoyed the story.  There certainly is no depth to the story; just your average story of three 20-somethings who make a pact to change the course of their lives.  Sure the women are shallow and the storyline is predictable, but this isn't supposed to be award winning writing, is it?  It read like it could be a movie starring the current Hollywood it-girls.  Get it from the library.
0545140315|4.0|Penny Lane, so named because of her parents' Beatles obsession, is sick of every boy except the four responsible for her namesake. So while she'll still listen to Beatles music, she's sworn off boys. That means no more dating and instead dedicating her time to herself. And so Penny becomes the first member of The Lonely Hearts Club (named because of the only boys allowed), but soon, everyone wants to know about it. It turns out, Penny's not the only girl fed up with letting boys be boys, and before long, girls are flocking to her growing club. It's about empowerment and not letting the other sex get in the way of real life. But despite all the good things the club has been doing for its members, Penny can't help but wonder if her original assumption, that all males are spawns of the devil, is really true and if not dating is really the way to go. Because despite how many times Penny tells herself that boys will only break her heart, there's still one boy Penny can't help but like.    The Lonely Hearts Club doubles as a sweet romantic comedy and a self empowerment book for all girls. Eulberg gets down to business quickly by listing nearly all the transgressions guys have made against girls. It's practically a universally known fact that a girl will sometimes do anything to get a guy, usually to her own detriment, as shown through Tracy's and Diane's characters. Penny's character offers an interesting solution to this: swear off boys and everything will be better. Of course, things rarely turn out as planned, and this heartwarming story is the result. I just love how Eulberg encourages girls to become independent from boys and take back their lives while also entertaining them with a cute and amusing tale. I wouldn't say anything else in particular really stands out about this novel; the Beatles tributes and even the storyline have been tried before. Nonetheless, The Lonely Hearts Club is sure to bring a smile and a little hope into every girl's life.    The Lonely Hearts Club appeals to teen girls who enjoy young adult romance stories including Audrey, Wait! by Robin Benway and The ABC's of Kissing Boys by Tina Ferraro.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|I finally managed to get my hands on this set yesterday on my birthday. Now I must admit the only parts I have watched so far is the Floyd set from Live 8 on Disc 3 and the Pink Floyd Rehearsal Extra Feture from Disc 4. That however is more than enough to make this dics a required purchase for any Floyd fan. I just got done watching the rehearsal extra and I am so glad that I did. They performed just the four of them \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and at the end of the song Gilmour/Waters/Mason discussed how the song should end and redid it a couple of times. It is very sad to think that we will never again see the classic lineup play together with the passing of Richard Wright in 2008. I know everyone always talks about David Gilmour and Roger Waters but Richard was also a very integral part of Floyd. Anyways, this show was spectacular and I wish I was there. I only hope that Gilmour and Waters can reconcile and perform again. I'm sure the rest of the DVD is also good. There are a lot of great acts. Looking forward to checking out Muse with \\"Time is Running Out\\" I have heard that there is an additional DVD that can be purchased that has additional songs from Muse so I moght look for that next. Pretty sure it was a Live 8 Paris DVD. Just looking over the cover and book it appears there is something for everyone and I highly recommend purchasing this set.

Can they solve the maze and escape and why are they there to begin with?<br />James Dashner has written a well executed story with \\"The Maze Runner\\". It is filled with many questions, intense drama and enough action to keep this reader not wanting to out the book down. I was a little let down by the climax, but then he comes back with an ending that pulled me in to get the next book of this trilogy.
B000BYA5GO|3.0|The acting is good, sometimes excellent. Both Nicholas Cage and Jared Leto do a good job. Even Cage's dark witty cynicism is sometimes brilliant. The problem about this film is that it is obvioulsy one-sided or one-dimensional. The plot is poor, as it doesn't show reality from a wide perspective. There are some plain statements that one has to consider before making a film about war in general and about wars waged in the XX century in particular:  a) Arms are sold because someone buys them. Obvious but true. Therefore, those who buy weapons are as guilty as those who provide them. Just like drugs. And, like drugs or any other good, arms are ruled by the laws of market, a simple question of supply and demand.  b) The film centers on Western Africa conflicts, in particular Sierra Leona and Liberia (curious that the most brutal genocide in Africa, that of Rwanda, doesn't have a single scene), pretending to make us believe that the source of all evil is arm dealing. Well, let's point out again what is also obvious, that these African wars, like the Yugoslavian-Balkan wars, like the Osetia-Abjasia-Georgia war, like the Armenia-Azerbajan war, have an ETHNIC root, mainly caused by an ethnic (tribal in Africa) disruption that destroyed the territorial balance imposed by colonial powers or totalitarian regimes like the Soviet Union. Therefore, massive arm dealing is a symptom, not a cause, of the state of countries on the verge of war or already plunged into war or civil conflict. Thus, arms are always an element of wars, tactically essential indeed, but never the cause of them nor the reason for them.  Having said this, I don't think it's very honest to awaken consciences or be lectured on false premises.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|great movie of course, but cannot say enough about the 4-disc combo.  we have 1 blu-ray player and multiple dvd players.  it's great to have so many format options in one purchase.  absolutely worth it.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The DVD's as well as the box they were in, were practically NEW.  Excellent conditions.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|What a mind-expanding film this is, not only by providing insight into a range of Japanese values and traditions, but as a reminder of the ephemereality of life, the inevitablility of death, and the need for us to be good to ourselves and to and with others while we're still around to do anything about those things.  The film's haunting, methodical pace is hypnotic.  Buttressed by superb acting and expressiveness by even the lesser players, the film evokes the strongest emotions in the viewer.  For example, the scene where the encoffiners gracefully and patiently transform an elderly deceased lady into a visage of her beautiful youth - and her husband reacts to that - will leave few unmoved.
031606792X|5.0|this book is really three books in one...Bella and Edward consumate their love, Jacob finds his place in their relationship, the vampire threat is removed.  Stephanie Meyer may have considered this a four book saga but she left many story lines open for further books

0143037757|5.0|Very few folks have the courage or the skill to write this kind of all-encompassing modern history.  Judt's skill is even more impressive in that the early chapters on immediate postwar Europe are written with the same style and energy as the ending chapters on the Treaty of Rome and Bush/Iraq.  The themes of the book (What is Europe?  What is East vs What is West?) are expertly handled as the answers change from 1945 to 1956 to 1968 to 1989 to 2005.  Highly Recommended.
0439023491|5.0|I really liked Hunger Games and was anxious for this books release.  Suzanne Collins wrote an amazing follow-up that keeps you on the edge of your seat and holding your breath until the last page.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|It was great to find a supplier that offered this product at such an exceptional price.  It was virtually 1/2 the price of my local retailers and it allowed me the opportunity to purchase other items on my son's wish list.  Thank you for offering such great values through Amazon.com.  Item was brand new and shipped in a very expeditious manner. It was also under the \\"shipped free\\" umbrella offer which made it even that much better.  I am definitely a return customer.
B00275EGWY|5.0|I got the movie when I saw it in the new releases. I had never heard of it but thought it looked interesting so I got it.    After watching it, I couldn't believe that I had never heard of it. It was just amazing. Some people criticize it for accuracy but then what movie is 100% accurate? They criticize the idea that the main character is reckless and they assume they're stereotyping all EOD personnel. The problem with these comments is that members in his unit constantly criticize him. One made a comment along the lines of \\"The only reason I got shot is because you're an adrenaline junkie.\\" So I would ignore any comments that say \\"That's not how soldiers act.\\"    It really opens your eyes and make you appreciate what military personnel go through over there. It shows you how alert they have to be, the stress they go through, and even gives an example of how being naive for 1 minute can cost you your life.    I told a marine friend of mine he needs to see it. He said \\"Way ahead of you. Great movie.\\"
B00275EGWY|5.0|Not since 'Platoon' has another war picture put the viewer inside a soldiers head and in the heart of the action. 'The Hurt Locker' is more about the man inside the uniform than just another patriotic war piece. Jeremy Renner who I have only seen in a few films does a fantastic job as an adrenaline junkie bomb disarmer who's taste for deadly excitement has more than one of his squad a little nervous. This could have been a ridiculous \\"Hollywood\\" film, but instead becomes a psychological study of what it takes to do this kind of thing on a daily basis.<br /><br />This is one of the best war films I've seen in a long time and is well worth your time. 'The Hurt Locker' delivers in spades!
B001E75QH0|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 10 year old son and he loves it. It is a must have if you are an Indiana Jones fan or even if you are a classics lover.  Great picture quality.
B001FB55I0|2.0|***CONTAINS SPOILERS***<br /><br />With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got two stars from me instead of one.<br /><br />I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His [[ASIN:B001GZ6QEC Dark Knight]] performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.<br /><br />If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) - a man from the past awakened in the future - has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the \\"humans.\\" With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin, [[ASIN:B001AVCFK6 Star Trek]]), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is \\"The Big Question\\" that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes \\"The Right Choice.\\"<br /><br />In addition to being a clich&eacute;, the movie even reinvents a scene from [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day]] in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people!<br /><br />The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really.audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes \\"The Right Choice.\\"     In addition to being a cliché, the movie even reinvents a scene from [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2: Judgment Day]] in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|EXCELLENT movie. Pretty graphic blood and guts. If that bothers you, pick another flick. Otherwise, this is a classic. You need to get past Pitt's bad Southern Accent in the beginning, but by mid-movie it really grows on you. He plays a great role, as does his supporting cast. Great twist for a conclusion. I'll watch it again. Looks awesome in Blu ray.
0316044938|4.0|I had to read the book when I saw the intriguing movie trailers. When I read the first reviews of the movie, I knew I'd need a bit more detail than a bunch of disjointed flashbacks, so I read the paperback. I was shocked to find myself plunged into Susie Salmon's world and death and in ways, gained insight into my own behavior and life.  My husband was present during the Vietnam War when a couple of his buddies were killed by a woman and a small child while they were on patrol near a small village on the South China Sea. These deaths and others haunted my husband, but he didn't talk about them--- at least not a lot---until we went to see a movie in 2002 that reawakened his nightmare. He was terribly full of guilt, sadness and remorse--classic signs of PTSD and unresolved grief. He was upset because he felt he owed it to each man's family to talk with them, memorialize their service, and honor them. He didn't realize how little information he could recall about each of them and how much time had passed. I agreed to help him. It took over six years to act on this impulse and actually make direct contact. And although it helped my husband to finally put these poor souls to rest in his mind, I was surprised at the level of anger, hurt, distrust, and unbearable grief that each family still had. None of them had coped and 'moved on' with their lives. I realized after reading this book, that perhaps they can't. And that is ok. I found myself unwittingly holding pieces of information that sometimes could do more harm than any possible good. But, to be honest, Not all seemed relieved to be able to speak their loved one's name again, to share photos and last memories. Waves of dysfunction rippled from each family and I was acutely aware of the fragile emotions, the clumsy attempts to heal each other, and the damage that can be done if someone approaches a family member the wrong way.   It is a comfort to know that (at least in this author's mind) heaven does exist. That lifegoes on after death. That although life and death are separate, that there may be a spiritual realm and that we may interface with it more than we realize.  As a nurse, I have seen, on more than one occasion, something that looked like a spirit when death occurred. I can describe these times with accuracy and one time, a whole group witnessed the same thing as I did so I know I was not hallucinating. But I cannot replicate what I saw---and it doesn't always happen, so I have no way to explain this paranormal experience, but just to say I know. I can also tell you, that in the case of one of the young men who were with my husband, I could sense his spirit and especially on days that were important to him, I think he prompted me and others to try to reach his widow. I did, but I found her shattered. One miracle after another to prove his undying love happened, but she was unwilling to talk about him, look at his photo, or even talk with either my husband or myself by phone. She willed herself to stay stuck in her grief.  I can understand now why she is so guarded.   I think all people who've recently loved someone might benefit from this book as they journey through the stages of grief toward some level of uneasy acceptance.  I also think that through the author, we can see that there are all kinds of justice........that Susie Salmon, did get a form of justice in the end---just by being. The legal eagles and police may fail us, and evil people can sometimes escape punishment in this life, but not necessarily forever. For those of you with a perverted bent or those who laugh at our justice system, remember just how powerful a little girl like Susie Salmon was and that all of the sickness in the world couldn't break her spirit. We ALL reap what we sow in this life. Thank God for icicles!
1400082773|4.0|I have to admit that half way through this book I was getting anxious to be done reading it.  It does feel somehow naive in parts, especially at the beginning.  But now that I have just finished it, I would say it is definitely worth reading, and would be even if the guy that wrote it hadn't gone on to become an American President.<br /><br />The book is divided into 3 sections and an epilogue.  The first, which recounts Obama's childhood in Hawaii (and a couple years in Indonesia), was the least interesting to me.  The second section is about his experiences as a community organizer in Chicago, before going to law school.  I found the stories in this section especially interesting, and was impressed by his dedication and faith that his efforts and investments were worthwhile.  The third section covers Obama's first visit to Kenya.  I was afraid that this section would idealize Africa too much, but I think it actually did a good job of presenting the cultural conflicts (values of colonialism/Western world vs. tribalism) in a concise way without smoothing over the complexities of the issues.<br /><br />While the book is really presented as a search for identity as a black man in America, I think the themes have much broader application.  Who are any of us?  Is there really such a thing as a pure cultural identity anymore?  Personally, I am an American married to a German.  Our daughter was born in Switzerland and we currently live in Dubai.  She will grow up speaking English and German, and if we are here long enough, Arabic.  Maybe this is a great gift we are giving her--to be comfortable in so many cultures, but it also might have her asking where her home really is.  I liked Obama's ultimate approach of taking the good from each of his cultural backgrounds, and leaving behind the bad.  I also liked the theme implicit in the epilogue that your community--where-ever it is you invest, regardless of geography--is where you are from.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|The whole time I've been reading this book, I've been so inspired. Especially after just watching Avatar. I think we strayed away from our intended path. To read such a book that takes you to a land of hope, beauty, respect, APPRECIATION and miracles is a breath of fresh air. It's a strong realization that we have relieved our brains of such miraculous feats and strong understanding and put that obligation into the hands of machines.     To everyone with a negative feedback...I feel sorry that you cant see light in your dark corner. I'm guessing that you also gave \\"The Lost Symbol\\" bad feedback as well. It had small hints of miracles. The way of the Aborigines is comparable to Dr. Solomon's theory of Noetic Science. I'm so frustrated that more people in this world would rather bash something beautiful before they would consider it an enlightenment.  If the book carried the label of Non-Fiction, I could see how one would side-note that.  However, this is a fictional book. Even if it was non-fictional it is still a beautiful world to live in for the duration of your read. Whether you carry this light with you is your decision. Open your mind people. We are all afraid of what we dont understand. So, what do we do? We kill it. That's nonsense and inhuman.     \\"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.\\" ~Albert Einstein     Overall: This book is beautiful and brilliant. It will shed light to areas that you have never thought deeply about. (ex. Why do we have birthdays?) If you're in touch with yourself and your thoughts extend further than this earth...you'll highly enjoy this read!
6304698690|5.0|The Secret Garden is a wonderful movie - beautiful, touching, and heartwarming.  There is enough to keep an adult interested, although it appeals to children, too.  The music and cinematography are superb.  This is definitely one movie everyone should have in their DVD library.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This is a made for TV Movie starring Tom Selleck perfectly cast as Jesse Stone, a former L.A. Homicide detective.  Robert Parker has written four Jesse Stone novels.<br /><br />Jesse would be about 40 and Selleck fits the character perfectly, like a glove.<br /><br />Jesse has left Los Angeles and big city life to take a job as police chief of a quiet, quaint New England town called Paradise, Massachusetts.  He is divorced and a heavy drinking womanizer who misses his former wife.  He still has not gotten over her after five years, even though they keep in touch by phone.  He keeps his old habits of drinking and womanizing, but has committed to the new job.  When several murders happen on his watch, he is forced to deal with his past.  He is tough and yet has a good heart and through the difficult times he finds the inner strength to solve the crimes.<br /><br />Even though Tom Selleck carries the movie, all the actors pull their weight to make this a riveting murder mystery.  It is well worth the watch.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This show is my favorite guilty pleasure of all! I can't get enough of it! Michael C. Hall is at the top of his game, with his haunting monolouges and incredible performance. All the cast is brilliantly matched with individual characters that would leave you to believe thats their true persona. A chilling score sets the show on edge, makes it tense, and just plain makes it fun. This show is worth any amount of money to own. BUY IT NOW!!!
B00275EGX8|4.0|Set in the Iraq War, the movie is based on first hand observations of Mark Boal, who was embedded with a special bomb unit in Iraq.<br /><br />The story focuses on Staff Sergeant James, (Jeremy Remer) head of an elite squad of soldiers with a mission to protect and save by disarming bombs of all kinds.  It is not easy and the war zone is full of terrorists, assassins, suicide bombers homemade/improvised bombs.<br /><br />In 2004, Staff Sergent James takes over the squad after they lost their team leader on a mission.  When James takes over he does not follow the military rules and protocol.  He gets the job done and is recognized as \\"wild\\" by a superior who asks how many bombs he has disarmed.  The only part of the movie that did not ring true was when he said \\"843 bombs disarmed\\"  - that did not seem realistic, when the margin of error is zero and the variety of bombs.  The bomb team has only 38 days left in their tour of Iraq and the count-down of days on the screen show situation after ungodly situation where their lives are a hair breath away from death.  The movie holds your attention with deep emotional intensity and action packed scene after scene.  We finally come to understand why Jeremy flirts with death - to feel alive.  A regular life is boring and unmeaning to him.<br /><br />The filming is realistic and it clearly shows the hot, dry, dreary, primitive conditions the soldiers deal with.  The rigors of fighting a half world away, far from the luxuries of home are clearly defined.  After watching you respect even more the psychological, physical and human sacrifice American soldiers face.
B000002UEB|4.0|A little jumbled, but overall quite good. Not a fan of the lead singers vocal style, but I'll get over that. If you like concept albums than feast until you explode. Enjoy!
B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I finally gave in and decided to buy this set.  I am absolutely glad I went ahead with the purchase.  I have not been disappointed with any of the discs yet.  Every time I pop one into the tray, I am pleasantly surprised by the way Bertini brings out certain details that make the whole experience enjoyable.  How much do I like this set? So much that I now have two sets.  One to keep with me at home and one that I can lend out to friends.

0786939532|5.0|I was lucky enough to be introduced to Drizzt by a passionate fan. When I was at a local bookstore on a rainy Saturday, a fellow customer commented about how many truly great fantasy books there are. SO good, that he had read nearly everything that caught his eye. I, on the other hand was getting back into fantasy books after a VERY long absence. Although this customer had read quite a lot, I had not, at least not for a while.<br /><br />When I mentioned I was reading The Hobbit, he asked if I had read the Lord of the Rings, I said I had, but again, that it had been a long time. I said I was looking for stories of the same sort, but ones with a real strong lead character. This is when the customer referred me to Drizzt Do'Urden, and the tales of the drow elves. He suggested to start off with HOMELAND.<br /><br />RA Salvatore writes Drizzt passionately, and with purpose. A drow elf that defies the livestyle of his people, because he knows they're not right. More than just a simple fantasy adventure, HOMELAND introduces you to Drizzt, and the world he comes from. Including his twisted mother, and power hungry sisters, and his powerful but misguided brothers. His only friends, A beloved teacher and a mystical panther.<br /><br />All in all, HOMELAND is simply fantastically written, the drow city, Menzoberranzan, Drizzt's home, is a dark and evil place. With Spiders acting as gods, guards, they adorn the walls and elements all around the city (there are arachnid elements in everything from statues, to pottery, to weapons.) The only light being cast is the results of magic performed daily by drow wizards. Within the well crafted chapters you begin to clearly understand the dark drow city in which Drizzt lives, and the reasons why the concious driven Drizzt does not belong. The dark, opportunistic drow stand in opposition of the nobel prince, and everything that he is. Menzoberranzan and the horrors that lie outside the relative safety of the city are written with amazing detail.<br /><br />In Drizzt you see familiar human themes, as in life we all have compromise, sometimes because of who we are, or where we're from. Sometimes we even know when the lives we are destined for cant be the only way to live.  Drizzt proves this in more than one battle, and in more than one confrontation with his twisted sinister family. His quiet confidence in his natural talents is fantastically written.<br /><br />Will Drizzt win in the end? Well read HOMELAND to see. I can say this, he learns a lot, grows up, gains a friend and has a major loss, and this is all in book one...of thirteen! RA Salvatore, and his beloved drow elf have gained yet another fan....ME!! My special thanks to the stranger that lead me to this very enjoyable series!you see familiar human themes, as in life we all have compromise, sometimes because of who we are, or where we're from.

0312997221|3.0|This is my third attempt at Forsyth after Fist and Jackyl. Jackyl is simply the best thriller I've ever read and Fist was too long and had too much exposition. This one is somewhere in between. The first part is incredibly tightly written, but part two goes overboard into exposition, reviewing history lessons about things I already know. It's paragraph after paragraph of basic modern history, with the only reward being the occasional quip at each paragraph's end. It's distracting and the time should have been used in other ways. Still, it is a fun read, but there will never be another Jackyl.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|James Cameron's movies are never short of special affects and big ideas, but they tend to lack a distinct depth of character and once the initial \\"WOW!!!! That was sure innovative and action packed and visually stunning!\\"  you kind of begin to wonder what makes his movies so special.  Maybe it is the idea that innovations are still possible, and a simple and stereotypical story of love and faith can make it in a day and age where everything has \\"already been done.\\"  Whatever the reasons may be, Avatar is a wonder to behold while it is on the screen indeed, in much the same way Titanic was.<br /><br />  It always makes me feel jaded in my group of friends because I am one of the few people who tend to veer away from big blockbusters, this is not to say I do not enjoy them, I always hope they'll be better than my expectations when I see them, but they rarely are.  \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\" is a great example, my friends loved the first movie, which I only found it mildy amusing, and figured that the sequel would be utter garbage, especially based on Michael Bay's reputation for making sequels, bigger, louder, shorter on character, smaller on plot, and higher on the special effects and stupidity.  It is at least nice to see that Avatar doesn't expect its audience to lower its intelligence quite as much.<br /><br />  Having taken cultural anthropology, it was nice to see a movie where the the characters go in to a new world where we actually get to see things from an anthropological point of view that isn't a documentary or a completely brainy movie, by this, I mean, its nice to see a blockbuster that attempts to show the importance of the preservation of cultures.  At the same time, Cameron definitely gets a little bit too carried away with the culture and their pseudo religious belief's.  It definitely becomes pretty apparent what generation he is from, not that this is a bad thing, but in real life, people are more complicated then this.  No one is completely and blindly devoted to a cause as the characters in this movie without a real underlying reason and the arch-nemesis in this movie, although entertaining, was irritating because it was never explained why he really wanted to extinct these people except for a mineral called \\"Unobtanium\\", seriously.<br /><br />  Now, I am all for good versus evil, but I am not sure this was so much a battle of good versus evil as it was agenda vs. agenda and Cameron shoving his agenda down our throats by the way of a giant innovative 3D epic.  The movies central ideas of preserving culture and meeting where they are at are timeless, but the characters are unrealistic, and it is just hard to believe a lot of their actions at times.<br /><br />  Overall though, thanks to Sigourney Weaver and seamless special effects, this movie does somehow work. I enjoyed it, but I was still wishing it is was more than it was, and if this movie expects to be a successful trilogy it will have a deliver a lot more than great special effects the next time around.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyly and blindly devoted to a cause as the characters in this movie without a real underlying reason and the arch-nemesis in this movie, although entertaining, was irritating because it was never explained why he really wanted to extinct these people except for a mineral called \\"Unobtanium\\", seriously.

B001B7CNY2|2.0|Pros:  The picture and audio quality was superb.    Great special effects.    Cons:  I thought the script was terrible.  This WW2 sub film had all the typical \\"sub\\" plots like running silent, taking it deeper, engineers fixing leaks, and sending up an oil slick and debris field including a dead body. The unusual twists were utterly unbelievable.    Recommend U571 for a Net Flix rental and buy something else.
B00004YX39|5.0|This like most Steely Dan Albums is a masterpiece. In my humble opinion it represents the band at their most technical best. The songs are well written and brilliantly executed. While Deacon Blues is probably my favorite Steely tune among their outstanding catalog. It is not on this one it's on Aja as many of you already know, however as far as an album goes this one is nearly flawless despite occasionally showing some of its 1980 vintage it is never the less timeless. If you like Steely buy this one with confidence. If you are a casual listener that wants a great general collection of the Dan buy The Definitive Collection.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|Firstly I was thrown off that Mary Smith had not stayed with Miss Matty and that she had a disappointment? Was it the Dr.that made her glasses from the first series? It was not explained and it was irritating. Then she turns around and leaves again!<br /><br />I didn't like the way Martha was killed off and I think they only did it to send Jem and Tilly away so they could come back in a so called \\"magical ending.\\" Miss Matty's brother Peter was portrayed by a different actor and he seemed flat to me and what happened to that twinkle in his eye he had for Miss Pole?<br /><br />Also, where were the doctors in this story? I found it unlikely that Dr. Harrison would leave after marrying a local(Sophie Hutton).So Cranford is left without a doctor which seemed so inconsistent to me. Not to mention the fact that the Reverend her father played a more substantial role here and he never mentioned the newlyweds nor was he ever seen with the two younger siblings. I find it hard to believe Sophie would leave them.<br />By contrast, the butcher's children are seen and mentioned by Caroline Tompkins' sister, but where was she and her new husband? There was only a vague hint as to why they were in her sister's care so much.<br /><br />I was also looking forward to the development between Harry Gregson, Lady Ludlow and her son Lord Septimus. Mr. Carter's will was a masterpiece. Septimus finally comes back only she is dead and in a rather ridiculous way at that. I looked for a deeper connection to Harry Gregson as he is heir to a fortune and is to become educated and a gentlemen. Instead she is brought back as a frail old lady and promptly killed off. I also thought it faintly silly that Harry's family is displaced by the railway, leaves to join the father and doesn't contact him. Miss Galindo knows where they went since she spoke with his mother before she left, but Harry is seemingly left homeless? Although not in full possession of his fortune, I couldn't help but think he would have been able find them, bring them back and provide for them and once he again he could have that home away from school. It was a mountain made out of a molehill.<br />Altogether it seemed as if improbable events were set in place just to get the story where the writer wanted it to go. I did enjoy seeing the cow again in her clothes although they killed her off too and in the most gruesome way! As always I enjoyed Judi Dench as Miss Matty and Imelda Staunton as Miss Pole was much needed comic relief.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 part installment of Cranford and was utterly enchanted with it.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|Being a Slayer fan since \\"Hell Awaits\\", I must say this one blew my mind! I stopped buying Slayer after \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\" as I felt(still feel) there was no topping that album. I personally felt they got a little hard/dark for me (yes, I said it). Went to their website and saw the new album with Dave!!! I put the headphones on and listened to the album. All the elements are back again.   Bought it immediately. I'll be cleaning some house with this one, ha!   A good mix of \\"Reign in Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\" and \\"Seasons in the Abyss\\".   Not a bad combination if you ask me...my favorite albums.   (Tom screaming in the beginning of \\"Angel of Death\\" makes me smile still to this day.)
0810979772|4.0|I bought this and two of the other wimpy kid books for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas.  About 20 minutes after all the presents were open and the livingroom looked like a bomb went off, I didn't see my nephew.  He wasn't in his room playing with all new toys.  He was in the kitchen with this Wimpy Kid book!  He loves this series.

There were only so many of these editions made and each one comes with a certificate of authenticity. Love it! <3
B00080ETV8|4.0|1.<br />Jane Eyre (1983) Individual rating: 5 stars<br /><br />This BBC version of Jane Eyre starring Timothy Dalton is the best version I have seen. Compared with the Miramax 1996 version, 1997 A&E version, or 2006 Masterpiece adaptation, this 1983 adaptation is considerably better. [However, Jayston's characterization of Rochester in the 1973 adaptation is more accurate to Charlotte Bronte's intent.]<br /><br />What I liked about the BBC 1983 version is that I can picture the characters in their respective roles. For example, Timothy Dalton is everything I imagined Edward Fairfax Rochester as being - smart, sarcastic, cynical, etc (even if he is too handsome). In addition, Zelah Clarke plays Jane Eyre very well. She brings a serious tone to Jane's character. Some television editions of Jane Eyre 'tick me off' by having an older teenager girl (who has no maturity) play this important role. The acting does not convince me and ruins the film.<br /><br />Finally, this film appeals to me because it takes much of the dialogue straight from the book. Certainly, there are a few minor scenes from the book that are left out or slightly compressed. However, for the most part, this film is perfectly loyal to the novel. In fact, I probably shouldn't say, but this film is so accurate that you could probably pass a reading comprehension test on the novel \\"Jane Eyre\\" simply by watching this film one or two times and taking notes.<br /><br />I also recommend the 1973 BBC \\"Jane Eyre\\" adaptation. (In fact, I think the 1973 adaptation has the better characterization, although a slightly less-faithful plot in areas that do not much matter such as when Jane is roaming the countrside after fleeing Thornfield Hall.)<br /><br />2.<br />Middlemarch  Individual rating: 3.5 stars<br /><br />Having watched \\"Bleak House\\" (2005) and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (1996) both scripted by Andrew Davies, I was hoping this adaptation of \\"Middlemarch\\" would be excellent. I was slightly disappointed. I do not think the film is truly aweful, but I do believe it could have been more interesting. \\"Middlemarch\\" is a long and complicated novel, and I feel Davies could have done a better job with the script.<br /><br />I only viewed \\"Middlemarch\\" once a few years ago. (I purchased it as part of the George Eliot BBC collection.) Therefore, I do not remember everything I felt could have been improved. I think the biggest problem I had was Davies perspective since it creates the reality for the viewer. I felt his perspective was not quite emotional enough, even considering how melancholic certain parts of the Eliot's length novel are.<br /><br />Furthermore, at 375 minutes, I do not believe justice was done to the entire cast of characters. Some characters really lacked sufficient development.<br /><br />Personally, unless you are an Eliot afficiando, I would just wait until the BBC creates another \\"Middlemarch\\" adaptation.

B0018BB21G|3.0|I have the {Deluxe Edition} of this album, with two discs. The first disc is the original album, and the second contains 15 hard-to-find tracks. That's 6 more than are offered here. Some of these tracks - notably \\"Thinking Is The Best Way To Travel (from Top Gear)\\" with its crisp flute accents - sound more impressive than the original studio version.<br /><br />If you just wanted the re-masterd album, this is a decent product. If you are more interested in the bonus material, you should be aware that some of it is missing in this offering. That's why I don't give it five stars.

Gilmour's Magnum Opus.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|When creating a movie from a game like Silent Hill all the elements you need to make an outstanding movie are basicly given to you. If anyone involved in creation of this movie had played the games they would have understood much of a disgrace this movie is.<br /><br /> Silent Hill the game itself plays out like movie. They could of taken the game and just played it out scene by scene and would of had a spectacular movie. Silent Hill should the movie should of been a cross between Stephen King's The Mist and M.Shyamalan's The 6th sense. Two films that that leave you with that spookie feeling of wonderment but provide plenty of \\"shock\\" gore when it's time to scare you. That myfriends is what Silent Hill is like. A Town covered in fog with strange creatures and running into people that you don't know are dead or not.<br /><br /> After seeing Resident Evil and how that turned out in it's movie adaption I wasn't exactly thrilled about Silent Hill comming out on movie. I watched it and it was like pulling the wings off a butterfly. They actually managed to sample just about every other popular horror flick,throw in some elements from the game, and expect to pass it off as Silent Hill. I felt absolutely insulted by all this. Not only because I'm a Silent Hill fan, but because I'm also a die hard fan of horror movies.<br />I couldn't really get into the movie already knowing what cheap knockoff spooks they were going to try because you've seen it 1million other times in just about every horror movie ever created from 1970-to whenever this junk came out.<br /><br /> I mean I don't hate this movie, I just hate that it's named after something I love and enjoy so much. If this was just another horror flick I'd give it 2 or 3 stars for trying and move on, but this... this is supposed to be SILENT FREAKING HILL! Instead I get the Grudge/Ring/Shinning/Excorcist/Firestarter/Omen/Carrie/You name it it's here!<br /><br />A NOTE TO PRODUCERS! IF YOUR GOING TO MAKE A MOVIE OFF A GAME ATLEAST PLAY IT FIRST!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is among the most stunning books I've ever read.  The author's unique ability to play with words in such a way that together they capture and create atmosphere is amazing.  Having read numerous books about the horrible period of history that Germany in WWII was, the narrative provided by 'death' brings a totally new perspective.  The main character - a 12 year old girl is richly captured in all of her complexity and innocence, as are the events of her life.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works?  One can only hope as the reader is left wondering how the rest of her life transpired.  I highly recommend this book - prepare to be captivated by the writing first, and the story as well.
0786868724|5.0|In \\"Have a Little Faith\\", Mitch Albom, the author of such best-sellers as \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" and \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" has once again hit a home run. This true-life tale begins with a question. An elderly Rabbi named Albert Lewis asks Albom to give his eulogy. Taken aback by the question, he asks the Rabbi, who he refers to as \\"Reb\\" if he is dying. \\"Not yet,\\" he replies. In many ways, \\"Have a Little Faith\\" is about that \\"not yet.\\" It is about the journey that Albom takes to get to know this Rabbi better as well as the spiritual journey that takes place within Albom as a result. Interspersed in the story is the tale of another man of God, Pastor Henry Covington.<br /><br />Covington has taken an unlikely route to the ministry and ministers to unlikely Christians. At first, the reader will wonder how these two tales are connected. The story of an upstanding Rabbi facing his decline, and the tale of a young drug dealer seem to have little in common. Albom, always the consummate story teller, has done a fine job of interweaving them into a beautiful portrait of what it means to serve God. The reader will have to wait for those connections to make themselves clear, but the wait is definitely worth it.<br /><br />At the time when Albom is asked to write and deliver Lewis' eulogy, he hadn't really been around him in twenty-five years. Even as a child, he had attempted to run away from him. \\"He was tall, six foot one, and I felt tiny in his presence. When he looked down through his black-rimmed glasses, I was certain he could view all my sins and shortcomings. So I ran. I ran until he couldn't see me anymore.\\" As an adult, Albom had moved away both figuratively and literally. He decides he needs to get to know Lewis better in order to do him justice in this final farewell. What Albom thinks will be a few meetings turns out to be eight years of interaction. Albom deftly shares stories from long ago with lessons from the \\"Reb\\" now until the reader is granted a very moving picture of him. In one particularly insightful passage, Albom tells of the Rabbi's pain when his young daughter died. Albom asked him that unanswerable question, \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\" he honestly answered \\"No one knows.\\" Yet, this never caused the Rabbi to question his faith in God. Atheism held no appeal for him. He stated, \\"It is far more comforting to think God listened and said no, than to think that nobody's out there.\\" The Rabbi also shared his great secret of happiness with Albom. It's very simple, really - be satisfied and be grateful for what you have.<br /><br />\\"Have a Little Faith\\" is about the journey - of these two men of God who Albom rights about and about Albom's own journey. Yet, readers will find their own journey in these pages as well, for humans, regardless of their faith traditions, reach out for the God that created them.

In one particularly insightful passage, Albom tells of the Rabbi's pain when his young daughter died. Albom asked him that unanswerable question, \\"Why do bad things happen to good people?\\" he honestly answered \\"No one knows.\\" Yet, this never caused the Rabbi to question his faith in God. Atheism held no appeal for him. He stated, \\"It is far more comforting to think God listened and said no, than to think that nobody's out there.\\" The Rabbi also shared his great secret of happiness with Albom. It's very simple, really - be satisfied and be grateful for what you have.     \\"Have a Little Faith\\" is about the journey - of these two men of God who Albom rights about and about Albom's own journey.

1400079276|2.0|Had me turning the pages initially.  The characters are well developed and interesting.  The prose is rich and moving at times.      Eventually I began to wonder about why it was important to mention that someone was driving a \\"Mazda Miata\\" and a  \\"Volkswagen Golf\\" and quenching their thirst with a Pepsi (5 times in 2 pages)    Companies like Pepsi and Volkswagen pay authors to place their products into their stories. (Just like in the movies) It's disgusting.    It seems were forced to ingest more advertising with each passing moment.      In a work of fiction by a supposed principled author, I found it disappointing and distracting to the point where I didn't want to read further.
0446567337|5.0|I love this book. Not a typical ending, which is common for Sparks. But if you or a loved one is stationed in Iraq, I do not suggest reading this or seeing the movie.<br />Either way, I had a lot of emotion while reading this book. It broke my heart so many times.

B000001E18|5.0|I personally feel that Zooropa is one of U2's most under-appreciated albums.  Released in 1993, the album is an experimental mishmash of sounds.  The Edge's stamp is all over this album, as there are guitars that sound like guitars, pianos, strings, or simply noise, along with keyboard and synth sounds, some of which are provided by Brian Eno.  It's a short album, containing only ten songs, but all are gems in their own way.  Zooropa is one of those albums you can listen to over and over again and discover something new each time, especially when using headphones.  It always seems like every time I listen to it, I find some small instrumental nugget that I didn't hear before, or if I had, I'd forgotten about it.  The whole album is a keeper, but some of the highlights are the title track, \\"Lemon\\", \\"Stay(Faraway, So Close)\\", \\"Daddy's Going to Pay For Your Crashed Car\\", \\"The First Time\\", and the Johnny Cash vocalization \\"The Wanderer\\".<br /><br />Not only is the music on this album incredible, but there are some great lyrics to go along with it.  My favorite track on the album is \\"Lemon\\", which contains some incredible lines.  There's a section where The Edge and Eno sing \\"A man melts the sand, so he can see the world outside.\\"  The process and artistry of making glass is reduced to one simple line, but I think it serves as an apt summary of this album and creative endeavors in general.  Be it music, art, literature, glass, whatever, the human race creates in order to understand and become part of the larger world.  This album was U2 at the height of their creativity.  Zooropa sounded like nothing else in 1993 and there's nothing that sounds like it in the present, either.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I am a proud member of the select club that is the Porcupine Tree fan. It still amazes me how many people have never heard of this band when they are the main ones out there on the cutting edge, making by far the most interesting and intelligent music you can find these days. In this respect, they are 2nd only to what Rush has done over the years.<br /><br />The Incident is yet another outstanding album. Let me start my review by saying: Something occurred to me recently, and that is the fact that in Porcupine Tree's catalog, nothing really sounds the same. Yes, there is no doubt a stylistic signature to Porcupine Tree, but everything they do remains innovative and unique. The Incident continues in this quality. The first song that I heard was Time Flies and I was immediately drawn in by the ringing guitars, the layered musical textures and poignant lyrics. Then upon purchasing the album, it took me only a couple of listens to really get into the uniqueness of what Porcupine Tree has accomplished on The Incident. Because there aren't too many lengthy \\"songs\\" on this album, you really need to absorb the whole 55 minute concept. In this, The Incident succeeds in moving you from snapshot to snapshot, while maintaining an overall flow. Yes, there are some short songs that I would have liked to hear more of (Kneel and Disconnect and Circle of Manias come primarily to mind) and in this you miss a little of the musical exploration that is typical to Porcupine Tree. Taken as one big song however, The Incident is entirely satisfying. Musically, lyrically, atmospherically. This is a solid effort.<br /><br />And then you get the second disc with four other songs. I particularly like Black Dahlia and Bonnie the Cat.<br /><br />Anyone that has any issue with The Incident is probably dissapointed because you just can't get enough of this band.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I did both this workout along with the metabolism boost dvd this week.  I have no doubt these programs will burn calories and help you lose weight.  However, my doctor (who is a marathoner and weight lifter) practically jumped down my throat when I told her that I did these programs b/c I have a history of knee injuries.  These dvd's are for advanced exercisers.  Try to build up knee and leg strength before trying these. I injured myself after doing too many jumping jacks (yes, she actually incorporates those) and jumping squats (you have to turn 180 degrees believe it or not).  If you do not land in a stable position (and this is a big \\"if\\") you can seriously injure yourself.  Hopefully I can lose some weight over the next few months and work my way to this, but for the time being I wanted to put out a \\"Buyer Beware\\" on this dvd....it's a fat blaster....but with a very high risk of injury.  It's not worth injury if you ask me.  Back to the FIRM...great results using cardio/weight interval combinations but no risky jumping moves.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|I don't leave reviews, but this thing is pissing me off so bad I feel compelled.    The quality of voice chat and game sound is very good, as long as you stay within ~20ft of the base. If you move outside of that, at least in my case, the headset emits an extremely loud (I'd estimate 5x as loud as the loudest sound with respect to the volume setting) crackling sound. It hurts the ears...  If the engineering behind this is the cause, which is what I suspect, I would recommend not purchasing this product.

B001IMFHVG|5.0|It was said the Rubinstein loved playing before a live audience and that he played his best in front of one. This performance clearly supports the proposition. The black and white video is not too good but the visual inadequacy is soon eclipsed by the pianistic brilliance. It was obvious that he was playing his heart out and relished the adoration of the audience. An absolutely magnificent performance. You'll never tire of watching it.  As I said, the video is only adequate but the sound is quite acceptable.

0765356139|4.0|First, the non-spoiler bits.  Brandon Sanderson's writing only improves through this series, and \\"The Final Empire\\" itself was a HUGE step up from Elantris.  He does still tend to repeat himself a lot: characters often have 'tics' that they repeat often, and they often think about the same things each time you see them.  Somehow it didn't bother me as much as I thought it should have, and one of the interesting things that became even more evident in the final book was that this style kept things fresh in your mind that would become important later.  He also focuses far more on characters' thoughts than is probably generally considered to be good writing style, but again it somehow worked for me once I got used to it.    The story itself is quite a bit different than the one told in \\"The Final Empire\\".  Effectively, much of it focuses on the characters trying to consolidate what they won in the first book.  As such the feel is very different.  In one way, it's jarring, but in another it's quite refreshing to see a realistic look at how things can change in people's lives after major events.    I highly recommend that people continue the series if they finished the first book and for some reason are ambivalent about it.  I've waffled for a bit on the rating, but the fact was I wasn't as engaged with the story as I was in \\"The Final Empire\\", at least until later when things started to really pick up.  As such the highest I would rate this book would be 4 1/2 stars, and I rarely round up.          First set of spoiler information below.. applies to people who have NOT read the first book.  If you haven't, you may learn things you wish you hadn't.  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Ok, still with me?   Brandon Sanderson's \\"trick\\" of including a separate appearing story in brief italicized bits at the start of each chapter continues.  And it's done just as well as in the first book, perhaps even more so.  This bit is what turns a very good book into a borderline great one.    He also does something which rings very true compared to the real world.  A major character dies in the first book.  In most novels there's a bit of remembramce, mourning, etc, and then nothing else except in bits and pieces.  Instead, this character is remembered and talked about throughout the whole novel.  This was brilliantly done.    Finally, this book turns what appeared to be a relatively pedestrian twist at the end of the first book into something much more meaningful: in much the same way that the storyline in the Star Wars' prequels (much as I might dislike the rest of those movies) changes how you view Vader's sacrifice in \\"Return of the Jedi\\".  This is very neatly done.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Awesome film. \\"Inconvenient truth\\" film by Al Gore was for the mind. This film is for the feeling. This is the feeling, sensate, version of the same film, putting in dazzling images the data most of us are aware off by now, and, in this way, it goes much deeper. The images are so stunning, they leave you mesmerized. In fact they have a haunting quality. But the film 's intent is not to leave us in a daze, it is more to motivate us into action and wake us up from our sleep. I recommend this film wholeheartedly.
B002CPD5LC|3.0|I purchased this without even thinking about seeing it. I am such a big Quincy fan and with all the featured singers and musicians what could be bad about this DVD? Ok, first of all I LOVE me some Patti Austin. She was great, looking good after gastric bypass surgery, sounded great and really singing. Rahsaan Patterson did good on Let the Good Times Roll, Mick Hucknall rocked! Now who in the world decided to give Petula Clark One Mint Julep and Going to Chicago Blues??! Even Nana Mouskouri was not so hot on her songs as well. I was like ??. I was waiting on Ledisi to kill me but she, along with many other singers did NOT know the lyrics!! I'm a big Chaka Khan fan also but she is still reading the lyrics to Miss Celie's Blues?? Wasn't she in The Color Purple Stage Production?? She read the same lyrics on Quincy Jones LIVE in Montreaux 1996 DVD. The background singers were not the greatest either, reading words and looking at each other as if they were unsure. Stuff Like That got junky too, thought it would have been hot since Chaka was there to do those signature things too it. The band ROCKED! I mean Greg Phillinganes, Herbie Hancock, Joe Sample, Lee Ritenour, Nathan East...no complaints there they were solid. Who else rocked? Naturally 7, Patti Austin and James Moody, Freda Payne(forgot her lyrics too but fixed it with scatting and just kinda working it out)and Angelique Kidjo.   This DVD is worth having if youre a fan but it could have been better. Happy Birthday Mr. Quincy Jones you are music royalty!
0230013880|5.0|My son is almost 3 and this is currently his favorite book. He will not get in the car without it and sits quietly in his carseat staring at the pictures. This is a first because he never asked for a book in the car before. Sometimes all I'll hear from the backseat is \\"the humpback whale\\" or \\"itchy foot.\\" The rhymes are fun, the story is cute and the illustrations wonderful.

B001K61O6C|1.0|Very disappointing SACD. Uses none of the technical advantages of SACD.  Is simply a re-recording of the 1970s original master with all its typical 70s era flaws.  Could have achieved the same goals by re-recording on 8 track tape except they don't exist anymore.  Only buy this if you are interested in having a historically accurate recording, not if you are interested in great sound.  Recommend buying the cd for $4.71 which interestingly enough claims to be remastered.
9113020730|5.0|When I finished this, the third volume in the series, a few things occurred to me about Stieg Larsson's overall design. I'd like to share them with avid fans like myself, and perhaps people who may be on the fence. (For those who have not read the book, I will not discuss plot details or the ending.)<br /><br />Although all three books use an objective, detailed, journalistic prose style and a multi-viewpoint, limited third person voice, as well as share characters and have a unity of time and setting, each belongs to a separate, distinct genre. The first is a classic Raymond Chandler-type mystery in which a member of a wealthy, powerful family with a dark secret launches an investigator on a search that ultimately leads into the past. Examples of the genre include \\"The Big Sleep,\\" \\"Chinatown,\\" and novels by such writers as Jonathan Kellerman. The second book is a thriller in which a vulnerable protagonist with hidden skills flees both dangerous criminal enemies and the police. The solution to a crime is secondary to survival, and defeating a powerful villain. Examples of the genre include \\"The Fugitive,\\" \\"The Firm\\" and novels by such writers as James Patterson.<br /><br />The third book, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is something else again: a spy thriller that turns into a courtroom drama. Like me, many of you have probably read that Larsson intended to write more than a trilogy (planning ten books, and outlining as many as seven.) Here, I believe, is the best evidence of that. I think Larsson would have continued his pattern of writing each book in a different genre, but combining two genres in this third book was not part of his original plan. I personally believe that Larsson learned of his prognosis in the process of writing \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,\\" and in order to conclude the story in the time he had, used elements from the outlines of two, and I would argue three, different projected novels in this one book. I believe had Larsson lived, he would have dedicated an entire novel each to the secret agents, the trial, and the events in the brief epilogue. I also believe that those projected novels would not necessarily have appeared sequentially or in that order.<br /><br />I am grateful for the choice that Larsson made. This way we get to have his ending, written by him, and not a hired hand. We get his ultimate determination as to the fate of all his characters. Also, I prefer to have the authentic if somewhat compressed, and possibly somewhat embryonic three-novels-in-one, rather than someone else's speculative expansion.<br /><br />Another observation I would like to make considers the meaning of the title of the entire sequence: \\"The Millenium Trilogy.\\" It is only with this third novel that I came to believe that it's Larsson's own, rather than the publisher's. Only now does the title to me makes sense. I believe it refers to a generational change. In all three books, the characters belong to three generations: the old guard of major industrialists, government agents and criminals, the middle generation of Kalle, police detectives, journalists, entrepreneurs, academics, psychiatrists, rapists and spies, and the youth of variously neglected or abused multinational computer hackers, represented by Lisbeth and her circle. As the overarching narrative of all three books evolves, each member of the middle generation (which in real life also includes Larsson) is forced to choose sides between the old guard and the youth, and wage battle. With this final book, which could have been the seventh or the tenth, Larsson finally reveals his grand design, and proves that the conflict represents a millenial shift.have dedicated an entire novel each to the secret agents, the trial, and the events in the brief epilogue.

0071359168|5.0|\\"The best opera yet written!\\" declares Emperor Joseph II, after enjoying Antonio Salieri's opera \\"Axur\\" in the magnificent 1984 film, \\"Amadeus.\\"<br /><br />Is this book the best marketing book yet written? Perhaps. What makes it so great is that it practices what it preaches. Unlike recent portly marketing books that spend hundreds of pages covering a myriad of topics, trying to be everything to everybody and winding up being nothing to nobody, this slim classic maintains its laser focus on what positioning is all about. It is simply the process of positioning the product in the mind of the prospect. Rather than trying to get consumers to buy by yelling at people with frequent, complicated messages, tap into the associations that the prospect already has using a targeted, simplified message. As Ries and Trout state, \\"In communications, as in architecture, less is more.\\"<br /><br />Over the weekend, I walked down the hair product aisle at my local Safeway supermarket. I was besieged by the glut of \\"me-too\\" shampoos, conditioners, creme rinses, and other concoctions, all with nearly identical shapes and sizes, and all screaming \\"New and Improved!\\" The experience reminded me of Ries and Trout's chapter entitled, \\"The Line Extension Trap.\\" When did the choices of Normal, Dry, and Oily explode into this multitude of clones, all demanding we believe their exaggerated claims? I can only imagine how marketing departments must have shouted \\"Heretic!\\" at the authors' advocating that too many line extensions are just that--too many.<br /><br />To answer some of the book's critics, alleging that the book does not contain enough \\"how-to\\" advice, I submit that \\"Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind\\" be viewed not as a step-by-step guide, but rather as a manifesto. A manifesto that rallies marketers to action. A manifesto that states, now just as back when it was written, that there has got to be a better way. Instead of barraging consumers with irrelevant, unengaging ads, trigger the associations already in people's minds through the positioning process. Twice the results in half the time.<br /><br />In a world where marketers are asked to do more with less, it makes sense to consider the advice of this book.<br /><br />The best marketing book yet written? I think even Mozart would have acknowledged its greatness.dy in people's minds through the positioning process. Twice the results in half the time.

0553381687|4.0|This novel has excellent characters and an unpredictable, satisfying plot.  The prose and descriptions are just the right length, and the style feels like a modern update to classic storytelling (not as dry as Tolkien).<br /><br />My main criticism is that the flow of the novel feels uneven.  There is a revelation regarding the main mystery of the story quite a bit far from the ending, and the momentum for the last few hundred pages feels hectic.  The quiet bits of character moments from the first half of the novel give way to a relentless avalanche of events all the way through to the end.  However, the strength of the characters and the clever set up for the rest of the series leaves the reader wanting more.
B000ZELISO|4.0|This is a good movie, but as everyone else has mentioned, has a lot of very important parts of the story missing.  If you haven't read the book or it's been a long time since you have read the book, I'm certain you will enjoy this movie a lot.      The quality on the Blu Ray is very good, there is a big difference between this movie and some of the previous films.  The first film was very grainy and had some color issues.  The extras in this movie are good but there could be some more exclusives.  I recommend this movie especially at this price.
0440238153|5.0|Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy is easily one of my all time favorite fantasy series. This is despite recognition that it resorts to some pretty weak storytelling techniques at way too many places (more of that later). But the books' weaknesses are overwhelmed by wonderfully sketched characters, almost endless imagination in creating worlds that astound and delight, and a wonderful and engrossing story. Pullman's story is also amazingly unique and refreshing, completely unlike any other fantasy stories of recent decades.<br /><br />C. S. Lewis wrote that one of the joys of reading is that it pulls you into worlds of which you previously knew nothing. That is certainly the case here. My complaint with most fantasy novels is that they provide endless repackagings of Middle Earth-like worlds. At this point I'm suffering from pretty serious Middle Earth imitator fatigue, which is one reason that I've read less and less sword and sorcerer kinds of fantasy as the years have gone by. But the multiple worlds explored in Pullman's trilogy are both unique and delightful, and fantastically refreshing (yes, pun intended) after so much dreck out there.<br /><br />Many of my fellow Christians detest these books because of their explicitly anti-Christian bent. I mean, seriously. People are afraid that a fantasy novel trilogy is going to threaten their faith? Moreover, I honestly believe that both the cosmopolitan (if Old School and decidedly orthodox) C. S. Lewis and the ultra reactionary pre-Vatican II Catholic J. R. R. Tolkien (who thankfully kept his reactionary religious beliefs out of his fantasy fiction) would both have loved this series of novels. Yeah, Pullman hates Christianity. So what? I found his antireligious stance trite and Pullman's depiction of God really had nothing to do with my God.<br /><br />I can't express how much I love these books despite some really serious flaws. I refer to the Dei ex machine. Yep, the plural. Over and over and over Lyra and/or Will or other characters are saved by the miraculous intervention of one or another hero. The degree of coincidence is nothing short of incredulous. Many writers utilize coincidence, but Pullman is almost without shame in going to that well over and over. So repeatedly characters get in dire circumstances and someone shows up at the most crucial moment to rescue them.<br /><br />The only other complaint that I have with the book is the resolution of the prophecies about Lyra. She is part the new Eve and part Christ figure. The latter role is played out in her emptying hell. In some Christian mythology (it is not orthodox theology since it is based on tradition rather than Scripture) Jesus after his death storms the gates of hell. Lyra performs that function before she goes on to become the new Eve. I enjoyed the freeing of hell part of the book, but it isn't clear precisely how the new Eve part fulfilled in any significant way acts that fulfilled the great prophecies made of her.<br /><br />But the strengths of the book dwarf the book's undeniable weaknesses. It is, in fact, a testimony to the trilogy's strong points that you can forgive them because there is so much in the book to love and enjoy. Frankly, this is one of my all time favorite fantasy series, right up there with LORD OF THE RINGS, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, and the Harry Potter books.<br /> Comment   Permalinkracters are saved by the miraculous intervention of one or another hero.

B001HR5AIC|5.0|Yes it is...both albums in 2CD UK deluxe editions...with no tracks missing (yep, \\"Addicted\\" is there in all it's glory)...together in a nice, stylish, compact booklike 4CD box, not unlike the Faces and Paul Weller singles boxes.  I came upon this set by accident, as I had the 2007 2CD UK deluxe of \\"Back To Black\\", in the nice, sturdy, hard black slipcase...amazed that it never got reissued in the US as it was a massive hit in wake of her 2008 Grammy win...and I knew there was a similarly packaged white UK 2CD reissue of \\"Frank\\"...the US version was missing \\"Help Yourself\\", and I found this out after-the-fact, when I bought the US deluxe and sold my original UK CD of \\"Frank\\"...I was angry!!!  Soooo I went-a-looking for this 2CD UK \\"Frank\\" and, wahey, I came upon this deluxe, beautiful 4CD bookbox of both albums instead!!!  And no, I did not come upon that \\"Frank\\"...it might be quite limited...but I didn't care, and I was happy as I came upon this much-better alternative!!!<br /><br />I got it in the mail today, new and sealed, and it was perfect...PERFECT!!!  And it had a nice little surprise as well...the US 2CD edition of \\"Frank\\" had 17 tracks on the bonus disc...I thought it was the same on the UK edition...nope...the box has 18, EIGHTEEN!!!  The other extra track is track 2, a demo of \\"You Send Me Flying\\", so in reality, the US deluxe is missing TWO tracks...\\"Help Yourself\\" & the \\"You Send Me Flying\\" demo, so I was even more thrilled!!  The artwork is great with the font colour-schemes of white & yellow against a black & white background, all photos, some bigger than on the original CDs and cover 2 pages in the booklet.  It has full lyrics, and more spread-out over 38 pages, instead of a tiny CD booklet...Amy's music is worth this kind of deluxe treatment, it really does.  And it has full language, with none of this \\"F*** Me Pumps\\", nothing is edited, which serves Amy well.  Another surprise...the cover photo...do you know who took it??  Bryan Adams...BRYAN ADAMS!!!  Apparently, both are friends and are both embassadors for the \\"hear The World Campaign\\", which is really cool and admirable.<br /><br />Just one quibble though...the liner notes in the \\"Frank\\" reissue are intact in this bookboxset...and I was hoping there would be liner notes or an essay on the \\"Back To Black\\" album...nope...just full lyrics, lots of photos, and full album credits...too bad, but at least nothing is taken away...I also wish, for completion-sake, the version of \\"Valerie\\" from Mark Ronson's \\"Version\\" was included, and maybe the US rap version of \\"You Know I'm No Good\\", both tacked on at the end, but no biggie...also the track order on Disc 4, the \\"Back To Black\\" B-sides, is slightly different, but nothing is removed.<br /><br />Amy's great and admirable, despite her troubles with drugs and the law...she's also quite charming, having met her, her holding out her hand and greeting me in her accent, \\"Helllow, Oim Imay\\", and a wink & smile...and I'm really looking forward to her next album...songs are written already like \\"Gutter\\" and \\"Your Soul's Been Sold\\"...it'll be great and worth the wait...<br /><br />Amy will always have my support and this bookbox is worth every penny I paid indeed!!arently, both are friends and are both embassadors for the \\"hear The World Campaign\\", which is really cool and admirable.

B002QW7AJY|4.0|What seemed in previews to be \\"Event Horizon redux\\" (which is ironic considering that Event Horizon director Paul W.S. Anderson is a producer here), Pandorum proves to be just about anything but.  Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid play crew members on a ship that is the last hope for the survival of humanity, and wake up with no memory of their identities or their mission.  As the film goes on, both men grow to discover other survivors, as well as the fact that they are definitely not alone on the ship.  I really don't want to say any more for fear of spoiling the surprises that lie within Pandorum, but it is safe to say that the film delivers the goods in terms of frights, suspense, gore, and overall mind messing.  Though there are a number of plot holes to find, director Christian Alvart, who helmed the internationally acclaimed Antibodies, provides so much visual flair and grimy creepiness that it just ends up being hard to look away from the finished product and find anything wrong with it.  It helps that Quaid and especially Foster are put to excellent use here as well, with Foster proving once again that he has become one of the most formidable, and underrated, actors around today.  All in all, no matter how derivative Pandorum may look to you at first glance, give it a shot.  You will indeed be glad that you did.

1594488843|5.0|Drive is one of those books that is very good at explaining what does and doesn't motivate a person to want to accomplish a task.  As the books shows, internal motivation is the holy grail in management.  If an employee does something because they want to - efficiency and productivity is so much higher.  Money has long thought to be a great motivator, though as Drive points out money can be a motivator but it must be used properly.  Bonuses and rewards also must be timed correctly and delivered in a way that the person feels a personal connection.    The author uses terminology that is currently with the mindset of today's business milieu.  Where motivation would have been described in mechanical terms during the industrial revolution Drive is written as if management was a computer software.    Overall I thought it was well-written and insightful.    Spoiler Alert: Money is correlated to lower levels of creativity.
B002SQ364Q|4.0|Imagine yourself standing on a hill with Michael Lange and Max Yasgur (and you are actually looking at the site where the Festival was held) and witnessing the deal being made, Ang Lee creates this beautifully, and Eugene Levy is great as Max Yasgur.    Imagine yourself living in this small quiet community and one weekend in August, 500,000 Hippies from America flow through your town and piss off every Redneck aroud .... your there!    Imagine climbing into a Van with two strangers and taking LSD for the first time, then going home to your Mother and Father's house in the morning, feeling like the world was passing you by.    Imagine standing in the abandoned field after the Festival has ended, and you are looking at the stage that presented the bands (this has to be one of the best Sets I've ever seen in a movie)     This movie is about the small community of Bethel, New York and the young man who helped bring The Woodstock Festival there in the summer of 69'. If your a fan of the movie Woodstock and the soundtrack album, you will most likely enjoy this movie.
B000058983|4.0|This lp had no hit singles and if your unfamiliar with it, it is a strange sounding album at first listen. But after some repeated listens I found myself liking it more and more. It is very hard to catorigize. Not quite rock, not quite soul, not folk, yet it has all these elements within it. Although you can tell this lp was recorded in the late 60s, it has a timeless quality to it that makes it very revelent today. I would re3commend this album to anyone. My only advice would be to make sure you listen to it quite a few times. It has a strange hypnotic quality that grabs after repeated spins
1563890119|4.0|As a Gaiman fan, I've read Coraline and Stardust as well as Neverwhere and I would have to say that Preludes and Nocturnes was not as good as some of his other work.  Admittedly, it's a graphic novel, a totally different genre and one that I am not an expert on.  On the whole though, I thought this book was good.  Good enough for me to want to buy the next one.  A warning though, having read Watchmen and half of From Hell, I was initially pleased that this book was nowhere near as disturbingly graphic as those two books, that is until I got to the chapter entitled \\"24 hours\\".  It made me want to throw up it was so disturbing.
0385504225|2.0|I liked [[ASIN:B002CF0GP0 Angels & Demons]], and I thought[[ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]] was a fantastic read...fun, great twists, cool story, nice little historical mystery deal. Great. Fast-paced with lots of cliff-hangers, which I totally dig. Lost Symbol has plenty of cliff-hangers, but this time the pay-off just isn't there. The bad guy kinda sucks, he's weird and that's good, but his big motivation is telegraphed way early on so his big reveal was kinda spoiled. Also, the shocking revelation that would overturn the entire country? Really? That's all you could come up with? Bleh. Then the BIG final mystery...I really felt cheated. That's it?! That's all there is? Wow, what an amazing let down. And the epilogue was just a waste of 30 pages. Everything about the book prior to that was good. But the ending was so deflating and uninteresting that it demolished everything that came before it. What a shame...I still like Dan Brown and Robert Langdon, but I hope they didn't just jump the shark on this one. Solving the codes and stuff on the cover was more fun than reading the ending of this book. Maybe if you only read the first 350 pages and let the ending be a mystery...that might be the best way to enjoy this one. One of the worst endings to a fun book that I have read in a long time.
B002P5XXR0|2.0|Just returned from seeing the movie. What surprised me immediately was how bland and \\"familiar\\" the soundtrack was, supposedly  giving an aural counterpart to the alien luminiscent forests of Pandora, but failing blatanty to do so. We're not in Kansas anymore, weren't we?. Why , I wonder, such a lot of work, technology, time and money went into the visual aspect of this movie, and none into the sonic fabric? (even though Mr. Horner's bill must have been high)  You got the usual string-perc-lame synthesizer bunch. And when the natives sing, oh boy, they're singing \\"sacred\\" chants, which surely do not sound like this Deep forest/Enigma pastiche which verges on the ridiculous. Has no one in production made some cultural research? Traditions from all around the world abound in profound and moving examples of what the power of an inspired community  chanting can be.   Anyway, the music sounded like a soundtrack-by-numbers (chase moment/romantic moment/battle moment, etc.), never enhancing the otherworldly quality of Pandora, but reverting it to the ordinary instead. A letdown.   (As for the visual inspiration, couldn't find a mention anywhere thanking Roger Dean. Did anyone?)  -Please excuse any mistakes as english is a foreign language for me-

B001QOGYFO|4.0|For U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko, things are about to get even more dangerous.

The whole idea of being on Antarctica was fascinating. I think this movie will give you the kind of intelligent thriller fans of this genre of movies enjoy.

B002KREVE2|4.0|1970's Isle of Wight Festival was one of the landmark events in popular music history, comparable to the prior year's Woodstock. 600,000 people heard some of the era's most popular and significant artists over five days. There were multiple great performances, but at least as important culturally and historically is what the crowd itself did - in a word, explode. About three times as many people showed up as expected, many without paying. A wall was put up to keep out the latter, and the crowd rebelled. The wall was knocked down, and many things were set on fire - including the very stage during one of Jimi Hendrix's most famous performances, as well as several instruments. Some of the less incendiary performers, such as Kris Kristofferson, were pelted and/or booed offstage. Fed up and perhaps scared, director Murray Lerner, there to film the festival, packed up before Cohen's performance.    Such was the atmosphere when Leonard Cohen was due to play after Hendrix - a near-impossible act to follow in any case, needless to say. Pushing his already seemingly bad luck, Cohen insisted on a piano and organ when told they had been burned and pushed offstage, taking a nap in the meantime. He was eventually woken up and casually took his time getting dressed - putting clothes over his pajamas - and tuning. Then, with complete calm and something like mastery, he took the stage. Even then he did not launch into his long-awaited - his current album was #2 in the UK - and long-delayed performance but strolled gingerly to the microphone and gave a long allegory about attending the circus as a child. Finally, after an impromptu little song about the moment, he slowly lead into his then-popular, now-classic \\"Bird on a Wire\\" - and the rest was indeed history.    Cohen gave an excellent, hour-plus performance that is one of his most significant. By rights it should have been released at the time or in intervening decades, as have live albums by several other artists at the event. Itmay have been held back because Cohen had an ongoing studio album - Songs of Love and Hate -, three songs from which appear here, and/or because he had a live album a few years later. The recent Cohen revival - which sees him more popular than ever in many places, including America - finally and thankfully ensured the release fans have been wanting for almost forty years. Perhaps to make up for lost time, and benefitting Cohen's new status, it was put out in a deluxe CD/DVD edition with informative liner notes and a generous set of photographs. A few people may have preferred separate CD and DVD editions, as with Cohen's Live in London from earlier in 2009, but most fans would have bought both and will appreciate the convenience - especially as the package costs little more than either would have alone. It is also nice compensation for what might otherwise seem inadequate:  the concert is relatively short; the DVD lacks several songs; and sound/picture quality, while remarkable considering the equipment and the age of the tapes, are of course not up to current standards.    First I will review the CD, which has Cohen's whole show. Simply put, it is a fine performance that fans, especially of Cohen's early work, will love and appreciate. Those close to Cohen were worried that he would be heckled or even driven offstage as prior low-key performers had been, especially as he was in no hurry, but he remained calm and gave a mesmerizing performance. Against all odds, the crowd was supremely respectful, hanging onto every proverbial word - a true testament to the performance and perhaps to Cohen's droll, unhurried demeanor. He is calm, confident, and collected, calming the frenzied crowd into a near-trancelike state. Cohen played most of the best songs from his first two albums, including \\"Suzanne,\\" and three as yet unreleased:  \\"Diamonds in the Mine,\\" \\"Sing Another Song, Boys,\\" and \\"Famous Blue Raincoat.\\" These were saved until near the end and doubtless greatly appreciated. Probably everyone will miss a favorite or two, but the selection is hard to fault. Anyone who likes Cohen's early live album Live Songs will surely like this significantly more, as selection is notably superior and performances more consistent. A breathtakingly intimate \\"One of Us Cannot Be Wrong\\" is the highlight for me, but others may have different preferences; there is really no weak performance.    A significant bonus is that, as is his wont, Cohen also recites several poems. His choices are short and humorous, and the crowd responds approvingly. Perhaps even more interesting, and certainly more valuable in being unique to the show, is Cohen's frequent trademark onstage banter. He has an unusual voice and way of speaking for a popular music performer; one can tell he was used to reciting poetry, which truly makes him stand out from the mindless shouting and crowd enticing of most festivals. He also has a generous, if offbeat, sense of humor. All this comes out in several stories and song introductions; the latter sometimes have interesting information but are also valuable in themselves as samples of Cohen's impromptu speech. Some of what he says may have been rehearsed, but it is delightful to hear talk specifically for this crowd. He makes several insightful comments showing he was both part of and well outside the dying hippie movement, including several subtle digs at its superficiality, and the crowd reacts with a curious mix of appreciation and ambivalent silence. Perhaps most memorably, Cohen throws in \\"I know there are a lot of Maoists and atheists out there, but...\\" during the repeated \\"You've won me, my lord\\" at the end of \\"Lady Midnight.\\" Pushing such a hostile crowd so hard was a considerable risk, and we must admire the pure chutzpah. Cohen was apparently heckled only once, responding, \\"Are you calling me a fascist pig again?\\" The ensuing laughter deflated the potentially fatal situation, leaving him undisputed master of the crowd. Neophytesmay be puzzled and/or turned off by Cohen's banter, but it will delight fans.    I have no real complaints about the performance, but a few quibbles that are essentially matters of taste will affect various listeners differently. For example, some nice lyric changes aside, the performances, in marked contrast to Cohen's latter-day approach, are generally quite similar to studio versions. This means arrangements are very minimalist - shockingly so for those used to Cohen's more expansive later renditions. Those not fully entranced by the words and/or Cohen himself may thus think the concert begins to get somewhat monotonous. However, this is true of his first four studio albums as well as his first live record; anyone who likes those will have no problem. Even so, one cannot help wondering why Cohen bothered having a band, especially such a large and prestigious one. Besides additional guitar, it features banjo, fiddle, electric bass, and other instruments, though notably no percussion. Hand-picked by legendary producer Bob Johnston - who appears on piano, organ, harmonica, and guitar against his better judgment but at Cohen's insistence -, it consists mainly of the day's best country session musicians. These players - including a pre-fame Charlie Daniels, a strange Cohen companion in many ways - were highly skilled and in great demand. Cohen was quite lucky to get them, and it seems a shame not to use them more. All songs are dominated by Cohen's acoustic guitar; several feature only it or very little else. When others do chime in it is usually only a musician or two at a time - ironically mostly Johnston, who contributes several fine organ fills and some other nice bits. The DVD shows that the band looks bored much of the time, as one might expect; they after all basically just watch Cohen like everyone else much of the time. They even seem occasionally restless, especially Daniels. Perhaps Cohen simply did not mesh well with them, despite the notes' claims. In striking contrast to his current tour, he does not seem to have much rapport with them, issuing commands gruffly and ignoring Daniels when he smilingly gets up and tries to play fiddle at Cohen's mic. As one might expect, the band has a very country sound when it does kick in; this works surprisingly well with Cohen's music and will be well appreciated by those who, like him, love country music. The band is quite good in these rare moments, making it easy to wish it had been used more. These are not really big issues musically; the minimalism keeps the focus on the words, where it should always be in Cohen, but he does seem waste some fine talent.     Also, though Cohen's signature emotion is ever-present and we can have no doubt that he pours his proverbial heart into each song as few singers can, his voice is more than usually off-key and seems to grow tired at times. He has of course never been a technical singer, which unfortunately scares many away from his great work immediately, but it is more than normally apparent here. The performance will certainly not will new converts, but this should be a non-issue for fans.    As for the DVD, it is of course great that we actually see Cohen perform, which is always interesting. However, unlike seemingly everyone else, I have some problems with the film as a film, though for admittedly subjective reasons. I personally hate ostensible concert films that intersperse documentary footage with performance. It is not that I fail to appreciate such footage; I indeed like it significantly, but it ruins the flow of the music for me. This film has relatively little of this but still does it occasionally. There is also not enough documentary footage; it would have been nice to have a lot more, as the concert is relatively short. There are short clips of recent interviews with Joan Baez, Judy Collins, and Kristofferson, but they fail to say anything that is not already common knowledge or in the booklet. The absence of Cohen himselfis also painfully felt; his long interview in the recent documentary I'm Your Man would seem to suggest he is not inaccessible, though he is certainly busy these days. As for the actual festival, the only footage is a short bit at the front of attendees talking about Cohen and a few very short crowd segments dispersed throughout the performance. The only interesting bit is Baez addressing the unruly crowd situation. Surely more footage could have been found. An entire documentary of the festival was made by the same director, and it would have been worth using some of it here if nothing new could have been unearthed. Those who have seen it might not care for the overlap, but a self-contained Cohen film would have been convenient. As always, I would have preferred to have all non-musical footage either before or after the performance or as extras.    Another problem is lack of camera angles; nearly the whole performance is a close-up of Cohen's face. This is indeed where the camera should be most of the time, but such ubiquity becomes monotonous. Close-ups of the band when it is playing would have been appropriate, and there should certainly be more crowd shots. This may have been unavoidable to a large extent. As Lerner decided to stay at a late moment, two of his three cameras were already put away. However, this is not really an excuse; one could easily say he should not have packed up, even if it is hard to blame him, and there should have been enough time in the long gap between the Hendrix and Cohen sets to get the cameras ready. Besides, and more fundamentally, he could have gotten more variety even with one camera. For example, he could have at least backed away from Cohen slightly so we could see his guitar; this is done a few times but not nearly enough. Lack of crowd shots is more understandable; it was dark, and Cohen himself frequently mentions that he cannot see the people, which surely made it all but impossible to get good shots.    More importantly,several songs are missing, as is some of the banter and all the poems. This is inexcusable if left out on purpose, as these segments are at least as good as those used and give some wished-for variety since \\"Diamonds,\\" at least, features the band fairly heavily. It may be that these parts were never filmed or that the footage has been lost, though a few songs are heard or shown in fragments in the introduction. This is a significant defect, but the others are relatively minor, and all Cohen fans should enjoy the film; indeed, all seem to enjoy it rather more than me.    All told, this is a must for Cohen fans, especially those who particularly like his early work. Fans of later material may be somewhat underwhelmed, but this is a worthy and important performance from his early period and worth seeing just for its insight into this stage of his career and for historical value. No fan should be without it.

Don't just expect for all those horrible things to happen just for the sake of being shocked. Which you will be anyways, but it's relevant and you will understand why towards the end.<br /><br />While the movie played i didn't know what to expect next. It did make me sick, scared and it even made me cry a bit seeing what those horrible people did. They had no sympathy, they were souless, they wanted truth and would torture people just for it. At the end i got it all now. It hit me at the end, i felt great impact with all sorts of emotions and for some strange reason it made me feel good after taking it all in.<br /><br />I'm still amazed from it, even after hours of watching it and if a movie makes you feel like that then it cannot be dismissed as anything less. A brilliant film that i am now proud to say it's my favorite of the horror genre!! Many people will never understand why, but those of you out there who do, you know the power of films.<br /><br />I recommend Martyrs for people that are looking for a meaning, a story, instead of just plain entertainment out of girls being tortured, but if thats your thing then hey who am i to stop you? Also for people that have strong stomachs, and are horrorfanatics such as myself.<br /><br />5 stars for everything!

Haters please don't comment on subjects you have no knowledge of.
B0002CHIJW|1.0|thi s, of course, is one of the worst movies of all time...my favorite part is that the chick is naked through almost the entire movie, which ultimately lowers wardrobe costs so more money could be spent ....on....what?...the script?...nah, no script...between scene changes new dialogue was written on the back of candy wrappers and distributed to the 'cast'....after a while, a way was found to save even MORE money--just have the \\"actors\\" make up the dialogue as they went along...and the fact that it was obviously shot using just one camera lets us get away from all those annoying multi-angle shots that normally saturate a real movie...if you are ultimately looking for a \\"movie\\" without absolutely NO redeeming social value, THIS IS IT!!!...btw, is there a rating LESS than 1 star??...just asking...
2839905809|5.0|I won't go into a deep review because the above reviews have done a great job describing this book; I'll just say that as one of the first 5000 readers this book has the potential to change the way business is looked it. It's a phenomenal collection of the best ideas of the topic weaved together in an incredible innovative way that allows readers to learn and apply while improving their knowledge of business operations and processes. The most incredible thing is how well the business model generation canvas (which you'll learn about in pages 1-80) creates a flow of ideas unlike any other way of generation a model. Enjoy and learn!
B002UD56I6|5.0|Tuve la oportunidad de ver la pelicula en el cine, y es grandioso.  Se puede ver a un Michael sencillo y amoroso y despliega su enorme talento en los ensayos.  Se puede ver el Michael exigente en su trabajo y perfeccionista.  Que pena que tan siquiera no dio ni el primer concierto. Este concierto iba a ser el mas grande y mejor en la historia de la musica.  Lo recomiendo a todos.
B001SC9G5O|4.0|An interesting book on a few topics of statistics and how they apply to the markets and life.  Basically it talks about how people perceive events vs what's actually occurring.  One example is survivorship bias in evaluating successful fund managers.
2839905809|5.0|Business Model Generation is a highly visual book with text down to the point and - with a great message: Innovative business models for the 21th century can be designed in a simple but comprehensive way, using the Business Model Canvas.    The Business Model Canvas is the basic tool which helps innovators and entrepreneurial teams in designing game-changing business models, comparing them with innovation leaders and implementing those.

0385737947|4.0|The story that was thought up for this book is very intriguing.  Between the maze, the Gladers, the Grievers, and the Beetleblades there are a lot of fascinating things to learn about in this book.  With a pretty cool twist for an ending, I think this book was definitely worth reading.  The only complaint I have is that the characters never swear, even when they are faced with life and death situations.  I understand that this may be a weird complaint but the life threatening situations seemed a little childish when a character would say 'Oh shuck' or something of the sort instead of doing what we all do when we find outselves in serious trouble and actually swear.  Aside from this pathetic and random complaint, I am very impressed with the book.  I did not know this was only book 1 of a series though, so if you are in the middle of a series now and looking for a one book break, just be aware that it will also be a series.
0451228731|3.0|The first third, or possibly first half, of this book is a great piece of near-future extrapolation of the sort that Michael Crichton was once justly famous for, back before he stopped writing novels and started writing nothing but glorified screenplays.  Suarez has taken a deep knowledge of the internet and computers, coupled with (supposedly) personal experience in online gaming, and added dashes of the latest, cutting-edge developments in robotics, acoustics and other technologies in order to create a fascinating scenario.  An internet gaming icon unleashes a massively parallel bot infestation onto the internet after his death, one with serious real-world consequences (murders, economic mayhem, etc.)  This portion of the novel is riveting in the way that trashy, page-turning novels of this sort can be at their best, and it is here that the book lives up to the hype that surrounds it, which touts it as a \\"scary\\" vision of a future that may already be upon us.    It's a slightly different sort of book in its latter half.  Here, much of the action depends less upon the machinations of an internet genius and more upon the near-omnipotence of the logic tree the man has created, one that is less near-future extrapolation and more like pure fantasy.  It's very much like Isaac Asimov's old Foundation series -- Suarez's \\"villain\\" (and, as the novel progresses, it becomes less and less clear that Suarez even views him as a villain) resembles no one so much as Hari Seldon, somehow able not only to manipulate everyone's computers and their connections, but also to perfectly anticipate and manipulate the activities of thousands upon thousands of human beings.  It was here that my suspension of disbelief faltered; the book is still the canonical \\"rip-roaring read\\", but it no longer serves as a warning of a coming technocalypse with relevance to our daily lives.    I have not read the sequel, but it is clear as this book ends that Suarez has much bigger fish to fry than internet daemons and surveillance cameras.  In this novel, he takes a first halting step or two toward a full-scale re-imagination of society.  This is potentially interesting, but also guaranteed not to date well -- the literary landscape is littered with the now-unreadable detritus of former futurist visions.  In the meantime, though, Suarez knows how to earn his writer's paycheck, since he has padded his vision with liberal doses of hellacious \\"razorback\\" motorcycles, menacing robotic BMWs, assembled-on-the-spot electronic guns (a terrorist's fondest fantasy spelled out in a spammer massacre that even I found myself rooting for), and other tricked-out action sequences done well enough that I can practically see the movie right now.  A good read, and a useful entry-level primer on some technology you should know about, but taken one step too far.
B00005JKC3|4.0|Eric Bana in The Hulk was pretty good, Of course the cgi and some details were cheesy, I think it was a Good Hulk movie, of course compared to Edward Norton in The Newer Hulk. See this and the Newer Hulk. I prefer the Newer Hulk Movie.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I compared the Kindle version with the hard copy book.  The most noticeable difference is that the bullseye and arrow illustration that marks the beginning of each chapter is not in the Kindle version.  It does not deter from the story, but I wish the Kindle version looks the same as the hard copy. In both versions, I found 3 or 4 grammatical errors, which was annoying. Also, I don't think this book is appropriate for anyone younger than middle school age due to many violent and kissy-kissing scenes. High-schoolers and above will enjoy this thrilling book. I can't wait for the Catching Fire Kindle version!
B001DHXT20|5.0|Incredible Hulk 2008 is an improvement of the silly cgi Hulk Of 2003, Which I also liked somewhat. Edward Norton is the Hulk in this one, and you got Tim Roth. Excellent choice. Hulk Fans should watch this movie instead, if not rent both.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|I simply cannot believe I wasted my time reading this book let alone the entire series. By far the most disapointing book I have read. It was extremely predictable, and annoyed the hell out of me. Edward is a sap, Bella is nothing more than a pathetic, whiney life form, and Jacob is a self absorbed pain in the ass. The entire series sucked.
B000J10EQU|3.0|I am not A Super Man fan, but I thought the movie was good, except Kevin Spacey who I can't stand due to his political stance. So it was Appropriate for him to be the Villain in my opinion.Overall though the movie is enjoyable to watch. I give it 3-4 1/2 stars.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|This movie is a pretty solid piece of work, overall.    Problems with the script:  1. The movie never explains how a clearly superior race of beings \\"stalled out\\" hovering over the Earth and almost starved themselves to death, luckily this is not important to the plot.  2. More importantly, the fact that the alien visitors clearly understand their resulting mistreatment on this planet and do nothing to change it even though they are in possession of weapon technology far superior than ours.    Other than the 2 items mentioned above, it's actually pretty good.  The special effects are mind-blowing, the viewer literally can't tell the difference between a real actor and a CG alien standing right next to each other.  A+ on this one!  I found myself hating the main character which proves to me that he really sold the part.    Worth owning, get a copy today.
B001C08RHA|5.0|IRON MAN, I saw it when it first came out, it's a Very Good movie, Robert Downey Jr Nailed it on the head in the role, I don't like that Cheadle replaced his friend in the upcoming Iron man Movie. I figure you don't mess with a good thing. It's funny,fun and lots of Action and seems true to the comic book from my point of view. Hope the next installment is as good as this.
0143038419|5.0|It appears this is a 'love it or hate it' type of book, according to the other customer reviews. My copy is very tattered, from dragging it everywhere, reading it. I absolutely enjoyed reading about Elizabeth Gilberts journey of self awareness.    I love how beautiful her writing is, and I enjoyed reading about a small slice of her life. It made me want to get out and do some traveling myself. It is so easy to get into a unhappy rut in life, and decide its easier to stay where you are than to try and change.     I would like to read her newest book that recently came out. (Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage).It seems to pick up where this book left off, so it would be nice to find out \\"what happened next\\"...
3442217784|3.0|Although the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad distinguishes assets from liabilities, I found it a bit difficult to figure out how somebody with only money enough to survive can acquire assets.   He says a house is a liability, then suggests you go out and purchases real estate.   And if your house is a liability, as he claims, what is an apartment you are living in which belongs to your landlord?      I suppose the idea is that you should invest -- but stock market investment proved to be a good way to go broke in recent years.   And bank savings lose value every day as inflation eats the dollar.   It's nice if you have a crystal ball.   Maybe careful study will teach us which way to jump, but it's quite likely that many of the people who took the risks that Kiyosaki so recommends wound up bankrupt and answering phones at a call center or working in car-washes.    Sure, Ray Kroc made a bundle by taking risks.  But for every Ray Kroc there are ten thousand guys who took similar risks and ended up broke.     Maybe what we need is a better definition of wealth.   It is true that bank statements and brokerage statements document wealth, but in an inflationary economy and an economy where the stock market is tanking, are the dollars represented in these accounts actually assets?      Another thing I found off-putting is the author's disdain for the wisdom of his biological father, who apparently has a fairly good life despite lack of a big brokerage/real estate account.  Not only is this disrespectful, it ignores the fact that not all wealth is measured in dollar amounts.   Seriously: Lois McMaster Bujold says:  \\"All wealth is ultimately biological.\\"   If you defer or avoid having children, for example, you may have more dollars in the bank, but are you actually better off?   If you spend 20 hours a day tracking your various businesses, and end with a heart condition from lack of sleep, are you really wealthy?   Those hospital bills can really cut into your bank balance!Kiyosaki also has a deeply ingrained reactionary streak.   I suspect had he lived in Victorian days, he might have argued that three-year-old starving orphans had made some earlier mistake, possibly at age two, that caused their penury.    There is wisdom here; I might even suggest my financially naive son read this book.  But I'd also want to discuss it with him critically.   A paid-off home IS an asset, even though you have to pay taxes and upkeep, because you can't live in hotel rooms and ditches.    And a going-nowhere business is a liability.       And family is an asset.  Even Poor Dad, who gets such short shrift here.    But read it.  A library copy.   Books, after all, are not free.
0446567337|3.0|I'm sure it's unfair of me, but I keep waiting for another Notebook-esque novel from Mr. Sparks. While this novel isn't by any means a disappointment, it certainly didn't end the way I was expecting (re: hoping!) and I'm not sure I like the path it took at the end. I did enjoy getting to know the characters, but I wish I wasn't \\"leaving\\" with such a bitter taste in my mouth about Savannah. Maybe that's the Army Wife in me, though...  I will admit to crying more than once (while sitting on airplane, no less!). I'll be interested to see the movie when it comes out.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|As a health professional by day and rock drummer/aficianado and musical archivist by night I highly anticipated the release of this documentary. Unfortunately my expectations were met with painful dissapointment. First and foremost, who picked Jack White to represent the new generation of guitarists? Jack White ( I am well versed in the White Stripes, Raconteurs and Dead Weather musical catalog ) isn't qualified to fetch Jimmy Pages coffee, much less play guitar within 1,000 miles of him! Jack White fixating on Son House was such a cliche. What rock guitarist wasn't heavily influenced by the early blues artists like Robert Johnson, Lead Belly, Blind Lemon etc., etc! Picking David Evans ( a.k.a. the Edge ) also was a huge blunder. Nothing personal against these two gentlemen as they seem like relatively  well-grounded, intelligent, generous and personable men. But, how about John Mayer or Derek Trucks  to represent the generation of guitarists who are both young and unlike Jack White highly proficient and musical on their instrument. How about Eddie Van Halen or Neil Schon, Steve Morse, Eric Johnson or Joe Satriani to represent the next generation. Again, nothing against the \\"Edge\\", ( both WAR /Joshua Tree were brilliant albums ) but C'mon he even acknowledges that his \\"signature\\" guitar voice has little to do with virtuosity on the instrument but everything to do with  layers on layers on layers of electronic \\"effects\\"......neither of these guitarists had anything to add to the story. I recommend renting this documentary as listening and watching Jimmy Page ( who looks amazing for 66 years of age ) play \\"Ramble On\\" and being invited to his private record room as he plays air guitar like a kid to an old Link Ray tune! That is the only reason this reviewer gives three stars.  Robert Alderman  Washington DC
0679422714|1.0|I was kind of disappointed.  It's not really the \\"untold\\" story, more like the same old retold politically correct story about \\"Mao killed millions\\" based on crudely faked statistics.  During Mao's time there was a lot of upheaval but the average life span in China was doubled.  I found William Hinton's book \\"Through a Glass Darkly\\" much more useful on what went on in China during Mao's time.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"The Karate Kid\\"  is an entertaining film highlighting a strong friendship, versatile story, and strong action sequences.  It remains a touchstone film in its genre, giving rise to several imitators over the years since its 1984 release.<br /><br />Starring Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and also featuring Elisabeth Shue, \\"The Karate Kid\\" presents one of the most touching explications of the mentor-student relationship ever committed to film. Opening en medias res as Daniel Larusso and his mother Lucille are leaving New Jersey to travel to California, the script absolutely massages the storytelling possibilities and conflicts of picking up one's life, and having to find a way to start over in a new place.  Mr. Macchio gives a realistic performance as he grapples with the forced change his mother's job move to California brings on him, also contending with an attraction to a young woman seemingly out of his league(played by Elisabeth Shue) and the jealous beatings of her malevolent martial artist ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />All of this brings Daniel into contact with a wise Asian handyman called Mr. Miyagi, wonderfully played by the late Pat Morita.  It is the growth of their onscreen relationship, as well as the visible chemistry between Macchio and Morita that makes this film stand apart from one million other lesser martial arts films asserting machismo at the expense of storytelling.  Although it is realistically impossible to teach someone the totality of martial arts Daniel learns from painting houses, fences, and doing like work, this portion of the script is largely comedic.  Additionally, it very effectively fleshes out a father-son dynamic for Daniel and Miyagi which had been missing from each of their lives.<br /><br />The movie spawned three sequels and countless imitators.  Go back to the original source and discover (or re-discover) what makes \\"The Karate Kid\\" such a special movie.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|This movie was creepy as hell and scared the crap out of me! My husband and I both love scary movies and it's not very often that we find one that actually scares us a little. Well, Paranormal Activity got to both of us. I loved it!
B001OB7R7S|5.0|Any musician will tell you that these songs are VERY HARD to play.  There is a reason for that.  The chord changes, though classic in the sense that they're reminscent of a lounge - the complexity of time signatures all require musicians skilled in the rudiments AND cognizant enough to know their limits.  Though now a concept no longer popular as the LP has all but vanished - THE NIGHTFLY recalls a precise time in our country when any thing was possible and the Worlds Fair of 1964 prepped us all for Jet Packs while acknowledging the Bomb Shelter in everyone's basement when 'Brubeck' would be needed in the The New Frontier. My favorites include \\"Walk Between the Raindrops' which conjures Keely Smith and Louis Prima and TIGHT leading of that big old Hammond B2 and Leslie speaker with it's full bass pedals infrequently heard today (other than Paul Schafer's on Letterman).     Fagen sings with his telltale nasal intonation in Maxine where we imagine Maxine and her boyfriend attempting to understand their world of peaceful suburbs in the 50s as the couple fantasizes about their artists future, with no thought of the vagaries adulthood will bring.      Most assuredly a dual treat both in musical and lyrical content.  At home on my iPod today just as it was on my turntable in early 80s when it was brand new.  Listing to WNEW FM in NY I can hear Scott Muny \\"The Professor\\" introducing it with much the same superlatives as I have use here.  I will never tire of listening to it.  Sophisticated music, not for the aurally immature.  Revered by many  and for all the right reasons.
0061703257|3.0|I'm looking forward to the movie and I hope the screenwriter fixed the lame ending.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel up to the end. Apparently, I am not alone. I've read that a lot of people had trouble with the ending. Mr. Lehane did too, it seems. As for me, I was left scratching my head. I won't say any more about that so as not to give it away.<br /><br />Lahane is a good writer and I enjoyed the characters and settings. He made a few mistakes with federal law enforcement terminology but not many. (I am a retired federal agent.)<br /><br />I felt like I was there on the island with the marshals, or I think I was. Read it and you'll understand my confusion.<br /><br />All in all, a good book but with a confusing ending. It made the end of the Sopranos seem clear cut in comparison.<br /><br />Chuck Hustmyre
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I loved this book, but found myself confused and not as interested in some parts of the story, especially the last quarter of the book. Overall though, it was a haunting and powerful story that saddened me, but kept me turning the pages. I liked the ending and the characters were believable. I loved the foreshadowing, and the poetic way Alice Sebold writes. I highly recommend.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Bring Susan to Broadway!!! This lady is so gifted and despite what the British Music  Awards say, \\"she is not cool\\"...SHE IS COOL!  Anyone who can overcome the odds and  adversities that this woman has overcome with so much grace and can still sing like  a song bird is VERY cool.  Three cheers Susan I bought this for myself and all  of my friends, she is a treat for the ears and the soul. Please give us more.
0061537969|5.0|I read this book in the summer of 2008 and I remember lying by our pool, reading through my tears. This book was one of the saddest books I've ever read, but it's also one of the best. It's a story of love, devotion, hope, loyalty, philosophy, and mostly, resilience.    The Art of Racing in the Rain is narrated by Enzo, an aging dog who is loved by his race-car driving owner, Denny. Since Enzo can't talk, he's developed the art of listening and he's become a master observer. Denny meets and marries Eve and they have a lovely daughter, Zoe. You love this family, you root for them. And then Enzo smells something go wrong inside Eve and you know this can't go well. Eve developes cancer and decides to move back into her parents' house along with Zoe. As tragedies befall Denny, Enzo tells his story with compassion, affection and love.    This story made me angry and sad and helpless and hurt and frustrated. As well as grateful and hopeful and happy. This is most definitely a tear-jerker, but it is also in my top 5 favorite books of all time. Enzo's buddha-like observations will stick with you long after you place the book back on the shelf: \\"That which you manifest is before you.\\"    Recently, Universal Pictures bought the movie rights and Patrick Dempsey signed on. If you were on the fence before, I hope that seals the deal! ;)
B000MCH5P4|2.0|This is one of the lesser quality movies I've seen recently. Not because of its content, or performance by its cast, but rather the way the story was told and contrived efforts to \\"educate\\". The world we live in is indeed complex, and inter-connected in mysterious ways. But that does not mean a movie is supposed to mirror that and worse, further complicating by randomly jumping around event time and locations. What purpose does it serve?? What did the director/screen writer try to accomplish? I would be rather surprised if half of the audience did not quit the movie a third way into it at the theater.  The complicated background life of the girl in Japan... was it really necessary? how much does it contribute to the main thread of the story? Problems amongst the youth? Then why the Mexico trip and such? It reminds me of young kids telling stories...often forgot something and go back and forth, and digress to whateverland interests them at the moment. Maybe that's how masterpieces were made these days!    Imagine a school kid doing a composition: the story/answer was simple. you can finish the whole thing in 200 words. but the assignment calls for 2000 words. what do you do? babbling. Yup. That just about summarized it.
