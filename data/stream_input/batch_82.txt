B00SLYZNT0|5|They were perfect and came fast
B004I0ZPXA|5|Everything needed all in one package!  Even new bulbs!  My husband replaced the headlight in my dads car in just a few minutes!  Very happy with this purchase!
B007TH6PAG|5|Helmet looks good. Shipped fast. Fits a bit snug but feels good. Airflow is good and it quiets road noise. No complaints here..I thought because of the price that it might feel cheap or thin but it's solid.
B00C15M4WO|5|Item delivered as advertised.  Strong battery, with reserved power for cranking a 2002 96 in.³ Harley with performance cam.
B00CIB1SZA|5|Got this for my HP and I love it! Instructions helped to put it on and it came off without a hitch and looks brillant.
B00VP8JAD4|5|They were delivered quick and the directions were easy to follow. I put it on the back glass of my truck and keep getting compliments on it. Hail Cobra!
B000EVYGZA|4|This is very good
B00J73C3PQ|5|I have 2012 ram 1500 and the controller plugged in and worked well.
B00R6KVB14|5|This rc car is perfect for everyone
B00BGCP20O|5|Love these boots.  Very solid.  I almost wish I would have gone a 1/2 size down if they offer that but overall a great street riding boot.  ICON is a solid brand and you get what you pay for.
B001JHO9GO|5|Love my little car desk! It makes it a lot easier to get things done while I'm waiting for my kids to finish their appointments. I can load it up the way that I want it, hide my iPad and computer without worries. It adjusts perfectly so that I can work in comfort. Great product for those of you who are constantly driving and need to get work done on the road.
B0054RW1HE|4|It's great being able to take these on and off so easily. I take my Jeep doors off only when the weather permits and having the mounting hardware for these mirrors stay on all the time makes it so easy to add and remove them. The only issue with them is that they are on the small side so the passenger mirror is really hard to get in the right place to see cars next to you and it only affords a limited view.
B00GX5Q74E|5|Great fit.
B009YR00MI|5|Pump up my cars' tires, mower tires. cam jump a battery. AND its gonna be a BIG plus in a power outage. LOVE this thing. I charge it in my truck using an inverter(had one sitting around) and supplied ac cord.
B00QWVGT7O|5|So bright I get to freak people out all the time by hitting the lock on key fob and the lights flash, wait about 5 seconds and watch everyone start asking each other WTF was that?!?!?!
B00QFX0PM4|5|We absolutely love using it.
B011OW8A8Q|5|With temperatures reaching above 90, it has noticeably reduced the interior temp in the vehicle. Yes, it's still hot but I can stand getting in without having to open all the windows and waiting a few minutes.
B00WUG1A8I|5|Brief Review: These are the brightest LED headlight bulbs that I have ever used!  They emit an almost pure white light with only a very small hint of blue.  If pure white occurs at 5000 degrees Kelvin (5000K), then I estimate these bulbs have a color of between 5500K and 6000K.  The 3-sided “COB” LED design of each bulb produces a full 360-degrees of light output.  The focus, distribution, and depth of the beam produced are far superior to those of any 2-sided LED bulbs that I have used in the past.  If you are looking for super bright white LED headlight bulbs with an excellent beam pattern, then these are the real deal!  They are far superior to halogen and HID’s for high-beam (and perhaps low, fog, & driving beam) use.  You will not be disappointed!  In-Depth Review: These LED “bulbs” use COB (“Chips On Board”) technology.  COB’s combine multiple LED chips into one seamless panel allowing for a more uniform emission of light.  This technology can have a big advantage over bulbs that use multiple “discrete” LED’s, especially when a well-focused beam is required such as in a headlight housing.  One problem I have experienced in the past with other LED headlight bulbs is the overstating of their emission pattern.  It is common here on Amazon (and other websites) to see Sellers claiming 360-degrees of light emission output for their 1 or 2-sided LED bulbs.  Unfortunately, that is false information.  As noted in the technical specs sections of the Cree, Philips, etc LED manufacturer websites, even the best LED chips only emit at a maximum of 110 to 120 degrees.  So it is impossible for any single or even double-sided LED bulb to emit uniform light in a full 360-degree pattern.  However, this well engineered StarNill LED bulb has a 3-sided design that really does emit light in 360 degrees (120+120+120 = 360).  This “full circle” emission pattern allows your headlight housing to accurately focus the light being emitted by the bulb onto the roadahead without excessive glare to on-coming traffic.  The kit comes well packaged and includes 2 LED bulbs, 2 voltage / current regulators, 2 “plug-and-play” cables, and a comprehensive instruction manual.  The bulbs are well constructed with fan-driven aluminum heatsinks.  The cooling fans are whisper quiet.  I had to turn the engine off and get out of the car to even hear them running.    The heatsink makes the back of the bulb a little bigger than a standard 9005 halogen bulb.  Specifically, the StarNill bulb has a rear diameter of 2.0 inches and a rear depth of 1.25 inches measured from the mounting base.  A typical 9005 halogen bulb has a diameter of 1.50 inches (most of which is offset to the connector side) and a depth of 0.75 inches measured from the mounting base.  The shaft portion (the part that goes inside the headlight) of the StarNill bulb is the exact same size as a halogen bulb.  See pictures 1 and 2 for side-by-side comparison images of a StarNill LED bulb and an OEM halogen bulb.  These LED bulbs are “instant-on at full brightness”.  By comparison, HID’s can take up to 20 (or more) seconds to reach full brightness.  That’s far too long and unsafe for use as high beams.  I tested these StarNill LED bulbs in a Chevrolet Tahoe that uses a reflector high-beam housing.  I did not have any problems installing the StarNill bulbs other than the “reversed polarity” connector issue associated with many GM vehicles.  Correcting that issue took about 5 minutes.  I started by installing just one of these LED bulbs and leaving the existing factory OEM 65-watt halogen bulb in the other headlight housing.  See pictures 3 and 4.  Only the high beams are on in all of these pictures and the low beams are always off.  As noted in the pictures, the StarNill LED bulb produces a much whiter and brighter light as compared to the OEM halogen bulb.  Next, I removed the OEM bulb and inserted a Sylvania Silverstar bulb in its place.  See picture 5.  During this comparison process, I also measured the actual light output of the three different bulbs using a calibrated photometer.  Here are the results as measured at the headlight lens:  Factory OEM 9005 halogen bulb:  166,500 Lux. Sylvania Silverstar 9005 bulb:  173,300 Lux. StarNill 9005 LED bulb:  Exceeded the 200,000 Lux maximum of the meter.  Judging by how quickly it exceeded the meter’s limit, I estimate the StarNill LED bulb’s output to be substantially over 200,000 Lux...perhaps even well over 250,000 Lux.  One Lux is equal to one Lumen per square meter.  Next, I reinstalled one of the factory OEM halogen bulbs to see how it lit the driveway / lawn / house.  This is noted in picture 6.  Then, I swapped the factory bulb for the (supposedly) brighter and whiter Sylvania SilverStar bulb.  See picture 7.  As noted, it appears to illuminate at the same brightness as the factory bulb and is only very slightly whiter (mostly in the middle of the beam).  Finally, I swapped the Silverstar bulb for one of the StarnNill LED bulbs.  See picture 8.  As noted in that picture, the StarNill LED bulb produces a much brighter, whiter, and fuller beam as compared to the other bulbs.  The difference was even more amazing when I installed the 2nd StarNill LED bulb in the other headlight housing and then went for a test drive down a very dark road!  Pros: - Bright white light with a very minor “hint” of blue. - Instant on at full brightness - no warm up required. - 3 COB LED emitters in a triangle formation provide true 360-degree light emission. - Lower current draw as compared to 65-watt halogen bulbs. - Provide much more illumination as compared to halogen bulbs (OEM or Silverstar). - A great alternative to halogen or HID’s bulbs. - Less expensive than other LED headlight bulbs on Amazon.  Cons: - Bulbs require a little extra (rear) space for the integrated fan / heatsink.  This is not really a “con”, just something to be aware of before purchasing and during installation.  Summary: These StarNill LED bulbs are much brighter and whiter than factory halogen bulbs or even the Sylvania Silverstar bulbs.  They are instant-on at full brightness and turn night-into-day!  LED lighting technology has come a long way in the last few years and these StarNill bulbs are the latest version of that technology.  I wish they had been available a few years ago so I could have saved the small fortune that I spent on all the other headlight bulbs, especially all those sets of Silverstars...never ever again!  Thank you StarNill for this very innovative LED headlight bulb with excellent performance!  Please note that I have been using these bulbs for only a few days / nights.  Only time will tell if they are durable.  I will update this review in a few months, or sooner if I encounter any problems.

B006K8YQYW|5|perfect
B00KBBL4H6|3|Solid construction and easy to read however it consistently reads 4 psi above actual pressure (based on calibrated shop gauges). As it is consistent and easier to read than most I'll continue to use it.
B007XE8C74|5|Just what I wanted.  Works better, more features than an older reader I had at about half the price.  Plus, it arrived several days earlier than expected.  I would definitely recommend it.
B0027TX88I|5|Worked great
B0041LN1L4|5|I love this product. Everyone should have this especially in NY
B00KPP6GTY|5|Love the winch so far had to remote mount the control box because it would not fit in expedition one fj bumper but was planning on doing that anyway.
B00OIAAZTO|5|Great guys there, very informative, super fast shipping, had motor the next day.... amazing. Painted it and installed and works perfectly again. Motor comes with everything you need for a complete installation (Gasket & adapter) Direct replacement for 2005 Yamaha F90. Thanks again , Dan
B000C2WEM8|5|Working without problem.
B009DJTT1K|2|This does not fit 2005 Jeep grand Cherokee rear driverside. Went to replace it and it doesnt fit snug into the slot. Had to remove a portion of the replacement part for the door panel to snap back into place on the door. Ive replace the driver side handle with no issue bought from a different provider. This doesnt match well with jeep Cherokee
B00H7JEQAM|5|Delivered on time and product was as described.
B005ASWL0O|5|Excellent item
B003YCEMUA|4|Just what I expected.
B00X6IYGBW|5|It was exactly what I was looking for to use in my truck for loose change.
B000ET9SB4|5|Great!. I keep it on my bike.  I use it to top off the tires.  Rarely take more than 15-30 seconds- typically, I'll raise the pressure from, say 28 psi, to 34 psi.  The kit comes with various adapters to attach to your battery.
B00NLGDL24|3|Over priced for what it is. Color is a good match but a little too glossy. Its also very flimsy.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works Great. I'd recommend it to a friend.
B00MEJ3JUI|5|great item
B0049E4VJO|5|This is the first rivet gun of this size I've ever owned. Used smaller one for years. I bought it to install window regulator rivets and it works great. I have used Dorman parts several times in the past but never tried their tools. It is well made and works good for what I bought it for. It operates the same way smaller rivet guns do, just requires a tad more pressure to set those larger rivets.
B00WAHUEPW|5|Part worked perfect and saved us money compared to GM part

B00D329B8Y|3|The floor mats are not as thick as I had hoped and my drivers floor mat split rather quickly because of the thinness of the product.
B000C2ZXDA|5|Best traditional wiper blades on the market - hands down.
B00GHT7WPE|3|it is a car part…lol it served its purpose...
B00SK12GKS|3|It's ok...easy install and looks good, but the little &#34;dip-bend&#34; in the windshield distorts the view of the road as you look through it, so that takes some getting use to. It does block the wind better and I can hear the stereo better...so I will keep it for long halls but otherwise I will stick with my stock windshield.
B007TVTAAY|5|Took me less than 10 minutes to install in a 2009 Rav4 and works perfectly.  They wanted $120 at the big box auto store.  Don't know about longevity, but I'll update this post if it burns out quickly.
B00TPXOB08|4|WELL MADE CLIPS.

B004APM12G|5|Great tool works well for pressure and tread depth.
B0036IA6JI|5|Fit perfectly
B00H5PTRV6|5|Absolutely nothing short of awesome. These ramps are everything they advertise and so much more. They're light-weight, sturdy, durabe and phenomenal! Worth every penny.<br /><br />We lugged around heavy home-made ramps that sucked, didn't work well and made us look like amatures everywhere we went!<br /><br />Not anymore. Despite an ordering debacle from Amazon (the advertised price is for two complete sets of ramps not just the one ramp Amazon will originally send you), we have been overwhelmingly happy with these ramps.<br /><br />May seem like a big investment, but they're worth every single penny!
B000AMBHG4|5|Great product easy to install, was a little larger than my original ..
B00F9LKAVE|5|i love it so awesome. the color is nice and bright. fits well. good quality.
B00SK12GKS|5|I have this on a 14 Ultra Classic. Looks great and really helps with the wind.
B000C0UMRO|5|Fit my 2003 RSX type S perfectly!
B00915JI08|5|Good battery. Inexpensive  and arrived quickly
B00BOEFEPC|4|Yes it was just OK.  Not completely satisfactory. One of the first reviews on the site said that it was good to fit to 2014 Nissan Versa Note and that<br />it fits into the drink holder in the front one of two. The fact is that it will not fit to the bottom of the drink holder because the base of the center storage unit is bigger. However I will look for another type of fitting as the unit swivels around.  Quality wise is 10/10.
B000SL4AA2|5|works great! size of a very small toaster
B002C92CUI|5|It is an incredible cover... The feel is really nice and it fits my 2010 Chevy Camaro, like a glove...

B008FIH17Y|5|Bought these for our son who lives in Tennessee. He used them a lot last winter and mentioned a couple of times how nice it was to scrape a window without frozen finger tips or getting a regular pair of gloves wet.
B00JHK81X2|5|Great to have in trunk..hope i never have to use
B00AQ29EY0|2|One broke on the second they I installed it
B007IPSXFO|1|one of the keychains won't sync to the remote, and won't stop beeping. Cheap plastic, packaging is worth more than the device.
B00JQMA4RW|5|Durable rubber mats with a great logo of Jack Skellington
B004XEQMLU|5|I love it.
B002LTTVFI|5|Love this jacket.  Definitely a warm weather jacket.  But i have not ridden with the liner in yet.  Only comment is that it was a bit smaller than the size I normally am in jackets.  But it is a great jacket.
B00H6XPZN6|5|I like this product very much. Very lightweight and flexible. The suction cups are holding very well. The product that i used earlier has the suction cups fallen down frequently but this one has very good grip.  Easy to attach and easy to fold and save.<br /><br />I bought this product at discounted price.
B000IOFVUM|5|Well made very similar  to snap in very happy works perfectly  no flaws
B000GKD5NI|4|This works great, and seems to cut the heat in my car when it is parked in the sun.  Doesn't cover the whole window, but enough to make a big difference.
B00DJDYORU|3|Didn't work as well as I thought it would in the airplane A/C.
B00NOLEM7E|2|Looks great on my Passat grill.  Only issue is that once it's on it can easily be bent backward.  For example you''d really have to watch it when drying your car after washing.  If a towel caught it, it would just bend all over the place.  **UPDATE**  3.23.16 -- Decal is totally faded.  I would not purchase this again.  Needs to have a UV coating.
B00EF3P63O|5|Nice Rack, looks good on my CRV
B001V8U12M|5|Best trailer investment yet. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />OMG.<br /><br />Do it.
B00K8V2QNU|4|Excellent replacement for my ancient Craftsman weedeater. Batteries Plus said they didn't stock that type battery and could not order it. I saved a bundle on the batteries. Very satisfied customer.
B000GV8L0O|5|Looks great on my 1984 V65 Magna, and cuts down on the wind but still enough air to keep you plenty cool. Perfect blend.  Install did take a bit of work, but that was to make it look perfect. Take your time!
B00B32DDDK|5|Airlift kit 88140 did just what I needed for the front axel of my motorhome.
B001SLEPB0|2|It did not fit
B002JP3E2K|5|It fits the windshield of my Legacy really well and keeps it a lot cooler while I'm at work
B00JNL5XQS|5|They fit OEM wheels on a 2005 Magnum RT just fine
B00NGYXA8Q|4|Fit great, and easy to install. Some drilling is required.
B007JSGR9Y|5|Very good.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great, solidly-built product that is easy to read and a good value. Excellent contact from seller and very pleased with both product and follow-up.
B000C9DVVE|5|Installed on a 2006 Pontiac Vibe. One grade below OEM but performs like OEM. No noise or dust! Painted to not rust.
B0009NUG66|4|On a recent family vacation abroad, we traveled by car from NC to NYC to fly out (690 miles each way.) We needed something to hold all of our luggage for a two week trip for four people. Thankfully between the trunk space in our Kia Optima, and the Rightline 100S10 carrier we were able to travel comfortably for the most part. On the way, there was so much noise it sounded as if we were traveling through rock storms, LOL. It was so bad that we considered shipping luggage back via UPS. We then did a quick online search for minimizing the noise in these and discovered our error. Not sure if it's mentioned anywhere, but it needs to be completely filled.(We happened to buy a comforter set while in NY, so it did the trick to fill empty spaces.) Use blankets, pillows or whatever you have to fill the carrier (as pictured) and you should experience minimal roof noise. Also, instead of strapping through the car windows, we used door-clip method for securing the carrier since we don't have a roof rack. This was great because there was no chance of rain leaking into the car windows as we were driving since the straps don't have to go through the windows, and the car doors are holding the straps in place. After learning the proper way to fill the carrier, the trip home was pretty much noise-free. The carrier is in great shape and we would recommend this as an option for travel.
B01092I9LA|4|These make my car seats look so much better. Easy to put on :)
B00S5WNT1C|5|Great Plate I Love it
B008LX7DDU|5|finally fixed my dying battery problem on my XR650L
B000GBBP16|5|Good buy and easy installation
B00VU8Q4WE|5|Can't beat the price for the whole package. Bolt on, its never just a bolt on. With the long water pump there is still 2 bushings that are needed for proper alignment. Good for high reving motors I recommend getting an inline oil cooler though they run hot even at an idle. Bad ass looking I highly recommend.
B00UBIMB1C|5|The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the scent. Rather than some strong solvent smell or a classic wax scent (like Turtle Wax), it smelled like something my wife would add to her bathwater. It was a genuinely pleasant smell.<br /><br />It takes an ounce per gallon of water to do the job. There is no way to measure this, so I just had to eyeball it. This stuff makes suds like crazy, and a gallon of water and suds easily covered my SUV.<br /><br />The bottle says that drying isn't necessary, but I would recommend taking a chamois to your windows, especially if your water is a little on the hard side like mine.<br /><br />My white SUV came out clean with a very nice shine. Will definitely use it again!
B008OX37J6|5|Helped greatly as our landlord would not repair the mold problem, he did not believe but when tested within .02 seconds it turned deep dark purple... Scared indeed, the best mood test everM
B003NHEPEE|5|Good buy-easy installation
B00008RW9U|5|Great Gift!
B00192KZQ2|5|Well built. Universal fittings. I use it because I wanted to see when my RV septic runs clear when I am dumping, not for an extention.
B00O9VZ6JQ|2|Maybe it loosened some grime, but you still have to get in there and scrub, even after repeated applications.
B00WYVPI3W|4|It's a good clock. I have it on my Magna. The only problem is when I got it, there was extra metal on the clock stand and the clock didnt fit exactly as it should. However, I don't even notice it now and it still blends in great with the bike.
B004ROOXK8|5|Great!
B009XINVLU|5|Fit both alpine and JL audio speakers into my roadglide with no modification
B00AZZG8HO|5|Complete satisfaction with product and service.  Delivery was extraordinarily prompt.  The product was exactly as pictured and fit the wheel,  I would definitely ordered from this company again with complete confidence.
B003R7BZR0|5|works great, find installation instructions on youtube from some really nice folks.
B00VZP1IXW|5|Very nice, compact kit!  Checked them out and they work great - nice and bright. I didn't see it in the description, but they do have settings for solid on and flashing. Room in the case for extra batteries. I actually took The battery cassette out of one of them and loaded it with batteries, then placed it loose in the case so it would be easier to set up if needed and still wouldn't require the batteries to be stored in the actual flare.
B004707RK0|3|A good buy for the price. It light weight but durable....Comfortable and don't have you sweaty.<br />I like to ride my bike and it is ideal for rainy weather.
B000VU7NL8|5|Great product. Must have!!!
B0071Q2NJC|5|From what I here on the news. You need to treat your people better.
B006P88TJ0|5|Great for my husbands leather jacket.
B00NPKEOZY|1|These are absolutely ridiculous...they do not stay in ANY of the windows of my Ford Focus at all. They are flimsier than expected and don't keep their shape once opened, they just fall back together. The suction cups don't work either, they just pop off after a couple of minutes. Going to buy the &#34;old school&#34; folding rectangular ones instead.
B00252E782|4|It's a Mann.
B00GHQZONY|5|Works great used it for a warning light works great
B001EAQTRI|5|I had the problem with the AUX input in my car, (rare noise coming out of the speakers), I bought this and it solved it all, really good product!
B00C8UKFIM|5|works like it should
B00CASDZKC|5|The Kick Mat is great for kids.  You don't have to be concerned about dirty marks getting all over your car seat.  My granddaughther loves it because she can now lift her legs higher when in granny's car.
B004ZF499Y|5|Excellent. Amazing hids!
B00IPS4APU|5|I was able to use this to repair a chip in a glass table top.  It worked great and you can barely tell that there was a chip in the table.
B00HKE622E|4|I like to give these things a while before I rate them. I am happy with this product
B001AM8INS|1|Product description does not match the product as far as length / diameter. the description stated 21&#34; long when they are actually 16&#34; overall. Amazon was Great about trying to get the right product but were unable. The problem I believe is the desription Gariel puts on the product. I think its a good product, just not what is advertised. I bought them for a 88 Ford B2 and they were the same length as my stock shock so any help in ride height as advertised is not correct. I returned the item.<br /><br />Thanks
B001O0CBUW|5|shipped and worked as expected
B00UW0D7WQ|5|Good spark plugs. Used them in my Harley and FEELS like it's got a bit better pick up.
B00VXGAO06|3|not bad but always needed constant adjustment.
B000FOIJXQ|5|Wear gloves, and tape off the parts u don't want to blacken. This product is great, and it lasts! Highly recommended.
B000NB874C|5|Good product, user friendly. I will re-order
B001445IZ8|3|Not that great. Cheap design
B000GZDHNQ|5|Nothing lights my fire like this plug. Spark up a convo about how good this plug runs!
B00E1TOSJK|5|I have had 2 brothers racing carbon fiber, I have had no muffler, I have had this without the baffle, and with the baffle in: This cannot be beat and it sounds awesome!! I prefer it over the 2 brothers racing muffler costing 4 times as much; very easy setup and looks sharp on my bike.
B00VXNK490|5|The sunvisor looks good works like  they said it would , I just wish it was a little darker
B000KZ0Q7W|5|Works just like the factory unit
B00F3Q7Q08|5|Was as described and the receiver loved it.
B00J1KPTWE|5|Love it!
B002R0XT9K|5|I bought this item because I found it very expensive in my country- Saudi Arabia - and it work good until the time of write.
B00CEERIOQ|2|Loved the star but wasn't for car window bumbed...
B00UV07AGG|2|Not durable. One light worked and one didn't when I received them. Receive replacement, and a month or so later and one side is not working correctly and very dim and hard to see. Very disappointed. When they work, they look great but, not made apparently to last for an extended period. Come on, a couple of months? Yikes! Gonna have to buy another brand or give up on them.
B002FDL3FG|5|Good
B00MWCA216|2|This part is only marketed half correctly. This part is for replacing the front grill badge only. The trunk badge has adhesive on the tips of the wings since the extend past the badge indent in the bodywork, this item does not. If you use this item on the rear, there will be a relatively large gap between the wing tips and the body of the car.
B00MATVMC4|5|Great can to have for emergency
B00V4KFOCE|1|I did not like these at all. They fell all the way through the seats. There was nothing to hold them up.
B00KJB0IFW|3|No directions were included. Just getting the part essentially triples the cost of the item.
B00KTIBY4Y|5|Great price. Item as described.  Arrived on time.
B001J7T892|5|perfect fit on the back of the flat bed. good price.
B00A7XY07O|5|A+
B00IKJ6UR0|4|best price around good quality
B007TXZ286|4|Worked as advertised, however, it didn't give clear directions on putting the bulbs in, yes you can do it wrong, and they don't work!
B000Z0HVHA|5|Have not used this cord yet but it looks well made.
B00DZOLRGY|5|A great looking product. Fast shipping.
B000CP86ZE|2|I was looking for specific OEM mudflaps, not one size fits all, drill your own holes to fit, mudflaps. These are flimsy.
B007P72CF2|5|nice fit and quick delivery
B000JIND4S|5|My only complaint is that mt car has a weird brake where it means I have to lock this club with my left hand and I'm a righty. Other than that, functionality-wise, it is a good product.
B003G79M2G|5|exactly what I expected
B002NSU0ZW|5|As advertised
B000EVWDU0|5|Fantastic value.  Enough said.
B00EYF5VQK|5|Matched up perfectly
B0041PSM1E|5|Didn't end up working with my trailer. Might have worked for an enclosed trailer where the ramp is relatively close to the ground. Didn't install and gave them to a friend for his trailer.  I think it just depends on how close your tilt or door is to the ground. Overall seemed like a good product and would be great in the right situation. Caliber makes great stuff it just didn't work out for me this round.
B00AKH33MU|5|I am really enjoying it.
B004J30FAE|5|Fit perfectly in my 2006 rancher.  After installation, it cranked immediately, and runs perfectly.
B004LF8YZI|4|Really nice
B001IDCPYW|1|well it looked good but the mirror shakes bad when driving useless really but no hole in side of door also yesterday we were driving and the entire back cover fell off
B002692308|4|not a bad fit
B007MCSM1S|5|This World's Best Papa White Decal Car Window decal was bought for, wait for it, the world's best Papa of course!  My dad thought this was a great little gift that reminded him that he is very much loved.  A fun gift for the Papa in your life!
B005VF7M00|5|work great, stopped right @ 13 psi. ran my 31&#34; km2's on my stock rubicon for over 400 miles offroad going back and forth between trails and road filling up with my viaar pump. did 3 weeks offroad/highway between parks. 4200 miles with 10% of that being offroad deflated. No issues, just buy these, worth it not to have to kneel down and use a rock. Leave it @ the stock setting, and you wont pop a bead, i ran very difficult trails (ive been offroading over 10 years and hit every park on the east coast) even with 31's and never popped a bead.
B00CTREE1I|5|It works excellent
B002JFQFNA|5|read the reviews.....took a chance....soooo glad I did....just like the Ray Bans I owned in  the 80s......just like Dirty Harrys from original movie....great quality.....very impressed
B005FO33RI|5|Very well
B000E4SQIA|5|Part works perfectly!!! Early shipping too :)
B00S6PIXK0|5|ISIS Performance makes quality parts at an affordable price.  There is not much to this high pressure power steering hose for my 92&#34; Nissan 240sx coupe powered with an sr20det engine.  It is well made.  It was easy to install.  It does not come with instructions but there are plenty of DIY material on the internet.
B0009JKI6S|5|Great
B00BPHV18C|5|The videos said this was easy compared to the ignition switch but this was hard to fish the cable down the steering column
B005G5SD6C|2|the grips dont fit zx14 2014 short by 1/2 inch. have to do modifacations. not happy with product
B00D30SCA4|5|Smart looking and tough rails. So far satisfied. It's a tight fit but no install problems.
B0009IQXFO|5|Great product. Leaves absolutely no streaks or spots. I will use nothing else now
B0018YGB1Y|5|great price and quality product
B000C809M4|5|very good
B007KCY7SW|5|It fits
B00B4XBQPU|4|Great item. Say to put on and looks so great.
B00HHGT0RO|5|These hub bearings fit my 2000 toyota avalon xl very well made parts!!
B0084UJITC|5|Perfect fit!!!!!!
B00NU0BSIA|1|Smells like soap suds looks like soap suds and smell does not last.
B00MO919TG|5|Fit my c300 perfectly...and easy to install
B002YXC0A4|5|As other reviews have indicated, I changed out the fitting supplied with this regulator (which was not brass) with the original fitting from the failed regulator.
B00GTJR356|5|Great product, quick shipment, as described.
B00UY6669E|4|Exactly what I wanted
B007NKPG36|5|EXCELENTE
B009TG716W|1|This is a (WAY OVERPRICED) way to make a connection . If you plan to be hooking up a temporary electrical connection I guess it serves as a reusable crimp. does not make a good permanent solution though. And its made very cheaply VERY small and threads will strip easily if you try to tighten to much. Also the end caps you screw on to tighten the wires down are EXTREMELY small and easy to lose. And if you lose one of the caps the connector becomes USELESS and for a buck or more a piece that can become a real expensive problem....SAVE  your money these are way too expensive and M/O a bad choice for an electrical connection.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Fit tons of stuff (2 families on camping trip with seperate tents and gear). Inside of vehicle was full of people so almost everything went in bag up top. It rained tons all weekend and bag stayed dry inside. Very durable material. Ties on easy and secure!
B00029KA8G|5|Perfect.  Exactly what I was looking for.
B000GZPH1G|5|Fits perfectly on my 2013 Moto Guzzi Stelvio. It's amazing how something so cheap and simple can make suck a big difference for those long, highway rides. I love it.
B0049Z3GRQ|5|Good price. Haven't installed it yet. Bought for garage inventory.
B00HN4B4BU|5|COMES AS SHOWN.AWESOME FIT.JUST AS GOOD AS OEM
B000143LHY|3|Did a decent job of masking the smell of smoke. Didn't come close to completely eliminating the smell. Make sure you have a least 3 hours WITH the help of the spray to allow the smell of smoke to disappear.
B001RLXAZI|4|i put them in and it sure made a big difference on how it started
B00ED3YVWS|5|Amazing. Super bright and decent priced!!
B00CFCHSZG|5|Nice quality
B003VY5I8G|4|I did receive the correct seat, as pictured - earlier issues reported by others apparently resolved. Very pleased with the combination of light weight, comfort, and support of the seat. Could not believe how light it was in the box on arrival - and even with sliders and floor bracket it is still much lighter than any OEM seat. Very nice stance, not too upright, not too reclined - obviously this is important as there is no adjustment. Good side-to-side support in thighs, hips, and shoulders areas. Enough padding so the seat does not feel uncomfortable. I have a 34-inch waist, the fit of the seat is just right. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone much bigger. Of course getting in and out of this seat is not as easy as low-bolster reclinable seats, but this is entirely to be expected. Cannot yet speak to the durability of the seat, as I have only used it for one week. The fabric does retain dust and small debris, but nothing that a soft-bristle brush and vacuum won't clear. As noted elsewhere, this seat, as offered, does require a mounting system, either sliders and floor brackets, or side mounts, and mounting bolts, all sold separately. All-in-all, this is a great value and a great entry-level racing seat. PS. I should also mention that I installed this in a Toyota Mr2 Spyder, which is a very small car, and there were absolutely no issues with fit. Also the height of the seat, with sliders and bracket underneath, was perfect. The top of the back is the same as the OEM seat, and the seating itself is just a tiny bit lower.
B007JN5HD6|4|as intended
B0094E0FGM|5|I've owned two V-Stroms and have put one of these on each one! They are well made, sturdy, waterproof, and a great value. Highly recommended!!!
B0066IU6M2|5|Have had for just over a year now. I had it professionally installed in my JKU. Put a power outlet in the back for my daughter to plug all her stuff into and also had another power outlet installed up front for my navigation equipment. I don't use the USB port on the front outlet because I chose to let my daughter have it and the power switch in the back. Not sure why other people are having issues with the USB port or the switch. My daughter abuses the heck out of the USB port when we are out on the trails. To give you and idea of how much we hit the trails, we have put over 20k miles on the Jeep in just over 1 year of ownership. It gets used a lot and has never failed us once!
B000C2UBVE|5|Good quality. Fits E34 535i.
B000X08AX6|4|This is a hard to find plug and is a good value.
B00T9YQYF8|1|THE FIT PROGRAM SAID IT WAS FOR MY TRUCK . BUT IT WASN'T. SINCE I DIDNT TRY IT OUT TIL 31 DAYS I COULDNT RETURN OR EXCHAGE. NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT
B004NMGGTA|4|Nice plug which will keep my snow blower running.
B0027HX2ZO|5|Awesome!!
B001AV90SG|5|works great
B008G26ZGW|1|I've had these headlights for less than a year and the seals are all cracking. Very poor product
B00D568AN0|5|My 1st experience buying something was AWESOME! The product fit my car, and it came to my home on time as well. I will definitely buy something again. Thank You so much:)
B009R8AXTO|5|The sensors that I recieved were grey color. The sensors advertised were black. I bought these to carry as spares.
B00QLFU4WC|1|Don't waste your money on this junk. Applied to my camo UTV and the print washed off this sticker with water. 1 Star is over rating this product!
B00EOXE6MC|5|I get thumbs up everywhere I drive with this sticker on my car.
B00HRXG3E0|3|it,s not looking so good now ,i will need one sone<br />  may get it and lay fiberglass over it ,who knows
B000CKT0Y0|5|1 year and still working
B00LBAC12S|5|Great product must have if you're going topless during the summertime
B0082VK18U|3|It's a cute design and it mostly works but:<br /><br />For me the pink started to fade after a few months. I used a pink sharpee to fill in the color as it faded. The magnet refused to sit flat for some reason so I used epoxy to hold it down. On the plus side, I dont think anyone is going to be able to take it off now. :-D
B0098VFTCQ|5|Great for Diesel engines.
B0089AMESO|5|Color is much more vibrant than expected.
B00LHNSKYC|5|it fit right on my bike, I very happy with the product!!! 100
B002BTIIUC|5|as expected
B00U1OFYWE|3|they sit low as in you sink into the seat. the back of chair has you sitting up straight, not very comfortable
B00GU0OKIW|5|I bought by Jeep TJ and the center console came with a scratch across the top. Was looking online for a replacement console and came across this nice item. LOVE IT! Soft and perfect to rest my arm on while driving. Stuck on the first time. Gives my Jeep a great look inside. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
B00TIOKK04|1|I Return The Part And It Arrived At Parts Player On Thur Aug 13 At 12:59 Pm, But I Have Not Got Any Information On My Credit Thanks. Wilbert Wagner
B000BVRZ74|5|I use this for my shower glass and its pretty cool to see the water slide down so quickly rather than beading.<br /><br />I deviated from the instructions a bit in order to save myself time:<br />I spray this product onto the glass (after cleaning with Invisible Glass) and spread evenly with a micro fiber towel until I see a uniform layer of haze.  The part that I skipped was wiping it off afterwards with a clean microfiber, which took some effort to do.  Instead, I leave the haze on there and after showering, I squeegee off any water that remains and it seems to do the same job.
B002P3U6WM|5|It fits my Honda Accord perfectly. Look so nice
B00S6SDQ5Y|4|Great quality but it is huge.  Should be 25%-33% smaller to be in line with most key chain sizes.  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.
B000C9557W|5|Nice fit for 1992 air pipe
B003SK1R4M|4|This was what I spect
B011GY2YKW|5|Great set of mirrors at a great price!!
B001AMA8MM|5|Good quality product prompt shipping. They ride really nice and they added just enough capacity I needed for my f350 dually.
B006P0WNMW|5|Good oil that meets the spec for my Prius at  a price much lower than my friends at the Toyota dealership.
B006E4SFHQ|3|Not the best fit but it beats staring at the dirty layer under it. Had to find the best way to be able to close the top bin.
B003T07DAI|5|Great
B00EN34U9W|4|exactly what I expected to receive, thank you.
B00O0SRA42|5|Looks good work's great
B001MSVSG4|5|Nice quality.  I purchased one for the rear of my car.  I am thinking of purchasing one for the front also.
B005X4QCAA|5|A really great product--installs easily, and really easy to read as I drive, and at a really reasonable price. Nothing to criticize, everything works well and dependably.
B0006305RY|5|Very good, works great.
B001GJ3DZS|5|This brush did an absolutely wonderful job at cleaning the wheels of my boyfriends BMW 330i. That car is his baby, and he is SO picky about how he takes care of it. This brush far exceeded expectations. It cleaned of all of the dirt and gravel that had wedged itself in his wheels with ease. He has really nice after-market, flat black wheels that are a pain to clean and it did it perfectly.<br /><br />He did mention to me that he wasn't sure how long it would last or for how many washes, but that for how well it works, it was definitely worth the price. And, for a product that will only be used once a week or once every other week, it won't be subject to too much wear and tear.<br /><br />We would absolutely recommend this to anyone serious about keeping their car clean and that cares about all the little details.
B00681BDXI|5|Works good
B0045MX8S0|5|The zippers are in perfect places! You can find what you need with ease! he cover itself seems durable, The material is thick and kept the vehicle safe from the rain so far.
B001XLG5FE|2|Very flimsy.
B00JLZRNDC|5|These work and look great...and they are aluminum instead of similarly priced steel mounts.  Would highly recommend.
B0024E6QOO|5|It's really helping to lower our electric bill in our rv.
B003S2E4UE|5|I used it to reattach the top heavy solar plate that broke off of my solar spotlight.  Worked very well and still holding up several months later.
B00J7HBSSA|3|The color is too blue for my needs.
B000K1PKFY|5|ok
B009MAM26E|5|good quality and seems sturdy, too soon to tell more now
B000BZL0LC|5|Direct fit for my Subaru Outback
B00KO3PELI|5|Yed
B00UU3LT7K|5|I got a flat tire in Kluane Lake National Park outside of Haines Junction, YT on my way back from Alaska.  I initially put a plug in the tire then filled it with air from the Mini Portable MicroStart Tire Inflator.  The pump worked had for 20 minutes before the 200 mm x 55r 17&#34; rear motorcycle tire was filled to 40 psi.  The plug held pressure for almost 50 miles before it failed.  I then replugged the tire and added 8 ounces of Slime then refilled it again with air from the MicroStart tire inflator.  Again the MicroStart work flawlessly.  I would recommend this product for emergency use.<br />I
B00IZA56UQ|1|Completly wrong!<br />It does not fit in my Kia K5 2011 as it says in the description.
B00OZRCVHY|2|It's okay, but fades very very very fast. Got this in the spring and now in August it looks 100 years old.
B00M1ZMBSQ|1|The fingers ripped out on the first ride.
B00697MAMY|1|Did not fit the 2001 impala mirrors
B00B9F0ON8|5|Fit my car perfectly!
B00QRHDIPY|3|I was thrilled that this solar panel is 10% of the weight of a glass panel but I'm kinda disappointed that this 5 watt (advertised) panel only puts out about 1.75 watts. My panel puts out about 125ma at 14v [in bright sunlight at 6000ft altitude] where I was expecting 300ma. I hate to use the words 'false advertising' but they do come to mind.<br />The LED is located in the wrong part of the circuit (as others have pointed out) and it will consume at least 1 hour of charge time per day if left in place. That LED is easily removed from the circuit by opening up the lighter plug and cutting one lead. Removing the LED also nets you 0.2 watts more power (15ma)  into your battery.<br />I think I will have to buy another one in order to keep my car battery charged but at least it will still be quite light compared to my old solar panel.<br />[power output updated 9/3 due to further testing, now 1.75 watts instead of 1.5  - either way not even close to 5 watts]
B000CEG2VA|5|Works great.  We through it over a bunch of small items in the bed of my truck.  It held everything down for over 1000 miles.
B001DONIF6|5|Bought this for my husband for stunting his 636 kawasaki, he loves it!
B00Q2GZL3M|1|Snapped in half the first day at Oceano Dunes.
B00SY3XQHO|4|Good product but it doesn't keep cold the car
B001RMT90W|5|AMAZING headlights coudnt be happier
B00LNN3MRQ|5|Trigger feels lighter but not to light. Seems to have a little better trigger break also. Installed on a Gen4 model 22.
B0006N5RUE|3|Be careful with these, they crack off. But you gotta have them, just carry spares
B00ECLN0HS|5|worked great!  Little scrubbing when it was time for them to come off window and not problems.  Live in Arizona and they did not fade in 115 degree plus weather
B00TNNCZJE|5|Looks good.
B00029JXNE|5|It's a classic.  Works just as good as the one I had as a kid, 30 years ago.  Highly recommend.
B00QMWQMAW|5|Looks to be well made/might last me a while. Color looks good, goes well with my 2000 Nissan Frontier.
B000EVYGZA|5|I'm not an electrician or an engineer but this has been working pretty well for me.
B00A43CDQW|4|Matched perfectly. Only gripe was the pen did not appear to be full of paint, maybe only 30% full, but was enough to cover the spot I needed.
B000KZ0HY4|5|The fob came in good condition as described and on time and neatly packed, my only dissatisfaction is that the fob doesn't have the red panic button at the back of the fob like the standard fob I initially had, but no worries. I recommend this retailer and products.
B00OV7HKA6|1|Good
B00DUXXWDG|2|I used this once so far when I received them. After removing the deck from the dash, one of the tools had already deformed at the tip. I know these have to be somewhat flexible but they also should be durable. I expected to use these more than once!
B00DTB4R9M|5|Very nice holder.  Sturdy.  Plan to purchase a second one for the back.
B00CFQUKTS|4|These fit in a  1989 buick lesabre. Had to take one star off for it not being listed for my car. The olds delta 88 has the same h body frame as the buick lesabre and park ave.  Can't see why its not listed. Check the Wikipedia about the body styles...<br />First box came threw ok. Second with the last three one box was cut on top and none where taped shut for shipping.<br />Lot of things for my car not being listed anymore.... when they should be.<br />So if your looking for parts check Wikipedia, Haynes and what cars have the same body as yours. Always a few listed.
B000XRHRZQ|5|Awesome, better than anticipated and fast delivery. Would buy from again.
B00WVJR0D8|5|Fast shipping , in a perfect fit
B001W8ZK54|5|Worked Great!
B004W4OQ4Q|5|placed my order the 13th, and got it the 17th with the free 2 day trial shipping. total installation was under an hour...piece of cake and looks real good. 100% satisfied with my new lights and will order again. Thanks to Gary for his help with the installation. These were for a 2005 f150
B00P9OF04I|5|I used this on my Honda Accord's headlights and was very pleased with the results. Make sure you use the kit on a dry day, and give the materials enough time to dry -- and keep everything clean. It got rid of all the haziness on the plastic in my headlights, and everything looks good as new. Instructions were easy to follow and I did the project in about forty minutes, total. There was plenty left over to do my car again (later) or another vehicle.
B004I8BEHS|5|these are great.  replaced the pad on my random orbital sander with this and its better than the original.
B00GBQ3YXM|5|Everything was there and easy to follow instructions.
B011TIOOB2|5|Looks great, fits perfect
B00NEL6HK4|4|nice
B002KOGGAW|5|It literally took me 5 minutes to install the risers on. Great Product. Thank you Roaring Toyz. Now just waiting on my lowering rod!!
B00144EOOE|5|Quality Product, as described.
B002E5D97A|2|Brakes fit my vehicle, but there was a squeak that always happened when I backed up and applied the brakes.  Ended up putting new brakes on and these are sitting in the box.
B004MX9HQO|4|Sturdy and handy, but I was hoping the silver color was stainless or chrome plated.  It's not.  It's just painted silver.
B00MJ47KWQ|5|Worked out great.  Great price.
B00V3OR0Y6|5|DNA motoring has been super helpful and provided great customer service. Great lights at a great price.
B00II5YD4S|5|Had one 14 years ago, so glad to have found this!  Works great for instantly drying your car.
B0001EW01W|3|Apparently when I tried to fit them on my crv, it was too big. Surprise that the company didn't ask what year my crv is, so it was a bust. Probably too late to send back for refund and that's ok too.
B000E347PW|5|This item has been on my truck for two years now with no issues.  Great replacement for factory originals.
B00APOCATU|5|Great fit and finish!
B00RGZWIW0|5|The overall design and appearance are excellent. It is not too bulky its actually just right for a trunk and can collapse when you need that extra room. I have only had this for a little while but the construction and durability seem to be very good. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a solution to the mess in your trunk. I will be ordering one for my fianc&eacute;e as well!
B00FAE042U|5|Completely satisfied
B0000AXRKX|5|Fit my Power Winch (1650) perfectly.
B00QU949AC|5|Great product
B00D9C2CDO|5|This product is well made. We just finished an 1100 mile trip from Michigan to Florida. We went through some huge downpours and everything inside was bone dry. We were very pleased with this bag. The zippers and straps are very solid. The straps have a nylon quick release.  We would recommend this to anyone needing more cargo space. We used this product with a Toyota 4Runner.
B00UFERZKO|5|Worked great for what we needed.  Used it while camping to blow up air mattress and recharge devices.
B00V5DI3FA|5|GREAT Car Wash Mitt !!  Buy the Large size unless you have very small hands.<br />These mitts are perfect for dusting the interior, washing the exterior, or using around the house.<br />The durability is good, although under heavy truck wash uses I've worn a couple down in a year or so, and then they become wheel cleaners or engine detailers.<br />As light duty cleaners around the house, they'll last much longer, especially if you hand wash and air dry.
B00KTIVQEW|5|excenllent, works perfectly
B00435EVKS|5|This is the best company to order seat covers from.They fit perfect and if you have any problem they take care of it.I can not put into words how much i love my seat covers
B00BQYCKE8|4|Good towels. Worth the money.
B007P14NPU|3|Works great with most OBDII cars but won't work on my wrangler tj 2000...
B00Q3ECSXE|5|Excellent
B0096R09XQ|4|No regrets with this purchase. I've ridden in below freezing conditions for two hours straight and didn't get cold. Of course I had more layers and a wind-proof heavy-duty rain suit but I could tell the difference.
B00H6XPZN6|5|I received a discount to review this product.  These worked great.  they really blocked the sun and they actually stuck to the window
B008CE0FRO|5|Extremely nice product. Came well packaged and did just what I needed it to. Couldn't be happier with the purchase. Would suggest to all.
B000BVN960|4|Ordered these seat covers two days ago and they arrived on time and super fast. Neat packaging as well. I had my boyfriend install them in my car and he had issues considering they are smaller than universal fit, which is what they say. However, with a great amount of effort we both managed to fit them in our car and they are stretched but still usable. The material is super thin but print is exactly like the picture. They are beautiful and I love how they brighten up my car. Sure to get compliments.  I was looking for covers that would protect my seats and that's exactly what I got so I  am very happy with the purchase. However, considering they are thin and super small and they somewhat sort of fit my 2013 Toyota Corolla, I love them regardless. If only they fit a little bigger. Make sure if you buy these you have a small enough car, not a truck or a jeep. They are smaller than normal universal fits. Otherwise, great purchase!
B001FMT8BO|5|Great item. Fit perfectly .
B00R92O1QQ|5|Love these LED light bulb and the came on time.
B00HFRLPJ6|5|Works great and very visible.  Quick and simple to install.  Make sure to purchase a hitch lock with this to keep someone from taking it because it looks that nice.
B00SMQIL6E|5|Quality product
B006TMR3EO|5|Exact fit!
B00OBWV06Q|5|good
B009TC50LE|5|Perfect replacement<br />100% satisfied
B0068C4ZKK|5|Excellent product
B00MD0TP2O|4|Good shocks and springs for the money! Just make sure you have the right lower control arms prior to purchasing.
B001TZBB3K|5|This towel is like magic, plane and simple It Works!!!
B0040IH1DM|4|Arrived quick, fits well, and seems to work well, some of the welds appear a bit cheap, but for the price, it's a good buy.
B00032K3RA|5|Looks awesome!! Easy to install.
B00N2BTXRU|3|👍
B0052UB5DY|3|Worked out nicely
B000RMT7NC|5|I was the one who originally posted a 2 star review because the battery originally pictured was the one I wanted (big rectangular) and I received the small 6 volt instead.  The problem has been resolved and the correct picture of the small pc915 now shows. I tried to remove the 2 star rating and all it deleted was the text portion so I am now reposting a 5 star to say that the picture now matches what you are buying.
B00L8KR0E0|5|This is an awsome product. Well done flowmaster! Very well built and sounds amazing!
B000C7QHNU|5|Real good product,fast delivery
B00HCTT4PO|5|Great product. Fits like a glove. Good quality
B00UZ0OHIQ|1|There are no warnings about the APP not being available outside US. The company doesn't answer my contact attempts even to tell me if there's an alternative to make it work or if I threw money out.<br />Useless, so far.
B004I0SWH6|5|Taillight fits exactly in place, even with mild body damage around the taillight (the cause for the need to replace the the taillight assembly). Even came with new bulbs in placed. Came when promised.
B0018PSASU|5|used on any brake  component that has rubber .
B00BYH6C1E|4|Fills the gap, nothing gets past it. Very tight fit and tough to get in gap in my car seats.
B00H40SMB8|5|It's nice but not enough separate pockets for my liking.
B00V5B3PT6|5|very nice very happy
B004A6786Y|5|Excellent
B007M5QFWS|4|Great organizer for my boat to keep my phone, keys, and tools.
B00HEB2XEO|5|It definitely fixed the issue and was actually better than the OEM part.
B006L9AY6O|5|😊
B00DMA5MW6|5|Product was better than expected super great price!
B005OJ3XXI|1|This replacement grill fit my Blazer perfectly, but after one northern Ohio winter, the road salt just ate the chrome up. The grill is pitted, and the copper base layer is exposed and corroding also. Amazon will not accept a return after one month, (not unreasonable), but the seller has not responded to multiple e-mails. This grill was a $125 mistake. If I could leave less than one star I would do so.
B001CE4HY8|4|Wear gloves when taking out of box... Very oily
B002TWQRLS|5|These mirrors look great on my motorcycle got lots of compliments about them.
B0052XTSS0|4|Serves its purpose, however the locking mechanism takes up space that could be used on the rack itself. I bought canoe mounts to install on top of the rack but because the width is shorten by those locking mechanism I could not use it. I had to mount the coboe straight onto the rack itself without the mounts.
B000GVNXWU|5|Fits perfect. Inside of the cover is very soft. Does the job. Maybe a little pricey, but hey, it's protecting a Porsche.
B000IG20RW|4|It's grease.  It lubricates.  Only needed for lawn tractor and autos.  No problems.
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Cool down the inside of your Jeep on a hot day with this roll up windshield shade. Easy to install or stow away because it's small and rolls/unrolls. Have used these before on previous vehicles I've owned and they lower the inside temp by as much as 20 degrees and were 3-4x the size of this one. Fits my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Islander perfectly. Not too small or too large. Not undersized not oversized in any dimension. And my dashboard plastic won't become hard as peanut brittle from being baked in the sun for hours on end. The piping stitched on the edges finishes it nicely and is well done. Highly recommend!👍😀
B001DX5JP4|5|eazy to install, worked great, check lite reset automatic in two days
B00IKGKRNQ|4|The LED very very excellent but the air voice is loud and Whistling
B00IZZDRR0|5|We are very happy with our platform step.  It is sturdy and has plenty of stepping space.  Perfect for an extra step for our camper.  Several of our friends have commented on it and are interested in getting one for themselves.
B00EVXET68|1|Didnt smell like vanilla
B00RMNNAKA|5|Item constructed well and bright enough for its purpose: I use a pair for both front (in addtion to light bar) and rear spot beam (i.e. trailer hook-up)
B00H36XX6C|5|This is a very powerful tool for everyday carry (EDC). The light is very bright at 250 Lumens and the rubberized exterior of the square flashlight/charger is well designed and durable. Finally, someone designed a square flashlight that doesn't roll or move when you don't want it to move. The rubberized design not only makes it resistant to the elements but easy to hold in any condition without dropping the light.<br /><br />The battery takes about three hours to fully charge using the supplied USB connector and a computer.  I charged my iPhone 6plus to 100% and again to 96% before it needed another charge. I tinkered with the light a bunch testing it as well, leaving it on for a total of probably half an hour, including a 15 minute continuous run just to see how it worked.<br /><br />The battery charges your devices at about the same speed it can be charged. I also connected it to a solar charger and it charged slower as expected but connecting it to a solar charger was also very straight forward and easy.<br /><br />I like the easy size of the light for carrying in my daily computer bag. It fits nicely in the bottom of a pocket and stays in place. It is easy to stack other items on top and fill the pocket fully or to store vertically if so desired. The on/off button is well designed so the chances of it being accidentally turned on in a bag or pocket are minimized.<br /><br />My only criticism of the light is the door that covers the USB port. It is too easy to open, even a casual brush of the tab will leave it open. And, it pops open with a drop from less than 10&#34;. I'd have liked to see it snap firmly into place for better protection and weather resistance.<br /><br />Overall, for a combination device, this is well done on all fronts and will be a very useful addition to your bag, glove box, desk drawer, or anyplace you may need a little extra power or light.
B00FLKIKQA|5|I bought this for my wife so her leather car seat would be protected after she played tennis.  So far, it's worked exactly how she'd hoped.
B006O85XC2|5|Works great on my XR650L
B009M0S4U2|5|Love the product, came just as expected
B00UJ5YNYU|5|Seem sturdy and put out good amount of light for their size.  Look great on my Jeep.
B002N5T3SK|3|Caps are a bit tough to get off and on. Will only handle a 10' drain pipe. Get a 60&#34;+ one for a 15' pipe.
B001J7BV0Q|5|mounted easily in my engine bay, sound is solid and clear, the plasrtic has been extremely durable despite being next to a chevy 454 big block
B000WO4R9E|4|Perfect fit for 2005 YZ85.  Looked to be good quality but only time will tell.
B001FCG7XG|5|Fits perfect for my 2015 Sunseeker Motorhome.
B00EJ55D6I|5|This is the second chain ive ordered.Quality seems very good.I have been running one for a few months and stretch wasnt bad as I've seen worse with new chains. This prompted me to buy one for my other machine.Shipping was on par and no complaints there
B000CQBNJ4|5|Just what I needed, great product.
B008Y2HNPQ|5|Exactly as described and works well.
B0018YD48C|5|Perfect fit
B00NGZMBI0|3|DOesn't fit very well
B0012X0I9M|4|The problem of this strut is that it doesn't say which side is it (Amazon sent me left)
B005CWSBT8|5|Fit and worked perfectly
B00E3J4LMC|5|I love this sticker, looks great, sticks well, and it's hilarious, I would recommend this to anyone!
B009D6S20C|5|The valves were exactly what I needed to get back on the water!
B009YYVSZO|4|no problem
B0002F9YIC|5|This stuff is the best cleaner out there
B007OW6MD6|5|no problem
B00C73D8V6|1|I got one from Walmart. It worked okay, except the dime slot got stuck. It would not dispense. Finally it exploded. The springs pushed smeverytjing apart and change went everywhere.
B00L4V9ECY|5|Work great and are of great construction. Only weird thing is that the wires are almost like a braded plastic and the insulation within the outer coating can only be described as wax-like? Also, if you use the scotch locks you are an idiot, that is the worst way to connect anything and is guaranteed to fail sooner than later. They offer no insulation from the elements and do not offer a good connection. Save yourself the trouble and do it CORRECTLY and splice them into your existing wiring with butt connectors and insulate with heat shrink or tape. Also as a tip, if you are installing them on a turn signal to resolve a hyper flash, you want to tap these into the ground wire and the momentary 12v that flashes the turn signal, NOT the constant 12v. Also, you will need one for EACH lamp/light bar/pod/etc.
B00FP0G5EK|4|This is a good kit with relay and a 25 amp fuze  if you need such an item. There are no directions or diagrams that come with it. You will need a basic working knowledge of lighting and wiring.If your lights are on individual fuzes you most likely will not need this product. The information provided in the advertisement does not say this. It turns out that I did not need this specific item. Otherwise the Kensun products are great.
B0002NYE0M|5|didn't know if I should buy it at first, Now I could not live without it and I only use it for my pickup truck
B008MCZPB2|2|the size was exactly what i needed.<br />however, the durability of the vinyl coloring was less than desirable.<br />one tiny bump and the color scratched right off.<br />very &#34;pixelated&#34; design no smooth edges
B005A1O4PG|3|There seems to be a bit of condensation  building up..not going to recommend if it gets worse. The compliments don't stop coming after i installed them. Everyone loves the new look.
B0006HPA02|4|I've had mine installed for 4 years and approx 100,000 miles. No problems.<br />I'll be replacing them with a new set in a couple weeks simply because it's past time to do so.
B001IF2BDU|5|They are very easy to install and just takes a few minutes
B0046KIABG|5|Great!!!
B000N5U5UC|5|Good price on OEM battery
B005DSOENI|5|Product shipped fast and was packaged well.  This look great on my CTS!!  Thank you for a great item!
B001O9FXDU|4|Worked fine fit right on.
B000C2WLB2|3|I'm sure it's a good belt, but most Corollas I've seen have A/C.<br />This application is for an engine without A/C.<br />I didn't catch that on the advert. until I had already ordered it.<br />I have yet to hear anything bad about what the Gates people manufacture, so my guard was down when I purchased this belt.<br /><br />I returned this belt and went down to an O'Reilly store and spent more Amazon probably charges, but had the right size belt I needed immediately.<br /><br />I will use more scrutiny when ordering things like this in the future and would suggest that others do the same.
B000GBBP8O|5|Perfect fit for 2004 VW PASSAT GLX V6
B001IS48KG|5|Very strong and durable ramp, well with the money.
B000C5FRHO|3|Failed after a year
B000EQTQGE|5|It fixed my problem with an open heater in the sensor.  Yes I did check the fuse before ordering...
B00FFDV7LI|5|Great little starter still running strong after five months of heavy use!!!
B001EZ8HIM|5|perfect just as expected. Does take patients and some work to install. I did it myself and in some cases it was really hard to reach but was able to finish the job. Thank you Amazon prime for low price and free shipping.
B0084UILT0|3|I bought two sets, one for a Nissan Murano the other for a Honda Odyssey. The mats for the Murano were ok but the ones for the Odyssey were skimpy in terms of coverage--the original manufacturer &#34;carpet&#34; mats were much larger. Considering these are not cheap, I would have liked them to be a little larger.
B003CKIZEI|5|For my 1995 Honda Magna, made it a great highway cruiser! Lopped 500 RPM off highway speeds, and didn't really subtract from overall get-up-and-go! Now if I can only find a fuel tank that wasn't designed from a pregnant lady's bladder...
B007SQ0U5O|5|Perfect fit.
B000RFOOO6|5|A+
B000CMHNY2|5|Nice Product.
B000F34IC8|5|Great product and fast delivery!!
B00E9FEELS|4|We'll see how long it holds up.  So far so good.  It has been on the car for about a month.
B00C4B1F7U|5|Installed this on a 2015 Rav4 in 15 minutes. She's leaving Western Colorado for northern  Ohio soon and this will make her trip hauling a trailer worry free.
B0066TCRN2|5|Easy installation, looks good, and works properly. Feel so much better knowing the component is no longer plastic.
B000NBKI7Q|3|I should be giving it a 4 start, however one of the pulleys was too large. I paid another $20.00 for the smaller pulley and all is working very well. Fine product.
B00IS941D2|3|It is a good bumper for the price. It looks awesome and accommodates a winch and additional lights nicely. My complaint is the toughness. I had it on for two weeks and needed a pull out of some mud. Wasn't even a hard snatch and the welding around the d-ring mounts is separating. Definitely not happy. I may try to weld it back but I'm not confident to even pull from that side now. Overall, it's ok for the money.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This is the best cargo bag for the price. We traveled several times with it and while we were a little slow figuring out how to get it on, it went on like a charm, didn't flap, (there was a super slight vibration one way when we went over 70), and held all of our gear. My kids may love this even more than I do because now we don't try and cram everything in around them!
B000CO7DZ4|4|Solid product.  installed on my front bullguard for my 2013 Nissan xterra.  this might not be for you if you like custom cover or license plate holder as there is an actual side holder for this license plate bracket.  now if all you want is your license plate, you can easily slide it here, extra security securing your plate together with the screws.  I did not mean it comes with the screw, OK!
B00H7HSN3A|5|So cute & got to me very quickly. I love the extra little paw prints in the packet... Thank you
B00651CLCS|5|Love it, Love it, Love it.
B005CLLTL6|4|No issues at all
B0067ECS6W|5|Used this for my 2012 Honda Civic EX with 1.8 and automatic. Right fit and combined with Mobil 1 0W-20 Advanced Fuel Economy Oil saw a 1mpg+ increase in gas mileage.
B00KMR49EY|4|looks great, nice and bright
B00HPTDV6O|5|Exactly what my dad wanted
B004D5GWWS|1|Do not waist the money!
B004T3BI1O|5|This ladder so far has been great. No issues at all. Have only had it for about 5 months, so we will see how well it works next year.
B009DPP6QQ|1|Note: when purchasing the new sct 5015 for a 6.0l ford, you will have the worst trouble getting it to program. When saving stock an error code will pop up. After receiving and updating the sct you will have to call directly to sct and have them send you a firmware update that you will have to download. You cannot get it yourself, you have to call sct and the wait is anywhere from 30 min to 6 hours so be aware.
B0030VTT3U|1|What you get is not what is pictured.
B000ALG0FI|5|thanx
B00DTEESXY|5|Fast, secure arrival. A well made, good fit, and nice looking swing arm bag - especially for the modest cost! Hard to beat!!
B00HH3JWOS|2|Lights look great, but one of the two was broken/not working out of the box. Also, not affecting the rating, but these lights don't fit a Honda SuperHawk.
B00NGQK9YW|5|I bought this for my Kawasaki ER6-N, and love it... It looks great on the bike.. Its not huge in stature but good enough to fit everything from your pockets to it. I have a Galaxy Note 4 and it fits in the top pocket no problem. The larger inside pocket I can put my wallet, 2 packs of cigarettes and my my work and home keys with no issues.. Its waterproof and the magnets hold it to the tank securely. It also has straps as a precautionary measure that do there job very well. All in all it took me 3 months of looking for a decent tank bag, and I am very happy I decided on this one!!
B00GGXER8G|2|Not easy to wire never got it to work put old one back in don't recommend it
B003877BLS|4|The rear shackles and bushings worked great, front bushings did not fit leaf springs.
B003ILT16W|3|Only the left speaker works with cb.  Could hear and use ptt just fine. Wires are a pain but ok
B008N6689K|5|Glad I got it.
B004SF3BFE|5|saved money,always a good thing
B002JNPPVK|5|thank you ..<br />excellent item and fast shipping
B003XNC0YA|4|worked great
B002XL2HVO|4|Good
B004AQZUX2|3|Having trouble with the light working.
B00B9ZJQR8|5|Even the picture is wrong, the part fit perfectly in my 2011 Versa.
B002935IV2|4|A bit pricey, but worth it in the end. I thought about trying to buy cabinet liner but this stuff is a bit thicker and is the perfect size for the Rightline Gear Sport Jr. Car Top Carrier. Recommended.
B001NFVZA0|5|Don't kayak without it. It's a simple item but it sucks up water like a champ!
B000BYPF82|5|Received as expected and works as expected.
B004KEJYAY|4|We filled it with Olive Oil and will use for Wizard of Oz theme in kitchen
B000EALHH6|5|Very good product but no longer carried by COSTCO so I found it on the internet instead.  Removes grease easily on a variety of surfaces.
B005RQWB18|1|Horrible quality. 5 out of the 7 led lights were not working properly.
B005BN54C0|4|It was nice my boo loved it
B003H1R2QE|5|Great cover for the price
B0056NQI2A|5|Good system for any RZR that has air intake at the engine.  Got this when I had to clean air filter after any ride.  Had several friends who burnt motors up because they didn't clean the air filter after a dusty afternoon ride. This seem to have solved the problem since the air intake is at cab roof level instead of in the dust at the wheels.
B00BFWK1IS|4|comfortable and rugged for if you take a  tumble, recently bought another pair just in case
B000CCFYX4|5|Excellent product!
B000C9P5BS|5|Great fit for my 93 Suburban!
B008BZTMYQ|5|exelent
B007RW2Y4Y|5|Very good
B00XY59VDK|5|Picture isn't the product but the part number is correct. I liked how fast it came in the mail.
B005QCJ45O|5|Hard to find deal. Looks great on the back of the truck
B0000V0EB4|5|Perfect
B00JKZG4J2|5|Good material.  Headband is thick enough to keep its shape. Enough tail to stay tied and tucked in.  Absorbs sweat well.
B00075XC58|5|Fit my 2003 Toyota Highlander perfectly. The install would possible solo, but is much easier with a helper to hold one side up while you get the bolts in on the other side.
B003VARFS6|5|Well made and extends significantly longer than the straight cord.
B00EW0CWMI|5|God bless
B000CIQ47S|5|Very good price and convenient shipping.  Arrived as expected.
B000GVEY64|5|Nice bag fits well. Exactly as described.
B00KWMO7V4|4|Custom fit to any floor shape but wish they were a little thicker. Using them in all three of my cars
B007WWRLRY|5|A
B00SU4LXQI|5|They rock and look great! Yamaha V Star 1300
B00G620ZVU|5|Easy to mount and are really bright. Great purchase. Got money's worth.
B00CMMV49A|5|nice fit
B004GIFI54|1|too short for most uses...
B00KHBFRDM|5|A++++++
B00JM623R6|2|So-so product.  Goes on easy enough but only holds up for about a week. Expected more durability. Probably go back to Lexol or Meguiars.<br /><br />.
B004YZIOUK|5|this is my second pair of these on a monster (first bike I sold), and they are great!
B000C9CC1E|5|If you want an exact fit that works perfectly for 1/2 the price. Then this is for you!!!
B00BR1DR2Y|5|Holds up well for automotive  use I have used mine every  day for about two months  no problem. No rips and no stiching  is coming apart
B003VLBPJA|5|perfect for the motorcycle. good price. arrived on time
B00SC6ZRP2|5|It is perfect.  My husband is large and has limited use of his arms and I had to help him latch it.  Now it's no problem, he can do it himself.  He's very happy with it.
B0002SR2RY|5|This is a genuine Lisle Made in USA socket. It fit my 4.7L Mopar oil pressure switch perfectly. It's a space-saving, thin-wall socket cut to precisely match the outline of an oil pressure switch. And it's a win-win. You get a quality USA socket delivered to your home for less than the iffy, whosit-brand sockets at the big-box stores.
B008I7NN8S|5|Great product.  I would highly recommend it.
B007JMOPW6|3|Plastic cover cracked on top of motor.
B00802GIW4|5|Great product easy to install. Plug and play design just as they said. Took me like 30 minutes to install in my car, only because I have to remove my headlight housing to install. Planning to buy high beams and fog lights very soon.
B00OZELM54|5|These definitely made my lights brighter and better. The bulbs light is still legalized by being focused through a projector. I gave these to my mom and took her 35 watt ones. I will be buying these again and I will be buying more bulbs to fit my reverse lights to put the old 35 watt ones to use. I recommend these for a conversion.
B001VC49OO|5|Everything as advertised fast shipping correct fit and good price
B00WID0OEE|5|Keeping my glass shower door clean.
B001D0MJLO|5|Works great!
B000BZG8ZU|5|It's working!
B001DVTVZK|5|NICE THANK
B00CPGGZNS|5|Great light super bright even during the day.  Great price extremely fast shipping Although 2 days later one of the lights completely stopped working and there is no way for me to contact the seller
B00OUM8GLY|5|really helps out on the heat in my car. Just moved and my car sits in the sun all day, no shade.<br />Even my bowling balls do not get hot sitting in the hatch area.<br />This size fits my Subaru Impreza WRX perfectly.
B00OC8MWG6|5|Awesome.....Love it! SO CUTE! Perfect amount of BLING for a lady in her 40's! LOL  Very surprised by the quality for this great price! I was expecting a cheap plastic frame but it is metal and not cheap looking at all. I AM BUYING ANOTHER! Looks cute on the back of my car but now I need one for the front!
B001AIZ5HY|5|worked very well, they look almost new and they were completely glossed over.
B00WY40J9C|5|Looks amazing on my Cardis!
B00FFGOC7G|1|This sticker was TINY about the size of a credit card.
B009IULUUW|4|It's awful cute and we really like it. Works as well as a regular cigarette lighter. I gave it 4 stars because if the eyes lit up when you pushed it in the item would have been better.
B00ARUU3QY|5|Mechanic installed it for me and he seemed satisfied.  It has continued working so I am satisfied too!
B00LCBH9V4|5|This product works awesome. Lifts and holds as its supposed to
B007XZK85C|5|Great value
B003D5J0AK|5|Much brighter.
B00ML7IELC|5|Work excellent and very bright! Need resistors with these.
B001QIUGVI|5|Works good with any car for just doing checks.
B002E2WMVW|5|very nice color and output.
B00V9W6QTW|4|Everything hooked up great,and easy. Mirrors look good, function good but the only reason I am giving it a 4 is the passenger side mirror slowly extends approx. 1/2 inch when in the retracted position and mirror glass shakes more than an OEM mirror like out of my 3500 work truck while going down the road.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I carry large purses, it fits tight.  It does keep it out of the way and can reach inside but getting the purse in and out is a bit of a struggle due to the size of my purse.
B00K1HPPMK|5|performed as expected
B00F6BBCAA|5|Very nice
B00S5NFVDA|1|I have a 2014 Chevy Malibu and this does not fit it. it was horrible
B005BH1HT0|5|perfect!
B00DZL2C84|2|Slots are not deep enough CD's fall out constantly
B00ELJD0BW|5|I bought the ARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hose, which turned out a disaster.  The chuck wouldn't stay on the tire valve. I had to hold it with both hands and it still leaked.  To salvage this dilemma, I bought the Viair (00016) 6' Portable Compressor Air Extension Hose, which had a male Schrader Valve on one end and a female Shrader Valve on the other end that screws on to the valve stem.  I used an adapter to fit the ARB from a kit I had, a Craftsman 11 pc. Air Compressor Accessory Kit 16391 using Teflon tape.  Then I tested it out on all 4 tires of my truck.  It inflated and bled true to the Legacy TH0308 2 inch Dial Tire Gauge with Angle Chuck and Bleeder reading, both at 40 pounds on center.  Update:  People are buying these up and reselling them on Ebay for over double the price here.  It does appear to be an economic opportunity but not ethical enough for me.
B000E2CVIS|5|As expected from K&N as I use many of their products already. Nice to have reliable delivery right to the front door.
B00Q3DNZ2I|4|So far so.good.
B0002SR8AK|5|An excellent tool.
B002UVBZEW|4|fits the car and works as well as the factory installed one did.
B00UG52P7U|5|I have a toddler which means generally my car looks like a tornado ran thru it. I got this organizer to help with keeping her books, toys, and extra clothes in one place, and for the ipad window since we play movies on long trips.  I love it for that, previously she's just held the ipad but she always pauses it by accident or turns the volume up. The window keeps it up for her to sit back and just watch.<br />Even though it doesnt have a strap to tie at the bottom end, it hangs well and the pockets are spacious for everything I've put in them. It was a good buy for sure.
B00144AIAI|4|easy to install
B00GSAUHB8|4|Great, thank you.
B01280RB3S|5|After testing my ignition coil, verified resistance, i moved on to the pickup coil. My 04 bear trackers pickup coil tested 94k ohms; out of range. This little guy fixed my non starting problem. Make sure you get a new gasket and drain the oil prior to removing the cover. A prior dealer estimate came back at $1200! For $25, the $12 or so dollars for a gasket, oil and filter was a much better alturative than getting bent over at the dealer.
B000XETMW0|5|Worked like a charm
B0035B013W|5|Made of good heavy metal & shinny!!!  :)  Worth the money!
B0001L0DFA|5|Purchased this hose nozzle a while back to use each time I need to water my yard...LOVE IT!!!  The nozzle is big enough for what is supposed to be used for.  Several of my neighbors have asked me where did I get it.  This was a great purchase and I'm very happy with all the settings it comes with.
B00AJF5U0G|4|It looks great
B000E35UV2|5|Used in g35 coupe works great
B003SZ6ZJO|5|worked good
B00DJ6J2WY|5|Installed it and started my AVT right away.
B000CQ45TY|5|A place you can trust.
B013ME9PII|5|Having dropped a helmet or two in my 40+ years of riding, this product got my attention. I ordered one and received it promptly. I had to pop out the washer to use the larger diameter hole in order to use it on my BMW, but, that is no issue since it's designed that way. I've tried it with the hook facing both directions; it works either way, and doesn't interfere with the operation of the motorbike in any way. I find that it works quite well for me, a simple solution for a simple problem. It's a well made product for a good price. Order one, you'll see.
B002GZ1TFW|5|I ordered for my Honda Pilot 2007. Took it to Pep-boys. They installed it free for me but usually they charge less than 13 bucks. Working fine. Saved 2/3 of deales price. The product I received was made in Germen & USA. Amazing small product made in two best countrie in the world. I don't complain. It doesn't matter if it made in German or USA as long as it is not made in China. Very happy with it.
B007TY06JA|5|It is made pretty good and fit nice, know to see if holds up under constant use. But so far seems to be working great.
B00VB2OE9O|5|Well made. Sturdy, but not so thick to be unwieldy. I can cover my Kia Optima in less than 60 seconds. A great product at twice the price.
B00FOX5KEY|5|nice quality product
B002YKMD3G|5|tool is as described
B00HEZFZEK|5|always buy this for my YZ 250 keeps the gas clean all year!! Love it
B0051SUMJA|5|Good
B00QHY8CFS|1|Terrible workmanship , mounting holes drilled crooked
B000K009B0|5|Worked great, tried an aftermarket one first and had bad luck. Always use oem.
B003WHM2G8|2|I love it but it doesn't really fit my steering wheel.
B00199PMEK|5|Nicely coated.
B008GNG5LG|1|They do not fit a 2004 VW Touareg.
B0006SU3QW|5|I used this to to cover my window's weather seal on my truck.  It was starting to fade turning gray which really stood out.  Going on 6 months with no issues.  If the seal is already cracked you will have to use a thicker sealer to close the gaps.
B004NFTOLY|3|A bit tricky to install.  Had to modify the mounting to not crush the &#34;out to TV&#34; end. It's does work well, but has a pretty steep learning curve.
B00X5MNWX2|4|switch arrived fast and does as advertised.
B00FQT3G4M|5|Great stickers
B00496TK4S|5|It works. ACDELCO, enough said.
B00V62FS7G|4|It was excellent. I love it
B008N2JIXM|1|What a piece of junk - save your money.  I could have printed something better from my own printer.  This is simply a picture printed on a label.  Absolutely not worth $1.99 let alone $4.99!  Don't bother!
B009UZ1TE2|5|Works Great !!!!!!
B0002SRCMO|5|worked fine
B00Y1HTN92|5|Keys were a perfect match for my Acura mdx. Arrived intact. I had hoped it would have the Acura logo but that isn't an issue.
B00K1C1WC2|5|I wais every car had a set of these in the trunk!
B00N2HQQ3I|4|These are great and last a really long time.
B000SL4AA2|4|Perfect for adjusting pressures as needed, just what I was looking for
B00BRNUCBG|5|These things are awesome.  Get one of the commercial apps to use it... they are about $7 or so.  I now have one for each car.
B000PH6VLU|5|Have other tools by VIM and am satisfied. Worked well on a 2.0L in a '99 Beetle. Took apart with a Torx bit but too sloppy to get an accurate torque going back together.
B00029KBF8|4|It's a good product, just be careful with the plastic inserts they aren't secured well. I already had one fly off on the freeway.
B0050VGZLM|1|Handy for a while, but then started beeping randomly.
B002UC8K3K|5|It was delivered faster then stated, and fit correctly.
B00SH1SN6C|5|this little thing is great.<br /><br />the sensors in my doors that tell me that i left my lights on don't work, and i occasionally leave them on and kill my battery.  since i've gotten the RAVPower portable car jumpstarter, i've never had to worry about it.  pull out the little kit, connect it up, start the car, put the kit away, drive off.
B000H3Q2FC|1|cheap.  screwdriver doesn't fit any of my glasses
B000C42RPK|5|These really brought the rear suspension of my 1992 Toyota 4Runner back to life. Sometimes they feel a little stiff but most of the time I like to slam over speed bumps with such confidence.
B00XBGQ91Y|5|If you're looking for a motion sensor LED light and want to place one in a location away from a wall socket, this is the perfect light.<br /><br />It comes with a back plate which uses 2 tiny phillips screws to mount to a wall, ceiling, underside of cabinet or other surface. Once the backplate is screwed into place, it uses a magnet to hold the light fixture in place with the backplate. The light uses 3 AAA batteries which are NOT included.<br /><br />The light does rotate left to right (or up and down depending on how the light is mounted). The light bulb itself can be positioned straight ahead, slightly off center or lock in place at approximately 170 degree angle in one direction or 180 degree angle in the other direction. The light bulb is feels spring loaded so it's resistant to stay in any position besides the 3 positions mentioned.<br /><br />The LED light gives off a good amount of light during darkness. There are 3 settings for the light: off, on and S which stands for &#34;sensing.&#34; In sensing mode, I tested this light with my 60 pound german shepherd and she was able to activate it once she walked past the sensor. The light stayed on for approximately 15-30 seconds after moving out of range of the infrared sensor.
B00HTOB0NG|5|These did what they were designed to do...can't ask for much more.
B00QU1PHRO|5|fit wel amd works realy good my car started nicely
B000X1Y1LU|5|Fits perfectly!  Excellent quality
B007WD3VCC|5|Had a timing issue it sounded like on my 2008 K8 GSX-R 750 so i swapped out the plugs as suggested on forums and it fixed the problem.  No gaping needed, just pulled and replaced.  Put a little anti-seize on the threads and that was it.
B001BP2SEO|1|they did not work for me
B0002F66G0|5|Met my expectations.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Leather Nova is great.  Turned my dried out chairs into functional like new ones.  I like the lotion better than the spray because I have hardwood floors and the over spray makes a slippery floor..
B00J555GPA|2|-color is good, matches well, can is cheap,... sprayer is cheap compared to other sprayers.
B00TJQCX8S|5|Fit my 2016 F56 perfectly.  They look great too!!!
B00T1718H2|5|good
B00MD0HSKA|4|Parts came on time and fit geat , The car is so much smoother.
B003EM3T22|4|my husband thinks its just want he wanted
B00JBIXJT6|1|Does NOT fit 2012 corolla I don't know what year these will fit Amazon said it will fit 2012 corolla but it does not
B007ED9F3O|5|Directions are extremely vague and had to do a little modifying to get it to work. I drilled holes through the body work to get it to run right where the old radiator mount was and wrapped all the places in radiator hose that could possibly wear through with bike tire innertube.
B004I8Q2HK|5|Perfect Fit! GMC 1500 1995
B00AMJST2U|1|Worst touch up paint ever, color does not match, it is way too dark... Replaces a black scratch by a dark gray scratch.
B008MAX0HA|2|This will fit into a 00' 528i without modification, however the bulb wont fit into the rectangle back.. I got an HID kit and had to adapt this to it, you have to grind it down to get it to fit. Bottom line; it did end up working, its been in my car for over 2mos, but it did require some &#34;modification&#34; to get it to work in my application.
B004INNEX0|5|good quality
B00S4PL3UY|3|Pretty good towel. A tad overrated as it doesn't absorb as much as some people say. It is better than what I used to use but not by much. Would definitely buy again if I see a discount on it.
B00RU3GWZC|5|Just waiting still get this sticker....
B000IOOEIC|5|I have the 1.5 inch Drag Specialties T-Bars, and needed to replace my speaker clamps.  There are not many options for this, luckily these worked great and look good.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|As advertised, well made.
B001O7ICK8|5|One of the best ignition cable sets I have ever installed. Well worth the money.
B000LQ78YY|5|These appear orange in the photos but they are red to my eye.  Work as advertised.
B0097MX2AC|5|very good product
B004MXL58C|4|It came quickly. Looks good. Decent quality.
B00VM8DPYC|5|Fit my Honda rebel perfectly no issues at all holds pretty tight and comes with everything you need would recommend .
B000FTVG72|5|Cool sign
B002FY98YS|2|This does NOT include the bulb cap (bulb retainer) off the back of the headlamp
B00KVO4RZY|1|Picture or description doesn't make it appear as small as it is...maybe worth two dollars if but ten.....never again.
B000CMDA1C|5|Used on a 74 Thing
B005UYVIXO|5|It is the same as regular jb weld but you don't have to wait a couple days for it to cure you can finish a job in one day. This is the only Apoxsee I'm buying from now on
B00JUWB6SO|5|Great product...as adcertised...would purchase again.
B003IS3HV0|1|I highly discourage use of this product. It creates a blotchy appearance of dark spots that do not come out. Basically ruined my leather briefcase. On top of that, the leather feels no softer. Do not make the same mistake.
B007V2CNNC|5|Definitely a difference compared to other shades. Much more efficient. A little more work to put in and take out. Also have to move mirror sometimes. I am purchasing another for other car.
B002UC18HA|1|First this was a bait and switch. What was delivered was an off brand and not a Marshall product. The picture Amazon shows you is not what I got. Cheap construction. Second, one of the two leaks and the other was reluctant to seat. I would have returned them but was leaving on a trip and hand to make do. I managed to repair the worst one my replacing a fitting with one in my workshop. Don't buy this junk. When it comes to something as critical as a gas connection, buy in person so you know what you are getting.
B000CGTKX0|5|Amazing!!! Just installed them on my Evo IX and they are good. Awesome brake response so far.
B000C7LYSI|5|Heavey duty snatch block that works great
B006B14710|3|It ok for the price
B002935IV2|5|Used under a Rightline Gear Sport 2, and did a great job.
B0086QCB0W|5|Great product. Fit perfect and works great.
B00AOA9FUC|5|Look nice and fit on my Sienna 2012 XLE AWD
B0060HPCA0|5|Worked out perfectly!
B00ZG6JKUO|5|Ok I got these, and I am going to be buying more! I keep them in my house or in my handbag ... I give them to kids teens and grown ups, I like giving people a smile, they are bright strong funny and mixed so there is something for everyone. Gave one to my trash guy today he smiled like I made his day.
B000C9CC14|5|Good part and work like it supposed, will buy again if need to.
B00556KKB8|1|This did not work with the 1999 Nissan Pathfinder as promoted. It took a while to sort out the instructions as they seem to have been written by a person who has less no writing skills, but after following the steps, the product did not work at all.
B004A6JA2O|5|Works great- everything advertised.  I can even pull up behind a person smoking a cigarette and I don't smell it anymore.
B00VQUXXWA|5|This surprised me! I wasn't sure the quality of this shade or if it would be the size it is in the pics because things rarely are what they seem, right? I was wrong! I did receive this shade at a very discounted rate for purpose of review, and I'm so glad that I did. I LOVE IT!<br /><br />I had a more expensive shade for my son that I bought at a well known national department store chain. It was awful. It kept rolling itself back up, and it kept falling off my window because it's heavy. When I finally hooked onto the window itself by rolling the windows down a little, I couldn't get the bottom suction to stay stuck on my window so you could hear the &#34;tap tap tap&#34; of it flapping everytime I turned a corner.<br />GOODBYE shade from the store!<br /><br />When I opened this shade from the box, it was folded in a circle. There were two. They just pop open. They are firm. The suction cup stuck right on the window, and it hasn't fallen off yet. The shade keeps the son out of my baby's eyes so two thumbs up from me right there. What I really like about this shade is that it fills up my back window. I've attached a pic so you can see. I drive a SUV, and it's perfect for my back window. I haven't hung the other one yet, but that's because my daughters no longer need a shade. They wear their sunglasses because they are older and cooler lol :)<br /><br />If you're in the market for a shade for yourself or for someone (these would make a FANTASTIC baby shower gift), I recommend these shades!
B003CSNCUC|5|Works great!! Easy to install!
B0041DZ48K|5|Great look on my 2015 JKUR and wasn't that difficult to install.
B001BFOACW|5|Amazon as usual delivered this product on time. Pads are of top quality, great breaking and virtually no dust.
B000C2WF9A|5|My daughter needed a lock gas cap as her car does not have a lock gas door and someone was siphoning gas from her, and others, in her neighborhood. This fit perfectly, and she hasn't lost anymore fuel.....
B005A4JALG|4|expensive piece of foam.
B006L74X0O|5|excellent for  a G35 interior!
B000BQPIGY|5|Quick shipping, great price!
B00TFZO3WM|5|fast shipping, product as described.
B00FFMK17U|5|EXCELENTE
B00ZGUEPVE|5|exellent
B00SZK26T0|2|I bought these led foglight bulbs they are really bright but the seal on them didnt seal properly and now my foglights have moisture in them.
B00B2Q1CD0|5|Fit and finish was perfect, color match exact and functions flawlessly. Fit right over the existing antenna mount with no modification needed. Looks great. Mounted on my 2013 Chrysler 200 Limited.
B00BTBPL4Y|5|Fantastic no need to contact a grandfather service people to oil our grandfather clock.  Save me hundred dollars for service.
B0002STSQM|5|For car-care nuts like me, this tool is perfect. At every tire rotation I measure tread depth on both outside and inside sides of tires to monitor alignment and camber issues.
B0029XJVA6|4|Came in the mail, took a very long time and handle was cracked, not enought to send back. Works like advertised with wobbly<br />handle
B00UX1SO7C|1|These don't fit a 2015 Jeep Compass!
B00IT86XUG|5|Exactly what I wanted thank you
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Fits my 2011 hyundia tucson. If anything, it's a bit large and requires some maneuvering for the perfect fit but....it is the only shade that has 100% covered my large window. Absolutely recommend this!
B00YX7AQOQ|3|Looks like will work good, but for new product show up in zip lock bag not good sign
B005FK7WRE|5|Installed on a 91 Acura Integra. Easy to install. Good stopping power and looks great compared to stock!
B00E3BQM36|1|Says it will fit 2001 Wide Glide is a lie not true
B0101U6OVW|5|#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
B00BCR60U4|1|Product was terrible quality.
B004FFHJ14|4|The screen is actually too big for the windscreen. It is OK though - it just does not fit under the sun visor.
B00F7S78XW|5|Nice addition to my licence plate!
B000VZF6YE|5|Nice gauge. Perfect for dirtbike tires.
B0042HE5B2|5|Had a 4 2 code on my 04 F150. With an 8mm socket and ratchet and 3 minutes of time. The problem has been fixed and my truck is safe again. Worth the cost & time... For the peace of mind.
B007EHOVNE|4|Antenna seems fine.  However, on the Lexus, I never could fully install it because the original antenna has a piece of track stuck inside and the unit is almost impossible to remove from car to take apart to remove the broken track piece... So now antenna won't retract.<br />Very tough install!  Not antenna mfg fault, but hardly a do itt yourself unless entire broken track line is removed and that's the tough part.
B00K6588M6|1|Could not tell a difference.
B0049CNYE4|4|I bought a 3 position Curt pintle mount locally, but it was only rated for 10,000 pounds (according to the sticker), but I really wanted one that was rated for 8 tons. On Amazon they had 3 position models rated for 10,000 pounds and 15,000 pounds (close enough to 8 tons), so I ordered the 15,000 pound model. When it arrived, it looked exactly like the 10,000 model. I got out the dial caliper and all of the measurements were the same. I examined the mounts themselves and no where on the mount is the capacity stamped, it is only a sticker. I obviously can't guarantee it will always be the case, but buying the 10,000 model could save you a few bucks and it is probably the exact same thing as the 15,000 lb. model.
B001EP2904|4|I've had this a year and no issues.  Some buyers complained it falls out - I'm inclined to think it may have fallen into someones hands. 15,000 miles now and no issues.  If it does fall out, I'll buy another.
B00W31VMYC|1|Terrible.  There were no instructions on how to use the device and when I tried to call for technical support it took 3 days of me calling before I could get a hold of anyone and then got passed on to two other people who could not help!  Big waste of $20.00
B001DRJ8JS|5|Great Price - Quick Shipping
B0087FJZUQ|4|Worked about like I expected.
B00GCAW6VI|5|This looks awesome on my camo camander and gives it more appeal then the average 2x2! Saved a couple bucks buying at Amazon too.
B00HWGX188|5|Worked just the way I needed
B000E24APU|5|As described! Thanks!
B008D6HI8K|5|Works great
B000C17GCC|5|Installed this a few months ago and it's still running strong. Now I can run my a/c without overheating, yay!
B000BQR8TE|5|As shown and advertised.  It works.
B00M9WUBBA|4|I bought these so a friend and I could chat while we ride.  They do that very well.  Good sound quality for voice and you don't have to shout into them.  They look good on our helmets and were easy to install.  The two complaints that I have regarding these is this.  First, they don't automatically reconnect to each other after you turned them off.  With other blue tooth devices, they remember each other and reconnect automatically when in range and not connected to another device.  I think these should do that too.  And second, and less of a concern, but something to note, is the music sound quality is not so good as, in my case, the speakers don't actually touch your ears.  I'm not taking off stars for that though, because I rarely listen to music while I ride.  I prefer to hear the road and the bike.  All in all i like these. Again they work well for inter phone and phone conversations.  I'm encouraging my other friends to buy them too.
B00AB4GTYQ|1|There got the sticker.
B00LEBLI82|5|I have used these for several months in my RV and am very pleased. Zero failures. I would order again or recommend them to anyone.
B0042Z0E6E|5|A+
B00UIUV5WO|4|cool lights very bright!
B003FCNX2C|3|It's ok. Not as bright I was expecting it to be
B000F2XU6O|4|this fit very well and matched interior well. very reasonable priced I will get another one for my other truck
B00CRM2MWS|5|Very nice and easy to install. No matter the temp inside the car, my sits are just perfect
B00HS26R6E|4|This Liner is what you would expect. It will do the job at protecting your back cargo area. I deducted 1 star because it lacked a cut out for the lift tab on the under cargo area storage (Where your tire jack is stored).
B004BC10NY|1|was recommended by canvascamp tents to re waterproof tent and acted as solvent as it is mineral spirits and wax- not the correct product for that application
B003WOIT04|5|works great, just as ordered
B000AMW0O2|3|It was much smaller than I expected for the price. Nice graphics, though.
B00Z0N7ZQY|5|product was as advertised and worked well shipping was fast
B000NBVFN2|4|Finally got around to doing the dreaded spark plug job on my 2004 F150 5.4L.  This tool worked adequately.  It didn't seem to hold onto and pull out all of the loose plugs.  But I believe that was because 7 out of 8 broke and they were covered in penetrating oil.  The oil probably got the rubber wet and made it less abrasive to grip.  Other than that, the knurl at the ratchet end made it easy to turn by hand once the plugs were broken loose.
B000XQM1LC|5|As described worked as hoped.
B002TMQ4AM|5|They fit perfect in my car,easy to install.I think there great
B00G2Q5GPA|5|Very well designed product. Very satisfied.
B0026K2MO4|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00BQVF8J0|5|Easy to attach to the Porter Cable 7424XP and does the job it's supposed to do.
B007QC3EQ2|5|Got perfect for my dual alternator setup. Comes with butt connectors but I recommend soldering and using heat shrink.
B00E3ST5QA|5|Works great.  I've only put a couple miles on them but the ride and handling is greatly improved.  I use them with the stock arms and a Teraflex 4&#34; spring lift.
B005UHB6OM|5|EASY TO INSTALL, DOES GREAT JOB PUSHING FUEL TO THE VP44
B00CPGQ1GO|2|i could see how this would work well, but it does not match my kick stand on my 2015 klr 650, it faces the wrong direction to provide support. left it in a parking lot somewhere by accident, but don't care because it was misrepresented. and didnt even fit over the foot of my stock kick stand.
B00M4VT2NE|1|That's the worst engine guard to small obstruct when you going to use the food brake .Don't buy it is extra small don't wasting your money
B004969RCI|5|Nice
B0006MTREC|5|Great fit on the camper and drains as expected. Quick delivery too.  Thanks
B0045MX902|5|I purchased this for my grandparents who own a pop up trailer. It covers it perfectly and it was very easy for them to put on (being in their late 60s). They keep their trailer in a forested area and it protects very well against rain and debris that falls from the trees. It is a good buy!
B00I8IS2P6|5|Complete, correct and on time !!!  Can't ask for better then that !!!!!!!
B00KQNPL0U|3|It's OK
B0042P8ZIS|5|Right parts,and fast delivery !
B00NT5TXP6|5|I got this steering wheel cover to protect my hands during the hot summer, and it works well. On the hottest days with direct sun, it can still be toasty, but it's always grip-able, and always comfortable outside of extremely hot direct sun situations. It's a tight fit (first try of putting it on didn't work, but the second one did), but that's perfect, because a snug fit means it becomes one with the steering wheel. It slides forward and back slightly, but it's not an annoyance to me. I just got used to adjusting it occasionally at stoplights.<br /><br />I'm about to order a second to have a backup. This little steering wheel cover was such a great investment. It's even cute, for a but of fun, as well.
B002IVEJM4|5|Quick shipping, great price!
B001664JOA|5|Comfortable Mattress. A little firm at first but I got used to it after a couple nights and prefer it over the one in my home. Works excellent as a truck bed platform mattress.
B00KTIAZLC|5|Wonderful. Works very well with my vehicle. I love the product.
B012YMDPHG|5|This is a basic scanner that gets the job done! It will display the error and you can clear it. Just note if the problem isn't corrected, the code will return.<br />We used this in a 2007 Hyundai Sonata and a 2011 Ford F-150.<br />The device itself seems to be well built and I see getting many years of use.
B000KW7KC4|5|Awsome exhaust, perfect fit , easy to install, looks good , the sound is way better than I expected
B00BCRMB34|5|Easy to clean, easy to put on and take off, looks great!!!!!!!!!!!  Two thumbs up!!!!!!!!
B00AZJYDQI|5|works great
B00CNT470A|4|initially worked good but with time plastic pins started bending
B00DOZY586|1|Didn't work for me.
B000182EUU|5|Fits great
B000GU1ZFS|1|It &#34;may&#34; deter theft in that it a lock. But I think my kids piggy bank would be harder to break into. I'll use it around the honest people.
B00L9R2E3O|5|They fit surprisingly well and have worked well for the couple months we've had them.
B00NP60URE|5|worth the money!!!!!!
B000BNKWDQ|3|Ok,  but doesn't fit near as well as they should onmy 2005 Trailblazer. They slide around and the passenger side bulges allowing debris to fall onto the carpet. . Not typical Lund quality.
B0018EO5IA|5|Wife loves the new seat and it fit on my 2011 Heritage Softail classic. The only problem if you have the stock seat you can see the seat pins a little and there is a space around the back of the driver seat because the passenger seat sits higher.  I decided to go with total comfort and ordered the solo Mustang seat to match. #76179. I have had Ultimate seats, and the Mustang seats keep the original look and seem to have the better comfort factor.
B001JL4208|5|A great tool box for my trailer, it looks great and functions even better.
B008IT8TAI|4|not to loud. just ads a little bass to your tone. never gets loud
B00GMJ1UE8|5|It's a dark pinlock insert. Not really much else I can say. Works as expected.
B00TGTF5IS|5|Looks great on my ride
B00RU9HD3G|5|I like it... It shipped quick, was easy to install and I like the way it looks in my car(Dodge Magnum)
B00H9S71LW|5|Great and handy unit to monitor all functions of all vehicles. The Android App. is easy to use and easy to customize readouts. A must for those of us who really want to know how well their vehicle is performing.
B0002JSZ8I|4|Just bought this for application on car leather seats (Infiniti G37S), and works great. I have the light leather not the black and I was looking primarily for two things: No discoloring of light leather and good removal of surface stains and dirt. So far it did the job and also left the leather feeling soft and supple. Plus, it has a pleasant smell, no harsh or unpleasant chemical smell. Haven't tried it on black leather. Doesn't leave the leather surfaces greasy, which is what other products have done and something I don't like.
B000WN5F96|2|Too long
B00UYFO7XC|4|good tool to have
B00XXLZ2O2|5|great towels!  super nice quality!
B002L5DYI2|5|I bought these to use with my platform style hitch-mount bicycle rack. A bike or two can obscure my rear lights, and these magnetic towing lights are the perfect solution. I decided on this set for two reasons: 1) the lights are LEDs instead of incandescent bulbs, and 2) the magnets are very strong. I am using some small bungee cords ([[ASIN:B00DPLM5YU Kotap BB-6B Ball Bungee, 6-Inch, Black, 25-Piece]]) to strap the lights to the rack, but I would guess the magnets are strong enough to hold the lights onto the rack even without the bungee cords. The LEDs are very bright and prevent the risk of burned out bulbs.<br /><br />I'm including some pictures with this review. My setup survived a recent ~1600 mile trip with flying colors!
B00B3UZ6J6|2|only lasted on tires for about 3 weeks then turns dirty white and you have to paint again
B00GWQPG1O|5|Wee Willy is the best!  Only wish the sponges lasted longer.
B000CINV88|1|This arrived without the cap... one time use only, come on!
B002VFDBP8|4|Looks the same little different seals but for the price you can buy a case or have the dealer change it for around  $150.00
B003YLIHT8|5|The blower on my son's 2002 Doge Dakota was pretty pathetic. I did a quick search and found that this inexpensive little part seemed to be the culprit.  It arrived quickly and only took my son about 10 minutes to replace (2 bolts that hold it in place).  BAM! his fan now blows on all 4 speeds and the air conditioner cools that cab down quickly again.
B001O0CC1U|3|was ordered for 2010 Colorado only received 20 lug nuts need 24.
B007EXMYIC|5|LOVE UM
B002M4B3Z8|5|Better than expected!! Came with wiring harness and even bulbs wasn't expecting that....Great Product! Tks Jason
B000BOKN8Y|4|This belt dressing works well, when you can actually reach the belts on these newer vehicles, which the manufacturer's try to cram as much under the hoods as they can which makes access to belts quite difficult.  Works especially well on noisy belts.
B002R0RDPG|1|No fit
B00GHT8TSI|3|We have a 2005 Sierra 1500 and this does not fit properly.  The tank is angled different at the top than the original and it has two holes in the tank.
B00E16LTTK|5|Best 6 volt battery you can buy.  Works great on classic tractors and cars with a 6 volt system.  They last a very long time if you keep them on a quality float charger.
B00ZX1ZTJ8|4|I love it but I wish it sparked more in the sunlight...
B00K76NOK0|5|these are top quality decals will be ordering another set soon
B004GCNMDU|5|Easy as ever to install! I passed inspection and all electricity works perfectly.
B001KNYOPI|3|small compact, included everything you will need.<br />Wish it was a bit smaller.
B00V9W6U98|5|I bought these for my 1998 Chevy Tahoe per Amazons guide chart that they would fit: they didn't, but the company was very good in helping me with a wiring diagram and with a Dremel I was able to reshape the outer flange enough to fit them to the body to get a proper fit. I also had to drill​ a couple of new holes to mount them, but that was no big deal. These are so much better than the old factory mirrors. Now I can pull a trailer and not have to worry that I can't see properly behind me also. And... they look nice on the truck.
B00PCL8R5M|5|Awesome sticker
B00NA34Q22|4|It reads DC voltage input, just like you'd expect.  According to my expensive digital multi-meter, its accurate too.  The unit is nice and small so its easy to mount just about anywhere.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the screen is hard to read in bright sunlight.  Another review complained about sunlight visibility with the yellow screen, so I got red instead hoping it would be easier to read.  It's not.  I'm using it to monitor the charging system on an antique motorcycle, so if I wait a minute I've probably ridden into a less sunny spot and can read the screen so this isn't a big deal...
B00MOKLXD2|5|Great price...had now for a year. No rust yet. Looks awesome on my acadia. Love em!
B00G6SEY3Y|5|whats to say
B0002NILR4|5|Excellent cover.  Fits very nice and easy to grip on my Silverado.  Hand positions at 10 and 2 have an extra grip and easy to turn.  many reviews state it is hard to get on.  Put on top of wheel and slowly stretch down.  Put on a little section at a time while stretching.  Very easy, only took a minute.  Nice product!
B00NPY02EW|5|Just what I needed.
B001BFQ0Z2|4|good kits have everything you need, I have a little trouble on valve cover gasket, other than that everything is good
B000BN74PK|5|These were for a Chevy. They fit my ford brackets. Best price I could find.
B008JYXYNY|3|They're a little tight on the seat belts, which makes them hard to adjust.
B00B81780K|5|Great addition to my Curt hitch.  Works perfect and keeps my plug intact and available for use.  Love it!  Easy to install and looks OEM.
B0031ZDU62|5|Fit perfectly , crown vic lx sport , great buy
B000GVH20E|5|I like this bag very much. Quite rugged, rigid and easy to mount. There are 3 compartments. The end compartments are expandable. The center area is a fixed size. I often carry a modular helmet in the bag in case of inclement weather. It's a struggle to get it in or out. Just barely fits. The rain cover blew off on the first rainy road trip. It has an elastic cinch cord around the bottom but I'm guessing that failed. Never saw it leave the bike. Fortunately, no moisture was found in the bag after a couple of hours. All in all I'd recommend this bag.
B00VKI4XVS|5|Used the ace bandage last week when a buddy of mine dumped his bike at Sturgis. I was able to wrap up his wrist and he rode from Needles HWY to Rapid City where he sought medical treatment. For those of you who ride long distances I also reccomend adding potable water tablets and a small pillbox with a variety of medicine like Ibuprofen, alergy tabs and cipro. This bag was big enough for me to add a few of my own items and still fit snug in the bottom of my street glide saddle bag. Thank you! Would buy again from Madison Supply.
B009IFIKAU|5|Direct Fit. Easy install.
B0091B56TO|5|Fits like a charm
B0078IMZ8M|4|A gift for my son, but had difficulty trying to apply it on window ..
B005F9IJOK|5|I have researched this product and am exited to have it now - great quality and price...Thank you...Mark
B0046453M6|5|i ordered two and they are both great. really keeps the car nice. Takes a couple of times to learn how to zip and unzip quickly
B003BHR0RK|5|Works great, I left my key and had to forcibly break the cap at fill-up.  It took some doing to get it off. Didn't hesitate to order a replacement. Keeps thieves out of my tank.
B00DJUIHYO|5|GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT
B00PCEG7A6|4|nice
B00ECW2T38|5|Great buy.
B00BDEP9S0|5|Great tool for the camper who travels to different camp sites.
B004K0TTVM|5|Easy to replace, have not had the problem with the ignitions since.
B00HG76A9A|5|Euro-blend. Worth the $$$, this stuff will keep all of the stray unicorns from punching holes in your oil filter.
B0002SQZR2|5|Why are you looking?? BUY this.. Stop looking at the competitors $90 wax and wonder how much better their wax is.. Trust me.. it isn't. This wax goes on very well and comes off well and leaves a nice gloss to your paint, that said:<br />Any weekend detailer and obviously any professional will tell you NO and I mean NO amount of wax or sealant will make our car &#34;Shine&#34; like glass if you have a lot of paint defects..<br /><br />If you don't have a polisher to get the BEST results from you car wash by removing the imperfections and swirls do this.<br />1. Wash your car with a Microfiber mitt or towel and a quality car soap<br />2. Clay the car with a clay bar kit ( search youtube)<br />3. Dry car with microfiber towel Hint: with a NEW and clean microfiber towel soak the towel with water and wring it out then use it to dry your car, trust me it works extremely well for drying than any other process outside of a leaf blower.<br />4. add sealant or wax or both and enjoy........If you also buy the Meg's sealant and you don't know... Sealant goes first than wax.
B00ZR4324K|5|Love love love  my jeeps new handles
B002GYOSII|1|Bought these due to the reviews on Amazon.  Took them to Nissan they charged me $120 and no warranty to install the two needed sensors.  All good right?  NOPE, now my sensor light blinks initially then it stays on constantly.  Though I paid for the sensor installation and programming, they are not registering.  The boxes said for Nissan.  I have a Nissan Altima 2.5SL 2009.  I am disappointed as I was hoping this would bypass the need for me to pay $379 each at Nissan.  The good part if there is one is that my tired do not go flat as before when the corroded sensors were letting the air out of my tires.
B000M5Y720|4|still didnt used but seems good
B00GLXHM6K|5|These are great!  The only complaint I would have is that they do seem to scratch easily.  That could be corrected, I'm sure, if I had taken better care of them and put them in their case, but I just keep them hanging on my visor.  They really do cut out glare, and the sun and make objects sharper.  I would buy them again and probably will when these are too scratched up to see clearly.
B00E0LI09S|4|These are so tiny you can put them just about anywhere and have some extra light. They look good too. Not SUPER bright but worth more than the asking price non the less. I already ordered some more for other projects.
B00P7I863S|1|These rain guards do not fit a 2008 Camry!
B000BQRBB4|5|The Reflectix FT21024 Tape works and looks great with Reflectix BP24025 24-Inch by 25-Feet Bubble Pack Insulation which I used to insulate the garage door reflect.  Very easy to use.
B00HYJFJSS|1|EPIC FAIL.  The radiator pictured in the product description would have worked just fine, but the radiator I received had the outlets reversed... making it impossible to mount or use.  In other words, the end caps were welded onto the wrong ends (the original radiator is on the left in my photo).  The quality of the construction on the rest of the radiator is also sub-standard (sloppy welds, excess weld material painted over, etc), making a leak seem very likely.  The mounting tabs are all slightly &#34;off&#34; and the bolt hole wells on the sides are also slightly crooked.  As an added bonus, FedEx delayed the shipment by a day... so I can't get a replacement in time for my trip tomorrow.  Which would have been possible if they had delivered on time.
B008HY8RCO|5|great product
B00R969DR4|5|Fast shipping, high quality
B004C65DYQ|5|great
B002PH0E1Q|4|Worked good
B00B6X7PGM|5|good replacement
B00UGDAVKU|4|Quick delivery alright product
B004GYOX5Y|5|Exactly what i was looking for to put rubber strip back around my navigator doors!
B0066SFYMO|5|I can confirm a perfect replacement for a 2002 911 Turbo - the problem is well documented and the fact that you are looking at this item and this review, means that you are having problems taking your key out of the ignition.  My one bit of advice from a 911 perspective, as much as it is tempting to try and do the entire operation from the footwell . . .  Porsche uses lock-tite on the small retaining screws which makes it VERY difficult to break loose (poor leverage and a small screw), remove the driver vent to access the top screw - 45 minute job, good luck!
B000B5ZM6Q|5|covers fit great and stay on even in high wind.
B004RT0BPO|5|Perfect for my off road adventures!
B000CICZTO|5|Perfect fit on my old Subie, matched to my new clutch it is like a new car again.
B00LCFD2YI|4|Pretty nice for the money. Would have given 5 stars if the lettering was engraved, instead of stick-on vinyl. The highly reflective chrome metal makes it a little difficult to make out the lettering when the sun is shining as bright as it does in Florida! Lettering in &#34;relief&#34; (i.e., engraved) would make it easier.
B00XZ9N88O|3|It works but the rubber buttons are not as responsive.  you need to press numerous times for it to function accordingly
B004O844DS|5|Worked better than expected.  Helped to give more cargo space by making the roof a secure option. Easy to install.
B002MAO034|5|Just as described!
B00KDNTU0U|4|Installed easy and looks great! Now all I need is an integrated tailight.
B00DRHNBVI|5|Best Customer service!! / Love the item / Thank you so much
B00E1SM6D6|5|Thank you it was a great deal and everything work realy good highly will recomend to my friends
B00K7935KQ|5|I bought 6 of these for my cars. They are shiny, but that's ok with me - could be spray painted flat black or another color. Polycarbonate should flex and not crack like the cheap abs ones, or corrode and bend like the aluminum ones. Can't beat the value for these! Look great with the black caps for the screws, available at Amazon and &#34;the bay&#34;.
B00KWMG4A6|5|Fit great and looks great. Easy to cut.
B00QL17460|5|Product received as described.  Quick delivery
B000GZPC0C|5|Cable arrived a week before I expected and was the perfect part. Happy to have my bike back on the road again. Thank you.
B00T74VX24|5|Very happy with my purchase. Great battery!
B0100NYS0O|4|Works fine
B00KTHVBW0|5|Exactly as described.  Works great for the remotes where your battery lid had broken.
B001CF4UXU|5|Still have not broke it. Works as it should and take it with me when I'm out mudding for some deep mud. Holds up to everything I have thrown at it.
B004A0BT38|1|Dies after one year
B00NETZ5RM|5|performed as expected
B004ZF3IT6|5|If you're used to halogen or cheaper DC kits, this is a great upgrade.
B0002RNS28|5|Saving this one for later but love it.
B002OUZK7W|5|Product works exactly as described and is good value for money. We have been using ours in Mexico and it gave us a little more peace of mind against possible power surges.
B005SEF6YI|4|It fit the boat really well and it is easy to put on. Will have see how it holdup to the Arizona sun.
B000BGK1B6|5|No problems fit my jayco 27-BH .....works fine
B004L7K32S|5|Excellent product
B00YLVJBSG|5|I brought this for my husband and he really love it
B00RUIX4GC|2|not happy with the product.  Doesn't really work as it should
B001S84MNE|5|Very easy to install and keeps that pesky dash light from coming on, telling you that your fluid level is low.
B0010GDGFY|4|Arrived in a timely manner, was easy to install and works great.
B00BGJBMC4|5|did not fit what I bought them for, but I can put them to other use.
B00JG87JHO|5|Great product. Looks awesome so far
B00WAORFI4|1|Junk they blew off my window two weeks after i put them on
B00CLHGLJO|5|Great product for the price! No complaints so far! Extremely bright
B000IYABG6|5|Good Price, Fast delivery...
B00KF1UYPK|5|Just as presented on the web page.  Very pleased,
B008J4UMX4|1|Ordered the wrong product Needed the whole kit not just cover
B002YXUHU4|5|Fine as expected
B0000AXQPA|5|Nice product
B001PKLWM4|5|Husband loves it. Looks and works great on his golf cart. Easy installation.
B002H8S80C|5|Easy and straight forward to install. Didn't even need to read instructions.  Looks great on the window of my truck.
B0040TC15Y|5|Bought it for the grandson worked out good.
B00WZ9ZL76|4|Nice looking. Good enough for the price.
B00KPW7IXK|1|nothing but the case.  did not fix the problem
B00AC6Y9JK|5|Love it
B00UV42JEK|3|The part's fit around the Nissan emblem is different than shown here. The gap of the 1/2 round opening of the part gradually widens from bottom to top.
B005V0NW90|3|Product is great but it doesn't fit my steering wheel. I emailed the seller and never got a response back.
B00K8NELEA|3|Fits small.....i ordered XL size and fits small, because i have to wear using a leather jacket...im a 54 size jacket, so i think the correct size should be 2XL or more
B00HY8XFQ2|1|Contrary to what the title, description and several reviews state, this arm rest does NOT fit an Audi A6. It's way too small and it doesn't even use the same mechanism
B00DYAF9FY|1|I put this on the hood and firewall of my 75 gmc and in just a cpl hours it was dripping tar everwhere so now iv got to take everthing apart and find a way to remove it
B00HN4IH4C|5|Worked great
B009106VLC|5|I ordered this faucet to replace standard fixture that came installed in bathroom sink for our rv. If fit perfectly and easy install. The shipping was super speedy as well. Thanks
B0029Z1EJA|5|LOVE THEM! PERFECT FIT! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000COCXR2|5|Similar quality to oem. Not the greatest but works. I can no start my truck with the key.
B00K616TSA|4|Quite good, only the spread of the brights can get better, if used in a Huyndai Atos GLS
B000ALG1F2|5|A good product.  Exactly what I needed. The price was better than any other price in my area.  Ed Hirsh
B00AN5UUYI|5|Great deal.
B0015KH93K|5|Worked perfectly...Changed leaking valve with no additional loss in R134a...Was dreading job as I expected to lose Freon and having to pull vacuum to get back to go...Not so with this unit!
B00W1VHFPY|5|Nice item
B00PV6W2KO|5|The blue low light ambiance looks terrific in my Truck.
B00069CN2I|5|Fit perfectly, looked great.  They look like they were made for the truck, not like the cheap looking ones you can buy at the auto parts store.
B000COD8FS|4|Worked fine but it's too short. I should have bought the longer one. I was able to use this one but<br />a longer one would have made things much simpler. With this shorter one, I was unable to hold the<br />can of freon upright. It had to be held sideways due to engine area restrictions on my 2003 Camry<br />which has the port at the rear of the engine compartment in front of the firewall.Not a lot of room to work in.
B008P73JX0|5|Very feminine yet looks good while on a bike.  💜 it with the purple and skull.  I get many compliments. I would definetly  buy it again. Very good quality tank and fits true to size.
B00CZCY5SE|4|The light works well but is smaller than I anticipated because of the curved end. This light would not cover the mounting holes of my original RV light (the square shaped ones).<br /><br />It definitely draws less power than a conventional bulb though and has a very clean white color to its light.
B00656SMNK|5|Works great!
B001TUJ5TC|2|I dis-like the material the gloves are made from.
B00KZD8JV4|1|So bad it make problem electricity in my car don't buy this
B005A83ZKE|5|Perfect. Fixed my rear blower problem.
B000CCMSOW|1|Was told by my mechanic that this will overheat my wires and then I will have other problems, threw it away.
B00KTIUM88|5|This is a great product at a great price, and super easy to connect to the car!
B00DOL3PNQ|5|Amazing look! Great quality! Must have on a v6
B011Q18D14|5|Easy to use!
B00H2VVL0S|3|Great product but can cover is very difficult to open then close
B001O1IY4I|4|Apparently there are predrilled holes in the seat backs, but since they are covered by the fabric, you cannot see them.  Nor can you feel for them.  You need the coordinates, however they were not provided.  I was able to find them online however.  The remaining two pages of the installation instructions were pointless and included such messages as &#34;you will die if you do not follow these instructions!&#34;  Other than that, the cover is as expected.
B000GOJWBS|5|Works as expected. Not too difficult of a part to replace other than the several bolts and screws that need to be removed from other parts nearby.
B00UQTG0NG|4|Had a hard time getting it to line up and close.  But now that I have it works fine.
B002XR7BC8|5|As described
B00CVFIIZQ|5|My favorite color.
B00A14QNP6|5|Good deal
B0009OMYAQ|5|Amazing,Swell,OK!
B00BCNG4Q8|5|Excellent product to eliminate the bad piston and rod assembly.
B001IH8PN8|1|Are what they are... I was not able to use them with the Reese Towpower 74344 Adjustable Class III Towbar I bought,. Not long enough to stretch between both vehicles. Ended up buying the Draw Tite 40604 Heavy Duty Safety Chain Kit (which work great). The issue is, I needed 2 sets of the safety cables plus would have to had bought or modified my tow bar to attach the cables.
B00APOFQYQ|5|This visor was very easy to install matched the color inside the car perfectly.  We are very pleased and would recommend
B0016KHD12|1|Did not fit my car and I had to return it.
B006J6PPJA|5|About a year after getting my truck, the steering wheel started to disintegrate. I didn't like the ones in the &#34;brick and mortar&#34; stores. Found this one and it's great. Great color, great feel and no rubbery crums all over the place. Thanks much!!
B0007ZAJRM|5|Good product and it arrived as expected.
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Satisfied
B00BH110LY|1|Poorly made not what I expected.
B00CHT2KIM|2|You definitely need to order one size bigger than normal.  This is very tight.  I tried to return it but they don't cover shipping so I chose to keep it rather than spend another $30-40 to ship back.  Not a quite helmet.  Anything over 60 mph and it is difficult to hear music even at max volume.  Would not recommend and won't buy another from them.
B003AYW05Q|5|basic skull cap exactly what I wanted for riding my motorcycle
B00ECHY33C|1|Recieved broken glass
B00EK5F7XG|5|I agree with keli about the cable , all I did it was swap it with no problem.<br /><br />Shipping was really quick.<br />And it looks really good.<br /><br />Thanks!
B006VWYLYC|5|great tool
B00DTB4GHK|5|Nice quality
B002JBC5QK|5|Arrived promptly and well packaged for safe shipping.  Mechanic installed with new front fender...looks/ works great.
B008FCE1YQ|4|they look great, but why no sill plates for the back doors ? odd.
B00D3M9B3Y|3|I like this except the hose needs to be able to turn more.
B00A4542H8|5|I bought this wax over a year ago based on the advertising that it would last a year - yeah right I thought.  It lasted a year on all 3 of our cars - an amazing product.  McGuire premium wax rarely lasted more than 3 months.  Save your elbow and buy this product.
B002L9D6YK|1|They both leaked. Yes, I have steel valve stems and they were properly installed according to instructions. I tried tightening them gradually and they kept leaking. I eventually used pliers and tightened them very tight. They leaked no matter what I did, not only at the valve stem but also at the end of the extension where you fill the tire.. The leak was very slow and I probably would not have noticed it until it was too late if I hadn't applied soapy water to them and looked for bubbles. The bubbles were a dead giveaway. If I had gone on a trip with my motorhome, I have no doubt these would have resulted in expensive tire failure. Don't buy these.
B005FG28K4|5|Excellent and on time
B001TNT2Y2|5|Just what I needed.  Installed without a problem!  Great product.
B00KTHYEAQ|5|Took literally 2 minutes to program (2001 Avalon XLS). I loaded up the YouTube video suggested by another reviewer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76rx8TXYUBE) on my iPhone, sat in the driver's seat and just followed along with the 'Toyota Dance'. Had it successfully programmed on the first attempt. Remote works great and WAY cheaper than going to the dealer. I'll eventually purchase a second one to replace my 'back-up' duck tape covered one (which this new one replaced).
B000IY819A|5|very good
B00M3NEBMK|3|A little thick with the layers for head and mouth.  One size fits all was still restrictive for my head.  I wear under my motorcycle helmet, and the mouth flap gets caught when sliding helmet on.
B004A30JJK|5|This furnace was exactly as described. Same fit as OEM furnace. Easy to install... be sure to measure the vent kit though as I had to order a different one to fit in the camper I was repairing. Other than the vent kit great product.
B00YAWT4EW|5|I love this keychain. It's small but that is what makes it cute. The shipping is pretty fast which was awesome.
B001O0XMHS|3|Not sure yet... Time will tell but if anything like the rotors I got then they deserve  one star
B000C8T96Q|5|Fit perfect, installed in 5 minutes
B003WWRDDA|5|smooth finish. no rough surfaces.
B001P29WU6|5|I Love them. They give my truck a unique look.
B0052FRQMI|4|Fit great and looks good but it had machine threads without the screws instead of the plastic/wood thread screws from the factory. Had to buy machine screws from local hardware store.
B00NV2D7U4|5|Was delivered quickly and product arrived as advertised. Looks good and I like the short stems, will look nice and discreet once fitted.
B000GU3KHE|5|great quality, keep bike inside but this cover would hold up great outside, very nice, good fit on 600 cc rocket, lockable, fast shipping, thanks
B000G76SR6|5|Works great,
B002FDKPU0|4|Will it fit on and 06 gsxr 600
B00RAO72P0|4|It looks good on my car , and it looks good for 50$
B0002X520S|5|i treat all my leather with this. keeps it hydrated. my leather is holding up well and lasting longer.
B000GKLWUQ|5|Very good
B00CE2Q4LQ|5|Nice size. Applied to window of van with no problems. Seems to be holding up nicely
B0009YDPFO|5|Perfect fit in the small rear compartment in the new truck (2105 Chevy Silverado High Country). Hard to find something like that.
B00F4N2754|3|I find it a bit flimsy. Though, it is easy to install and use.  I have decided to get a different one that is stronger because the sun here inFlorida can be brutal and will destroy things in a hot car.  I would rather spend a little more money and get a sturdier one.  Iwill keep these two and use them on the back windows when I have passengers or a dog traveling with me.
B000EVWEKO|5|Excellent
B00IKZTRLA|5|Love it, subtle and ready to glean in the sunlight!
B002OUMVWY|4|Bought this with the 10' Extention hose and it serves it's purpose so far.
B00DUGVHTE|5|Dodge dealer said they had no tow mirror options, factory or after market. I found these on the internet. Fit perfectly on my 2014 Ram 1500. Just completed 1500 mile trip and they worked exactly as expected. They showed no wear.
B0037ZAJ88|5|Really seems to stick to metal parts.  I sprayed the under carriage of my car and it seems thicker than just WD-40.  We will see this winter.
B00G3GBV1M|2|There were not 6 pieces. The only led that applied to my 2006 WRX was the dome light.
B00ESH1ETC|5|This cover is very sturdy and can withstand being taken on and off often. I have had no issues with this cover so far. It is a great deal! It ships fast and works amazingly!
B009PQIFB6|5|Great product
B00M50MGSC|5|After reading some of the negative reviews on Amazon, I was a bit reluctant to accept ONLY's offer of a free car cover in exchange for my unbiased review.<br /><br />The model I was interested in was the S-47 for cars that are 177&#34; to 183&#34; in length and the negative reviews were for other models so I figured I would take a chance... I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Some reviewers commented about poorly written instructions. My cover came with illustrated directions on how to cover and uncover my car in 18 seconds and I had no problems following the steps. It took me a couple of minutes to cover my car and I wasn't racing to break any time records. The only problem I ran into is getting the car cover back into its black bag. I could not get it back in the bag but it is not a big issue for me. I just roll it up and keep it in my trunk.<br /><br />My biggest concern was that the car cover would not properly fit my 2010 Corolla. The S-47 covered my entire car and my outer mirrors fit in the pockets like the proverbial glove. I have been using the car cover for the last two weeks and every day it has stayed on securely. Last Friday, we had a big storm with 40 mph winds blow on through the area. I was at work and my car was in the parking lot the entire time. I was worried the car cover would blow away but it didn't budge. I can't speak for other car models but if you have a 2010 Corolla this is going to fit your car well.<br /><br />In addition to the wind, the storm dumped a large amount of wind driven rain and dime-sized hail in a short time. A perfect test for the durability of the car cover. When the storm was over I inspected the cover to find no rips or tears from the hail. I was expecting some rain to leak through but I was pleasantly surprised to find my car totally dry when I took the cover off and there wasn't any residue left on my car from the interior of the cover. I would say this cover has so far proven to be durable. I was tempted to further test the cover and try and stand it while two friends hold it off the ground just like in the product listing photo. I'm a bit skeptical that it can take that kind of abuse and decided against trying that little test since I'm a good foot taller and 100 pounds heavier than the guy in the photo and didn't want chance trashing my car cover.<br /><br />So far I have been happy with the cover but the real test will come this winter. After a long day at work, I hate having to spend more time scraping ice and/or removing snow from my car. I'm excited to find out if I will be able to pull off the cover and just shake off the snow with ease. I will update my review and comment more on durability after a few snow storms. If the car cover can survive a Wisconsin winter, it should be able to survive just about anything.ver and try and stand it while two friends hold it off the ground just like in the product listing photo.

B002OPKLFS|5|real easy to put on where the hooks don't fall off while trying to put on through holes.
B00N5BAWYK|5|Fit perfectly.  Very bright.  Matches my 6000k LED headlight exactly.
B007KP52QU|3|Even though the fit shows these fit on a 93 Chevy 1500 Silverado the parking lenses do not. The headlights fit fine.
B00D96TWC4|3|This plate cover is as cute on my car as the picture shows it. However it states it's a chrome frame & it's not it's plastic. I'm disappointed in this but I didn't over tighten & so far it seems fine.
B00VIVGRS4|5|Definitely a great product<br />Some extra features it doesn't list include a seat belt cutter blade. Emergency lights (red, blue)<br />And dual USB ports.<br />Great product buying one for everyone in my family.
B00DPIFNME|5|The Toyota Bed Extender for my 2012 Toyota Tacoma fit perfectly.  The amazing part about the bed extender was the installation--it was easier than I expected.  The instruction was very easy to understand.  It beats paying a Toyota dealership $200+ for installation.
B000B6AFE4|5|Worked great.  The hardest part was prepping the old backer board from my 1994 Ford Ranger.  I though the backer board would be plastic but, it was more like cardboard and, I had a hard time getting the old rotted foam off the backer board.  Found that a small wire brush worked best for cleaning off the backer board.  Once I got the backer board prepped this new headliner was easy to install and, looked great installed in my pickup.  I was afraid it would be too light of gray but, it was a good match for my interior.
B005UGKJCS|5|Perfect for my FR-S.
B000C9J5GO|5|A perfect fit for my 2005 Buick Rainier.
B00FW1JP9O|5|A huge difference and very easy to install.  I recommended this LED package to everyone.
B004C0LSW8|5|works as advertised
B001715RQS|4|Perfect on my 2013 Mazda 3 Hatchback with Bose system. Did not lose any of my steering wheel controls or power to speakers. I used the front speaker output on the PAC for my subwoofer, because I heard thats the spot to tap into for the lower Hz. Also left the output levels the way they were, and worked out perfect. All I recommend is using a Amp Level Controller if you are sticking with the stock head unit, so you can control the output to the amp with a small dial next to you for the volume of bass etc. All you have to do is plug RCA cables from the PAC into it then send another set of RCA cables towards the amp.<br /><br />The only problem I took one star off is due to the shipping, I waited the recommended week it should have taken to get to my house. Then I emailed the distributer asking where my package was, and they said they messed up and only printed a slip but never shipped it. So I thought they'd at least use priority shipping to get it to me quicker, but did not. Also, the package was shipped in a Splenda box, so that gave me a good laugh.
B0083IAO5M|5|LOVE this kit, super sturdy!
B00AAKPROE|1|Worse product ever. The quality of the product is cheap not good at all. the way it showed on the site it not how it is when you received it,, Even how they packed the item to mail it cheap. Its hard to returning its hard to find a small box or anything to return it the usps  wanna charge me $21.99 to return it on a box I'll  I left it home I can't use it I can't do anything with it. Its a horrible product.  Never again!
B000VB8H3K|5|The best mats you can get!! Pricey but excellent!
B0084UKK2G|4|What can I say about these floor mats?  Custom fit to your vehicle, easy installation and quick to clean up.  I did have to add some velcro to certain areas to keep the edges from rolling, but no one will notice.
B00MI2GHU0|4|Wood
B0055DOG48|4|Worked great!
B0056YQI10|5|Quality Item! I would suggest to everyone to purchase. Item came when expected, and packaging was good.
B001CEJH0W|5|wonderful
B007HBQ22K|5|Product arrived as expected. Was used in conjunction with Thule SUP carrier and carried that plus two paddle boards without any issues. It arrives as a clearly marked genuine Subaru product. Not sure why you would get it from anywhere else at this price. Limited noise and drag from bars as well.
B0055O6RMQ|5|Great price for a great product
B000IZ2CIK|5|Great fit for my 2007 Cobalt!
B00BCRMC1U|5|Very nice set for price!
B00E6A7E0E|5|Great-already in use!
B0089MT60Q|4|I absolutely love this and am so pleased when others notice it except for one thing.  The Doberman Pinscher pictured does not have the breed's typically cropped ears.  It looks like it's a Weimaraner!  I wish there was at least a choice of style.
B0009OMYAQ|5|Works great for taking oil filter out of my 2007 Cobalt!
B00979OE5M|5|They are good gloves not to warm for the summer wile riding my motorcycle and they seem they be good for winter as well I like that the bone print is not pressed on so it does not come off after time using them they fit great
B00T0TYZRQ|5|Fast shipping. Works great for car window. Love it!!
B002L6DMD8|5|They worked well. Eliminated the violent pulsing of the Bendix rotors I bought last brake job. They were bad when new.
B00S04S93S|5|cool
B000S2SKIY|5|Product worked great and priced accordingly.  Installation took about 15 minutes.  Took care of that pesty check engine code P0449 that GM should have recalled long ago.
B003V57NUQ|5|I did not find this as difficult to assemble as some of the others.  My rack came with a diagram which did help.  I will say that I was prepared to spend several hours on this after reading the other reviews so I approached it very organizedly.  It took me about 1/2 hour.  I would suggest laying out all the parts so you can see what you have.  Another hint is that the lock nuts (have the black nylon ring inside the top) go on the corners with the short bolts and the regular nuts go on the longer bolts in the middle.  I would also strongly suggest a rachet to tighten the bolts. If you don't have one you can probably buy a cheap one or find a gear head friend who will lend you theirs.  Overall a tremendous value and not too hard to assemble.
B002X6VXL4|2|This jumpstarter is not reliable. And the worst part of it is the compressor.<br />My experience with it: It jumpstarted fine when I needed it to. But the compressor made it bulky and heavy and many, many times the j-r would fall on its side in the trunk and turn on the compressor. Annoying piece of s-t.<br />A few month after I bought it I could not longer charge it through the AC port. Something shorted inside, i dont know. Had to use a battery charger connected to the terminals to put juice into it. Very inconvenient.<br />My advice: Skip it. And don't even think of buying a Schumaher. They are complete garbage. In every aspect they are worse than stanley.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Excellent charger.  Restored a 2012 Bluetop, that the parts store said was toast to a battery I've used all summer. Only four amp but gets it done.
B009DJWWEQ|5|Great
B004I0E0SG|5|Very pleased with this purchase and associated services for delivery.  Thank you.
B00Z2R1OJM|5|Works great for all my different hex bit. Super organized great product
B0029N7R6G|5|Nice product!
B00UPJB0TQ|1|I ordered the car decal but received a t-shirt iron-on instead.
B00PRME1EW|5|NOT A GREAT FIT BUT IT WILL WORK AND LOOKS GOOD
B001JT0CGI|1|Complete Junk. Radio diag failed the connection and I tested for other possible issues. Not my ground or antenna. You get what you pay for here. DONT BUY
B006VU37AS|5|Shines chrome very nicely!!!
B0014Y82PQ|4|Fits rear wiper for 2009 Prius.  easy to install.
B00UFERZKO|5|Great quality and power output, at a great price. Flexible wiring options. Stable output. Only downside is the noisy fan, if that's a concern for you.
B000K02EDG|5|fit, we'll see
B0001EFSUC|3|Nice product by itself, but if you are like me and just got this product after hearing David Hobby saying that it is safe to get this one through airport security - forget about it. I just got it confiscated last week in the Israeli airport handbag security check.
B00BRAVCSQ|5|Sounds great, perfect length
B0010E1LYY|3|Filter is ok. Not as advertised. There is no difference with old normal filter. It does not block any smell. There is one spot on the way to my work and it smells same as before.
B00LRV932M|1|This sticker wouldn't adhere to any surface in my vehicle.
B00M1HUNDY|3|The good: 1. Product appearance was very close to that in the picture. 2. The rubber lining inside is white so when it starts disintegrating with age and heat it won't leave black marks on my tan steering wheel. 3. Relatively easy to get on.  Not so good: 1. Would have looked good if it had not been so shoddily constructed. The &#34;openings&#34; on the vinyl where the quilted fabric is stitched on are crooked and uneven. The edges are not even parallel to the edges of the steering wheel cover. 2. The vinyl is much too smooth and does not provide a good grip. I've had other all-vinyl steering wheel covers before where the surface of the vinyl provides a good grip. This cover tends to slip when turning the steering wheel, and would have been hard to use had it not been for the fabric. 3. At $24 the product is overpriced. I expected a much better finish and feel at this price point.
B000CKPDUU|5|I have a 2001 Dodge Intrepid had a check engine light for something dealing with the pcm but my mechanic told me to have the camshaft position sensor changed. I know when changing camshaft and crankshaft positions sensor it is better to go OEM, but I was tight on money. I have tried standard products before and havent had an issue with them. Decided to take a risk and try it! Check engine light went off no issues yet. Will update after 6 months.
B0066SSIZO|3|After few weeks of using this part I have to change my opinion. Part had a factory defect, but after mail conversation with URO Parts they checked that other hoses in warehouse were OK. Amazon refunded money, so maybe it was just bad luck...
B00FL08HLI|1|Did not fit right. Tried to return, but I would have had to pay shipping again.
B00XY4MB2E|5|Most definitely love how my car looks at night 💯
B0027HYW5I|5|Awesome!!!!
B00K56PSI8|5|Cute and does the job well
B00EVY344K|5|Excellent!
B0027HYW12|5|Awesome!!
B00YYDO1NG|4|These are three individual stripes, which makes the application a bit difficult in areas with compound curves.  The quality of the material is very good.
B000COCRJ6|5|All as advertised. Correct length for my truck.
B000EQPKG4|5|purr purr purr  instead of that annoying misfiring of the plugs- they looked and felt like they should last- time will tell
B00BMU9C1K|1|cracked when came. lug nuts off. won&#34;t stay on car
B0001EW008|5|Works as advertised easy to install
B00IO9B300|4|Fit and installed with no problems or noise.
B00521K7IC|1|Says it works on 06 z71 Tahoe but they don't fit.  I'm sure I could get them to work but  for $340 I want them to be perfect'; They are not a direct replacement so I returned them.
B000GU3R4K|4|Transaction was great.  Brakes didn't make as much difference as I'd hoped.  They broke in and worked nicely, but don't have the tight feel I was expecting from new pads.
B00C5WPZ4W|5|Came just when they said it would. Saved a lot of money.
B000L50ZVI|5|Fantastic!!!! What a shine!!!
B001CF1RJ0|3|This roof rack is made out of pretty thin tubing, and is pretty tricky to put together alone. I read it clanked around a lot in the reviews which makes sense because there is plenty of wiggle room at every junction where tubing fits together. To remedy this clanky noise I bought black colored silicon from the hardware store and put it around all the tubing at every junction, it no longer makes any noise at all. Also the only thing that holds the main front and rear sections on to the body of the rack are four tiny little bolts, I was expecting something a little more durable but all and all this isnt a terrible rack. I don't entirely regret this purchase but I would not buy it again.
B00QYIG8QW|5|Husband  put it together with light bar pretty easy. Didn't seem to have any problems and no complaints from him.
B00DGVX3YK|2|Had these on my Forc Focus for about a week and they started falling apart.
B00LL6PK2K|5|Everyone with a car should have one..don't just rely on tire sensor.
B000FQ1LKW|2|It's cork, not rubber. It also broke and I haven't even taken it out of the package.
B00YSK0A1W|5|Everything OK
B005N53AM2|5|This item arrived very quickly and my daughter was thrilled with it.
B012KZ5A3E|5|This is my favourite car shading item.<br /><br />Hurry up buy it, its awesome
B00GSAUHB8|5|GOOD PRODUCT. WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIENDS.
B00H7RYTBU|4|works for me, looks good, had some issues but seller resolved them , no problem. would buy again,fast shipping,thanks
B00HXHGIU4|5|Quality Is amazing!!!! My new Jeep is loving it!!
B007NZ7MAG|1|The plastic was cracked on one. Trying to get a replacement at the moment.
B00NP4IWAI|5|I haven't bought a hat in many years so I was skeptical ordering a hat online without trying it on. With that said, this hat fits great, and is very comfortable to wear! For the price you get a high quality hat that's going to last for years to come and take come abuse.<br /><br />The only issue that I have is that the hat shipped from China and it took roughly 2 1/2 weeks to get to me. Normally I wouldn't make a fuss over shipping but I'm a Prime member so I'm used to my awesome 2 day shipping.
B00EB30YHQ|5|The shield fits snuggly over the entire window and is easy to remove.  It really reduced the heat in the car.
B003BJNT0K|5|Even greater than expected! Great for ATV! Quick shipping!
B005RF6G4M|3|Doesn't really fit very well.  Wont' stand up, keeps sagging.
B002DYB2ZI|5|the best
B00363D9Y2|1|came off of my car after one car wash. plastic emblem...cheap item.
B005GNO052|4|Great for the price and they look really good considering. They're not cheap looking if that's what your worried about.  It's not exactly oem quality but they work and they look good.
B0041MCGT6|5|no problems, fit perfect, great price
B005UQQ74C|5|Great product for the price. It's much cheaper than name brand mats and it's very easy to cut custom to your car.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Things a life saver if you have to park on gravel or hot asphalt, plus small enough to leave in back seat so i never forget it
B00UZFPKBE|5|Woo hoo!  Homerun for me!  Bought this on a humble for &#34;just in case&#34;.  Hubby and I went on vacation to SC for week.  I packed my new gadget which my hubby told me was a waste of good money.  All was well and we had no auto issues.  Low and behold...when we fired up the Tahoe to leave the beach-NOTHING...Truck would not start!!!!!!!!!!!!  Out with my gadget that I wasted my money on and voila!  Started right up on first try!!!  Invaluable to me and my hubby that day and stays in the truck!  No more does he say it was a waste of money.  We are going to buy more to give to my sisters for just in case...
