B007C1M8BO|3|I got the 0-3 mos size for my 8 lb 12 oz baby and the onsies are too SMALL!  Most 0-3 mos fit babies up to 12 lbs. Besides that, I really like the onsies - cute and affordable. That's no value when I have to buy another couple of pkgs.
B009AFL3W0|5|I got the dream catcher for my 4 yearold and he just loves it just a perfect size for him to take his bad dreams away
B00839XLF6|4|well to me it was much better and cheaper than the ones you can buy from Wal-Mart in my opinion.Its definitely worth the $7 I paid for it.I was not disappointed with my mask.we had a lot of fun with it,and I think you will to.I recommend this mask,its worth it.
B009XCAVUU|5|My little guy adores Spiderman! And this shirt was a happy addition to his &#34;Wall Crawler&#34; collection! The material is a soft cotton, the image was well done. Definitely work the $.<br />Sincerely,<br />Mrs. &#34;I&#34;
B000N3V76A|4|Pants run a bit short even compared with other Haggar brand pants. order a inseam up from normal and you should be fine.
B00NKA6UR4|2|My boyfriends 2X was fine on him but my 2X was way to large for me. Also the painted heart on the &#34;I Love My Crazy Girlfriend.&#34; Has started to fall off and its only been two months sense I bought it.
B00TXSHXB4|5|All good!
B00ME06ZHQ|5|Husband LOVES his engineering t-shirt!
B00RK07XA8|5|Wow it's amazing
B00OFQZ7G2|5|really soft and warm. Love it.
B001OAMTQI|1|These are not the high quality comfortable socks I'm used to buying, they are scratchy, thin and I know they'll have holes in no time. Disappointing
B00GT3K836|2|Way too tight. Cheap fabric. Way too long.
B0007YY8H0|1|At first sight I thought the bra was nice so I ordered it in blue. However, once it arrived it was what I call the Madonna look or the cone pointy look. So thanks to Amazon's great return policy I returned it for another style.
B00GTIBEU2|4|I ordered these pants along with the matching vest and once I got the correct size, they look fantastic together. Hubby will wear this for our beach vow renewal in Jamaica. Fabric, fit and color are great. However definitely runs BIG! I had to exchange both items for a size down. So I recommend anyone who orders save yourself the trouble and order a size down. Otherwise I would give 5 stars.
B00L31BF5Y|3|Very thin material and fits super snug. Great if you're in shape...not so great if you're not. Runs much smaller than anything else I own this size.
B0016L6BP0|5|My biggest worry when I purchased this petticoat was the length. Turned out to be just right. Great for the price!
B0083IXBDY|5|I love the versatility of this snowsuit and it's so cute!  I got the 12 month size for my son (now almost 7 months and a little big for his age) and it fits well, plenty big so he won't grow out of it before the winter is up but he's not swimming in it either.  We haven't had much cold/snowy weather to require the full snowsuit, but when we have used it he's stayed cozy, and the fleece on its own is great for those cooler but not freezing days.  I regularly put him in it when going out for walks in the stroller or Moby wrap and it keeps him comfortable without being too bulky.  I highly recommend this snowsuit!
B005FPMOA4|5|These socks are cute, but that isn't why I like them. The variety of colors available makes matching clothes easy, and the socks stay on, something that can't be said about all baby socks.
B00CPWBE4C|5|Just as expcted, great quality, they will last.
B00EI96D3M|5|The top is what I expected it's soft and comfortable I bought the peacock/white also. You can't go wrong with the Jones New York brand. I have so many items from this brand they are all awesome pieces. The sleeves are long enough also and I paid under $12 for each blouse how awesome is that. I'm a size 39 in bust and 35in waist 40 in hips and the xl is perfect a little roomy for shrinkage.
B00XXSW1C6|2|The material is funky and cheap looking and def no the color I expected... the &#34;tan&#34; is actually a red brown. Ehh.
B00DGP0R36|3|This shift dress fits well, skims the body, is comfortable, has good sleeve length and pattern is nice however a bit busy.  I wear it with a cream jacket which breaks up the pattern and makes it more flattering.
B00CJRQCT0|3|Love the coat but it fits very snug, I went two sizes up and it's still tight in the shoulders
B000ROD76I|5|I bought these leg warmers as a present for my Daughter on her first birthday. They fit perfectly, not too loose, not too tight. You can stretch them up to crotch level, or you can scrunch them down under the knee and covering the bottom band/shoes with a bit of fabric to create a cute Japanese school-girl look, too. My daughter loves these leg warmers. She will take off all of her socks, but she won't take off the legwarmers or the socks when she is wearing them.
B00VUSADBC|4|The back is not the same in the pic its the same of the front
B00L9SW28A|4|Nice coat
B00F0RIUHI|4|I use this to keep my snowpants up. They work well, are thick, and do not cause any damage to the pant material.
B0131X6RF4|5|I weigh 145 lbs, ordered a medium & it fits. Nice orange colors. The seller included a personal note, how sweet.
B0063OPVZG|5|I Love Hatley products, they come a bit big so the kids wear them for several seasons. I love it. she will wear this for at least 2 years. Thank you Hatley!!
B00CBQ7DTC|5|THANKS
B00M5Q7ECE|5|Great bag !
B006QHN1LG|4|Beautiful
B000UTWNSS|4|NO reflection whatsoever toward purveyor.    Tie is not as good as it \\"looks\\" on line.  It is merely an \\"ok\\" and kind of outdated sort of design.    I think I would go with something more contemporary.
B00DMZOY3E|3|Love this top should have ordered a LG instead of xlg.
B00AOH8VA0|5|excellent
B00LWGCXC4|1|Too expensive And seethrough
B00AFRU3LO|5|Good quality. Pushes up the bust. I got it in the red, magenta-like color in small. Good color for Valentine's Day. I'm 5'10, about 130 pounds, and wear a size 34A.
B005GLHDI0|3|I normally wear a 14 long, I ordered the 15/16 long jeans because others stated the jeans ran small. They were too tight, length was great. I was afraid to order up another size as they may be too large. I wish they ran true to size, because they are really cute jeans.
B005ACFQES|5|Like most of the Lucky Brand clothes I have purchased this shot to the top of my &#34;most loved&#34; list! Very comfortable and lightweight. It has held up well after a number of washings. Lucky Brand make stylish clothes in plus-sizes and I am so glad I found the brand.
B00O29RKT4|5|I love these leggings. I wear them for yoga and for general day to day wear. They probably wouldn't work very well for running or hot yoga. I have 4 pairs.<br /><br />I would probably go a size smaller than you're expecting. They'll be tighter at first, but they loosen after some wear. I originally bought S, but ended up having to buy XS because the S stretched and were kind of baggy.
B00R54GFYY|4|My wife loves it
B008U0L97U|1|Do not buy these suspenders!!!!!!!!!! They are junk. Cheap metal parts that fall apart easily.
B0024DST22|5|I bought these to replace some well worn ones I bought a couple years ago. These fit well, the petals conceal well, and they are fairly nice looking for daily wear.
B0002TV2RE|4|These are good socks and Amazon has a stellar price on this three-pack of male hosiery. Wool socks seem to be more comfortable than I thought and are not as sweaty as I originally thought. While I have worn mercerized cotton for the most part, I believe that these may be superior superior in the long run.  Despite its advantages, OTC wool socks are somewhat hard to find among men's clothing stores if you choose to go that route.
B000ULSETS|4|It's cute but made of plastic feed bag material.  I decided not to use it for change, but I'm keeping my lottery tickets in it.  Hope it's lucky.
B00CFU78A8|5|beautiful
B000WO89LQ|5|The overalls fit perfectly and my grandson was so excited to have a pair.
B003WLWTXA|5|Okay, maybe not. But I did want to post a quick review. Good shirt, seems like it could stand up to a few Jayne-style shenanigans. It fits me loosely (probably because I'm not a size M male) and my size M male fiance perfectly.<br /><br />Buy this gorram shirt before you get kidnapped by hill folk.
B00ENGSYEG|4|I'm very happy with the bra.  It fits well, washes well, and the color is beautiful.  Not too much padding - which isn't needed by full figured women - but sufficient support and a comfortable band.  I would definitely buy again.
B005JD3U82|5|I really like these socks for young boys.  They are sturdy and stand up to many washes.  They are nice enough to wear to church but are not glossy looking so can be worn with causal clothes as well.  I would recommend these!
B00NYN8A5C|5|Nice suit
B001UE74BI|5|Great Product!
B00GTFBG7G|2|I am really disappointed it is a size six and how can that be a large size? I did not fit this dress and don't want the hassle of returning it. Please correct your sizing.
B00LXVWWD8|3|TOO SMALL
B00J5AR9QO|5|I'm a dude, and a manly one at that.  However, I enjoy buying clothes for my little 6 month old girl.  I figured something of the Calvin Klein brand would be well made and fashionable, and therefore would excite my wife too.<br /><br />This &#34;Trim Stretchie&#34; arrived quickly and fit our daughter well after a Dreft wash.  She's 6 months old and in the 94th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight.  She has plenty of room to grow laterally, and she can grow about another inch and be perfectly fine in this.<br /><br />This was easily worth the price.
B00KWJ6LJ8|5|he loved it
B00ZK2RF9W|1|I love the design, which made me get the shirt. When I received it, I was a bit disappointed. The pocket square logo fell was located almost on the left center of the shirt, falling below my nipple and giving the shirt an extremely weird look. Very disappointed ...
B005PVO82A|5|Good quality silk with slight stretch.  Machine washes and dries great.  Runs true to size.  Comfortable under jeans and sweaters without bulk.
B00D97K2OK|5|If you have a nice butt, it will be obvious with this skirt.
B00DX6VJ4Y|5|awesome
B00EECT60A|5|The jeans fit so perfectly and are extremely comfortable - Love them with the shirts on outside.<br />No bulges or ridges.  I have two pairs now<br />Hold their shape for the most part - do stretch out a bit after washings, but still think they are the best fitting jean<br />I have worn.
B00H96DZY6|1|The ONE pair of shorts I received was GREAT! Sadly this is the end of the positive comments for this review.<br />The negative comments are directed to Amazon and their lack of communication and care for customers.<br />After part of my order (5 pairs of shorts out of six) had not arrived days late, I had to contact Amazon to see what the issue was.<br />If I had not taken the time to initiate this contact, I would still be waiting on the delivery of my item.<br />The shorts were now showing unavailable even though when I purchased them the listing showed them as available.<br />Amazon was more than happy to charge my card, but then didn't have the time or courtesy to update me on the purchase and<br />let me know that the items had mysteriously become unavailable.<br />Shame on Amazon for taking orders that they couldn't fulfill, charging my card before the items were delivered and for not providing customer support regarding the status of items that were purchased.<br />Simply BAD BUSINESS!!!!!
B00G5NR6A8|4|As you would expect from FP!
B001JBNDLM|5|A perfect fit, comfortable and durable, this is a fine product. It is also very affordable. For the man who likes basic basics, this is an excellent purchase.
B00KRYPMKC|5|i wear a med and ordered a med. the fit is great but if you like your hoodies a little longer than this probably isn't the jacket for you. i think it looks cute and girly. i got black and red.
B003GIS9A6|5|Have been looking for pants that look good with cowboy boots.  These are perfect!  Have a pair of flat front Wrangler Riattas, but they only come in 2 colors.  These are dressy enough to wear with a jacket if needed as well.  Bought 3 colors and love all 3 pair!
B00FRDTU38|5|I love this hoodie, and it arrived over a month before it was promised. The sizing information is correct. I wear a U.S. medium, so I ordered and XL and it is a perfect fit. It's comfy and stylish. Might order in the other colors.
B00JDUH330|5|I got this for my Bf's bday. He's very tall, so I wish this were longer for him. Great shirt though. All sp fans notice and start to impersonate the City Wok guy.
B00JQWDTBA|5|Very, very comfortable.  I wear these all the time...they look good with jeans for work...good, heavyweight cotton.  I will be ordering more of these.  The dri-fit ones are even better...I'll be getting more of those too as they are the same material as used in the US Army PT shirt.
B00E4H88KE|5|Bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it😄😄. She wears it all the time. Will definitely buy another one.
B00IJINHTQ|3|Cute colors, but pretty small. My 6 week old already can't wear them. I'm disappointed because I love them otherwise.
B00K72K5JW|2|This is the third O&#34;Neill T-shirt I own, all of them sized medium. This one is mis-sized: way too small. Very difficult to get on and even harder to take off. In other words, it's unwearable. Any suggestions?
B008AEEG8U|5|Love this top! True to size. Nice quality. Will order another!
B00R51LHGI|5|Product arrived timely and as described.
B00VFTXU2U|4|Great color, but a little tight.  That doesn't bother all that much because I bought these tanks as layering items.  But if you wear it alone I suggest going up a size, unless you want to show everyone your upper half.  They are somewhat see through...
B009AWAOQ4|3|Too small
B00NRHF9M2|5|Very comfortable would again!
B00Z0FB22U|5|ordered 2x, normally wear 2-3x.  could possibly wear a 1x as there is ample room to wrap in front. just what I was wanting and getting ready to order more colors.  hope it washes well.  It does......I absolutely love these vests and just ordered my 4th color I think.  very comfortable and I like the coverage.
B00GT94FRU|5|Compliments on this scarf every time i wear it. The edges aren't finished very well, but it's very pretty.
B00SWV37DQ|5|my wife is a petite woman and so it fits her perfectly
B00VJK3NKE|4|I love these comfortable, slightly smoothing undies.  I wear skimmies all the time now.  The legs on the short length do ride up a bit through out the day.  Other than that, no complaints.
B00LC0IRYI|2|Was bought for my wife, but fits my 9 year old daughter. Unfortunately this is the second time for this, even ordering extremely large. I will not be using this manufacturer again.<br />I give 2 stars because my daughter will be able to wear it, if only for a few months.
B00JE7289Q|5|AMAZINGGGG fit and super sexy. really well made, sturdy and high quality. the busks are sewen in really well and the whole thing is super hot. comes with garter clips too! the one thing i didnt like is the string to tie it int he back; its a shiny nylon 'shoelace' type of string, but that can be replaced easily with leather cording or something else. i want one in everyyyy colorrrr!
B007YD5HMC|5|This cover up is absolutely gorgeous!!!!  I am a size 10 and this fits me perfectly!  I am a short woman, only 5 feet tall, and this comes to about my mid thigh, maybe a little longer.  The colors are really vibrant and I am so excited to wear this to the beach!
B006Z8I4CM|5|Good
B00HS1SEMU|5|These are exactly what I expected; so I ordered another package.
B009WS5S6C|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. It is lightweight but puffy. Comparable to scarves I have seen at the mall for a much higher price. It is the perfect accessory for any outfit!
B00JNWMU4K|4|Great!
B008H81ABU|5|A+
B00J0VCU26|2|A lot of cranky reviews about these socks, but they seem thick, soft, and high quality to me.<br /><br />Above words written prior to realizing that the socks shed black lint constantly, and develop holes in the heels way too soon. Won't buy again.
B00HVOQMLE|5|Buy this, you won't regret it. For size, just buy your usual, if your are a small buy the small size. I tested the ear buds and they work, don't know yet how they will hold up with the washing. I intend to just dry clean with dryel but haven't done that yet.
B00EK5NKGW|5|feels great, washes great. nice weathered look to it.
B00JH1HLGY|5|This robe is heavyweight and warm.  Even though it is slightly larger than I would have expected, I am completely satisfied with my purchase
B000UJY3W2|4|I purchased these to work out in, but they are bigger than expected around my leg and fall down.  I would have to order a smaller version.
B005PUZIQQ|5|I love this! I was nervous about choosing a size after reading all the reviews, but after carefully reading the size chart, I decided to go with the medium. After adjusting the lace, it fits perfectly. Okay, so it would fit absolutely perfect if I was about an inch taller. I'm somewhat short, and have a short waist (short torso), so the nonadjustable skirt portion hits my lower hip, which is wider than the upper/natural hip, where it's supposed to sit. So, because of this, it feels like the skirt is just a tad too \\"small.\\" But I digress. Anyway, the medium is great, and I think the sizing is pretty accurate. In general, I think corsets tend to fit better on hourglass shapes. To give some perspective, I'm about 5'2\\"-5'3\\", and measurements are approximately 37-26-37. Even though I'm losing inches, I imagine that I'll still be able to wear this dress, since it's adjustable. Even if I gain inches, there is still plenty of room for the lace to be let out.  I would definitely recommend this dress.
B00L57XC3E|2|Fabric is nice but very poor quality cut of the pattern that makes the fitting weird.  I would not recommend but if you want to try, good luck..
B00LZK70F2|5|Wicked nice for the money
B00L9YM8C4|3|small, but gonna create some hot sexy situations
B00NMUOM18|2|WRONG SIZE SENT ! I WANTED SIZE MED. NOT LARGE
B00L5M9CV0|5|good enough for the price and you get two.
B000OYF49O|5|As someone who has a big head, I'm really glad this hat was more spacious. If you have a really small head I would still buy, as the straps are adjustable, but if you know you have a larger head, don't worry, this will definitely fit.
B00BW8US6U|5|Package came two days before expected date (excellent). This key case is well made and I already got compliments on it. You can really smell the leather knowing that it is made with good quality .I could not find a key case like this in any stores, Glad I came across this one. It would be hard to find a better one, I been searching three months,
B0064QE1DQ|3|Nice hat.<br /><br />Because hat sizes are not precise, and fit a range of head circumferences, unless your head is of the largest dimensions that size will fit, the hat will be a little large.<br /><br />There are three things that would improve this hat:<br />1- some sort of decorative feather for the hat band (this hat had none).<br />2- more precision in shaping the creases/dents (these days it's hard to find a hat with good symmetry - most are lop-sided to some degree, and this one is slightly so)<br />3- a more appropriate brim shape for a Fedora: slightly turned down in front and back (look at photos of Sam Spade - this hat's brim is turned up all around).<br /><br />All in all, though, this is the best I've found, so far. It has the right brim and crown dimensions, at the very least. So it's a keeper. But, I'll continue looking for that perfect Fedora.
B00J5H8TDO|4|These are cute and very well made. I love the length. I'm a size 8 (medium) in most things, but I ordered a large in these. They are still slightly tight. (I wish they were loose as shown on that thin girl in the photo.) I would recommend these and I might even buy another pair.
B00AQKA8YC|5|I recommend these to all my fellow mothers for their little ones.  The material is very soft and it's perfect for hot summer climates.
B00245KA72|5|Fit great
B00IHL157G|1|Way too big
B00G9PW1D4|5|Beautiful dress...so comfortable. Love the materials and design.
B00COTJ6QE|5|This cover is a little on the small side, but is stretchy enough to fit comfortably.  I do recommend getting a size bigger than your normal size.  It looks just like the picture shows, you won't be disappointed!
B00STZEKM2|3|Belt started to fray after second use.
B009AWNZCE|2|Material felt great, but by too small I mean really short. The model must have been 5 feet tall - I'm 5'8&#34; and it didn't make it to my belly button. Gave it to charity.
B008STPH5S|5|I got this dress today - packaged perfectly for fast delivery and lowest shipping rate.  I rinsed it in cold water and hung it on the line to dry - nice breeze today and dress was dry in minutes.<br /><br />It is a bit too large for me - and I'm about a 16 - but it hangs well, not droopy. I'm about 5' 3&#34; and it is just a tad long, not dragging but on the edge.<br /><br />It is so beautiful - the colors are awesome.  Dress is perfect weight for winter time and spring, which is finally here.  I'm not sure that it might be a bit heavy for summer, but should be nice in the evenings or for wearing after the pool / hot tub sessions.<br /><br />I will probably order a couple more of these - they are so comfortable.
B00EZHVN2I|3|Errr...it's not canary yellow like in the photo. We needed a yellow accessory for a yellow-themed wedding and this wasn't exactly what I expected. This is more like yellow orange than canary yellow. In fact, the scarf is the exact same color as the Amazon stars and the submit button on this review. Luckily, we're just the guests so we can pretend to be a little color blind if the bride thinks we're way off her color theme.
B000851IAS|5|This item was ordered as a birthday gift and shipped directly to a family member. The family member was very pleased with the fit, color, and quality of the shirt. I was happy to discover the item had arrived so quickly and in perfect condition. I would definitely order from this company again.
B008YWF85S|5|Look nice and are comfortable-from what I'm told...these were a gift.
B00P0NFAQ6|5|👍👍👍 Thumbs Up all the way. Really like the backpack...has plenty of storage and room. Got here really quick too
B0038R94EK|1|For the price this wasn't worth it. The coins were way too small, didn't make much of a statement.
B00BBPVLWE|5|I just received this sweater tonight, and I already love it! The style is very cute and flattering, and the material feels nice and seems to be good quality. Definitely recommend.
B008J1OBCA|4|Looks so cute on my baby. The stiching is brown, could not really tell from the photo. But still a very cute headband to addition to our headband collection.
B0014BL2M4|5|bought this for my dad we are going to a party in two weeks. thanks for having.
B00T4XN24K|5|My 10 year old loved it!
B00EO8Y1W2|3|Cute suit, but runs a bit small on the bottom!
B00M3O7WQG|3|I like the way these fit on my butt, it definitely made me &#34;a bettabutt.&#34; However, they were EXTREMELY tight on my legs. I will be returning them, but they were nice pants. Will probably just order a size up.
B00H2BYBPA|5|Foxcroft shirts fit well, wash well, and come out of the dryer looking like they've been ironed.
B00AO2R8K4|5|I have been trying to get something like this for my 3 year old daughter. She love it a lot.
B00QLDQ3BU|5|Great towel for the gym. I love it and it's a great color, soft, absorbent material and is as featured.
B00P8F04AI|5|One of the warmest and most comfortable coats I have warn.  I am an athletic 6'1, 195ibs and large fits me perfectly.  Would recommend to anyone and will probably get a second one in black when I am ready to replace my Carhartt.
B000GY4L0A|3|The hat itself is fine, but needed something ornamental on it.  I researched what goes on bicorn and tricorn hats from the colonial period and discovered cockades.  Since it didn't come with one, I made one.
B00WO84JQM|1|Not sure if this is for kids, but i didnt see that in the review.
B003H05TEC|5|I love these socks they fit well and washes great.  Will order again from this supplier,
B00DV8SA0K|5|I love Bolero sweaters.  This was really nice with a cute little puffed sleeve.  Fit great too.  I have others with longer sleeves so this is nice for the warmer weather.
B00B2H940M|4|I bought this for my daughter since during STAR testing, her class is required to &#34;Dress for Success&#34;! If the feel successful, they will be successful. She can also use the dress at a party or at church.
B00G85K1LO|5|Look and fit great.
B00CMNXDSY|5|Just received and going down a size based on reviews was perfect.  I'm 5'8 165lbs and wear a medium in almost anything but this small is a great fit.  Its like a medium slimish fit, great arm and overall torso length.  This being a light weight thin down will be my go too midlayer for AT fall hikes and also packs into the pocket like a charm (super compact A+).  Seems pretty durable but will update to see how it holds up through a few backpacking trips. For the price I highly recommend this product, I don't see much quality difference from the high end brands.
B00Q43IHB6|3|Nice material.
B00AEMBAY4|5|We love Zutano and this is adorable, reversible and a little on the heavy/thick side.  It goes with a lot in my daughter's wardrobe.
B00U5HKQMU|5|It was perfect and was a great way to tell out family that we are expecting!
B00LU1XXHA|5|Love them for my son
B00K5XONGO|5|Excellent
B0096NI7YS|5|This is a very nice peplum dress from AGB.  The dress is well made and fits very well.  I like the style and the way it fits my body, laying perfectly on my curves.  The peplum waist gives the dress a very nice accent.  The sizing is true to size.  This dress is very comfortable to wear moving with, not restricting your movements.  I love the above the knee length which is what I prefer.<br /><br />As an Amazon Prime member I received free two day shipping on this dress.  My dress arrived on time in perfect shape.
B00KIF3DT2|1|Extremely small for a 5/6. My daughter actually wears a size 4 and I thought I was buying big for her to grow into. The coat is so small that it barely covers her arm length and just barely zippers shut. The hood is so small it doesn't even cover half of her head . I was very disappointed in this purchase and will need to return.
B005C51156|5|The shirt is great.  I am a little hesitant purchasing clothing online but the size is perfect, and the shirt is really comfortable.
B008MI5B9M|5|Nice costume
B00DSSG5BE|5|This dress is attractive and I received many compliments when I wore it to casual summer parties.  It covers figure flaws but doesn't look like a tent; very comfortable and stylish.
B00DSYBR16|5|This fits perfectly as it should and it looks great, one of my favorite pieces of clothing. The only downside for me is no front pockets which I'm so used to having on outerwear. However, I believe it gives the piece more class this way. I wear it to work in a professional environment when it's cold and don't feel out of place.
B00G9DCOTW|5|excellent
B0002T6ABW|5|These gloves are awesome! I have larger hands/knuckles and they fit. The leather is thin though but the design is perfect for what I was looking for.
B00GUDDBUM|5|I have gotten two others of this shirt I like the sizing the fit is good and the colors are perfect for what I need and like.
B00IS9IAXY|1|comfy and fits
B00AU3S34M|5|but really nice I love them im glad they are a little big for her so she can get a few wear
B00L0GDJJ2|3|It's more of a bubble gum or Pepto pink which is disappointing.
B008YEA7RA|3|G-Star run small. I usually take a large but I bought an XL in this. It is still very tight. I will need to do a lot of push-ups to get rid of my beer-belly before wearing this in public. Ok quality, just tight.
B00CPKUDOQ|5|I love these leggings ! So comfortable and<br />Just perfect! I have a brown pair as well!<br />Wish I could afford them in more colors!<br />You won't be disappointed.
B00M0JOUAK|1|Cheap -- one day of use and the leather is coming off!
B00B70GLAK|5|It's good.
B00EVW4OU0|4|very cute yet elegant 😎
B0096GO2BM|5|Great wallet.  A little pricey, but I guess thats what wallets are costing these days.  I would recomend this to others
B0057ML1ZO|5|Great shirt. Great colors. Good construction. Doesn't shrink, fade, or look cheap or delicate like many shirts at this cost. I blotched paint on mine accidentally and am coming back for a second. I'm glad they are available again.
B00F9HQ882|5|It is great
B0043RHZP4|5|I bought this for my daughter and her friend. They love the shirt and it appears to be a good quality.
B000K2P2W4|4|The cover is nice I would recomend it to everyone. It makes handling easy, more grip. Don't like the clip not matching ( its white ). but on the bright side its easyer to see.
B00CD9SZEY|3|I did order one size larger and it fits fine, but I think my original size may have been just fine also. The belt is pretty much useless, will be sewing it on to the shorts to keep in place.  It is very cute, the quality is OK.  The top is pretty stretchy.
B00TTR7C8I|5|Very comfortable and stylish!
B003NX8D0U|5|Loved everything about the jacket.
B00OI1Y54O|5|Purchased as a gift, I bought one and was so pleased, purchased a second for another diminutive relative. Quality construction is evident in this very cute lightweight flannel nightgown. The garment is sized correctly -- not too small or too large. The stitching is done skillfully with no loose stitches or hanging threads. The lace and ribbon accent on the bodice is a perfect accent. I paired the nightgown with this robe [[ASIN:B00O4GZUZG Hello Kitty Pink Plush Robe for girls]] and they look great together.
B00DXFXTX4|5|Longest anything like that ever stayed on her
B00MTFKZ2C|3|Cute, but arms were too short.
B00L4IP1F6|4|fits perfect and looks great, worth the price
B00O8RTZWA|5|Very cute
B00F37RI78|5|:)
B00CQ3DRAO|5|This skirt was true to size, I am five weeks postpartum, 5'9&#34; and 195lbs. It is a light weight material that has a good amount of elasticity, so it stretches a fair amount. The length is great. I think I will get a lot of use out of it for spring, summer, and fall.
B005442A0K|5|I like the fit better than a stocking cap.  The brim is priceless.
B008MA2332|5|Wow, very impressed wroth the fit ammendment fabric. Very well made.
B0042D2GL2|4|Smells a little weird. Strong chemicals i assume, but it fits as expected (I'm 5'11&#34;, 190lbs and ordered a large). Looks good. Needed a cheap shirt for a groom who wants his groomsmen to wear super hero outfits under our tuxes. Probably wont wear it around town.
B00FYF9M0A|5|I love it! Very soft and good quality material ! Fit as expected !
B00H5MVNBQ|5|These are my favorite baby PJs yet!! I have tried every type of baby PJ style available and this is definitely my favorite! It's like PJs and a blanket sleeper in one. I just wish they made them in bigger sizes-- my son has already grown out of it :(
B002QDFSJC|5|I love it and have wore the accessory several times. A good price for the three piece combo. All items received in good shape..
B00BI1W0OO|3|The bib part fits but the hat is too small.
B00PRA2X1M|5|Very comfortable not to big or small even after u wash them
B000CH4E8A|4|Warm shirt, great all-over fit, not baggy like most shirts.
B00801Q5OQ|5|My husband always wears this shirt to the airport for flights. He sails through security and never gets chosen for \\"random\\" inspections.
B000ZMX5KU|5|I won best dressed at a murder mystery with this costume so I highly recommend it. The only extra note as a previous reviewer stated is you may want to safety pin the gold cloak to make it look more authentic-- as he said, make it more &#34;flowy&#34;. Add one of those fat-belly inserts you will make the perfect overweight Aladdin at your next party.
B00DP7AYMY|3|There must be new sizing or something because since I was ordering over the internet, I even bought a size larger than I would normally wear and there was no way these shorts were going to fit.
B005CSP082|2|I measured the hoodie, it's NOT true-to-size. at least 2 size bigger. I bought size large, but it actually is XL or XXL. the quality is ok for  its price. don't like it
B003FP39XW|4|Fabric is nice for a cheap clown costume, but the size is really wonky. I bought the 'Adult Plus' size and ended up with Fat Albert's pajamas.<br /><br />Don't know about the other size(s), but the Adult Plus fits 4-5x.
B000YQJD3U|5|This is by far my favorite bra.  When I put it on, I swear a light came on from above and angels sang.  It's taken me through nursing two of my babies, and you know what?  Even though I'm a 36C, I have every intention of continuing to wear these bras well past my breastfeeding years.  I LOVE that it doesn't have a wire, and the fabric is stretchy and not-stretchy in just the right places to give really good support.  I'll put it on and try to lift the girls up higher with my hands, but this bra holds them exactly where they're supposed to be.  The fabric also breathes well during the hot summer months.  It's just like a good friend: uplifting, supportive, and keeps you cool under pressure.
B00DU4X8Q6|1|Fits small go up 2 sizes
B00UZAEGLO|4|my granddaughter loves them, they fit well
B00PFLOXCK|5|I bought this for a poison ivy costume and it fit great and looked even better! I got a lot of compliments on it.
B0038LM0YM|5|Pros<br />+ The cotton and fabric is significantly higher quality than competitors<br />+ Great fit<br />+ Very soft and durable<br />+ Collar doesn't stretch out<br />+ Stays tucked in<br /><br />Cons<br />+ Price.<br /><br />These are the only undershirts I will wear. Although somewhat more expensive than other brands, certainly worth the price and the 6 pack is a good value. Unlike other brands Jockey t-shirts last for years, fit great and are very soft.The collar doesn't stretch out and keeps it's shape. Also, they are a slightly longer than comparable t-shirts which means they stay tucked in without readjusting.
B007BHXBYM|5|I rarely leave reviews however I am very happy with this product!  The material is very nice and not at all cheap. The sizing is spot on (I'm 5'7\\" about 200lbs., size 16 and got XL) and the fabric is very flattering.  The item shipped very fast and came nicely sealed in individual ziplock bags.  And the clothes didn't have the weird chemical smell some internet order clothes have.  I ordered several tops from this seller and just ordered more now that I have seen them in person.  Highly recommended!
B00IXJFB6I|5|Great value for the money. It fits just like my thyme maternity bra.
B008DSMSOC|5|Super cute and fit perfectly!
B00P9KKJO8|2|Sizing was quite small. Ordered a 2XL and it was almost snug on someone that is usually an XL. Also pretty light weight...
B001OGPPZY|5|I bought this suit to make a Halloween costume for my boyfriend and was completely amazed when I received it.  It was of exceptional quality.  I actually felt bad making all the changes to it.  The lining was satin and well done.  The shoulders nicely padded.  My boyfriend is 6' and 175 pounds and an athletic cut.  He normally wears a 42 regular which is what I ordered and the suit fit him perfectly.  I needed to hem it up which wasn't a big deal. (It comes unhemmed). It has a polyester blend to it which doesn't wrinkle easily.  I am particular about clothing and I think that if you wanted a white suit for a wedding, this would easily work.
B005GG1IH2|5|Great tie, love the contrast colors. America Pride!!! Fast delivery. Thanks much.
B00JDZ8DQQ|1|I cancelled
B0007YR9R6|5|Love this bra
B009LEFPSS|1|This is not a dress especially a plus size dress!!! Fits great as a skirt!!
B005P6LVV6|5|I purchased this a few years ago to have at work and add flavored drink pouches to as it holds .5 liters which many of those require.  I've since used it on many hunting trips and found the clip attachment extremely useful when in a treestand or hanging off a D ring on my belt when walking.  I also have the 25oz version but like the compactness and ease of carrying this one anywhere and everywhere.  The bottom is contoured so it fits easily into any cupholder unlike the larger Camelbak bottles as well.  I'll be buying more of this size in the future.
B00AAWVQYW|4|Decent quality, worth the price.  Tends to run slightly small, but workable.  I needed a suit for my son's First Holy Communion, and had a lot of trouble finding one that fit.  We need to have a few alterations done, but this was the only suit that came close to fitting him right.
B00ACIFZ1Y|4|These are nice but are on the thin side.
B00I152QMQ|2|I really like these gloves except for the fact that I wore them for less than an hour, and the knitting at the thumb became undone. Now I'll either buy a new pair from somewhere else or have to get it fixed up.
B00DGM59ZU|5|These were a gift for a new mother friend of ours and they were a big hit. Glad to have purchased this from here. Excellent price, super fast shipping, and well worth the time to buy.
B001A3Y7E6|5|This is a wonderful sock for anyone looking for warmth, comfort and a soft touch to their toes. I had toe surgery a couple months ago and was stuck in the ortho healing boot for 6 weeks. Then the temps dropped and I was stuck scrambling for warm socks to cover my foot with. This was the best one I purchased out of all the other Wigwam socks bought. They kept me warm, they're not too big to be worn with normal sized boots and they're soft. Perfection.
B00EK93Q5I|3|It's exactly like the image is just not as loose fitting. It's actually quite tight
B001R4CA24|2|I didn't expect socks with such a high percentage of cotton to \\"plush\\" so easily. My son has worn them only a couple of times and they look like he's been wearing them forever.<br />However, he likes the fact that they're thick and comfortable.
B008AKN2TI|4|I have used this type of undershirt for many years.
B00B3WCV74|5|I love it is a true xl, some xl fit great until you reach the bottom of the shirt.  I was very impressed with the quality and true to size!
B0060JJO20|4|It did what it needed to but it didn't look great on me. It was a little baggy, especially around the sleeves.
B00C9HBVZ0|4|I liked them but they didn't like me, They seemed to be a good quality , just didn't fit.
B00C6U9MTM|4|Love the costume. Is tight-fitting but should be okay for the one night.
B0050AFYQ0|1|I have been buying FOTL boxer briefs for well over 10 years, but the last packs I purchased are redesigned in a terrible way.  The fabric is thinner, I noticed it the second I took it out of the package, and the elastic is completely different and has what seems like 30-40% of the strength of the previous elastic. FOTL has screwed its customers by changing production to a vastly inferior product.  I will be returning my two unopened packs, and will probably end up tossing the new pairs I opened and washed, because the elastic simply does not perform its function.  FOTL may have saved a few cents making these new boxer briefs, but they have lost a lifetime customer as a result.  I can't imagine I will be the only one.<br />Unfortunately, anyone who buys these regularly will not read the reviews on the redesign until after they experience this product failure for themselves.
B007MLVL9E|5|Very cute pants.  Fit nicely on my 18 month old toddler.  Wash well in cold and medium heat in the dryer.  Haven't faded yet.
B00DSK7XVI|5|Love these PJs!!!  They are warm, soft and cuddly, without being too hot.  They are cut  amply enough to be comfortable.
B00LWAOBR0|5|Very warm hat.
B00QD8IP46|5|short
B004WPHVD8|5|Was perfect for the show and fit as expected. That's all I have to say. I don't respond all the time
B0016D19N2|4|I use this as a pajama bra if that makes sense.  I like to get into pajamas after work but there is still hours before bed and I don't feel comfortable walking around without a bra.  This works pretty good.  Due to the design it lessens uni-boob and is comfortable.
B00JOLXMAG|5|Great item fast shipping
B010NNDL04|5|Love it fits Great
B00SUP3ZHC|4|The shirt is good quality as well as the print. The only problem is it doesn't fit - by a lot. I'm 6'2&#34; /160lbs, ordered XL but the shirt's length is ~M or a small L but its width is huge. I imagine all shirts are the same length but just differ in width. Beware if you're taller than 5'9&#34;
B00CONNILE|4|It is good product but the size is way off.
B00D3REUGC|5|My son fits perfectly into a normal 2T. After reading the reviews, I purchased the pajamas in a 4T. After washing, they fit perfectly with a little room to spare. The quality is good and the price is very good. I bought 4 different pairs, one is a bit smaller then the others, but still fits him fine. These are nice and light weight for the Fall. I'm happy with my purchase!
B00L3NWF42|4|Super cute lion costume. Reading reviews I was hesitant to order but everyone loved the costume. The fur isn't the best but you can comb it out and fluff it up.
B0010KXA4W|2|Very thin and cheaply made.
B00LO1V57G|5|Soft fabric, nice quality. Would buy original penguin again.
B00F2ZCQ28|1|If you just want to extend your bra a tiny bit (for when you are bloated or to break in a new bra), then don't get these. The space between the hooks is a couple of inches and the elastic is super stretchy, so it adds an extra 2-3 inches to your bra and no less than that. Sometimes a brand new bra is just little too tight when it is new so I only wanted to add a little space to make the bra a little more comfortable while it is being broken in, without changing the fit of the bra. Sizing up in the bra band would not work because although the band would fit better at first, it would be too big when it is broken in. Plus, the cup and strap placement is different on a larger band size. But this adds much more space than I need and my bra is way too loose, even on the tightest setting. I can't imagine anybody needing to add inches to their bra band. If your band is several inches too small, then the cups, wires, and straps are going to be wrong on your body and a bra extender won't help with that. However, these might be good for pregnancy when you are constantly changing and don't want to invest in a new bra that won't fit for very long, but I can't say that for sure, because chances are the cups on your bra would also the too small and you might be better off investing in a nursing bra that will fit as you grow and shrink.    I ordered some Maidenform bra extenders that don't have the long elastic piece, so hopefully I'll have better luck with those.    UPDATE: The Maidenform ones are so much better. The fit is better and they don't stretch, so they stay in place for the perfect fitting and comfortable bra. Wow! I also noticed they were easier to clip and felt softer on my skin than these ones.
B006TC6NQ8|5|My husband has never worn &#34;Polo&#34; shirts. He always wears long sleeve shirts which he rolls up to his elbows, I mentioned &#34;Polo&#34; shirts to him one day and he wanted to try one. The only shirts I buy him are Carhartts, found the &#34;polo&#34; shirts and ordered him one. Now he has several.
B00GFQXHDA|4|I got this outfit for my Grand Daughters valentine's celebration.  It is a very cute dress set & I'm hoping they'll wear it regardless of the day of the year.<br />It fits good and seemed to be well made.
B00TFW18GE|4|Was too small for me but its ok i just gave it to my sister
B00U2B4TTK|5|such a cute suit for my daughter.  Fits well & we didn't have the top pulling up frequently
B00GLQC9D8|3|The shirt fit me, but it's not loose like it appears on the model. That may be because I have a larger chest and hips, but I followed the size chart and I expected it to be slightly more loose instead of being fitted.
B00ECL1Q3I|5|Given as a gift and was very well received!
B00L0UUJU0|5|I love my dress
B005OFM2L6|4|These boxers are really thick. They're almost shorts. I can't wear these underneath most of my dress slacks, but they are very comfortable, so I just save them for the weekends when I'm wearing jeans.
B00JBEU9KW|5|Love these underwear!  Make sure you check the size chart as they are not US standard sizes.  The feel is great and comfortable all day.  I plan to pick up more as space allows.
B002C74BX6|5|Puma Forever!!!!!!! Perfect Tee fot my 3 years old son. Look is fantastic!!! Very comfortable and what is important PURE COTTON!don`t change the shape after washing!
B00IITMBGG|1|In my opinion, this is a cheap quality purse, dislike it very much!  Would not recommend!
B00I0N14AO|5|I'm heading to Australia and I wanted some board shorts since I'll be at the beach a lot. I work with young children so it's nice to be able to cover up a little more and not have them pulling at a bikini bottom. These are the perfect length for me (5'2&#34;), look great on (wet or dry), and were really comfortable in the pool. The design is fashionable, and with the neutral colors, it can work with almost any color swimwear, which is a huge plus. Definitely a good investment!
B00C4XUQOQ|4|The billfold that this one replaced was the same type but by a different manufacturer who no longer made them. I was very happy to find this one and so far it meets my expectations. Only issue so far is that the leather can stick to the top credit card requiring you to slide your finger between the card and the leather to release it.  I believe that this issue will go away after time so I can live with it for now. It is also a little smaller then expected. I prefer the way it folds up which prevents anything from falling out by mistake.
B003VZMX5G|5|Nice hat for the price.  Fit's a little big to your size, but that's better than small.  I was able to adjust it by adding velcro to the inside of the headband.  I liked it enough to buy another one in a different color.
B000F2236M|5|Luxurious feeling.  Drapes beautifully.
B009F7FDO2|5|i have always bought quiksilver stuff from SG and even in Manila in Surf shops, this one is authentic but i can guess it is cheaply made. b/c i got a quiksilver jacket in HK (a replica) and the texture of the cloth is exactly the same, do not machine wash please. just hand wash. i think washing macchine will rip it off. but yes i love it still.
B009NRBXUM|5|These are quality Hats that are very cool
B00DGVG17G|4|I love this watch
B00KF3C9GU|5|LOVES THEM!
B004AK3SMI|4|Fits well, nice quality, soft fabric!
B007T27MCQ|4|This is a nice set of board shorts that fit well, look good, dry quickly, and are just good all around.
B001UE74CM|1|Was pretty small and seemed dissapointed when I received it, really was not suitable or big enough for a mans wallet
B000UASMUU|5|Surprisingly I couldn't find any strapless bras in the stores that were padded.  I am small and wanted the push up and the added cleavage.  This bra did the trick for me.  It stays in place, is very comfortable and gave me the look I wanted.  I would recommend for anyone a B or smaller, Might be an issue to get it to stay up if you have large heavy breasts.
B005N28700|5|Awesome
B00GQ7IQPC|2|I guess there's truth in advertising here.  This thing is ugly, but not ironic ugly.  It's more piece of crap ugly.  It's like someone spent ten minutes looking through crappy Christmas clip art ugly.  The point is, crap is sort of the theme here, including the lights, which were actually the saving grace until they stopped working about two hours in.  By the end of the night, there were little wires dangling out, each tipped with a festive little unlit led bulb.  I think I'll return it.
B00LJOOH5A|4|Nice fit with comfortable support.
B00QA6NBDG|5|I'm 5'2 105 lbs, and have a 32a bust. The small was perfect!! I love this. Finally a bikini looks good on me and not awkward because of my small chest and athletic legs!  The bottoms are so cute and I could definitely wear the top as a shirt.
B00ADX36LY|5|perfect and just right for tight. as a man im sure to have women looking at my butt rather than my face.
B0042LGEY4|5|Bought to use as part of a Girl Scout Junior Girl Uniform - worked perfectly.  Great value for the money.
B007ZZQWVY|4|I love that it doesn't look like a diaper, but rather like a swim trunk! It absorbs well and withstands the washer machine great, just get AT LEAST a size bigger, especially if you have a baby on the higher percentile for weight!
B00C5TOHIA|5|Again this is a nice dress I love this color and it fits perfect  and it's very comfortable  nice nice
B00JAWHX54|3|The severity of the cloth is very excellent and fairly small sizes. Thank you very pleasure to deal with you
B008KY8014|4|It was a good way to dress up and still wear skinny jeans. It was for my grand daughter and she liked it.
B00GPG5W5Q|5|These collar stays and magnets keep the collar tips absolutely glued in place. Before purchasing this set, I've never used magnetic stays, but after using these, I'll never go without them again. My collars have never looked so crisp! The three sizes should fit most any dress shirt you're likely to own and the magnets are strong.<br /><br />About the only issue I can think of is, the magnets can break if they're allowed to &#34;stick&#34; together too fast. I don't consider this a flaw, just a reminder to be careful when handling them.
B0013525X6|5|i must say it came faster then anything i have order on this site .....but i would buy another color but i think i will go one more size up beacaues im big up top but think god i know how to use sewing manchine and all left enought for me to fix ...i did not have enought time to send it back because it is my bestfriend wedding or i would have sent it back and got bigger size ...but other then that i love it and i will be ordering another .....
B00BBKGLDI|5|My husband loves these tees so much I bought him 10 of them. They are super, super soft and there are no seams in the torso area. The sleeves are short enough so they don't hang out under the sleeves of short sleeve shirts and the torso is long enough to tuck in easily (he's 6'5&#34;). This was a problem on other tees for tall guys; the torso would be long enough but the tee sleeves were too long and hung out under short sleeves. These shirts wash and dry really well; they stay soft after washing. Compared to the cost of some other high end tees, we think these are an excellent value as well as the best tee around.
B00M9H2KOG|5|Simply put....it's a good quality belt that looks nice.  It runs long.....so be sure to order a size SMALLER than you normally wear.  You'll be glad you did.
B00KJBAPGO|5|lovely
B009AFLI66|4|Love these gloves!  My only complaints are that the fingers are too big around...my fingers aren't that fat!  And there is no drawstring at the wrist to tighten.
B011EX7H20|5|I got this in a 3x and it fit perfectly! Being a sort of fitted dress, I didn't expect it to be as flattering as it is! It's a nice breathable summer dress and it hits right at the knee. I'm a size 16/18 U.S., 5'8 and have a large chest, and I love how this dress hides my problem areas. The pattern on it is printed perfectly and holds up through washing and drying with no shrinking. Such a cute dress for such a cheap price!
B00SDTNQ8S|5|The shirt arrived on time and was overall what I expected. I'm a busty girl so I ordered the XXL and it fit as I expected. It does fit a little tight but still comfortably especially in the sleeves. Overall I like the shirt and expect to wear it throughout the year instead of just on St. Patty's Day. I'm glad I purchased this shirt.
B00KNIAUWC|4|Doublju Women 3/4 Sleeve scoop neck line Henley.  I ordered this in a small for my daughter who is 32&#34; chest.  It was a little too small - tight around the body and too tight under the arms.  Cotton quality is not bad, a little thin but not see through.
B00H7VDI6S|5|Good
B003B2XEQ6|5|I purchased these pants because I already owned them in black and lighter grey. I really like these pants. They have a smooth and silky texture to them, and they have the look and feel of high quality. Because of the price I was nervous that they might be cheaply made (like an off brand you might find at a department store), but to my delight they are of superior quality.<br /><br />They come with a sharp crease and are ready to wear out of the box. No regrets in buying this. I will probably eventually replace most of my pants with this one in various colors. I highly recommend these.
B006SCSV1E|5|nice shirt.....nice fit...would recomend...very comfortable..and figure flattering...great for summer weather..jeans and capris...good quality..not for cooler temps unless layering...good feel to material
B008R6ZCDE|1|I ordered the tanks after verifying the sizes, but when it arrived, i realized they were of kid size. Too bad, will never order tanks from Amazon in future.
B00DVLI5UW|5|I ordered a size XL and it fit my wife really well, very nice materials and of course looks hot on her.
B004JWHJUY|3|I used to be able to find a sturdy King Size pair of cargo shorts, they'd lasted me for years (at least 5), and even the crotch stitching was very strong.  The tweed/twill stitch they used was far thicker yet still very comfortable, and they even had a metal button rather than the plastic one.  I've searched for a long time to find ones like my old pairs, and have ordered 2 or 3 more pairs yet I've never found them again.  These are very comfortable but I can tell the fabric used in these is just not to the same quality.  They seem well made, stitching seems accurate.  I just don't think they'll even last an entire summer.
B003XIXU3U|4|I was pleased with the protective gear.  It was a perfect fit. It also arrived as promised.  My son was very pleased.
B00IFRTG3C|5|I bought these two and also another two pack in different colors. These tops fit just like the photo, whoever is posting that the neck is too small must have very broad shoulders or a defective product? I am very happy with these, they go perfect with leggings and cover your rear. :-) happy with my purchase and want every color!
B00E5RHIFO|5|Pretty great shorts, fit perfect.
B003S0O76M|5|this hoodie comes at a great price and is seriously the comfiest sweater ever. So veratile and just plain cute! I want it in every single color
B001O9BEJ2|5|Perfectly made with wide waistband, super soft Egyptian cotton, excellent fit. The best on the market.
B00M31HFYI|3|These are thinner than I expected.  One sock has a hole on the back of the heel.  To tight at the band for larger feet.
B008DMCSKW|3|Nice styling
B003GE2AS2|3|I used it for about 2 days before I realized that the clip does not retain its shape as you take things in and out of it. Great idea with the quotes, but horrible material that won't stand the test of time to invest any money into it. You're bound to lose money with a clip that gets that loose.
B007UNA4MY|5|I bought this or my 15 year old step daughter for Halloween.  It fit her perfectly and was cute- not too revealing as some costumes are.
B00GGBRRB2|5|Love it
B00AQJTAME|5|We got the newborn, our son was 7 pounds 11 ounces.  He fit in these with a little wiggle room.  They were so cute!
B001LMX33C|5|My little granddaughter (and her mommy and daddy) love all the clothes that came in her birthday package!  Everything is made well and washes nicely!
B00OPA7LYY|5|Great
B00JF5NOK4|5|I am about 5'6 and weight about 150lbs. I'm definitely curvy in the right places. I've always struggled with having swim bottoms fit me right. I purchased a XL and it fits soooooo amazing. I LOVEEEEE this swim suit and the quality is perfect! The price is so reasonable!
B00712UMRG|5|Made a Hit wearing The Ascot!
B006CUBP60|5|I purchased its item for my son for Christmas. He is quite the clothes horse and very particular. It is very reasonably priced. Good quality reinforced seams. Very soft.
B00HALEMHO|5|i love the nigtmare b4 christmas mvie i collect items from the movie in the picture its blue with dark sleeves mine i got is all grey which i love it took awhile to get to me but its worth it thanks
B00EL8HWBC|3|Beautiful bathing suit, but the top area is made for woman with really small breast. fits middle area perfect makes the body curvy.
B00KHRHEZA|5|Very nice material and soft and comfortable for my 2 year old (he's a big boy so I got him a 4T). The hat is nice too he runs around in just his diaper and his hat LOL!
B00SOJY802|5|good quality.  I think the trick is to wear them inside out basically so that the seam doesn't show on the lace top when you flip it over.
B00AFBLK12|3|The shirt is fairly well made but because it is a junior large it is a slim fit. I took that chance because I liked the print on the front which is really cute. I probably will just hang to dry as to not have any shrinkage. Love those dark angels. :D
B0083E77DI|3|The item is made out of flexible material . It fits but the torso area is a bit short so it looks as if it's going to slip right off of my chest if is stand up too straight. Although i usually fit into a small because of being taller and having a longer upper half i know that next time i will buy the medium large size instead of the small medium.<br />The collar is also rather narrow around the neck but the cuffs are alright.
B00KYKCJ46|4|Small on my eight year old boy
B002AH997G|5|Washes well, no fading and logo stays perfect.
B00M1I49P6|3|It's a good jacket but, it doesn't look like the picture, it was a lilttle small but it fits fine over all it's made a good gift.
B00485BIKY|3|The fabric is very thin.  I needed a red t-shirt quickly and it was inexpensive.  I didn't expect much and I got what I paid for.
B00KJLFXXY|4|Pretty good, nice quality... not girlie.... I wear a 7 3/4 hat size(XL head) and they barely reach around to cover my ear completely but they do(barely) they are warm enough...<br />the actual color is not like the picture, they are more of a darker chocolate color(which i prefer)<br />although i would like them to stretch open a little further i can't really complain as my cranium is larger than average...
B009E6REGO|5|Just what I was looking for----very pleased!
B00DEMNTB8|5|I My son's likes the Fast and The Furious and Them type of car's. It Really was also a Great Price considering it has Fast and Furious on it.
B007MFDHKQ|4|It was as described. Fit perfect
B00JFQ8QKQ|3|The dark jeans are very dark. Close to black IMO.  Just a heads up
B0040X4YR8|2|This item was really cute but I just couldn't order it big enough!  I intially ordered an XL to be safe (I'm busty) and it wasn't even close!  So I looked at their size chart (on their website, not Amazon's) and decided to try the 2XL even though I am not nearly as big as the measurements listed.  Not even close.  I needed another 10 inches to get it around me!  The two sizes appear to be exactly the same.  There really isn't a difference.  I checked the tags and they clearly list the sizes, but when I'm a size 10 in women's clothes, why would I not be able to get into a 2XL?  Basically, if you're tiny, you'll have no problems. On a positive note, the returns were easy enough and their customer service is pretty responsive, though they couldn't really tell me why the sizing was so weird.
B0006M4L5W|5|I have used this product over a year now. I have found this front pocket wallet to be very durable. I carry a small amount of cash and cards. If one carries a lot of cards say 8 or 10 you may find this product a little crowded
B00D7SWED8|2|it does not look as big in person small hat does not make look like a tough security guard theres better hats
B000BTUURS|1|I bought 2 shirts in different colors and washed them on the cold cycle and they went from 3XL to Large.  These would have been nice shirts but now they don't fit.  I had Outer Banks brand in the past and did not have this issue.
B00CHOUAC0|4|They wear well.
B000G73MNE|5|This is the only pair of work shorts that I'll wear.  I've tried Dickies and some other brand and either they fit weird or the hammer loop was too big or not good sized pockets.  These are great and seem to be as durable as they could be.
B00MXM3J2Y|5|I have recently purchased about 5 belts and by far this is the best made for the money. Please don't by Dockers bekts they are absolutely the worst.
B002RMZ5Q8|3|I had size 38 and every part was ok except the chest and belly was loose so i decided to order 36 and this one still has loose chest and belly plus now my sleeves are passing my finger tips!!!!!!!!! i guess someone mounted the wrong sleeves size!!!
B00FIOKK1W|1|This is a ridiculous &#34;thing&#34; to purchase.<br />Avoid at any cost.
B004SHOCW8|5|I am very happy with this scarf.  It is quite soft and supple, and the color is more muted than the picture shows, which is what I was hoping for.  It looks very nice with my boiled wool jacket and it is nice and warm.  Thank you Scotland!
B00LO86PLA|5|my son loved these! great product and great price
B00CEL3BJU|5|Cool idea and actually pretty useful when cold and in the snow since it keeps your face warm if you dont already have a beard.
B004D2RMG6|5|This bra is very pretty and cute. The price is also quite reasonable as well. As a bustier woman, I find that there are not that many bras available that look cute in DD. I used to be a 38DD but I have been working out at the gym for months and now am a 36 D. I bought this in my old size before I realized all my older bras were getting baggy on top this is the only bra out of my older bras that still fits, so I would recommend buying in a bigger size than you normally would. The only drawback to this bra is that the middle of the bra where the underwires come together squeezes a little during the day, but I think it is worth a little discomfort for the cuteness of the bra.
B00UT6IRC8|1|XXL fit like a small, waste of money
B005R4ZLPS|5|This sweater is so comgy and I love it! I could've probably ordered 1 size smallerl, but it has exceeded my espectations & I would highly recommend this sweater!
B008U8TYEM|5|Pros:<br /><br />extremely warm [what it covers; the styling excludes your ears though their is a pull down ear / neck protector which works but looks funny]<br />makes you look like a russian<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />None really, other than... it makes you look like a russian -- is this what you want? I like the style, its a great winter hat, very warm, and adds quite a bit of height to your appearance.<br /><br />Item shipped promptly and arrived very quickly.
B00PIM2CW4|5|Gorgeous dress and my wife loves it!  (I love seeing her in it!)
B00GD9A5ZC|5|I absolutely love this dress, especially for the price. It fits perfectly, looks amazing and is very comfortable. I'm short (5'0&#34;) so I was worried about the dress being too long, but it wasn't an issue!<br />I definitely recommend this dress!
B000VZQX8M|5|Perfect for blocking the sun
B00576U0P2|2|I've worn this style for about 15 years and purchased them in different places. This particular one was much smaller than those purchased previously.
B008OGWIY8|5|ok
B00OY7QNIS|5|I'm 5'6, 165lbs and the medium fit great. I love this longer top to wear with skinny jeans. Soft material and great fit. I love this top!
B00BJORK04|5|This set is very cute on. I was going to order a medium but read some of the reviews so i decided on a large and it fits nicely. Some parts dont stretch where they maybe should but it is still very comfortable. I just ordered another one but in a different color, and not sure why the color change makes them more expensive than others, so hopefully it fits the same.
B008PVTWKU|2|So, the jacket itself is awesome. It's a great faux leather, feels great on, but there are a few drawbacks. The \\"hoody zipper lining\\" is just a hoody and zipper strip attached with buttons and elastic. Purely there for decoration. The second and most important thing is, their sizing chart. I actually am a 3X. I have no idea in what world that jacket is a 3X, unless you are a junior size or something. That was ridiculous. The so-called 3X is more like a large, MAYBE an XL. DEFINITELY NOT a 3X. If they had their sizing chart actually correct, this would definitely be worth the money, but because it's not, I'm sending this right back.
B00E4ADQB2|5|Bought for my wife for a birthday present.  She loved it!
B00BNB47UE|4|The fit is perfect!  The straps are a bit wide, but overall it is very comfortable.  I wish they came in more colors.
B000N8PZAO|2|Smaller than I expected
B00GWZZ26E|5|Love the reddish/orange color. Very unique.
B00UMGZ25K|5|Great skirt! fit wonderfully, nice and light material. I am 5'5&#34; and ordered a small. it was nice length, does not drag or anything. Flattering.
B00EQXPA3O|5|The smell out of the package is disgusting but after the initial eye watering smell leaves, it is a beautiful scarf and I love wearing it.
B00N2UPY1A|3|Fit as expected
B00ACIGUBI|5|material nice
B00B35SDWI|5|Product is exactly as advertised and fit perfect.  The shipping was faster than projected and the hat box was constructed to guarantee your hat arrived in pristine condition.  Knew exactly what hat I wanted and this was the best price around.  Extremely pleased.
B005OBE8S0|5|Without being gross, I'll say these bras give a nice shape. They're comfortable and of good quality. My favorite Le Mystere style yet.
B0041GBL5M|2|If this was leather, this would be a very gorgeous shoe.  I knew it was not leather, based on the price. However, its not even a good-looking PLU.  Had to return it.
B00CMB7SEG|5|Just as described. Thank you!! &#60;3
B001F6UCG0|5|Bought for my 6 year old daughter and it fits great!
B00YEEZQX4|5|I just got this product and is a great product! Is exactly what I was looking for! Great quality, love the color and everything! Ideal for traveling, or just everyday when I carry my kid diaper bag, that way I don't need to carry my bulky wallet, that needs an extra bag or purse. Also as a nurse student, is also great, because is limited what you can carry on your scrubs. I will definitively recommend this product, and I will get some more for family members.
B00M3O3IUU|3|Fits
B00JDYVSCS|2|The shirt looked and was well made. However it ran about 2 sizes smaller than I normally wear. Perhaps they're using Asian sizing
B008CN5M4G|4|Works good.  No complaints at all.
B00MJJ170C|5|Pj's were awesome, better than expected.
B00EL3RUY6|5|Elegant and not too heavy.  A great coat.
B00OYOE3GU|5|These wreath headbands are really pretty!  We were pleasantly surprised at the quality since the cost was so good on these.
B00A3HHSFU|4|I bought these pants for my boyfriend.  He has Levi jeans that are 32x32 and fit him perfectly.  I saw reviews that recommended buying a size down, so I bought him 31x32.  However, these were too tight on him, uncomfortably so.  I returned these and ordered a 32x32 and they fit much better.  I'm not sure why people recommended to size down.  If you know your size (especially in Levi's styles) then I recommend getting the same size that you are.<br /><br />One of his complaints was that they sit a little low on his waist, and he feels like whenever he bends over, it slides even further down his back/butt.  This makes it slightly uncomfortable for him. To remedy this, he tucks in his button downs and wears a belt, which prevents any skin/underwear from showing.<br /><br />I love the coloring though, and I think the slender cut of the legs look really nice on him :)  He is around 6 feet and has a pretty slender frame.  They are a little tighter than the Levi's 514 that he normally wears, but they aren't too tight.  He mentioned if they were any tighter, they would be uncomfortable on him.  Overall, I love how they look on him, and he does as well.
B003IYYE8E|5|My Undercover Mama nursing tank has easily become my favorite thing to wear...no joke!    So, the deal is, this tank top has no straps on it. But it does have those nursing clips that are on your nursing bras...you know the ones. So this makes it perfectly easy to attach to your nursing bra at the very same place you use to open your bra to nurse your baby! It is so rad, I'm telling you!!    I want one in every color!!    I was sent the gray one and it's adorbs. I love everything about it. It's that great stretchy material (95% cotton and 5% spandex!), so it's got some give, but just enough. My favorite thing about this tank is that you don't have to worry about stretching out the neck, like I do with my other tanks. And then they look all wonky. Yeah, that doesn't happen with these! It's so sweet!!    They also have so many different colors to choose from. Oh! And it fits true to size, which is always a good thing these days. And it's pretty long, which I adore in tank tops. Delish!
B00MNGMG2E|1|Your sizes seem to be for Asia body type not Americans
B00936UHEG|5|I bought this tie for my husband, who wears a suit to work every day.  It looks great with all of his suits- grey, brown, tan, and black.  It was a great price, too!
B007JX501K|2|very disappointed in d color I order a grey but d grey in d picture is a blackish grey I got a whitish grey which I don't like false advertising I have had it with buying what I see and don't get it, I wouldn't  even think of sending it back I will just give it away
B00HA2NPIA|4|run a lil big..otherwise perfect jeans
B004Z4YVNE|5|I love the way the coat looks on the hanger and even more on the husband.  He also is in love with it, great fit and super comfy.
B002BYFEKE|4|The only reason I gave this four stars instead of 5 is personal preference. I prefer a little longer leg length in my shorts. Otherwise these fit perfectly and don't ride up into \\"wedgieville\\" after a while which says a lot about how well they are made. The waistband is very comfortable. The pouch holds up well giving security without sacrficing comfort.
B001ELL60M|5|I won't wear under wire bras, too uncomfortable for me.The bra I used to buy was discontinued, it wasn't perfect but the best fit I had found. After years of searching, purchasing so many different makes and styles and making do with the best fit I could find and wasting money on bras that proved unsatisfactory I decided to check out a sports bra. I have finally found a full figure bra that comes in size 34C, fits perfectly and is sooo comfortable!!  I am ordering more of this one!!
B00ACIG82O|4|Nice shirts.......and cooler than normal undershirts, but not quite as cool as I thought they would be.  That is not a complaint, but I like to wear a shirt like this year-round but in the summer it does get a bit warm with one.  These are<br />cooler, but not as cool as some shirts I have had for a few years that have been well washed and have become cooler in the process.  I will likely order more of these, however.
B00JFSQ19C|1|Its not a dress like i expected
B00DSGKOD6|3|I knew it would be a bit on the big side. However the red is more of a light red, teetering on the pink.
B009T9TJ78|5|item performs as described and the variety of the sizes is great. would definitely buy again and recommend to others
B0065A1VXY|5|When buying a slip for your special day dont try and save money by buying a cheep sip from ebay. I did and didn't work out very well, total waste of money. Read through many reviews and didn't want the hassle of a hoop skirt. This one had the best ratings...i received this today and even out of the box not fluffed out it is full and is going to give my gown the extra fluff that it needed without the hassle of a hoop. I do recommend putting an elastic band for the tie to keep it up. But besides that extremely happy with the fullness of this slip. You truly get what you pay for....highly recommended for the ball gown look!
B00EDF7EJ8|2|This jacket is advertised as machine washable, the cleaning instruction tag reads dry clean. I will not be able to wear it as I intended to when I ordered it.
B00R8D16UA|4|Love these jeans. Wish they would be a bit longer. Other than that-I would order again.
B00ARSO7QS|1|The item was a bit small (bought a large) and the design wasn't as described. I literally lost money from all the hassle of waiting a few weeks before I got it and having to pay $30 to ship it back to China and I'm only getting a $26 refund?!? Outrageous!!
B0050DZ0DE|5|beautiful tie
B0093KURFQ|3|Was smaller then expected. Very sexy though.
B00GK6AMNS|2|Lightweight....very thin material.
B00CAV8HJI|5|Finally I've found jeans that fit! I've been looking for jeans that won't get big and bagger after wearing them for only an hour or two. These are just right - not tight, not at all loose.  They do FIT, in the stretchy kind of way.  Perfect.
B00FSB5TSY|5|soft and pretty comp!
B001AF170G|3|it runs a little small for the dimensions that they gave in the sales information.
B000DT7KCY|4|About a year ago I tried on a similar bra by the same brand at a department store but I had already decided to buy two others so I couldn't really afford all three. Being a 32DD it's hard to find bras that size and for under $50, so when I saw this bra in my size and at that price I had to buy it. After wearing it the first time I was really pleased, I found it quit comfortable and my only complaint is that I wish the straps were wider. Other than that though this bra is amazing.
B00D300XH4|4|Somewhat long but otherwise good, not something that a little sewing knowhow can't fix
B002LMWO2M|3|I ordered these pants to replace one of my favorite pair of khakis. The pair I bout last year was the same make and model, same size, but made in Haiti. On the label of my new pants, it says they are made in Nicaragua. There is a slight difference in the size of the legs. On my new pants, they are too baggy. The old pants fit wonderfully. My advice is to be careful about the country of origin.
B0080CACMG|5|Who would have thought I'd be writing a review on socks but these are just awesome.<br />They fit great.... I wear a 10EE shoe.......sometimes 10.5 to get the width I need.<br />The Merino wool blend makes these socks very comfortable.<br />A little pricey but worth it. I'm buying more.
B00412DEJW|4|I was very pleasantly surprised by this costume. While it is quite thin and needs a layer underneath, it was perfect for our murder mystery party. Didn't use the crown as I had a wig with its own jewels and I didn't use the blue cape. It was great without it. For this price, this was a home run!!
B001PTGMAC|3|The pants material is nice, they have inside knee patches for extra durability, but they are NOT slim fit. The waist was about 3 inches too big, and the legs are super baggy.
B00NLJ4U26|4|Nice for a costume and fits well everywhere but the chest, these are made for busty women.
B008UKZ0A2|4|as espected
B00WS3GAX8|4|I looked at lot of different makers/versions of this swimsuit. I noticed that people were having a lot of trouble finding the right size. If I had paid attention only to Amazon's size chart, I would have bought an XL. However, I noticed that this seller,Ebuddy, included some very specific information for each size. This is what was provided for size medium: M: US4-6 Cup: 32C,32D,34B,34C,36A,36B,38A Jean size: 27-28 and this is what was provided for size large: L: US6-8 Cup: 34C,34D,36B,36C,38A,38B, Jean size: 28-29<br /><br />I'm usually a size 6 for pants and skirts, and size 27 or 28 for jeans, but sometimes size 29, and a size 12 for tops and dresses. Using Ebuddy's size notes, I had a choice of medium or large. Given that my cup size was included in both lists (38A) I opted to buy the medium size and was pleased to find a perfect fit all around. My guess is that the large would have fit equally well.
B00FY8UL3Y|4|This is probably the best grumpy cat shirt because of the image chosen.
B00SJ6KKUW|5|Perfect fit and well made.
B00EHW6VEQ|5|Great quality &fit
B004CPVUKI|1|I washed this shirt with laundry belonging to both of my 2 sons.  It turned ALL of their clothes pink.  Ruined an entire load of laundry!  Do not buy!  I have never had this problem before.  I am very upset and diaappointed in this product.  This item should be removed from Amazon.
B004CR4Q4S|4|wasn't sure about this product it's the first of it's kind i have bought. I took a chance and i really like it. it's comfy and works well also my girl loved it.. always a plus. i would recommend it for sure :)
B000HTG5XU|5|Excellent costumer service<br />Rob.
B001T6HAPM|5|Absolutely love this bra. It is supportive yet very comfortable. I could wear it everyday. I am going to order 2 more.
B00N0PU7NW|5|Lovely maternity dress that can even be worn after . Material is nice. Not see through at all.
B00DRUYQUK|3|The coat is beautiful. With that said, its much shorter than I expected. I'm 5'3&#34; and it hits me mid-thigh. Its also tighter than the measurement said. So I can't wear it.
B0057DXUPW|5|I bought this for my daughter and not only did it fit perfectly but it was such good quality! I would highly recommend this dress, its so cute!
B00GKCA7PA|3|Great shirt, fit as expected which is snug.
B00E89HW1O|5|I wear a medium in regards to almost all other DC shirts, hoodies, and tees, and so I initially ordered this jacket in a medium. I was a bit disappointed to find that it fit like a large, and so I had to send it back and get a small instead, which will make it the only &#34;small&#34; sized item in my closet. I'm 6 feet tall and 150 lbs just to give you an idea of how surprised I was to learn that a medium was too large. That being said, the jacket feels like it is of high quality build, looks good, and seems like it will keep me warm this winter. It hasn't got cold enough to fully test out it's abilities, but I feel like it will hold up well.
B00RKE34M0|1|It's awful. The proportions on this shirt are a joke, it is twice as wide as other brands with this same design and 3 inches too short. It almost looks like a crop top, not like the photo shows at all. I would say it can be worn as a pajama cause of how oversized it is but it's uncomfortable and itchy as heck too so not even good for that. Don't waste your money, there are plenty of other good shirts on amazon with the same design.
B005IXMBKG|3|Not the same color as listed it is more of a classic yellow.
B00E5BSOXA|5|Seems nice so far, looks amazing.
B00F06JY4M|1|don't fit right to small
B008WNYEEA|2|The wallet is very low quality but decent for the price. I would send it back, but for $5 I'm not gonna worry about it. ill see how long it lasts me. Leather also feels fake and is very thin. One pocket ripped while trying to get out my card. also the zipper for the change pouch is very stiff and hard to zip (It also adds to the bulkiness of the wallet). other than that, its good if you have a low budget. (Don't recommend for gifts) they wont use it... Trust me. 100% honest opinion. And my arrived with scuff marks all over it and a rip in the license holder plastic.
B00QMS9P7S|3|If you have very skinny arms and no shoulders may work for you. Soft leather cute style. Obviously made for Asian body type. I am 5'6&#34; size 6 and bought I bought a preteen jacket.
B002EDYQ0Q|4|The hat thing is terrible, but the rest of the costume is great. Good price.
B004SWGN16|5|I like  this overall<br />I always wanted a pair of overall they were a little long but i am a little short and easy to fix<br />I will be buying a other pair in the future
B0059865RU|2|Unfortunately, I thought this was going to be a great coin purse for London but after a week of use, the leather didn't stay attached to the hardware and began to fall apart.
B00FXT6ZPM|5|This is a very comfy bra, good support.  Fits a tad on the tight side.
B00KQUNSGW|3|I kept having to pull the back of my pants up. Not too bad but by the end of the day,  it really got old. Other than that they feel nice and comfy.
B008FFCXU2|3|you keep having to buy new ones because the material gives out after about 6 uses. But is okay for a quick fix.
B00CTYU92Y|5|Absolutely luv this... Got gold & plan 2 get silver....
B00I44UBT4|3|too large L like XL but The quality is very good  I like it but can not wear send my father
B006M5YCTC|2|The beret was sized for a child not for an adult.  I have purchased hats  and caps before with no problems, this beret was unusually tight and barely covered the top of my head.  I would have returned it but the cost of postage wasn't worth it.
B006ZOI5XY|5|This top is nice a little tight around the chest, but not too bad, it's loose on the bottom. If you are a thicker sized person you might like the fit of this and it is a light weight cotton material. I am pleased with this purchase and will purchase again in other colors. I wouldn't go any larger than a couple of inches over bra size because then the bottom may be entirely too large. So it's narrower at the top and looser fitting towards the bottom.
B00B71CJB4|5|This fit the new baby just fine.  Baby was bigger than expected and the 3 month size was perfect.  Easy ordering and prompt delivery.
B00KRHJ9K8|4|I haven't received my item yet but I'm sure it's gonna be an amazing wallet
B000N8RZNY|5|no comment
B00HQC6MJS|5|VERY GOOD
B007X05RP8|5|These are very comfortable and warm pajamas without being sweltering hot.  I am in between a large and x-large and bought the x-large size.  The top fits perfectly for me, just a little baggy.  The bottoms tho are a bit bigger and I have to keep pulling them up.  They are also very long.  I would say overall, compared to other X-large pajamas I have bought, they run a little on the small size overall.  The material is soft and doesn't bunch during the night.  Overall I love them and wear them often
B00DHVFAOA|4|Looks great feels great so far.They came right on schedule. May buy a pair for my sister now she loves them
B004M6XUI2|2|Looks cheap. The material is thin. The compartment for bills has a thin cardboard backing inside to make it feel thicker. Granted it's only $10 when I bought it ($12.85 total with tax and shipping fee), I never would have bought it if I knew it was this cheap-looking.
B006LHMESW|4|I like the way this one fits on me. It's snug but comfortable.  I also bought the Champion Men's Performance 2 Pack Stretch Long Boxer Brief, which I didn't realize is made of a cotton type material. This one (Tech version) is made of a better material, seems to be of higher quality and hugs your body better (well, it costs more per brief). I sweat a lot during workout, but I don't have any discomfort or wet feeling in these briefs.  An area of improvement I'd ask for (although this one is not that bad) is that it should have a stronger the crotch support.
B00SNK4OXS|4|I needed a white shirt. White. This is more of an off-white and doesn't match my uniform pants or blazer. Disappointed that I can't wear it for its intended use, but it's a nice enough shirt otherwise.
B00EYBI8DM|5|These pants were perfect for my husband to lounge around the house in.
B00IDHAKYS|5|Good material  fits well would buy again.
B00EALWHHY|5|I ordered this in a XXL ( as was stated to order up), and the sizing was spot on! I was so very relieved. This corset is very beautiful and also well made. You definitely have to undo the laces in the back to get into it, and then of course tighten them back to your liking once its on. It as a side zipper as well. I would recommend this to any and every woman who is in search of a beautiful/quality corset. Oh, and the fact that it leaves your midback showing is  a hightlight to this item and I do not mind that at all! I just recently ordered one in white! and would order a third
B007WADUVC|5|The shirt is adorable, good quality, and wonderfully low priced, I am delighted to own it.  It arrived within the time agreed to at check-out.  There were a couple of issues with the shirt:  1) The shirt is advertised as a &#34;bat wing&#34; and &#34;Dolman&#34; sleeved, and it is clearly not.  2) When I opened the package the shirt was quite damp and smelled strongly of Kerosene(?).  I threw it in the wash, and it came out just beautifully.  All's well that ends well, and I am quite pleased with my shirt.
B008GE3KE0|4|i have 3 different pairs of hue jeggings, all a size medium. i am by no means thin, but a medium fits like a glove. i had to buy these denim jeggings in a large as medium wasn't available and i am a bit disappointed. the length is perfect but the waist is a bit of a low rise. i mean, i do have a JLo butt, but like i said, a medium has always fit perfectly. maybe because this is the first time wearing them, but i do love their jeggings so obviously i will give them another chance :)
B003A10LH8|5|Got them for my husband he loves it great quality also very cute
B00EWC076Y|4|I love Jockey plus size underwear.
B00EDTNHMC|5|Perfect khakis. I have this pair and the same in bootcut, they are wonderful work pants, would be good for school as well. I wear holes in my work pants, and these last around 6 months for me, whereas most last 2 or 3 months tops. Fit is great, waist fits well, legs and butt are nice and snug without being ridiculous and restraining movement. I'm 5'2 so they run a bit long, but I can actually get away without tailoring them, which is a plus for me. I am slowly stocking up on these.
B00NIHY78S|5|So cute!! Love it!
B00CJ8AXYE|1|The fabric color is the same, but the style and fit are different. Believe the negative reviews, and do not order this dress.
B00FRAQLG0|1|I look like I'm trying to be a clown in this dress... give me a red nose and some colorful hair and bam..... I thought is was white but no it's a dingy tan creamy color and the black part is like costume material...it looks fake
B00ULX7WCU|5|I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR OVER A YEAR FOR THE LONG SLEEVE VERSION AND FINALLY FOUND ONE..I AM STILL LOOKING FOR THE SHORT SLEEVE VERSION BUT CANNOT FIND ONE ANYWHERE.  IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED.
B008E5CDEO|4|it fits my shoulders and sleeves but a bit long in the torso. good thick material and it was put together well
B00ADHGL0S|1|This top fit more like a medium than an Extra Large.
B00HDOBE4C|3|The shirt is not as tailored as I would like and I do not like the fabric used for the shirt
B00P268QJE|3|I thought this would be a loose over-legging shirt. It's loose and long but very stiff. I'm still washing with softener to relax it.
B004OA7QVI|5|This Bodysuits are super soft and well made with a soft cotton, plain white, they are easy to put on the baby and have an extra row of snaps so this mean the baby will used this for more months this bodysuits doesn't shrink after washing they are made with hi quality cotton, very good product I recommend them.
B008D327Q6|5|This is my second Out of Print shirt. My favorite book is Jane Eyre and I'm a t-shirt aficionado, so I had to have this. The print is absolutely beautiful and great quality. I like the fit of the shirt a lot as well. It's got the usual girly slim fit, a feminine scoop neckline that doesn't dip obnoxiously low, and the sleeves aren't too short--they actually cover your shoulders. Everything from Out of Print is so well done and worth the price!<br /><br />Also, if you hover in between sizes--I usually hover in between a medium or large and the large is perfect.<br />  
B00HAV6VLE|5|I love it.
B000IBH7RU|5|thanks
B00JQSZT3K|5|Feel good and got me laid
B00CXXG8SK|5|Love the looks, and compliments
B00ISET9VG|5|I've been using this since I got it. It is well constructed. There is plenty of room inside the pouches. The cell phone pouch accommodates my Samsung S4 Mini equipped with the Otter Box protection with plenty of room to spare. It could easily fit a larger phone. The strap buckle is sturdy and secure. This fanny pack fits me perfectly even though I have a large waistline; this was a definite plus.
B001JBNDLM|5|Very good for the price
B009T4P5QM|3|Thin fabric, the glitter is falling all over the chairs, car seats etc.The fit is OK.
B00FFGGRMY|4|Be careful, the outer tulle layers easily rip. Have your girls be very careful taking the dress on and off.
B00AK3FZ20|4|Nice
B00AE1SSHW|5|I've purchased four of these bras so far. As others have mentioned, they do not provide much support, but that's not what these are intended for. They're perfect for sleeping, night time feedings, and being comfy around the house. I'm so grateful I purchased these while still pregnant bc they were my favorite item I brought to the hospital!!! Trust me, you want these soft, comfortable,  bras. Plus the little rose applique provides a little something to make them special. Incidentally,  if you're looking for a more supportive, &#34;going out of the house bra&#34;, the same company makes a great version of those as well.
B000WVGJNE|5|FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAD A SMALL WALLET ALMOST LIKE THIS ONE.  I USE IT ONLY TO CARRY BUSINESS CARDS AND MY WORK ID CARD.  BUT THAT LITTLE WALLET FINALLY FELL APART AND I NEEDED A NEW ONE.  I COULD NOT FIND A SIMILAR PRODUCT IN A STORE, AND I WAS RELIEVED WHEN I FOUND THIS ON AMAZON.  I RECEIVED THIS WALLET IN THE MAIL WITHIN THREE DAYS AND FROM THE MOMENT I TOOK IT OUT OF ITS LITTLE BOX, I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THE DESIGN AND THE SIZE.  THE EXPANDABLE SECTION IS PERFECT FOR CARRYING 2 X 3 1/2 INCH BUSINESS CARDS AND THE WINDOW SECTION COMFORTABLY HOLDS MY WORK ID CARD.  LIKE IT SAYS ABOVE, THIS IS JUST WHAT I WANTED.  oH BY THE WAY, THE PRICE WAS GOOD TOO.
B009YB4WLY|5|Nice dress
B00R68020M|5|Couldn't be happier with this hat
B00V8UG5IM|5|Love this sexy fun dress. Can't wait to wear it! The blue pops and is such a playful color. You will want this dress!!
B00NL0VZZ0|4|I really like it does hide the tummy area. Might have ordered maybe a size bigger. Is shorter than I expected but I still like it.
B001RNO49W|5|Perfect! So happy.
B003JOTJF6|4|The brown one was okay but I have ordered two of the pleated one before.  Last summer I ordered a brown one in the black style and this year I ordered larger black one again (pleated) and its better, but still a little snug.  What's going on with this type skirt?
B00686Q8YC|5|This shirt made days at the beach so much easier. I burn easily and hate applying sunscreen every couple hours. This shirt is lightweight, cool, dries quickly, and protects from sun exposure quite well! It's great quality, and made in North America. I'll buy a few more for next season.
B0017IY7QM|3|we ended up having to take  large amounts out of one dress (they were for a wedding, so we had multiple) and put it into the one claiming to be a 3x.
B004VXIOBE|5|Prodcut is well made  I gave this as a gift and got a favorable response.  Very rich looking tie  great colors
B00IMOCSIS|5|Super comfy outfit for baby and fit perfectly.  I will have to reorder a bigger size soon!
B000H6F19M|4|Bought these after reading the reviews of several other brands.  Decided to buy one pair to verify they would meet my needs.  Thus far, they have worked out perfectly.  Keep me warm when I'm out running in freezing temperatures as well as when lounging around the house.  Color has stayed pretty consistant after several washes.
B00IOGWYZ6|4|Great, pretty dress but a little long in the torso. Love that the straps are crossed in the back my 2 ballerinas. Bought this in pink and blue and have received many compliments.
B00844M84A|5|It fits perfectly. I'm a girl, this is a unisex shirt and it still looks great! Quality Material. Don't hesitate to buy if you love 5fdp !
B002TVUHKQ|5|Cute and love fir baby gift.
B005MIK4AQ|5|Fits great, perfect length, comfortable to wear.  Great price!
B007JAA4D2|2|Costume was nice. Fit my 9 month old. Not too tight nor lose. However, the product did not include the headpiece as described. The piece I was most excited for n it did not come with the package.
B00B9MABIO|5|My daughter loves anything cheetah and this cap is perfect for her collection!!  She loves it and will wear it all the time outside.
B00MPTUDQK|5|Not real baggy, more slender
B00K5IAGSS|4|These are very colorful and warm. Fit as expected. I wear these often during the cold weather months.
B00H8VKM5C|4|Its super tight on me, as I thought I ordered an xxl, oops, but if you actually wear an xl, it should be perfect. The design is perfect and  the tapering is as shown, which I was a little surprised by. The straps and armholes are also comfortable.
B001F9UGJK|5|can't wait to wear this under many things!
B00LX0ID6O|5|The Grin&Bear shirts are my favorite because they are all stylish and fitted to show off my lean body unlike most shirts that are designed to hide the body and any body fat.  If you're average and not lean or well-defined, these will probably be too tight on you.  If you like your shirts tight to show off your physique, then this is perfect for it.<br /><br />This design looks and fits me like the photo.  It's exactly as I expected and I like to wear it.
B0074DAHWC|5|Very nice fit, takes some getting used to in order to sag and it does require some shaping at times.  Made of a strong, durable material that will last you months.
B005358EUA|5|good product
B002M4DNUG|5|So sexy !it is just described as sexy for me , it makes me wanna seduce my hasband all the time lol
B00C7IOPUY|5|It Fits great. Looks Good, bought two of these. Had lots of compliments. I recommend this to everyone.  HOW MUCH MORE DO I HAVE TO WRITE FOR THIS REVIEW.
B00ZYYIM8Y|5|comfortable and perfect for tight clothes
B00ACIGNMY|5|comfortable
B00CWADTEK|4|exelent
B004NBYAWG|5|Very soft and comfortable
B00RO4NDHW|1|The quality is too low to be selling this item as a &#34;bra&#34; and &#34;underwear&#34;.
B00JLXW36Q|5|it is amazingly comfortable<br />very loose, but try not to wear it outside; it looks kind of like a pajama<br />if you ought to wear it outside, wear it with a waist belt
B004D4Y4D8|5|Good fit for my slender nephew. Good deal and good fit.  He has worn them ever since he got them.
B0031U0QBY|5|They will hold up a house.
B004A7YLQS|3|Well, the wallet is not as big as i have excepted.<br /><br />Please do put size in the website, so that other buyers can know what exactly size the wallet is.
B0009IYRBQ|5|He loves it!
B007Q3USJW|5|one of my favorite t-shirts (thin cotton material as i mentioned in an earlier review/post, just seems to fit my body better. even tho, you have to be careful & delicate about thinly made t-shirt (u can tell they're much cooler on the body, but not made that well & seems rips very easy)
B00EMB67WS|3|Though it fits perfectly and looks great the strings on the top aren't that sturdy.  I tried to tie them as  best as I could but they still feel as if they'll untied and I'll lose my top any minute.  To avoid a very embaressing wardrobe malfunction, I cute the ties and added clasps so that it would stay secure.
B00IHMCSAS|5|Excellent quality!
B009Z7FDHO|3|I am a 36D, which is what I ordered.  The fit is perfect and it doesn't creep up like most slips do (I'm 5'4&#34; and 125lbs).  I ordered this in lieu of spanx because I loved the fact it was seamless in front and back and neckline was what I was looking for.The material is thinner than I was expecting (it doesn't hide panty lines so I recommend pantyhose or commando). Compression slip is not an accurate description. Overall it's acceptable as slip for an unlined dress.
B000OVEOTS|5|My husband loves them.  I have to order him some more of them.
B005ZCNQHM|5|The coat was very nice. The style looked good. Unfortunately it was too large and we had to return it. The XL was not available.
B00K6N1L36|5|Nice and lightweight.  By reading reviews I knew it ran small, or maybe Americans are just running larger. I already recommended it to some friends.
B00VF5TFXC|5|love them, they are supper comfortable and amazing price..will order again and recommend to buy
B00L9V1JJU|5|Love this sweater! I needed a navy sweater for a family picture & it was perfect! Fits great & love the open stitching.
B00DZJFTLI|5|Perfect!
B00A65Z8RO|5|Love this!
B00F35FM32|4|For a 1X, the shirt is kind of tight. The style is very nice though.
B009TAZJK8|5|Awesome product, It is super comfy and really warm in cold weather. I literally go outside in 10 degree weather and this is absolutely warm enough. Love it and plan on getting them in all colors!
B009YR4LXM|5|color is exactly the same as the picture.
B00CH5UR1S|5|Very nice.
B00JSG6326|5|I LOVED THIS TOP -- but it didn't fit across my bustline.  It has beads and sequins and lots of glitter.  It is lined and has a lovely flow and it looked like it cost more than it did.  I wish I wish I wish it had fit.  *sigh*
B000HNF14U|2|I bought this and ended up returning it.  The \\"belt\\" included is a piece of fabric with the silver buckles painted on that you tie behind your back.  The dress itself is a cheap see-through fabric.  I didn't take the wig out to look at it because I knew as soon as I saw the rest of the product I was returning it and I couldn't return it if the wig was opened.  I returned the product and made my own with higher quality fabric at a fraction of the price.  It may not be the licensed product but it looks nicer.  If I were in charge of Star Wars licensing I would be embarrassed to offer such a chintzy product with the SW logo attached.
B00G8RTLPO|5|FEEL TOO SATISFTIED WITH THE PURCHASE. I CONSIDERED ALWAYS FOR MY PURCHASES, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH AMAZON. I'LL RECOMMEND YOU.
B003OF2XRG|3|Great product but it was a little large. I ordered a medium and I usually wear a large shirt but the product was a little loose.
B00IO9H516|5|My kids love these socks, they are a great thickness and super cute colors.  However, be warned that the colors you receive won't match the picture.
B00F9RNVM8|2|nice and warm for sure, but way to large!
B009FSVCBE|4|Super cute dress! The quality is not too bad as well as the price. It looks just like the picture and fits my 2yr old niece like a glove. It's close to her ankles but that's what the look we were going for. I gave it 4/5 only because the accent stud on the belt is very cheap quality. But everything else is nice!
B00ERPNN80|5|The photo is misleading. I bought this as a gift in a hurry and didn't notice the sale only includes the scarf. No accessory to wear it as shown in the picture. The material is nice and it has a good length to it, but she would've liked the clasp too. All in all a good product.
B00COYNIU4|5|I love the jacket!  It fits great and is comfortable and stylish. The buttons are adorable!!!
B00OO4AK80|5|it fits perfect !
B004R8RK4K|5|These pants were delivered on time, in clean packaging that prevented them from getting dirty or stained in transit. They fit my boy who is a solid &#34;8&#34; in pants, with enough length at the bottom to allow for the next growth spurt. I would order again!
B00ENLM76C|5|Comfortable
B0031KF44I|5|Fits very well, looks cool, quite warm although light and not thick.
B001JBNDLW|5|What can I say but these fit as expected. Not too small, not too big, just right. My only complaint compared to my old briefs, these are super white and the funny thing is, they don't have holes where my old ones had them. If you like super bright briefs without holes then these are for you.
B003H17Z20|5|this actually covers my butt...completely. doesn't ride up either. most undies don't do this. and it doesn't run past my belly button, so i'm happy.
B006GF8GFO|2|The color is outstanding, but to call this a dress is ridiculous. A skin tight.looong tank is more like it. Was very disappointed bec/ I\\"ve ordered from them before and was pleased. This truly is a JOKE!
B004YTJFYU|5|Perfect ,fun,pants,also great for yoga and festivals too!! Namaste Sat Nam!!!<br />Already getting a ton of compliments on  them ...thks agian !!<br />This color in this picture is very light ,as to in person ,these are very very, rich bold colors!!!
B00PA9KDQW|3|Its good.
B00B55LI0U|5|THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT.
B006YK1SN8|5|Love these socks!  They are the perfect thickness to wear with tennis shoes and the height is perfect so they don't get blisters.  The socks stay on nicely and do not slide down at all.
B00J06FQUY|2|too big
B0000AWHAA|4|This product was exactly as described. I've used it for running, both as a base layer and also the only layer.  It has helped keep my face warm from the biting MN wind.  With more severe windchills I've put a fleece  balaclava over it and it formed a great base layer.
B00HQZSCZW|4|I like the dress but a little bigger than thought it would be. I have decided to keep I no longer have the original packaging.<br />I would recommend purchasing this dress to others.
B0046BE5U0|5|I am DD,  I wanted to use the sports bra for nursing my son while at home. It works perfect for what I need it for! It is comfortable, and convenient.  I am not a small person so save your money on expensive nursing bra's. I got the them in size 2x.
B0048A0V4I|1|This is a terrible product. You couldnt GIVE me this. The mask is not even wearable. . Cant see out of it.. not ridged at all. Ripped material on both hands. Go to the dollar store for a better costume
B00HWFCK22|5|i love it! not too long, not too short. and size is perfect too.
B00DSOGTHI|4|Nice material and design but runs small. Fit is too small, for a slim guy not a regular one. Seller was good about return and refunded shipping. Would purchase again with larger sizes but they don't carry larger sizes. They cater to young slim men;)
B00ACIFLAO|1|These boxers are rough to the touch and on the skin. I was expecting them to be soft and comfortable and they where like 80 grit sandpaper on my...body.
B00FQHNXGK|5|Very good!
B00K0DOCDS|5|Now to find the perfect skirt to go with this.  This lovely lace stretchy can go on or off the shoulder, and is well made and comfortable. I plan on using it for my daughter's wedding.  The tube top inside is not terribly long, Just below the navel, so plan to cover that midsection should you need to. I plan to wear it over a strapless purple dress if I can't find a high waisted skirt. Bonus: soft lace, softer tube top, not scratchy or painful.  Love how it comes down on my hands, yet it isn't too hot.  Breathes wonderfully- need that in August.  Plan on getting the blue & red ones next.  I'm 5'4&#34;, 160 lbs, and the XL hides all sins.  Whew!  and Yahoo.
B00GD60IDO|4|My son really liked these.  I bought 14-16 size and they seem a little long.  He's 12, weighs 110 and is 5'3&#34;.
B00O417ZPO|5|Fits great!!! I would definitely recommend. I am 5'2 167lbs with DDs. I got a 4x after reading the reviews since my boobs are big. The cups are a little small but I was expecting that. Overall, great fit and I feel comfortable.
B009G1MOQ2|5|This cover up is very beautiful.  I normally wear a medium, I ordered the large, as crochet garments tends to shrink, but once you hit the water, it stretches.  My bust size is 38C, under arms 19 inches, hips 40 inches.  If my under arms were larger, I would have a problem with snug.  Over all a beautiful piece, as seen on the model.
B00A8JX8MK|1|Products cheaper Chinese products and Pakistani wear did not expect so.<br />I would wear casually cheaply.<br />However, for the smell of cloth and disinfected.<br />1-2 years in the future would wear well.<br />Hedge cotton cloth, then I will buy again
B00T8R4UIY|4|Took a while to get here, but is really nice material, not see-through, and soft fabric. Quality is as expected for $10 pants, some loose strings, but held up well the first night I wore them.
B00BB8VSFQ|5|The size is perfect the quality and colors are great the price also is great it is a great item to but
B0041EG3ZW|5|Great product
B00J7RWGBS|1|Im not much of a football fan but after one day of wearing this shirt in public, I realized how great the chiefs are. I didn't even know what the shirt meant or what the chiefs was. All I know now is that chiefs rock and the broncos should join a mighty mites league. Don't buy this shirt unless the name is changed to Broncos:}
B00HDA2QHK|5|Very good quality fast delivery fit well
B00APYRTL4|5|I always wear short's when weather permits as I do not like the feel of trousers. These however have changed my mind. They are the most comfortable trousers I have ever had. I love the fit and feel. And the expandable waist is so nice as is the price. Ordered four more pair.
B007APJQ5S|4|This hat is very durable and doesn't feel very cheap at all. The design isn't anything special, but it's a good plain cap for the spring/summer!
B00GW12QWQ|3|These shorts are OK, but I wish they had some pockets!  I prefer my shorts to have pockets on them.
B0008EOQDA|5|Good enough!
B00HK1J7T2|5|the best there is
B00IJVB4TI|1|Cost too much to return
B0080CQENM|5|I am extremely happy with this coat. I was shopping all over the place trying to find my five-year-old son a warm coat without having to give up on the cuteness factor, and this was the only place I was able to find one in his size. Even the ones on the Osh Kosh website this year weren't anything that I felt like spending the money on due to the style. This coat is fleece lined and extremely warm, cute, fitted and true to size. I've already washed it (inside out and on gentle, just to be safe) and it washes well.
B00COH44K4|5|Runs a little small, but an adorable swim suit :) it does not have a built in swim diaper so make sure you get those too!
B00GS19C1I|5|The shirt was exactly as shown on website and the fit is perfect, I would recommend this since the quality of the material is great
B00EOHT31M|5|Great pajamas for the price.  Very soft & warm.  Makes a perfect gift for any special man in your life.
B0015PKB08|5|with arthritis in my toes, I need to be picky about footwear.  With Champion Performance, I have found &#34;the&#34; sock for me.  They are thick, warm, hold their shape, and fit my size 10 perfectly.
B0018OKSKY|5|My husband loves his Levi's.  They are probably his favorite pants.  Forget the fancy dress pants, even though he wears them everyday.  He still prefers his Levi's!  Forget the Dockers, he wants his Levi's.  He will never buy a different brand!
B00J9C8Z16|2|This brand does not fit as well as the Sub brand.  It is a good bit loose.  If I purchase compression, I would like compression...
B00I1RRGMO|2|I'm very petite so this tank top, which is the smallest size, does not fit as seen.  Maybe it would look better on someone else.
B00QUR1J3Y|5|Soft and warm and good quality.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00TZ5LHHQ|5|LOVED these pants.  As others mentioned they are a bit long, but for me they are no more so then any other pants I buy.  I am 5'5.5&#34; and approx 127lbs and purchased a size small.  They fit perfectly and are at most about 1 inch too long.  The material is so soft and the 2015 is not even noticeable with a shirt on. A great buy for anyone.
B00Q8Q7A30|5|It's beatiful
B0062SRD9U|4|I bought this jacket for my daughter she like it a lot , it look good and it look like it is real leather very soft .
B009YLKCC2|4|Nice, but a wee bit snug. I do like the styling and quality, so I'll make it work. Nice color.
B00C9P8JUW|5|Had to size up- I'm not a junior size. But I love and collect jean jackets. This is a nicely saturated blue denim that gives spark to a lot of the black I wear. I was looking for a jacket that was slightly cropped and fitted, not long and boxy - and this fit was just what I wanted.
B00LMNKHY8|5|Great Tie clips. I love the assortment of colors.  Looks great on.  Gentlemen keep your Ties in place with these 8 clips.  Looks expensive!!!
B000BU40PA|2|adult 2x is supposed to be a pretty big garment I thought but this 2x is about a medium or a tight large; definitely not a 2x. besides that nice for the price.
B00BXF8UPS|5|Very well made! The pants were a little shorter than expected, but it works with the style.
B005MXIB38|3|The detailing on this shirt is lovely, but it's too short.  It needs to be at least 4\\" longer to truly work as a maternity shirt, especially in the later months.  The sleeves could be a bit longer, too (maybe 2\\").
B003IWOKY4|4|I like bamboo clothing and the price was right<br /><br />Don't like to be forced to write more than I want
B00505DUCA|4|It's a little big on my boyfriend who normally wears a medium.  But he likes it.
B00FEEA7EQ|5|Fit as expected<br />Quality of product is okay but not the best<br />Most problem is with the zipper<br />It's little hard
B005B9KW2G|3|A little expensive for a product that doesn't feel all that durable. Looks good, but if worn regularly I suspect it would be in shambles rather quickly.
B00K1IGXSY|5|Very nice
B003CMYTDC|5|I love these socks!  They keep my feet toasty, and they are comfortable.  They wash well, and do not shrink even when dried.
B00ATM9OW4|5|What's not to love. I took a chance and purchased 8. Silk, great color and feel along with low price. I compared then to Bow Ties purchased from another on line retailer (TB) and the feel, shape and quality are similar at 1/3 of the price. Of the ones I purchased the stands outs were the 'Dark Blue Red Strip', 'Sky Blue Black Stripe', 'Black and Blue Stripe along with the 'Red Black & Yellow Plaids. Stunning look, you'll get compliments trust me. They arrived in about 2 weeks.
B00HSC50ZI|4|This dress is prettier on the model. It's pretty in person, but not how I imagined it to look on me. The dress I received looks brand new, however the boob pad inserts that are sewn in, look dingie. Like the dress has been worn. I'm keeping the dress because it's the style I was looking for, but I wish it was a different material.
B00CYRXTHS|3|Received tab was not symmetrical and looks a little funny.  I probably would not buy this again.
B00KXR6UBS|4|Its cute but It was too big for me.
B00OO1GHLM|4|A bit big for a medium but still love it.
B00EDQKJ80|5|Inbought this as a gift. The person loves it and it is beautiful on her! Wise purchase and a great gift!
B00AJU305S|5|I bought this item for my girlfriend and all I have to say is SHE LOVED IT!!  The pajamas made me out to be the perfect boyfriend in her eyes so good job!!  They shipped very quickly and she just bragged on how soft they are. Fellas if your looking to get your wife or girlfriend something for any occasion, this would make a great choice.
B006TCJOS2|3|my husband was very pleased wit this hat & it was $10 so you can't really complain...but sizing between the website & manufacturer seems confusing...i thought these fitted hats normally came sized S/M or L/XL...but this site had a large fit so i bought that for my husband. the hat came with a tag that says M/L & it's too small. i dont know if carhatt actually has more sizing options than most makers or if there's a mix-up between their sizing & amazon's size choices on their site...i dont know, maybe we werent sent an incorrect size? but fit aside, the hat is a nice color & seems like a quality hat, great buy for the $.
B004OPNXFQ|5|I love the X-Men!!!!!!!!! And of course this shirt.
B001AWZ098|5|These are very comfortable pants, they look great are good quality and perfect when you need something just a bit dressier than denim jeans.
B007UN3RO6|5|I bought these because they were cheap and had a better review then the others on amazon. I needed something to go with this 1960s dress I made. I was nervouse though because there was only one review and I was not sure what to make of it. However, these boots are very good quality, and have held up for the times ive worn them they could have charged more in my opinion. I would buy more if I needed. Shipping came super fast, i was very happy with that, and they run pretty true to size :)
B00LI7LO2W|1|I was not at all satisfied with this because the XL was too small and iI had tried this jacket on in that size in a store and it did fit so this was very frustrating for me.
B00QOTZ4BG|5|Everything  was perfect for my daughter!
B00KUKFBTA|5|I bought this tshirt for my Grand daughter and she LOVED it.  It was the only shirt she wanted to wear for days and days.  I would say Grandma scored points.  Well made and just too cute on.
B00WE14MJ8|5|I will say these are incredible quality and the fit is really nice. I have has some bad experiences in the past with clothes i ordered online not fitting right but not with this product. I was lucky enough to receive these for free for review and I truly recommend them!
B00N8GJMES|5|Runs small but super comfortable. Going to get other colors. I usually wear a large & xl wasn't an option but it fits anyway
B001CCNKB6|5|VERY soft, VERY substantial cashmere.  Very contemporary cut and fit.  High quality product at a great price.  Terrific value.  Very pleased.  Just wish it came in more colors.
B00DOZMCBS|3|This was very pretty but the sizing wasn't the same as other Bali products that I've purchased.  In this same order, I had two other Bali bras that fit beautifully.  This one, however, will need an extender.  Order one size up.
B0018OLH3G|4|My son loves his Levi's.<br />Comfortable, looks good and not expensive.<br />What else can you ask for from a pair of Jeans?
B00D420QNW|5|LOVE this!!!  The material feels &#34;felted&#34; so it is super comfy.  It's not baggy- but it isn't too tight, either.  I think if you were an &#34;apple&#34; it might hang up on your stomach- but it's great for women who are pear shapes.  The ruching on the neck and sleeves makes it super cute!  Like all Woolrich items, the quality is excellent.  The stitching is great and the zipper is robust.  I planned to take this on vacation- and I know I will get a lot of use out of this.
B002AN6APE|2|Advertised as fitting adults, but is more to scale with a child's costume. I purchased as part of a Roger Rabbit costume some time ago and really wasn't happy with how it turned out.
B007ACWH2U|2|This blouse is cute, however the fit is awkward. I have ordered TR blouses in the past with no issues. There was a lot of openness on the sides which wood require a tank style under garment. Going down a size doesn't fix this issue.  The item was returned
B00D3F7DFY|5|I love Kensie dresses! They are usually very well made and beautiful! This dress is no exception! Soft, and beautiful! I'm so proud of this dress!
B000C4ZG9E|5|Great buy for socks!
B00MOMGR0E|5|I love these socks! They're just opaque enough to be socks, not hose, but they're so bright and chic, especially with black slacks, a black blazer and a white top.
B00JR9CQF2|5|I love it...
B0002TOXDE|5|I have worn gold toe socks since I was old enough to make my own decision about what to buy and wear. During my 40 years as a business exec knee length black gold toes were part of my daily uniform. In those days we all wore suits to work. Now I wear shorter socks but still stick with the gold toe quality.
B00LJVLU0I|5|beautiful
B00K3FQEIE|2|I sent it back, was not what I was expecting.
B007SOMDY2|5|Gorgeous, beautiful quality, design, enhance my figure you do not need a bra it has support and is adjustable, love the light blue color will order a different color too thank you!
B00OXSH2HY|5|Came as expected
B00SVI9VNK|5|I love the outfit & fit as expected. Go by weight not by how old they are.
B00A6VG09S|5|I got this for my husband as a birthday gift.I so want one for me. It's much better than I thought it was going to be.The picture doesn't do it justice at all. The die hard James Bond fan should have one.
B00KQMLTA2|5|For my daughter who was looking for a maternity tank top. She says it fit true to size and is very comfortable. It holds up her tummy but is not constricting. She wants
B006ZBZXO6|5|This is just absolutely beautiful. I love the color. It's so long and soft and comfortable. Thanks so much. :)
B001EH9OWS|5|A+
B00J064V9G|5|Great coat, but runs big. Returning mine for a smaller size.
B00BCK0VU6|5|Fit perfectly! Way cute!
B00OTRLGVC|3|It is a blt longer than what I expected based on the size chart. Just okay for your wearing at home.
B00CHSEB3K|4|Only problem is that the material is very thin.  Had not planned to wear a lot under it but must to so.
B00GPTFJVA|1|Uncomfortable, not what one would be looking for. Not recommended.
B003B9ESBY|4|The leg warmers were great for my 80s halloween costume.  They were a great stretchy-ness and fit exactly like the picture shows. They were alittle longer then I thought they would be, but they are supposed to be scrunched down.  They are also brighter yellow than the picture shows.  It is a yellow that is like the highway workers vests. ha  but it did ok for the halloween costume.
B00DG8V7PU|4|Difficult to put on.  The legs broke.  Pretty cool looking though.  I would still recommend.  My boss wore it and everyone went nuts.
B005CJ2TN0|4|Everything is Great.
B00EC9UUX2|1|I ordered a 42B, there is no way this is a 42B.  It was extremely tight and the straps are very small.  Disappointed...
B00DD29GGG|5|great blouse.
B00R49AW94|5|Great quality.  No zipper or button on pants.
B00BUZAZJK|1|My grand daughter usually wears a med, the bottom of this suit is so small, it is awful, she can not wear it out, she'd be arrested in my opinion. We were very disappointed.
B00MK2FH18|4|I love the way this looks on me but I wouldn't be able to gain 2 pounds, I'm 5'1 & 143
B00CSAWR9M|2|Too Small
B00JXE2CIW|5|Great quality and promp delivery, however the size runs large. I had to return and order a smaller size.
B00A7TMA9S|5|The pants are comfortable and have lots of pockets. They do have an elastic waist band and draw string so they stay up well. I have gotten many complements on these scrubs. My only complaint would be that there is a seam that runs right on my knee cap which can be distracting at times. I would buy these again though.
B00CDZMZOE|2|The dress itself is cute but it is NOT one size fits all.  I am 5'6, ~140 lbs, usually size 10-12.  The top was extremely tight and the skirt hit at my knee, not calf.  It says it fits up to size 16 but Im not sure if they are using a different scale (children?)  I ordered another dress from them (different style), fit better but still tight as a L/XL.  I know I need to lose a few pounds but I am by no means overweight.  If you are built like the model I think the dress will look great.  If you are built like an average women (not even large) then you may be disappointed.
B00PSBZN44|5|In true Jessica Simpson style this top is really cute. The picture doesn't even do it justice. The bottom blue stripe is nylon which makes the whole thing very feminine. The back is longer in length than the front and the top is thin and it is kinda see-through because of its light weight. I like that it's thin and light weight.  I wore a white cami under it.
B00I0RPCRG|5|This is the second of these I have ordered.  Just the right weight of fabric, and I like the short sleeves.  Washes and dries very well…..very pleased.
B00126362K|5|Great fit and nice material
B004X07F56|5|Great tie ,will wear it at my grand daughters wedding on the 4th of October. Love vivid colors in tie.<br />.
B00NUICMFA|4|The colors are intense and they fit well and are warm.  I had to wash them a number of times in Oxyclean and rinse with vinegar to get the smell out of them.
B005FE2EE6|4|Paid $230 plus shipping for it on here and I am happy.  If I would have spent $999-$1299 I would not be happy at all.  Heck if I would have spent more than $400-500 I would probably still not be happy.  I watched these for months waiting for one to list at a good price after reading the reviews.  I never intend to wear it and put it on a mannequin for display in that respect it looks great.  It is a Rubies costume so they cut many corners on thickness of materials and were not the most careful with the glue and paint, but with some fixing up I was very happy with it.  Just watch for one to list at a good price.  Also I agree with an earlier review there should really be a place where you can use a bathroom instead of having to disrobe.
B004CZXDF8|5|This nightgown is gorgeous, but the size large was a little... large. I contacted them and the process of trading it in for a med was super easy and fast, with prompt 'real human' responses from one of their CS people on the other end of the email. And the new one fits perfect! :)
B00CDID50O|4|its looks very neat.comfortable
B00IWJG5RI|5|Perfect
B00JXIX7N2|4|I am 170cm tall, 34&#34;-26&#34;-37&#34;. t is very comfortable and colour is the same as image.
B001JPH6XE|4|Definitely Knee length
B000HT6F5S|5|My husband had bought these pants at Sams Club and they no longer carry them. We ordered them and received them right away. We purchased 2 sizes and one did not fit but, we were able to exchange them with no problem at all. We will definitely order from this company again.
B0070TORDA|4|He loved it.
B007JEHD5A|5|I put this on my wife and she did not look like the girl in the picture.  Oh well.  She looked cute anyways!  My only complaint is it took a long time from China.  I didn't realize it was coming from China when I got it.  Missed Halloween.
B00A17JYVI|4|Does its job.  My husband is somewhere between a small-medium, and the medium was sufficient, perhaps a little large after wearing a few times.  He says they're &#34;comfortable enough,&#34; but he's still not interested in wearing them other than, well, out of necessity.
B004FKLNC0|5|perfect fit quick delivery
B00L5HJUF8|2|the pants are true size but the shirt is bigger than it should be. Also  I got an item that had the tags cut off. Usualy they do that in stores when the item has factory problems and it had been return by another buyer previously.<br /><br />The colors are nice and it is cute and comfortable.
B00BVJ7UDE|5|Love this on my wife and she enjoys wearing it, says it fits and feels great, all I can say is it looks great!
B00ET1V41A|4|I ordered size 7 in these and they fit very nice but the only thing is, one of then came in size 9 so i had to give it to my mom, they need to make sure when their packing these items, the right sizes are in the pack, not bad otherwise.
B00931VPYM|5|Love it
B00BXOBYIY|5|This is the perfect coin purse!
B00BKYCMWE|5|Cool swimsuit, but a little too long. It is a slightly-above-the-knee length. Guts nicely at the waist, the elastic ensures it doesn't fall down, but too big for my little boy to play/run in on be beach.
B00DVGIDYA|4|I liked how it fit, im gonna cut the bottom a lil and make it shorter, but I loved it :)
B00J3Y9CGC|5|Like the belt just to small still fits though
B00945C8QQ|2|This was amazing for about 2 weeks then it ripped. I read the sizing chart and ordered accordingly. I had worn them maybe 6 times.
B00EPO9EFY|3|fell apart and clasp broke on. strap
B0059DVCXM|4|Fit well. Very warm.
B00FOJ6CNQ|5|Love love it !
B00KIL2YPA|1|It fit loosely and it was too short for me and i'm only 5'-6&#34; tall.
B00JXMAL3C|5|It is cuter than I expected.  I love the penquins and trees.  My husband liked it to.  It fit perfectly.  It was comfortable.  I am sure it will be snuggly when the cold weather returns.
B003UW0SJI|1|not good the fabric is way to thin to actually use as a tissue
B00F9T70LE|5|These pants are very nice, they fit me as a size 14 with a larger tummy and are very comfortable.  They seem substantial and well made.
B00AMB01J2|5|I purchased this darling outfit fir my daughters reborn doll. It is really pretty, well made, and looks beautiful! You will love it!!
B001102BOQ|5|It's great to find pleated jeans with a relaxed waistband. They are very comfortable, but look a little less casual than ordinary jeans -- perfect for a retiree like me.
B00L5QGOT4|5|Another one because I love squirrels. I didn't have anything warm, so I got this. It's nice and soft on the inside (at least for now because it's new). I hope it will stay that way for a while.
B00EFSZ3GY|5|I normally wear a 31 waist in regular non raw denim and seeing how it's not my first pair of raw denim I purchased a 29 and 30 and i perfer the 29 for a skinnier/slimmer fit and the 30 for a more relaxed baggy fit, (I hate belts so I didn't get true to size) great quality denim for a good price.. If you aren't aware with raw denim it's recomended to size down 1for the stretching on these specific nudies. After breaking them in they will stretch a bit
B00FYNDGCM|5|Excellent purchase, the outfit is beautiful. The fit is perfect !<br />I don't gave even one complaint.<br />Washing and drying with no shrinkage<br />Colors stay vibrant, she looks so cute with many compliments of her clothing<br />I can't get better deals on Nautica Clothing, Very Satisfied customer right here!
B007MO5HKK|5|I am so happy that I bought these. They fit perfect. Wonderful support and really look cute on. You need these.
B0008JFAIK|5|I'm not sure, but these may still be made in the US, I hope so.  Remember when jeans were stiff and thick when brand new and you had to wear them in?  That's how these are....like, real, man.
B006P0MD04|2|This is a cute shirt but it seems to run a lot smaller than usual.  I'm sure when it shrinks in the laundry it will be too small for our granddaughter.  Disappointing since the same size in a Rashguqrd shirt from Kohl's is much roomier.
B005ESMBLE|5|This dress was such a hit. I was blown away by how great of quality it was!!! Super soft jersey material, Strechy and form fitting to hugs all your curves in just the right places. Runs True to size. My husband loved this so much on me that he ordered the T shirt for himself and talked our friends into dressing up as ninja turtles as well.<br /><br />I wore this for one night of a Halloween festival. I actually had to fly straight to the festival and drive there so I wanted something I could wear on a plane as well . Perfect add leggings and remove when I get to the venue!!! I was so comfortable all night!!
B00RXZVFAY|4|Great suit. My husband got it to wear to a wedding. As it is slim fit, he went up from his usual size 40L to 42R and it fits him great. Very flattering.
B0059X31XQ|2|I really wanted to love these jeans, but the fit was all wrong.  They are VERY low waisted, which is fine if you are a teenager, but not flattering for a 30 year old, in my opinion at least. The length was perfect, I'm 5'1 and they were perfect with low heel/wedged shoes.
B004WPHMJQ|5|Very happy with is!
B00B6CQU96|2|First day of wearing these, I loved the looked of them. I thought they were very sexy on. However, later on in the day they started to fit very uncomfortable on your lady parts. I would not recommend this item. They are a waste of money.
B0075YNO02|5|This is a high quality art piece and I am enjoying wearing it very much. I appreciate the fine care in shipping too.
B00FL9B0CW|5|Very pretty dress. Great for nights out on the town.
B000XZ6XZS|5|Used it for a cosplay, worked out well. It fits as advertised. Its a worth while investment. Just buy it already.
B00GRJ1Q56|4|it  is not made in USA
B00HEUXCT0|5|NICE!!
B003CMMLZK|5|It organizes all my cards great! But it should only be for people who don't have a ton of the little cards as it has a limit on what you can fit! But I have about 12 and it works great for them.
B00UU0VDK6|5|Lifts nicely
B00FWQPSZ4|3|Looks amazing but a little small on my fiance
B00CKLI3OC|2|These run small.  I ordered a large and I'm not a huge person and it does not fit like the picture more like a Henley shirt.
B0083F8TPC|5|Since receiving this top, I've worn it twice and have decided it's now my favorite. The shape is quite flattering and I love the extra long sleeves. They are fitted at the wrist and this is such a pretty detail. When ordering this item, I accidentally ordered two of the same top. I contacted PattyBoutik by email and was pleased to receive a response within the hour! The person who contacted me was so helpful and accommodating and was able to solve the issue without delay. After emailing my new choice, once again I received a response within the hour.  I am extremely impressed with the professionalism shown by PattyBoutik and the tops I received are all beautiful!
B003YD3J30|1|terrible costume. So cheap that nobody understood who I was trying to be. too much glitter for Robin Hood
B006SRTFGY|5|Did the trick as an extra layer in Norway.
B00KYRA2I4|5|Bought these for my husband for when he works out and they are by far the best out of the numerous he has tried.  Great for lifting and doesn't budge.
B00WJMJE9A|4|Product runs a little small but it stretches. did not expect pockets either. But nice dress and delivered much quicker than I expected coming from China.
B000N8X740|5|Comfortable fit
B00G9BBP7Q|5|good quality, fits well, looks great with leggings. perfect for an ugly sweater party!
B0030IMYVC|5|As described shipped fast
B00CPJ07UM|4|I like the fit of these pants.  I got a small.  My waist is 27&#34; not sucking in and hips 33&#34; and I am 5'2&#34; tall.  The only thing is if I am having a bloated day or put on five pounds, and it's hot out, they look really see through.  They are as sheer as the picture on a skinny day but I wish I got a bigger size because they look gross when they stick to my body.  But they are good incentive to watch your diet.
B00PK3LEQG|5|Nice scarf. Warm
B00OFHM37W|5|Cute but short in length and overall too small.
B00I3D1EF6|4|Excellent fit
B0007YXTPC|2|My first no wire bra,  was tired of being poked and pinched by underwires. Read the reviews on this one, I wad very hopeful!  I have large breasts. 42 D.  Not perky anymore!  I was hoping for support as the reviews stated. But. Unfortunately, No. The back strap rides up with the wright of breast.  The band cuts into you and rolls up.  So I'm not a fan, not sure if there is a wireless bra out there that fits and us comfortable for large breasted women!  Anybody with advice would be soo appreciated!  Not looking for glamour, just comfort that hold the girls in place comfortably!
B004Q20DP0|5|I like these cufflinks a great deal because they never get caught on anything.  They're also great for musicians because they don't scratch up my instrument while I perform.  I've gotten many compliments about them over the last couple years that I've had them.  The only complaint that I have is that the can unravel after about a year.
B00422M6FY|5|THANKS
B00EPQ8DPE|5|Quality shirt with a great feel and for a price that I love! Ordered these for my twins for our Disney trip and saved myself a lot of time and money searching for one down there. I can honestly say, I liked THIS shirt better than any I saw in the Park. Good buy!
B00PNE1U8O|1|Shirt runs very small.  Should be labeled as 12 months.  Very disappointed.
B00CAA1RG4|5|I really like this costume. It fit like I expected it too
B005OG3VKG|5|These are great.  Hold all hair types.  Would not use any other hair ties.  Would definitely buy again and recommend .
B008SE2IGE|5|This is a good product I recommend this packs to everyone you save money on theses packs and usefull .
B0009VEB1O|5|Pros - This hat met all summer needs. I ride and can roll this up, stuff it in my saddlebags and it still looks great when I put it on my head. Mesh helps keep my head cool. Very soft to wear - soft inner headband.<br /><br />Cons - Not so great when the weather turns cool because of the mesh BUT IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE.
B00HLRPQZO|3|My son loves it!!!
B004SW9N9A|5|I do love the Bib Overall I purchased.  I would recommend this product to a friend and would purchase again.
B00HDEL5W8|5|Great price and fast shipping. Delivery was two days ahead. Awesome
B00D5V180W|5|Very well made and the leather is soft.  The wristlet can be worn on the wrist or cross body and has plenty of room
B00KDJK2BA|5|I must say I love it. everything is perfect, love the color
B00DVIOKLI|4|100% cotton, super soft t shirt, and adorable shorts. I'm not sure why the other reviewer thought this was cheap feeling as I believe it's top quality. There are a couple other short/t sets by splendid that are not 100% cotton and feel cheap though.
B00DY3L2PC|4|The only thing is I wish the front had a stitch or two because without pulling and wraping around the straps super tightly, my boobs look weird and far apart. I'm a 36 C or D usually and not skinny skinny and when I pull the straps around tight so I have good cleavage, skin kind of pops out. But other than that the Large fit me well.  I didn't try on the bottoms cause I'd wear different ones.
B00F13N9L8|1|It was to small even thou we picked the right size. The sleeves and sweater itself is very small and it was the largest size that they had.
B00FGJFCRG|1|very shiny texture.  I was hoping for a more cotton look.  I feel like I can't wear them unless it's under a skirt or a long shirt. disappointed.
B00ODXWK9Y|4|I like the dress but it says size 9/10 and it fits maybe an adult size 2. Cut very small
B00A72P13M|5|Love these tights! Lightweight, breathable material. I've worn them for 5 days, no problem with runs or holes as of yet. I purchased black, which is a nice matte black-black material (not which should be attempted to be worn as pants, as it's still a little sheer). Works great under skirts and dresses, even on warm days. I got these to attempt staving off varicose veins in my 5th pregnancy. Even if unsuccessful (hard to know if it's &#34;working&#34; yet at only 20 weeks) in that department, these are still cute and comfortable, particularly nice with the ever shorter maternity wear styles.
B003B2ZJDW|5|Bought for my son to wear for work. He loves them. They look and fit great.
B00EKYLO7A|5|Darling shirt for new big sister!
B00FA90MZE|5|Fast delivery,  looks great.  Fits perfect.
B008APTS8M|2|The Item was delivered on time, the fabric of it its different from the one I saw in the picture, it has a texture. and the size doesn't fit too well, the color is beautiful!
B005AXW0G4|4|Bought it for an Angel Halloween costume. I'm about 5'2, with an hourglass body so buying a tutu to cover my behind was difficult.<br />This tutu was short and covered about 2/3 of my behind. I had to wear white shorts definitely but overall I am satisfied with how it all turned out.
B009D8HV0W|1|I ordered this size as XS. i am a small guy, I know what a true xs is, when it fits and when it doesnt. I continually order clothes from this design. the small was too big and the xs is too big. the most important feature of a shirt is if it fits right. this failed :-(
B00EB11XZU|5|Very cute...fit great...
B00EFEPHO6|4|It's a little shear, but I like the fit and plan to order more in different colors.
B005HI8ODK|1|I choose a 4 x with the expectation that it would be loose and roomy.  This s*** is smaller and tighter than most 2x shirts I owne. The fabric is very nice I just wish the size was at least close to the marked 4x.
B00PVXS7BK|4|I love PattyBoutik. They tend to run small in their sizes so I know to upsize. As always the style is on point. I love the look. The fabric is soft and comfortable to the touch. It's been through a couple of washes and has not shrunk or faded. (yes, it can be put into the dryer.)
B00FBD2G0I|5|Just what I needed.
B00SHUD02U|2|This product is very small fitting. I'm a bigger guy. I wear XL but this shirt fit like a medium
B007IJ5NP8|5|I liked these jeans so much i bought 2 pair . i ordered another pair today. They fit great . love everything about them.
B00JFA7HSE|4|Good stretch, bright colors, can't complain. Exactly as expected :)
B00EF56UJQ|4|Wears very well.
B00EXES57Y|1|Will NEVER buy these again.  Flimsy fabric, made for women with a B cup or smaller.  DO NOT BUY if you have a C cup or bigger.  They will NOT fit, I got the Large and it was 2 sizes too small for my 34Cs.  I would have returned them but it was more hassle than it was worth, so I gave them to my roommate who has a smaller B cup and they fit her perfectly.
B008PZCP0A|5|Nice pair of black Calvin Klein jeans. They have some stretch, so they're comfortable. They fit well and look good. Great price too!
B009GXDG9E|5|These are great for wool socks and very warm.  They pill but not as bad as the ones I have from REI.  They are not too thick and not too thin so they are comfortable with all my closed shoes.
B005XHXPBG|1|They ripped apart after one wash in a very gentle cycle! They are very poorly made and not meant for active children.
B0069JQSQQ|5|They are too cute! Finally a pretty diabetic socks. At first they looked narrow & I had my doubts. Then I tried them on & they fit Great!!' I am not diabetic. But I need socks that don't bind at top & these are great.
B00L1C0VZK|5|Great beanie. I want one in every color now!
B00R7SR72W|5|True to size. Very comfortable fabric. It hits below my knees, I'm about 5'3&#34;.
B00G0OMBZW|5|Great material, didn't expect the dice logo at the bottom of the shirt.
B00AJ2ST3O|5|These glasses are a really good quality! They are very well tinted, and durable !
B0059P8WCO|2|Fits but people can easily tell if it's cold out if your shirt isn't thick enough. I don't really wear it for this reason.
B00V81XWZU|5|My mother loves these socks! Good quality.
B001N1C8ZA|1|We were happy when our order arrived the day before Halloween. The costume was missing the red cape. We did not have time to find a UPS drop box and send back the costume and get a new one sent out. We had to attach one of our dish towels to make up for the missing cape. Our little superman still looked cute, just a little ghetto!
B00VE737XK|3|Somewhat small...
B00O8CE22S|5|Pretty but I decided on another Miusol dress and returned this one. This one has very pretty details though. Kinda wish I kept it for another occasion.
B0046VTA0A|5|My 53 year old son loved this shirt.  I guess we are back to the 70&#34;s.  I ordered it for him for Christmas.
B00076ZR3M|5|Got a black one, it does feel a bit synthetic but it's still feels alright. For working out or biking it's great.
B008H7M790|4|I saw other reviews and I bought a bigger size. It was the best thing to do. I bought the set for my son 1 year birthday party and following the recommendation of other customers I decided to buy size 24m for a 12m boy. It fit perfectly. Should I have bought 18 m it would have been small.
B00E709FS2|4|I'm 5'8\\". Nice fit (size L), nice color, nice quality, nice price, delivered on time. Pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Post Update: After the 1st washing, the 2 shirts that I purchased shrank quite a bit especially in the shoulder areas. I gave the tshirts to my grandson and will order again in the next higher size.
B0059LG6NK|4|the polo is a little small
B0090302EW|3|Want to like these pants. Made from good material, but the stitching is horrible. Both pairs that I bought now have holes in the crotch. Going back to my wranglers for work pants.
B004600BOK|1|The suit is well made and was delivered in a quick time, other than than, it does not look anything like this picture. The colors are off. The suit is orange with grey spots, not red and white. And the back of the suit does not match the picture - there is no skirt in the back. I have attempted to return the suit to a local Target store, as it said I could, but after 2 managers and 45 minutes later, was unable to return it. I guess I'll have to pay postage to send it back. Very disappointed.
B0081SER1G|4|My 2 year old likes these despite them being a little rough by my standards (as others said).  I came back and ordered more.  I got size 4T for a 2 year old 10 months of 36 lbs, a little taller than average.  I don't know if they shrunk in the wash because I didn't have him try them before washing.  Waist is not tight.  Length comes to half way down his thigh.
B003QP32FQ|5|Nice
B001H0FCDC|5|Simply put, nice glove and lovely blue color.  Someone tell me why navy gloves are so very difficult to find at a reasonable price especially in leather.  Perhaps Isotoner is better than leather.  I gave up look for leather and now very satisfied that I did.  I truly enjoy these.
B00UNKUS5E|5|Product arrived as seller promised.  Beautiful T Shirt.  It was purchased for a gift and the recipient loved it.  Thanks for offering such a great product!
B00DH3JLXY|1|Too long
B008LRR2QY|3|Faded the first time I washed it. Well made, fabric is ok. I use it under a blazer so it's not so bad but I wouldn't buy it again.
B00207Z5L0|5|This slip is wonderful. It fits and feels great and under summer dresses, it's just right.  Not to warm but just the right weight.
B00QRRKZ2S|2|Size from over sea never close what I ordered, US size XL . I did order XXL still like L US size.<br />Never order this again.. beside right price.
B00EVOO5MK|5|It looks great under clothing, no visible underwear lines, and holds up. Just what I need.
B00HSRZVC0|4|Wonderful design, well put together, but too small for me.  Fortunately they have great customer service and I was able to return the jacket with no hassle.
B002H9W0IC|5|This is the softest piece of clothing my granddaughters own.  You will not be disappointed.
B00W4VGWCI|2|Not at all like picture. Arms tight, short in torso. I ordered a size larger then normal and it is still too small. Disappointed. Fabric is also different then shown above.
B00MV95T72|5|My cats also love it TOO MUCH. If you have a cat hide the jacket.
B005LA74AI|5|The pants are made very well like all the Volcom clothing I have purchased so far.  The pants are a long on my son (he is short for his age) but they are slim enough to look nice gathered at his shoes.  My son hates dressing up and this is a good compromise for us.  Almost any color shirt looks nice with these pants.  I am glad I bought them.
B00M6J9D6K|2|the top was ok but the bottoms were way too small. Could only
B000H6DJ14|1|I'm tall and this isn't! Plus it shrinks hey look my bellybutton! Donated it to hopefully someone short. Do not recommend.
B0077I4OBY|5|I simply wanted cotton gym shorts for the summer for workouts or leisure and couldn't find them in the stores.  These arrived quickly and were sized perfectly.
B009VI1RF4|1|Small & not soft at all!
B00459OG1G|4|Met expectations.
B007IBCWTG|5|I like the shirt.  It's a gift for my boyfriend.  I washed and dried it inside out to see how it held up and it looks good.  Nice quality and I would recommend this shirt.
B00DWU5EME|2|I thought this was such an attractive dress that looked fresh and young...but it is far from it. The size was completely wrong. I am a standard size 8-10 but due to the reviews ordered a 14P just to be on the safe side...again, in &#34;normal&#34; sizes I am an 8-10. The 14P was skin tight on me. I felt terrible and it looked terrible. It did not look &#34;fresh and young&#34; it looked &#34;old and frumpy&#34; and I can honestly say it was NOT me because I have been losing weight and toning up for my upcoming wedding and have made other clothes purchases (size 8) so I know it was the dress. So if you do order this dress, don't let it make you feel bad about your size...it's not you...it's the dress. Fortunately, I was able to return it for a full refund since it was an Amazon Prime. Save yourself time, money and less stress.
B00D1R84HA|1|Too small unsatisfied
B00EVJS0HG|2|Quality is not good.  Tore a hole in them first day, by just pulling them on
B00VCEK9TA|4|Love these bras, very comfortable, like wearing nothing at all. No binding, no riding up. There is not a lot of support, but gives a smooth look with less jiggle. My one con would be the little triangular pad inserts which the tell you to remove before washing......pain to put back in. I washone with the pads in.
B00JRGIJEW|5|The product an the time were so excellent
B00BFZLICI|5|besides being very cute, it fits well, washes well, is very comfortable and both patients and non patients think that it brightens the enviroment i work in
B001M9EQEY|3|What we got is not what is in the picture. We ordered these once before and what we got WAS what was in the picture. The pictured shorts are better. What got this time will do but still not happy.<br /><br />5 stars for what is pictured<br />2 stars for what we got this order<br /><br />pen
B00JY6IEXQ|5|Perfect!
B00E1JM8WY|1|it is so small I could not get it on my arms.  And I did not know there were holes on the back.
B000V5MVSI|1|I was expecting a football type d ring belt, I was not happy with the clasp. I received by USPS 15 days after order date even though I am only 1 hour away from the company.    Best regards,  Mike
B00B6EAEU0|5|I got these pants for my son who needed a uniform type clothing. They are a durable fabric without being to corse on the skin.  We like them.
B00B4VGO7W|4|These cotton trader golf shirts are great.  The material is nice and soft and the colors are very nice.  I find the medium to be larger than most.  Since I tuck my shirt in when I golf I dont really mind, but I woulnt recommend using it untucked.  I am 6'2 and 200 pounds  for reference.  I have bought 3 more of these shirts and wish they had more colors available!
B00BMU3F72|1|I don't want this
B0045ZFDWG|5|I glad i ordered this skirt,it fits very well.I had to get it in a size bigger and its perfect...i cant wait til the weekend so i can wear it...:)
B00021NY2I|5|FIT  very good !!!  Like them !  Bought 2 !!!
B00K5B2LG0|5|Wonderful material and perfect size. I should be thanking my wife for selecting this dress for my daughters Birthday. It is really worth for its money.  Thank you for shipping the dress on time and received on time. I recommend and wish to shop more dress from your store/website.<br /><br />Thank you again for such beautiful dress design and material.
B0009GA77Q|2|My husband picked these out and was unhappy with the thin fabric, compared to his other Champion shorts that are heavier weight and have side seam pockets. We returned both pair.
B00CCO0DE0|5|They work for me....glad to have them.
B00EDZV1QK|4|I bought this to wear over a black tank top, and I really like it. The color is rich and it seems to be good quality (I haven't washed it yet). From the picture, I expected it to be a bit more cinched below the bust, but it's pretty loose throughout. I would've preferred a better fit at the waist, but I still like it.
B00H6VLN20|5|Super comfy and soft. Great fit
B00MA78WHO|5|I'm all about comfortable, sensible underwear. How are you supposed to go about your day being effective, confident and personable when your panties are literally in a bunch? Nay, I say. I don't truck with silly cute undies that necessitate learning the 19 ninja forms of the no-handed wedgie pick. I usually wear the Hanes cotton hipsters for the soft fabric and reliable fit. Those are totally great panties, but these blow them out of the water. Soft and breathable with the most fantastic fit, they're never anywhere but where they're supposed to be. These are my go to undies for the really taxing stuff like running bike errands, rollerskating and sitting through long movies. I can do my thing all day long without monitoring creepage and they're even soft enough to sleep in (sleeping in underwear is always on my not-to-do list). Bonus: they're not only a flattering fit, they're butchy as F and my girlfriend, who bought them for me (maybe they should call them 'girlfriend hipsters'?) loves to see me in them.
B00960X1WO|4|This is a great little dress for my granddaughter to wear when she wants to play dress up.  She and her sisters love to have tea parties and perform in their own plays and this dress is often worn during these events.
B007XT9UZC|2|The cups run very, very small, and the seams show through clothes quite a lot, which you wouldn't be able to tell from looking at the model. It's not a very practical bra.
B00ECG4RC0|5|I love these socks!  I am 44 but I'm into really cool socks for some reason.  These are adorable and well made.  My 21 year old daughter threatened to steal them from me!
B005PQEQLS|5|This is a fantastic pin.  I never really connected the concepts of recycling and karma before but they do reflect very similar ideas.  I love having these buttons to decorate jackets or bags with.  Great for starting a conversation too!
B00IT5QPIE|1|Item is small and the color was way different than in the picture
B00X3UF6IA|5|This dress was an excellent buy!
B00J6MZQ1Q|5|I love this dress! I  got a size 8, I  weigh 145lbs. It  fits a little too big, but it was my fault, I  ordered  up to be  safe. I rather it being  bigger  than too small. I will get it adjusted. The material  is  nice and the design  is unique. Love it :)
B00ENLEKL2|5|Took this bag with me all over Palestine for one month and its great. You can fit a lot of items within the middle part of the bag while having lots of smaller pockets for money, hair ties, and whatever you need. It's particularly great because the shoulder straps close up the *middle* zipper, so that no one would be able to yank open the zipper. Its a durable bag, would absolutely  recommend.
B00C628WXM|2|Both peices are way to small for me. The top hardly covers my breasts and the bottoms are so small that the are constantly showing my bottom crack...
B008GWU3TW|5|This is the perfect cap for anyone that wants a little color and really likes wearing caps or hats...Just put it on and go.  It is very comfortable and stylish...Love this product.
B00MNCXZ8C|5|Fit perfect & I loved it !
B00MS45BTG|5|Everything was great! It is very comfortable, the material is slightly thick, and it is not see-through. There is also a pocket on one side that can fit an iPhone6 with no problem. Also, I am 120lbs and had no issue with the length of the straps/ties being too short. The straps are sewn into the back of the pants and are non adjustable so I can see how that might be an issue for others. However, I really like this feature because the straps will stay put and will not slide around. The only other minor thing is the color is not quite as dark as pictured (not a huge difference) but it is still a very deep and beautiful color. Personally, I really love these pants and I would recommend them to others!
B00BEIL54W|5|Fits a little snug but it is a great dress....the material is not cheap...I need to iron the pleats flat but other than that I am very pleased! FYI this material does not give!
B00VEITY5O|5|It's perfect for the day my grandbaby will arrive I'll be ordering another because this one is way to big but it's so hard to shop online for myself! But I absolutely loved it! Not many things with the name GiGi 😊 thank you!!
B000J3RJDO|4|At first I was disappointed when I got it but once I tried it on I wasn't anymore. The quality of the product is bit low, but it does look good on! I'd say it is quite good for the price, after all it is pretty inexpensive, and it's not that you are going to be wearing it for a long time... ;)
B0057IO32G|5|I ordered the green boxers for my boyfriend as a random gift, and he loves them. he wears them so much i have to wash them for him all the time or he never would! He loves how comfortable they are. the size it true, though they are more baggy than the usual boxer. they are just the right size to fit under basketball shorts however so that doesnt matter. I will definitely be getting him more :)
B001H44TPA|5|My son really like the pants that I got for him he told me they fit good and they looked really nice, thank you and I'm pretty sure I will be buying more pants in the future, thank you.
B002KV7PSM|2|Title says 1/4 oz, picture shows 1 whole oz. Misled me to ordering wrong quantity. Pleae fix your picture.
B00FYZ74IC|5|This headpiece was perfect for the occasion and more than complimented my outfit. For those of you who don't particularly care to wear a hat this is the perfect head accessory. I love it!
B00M4M8KAE|5|Great shirt
B00520MZH4|5|I get a lot of compliments on it.
B00E1N94HW|5|Love these pajamas feel great and look great
B00AXFEJV8|5|Loved this lace jacket it completed my wedding dress it look great. I got so many compliments about it. I was verry happy with it at first whenbi ordered it I wasnt to sure about it but when I got it inbthe mail I was super hapy its totally worth the price. If I ever get married again ;) I will keep this shop in mind.
B000NRRQFW|5|I saw this and fell in love!!!!! But when it arrived it was way better than the picture! I adore the chains and the skulls, goes great with pants, shorts or my jean skirt, a MUST have for me, You too probally!!!!
B00S3JCRTM|5|Loved the material, Super Fast Shipping!Thank You.
B00OEYYY28|5|Love it! Speed of shipment perfect!
B00LOT2F5Y|5|excellent
B00L2JXUJG|1|My son fits everything size 3t he will be three the end of the month, these trunks are way too big and they can not be tightened.
B00F9B5K1E|5|Got me through another wedding.  I'd say it works great.
B00HS0LLSA|5|These leg warmers kept my legs so warm! I'm very pleased.
B00HC17QTS|4|Such a cute purse. It is too small, which it the only reason I sent it back. Real leather. Good quality. The measurements seemed to be good enough, except I had to stragetically place all the contents. Not fun when you are rushing out of a store......
B00422M6FY|3|if u put more then 3 credit cards in here u cant close it all the way. let alone some cash
B00JH9Q7LQ|5|ok
B00B8NGVMO|5|No complaints. Its good quality and will last long. I love this. And the colors are very nice. This is great.
B00BBT3S2Q|4|Super nice fit, but found with extended wear, say walking around all day, my legs end up with blue streaks.  No biggie, but don't wash these with light colors!
B00HA3DB9C|5|This pair of jeans has been a perfect fit and a welcome addition to my wardrobe! I will definitely consider buying them again in the future. Also, I initially ordered a wrong size, and had to return the pair... this was a painless process!
B001B9XI3A|3|I purchased this tie for a \\"memorable movie\\" fundraiser.  Our team selected the Blues Brothers movie.  The tie was great for the costume/event.  Easy to work with, good quality, nice product.
B00D1I77FO|5|Love this it's so cute
B00BV2RE00|4|A little bit short but could still have been a bit larger
B004VGASQA|3|Shrank a little bit more then expected.
B007AITW8G|5|Love this product. I really like the design and how it fits and it's a really good price. the quality is good, I had a pair before this one that ripped but that was only because I fell :).
B00MPWFSTE|5|These Mickey Mouse cotton PJs are sooo sweet and Grandson is a big fan of Mickey!  So this set is among his favorites.  We are very happy with these pajamas and their quality!  Recommended!
B00H2SEM4S|5|These socks were delivered as expected. They're warm, soft, fit well, and rarely fall down. I've been wearing them around the house and they're very comfortable, though one is starting to get a bit of a hole.
B00PEWCKJI|5|Lovely, light weight infinity scarf. Beautiful bright teal color and nice enough to dress up and shirt or sweater!
B00A2UOMDE|5|perfect item.
B0013GA2EY|5|Nice shirt. True to size, flattered on. No complaints.
B00I03ER1M|5|For the price, this is an excellent buy!  Such cute details and lightweight material.
B00JAWCZ5W|5|Gorgeous, good quality and well made, would buy again.
B005YEVVHI|5|For the price I didn't expect a lot beyond a basic product. What I got far exceeded my expectations. This wallet came packaged very nicely in a retail package. The msrp was $40.00. I wouldn't have paid that much but it definitely looks like they could've charged that much. The leather smells great, it's well constructed and much heavier than I expected. Great buy.
B002D44O4E|2|My son had a pair of these pants we found at a secondhand store, and they were his favorite uniform pants, so I ordered a few more pairs from Amazon. However, the secondhand pants had knee patches n the inside (it isn't completely clear whether they are reinforced knees that were part of an earlier design of the pants or were added by the previous owner). These didn't. Within a few weeks, every pair had holes in the knees. I'm making them into shorts.<br /><br />If you're willing to reinforce the knees yourself, these may work. Otherwise, I'd spend a little more and get something that will last for more than a half-dozen wearings.
B00E0SZUCG|3|I was just too lazy to go to stores to look for something like that... What's good about itis that it was delivered very quick, i got it right on time.
B00971O5XG|5|Great quality shirt got for easter along with bow tie they both came in time
B00JO9ZUN0|5|You can tell its hand made and you can see my<br />d📍ck and balls through the fabric
B00KBJPAZ0|2|too small had to order large
B009E8MQAQ|4|These were true to the description and photo. We got her a size 16, and they fit slightly loose but not overly big on her so I would say they are true to size as well. Decently made for the price. Will buy this brand again.
B008OE595K|5|i got the large and its alittle tight but i still love the gloves  they are very classy looking gloves
B00MPTG2EM|5|Just love the colour and it fits perfectly and can't wait to wear it when the weather cools down here and I might even wear it for Christmas.<br />Cheers, Flo
B005MSG6VM|2|1. The cell phone test worked with some phones and not with others that I had tested, done at the same location.  So it's hard to say how reliable the claims of this product really are.  Maybe using it would be better than using nothing but I wouldn't completely trust its effectiveness.<br />2. Not true to size:  I selected the size according to the chart provided and it was too tight. I was only in my first trimester when I tried it on.<br />3. For the above two reasons, the price point of this product is unreasonable.
B00QEUL80Q|5|Looks gorgeous on.  With or without a petticoat.
B0091VM6R4|1|I am a larger guy who is 5' 9&#34;.  I found this shirt to be about right in width, but way too long.  Even though I ordered the big version, it seems like I got a tall version of the shirt.  The sleeves were okay, but the collar was abnormally loose on me.
B000AA2YK4|5|This was a great company to deal with . They kept me informed about my order from the time they received it to the day it was shipped. The pants are very light weight and soft my husband loved them. Donna
B0039824FO|5|We love these stay-on socks. No use to buy other kick-off brands!
B00AH4XW5O|5|HI, THIS IS MY REVIEW ON THIS DEEP FLORAL WRAP AROUND FASHION SKIRT.  I LIKE THE STYLE AND THE COLORS, AND IT JUST FITS PERFECTLY WELL ON MY BODY.  AND I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS.  AND I WILL GIVE THIS REVIEW A 5-STAR RATING.<br /><br />THANKS,<br />MARLA H
B00KA8NBTY|5|I am 5'2, 125lbs. I got the size small and it fits great. I probably need to do some more lunges to fill out the bottoms more (my ass is on the smaller side), but I love it. It's super sexy without being too revealing.
B00I92WL6C|3|Very handsome. Well made. Bummer that it DOES NOT have a draw string / cinch able waist. Waist is too big for my slim boy.
B00LRHCKGC|4|get one size larger than you actually need.  trust me
B002AWCXRE|5|Great costume.  My daughter wore it to school and trick or treating and did not complain about it being uncomfortable at all!
B00A3Q0CKE|4|My son really likes this shirt, especially the bright colors.
B004P1IMCI|5|I Love Love Love these shorts they fit great and dry very quickly.  I just bought a pair of navy ones and I have had the black ones for about 3 years and they have never lost their color.
B006NU7GA8|5|It fit my daughter beautifully. She wore it the very night she was to sing in a concert at school. She looked great!
B002DGMZGG|5|I bought this shawl for my elderly mom, who broke ribs and was having trouble putting her sweater on/off.  The shawl is very lightweight for spring/summer use, and was easy for her to push on or off.  It is long enough to wrap or knot, but not too long to get in the way.  It has a nice sheen and the color (light pink) was just as described.  It was a nice addition for a good price. I am considering buying a couple for myself!
B00504YC8M|5|sincerely i dont know why i ordered this color (bluish grey)if i saw better ones, but when i received and wear this tie i loved its color and its quality.
B000HEAS4M|2|They run very small order 2 sizes larger
B00D3REUAS|5|Love these for under the sleepsack at night.  They are the ONLY ones we have found that don't crunch baby's toes.  They are incredibly soft, hold up well, and are cute as a bonus!  We bought this size at 4 months because baby was 18lbs and 27&#34; long, they fit great and I think will last for another two months or so depending on how he grows.
B00BSEV8MQ|5|Fits perfectly and made the best present!!:) the material is very comfortable as well!!
B00D3UDXXK|4|Color Bright Rose was not as seen as on my computer screen. In the product photo, there is a piece cotton through front zipper head, but not in real product. I guess these product photos are not the latest. In Columbia official site, it looks more like what I get.
B00YHEUR9E|5|I purchased these for my seven month old chunky baby. There is some room in the length, but they fit snug around the thighs and waist. I am glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a size up (12-18 mos). I just ordered a few more pairs!
B00JWQLMBY|4|I like
B002ZAPJXG|5|Great cheap gloves, they fit very well and I actually used them for my Halloween costume
B005L8HKVI|4|It is a little on the smaller side.
B00HNLTANW|3|Very short, and see through
B005BYVN1A|5|Very good quality. This is exactly what I was looking for.
B00EJSNB4G|5|I was so happy when I got it. Would buy from these people again. Let everyone know your emergency plan wit this nice button.
B00BZDY2G4|5|It fits perfectly!  And I love it!  I would order it again for sure.
B00M3AO3A8|5|My dad wears a 2X size pajama pants and it is hard to find ones that fit properly without being too wide and baggy. These fit my dad perfectly, and are his favorite pattern.
B000WIB33I|3|Very cute idea with the LED lights twinkling but it is really stiff, uncomfortable material and I cant get my daughter to actually wear it.  I guess it depends on your kid and their comfort with various materials.  The battery pack is in the bodice and it is quite intrusive.  Not a very practical idea.
B009Y9QBYW|5|Big fan o f wool socks.  I find them to be better at keeping my feet dry in the summer and warm in the winter.  These are very nice socks for this price point.
B00CP3M7S8|5|Cute and adorable. Difficult to get my daughter to not wear it all the time.  It is a lil scratchy on some of the Inside seams but a tight shirt and leggings helps.
B00S9ODK56|4|Costume is as stated. Wished I would have noted the front part is sheer. No worries since I'm wearing a cami under for warmth anyways. Very cute
B009Y9QCCS|5|Great socks, they stay up very well.
B009S0K1JS|3|Good deal
B00DUFRF8M|5|My daughter loved these pants, and they fit her nice.
B000N4VPUM|4|The product I got is exactly what the ad made it to look like, and it arrived a couple of days before the scheduled delivery date.
B00B1WPH2C|1|Don't waste your money this item is real cheap wore it once and its coming apart.
B00JVHPI82|4|Super cute dress, but not great if you have a large chest. There's not much room in that shelf!
B00I4SYR2C|5|Volcom uses great material and this fits perfectly. Volvom is a consistently a slim fit (I was hoping for that); it looks and feels great.
B00J3B0OOO|4|I really like these pants but wish I had gotten a larger size.  They are a little more snug than my other brands that I purchased the same size in.  But I do like them.
B003XRR08M|5|Just love It. Used it all last winter. Kept my head toasty warm
B006TG7LH4|5|This shirt is fantastic!
B009ZSMKC4|5|I really like this, the fabric is soft and the legs are long enough to cover the knees which is nice for crawlers. My 10 month old is very very tall so he's already wearing some 18 month clothes which are a little big but with his height and the cloth diapers that's necessary. Anyway, its nice to have something that provides a little more length.
B008GU3XUK|2|They are too loose and too thick. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because of the cute design.
B000UANUPW|3|This Gel bra is not very enhancing more like squish you inwards so still flat looking with cleavage and makes you feel like you will spill out at any given moment
B00V0GEHXY|4|DID NOT REALIZE IT HAD A SLIDE HOOK IN THE FRONT.  I PREFER THE BACK THAT IS ADJUSTABLE.
B0077QGOTG|5|As advertised and it is quality material.
B00JAB0HBC|2|It comes down to my chest it's so big . some say it's not itchy . It's arclyic , IT'S Itchy. I can not find any hats made with cotton . I bought this for the low price and the brand on reliability  . will have to do for now.
B00GJOJOGC|5|exelente
B000N8X2FO|5|I've been wearing these in light colors as warm weather work pants for quite some time. They are much cooler than jeans and wear just about as well. Dickies always run a little on the snug side, so take that into account.
B00JTFRWY4|5|The fabric is soft and conforms to my body perfectly.  I was a little worried about the length being too long but because the fabric clings to you, it doesn't look ugly...instead it looks sexy and classy!<br /><br />Thank you for this and i will be buying another in a different color!
B000A399YA|5|Nice
B00G0JDTAS|5|It was amazing! Top class! It came on time! I would totally tell my friends about this!!!!keep up the good job.
B00PHQLA8I|5|Adorable especially for the cost!
B007ILH16K|4|This shirt is very cute and fits nicely. I would say the color is less burgundy than shown and more in the hot pinks area, but it still looks great. The empire panel covers the openings for nursing and conceals the breast well enough, however I am more partial to the opening style in other empire shirts like the ones from Motherwear, which is smaller and to the sides instead of all the chest area. It does the job, though, and the making is good quality. Would recommend and buy again if they had other colors!
B004GCIMZS|5|I love this bra! The fit is comfortable and has great support for moderate to heavy cardio (running, volleyball, etc.).
B008GULYU6|5|Great color and perfect fit. I'm 5'4 , 120lb and this t-shirt fits just right in small. I liked it so much I've bought 2 more.
B00PKOWSNS|5|I am 5 11 very tall and a thicker girl. The leggings are perfect. They strech well and he material is so soft. They do not show thru but onthe side of my hip you could see my underwear. But who cares! Cant see my butt im not worried!
B00T6KR5T4|2|they are a litte big they do not say the size on them they say free for the size the tags are held on by pink thred that u cant get out so i the middle of all of them realy NOT HAPPY ABOUT THESE i buy them for my wife
B003VQQYDM|3|A little small!!+
B003E00TN6|2|I really love the fit of this bra, but it is not at all durable for the price. The underwire has snapped in both of the bras I bought. It's hard to find anything good in a large cup size, but I'm not going to keep throwing away money on these either. If you can afford to replace them every other month, go for it!
B009GJNM7Y|4|Great..
B00FF9D7T2|2|Small and cheaply made. This is okay if you are a 12 year old boy. Otherwise, not recommended. Served the purpose though. Once use and into the bin it went.
B00J4W3624|4|I bought this outfit for work. I usually do not wear Plus sizes. However, I was going for a &#34;baggy' look with a pencil skirt. I am usually a size 9 or 10; 5'3&#34; so I was expecting a bigger size. One thing I did not expect, there are cut-outs for the shoulder, so for me it was a bit revealing for work. Other than that, I was happy with the shirt.
B0026P46PC|5|Excellent fit.  Just the right amount of coverage under the arm and across the bust.  Very secure feeling unlike some more expensive bras that don't control the jiggle.  Bought two for myself and two for my daughter the beige is a beautiful color.
B00MQTDKGO|4|Bought it for my wife who wears a 16 and the 2x fit perfectly
B00EBYIUSA|1|I love leggings and live in them during the winter and fall months these where so see through you could see my butt crack!!
B00TH14Y0K|3|Color lighter than what's shown in the pic
B00A7QUD72|5|These are awesome. I'm a tall skinny guy and undershirts have always fit poorly until now.
B002QREFKG|5|nice
B008RBSLNM|5|Excellent material and made well.  Very comfortable, too.
B00EMG3VO0|4|My 4 month old is too small for Carter 6 month sleep & plays but too big for 3 month ones, and these Gerber 3-6 month sleep & plays fit our in-between size needs.  However, the Gerber packaging included a lot of tape directly on the sleep & plays that left adhesive on the fabric that is hard to get off.  Doesn't affect the functionality of the outfits, but annoying.
B007VIYW1M|2|sent back
B00FBD2G2Q|4|They're socks;  nothing to get excited about but they fit and wear well.
B00DLU9EGC|5|nice, but too small.  I was well pleased with the transactions.
B00AHTK4VY|3|Kinda floppy not much support
B008X9ZDLG|1|No tracking, waited forever. I understand it was inexpensive but it was not the item that was pictured. The straps were pieced together at different places and the back was not cross laced, just a thin ribbon bow. The shoulder straps also went behind and then forward under the armpits. Very strange and not sexy at all.
B007H65COY|3|I wore it as a t shirt it is to short I thought it would come to my knee. I paid to much for a t shirt. I will not order again but the top did fit I am a size 16.
B00HX0MUKS|5|New favorite shirt
B000QAS2SG|5|Arrived quickly (thanks Amazon) and with zero issue.<br /><br />Even after reading the reviews and the dimensions of this bag, it still surprised me on how big it was, in a good way! Some people complained that there was a very foul odor with this bag, I also did not have this issue. Also, this feel's like a grown up toiletry bag! Not just some $2 plastic one that you picked up at your local supermarket/shopping center.<br /><br />The carrying handle is appropriate for the bag (also leather), not just some cheap piece of frabric added on.<br />Zipper is smooth on both the top and side.<br />Inside it has what appears to be a waterproof material, which is nice.<br />The two compartments are so much bigger and hold so much more than I would have expected. I hold two full size bottles of soap and shampoo, a shaving mug, my aftershave, and deodorant, and still have room left over. On the side pouch I'm able to keep my razor, shaving brush, and comb. Even with all of these things, I could comfortably add more.<br /><br />I love the color, style, and size of this bag. I would recommend this for anyone that travels or needs a toiletry bag. It's classy and for the price, you can't beat it! I was able to get it when it was down to $6 but even at $20 it would be a steal.
B0010KG3KK|1|I tried to order twice from these companies and the order was canceled because it is not in stock and they both still continue to list it on Amazon. I hope they are kicked or Amazon. Never buy from them
B007VEEM34|5|I have been trying to find uniform tights that my daughter won't complain about but will keep her warm when it is cold and I found them!  She wants to wear them every day!  I will be buying these every winter from now on!!  Love, love, love them!
B002K8PC80|5|I love these!  I purchased the Infant 0-2 years and my 6 month old wore them all day and never complained!
B00KQ4E7NQ|4|it is nice ,and I like it
B004A7XXX0|5|just what my daughter needed and wanted comfortable and right price right size came in time would have liked more little flowers or hearts or skulls or something:)
B00JRTNWNW|4|Not awesome quality but great for the price.  Looks as pictured.
B000OENZEK|1|A while back I purchased these and loved them.  They were silky and light, comfortable, washed well, just about perfect.  So I purchased some more, in two colors, black and nude.  The black ones were just like the ones in the first batch; the nude ones were a different material, scratchy, thicker, awful, and they were considerably smaller/tighter than the black ones and the nude ones in the first batch.  So - turns out, (evident from reading the printed-on label) that the first batch, and the black ones in the second batch, were made in the Dominican Republic.  The new  awful nude ones were made in China.  I would love to have more like the original ones.  But I am not going to repurchase.  Very disappointed.  These used to be really nice.  No more.
B008H48CQU|3|the color was a little darker than the carhartt coat I put it on.
B007ZZN564|5|Our 2 1/2 year old is wearing this size because it's a tad bit big for our younger daughter.  We really like the hat so we're okay with the size being a tad bit big.
B0093B2B4K|5|darling,, cant wait to take photos when he grows into it
B007RVSPG6|5|I ordered this wig for a rave party, and it was shipped within two days! I received so many compliments on this wig. It required a bit of fluffing, as expected after being in the package, but it it was not hard to do. Instead of trimming the bangs, I just clipped them to one side with a flower hair pin. It looked adorable!
B00HA3D1A6|4|Work well. Warm, but bulky, not a great fit, but for the price, fantastic!
B00JV41MIU|5|These shirts fit perfectly.
B00THGTTRS|1|WAYYYYYYYY too small!!  I will NOT buy another swimsuit &#34;made in China&#34;!  They are a nation of tiny people that think the size 5XXXXX  is a U.S.  16 with a flat chest...NOT. 😡😡😡. I am keeping the suit because my total focus right now is losing weight (have lost 26# in 3 mos), and I am hopeful that someday it will fit. It is a very cute suit, and unique.
B00B9RGR4Q|4|Like the shorts but shirt meh. If I could rate separately, I would rate the shorts 5 stars and shirt maybe 3 1/2 or 4 stars. The style of shirt is ok ok.
B00O592UNW|4|It fits well and looks nice.  It is a thin cotton that is good for summer.
B00DY9U2CU|4|On sale for under $10.  Heck ya.  it's a rashie for kids.  it works.
B00JYCLF7M|5|Great jeans thanks!
B008X1FTI6|5|Beautiful piece, very economical, variety of designs in this brand, but it takes a long time to arrive. Just recommend
B00EAHHDFE|5|I'm about a 40 F or G and I wear the xl as a nursing bra! I love it. I tell everyone. It fits tightly enough to give me shape and lift but is stretchy enough to pop myself out to nurse from the top or bottom. Winning.
B0077I215A|5|This bra is comfy, cute (I like both sides/colors), and reasonably supportive. I'm able to go jogging with it comfortably. It does fit kind of tight, but that's probably what makes gives it the support that it has. Good buy.
B00CMUR1X0|5|Excellent fit. Know ur jet lag fit. If u don't know.  Might wanna try on. Slim fit. I'm 5'11&#34; 165. 42 chest. 30 in waist. Athletic glutes.
B005KME2Z2|5|This is a great SOA shirt. I actually got 2 for Christmas. I kept both. Just in case one is dirty and I need to wear one.
B006LHN9UY|5|Great for the gym
B001MYYPBI|5|This is a great item. I love the feel of the material and it can go with just about anything!
B00QLJHNOU|4|Exactly what I expected. Great purchase for my costume.
B00STH8MFQ|5|Bought it for a friend for her new born & she said she'll fit in it perfectly
B00KQ7WKXM|4|Bought this for my 3 month old. Fits as a 6-12 month should so it was a little long for my daughter. Bought it big so she can grow into it. Fabric is great and the print is cute. The only thing I don't like about these pajamas are the elastic waist. The elastic band is exposed and is really snug to my daughters waist. It looks a little uncomfortable.
B003BVJ3P8|5|Pretty and sexy! I got proposed to the night after I wore this for my significant other :p he loved it and so do I. The waist is a bit big on me, so if you have an hourglass (I'm 38-26-39 and I went with the Large) it may not fit the best, but it still looks great! Also - a medium would have been better for me, but they were sold out in the color I wanted, so I went with a large. If you have my measurements or smaller, I'd advise something smaller than the large, but again, it still works.
B000A0OVXC|1|too small. and too long
B00IPDFCA2|1|Too small and was broke even before I got to wear it.
B000UMQB1U|5|This is the only custome that i have tried in years that really fits me. I mean is still a little bit big but is perfect. Also the quality is really good. And for only 21 dollars. WOOOOWWW.
B00MUT4DC0|4|Nice dress for the price. My 6 year old daughter loves it and wears it every day after school!
B00HO35J9I|5|Nice swim skirt, is exactly like the picture
B001CJ4HRK|5|looked all over for these red jeans. stores never had the color or size. with amazon we had them in less than a week and free delivery plus cheaper than in the stores. son is happy, have to take them while he sleeps to get them washed. thank youi
B00KFEFGRS|4|A little too small but still fits. Very comfortable, and could feel a difference after a couple days.
B011WY2ULY|5|Kangaroos Plush Thanksgiving day roasted hat is really nice good for parties. and also good for Halloween attire for trick or treats.This product is safe for kids and they make it nicely that the kids will love it.I cant wait to wear this one on thanks giving day.This really fit exactly on my head.This is an adult hat and would be to big for children but great for teenagers .It has a white color on the tip.This hats reminds me of my childhood days.Its  so nice reminiscing things, because of this cute and adorable kangaroo hat, it makes me feel young.I got this as free in exchange to my true and unbiased opinion.
B00URVUDG8|5|Ordered more.
B00CBQ9G9C|1|Shirts was not as described! The post didn't say it was a slim fit and I returned it. Because of this shirt and 4 others I have decided to never shop for clothes in Amazon again. Very disappointed. oh for the person that said their shrunk I have to laugh. The shirt clearly says Dry Clean only. Wash cold water Gentle cycle. God people learn how to wash clothes.
B004R97KP8|1|No recomiendo este producto, lo compre por el respaldo de la marca, no es cuero, es de plastico, la compre en feb y ya esta toda pelada, por este precio hay mejores opciones
B00GAO44FC|5|My husband loves his sweatshirts and is very particular about the quality. He tends to wear them to death. So I knew I had to get something that was going to last. He loves it. If it is great. It's well-made and sturdy. The color is beautiful. He's already living in it.
B004EK1VMI|5|sharp looking cover lots of compliments on the golf course. Nice product great job on the  Eagle Globe and Anchor.
B00QUBDJ60|1|Description of the shirt says that it includes cufflinks. There were no cufflinks. The event is coming up, so I have to go buy cufflinks. Annoyed.
B00ISDZFWE|5|Definitely worth the $5.00 will be reordering. Hugs the body lovely
B0030BEXPE|5|These are great bras I bought several
B00NRQXYDY|1|I couldn't find out how to return it my daughter normally wears a 3x lg . I got the 4x so she can wear a sweater under it and its to small
B00D5S1BIY|4|My daughter is 3 years old but going 4 so she doesn't fit it yet. It runs a little large on my skinny daughter so I know I have to wait till winter of 2014 for her to actually wear it. It has a really cute design and looks nice on her. The colors are not as vibrant as on the internet posting but it's still a pretty color combination.
B00ETHWCQ0|4|This is a great little jacket. I live in Alabama, where it's hardly ever too hot or too cold, so this jacket works perfectly. I like little casual jackets and tops like this for easy care, everyday wear.
B00EL97C2A|5|it was perfect I would order another 1I'm giving it 5 stars A+ !
B00KGV5SSW|5|Good quality
B0056FK6G2|5|this is my second waxwear bag. the last one wore through after many years. they just get better and better with time.
B00D3EDPZ2|2|These pants are very small in the waist.  I fit very comfortably into a 38, and these are extremely tight.  Too tight to keep or wear.  I had to return them for a size 40.  I would advise ordering at least one size bigger than you need.
B00G9QRBDS|5|Fit perfectly.
B00N35UJ32|5|Love these suspenders
B00S97WB8K|4|So pretty! I'm glad I found this here. I've seen it advertised through other places at higher prices. This is the same cover up dress. The tie is a bit strange to overcome at first, but I don't foresee it being a major issue. I can't wait to wear it to the beach :-)  I'm 5'2, 125 lbs with a 34&#34; bust, and it fits perfect. The length is to my ankles when wearing it as a dress. Taller girls may want to beware of that if they want length. But I really like it.
B00HEBX8X4|1|I purchased this dress in a size XL because I am a size 12 in dresses. It was way too small. My boobs were smushed and everything. Very disappointed. On the plus side, it came very fast.
B00LKPGZPI|5|I really like this skull cap and its big enough for my head. Good quality
B0012MKWWQ|1|so so
B004K3YRLG|5|This was very cute but ran small.  I am a size 2 and about 5'2&#34; tall.  I purchased the small/medium and I had to wear leggings with this because it wouldn't have covered my bottom otherwise.  It did fit me great and was flattering since it was fitted on my waistline but if you intend to wear this as pictured with no bottoms than you will need to order a size larger.
B0058LTVGU|3|they one of the snaps popped off right away, as soon as i opened it. i hid it pretty well and still wore it out.
B00I0QB528|5|Nice product, I would tell my friends to buy this.
B00B61KGNS|4|The quality of the material was very good, and I like the way it fits.
B002662D5Q|3|Does not take much stretching to cause material to separate apart.
B0045H0L1W|2|I ordered 200 Finger Lights and 34 of them did not work.  They are poor quality and I wouldn't buy these again.
B008AGSI5A|4|Just so you know, I'm female; I use my husband's account. I wanted to leave a comment to let everyone know about sizing. This corset fits me well but it is a bit big, even when tied as tight as it will go. I ordered the XL because I kept reading that you should buy one to two sizes bigger than your shirt size. Well, I should have bought a L because I wear a small shirt. I am 5'2, 143 lbs, size 8 jeans. Hope this helps anyone else!
B001IIICSK|5|Was just like the TV show. Well done love my patch.
B0095BJIFI|3|I bought xxl which fits always. This time is more like L or XL. Bad that all paperwork is already gone.
B003ILWDQC|5|very comfortable
B002ZG7K96|5|I was immediately pleased with this cardigan as soon as I took it out of the package. The color is great and the fabric was heavier than what I'd imagined. Overall a great buy!
B00NL3MFAG|5|You'll be able to play freely in the sun.
B000YEJGEI|5|Red is my favorite color and I have been trying to find a skort that doesn't look like shorts from behind and can be dressed up or down, and this was exactly what I was looking for.  I can wear it with a tank top and flip flops or a nice shirt and heels, either way it looks great.  My younger sister keeps asking me what other colors the skort comes in, cause she wants one of her own now too.
B003TJKK9A|5|Bought this for my wife.  We recently got married and I emailed the seller asking if the item could possibly get here any sooner than advertised and they very respectfully told me, &#34;probably not coming from China&#34;.  I explained that I was getting married in a few weeks and wanted it by my wedding date but I understood.  The representative congratulated me and threw in two extra pieces which was a very nice thing to do.  The items actually got to me before my wedding date but since our wedding was a destination wedding and we had already left we didn't get it until we got back.  Now about the item.  It was exactly as advertised and for the price actually pretty sturdy.  My wife rocks it!!!  Great product and a very helpful customer service dept.
B00823Y4KE|5|This is the perfect turtleneck! It's super close fitting which makes it warm and great to go under close fitting jackets etc. for a smooth fit. I'm 5'2 and petite, but I have a large chest and it fits great! Once you stretch out the neck it's fine :)
B00KOOX5CW|5|holds books
B003Q3AA4Y|2|For me this belt was just ok. It was very long somewhat flimsy and more of a neon pik color which was not my cup of tea.
B00N50DXG0|2|HUGE shrinkage after 1st wash/dry.... They're now too small for my son after wearing once. I bought size 8 knowing it would be too big, as I knew it would shrink a little. But I am talking up to mid arm and mid calves!
B00PHBYQ8Y|5|Love, love, love this bra.
B00EZI1IO0|1|I can't recommend
