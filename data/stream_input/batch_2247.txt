B003U4UPTE|5.0|If you don't think LOST is one of the best series ever you either were t smart enough to follow along or don't like this type of show.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|This headset works great, crystal clear voice chat, good bass surround sound effect, best for fps games. The only downside is that this headset doesn't last.  I had it for seven months and took really good care of it, the worst I did to it was accidentally dropped it three feet to the ground. This headset just falls apart on its own. After four to five months of gaming sessions the right earcup broke off with the wires still intact. I was like ok, a little super glue should fix it and it did with the costs of not turning anymore. Two weeks later the left earcup broke off. Now both side of the headset are superglued and can't be turned to rest on my neck anymore. Something like this I can managed with. A month later the left side of the headset suddenly died and the mic works fifty percent of the time. Thus it was time to put the headset to rest, we'd had a great run but it was kind of short.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Pro: -works great (chat/sound effects)<br />  -not too difficult to setup<br />  -wires are easy to organize<br /><br />Con: -does not last, falls apart from being used.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was an excellent documentary of Dr Alexander's account of his life altering near-death experience.  I would highly recommend reading of his book.  Dr. Alexander's account provides a more indepth, excellently detailed experience of heaven.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could have waited 2 more hours at the airport and not have noticed because this book was so well written!!!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This is a good movie!  Can't believe I missed it at the movies.  Matt D. always puts out a good performance.  It is a perfect example of how the rich think they can get away with anything.  And how the psychotic mind works.  They only way to beat crazy is with crazy.

B0093BUWGE|5.0|Jose is what has been needed in music. He combines jazz with hip hop and does it very well. He is also like an old soul singing Billie Holiday's music.  Has a wide range.  Love his music and his live performances are well worth your attention.,
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Fits my had perfectly, and allows a good amount of customization. Great mouse at a great price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a faster mouse.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show ever so far!  There was never a dull moment, suspense throughout each episode.  I had to come home everyday after work and watch at least five hours of the show.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I just love having the Google app on my Kinde.  It is very fast and I can now search for anything just like on my laptop.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is an amazing CD. I love the songs. They messed up on beca's rap and since you been gone. But I love it anyway!!!😄😄😄
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I just Linkedin.  I am very happy that there is an app for my Kindle Fire.  I use it a lot.  It is a great application that allows you to stay current on your industry, network, look for jobs, communicate you past and current co-workers and so much more.

0756655730|5.0|Thanks to DK, they made a beautiful book. Really thick and high quality publication. Lots and lots of photos inside. A nice piece for your collection.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|There was a flipping glitch and it wouldn't fix so i deleted it and downloaded it again and last time i had to re download it it stayed thw same still x30 but when i did it a second time i had to start all the way from the beginning. DONT GET THIS GAME. Its boring anywayz
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I was really impressed with how creepy this movie started out.  It felt realistic and just left you feeling gross for the atrocities apparently commited.  Unfortunately, the story started to get out of control in a very dumb way.  It spiraled into a typical crappy movie and left me feeling ripped off of a potentially great horror movie.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. A little struggle at the beginning for<br />Me. But got sucked into the depth of craziness that Pi endured and I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />I loved the part where the Priest, Imam, and Pandit came face to face with Pi and his mom and dad. Brilliant
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire 1st edition.  The calibration is easy to follow and very helpful.  My battery lasts longer.
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|You know it's going to be a great CD when you listen to it a couple times and can't express your feelings about it adequately. The music on this CD is deliciously complex, dark, powerful, and soothing. For me, it is the best music of 2013 (so far).
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I was drawn into the story and loved learning about the different abilities of the children. I don't really think of it as a children's book. It's a little depressing and a bit scary at times but I enjoyed the story and was sorry when it ended.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|This was a soothing, charming read with delightful little insights to human behavior and character all the way through.  Just the thing to curl up with a cup of hot tea.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|This guy can belt out some notes.  Sounds like a modern Michael Jackson, who we all know his stuff.  Catch beats and original.  Hope he stays healthy and working.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|My Microsoft gaming mouse went out on me after several years of using it, so I began searching for a gaming mouse to use.  I mostly play League of Legends and Left for Dead on my PC so I didn't need anything super special.  I started researching my options to find out that most &#34;good&#34; gaming mice are like 100 bucks.  I'm not paying 100 bucks for a mouse.<br /><br />I found the Anker mouse on Amazon and read its fantastic reviews and figured that I'd give it a try.  It is absolutely stunning. Has great build quality and features not normally found in a mouse this inexpensive. The mouse has tons of customization options and the software (which one user said was cumbersome) to be apt in what you need it to do. Figured out how to change settings and add profiles in less than 2 minutes.  It may not be the simplest software that I've ever used, but it very much gets the job done.<br /><br />As for gaming, the on the fly DPS changing button is nice. I use a different DPI setting for League of Legends than I do Left for Dead.  Makes it super easy to switch profiles as well, for different games and web browsing.  I do see only positions for two different profiles though, I think I would like to have a few more spots for them.<br /><br />Other than that mild complaint, for the price I paid this is a stellar gaming mouse.  Used it a bit last night and the response is AMAZING!  Weights that are included are nice, the mouse was a little light for my taste so I plugged in the weights and i was good to go!
B002N1AEN2|3.0|Not bad.  Thought there would be more variety to the songs.  Love the intro and good stuff for making love too!  Only complaint is the songs all seem to sound the same as if it is all one song.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I have recently started watching this show and I love it. I would and have recommended it to all my friends.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Have watched it several times! I recommend buying this and all Twilight movies! The chemistry between Edward and Bella is Great!
B00APACSJG|5.0|Another great addition to the world of our favorite hyper-active half-pint. I was very happy with the way the story fit in to the changing world.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is awesome I have been searching for a game like this that is scary and a puzzle that is not exactly easy
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great Book!The ending was a little weak. I hope the price of the sequel drops soon so I can continue with the saga
B005COO1X6|3.0|Not bad. Typical King short story, however for the price the product is overpriced. The ending was abrupt and way to soon.
0307949486|5.0|This was one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.I am sorry there will be no more in the series.
B008Y73940|5.0|Plot was complex but easy to follow. Each scene was logically connected to main theme. Complex structure makes movies enjoyable as long as plot twists support or expand main theme in a logical and sequential manner.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Action packed right at the start and all the way through the movie. Normally a sequel is not as good as the first movie that came out but this one will not disappoint.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Well written, intriguing, fun.  If you are from the Bay Area, love books, apppreciate technology, or know anything about Google, you will likely enjoy this book.
B00942V1J4|5.0|I am now a Twilight Fan! I love the books and movies! I highly recommend them to anyone! These are so enjoyable and the more I watch the movies the more I enjoy them.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Purchased this for my daughter and it's a hit!  She carries it with her and pops it into the CD player whenever we are in the car.  Upbeat, fun songs.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have not read this book, but I have read at least 25 (negative) reviews and judging by the information I have gathered, this bookmade Breaking Dawn look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />This book is so redundant. According to another reviewer, the charachters did some things,like, 150 times!<br /><br />For example, Anastasia Steele might be a hybrid of a toilet and a human. I mean, she's flushing ALL THE TIME and always says some variation of &#34;crap&#34; If this is true, all the normal toilets out there must be proud of their high IQ levels compaired to Ana Porcelain-er, Steele.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a BILLIONAIRE who can do anything. He can hold a rake as he balances a cake with a toy boat on top as he puts on a funny red striped hat and balances a fish on it. He does all this while standing on a ball. But that is not all, no that is not all. He plays the piano, emails his so-called girlfriend, and buys gifts for her. Hey! Don't interrupt! I'm still not done yet. Christian loves to keep a close eye on his girl, and this generally means stalking her.<br /><br />It was a bad idea to write about Wasington if the author lives in the UK. I actually do live in Washington, and no matter what Stephanie tells you, EL, it's not always rainy and gloomy here.<br /><br />So yeah. This was Fifty Shades of Grey. What it should've been called was Fifty Ways to Waste Paper.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Love Bon Jovi's sound and the enthusiasm that comes through their music.  Always makes me happier listening to them.  Get's me moving!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I never get tired of this show.  Since the very first episode it has been full of exciting twists and turns.  Absolutely LOVE it!
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing! Loved listening to them on their youtube channel and just had to buy this CD. Can't wait to play these instrumental pieces at my wedding!

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Awesome and great way to get up in the morning after that sleepy night.I love my all-time alarm system!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!l love it.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|Having read some of the reviews here, this one might be a touch redundant.  I do not provide plot summaries and opinions about acting etc in any of my reviews but just write about the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray.  I had bought The Terminator on Blu Ray a day before the remastered version's release was announced and immediately returned the Blu Ray to the store and waited till the remastered version came out.<br /><br />The video transfer is certainly a big improvement over the original Standard Def release.  The video on this remastered version retains some of the original film grain from the film but nothing that is terribly noticeable unless you pause on an image.  There are no crawling ants in the grain or any artifacting to distract you.  The original film, which I saw in the theater when it was first released became a classic and deservedly so.  That said, some of the effects are very obvious, for example, when Arnold is looking in the mirror and working on his eye it is easy to tell that that is more animation than a real Arnold that we are looking at.  Technology has greatly improved since then so we just have to take obvious effects as the groundbreaking events they were at the time of their making.  Never the less,  the film looks great and, Yes, the color grading is considerably cooler than in previous releases.  Whether or not this is a good thing or not is not for me to judge.  After having seen the film so many times over the years, it was very noticeable to me but that doesn't make it better or worse.  That opinion is up to the individual viewer.<br /><br />The Audio is DTS MA 5.1 and it, as well as the subtitles, are supplied in several different languages.  The lossless and remixed audio, to me, is the star of this version as the editors went to town making sure that proper audio steering to a surround system was realistically done.  There is excellent use of both the front and rear sound stages with discreet channeling throughout the movie of various foley fx.  Your LFE sub channel will also get a decent workout as the bottom end is pretty deep at times.  The audio levels are properly set so that there is no need to roller coaster your remotes volume levels between action and dialogue shots.  Yes, there is no original mono mix for anyone who prefers that, but I do prefer this lossy surround mix myself. For me, this mix makes the audio DEMO worthy to show off your home theater's surround processor.<br /><br />The extras consisted of several 'Terminated Scenes' that may or may not have contributed to an extended version but there was nothing there that jumped out at me saying \\"put me back in\\".  There was also a pretty old Retrospective of the Terminator consisting of a discussion between Arnold and James Cameron.  I really didn't think too much of it but there were some interesting points made by both.  I did not know that Arnold was originally to be the hero of the film as Michael Beine eventually became.<br /><br />Personally, since I never saw the original blu ray release I cannot say whether, if you already have it on blu ray you should upgrade to the remastered version.  However, if you only have it on Standard Def, then I do think this is a very worthy upgrade.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase.<br />Thanksvarious foley fx.

B001DJLD1M|1.0|i got the collection and to my surprise the first disc has scratches that are deep in the DVD itself so it cant be fixed and of course i cant email the vendor because its from amazon it self if they could be resolved id rate it higher all the other discs appear to not have any scratches just the first one like i said if it gets resolved i shall rate it higher
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We started to watch Downton Abbey on the recommendation of our son. We were immediately entranced and could not stop in our marathon until we had watched the entire first season in one long, thrilling encounter. We literally had to order the 2nd and 3rd season on rush delivery to continue our experience. Why is is so &#34;addicting?&#34; The character development is second to none, and the twists and turns of the stories are fascinating. You will not be able to stop, either. I am now hoping the fourth season will be available posthaste. I am in awe of the author's ability to create these characters, and of the various actors and actresses skills in bringing them to life. Within each episode, there are perhaps five to six story lines being played out simultaneously, and the episode switches seamlessly from one situation to the next. We truly care about these people, and their dilemmas. We laugh, cry, and experience the whole range of emotion while watching. Make sure you have an entire weekend free, because you will not want to stop!
B00AY0A71I|5.0|Make sure you have plenty of tissue and a spare change of underwear, because you will cry yourself laughing and wet your pants several times with hilarity!

B00B23O96A|5.0|To those who don't like this CD, get over it. It is like criticizing Louis Armstrong because he is not playing the same way he did in the Hot 5 or Hot 6 bands. Both artists have matured and moved beyond playing like they did when they were at age 25. Clapton, like Armstrong, has broadened his horizons beyond displaying his technical skills on guitar and has earned the right to record music he enjoys on his own terms. I still remember, back in the early '70s, people putting down his version of \\"I shot the sheriff\\" because there was no Les Paul riffing on it. In fact, the Yardbirds, Bluesbreakers, Cream, Blind Faith, D&D and the solo stuff all had their own distinct flavors. he is mature now and no longer plays 100 notes when one sung/played word will do. So, to all you naysayers, please give it a break. EC owes us nothing. As a player, I find I always learn something from his music. He is getting older (only a few years older than I) and, yes, someday he will be gone. I have humbly learned to not judge the man too harshly because, he is a man following his own muse (and often the rest of us come around eventually and understand what he is doing). Kudos to Mr. Clapton for continuing to grow. Look, the guy is talented and whatever he sings/plays is done with heart. Heck, he could play \\"All of me\\" and make it sound soulful (ooopps...in fact he does do that...on this very CD). Buy it now and avoid sheeplessly getting it later after you finally catch on to what he is up to.
0307951529|5.0|First off let me say that Chris is a great guy having just meet him at a book signing and speaking engagement in Newark, New Jersey on March 14, 2013.  What Chris says in this book is all true and after reading you can't help but want to say \\"SCREW YOU, BOSS\\", I'm going to do something that matters to me and that I'm in control of my own life and destiny.  For me on December 1st, 2012 I was fired from Ramsey Infiniti  for being a \\"LOUD TALKER\\", but this was the best thing that ever happened to me, since it gave me the motivation and freedom to pursue my own dream......which I'd have for the past 5 years to start my own online business [...] \\"high-end toys for high-end boys\\" which will go life by the middle of April 2013.  For anyone contemplating starting their own business,,,,I say just do it....don't think about it....don't you want to have control of your own life???

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is amazing its awesome you can play with friends and family+ if you are bored you can always do this :)
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! In reality, it's a bit of a strange storyline. However, it incorporates that strangeness with love, drama, action, and destiny turning out to be a great book. :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a good game but it is taking me some time to get it right---bought it because it reminded me of mario and it has been a very long time since I played that game--I will keep trying
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I have to call amazon android kindle help line each time I buy a book. It won't download purchased books.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Wow I love this game and kids of all ages should play it!<br />It is a great experience for kids to play and should be rated a four<br />Star or more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|And the quality on Amazon ain't too bad, either. Would definitely recommend a friend to watch it on Amazon vs. other options out there.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Read this book a number of years ago, but got so much more from reading it this time.  Sometimes when life, the living and the loving of it, hurts,  one might want to be able to stop the feelings and the memories.  It is  an intriguing idea ---- to be able to get rid of that which causes one sadness or pain, but .....<br />One cannot really understand excitement and joy or exhilaration, without having also experienced monotony, sadness, boredom.  Can't imagine life without memories, or love.  May we never let our government, by the people and for the people, be duped into establishing such laws.  Sometimes we seem precariously close, as the ideas of euthanasia,  abortion (for an inconvenient pregnancy, or for sex selection), and legalizing certain drug usage, to just name a few, flood our society today. Be careful, freedom of choice, is a precious gift.  God gave mankind \\"free will\\" so that we are not little Pinocchio puppets.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book will definitely see movie when when comes out! The first book was the very best though but this was still good
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Immediately I thought the best possible double feature for this genre would be SkyCaptain and the world of Tomorrow along with Captain America.<br /><br />Against all odds, the good guys always win.<br /><br />Lotsa fun and fantasy.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is Larsson at his very best - tying up the loose ends and addressing all the unanswered questions. This is a brilliant study in dysfunctionality!!!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|My husband and I were given Seasons One and Two as a gift.  We couldn't wait to view Season Three.  What a series!  The end of each episode just leaves you wanting to see the next episode immediately.

B008HJGPVO|5.0|I bought this stylus mainly for drawing on my tablet but use it for all tablet functions, writing, browsing etc and it works great in the few weeks I've had it. Like all AmazonBasics products I've purchased this pen is of top quality and works flawlessly. The smallest tip(5mm) is very good for drawing, very easy to see around, not blocking the line you are drawing like a larger tip and the smallest tip I could find on a stylus pen. Not a fault of the pen but I would love to see a replaceable tip on this pen is made so good.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Movie works great! Box is a bit of a mess! I guess thats just being picky.... Love the movie! Great Price.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is by far one of the best match three games I've played. The graphics are bright and the music is extremely relaxing. If you're a fan of this kind of game then you'll love it.

B002RI90WM|4.0|Very enjoyable book written from an interesting perspective.  Probably not the right book to read if you have a much loved dog suffering from hip disease (as mine is).  Found myself crying numerous times through the book and struggled with the penultimate chapter.  A very thoughtful view of love and loss and fighting for what is yours.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|this is a great family movie for kids of all ages. it is not just for winter time either... fantastic
B005HF19EY|3.0|Very interesting premise and the show can be quite good when Allison is working a case. But there's entirely too much home life which puts a real drag on the action. If I want to watch whiny kids, a boring husband and an often petulant wife/mother in their tedious daily routine, I can go over to my neighbor's. It's certainly not why I stream videos. You might think that a household with two members who can see dead people would be interesting. But then, you might be wrong.<br /><br />I watched because I'm an Amazon Prime member. I'd advise potential buyers to give it a good sampling first.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I don't watch a lot of television, mainly because there aren't very many on the air that are worth watching. I didn't see Firefly when it was on the air. I was given the DVD by a friend who knows I love good sci-fi shows. This show either made me laugh out loud, yell and scream at the tv or cry my heart out. Not once or twice, every episode. The writing is in your gut real, the actors fit together in a way that steals your heart from the first episode on. It's love at first site ladies and gentlemen. It's a drama, a love story, action adventure, realistically dark and explosively funny. The only problem is it was only fourteen episodes long. I want more!!! Way to go FOX. Don't forget to get the movie Serenity. Joss Whedon's Firefly is also on Facebook, like it.
B00BHMF578|3.0|I liked watching this movie just because I learnt about rescue of six Americans in a dramatic fashion from Iran.  It is an captivating story in itself.  But I did not think delivery of the story is to the hype which surrounds this movie .  It could have been much more dramatic.  For example, the scene when Tony decided that it is his responsibility to take six on his own, left me wishing for more.  I believe there were several such missed opportunities in the movie.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I think Taylor Swift is the best female artist goin. She is very attractive and has the best music goin.
B001UEBHYS|4.0|I saw this movie AFTER seeing Dev Patel in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (and a season on the Newsroom/HBO). The violence was a bit over the top for me - but certainly seemed appropriate once the story unfolded. Good strong story - good characters - good ending.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Very good album that I heard from a buddy of mine, that I like very much and will pass it on.
B0053DYNOS|5.0|This non-fiction account of Orwell's experiences in the Spanish Civil War is a prelude to the ideas he developed later in his classic novels.  His description of the infighting of the left and the eventual betrayal of the cause by the Stalinist Russians is telling.  Also, his days and nights at the front in trench warfare reminds us that 1938 was not that far from 1914, in terms of military tactics, but light years from todays drones and &#34;smart&#34; bombs.  Highly recomended, not only for history buffs or folks interested in Catalunya, but anyone interested in the thinking going into his fictional work.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|Was very disappointed with the acting and the film did not hold my attention. I would not want to view it a second time.
1616550414|5.0|As a fan of the game series I like this book very much!! Good art!! Great designs!! It's an amazing purchase! Thank you!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who loves a show that grabs their attention from the beginning and keeps them on the edge of their seat through to the end. Every season, every show did this for me. Never a disappointment.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Saw this in a local independent theatre and loved it.  A disabled friend said he wanted it so I pre-ordered earlier this year for him.  It has something for everyone.
0446580848|3.0|I have been been a Nelson DeMille fan ever since I read The Charm School. I eagerly looked forward to new books by DeMille as I enjoyed his character and quick paced plots. Hopefully DeMille has not lost those skills. In the Panther, I found the book to be plodding and John Corey to be an annoying character. While I enjoyed his character in previous books, his constant sarcastic asides detracted greatly from the enjoyment of reading this book. The Panther could have used a more aggressive editor who would have cut down on the asides, accelerated the plot and left us with a 400 page fast moving novel instead of a 600 page plodder.
0486237664|5.0|Finally something that offers a sense of texture and contour for the kids to latch onto for their art lessons.  A must have for an art teacher or anyone learning to draw!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love this movie! So wonderful! Wish I would've waited until I got my blu-ray player though! Need four more words for this stupid word minimum on reviews...
B0053KWDES|5.0|This is my first FiiO product.<br />I had been looking for one product that goes well with my Sansa Clip.<br />But after listening top this, my attitude towards (affordable) portable head amps changed.<br />Amazing doesn't even come close!<br /><br />Anything less than 5 stars hadn't made sense.
B00628RFPM|5.0|I showed this film to my 9th grade World History class. Brought tears to many girls' eyes, but a wonderful story.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|Simply a great film. Honestly, the less you read about it before seeing it, the better. Just see this movie! The blu-ray release is excellent but it's also worth seeing in a theatre.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns. Great book! This book comes highly recommended by me just loved it. The series was great all together.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a novel approach to not only to have the book narrated by Enzo the dog, but do in in such a creative and insighful way.  Whoever thought a dog would be so philosophical?  &#34;That which you manifest is before you.&#34;  As soon as he explains that in terms of racing in the rain, but to allogorically apply that to life as Denny faces it as well as all of us.  Garth has also obviously done his homework in the garage as well.  His accurate BMW and Porsche facts add credibility, even if he is a terrier mix...
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love the way this book was written, switched back and forth from the husband and wife's point of views.  A little disappointed in the ending, but over all good read.
0060926422|5.0|Helpful guidelines to relationship building, not non-fiction piece. Glad to add to my collection of self help books. Will read for years to come. Thank you Delia
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is an amazing series and this season did not disappoint, just kept you wanting more.  Can't wait for season 4!
B0081336FO|5.0|Sherlock, BBC, Moffatt... these three alone should be telling of what a great show this is. Don't miss out on this wonderful show.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I think it is difficult to find a watch that does not look fancy but still has nice movement, weight, and time.  I like that with this watch I can feel a great watch on my wrist but it isn't flashy.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|love it you have to get it so fun lol. if you like animal's. get the game sooooooo fun .
B007REV4YI|5.0|If I write about the movie I'll spoil it...let me put it like this...Bond is getting old, the entire department is getting old and some believe it's time to retire but Legends don't die, they just loose weight.  You'll see some epic story telling that leads back to the days of Sean Connery including some nice surprises in unexpected places.  A few laughs, a lot of action and, of course, Bond girls and you have a fantastic movie on par with any other Bond.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|OMG this is awesome! especislly for party's,I was making a party plan and I'm not good at math so ZI got this. IT DOWNLOADED SSSSSOOOOO FAST!!
B005LAII1C|5.0|The Creator of Family Guy has done it again...is there anything this guy can't do?  Seriously?  Ted is a story of a boy with a bear, he makes a wish and the bear comes to life.  Pretty cool, well Seth Macfarlane decided to turn that on it's head and ask:  Well, what happens if the bear grows up?  &#34;Ted&#34; is what happens.  The surprising guest stars, the fantastic narration of Patrick Stewart... seriously I think Seth is just trying to come up with lines for Patrick to say just because he wants to see if he'll do it, I mean it's such an amazing voice saying such unexpected and vulgar things...oh, sorry no spoilers.  I haven't laughed so hard at a movie since &#34;Dumb and Dumber.&#34;  What a joyride.  Warning!  The movie contains nudity, mostly of a bear, use of drugs and alcohol, kidnapping, hookers, and yes, lots and lost of off color humor.  But it's ok because it's done with Bostonian accents that you can find yourself in and not able to get out of later.  I think if you have the capability to hold on and not judge before the end of the flick, you'll be surprised by how cool it really is.  Thanks for reading and have a nice day!
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I thought the movie was very funny and very kid friendly.  I LOVED THE GRANDMA!!!!!!!!! She was so cool..<br />  I would totally reccomend this movie for sleepovers (for all you little kids out there who have an awesome imagination.)
B009K45Y62|5.0|Ok for starts the product itself with the mask, etc...oh my lord, how beautifully constructed!  number of authenticity and the whole nine yards...oh it's so nice to see in person it really is!  Love it!  Ok now moving on to the film.  It's a long film, but it's a short film, once it gets going, (which doesn't take long) it never really slows down, next thing you know 2 and 1/2 hours has passed felt like you've been watching for an hour, tops.  Also the social commentary of the piece, magnificent, the artwork of the locations and the environments, amazing.  I went and saw this on opening night, no I'm not from Colorado and yes I feel for those folks, but we can't let one loon ruin such a great film!  It has romance, action, comedy, pain, drama, and of course...BATMAN!  What a piece, what a piece, if Man of Steel goes as well this might be the star of the DC look to push into films that can eventually cross over, like the Avenger's did.  Only if Man of Steel works, and it can't just work so-so it has to work like this movie works, it has to be awesome, otherwise DC should stick with animation and leave the movies to the B and C class heroes and groups like the Losers and R.E.D. and leave Marvel to the big names.  Ok I've had my rant as well as my say about how good this movie is!<br /><br />What do you mean you haven't put it in your cart yet?  Of course you should!  You may not need the Limited Edition but you should at least pick up the Blu-ray or the DVD!  Yes, yes you should!...don't argue, trust me!  You'll like yourself in the morning.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Thrift shop may be one of the most played but it's by no means the best song. The album has a ton of great songs

B000NTPDSW|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the perfect FILM as Art......It is beautiful to watch and the performances are perfect...the era is recreated with perfection from dress to autos....Of course, Marlon was perfect too.  Having this set in one package will be a viewing treat for many years to come for my family.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you are as fascinated by the time gone by as I am...then the third year of Downton Abbey exceeds expectations...I received DVDS of the first two seasons as a gift..and could not wait for the third to air  (although I watched most of the episodes live anyway)!!<br /><br />If you are old enough to remember the series 'Upstairs/Downstairs'..I believe you will not be disappointed by this intriguing account of life in England as &#34;society&#34; goes through its inevitable evolution...
0375703861|2.0|In principle, Smith is a good writer and the book is a masterpiece.  However, it is so boring that I had to fight the temptation to throw it away before finishing it every time I though to continue.<br /><br />Like one reviewer notices, just as you get interested in one person and their actions, the author is off to another person or topic.  In some books it works because the writer is able to engage you.  Smith does not.  You have to constantly fight to engage yourself and not fall asleep.<br /><br />Good luck plodding through it.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Really cute and fun! I can not stop playing. Playing on Samsung Galaxy S III and the game is running really smooth.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|First thing, No Commercials, that is enough to keep you watching. However I think it's a pretty good story. It's slow to get started but moves along after about the 2nd episode.
1593157134|5.0|this is a great book to read with it comes to network marketing because it realy helps you as the network marketer/business owner get into it.
B002SF9YUM|4.0|Very interesting.  RPatz is really good - he's not Edward at all.  He is the surreal artist Dali!<br />Liked it a lot.
0060555661|5.0|weather your degree is in finance/acounting whaterver, you can still find that this book is amazing.  it really opens your mind to a good/bad investment and why you're investing.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I believed it was going to be the best Bond yet - but it wasn't in my humble opinion. Too much M - OMG.  It's all about M.  I was expecting something like, Casino Royale with Daniel Craig - in my opinion, THAT's the best Bond yet.  I was disappointed.  But I love Daniel Craig, and I think that he is the best Bond ever.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone me and my son loved it! It's funny heart felt with some action, it's worth it?
0062082353|5.0|I like that this book about Chris Kyle is told by him and not some journalist. When you are reading the book it feels like you are sitting there with Chris while he tells you the story. Its full of gritty details and behind enemy line accounts. Great book for any adult not just one interested in military literature.
030758836X|4.0|I have to admit..I passed over this book many times.  Then, after I saw how many people had read it and reviewed it, I thought I would give it a try.  Very clever story in which you experience many different emotions.  However, toward the end, it bordered on getting irritating.  It's like two people who love to hate each other and hate to love each other.  With that said, it was hard to stop reading it.  All in all, I figure if a book can make you want to keep reading then it must be a good book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I happened to just watch this one day based on the picture.  So glad I did!!  Can't believe I haven't heard of it soon seeing how popular it is.  I'm not one to watch shows twice...this one I have!!
B008EZVNFE|4.0|I like her style it's just a few songs I need to re-hear to see if I totally love the CD. In my opinion she is in the genre with India Arie so if you like her and others in this category you will enjoy this CD.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I can definitely see myself playing this for hours after I sampled it. Takes a bit if skill and a bit of patience.  Nice relaxing soundtrack to go with it too.
0761158820|3.0|some are easy but most are difficult to assemble. Think twice if buying this for younger children otherwise the adult will do most.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Just when I thought this great actor showed us all he had (which is pretty darn good) he pulls this out of his pocket and does a great job doing something he's never done before! I won't say anything but if you havent seen this movie go get it now!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|simple to use lets you modify settings, start plans, and bookmarks whatever you like. It also works without the internet if you download the available translations also if you rather listen then read it has that option too
B005LAII8K|4.0|And thank you Joseph Gordon Levitt! This movie was very well done! It's kinda weird to see Levitt made up to look like Bruce Willis but it goes away after a while. Good movie!!
B0050PYNP8|4.0|I really liked the movie. Somon Pegg and Nick Frost are really good in this movie and Jason Bateman was surprisingly funny. All the people who say that this movie \\"bashes christians\\" need to get a life. IT IS A COMEDY! People will see anti-christian stuff everywhere. Remember the kooks that bashed the Harry Potter series? This is a funny movie and if you liked Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead you will also like this one.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Sorry Sean Connery, Daniel Craig is a great Bond! I loved this movie and the other two Daniel Craig 007 movies. Ok, I liked Quantom of Solice. Shout out to M, Ms. Moneypenny and Q.Very good choices. And like the Dark Knight movies, rebooting the 007 series with very good writing work like a charm.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Great read for anyone suffering from an eating disorder, self-esteem issues or body image troubles. A real eye opener and inspirational story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fast paced, but being old, I lack the skills and stamina of my children.  However I cannot stop playing once I get started.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|What a songwriting talent with the voice to go with it! And she plays the piano to go along with it all.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|Definitely an awesome app to have for Christmas. Its great for kids and adults. There are several levels of difficulty so it never gets boring.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Marcus's account of his time in the service is very interesting regarding his BUDS training. What the most compelling part of this book, is the mission that Marcus and his team went thru...cudos on BUDS training.<br />please read :-)
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This works great and the price was right!! I wish i could run it on my desktop windows PC I very happy with this android App.

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|This movie had me rolling the whole time I was watching it. I have to say my girlfriend didn't like the part about Boston girls either but I had some humor out of it
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|I had high hopes for this one as I had read the book. It is a great story and the movie simply did not do it justice. It kind of breezed through everything without getting too deep.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This three book series was superb!  One after the next kept me wanting to read more and more.  I couldn't wait to get to the next book. If you have an opportunity to read this with an open mind and have s little freak in you its a must read!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found this book on a recommendation and once I started it, I couldn't stop reading. It is an amazing story of lost youth and the harshness of life, but you really root for the main character and want him to make it through. I had to read the rest of the series as well to see how his whole story unfolded.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This book was great. I can't even think of words to describe it. It was just.... great no more than that is was amazing and unforgettable. It keeps you wanting more. Wishing this was a series and not a trilogy. All I can say is read it... you won't regret it.
B00782O7NE|5.0|The other reviews have said it all. \\"The Artist\\" is a throwback to the finely-crafted films of the 20s and 30s, and succeeds through brilliant acting performances, superb cinematography and production design; along with a profound respect for the art of film...not special digital effects, not high-definition video, not smart-aleck, inside-joke scripting; but film...with all its character and personality and humanity. A modern classic, \\"The Artist\\" belongs in any collection, as it represents authentically virtuoso filmmaking.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app because it is addicting and I can never stop playing it! It good  for all ages and free and easy! This is a game everyone should enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Once you play for awhile every day you accumulate so many coins y you can't get rid of them they just keep getting higher and higher. I am over 2100 coins and still climbing
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is awesome!it's great for when you just wanna text and send pics. some phones don't get pic texting and this is the best free way you can.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Most people have seen Terminator Two at least once. There is little need to critique it other than it's a great movie. I decided to see it in blu-ray so purchased this edition. When I put it into my new Sony player with WiFi, it said that it did not have enough memory to play this Blu-ray. Memory? I tried it several times and nothing. I asked a few people if they had experienced this and got no help. Finally, I changed a setting on the player to DVD rather than BD which really makes no sense since the directions said it would play this type of disk,BD.And after a couple of tries it played. I'm not convinced that the player setting was wrong and I don't think there is anything wrong with the Blu-ray disk. If anyone knows anything about this problem, please let me know.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game. It helps you relax and concentrate more on what you are doing. The creator of this game...if you are out there....great job at this game. I never thought this game would be fun but itz amazing and fantasized. From ya girl AITIANA SULTON ;)
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I am new to both the Harry Potter movies and to Blu-ray. I never watched the potter movies when they first came out. because of a hearing problem, which is taken care of now. My wife and I watched the full series in DVD for the first time a few weeks ago and loved them. They are really wonderful films. I decided to try the Blu-ray edition on my new player. They are really beautiful. The clarity and detail in these Blu-rays are amazing. I haven't watched them all yet, but I'm confident they will all have this great quality. I highly recommend this set.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Whoa!  This one of those movies that can either turns you off or grabs you so very hard that it really makes one think about love, tru-love.  Maybe, the old saying is right--love, tru-love knows no boundries or scenerio.  This film portrays the love that developes between two half-brothers and follows with the different trials and trivelations at the beginning of their adult lives.  The two actors that portray these two main characters, give the sudience an unbelievable performance!  Take the one you love and cherish to see the film, it can doubly reinforce the love between yourselves!  LOVE IS A CONDITION FAR BEYOND MAN'S ARTICULATION!  NJMJr<br />PS Everytime I view this film, there is plenty of tears.  NJMJr!.<br />PS:  The beauty of this film is the way it is portrayed!  IF LEFT TO ITS OWN DEVICES, LOVE WILL FIND A WAY!!  NJMJr!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual, I thoroughly enjoyed this poignant book.  Sparks keeps us in suspense until the very end, and provides much food for thought.
0385349947|4.0|I had heard some of the buzz about this book before I picked it up. Usually I don't do reviews, but I like reading what other people say about books.  I'm writing this because I think some of the reviewers are missing what is significant (at least) to me about the book.  Of course, Sheryl Sandberg is priviledged.  No one in my family would even dream of going to Harvard.  There are no doctors in my family. I don't make millions a year. I'm single with no children.  Basically I could disregard half of the book. HOWEVER, the other half really struck a cord with me. I've also been criticized for being too direct -- something that is not considered negative for a man. It made me think about how I approach meetings.  Do I speak up?  Do I wait for someone else to ask a question so I won't have to?  Do I sit at the table?  Do I have a voice that says I'm not qualified?  Am I an imposter?  Thinking about these questions made me realize that I can be passive about my career choices. There's a young man in my department who is new to the industry and training for his new position.  Every meeting he speaks up.  Even though some of his questions and comments are boarderline embarrassing, I guarantee upper management knows who he is.  It doesn't bother him at all to ask those questions. It's an interesting contrast to all the women just sitting there.<br /><br />The best message to take from this book is to be aware of what is going on in the workplace.  Take the opportunity to change the inequality.  Don't wait for someone to \\"fix\\" things for you.  When opportunities present themselves jump on them if it's what you want.  Take control.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|As with a lot of people reading this,I was not expecting David Bowie to make a follow up recording to his previous album [[ASIN:B0015XWUCC Reality]],which he released a decade ago. All the evidence in fact pointed to some type of semi retirement but that was not the case. He was apparently working secretly on this album,careful not to get too much of a pre publicity campaign going. How like Bowie to exercise such a meticulous level of control over the presentation and promotion of his art. He's a very difficult artist to follow,so honestly I don't know a whole lot about the production of this album or why it came to be when it did. All I know is that Tony Visconti is involved and that the cover art presents itself as a peculiar cut-n-paste variation on the [[ASIN:B00001OH7V Heroes]] artwork-with a simple square white box with the album title covering his face and the original title x'd out. So what has Bowie apparently (or allegedly depending on one's viewpoint) been up to in the creation of his next musical offering? And does it expand it any way from his 70's and 80's music?<br /><br />  Surprisingly it does. This is not Ziggy Stardust or the Thin White Duke. It's very much David Bowie,already in fact a character as his last name is Jones,obviously. He starts out with the title song,a very rhythmic dance/rocker that like the first single from this \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\",\\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"Dancing Out In Space\\",\\"Boss Of Me\\" and \\"(You Will) Set The World On Fire\\" define their strong song craft and melody by those layers of discordant drums,guitars and bass lines Bowie has always managed to combine in his music to create something somehow flowing and coherent. Of course being who Bowie is,there are many many surprises here as well. And those are actually among my favorites here. They include \\"Where Are We Now?\\",this expansive mixture of high pitched 80's style keyboard orchestrations with this rather stark Cabaret pop/rock style melody. There's also \\"If You Can See Me\\",which has a compelling mixture of Bowie's late 90's flirtation with drum 'n bass with the late 70's industrial dance/rock he pioneered on his Berlin trilogy.<br /><br />  \\"How Does The Grass Grow\\" is probably my favorite song here as it expands on that sonically heady fusion of pop/rock with electronica that defined his mid to late 70's musical explosions. \\"Dirty Boys\\" and \\"Love Is Lost\\" both have what I'd call an industrial blues flavor to them-the former funkier and the latter more stripped down. \\"I'd Rather Be High\\",\\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" and \\"Heat\\" are all intense and often very soulful epics that,in classic Bowie style,resist any real attempt at classification. Of the bonus tracks \\"So She\\" and \\"I'll Take You There\\" are both wonderfully orchestrated pop numbers whereas \\"Plan\\" is a two minute textured guitar instrumental. David Bowie and Tony Visconti are again at their best here creating this often very epic musical structures that are somehow intense and direct at the same time. They are the perfect setting for Bowie's typically rebellious romantic notions that define his lyrical send ups-either character plays or caricatured deconstructionism depending on ones viewpoint. While some might disagree,this is definitely an album worth waiting for. Not only does it have Bowie's ear catching sound musically,but there's a great deal of potential for an innovative type of commercial success as well. And in a more money driven music world,that's very much needed.Can See Me\\",which has a compelling mixture of Bowie's late 90's flirtation with drum 'n bass with the late 70's industrial dance/rock he pioneered on his Berlin trilogy.<br /><br />  \\"How Does The Grass Grow\\" is probably my favorite song here as it expands on that sonically heady fusion of pop/rock with electronica that defined his mid to late 70's musical explosions. \\"Dirty Boys\\" and \\"Love Is Lost\\" both have what I'd call an industrial blues flavor to them-the former funkier and the latter more stripped down. \\"I'd Rather Be High\\",\\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" and \\"Heat\\" are all intense and often very soulful epics that,in classic Bowie style,resist any real attempt at classification.

B008MEM24S|5.0|What a unique and challenging game only played one level<br />And I am HOOKED...IT EVEN GIVES ONE THE OPPORTUNITY to replay<br />A level (when you completed it but just \\"know\\" you can do better<br />Hope it doesn't keep me up to many nights ha ha<br />TO BAD THERE ARE ONLY 5 stars ;=O
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The story is almost poetic with wonderful descriptions. The characters were captivating. I couldn't put the book down. I will definitely read this book again since I feel I rushed though it the first time and the narrative and the story was so rich. I would recommend this book to anyone, even people that don't usually read fantasy, it has something for everyone.
0385528752|5.0|Yesterday, I sat in my office thinking about my boss' latest attempt at implementing an organizational change that, given the tenor of the department, has a small likelihood of success.  That got me thinking about my most recent set of New Year's resolutions, which (as of mid-March) are lying in ruins.  These failures left me wondering:  why are some changes so hard to make?  Having finished Switch, I now know why many changes are hard to enact, while a few changes are relatively easy.  Chip and Dan Heath depict the psychology churning in the background of a change attempt, describe the factors that sabotage a desired change, and present an effective plan for countering these factors.  The Heaths make their conclusions memorable by utilizing both a \\"down-to-earth\\" writing style and an impeccable narrative structure.  Both of these tools reinforce the lessons that the Heaths discuss, making the strategies they present accessible to the reader (and thus, more likely to succeed when utilized).  Most effective in driving home their points are the various examples of successful change they present.  The examples not only lend an optimistic tone to the text, but also inform the reader that sweeping change is possible once one understands obstacles to change and how to overcome them.  Even with these examples and tools, I recognize that successful change is still not guaranteed. Still, the comprehensive approach and detailed guide that the Heaths present in Switch give me reason to believe that the next attempt at change in which I'm involved (either personal or organizational) will be more successful than previous attempts.
0786956291|5.0|My group and I used this as a great starting point. We've already finished the quest included. I highly suggest finding a copy of the Players Manual as well.
B0027MJU00|3.0|It's a good read.  The story wrapped up well. Some parts are tedious.  I fought the urge to skip ahead.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|With this kit I'm able to upload photos from my camera cards directly into my iPad 1, which is one thing I wanted to do. However, I discovered that the kit does not work as a USB connection to connect my iPad 1 to a flash drive. The failure message says &#34;Cannot use device. The connected USB device requires too much power.&#34;
B004SIIBGU|4.0|SO easy to use.  I can search for items, easily.  Tracking items I have on sale is convenient for me.
B004EPZ070|3.0|Good, entertaining movie.  Recommend it to all who like comedy's on the romantic side. Six more words required, I hope this helped.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Simply put The Panther  is one of the worst books Mr DeMille has ever churned out.  It seems we can only surmise it was drafted to ring the cash register rather then create an interesting novel.  I cherish most all of his past writings  but cannot forgive him for wasting our time and money on this rather boring and purposeless effort.  He owes his public following a real story on his next book release.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I purchased this album with the expectations of it not exceeding Kendrick's debut LP... I was dead wrong. The truthfulness, insight, production, lyrics, flow and delivery all contribute to a cohesive, prudent, classic album. I don't throw around classic, and the last time I considered a hip hop LP to be classic was Brother Ali's 2003 Sophomore LP \\"Shadows on the Sun\\".<br /><br />At first glance if you aren't paying attention, several of his tracks appear to be just party induced/braggadocio fair. The head nodding production, and the catchy hooks along with the song titles are deceptive which is clever in their own right. You can play these tracks in clubs, but the message delivered is opposite of what you'd expect to be shared with listeners. Before I forget to mention it, do yourselves a favor and purchase the deluxe edition. The bonus tracks are all dope, and share the same vibes as the majority of the tracks on the main disc.<br /><br />I believe that many listeners may not enjoy this album if they aren't prepared to hear him speaking from his heart on issues that range from spirituality, to being a follower of what is perceived as cool/fun. He does it in such a sobering way, that many may view his work as being preachy. I found it refreshing that an artist (especially in the mainstream hip hop industry) was so willing to display this level of honesty with the world.<br /><br />If anything, I'd say give this album a fair chance, but I just want people to understand what they'll be hearing when they press play.<br /><br />As I said before, he throws you off with catchy hooks, and the smooth production and titles of the some of the tracks. But when you listen to tracks like Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe and Swimming Pools, you'll begin to understand what I'm talking about. The depth and truthfulness in his tracks allows for several listens. I believe it should be shared with those who are hip hop skeptics, skeptics of his work, and those who need to hear the words froma young man whom addresses issues on the mistakes that many of us make, but does not glorify them. I'll leave you with my favorite tracks on the album. Make sure to show your support for him by purchasing this album. I've bought two copies for a family member and friend.<br /><br />My stand out tracks are:<br /><br />Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe<br />The Art of Peer Pressure<br />Good Kid<br />Swimming Pools<br />Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst<br />Poetic Justice<br />Black Boy Fly (Bonus track)<br />The Recipe (Bonus track)
B0041D843M|5.0|Thought provoking and extremely interesting information! As a Midwest girl I never questioned the dairy/meat/&potatoes lifestyle until recently and have changed my diet dramatically. I feel great and love what I am eating now!
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|Whether or not your a fan of mo-cap, this movie is severely entertaining and beautiful to watch. The rendering of light and shadow and texture allowed me to forgive any reservations I may have with the uncanny valley of today's motion capture technology. The story is simple and well-crafted and fast-paced. It's Indiana Jones in CG with one of the most dizzying chase sequences I've ever seen, taking full advantage of CG.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I hated this game it is horrible and the worst game ever it is so boring. It is a waste of time and money.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I loved this game I got stuck on a few levles but my mom took my kindle and played it unroll she got everything unlocked and with three cartons
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Terrific insight into Alzheimer's in a very easy-to-read format.  No one close to me has had this disease but I feel much better prepared to understand it should that ever happen.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Really, really good. She did a great job of letting the reader know the inner feelings of the<br />characters and how flowers were involved. Would love a continuation book...maybe following<br />Hazel's life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun, very addictive. Ads are a bit of a pain but doesn't get in your way. Excellent way to pass time.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I'm a Baldacci fan & this book lived up to his standards.  I didn't understand the chemical &#34;stuff&#34; but<br />that didn't take away from the story line.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is great to do while waiting for appointments. I am enjoying it and find that it help me keep my mind sharp in seeing different ways to do things. Think outside the box.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Is all good. In the hood.<br /><br />I liked it a lot. I will read more books by her. Good book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|two enthusiastic thumbs up! I play it everyday. I think the graphics are awesome. what is that thing chasing me though? an ant eater on steroids?
0979019710|5.0|A good friend of mine (Joe, AKA \\"Who the heck is this Joe guy\\") sent me this book and I am and will forever be grateful to him!  This book is a must read for everyone!  it is inspiring, well thought out, simple to read and easy to understand for all ages.  The Miracle Morning\\", reminds us that life is a miracle and we can design a life of a \\"LEVEL 10\\" in all areas of our lives with EASY, BABY steps.  This book is guaranteed to set you on the right track and ignite your fire within.  BRAVO!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this.  When I go into my Kindle Fire the first app I see is this one and I can click it on and check the weather
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I saw it with my dad ,amazing. My<br />Mom wants to see it and wanted me to come my answer: HECK YA!!! I love the movie so much i could watch it 15 times if i could!
B0085A9HXS|5.0|This is one of the best action movies I have seen in a long time, if you like martial arts; it even has a plot: police storm a hotel loaded with criminals and have to fight their way in and then fight their way out.  I'd recommend it to a friend.
1846573785|5.0|I totally recommend this book to all my friends. This is an awesome book. Can't get enough of it. Wow!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is an easy read; very insightful. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. I think it can be life changing.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Wow! What a great story of an unsung American performer. I am glad I &#34;stumbled&#34; across this award winning, Sundance entry. It is a wonderful biographical piece on a Mexican American who should rank with American legends like Bob Dylan for their poignant, social commentary. His CVD's are master pieces, in my opinion.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This movie is a must see! Rented this movie for my 10 and 12 yr olds. They really liked it!
0439023491|5.0|I enjoy the author's style of writing and she maintains the reader's interest through her storytelling. I would recommend readers who enjoy a well written &#34;tale&#34; read both this and Book #1. The underlying theme of the 99% vs. the 1% is current to our, i.e. US, present &#34;class structure&#34;.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I love it.finally a coin game you drive in. hope you. ame a second one mabye in mountains.I have tons of ideas love to share them with you but good job.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game of conquering your natural enemies is highly strategic.<br />It is also a game of patience. I give it 5 stars for quality. It is fun, but it's not intense. It's a game and I rate it on what it proposes to be to what it is.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Osmos is one of those games that's easy to learn but has a surprising amount of strategy involved in it.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Not only did I get the CD but it came with a free download of the CD.  I was able to download and listen to the CD even before it was delivered.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Like all newer Clint movies, this movie has heart in spades, seems like it could be a real life event with slight dramatization added. Great acting by everyone, keeps your attention, and the old dude kicks ass in the end.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of Stephen King's movies, you'll probably enjoy this book.  He is really good at blending stories of his life and giving information on his process for writing.
1451695195|5.0|This book describes a doctors journey to heaven while his body lay on the bed. He describes in detail the whole account and was very good at describing the families plight and their feelings over watching their love one dying on the hospital bed in front of their eyes despite prayer after prayer and all the modern medicine failing to help. But what they did not know was the power of God. It was something bad that turned out to be something good. Incredible story....
B002BI6SMI|4.0|My husband and I needed something to help us survive a long flight. This was just the ticket. Action and suspense. Made the time pass quickly.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|It is fun but I have a lot of free time at work and it helps to past the time.  It does get boring over time
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|just relax. what a great little game. lt makes you think and slow down. I love it. one TIP; SLOW DOWN AND BECOME ONE WITH THE SPHERE.
B0037NB6QE|5.0|Love this book along with the whole series. After reading one, I purchased the whole series. I will be looking for more like these.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|best app yet. so fun. I like to give them rainbow crazy hair :p I highly recommend this app...so fun
B002GHHHKQ|4.0|From  the time she was a child, encouraged by her widower father, she was dazzled by the multitude of stars in the heaven. She was bright, worked with intensity and was able to study at the best training institutions. With experience in the field, she is now a young senior researcher on the heavens. Unpolitical, she is subordinate in her endeavors to the one who can speak to the people and institutions with money. Finally, there is a contact with outer space. She is crucial to the analysis of the data from which emerges a design for a space vehicle to bring the unknown entity out there and our world together. Who will be the first person to negotiate the trip? Will it be successful? That is the story of Contact, omitting the facts that should not known in advance. Jody Foster does an excellent job in leading a skilled cast which makes interesting what could have been dreary documentary or soap suds romance. Whether the tack taken by the creators of the film to round it off is satisfactory or not, is a question that should not be discussed in advance of the reader watching the film. In any event, it makes no material difference to the inherent quality of the production.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|Made me cringe at nearly every turn.... plenty of jump scares and gore, such as when (SPOILER) Pyramid Head rips the skin clean off of a character.... frighteningly good fun
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fast paced  and lots of fun.  Can easily get addicted.  Wish I could get better at it!  I'm such a spaz!
B00B01XDTI|3.0|The original Silent Hill had me covering me eyes and curling up in terror.... yet Revelation made me jump once. It can be considered gory, but not really a horror
B006LSZECO|3.0|The premise and structure of the book were very clever, and it was, quite often, a &#34;page-turner&#34;. However, the ending was, in my opinion, unbelievable -- mostly in terms of the actions of the lead male character. The female lead -- well, I guess that could happen. Change the ending (not necessary a &#34;happy ending&#34;, but at least one I can believe in), and I'd give it at least 4 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have accuweather on my desktop PC but this app is much better in my opinion. It also  seems more user frindly.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|This over hyped movie has no storyline. The only good parts of the movie is the dancing which is minimal.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|its okay, but definitely not worth 3 dollars.<br />it may turn out to be one of those games you play once, then never play again.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|The set designs were amazing, but it took away from the movies story line. I don't know what happened the first half of the movie.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|The movies looked great, the video quality is awesome! They also sounded amazing! I am very happy with this collection!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is an awesome read. I loved watching Charlie grow and learn about himself and his friends. Great read.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I really like calculator its very easy to use and is very high tech sometimes I can not even know how to work it I bet u my best friend Sidney could
0811879542|5.0|My son loves buttons. Any dot or circle would get a point and a press. How happy was I to find this delightful book that hit all the right buttons! Counting, colors and abstract thinking are all there in this easy to read and playful book. It will advance as he does so we will be reading it for some time to come.<br />We are quickly becoming fans of all of Herve Tullet's books! We own several and find them all educational, whimsical and fun!
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles, then you will love this app! It's simple and has tons of free puzzles to choose from!
B00479SVBU|4.0|This FM transmitter works great.  I have tried some FM transmitters in the past but it always seemed that the signal was too weak or the reception capability of my car is too weak.  This one, however, I can listen to music with decent sound quality.<br /><br />It seems that this product emits signal in wide range of frequency, not just the one it is set to broadcast.  Other FM transmitters I have tried emitted signal in very narrow range of frequency in comparison.  For example, if you set this transmitter to broadcast at 90.0 MHz frequency, you cannot listen to other radio stations near this frequency, say 88.0 MHz, without disabling the transmitter.  It's a bit frustrating if you actually listen to other radio stations, and it probably jams the signal for nearby vehicles too, though I have not confirmed this with anybody.<br /><br />It comes with a remote control, but it wasn't working for me at first.  It took me a while to realize that it has a very narrow reception angle for signals from the remote; in other words, you need to point the remote in very particular direction for it to work.  In my car, the power outlet is located in such a way that when I plug this transmitter in, it faces up and cannot be turned around.  The signal from the remote must be pointed at the face of the transmitter, so I have to move the remote directly over the transmitter and point the remote down to use it.  Not so bad once you get used to it, but frustrating at first.  Maybe I should have read the manual more carefully.<br /><br />And it's nice that it plays music from media like SD card and USB memory sticks.  I would give it 5 stars if it had bluetooth syching feature too, but for this price that's asking for too much.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely loved watching this series! My family is from Scotland/England and I always long to go visit. Looking forward to catching up with Season 3 after being absorbed with Season 1 and 2.
B0009X7664|5.0|How can anyone give a bad report to this movie and to Gregory Peck!!! It is beyond outstanding!!!  And with this particular one, there are several clips of his receiving an academy award, and scenes from the making of the movie.  It is truly a fine product.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|I think it was Thomas Wolf who said that &#34;you can never go home again&#34;, but if you love the Beatles or if you lived in the latter days of the sixties this is a time machine to take you back....the music is great, the singing is actually quite good and the acting is fine as well.  There are some really strange moments but having lived in the sixties there were quire a few weird moments towards the end of the decade....my goodness how things changed in the 70's.  A snapshot of relationships and the goings on in that period which will bring back memories.  But If you merely want a great love story with great music and performances, then this movie is for you.  Not well accepted at the box office but still a terrific and entertaining movie with a kinda cult following.  My whole family loves it and you will too....there is a tiny bit of nudity and some rough language so beware but all in all I can't recommend this movie enough.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|sometimes hard to accurately control and need points to buy new games which isn't always easy but good to pass time if you're bored :-)
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|If you are looking for an entertaining movie that can hold your attention for a couple hours, rent this. It has an interesting plot concept, is fairly fast-paced, and has lots of action. With that said, it's not a movie that left me with any lasting impression -- it is neither thought-provoking nor (despite the plot concept)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|The Wi-Fi Analyzer uses our router to find our available channels which are empty.  It also gives the channel strength, so we get the best service available for all our devices.
0307720950|4.0|Great book to kick-start the maker instinct in you. To be honest, you won't' find any detail data analysis or reference of published research etc. to support the 'why' part of the industrial revolution nevertheless the book lists the driving forces behind the revolution in a fairly easy, convincing and comprehensive way to make its case.<br />The list of companies, software, service bureaus or maker bots and their case-studies are a great resource for anyone trying to get their hands wet.
B0052AH9Z2|5.0|They sent me the same edition I had as a child in the '50's.  The pages are yellow with age, but the magic of the story is still there.
B000069KGM|5.0|It's so great to have all the music on one cd rather than having to turn a record over for side 2 then change records and then have to flip that disc over for side 4. The quality of the music sounds great on my 200w, 1980's amp and speakers. At the time this album first came out I was impressed with the horns as it was new for the rock sound. Their music is tight and always well performed.
B004GYY714|5.0|My son & I received our Kndle Fires for Christmas, and we keep finding amazing things that it can do.  He gets his favorite classic rock stations from LA, plus so much more.  I love classical and usually get them from the Internet.  Now I can bring them up where ever I go.  And it was free!
B004SDEP38|1.0|This app does not allow any editing in Excel.  You can only view documents.  Don't waste your time with this app.  Very disappointed but is was free.
0786948523|5.0|The book came in great condition and really what can I tell you about this book that you dont know.<br />Its a monster manual for monsters you put in a dungeons and dragons game.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|When I was a teenager, I had almost the entire run of Green Lantern / Green Arrow, and I loved them.  This series is Oliver Queen brought into something resembling the real world, and done well... VERY well.  I love the series, and it keeps me watching every week!
B007N8RULO|5.0|A delightful game of solitaire.  Once you get started playing it's hard to stop.  If you're looking for hours of mindless fun this game is for you.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The 'walker' part is secondary.  Love the interaction between the characters!  Makes you think, like Stephen King's The Stand made you think.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Good pace; story lines are interesting; acting well done.  I highly recommend this series.  Any Sherlock Holmes fan would enjoy
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Love, love, love this app... I have music on my phone thanks to this app :) I recommend everyone getting it now while it's still free :)
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I loved this book as much for the twists and turns as I did for the psychological insights into a relationship gone wrong, and the differences between the sexes in terms of attitudes to a relationship. I'll definitely be buying all of Gillian Flynn's other books as a result.
1452110581|2.0|The book was not very original. I guess I expected more. Not worth the money I paid. I'll be donating this one to a raffle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|best app ever so much fun/easy to use!! it makes school work easyier to use I would reccomend this app for any one who needs a calculator on the go
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series was very educational.  I was able to understand more completely of how the British Aristocracy fit into that country's history.  I was disappointed that the writers killed one of the main characters.  I'm not sure I will watch the rest of them.
B005HEPL8K|1.0|this season is the only one I have had problem with being out of sync the characters movements are delayed as is the voice. Otherwise I always enjoyed Star Trek: Next Generation
B0081336FO|3.0|This movie was entertaining, but I am a Sherlock Holmes fan and I much prefer the Arthur Conan Doyle books.  I'll stick with those for Sherlock Holmes adventures.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|I wanted to be able to upload the photos to facebook but the only thing I could do was upload it to their site. I don't want personal photos there.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I thought this was a great book. Her personal (mostly painful) life experiences are seamlessly woven into her current trials and jubilation on the trail, and also included basic history about some of the areas she hiked through.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Never had a problem with it and I love it. The other programs I have tried were inaccurate and this one has never been a problem for me.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This is a great game. The play is intuitive and the controls are fluid and natural.  Levels are appropriately challenging and scale nicely, with unlockable modes after each section.  I got this free, but would have paid.
B008XNPO20|4.0|It must get pretty lonely in the land of Kangaroos. Tame Impala now finds a singular sound in the cross-section of timeless pop and psychedelia. I was not disappointed when I bought it on Vinyl LP. It doesn't replace the 60/70s psych rock it embodies, but because it's a more additively fun listen than any other 2012 release that I can think of.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you're into psychedelia like Ty Segall, White Fence, Thee Oh Sees.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />Best track : Mind Mischief
B0026IUXME|5.0|This Holocaust account of Jewish life outside concentration camps was the perfect addition to my English I curriculum.  Great movie.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Not knowing much about the author going into this series made a little skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised with how good and easy to follow this series is. Long story short, I'm eagerly awaiting #4!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I hadn't seen an entire Bond film since THUNDERBALL.  I'd seen snippets of the insipid Roger Moore series which only made my interest in the character wane.  Happily, the Daniel Craig Bond is a welcome return to the good ol' early days...done modernly.
B00AFEY354|4.0|I readf the book first and enjoyed it however the movie was good, liked the book better.  More to the imagination, I guess.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I don't usually read mysteries but I loved this one. Great story, easy read, great writing. I will have to start one some of her other books
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Engaging characters and good storytelling. I'm only about a decade late. I need to go watch the movie again so I understand what's going on.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a fantastic read! Although the main character, Jonas, is transitioning from 12 years of age to 13, the book is wonderful throughout all the young adult ages--middle school is when I had my first encounter with The Giver. The book does not have anything that can be seen as too violent or sexual for middle school students. I reread The Giver for a college course, and I gained a greater understanding and love for the book doing so. One of the themes is perfect for young adults: finding one's individuality. Jonas is different from the rest of the community is many ways, so a young adult will gravitate towards Jonas because many young adults feel they are unlike the people around them.<br /><br />  Medication is mention moderately as an unnatural thing, which can reflect the growing number of young adults who are being put on medication (for ADD/ADHD), or to make the young adults rethink pill-popping to get high. Another, more sophisticated theme is about free will.  All of the citizens are give rolls and rules which they must follow. They must abide by these rules without fail, even if that includes euthanizing the old or unruly babies. The Giver says, \\"They know nothing,\\" meaning the citizens have no power to moderate themselves because they are products of what others tell them to think and do. Totalitarianism is what the community is portraying.<br /><br />  1984, another book I thoroughly enjoyed, is similar to The Giver because in both books there is no sex or love allowed; the setting is futuristic; the main character is a rebel; and the citizens are always monitored through speakers , cameras, or people keeping tabs on them. If you enjoyed 1984 chances are you will enjoy The Giver as well.<br /><br />  What I noticed while reading The Giver is that I appreciated many of the freedoms that I have but the citizens of Jonas' community do not have, especially how I can see in color while the citizens of Jonas' community cannot. Ending are always importantfor me, and The Giver really delivers. There are a few ways the end can be interpreted which lets the reader decide the desired outcome, or if you don't like to decide, let it be a small mystery.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|With the exception of track 2 , I loved all the songs. Great collection. Great for meditation and background music...
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Was looking for a new series to watch after finishing Downton Abby and this fit the bill perfectly. Includes interesting character development, historically guided plots, fighting scenes, and a little bit of romance.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey is brilliant! I am going to warn you ahead of time, that if you are not a fan of Tina Fey' s humor, then surely this book is not for you. While much of her humor is slightly crude, this book is a laugh out loud, keeps you asking for more quick read. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and my only regret is that I did not read it sooner.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I'd never read Vonnegut before, and I was impressed how the strange, sometimes ridiculous plot manages to keep your interest. I loved reading it!
0765325950|5.0|This series is awesome. I waited several years to get here. And I was not disapppinted. I want more. Raise the children let us have more soon. I want to know what happens next. I know Robert is no longer with us but the spirit of the story is and there can be more. Take us to the next level do back story or just continue on. This is fantasy and it can go anywhere. Please take us there. Robert would go with us if he could
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I have read all of his books and find them entertaining and they keep you wondering who it was until the end.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a great time suck..... Perfect for when you have to wait, for your car, an airplane, your kids. Whatever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Nicholas Sparks read. A little different from his others with the violence. Believable characters. Don't usually like books where the characters talk to fictional people. But well done in this book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a &#34;can't put down&#34; book.  I liked it so much I recommended it to my husband (we don't normally like the same books) and he loved it too!!
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Smart, witty, and easily one of the greatest shows on television. Watch the first season and I guaranteed you will be hooked!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put this book down - till the end.  The ending was disappointing, that's why I gave it 4 stars and not 5.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV a few years ago.  I never forgot it  and when I saw it on Amazon I had to order it. The fact that two people could comunicate and fall in love through a twist of fate. She in the year 2006 and he in the year 2004 and the wonderful magical mailbox that connects them.  This movie is one you will watch more than once. It pulls you in and you want so badly for everything to turn out for them. The dog &#34;Jack&#34; who was able to breach the the years between them was amazing. The casting of &#34;Sandra Bullock&#34; and &#34;Keanu Reeves&#34; was perfect .<br />I don't want to give anything more away about this movie, Just that if you are a romantic you have to get this movie. You could rent it, but I think it's one you will want to buy so you can watch it many times!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Fun game for me and my kids. Best angry birds to date IMO. If you enjoyed the previous angry bird titles, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoy Stephen King, this book is one of my favorites.  It has a great story along with the interesting history of JFK.  This book did not have the usual weirdness factor, but that was a nice change of pace!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I am a 30 year old male.  I loved this movie.  I generally love animated films but this one was really great.  Most people think this kind of movie is for kids but it was really great.  Fun and fast paced.  They had a few of those jokes that only the adults get.  Just a fun movie.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This movie was both cute and entertaining. I think anyone who has played video games will find something to laugh about.
0316077054|5.0|Totally different turn in this book, I was quite surprised and<br />angry at the flow of this story, but it was worth it. Don't let<br />this one scare you away, it only gets better.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Ceasul arata bine. Inca nu l-am vazut, dar am vrut sa las un review pentru romani. Sper ca bateria sa tina macar 1 saptamana daca nu e purtat.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I'm rating this app a five star because of the creativity of the plot and the challenge and diversity of the objectives that you need to follow. It's very user friendly but remains challenging at the same time.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app was very helpful with minecraft and now I finally can make my friends jealous! We play and have fun. I have made videos using this and found it helpful. I also have the pro version.
1451696191|5.0|I'll say it simply, since 4,078 reviews precede me.  This book brought me back in the most wonderful way to high school in the mid-1980s.  It's a really special book, and the film version is equally quirky, charming and wonderful too.  Did anyone else comment on the audiobook?  Johnny Heller's narration is perfect, it's one of those performances where the narration perfectly matches the story and mood.  I so highly recommend this book, and the audiobook, and the movie.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|This movie had me mesmerized!!!! I love the way Madonna wrote the script, I love Wally''s character played by Abby Cornish . I could see the pain and the longing and the passion that both women, Wallis and Wally craved throughout the film. I like the symbolisims with the W.E.  wallis and edward, wally and elvenghi, wallis and Ernest. I became so interested in this story that I have now become obessed with W.E.'s love story and It's really puts things into perspective regarding the grass is greener illusion. I bought a book on Wallis and I bought the soundtrack, THE MUSIC IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! this is one of my favorite movies and the music speaks their love story to your heart and soul! Thanks Madonna!
B00849F82E|5.0|This slender little book is a Chesterton classic, a good starting point for those who don't know Chesterton well. Don't be put off by the dry-sounding title,as the book is witty, insightful, and quotable. This is the kind of book you will want to own in print, as there are so many underlinable sentences. It is also a book you will want to re-read every few years, just for the experience that C. S. Lewis called &#34;refreshment of the spirit.&#34;
0061339202|5.0|This was my choice for a LONG plane ride after reading Quiet which I also highly recomend. It has clarified how to make a high tension job creative and fun again.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Highly recommend this book - especially for the last third where Ms. Moorjani writes to help us understand what her experience was like - in ways that often baffle others in how to express.  In my opinion, she wrote words which allowed me to connect with my inner most experiences and found myself nodding in agreement and feeling reassured.  I never did have a near death experience also I now know I had a transformative spiritual experience that I explained away in &#34;rational&#34; terms.  It is so difficutl to convey the depth, breadth and awesomeness of such an experience (for me) - that words fail me.  So I give a great deal of credit to Ms. Moojani for her way of writing which provided me with a sense of resonance......(see what I mean about words fail me?).  Highly recommend even if you have read other NDE books.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Nazis on the moon awaiting their chance to retake the earth? The Fuher Lives! The US with a secret space dreadnaught. YES!
030758836X|5.0|This was quite a surprise book.  Not your usual thriller.  I truly enjoyed the whole experience and I will most assuredly return to Ms  Gillian Flynn for more of this style again.  I do enjoy a book with a little surprise in it and &#34;Gone Girl&#34; more than filled the bill.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Not a big fan of Comics. Acting action and cinema graphics excellent. What is not to appriciate when the people have a hero(s). What I personally enjoy most is not alot of extreme gore and bad language.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I have had this case since April 2012 and it has been worth the money.  I like how it's slim and protects my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The only down fall with this is the 'spine' of the cover will become wrinkled because of opening the cover all the way, but that's expected if you plan to use this all the time like I do.  It hasn't shown any signs of cracking or coming apart!<br /><br />I take my Kindle Fire everywhere I go; work, families houses, etc.  It's always in my person.  But recently I noticed that on the back side along the bottom, the polycarbinate film is starting to crack and peel.  Weird thing is that it's only in one area.  I'm thinking it might have been from the heater in the car.... I don't know.  I'm also not sure how long these cases are supposed to last.<br /><br />If the film starts to get really bad, I'll most likely get the same case.  I haven't found a case that I've actually liked that was slim and covered the whole Kindle.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|lets face it, this isnt exactly a movie to win any awards, but if you just want to watch something that's fun and looks awesome, this is a great purchase. while i wouldnt pay $30 for this movie, anything under $10 is a pretty good deal
B002JVWR4A|5.0|i got these for my wife and kid.they love this show. they watched all 7 seasons in a week .
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|a lot of people didnt enjoy this movie because it either didn't answer their questions, or it wasn't the prequel to Alien they were expecting. firstly, movies don't need to answer every question to be a good movie, how many unanswered questions to have to the first Alien, or  Blade Runner for that matter. secondly, it was never supposed to be a direct prequel. it takes place in the same universe and is meant to tie some of the same themes together, its a parallel story that runs along side the Alien series. some have argued that their are plot problems, but any movie, no matter how good can be picked apart in this way.<br /><br />in any case, i bought this movie on sale for black friday and it was completely worth it, it was less than half price and for a fan of Ridley Scott, SciFi, or just anyone who wants to watch something interesting in both narrative and visual atmosphere, i recommend Prometheus!
B000I9YXKG|5.0|Great movie with a fantastic mix of humor, love and tenderness.  One of my favorites because it's not all just lovey dovey.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it.so nice.great awesome never can hate it fantastic lovely d!sad if u get hit.<br />Exsiting queen you to get seed whatever. Red faces
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The kindle version is almost as easy as the version on my PC.  I will probably use it just as often.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I love how the author put advice and action all in one in this wonderful book. It was eye opening for me.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I actually like the Kindle version of Pinterest almost better than the version on the internet.  Seems easier to flow through the different views, etc.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|Enjoyed the whole movie- the language is  little crude, but the movie has a lot of humor and is definately worth watching!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|AMAZING! Brought tears to my eyes ! (:  Charlie is a great and very sweet character and I enjoyed reading about his life !
B009MF5BXK|5.0|If you watched the old action adventures of Stallone, Norris, Willis and Schwarzenegger you will love how they make fun of themselves. Don't expect a great plot but it is a lot of fun.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|A really quirky movie that hails back to a calmer time.  It was very cute and I loved it a lot.
B000T45C6E|5.0|You cannot dislike this movie.  It is an excellent effort and has great acting of both Will Smith and his real-life son, Jaden Smith.  It gives us a snapshot of the real story of a man, down and out on his luck, but intelligent enough to seek and succeed at making a better life for him and his son, after his wife leaves them.  It's sad, poignant, well-acted and leaves you in the end with a very good feeling in your heart.  A good film to watch.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|My grandchildren love this movie - great family fun. Received very timely and have watched it 4 times already thanks.
B001FQFFMG|5.0|I am a fan of Johnny Cash.  I believe he was a very good entertainer and an excellent performer with a great voice.  Joaquin Phoenix did and excellent job in this film, in his portrayal of the Man in Black.  I was very surprised that he did not win the Oscar, although he was nominated.  This movie has excellent performance of Phoenix and of Witherspoon, who portrays his life-long love, June Carter.  Excellent performances of both actors.  A very good, entertaining, poignant film.  I recommend it for anyone who was a fan of Mr. Cash and likes country music.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I found this book overrated and predictable. It had an alright storyline but it was dragged out and repetitive. Not a bad read but not worth all the hype.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|The character who was once a law abiding citizen has turned into a vengeful person due to circumstances he's been put into.  This is a well-made, albeit violent film, who opens our eyes to how things really are in our current legal system and how in this case it must deal with its ramifications.  I like the character and understand that in seeking justice for him and his family, he goes overboard.  A likeable film.
B005JZBP8W|3.0|I don't know why this Blu-ray  was mastered from  a  35mm  negative,  but one can only guess the audio and visual improvements had Sony/CBS restored the 70mm print  instead.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 5 y/o loves all things Angry Birds but Bad Piggies is his favorite.  He loves figuring out how to put together the different vehicles for the piggies to work through the obstacle courses.  I'm amazed at how cleverly he puts together boxes, wheels, springs, balloons and engines to make each vehicle.  If you love creating and building, you'll like this version, otherwise you may want to stick with the more traditional angry bird games.
B004QX07G4|5.0|So funny I couldn't stop reading, thank you Ellen! I recommend this book to everyone. It is the definition of hilarious.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|And I bought it twice.<br /><br />This is The Complete Columbo -- all 69 episodes, for roughly a buck twenty-five per, including tax. It's an amazing (Amazon?) deal on *the* signature police procedural of the 1970s. And given that a third of the episodes run from 1989 - 2003, well beyond that decade.<br /><br />What I mean by buying it twice, is that I collected the individual DVD releases largely as they came out: I got the 1970s series for my wedding (yes, really) and then as new ones were sold, I bought them. Then, when the complete slipcased versions that are in this set released on my son's 20th birthday, I knew I'd be getting it to replace my aging versions. Now I have.<br /><br />This set has every episode, including the original \\"Prescription: Murder\\" and the pilot \\"Ransom for a Dead Man.\\" Then there are 43 episodes from the 1970 \\"regular\\" NBC series, and 24 of the later TV movies from ABC. You can get details from the usual sources -- some ran as 90 minutes with commercials, some were two hours -- and etc. etc. The only technical point: when the \\"first\\" or \\"old\\" DVDs came out, they ended up in 10 cases --<br /><br />1. Season One<br />2. Season Two<br />3. Season Three<br />4. Season Four<br />5. Season Five<br />6. Seasons Six and Seven<br />7. 1989 TV Movies<br />8. 1990 TV Movies<br />9. 1991-1993 TV Movies<br />10. 1994-2003 TV Movies<br /><br />-- with of course several discs in each DVD case.<br /><br />But with the new release of the complete series, there are eight cases, achieved by grouping 7+8 and 9+10 of the \\"first\\" / \\"old\\" DVD cases. But the discs themselves, within the cases, are set-up the same. So you'll have eight DVD cases (six white from the 1970s, two black for the 1980s - 2000s) in one slipcase box.<br /><br />As far as content, you may already have some experience of that. Or perhaps not. Either way you're in for a treat. Columbo is awesome. And, as Victor Kiam might say, I liked it so much I bought the company: I'm writing The Columbo Case Files, and consequently have spent a lot of time watching these episodes again and again, thinking about the stories, then writing on them.<br /><br />Oh, and just one more thing ... ; ) ... the DVD cases are all plastic now, with the slipcase a solid cardboard. Previously, under the old / first releases, the outer cases were thin cardboard that began to fray after a couple dozen viewings ...<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the complete series.<br /><br />Thanks kindly,<br /><br />Paul<br /><br />Ps / Below are links to three of the ebooks I've written on Columbo. There are eight or so now and there will eventually be 15, including 10 on all the shows.

B00B7IJBUY|1.0|Now presenting one more time, for your listening pleasure, its John Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and company, offering um....displeasure instead of tracing back to the roots of rock that put them on flipin' map in the 1st place! Unfortunately, we get a rockless performance from start to finish! This really sucks for their fans today and for many who liked them better when their music was much more Slippery and Wet! Once you hear this mellow garbage, you'll want to \\"Runaway\\" as fast as you can! No \\"In And Out Of Love\\" found! In 2013, Bon Jovi just gave no LOVE and A BAD NAME! \\"WHAT ABOUT NOTHING\\" would be a better album title!<br /><br />What an unfortunate batch of disappointment from these guys like never before! What The...? But Why? Really? Are You Kidding Us? Absolutely no real-rock passion, no power, no energy, and zero balls heard here! This tired-sounding debacle-of-an-effort is not worth LAYING YOUR HANDS ON at all and way too tender for the likes of the Jersey shores! All that can be said about now is NEXT!!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|nothing new have seen it before. Acting was good, not realey into cia movies. it was somewhat suspensful , it was ok.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's a good time killer. Although the levels can get frustrating, it's addicting until you complete them. There needs to be a cheater's guide to help solve some of the levels
0345529057|5.0|This is a fabulous read!  It contains all of the elements of a good story no matter the genre: well developed characters who are multi dimensional and that you actually care for.  I am looking forward to the last one with a combination of anticipation mixed with lingering regret that this journey has to come to an end.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well researched and extremely well written to review a fallen Hero's life and purpose.  Every word brings you closer to him as you read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game!!  We love it!!!  All 3 of my kids love this game!!!  I highly recommend this game!!  My kids favorite game!!!
0307719219|1.0|It was around page 50 when he started discussing the different theories which have been used in the past to explain the inequality, such as Jared Diamond's based on geography. I was irked, no, incredibly angry how the author went to almost completely dismiss all of Diamond's work and omit several important points that Diamond made (mainly that main part about you know, guns, germs and steel). The way I see it, both theories can work together, its not an either or, but the culmination of many factors. It didn't feel like the book was attempting to get to the root of the truth. It felt as though these two authors wanted to promote their idea as the correct one, and dismiss what ideas have been mentioned in the past. I think there was a lot of validity to what they wrote, but, not completely.<br /><br />For some reason reading this book felt like watching the Presidential elections. Saying the same things over again, a lot of blab without giving much of real substance, only choosing the facts that support your hypothesis and not confronting and attempting to explain those that don't.<br /><br />Wish I hadn't spent the 13 euros on it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Ok game. Fun when your just sitting around. Downside is that it's a typical energy/turn based game. But can be entertaining otherwise.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Granddaughters loved receiving it for Valentines's Day.  It was fun watching it with them. laughing and for me bringing back memories.
B000F3UAFC|4.0|I discovered this movie because I have always had a thing for Helen Hunt from Mad About You, Castaway, Twister...  She is aging a bit (aren't we all) but this was quite intriguing. Throw in Scarlett Johansson and we have even more chemistry. Not a 5 star, but one I had to add to my library.
B0033TJATW|5.0|My show horse is in this video.  Of course I love it and think it's the best Michael did.  This is a part of my life's history.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This is a great case because it's simple and streamlined.  I was afraid it wouldn't offer much protection but I feel confident that it could handle a short drop.  I have never dropped my phone so I can't say how it will hold up.  But it allows the beauty of my white iPhone 4S to shine through.  I fiddle with it pretty frequently and take it on and off, and it hasn't broken yet.  It is also not discolored after 6 months of use, unlike other who have reviewed the item.  Good value for the money!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter season three was still another killer season with much more drama, tension and killing of characters in the show.  Of course the ones being killed are mostly gulity and done by Dexter.  I will give some season three highlights inculding spoilers, Dexter tries to make a true friend with Migual, Deb tries to get her dectective shield while trying to decide if she wants a relationship.  Dexter finds out he is going to be a father, and get married to Rita, as the season keeps going Dexter realizes everyone has secrets and \\"some doors shouldn't be opened.\\"  The main villian for the season is called \\"The Skinner.\\"  But for everyone a fan of Dexter proved to be an season that ended up being good in the end because of the fact no matter how many times Dexter thinks it's going to end he finds a way to win and keep on surviving.  But if you think Dexter is the true mastermind even he gets used or played by other characters and he realizes that with Miguel because he sees he isnt who he seems. But in the end I won't ruin the ending for all fans of the series you will just have to buy season three to find out for yourself.  I watched the whole season three in 4 days so yes keep my intrest all the way threw.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|VERY GOOD movie, Ben Affleck is outstanding, both acting and directing; so glad this won so many best picture awards! The movie arrived in great condition, packaging was very good. Happy I purchased this!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|I am a Jeffery Archer fan and cannot wait for the next episode to be written - THE SOONER THE BETTER.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I'm using this for the past 1 year, this unit is working fine without any issue. Swivel sweeper is very comfortable for quick cleaning. You can't rule out the vacuum machine, but pulling out the vacuum from storage and repacking it back is a big process for me. I'm using the Swivel Sweeper to clean any visible dirt in my carpet and kitchen flooring. Till date I didn't face any problem with battery or the pole. Swivel Sweeper can't be a replacement for your vacuum machine, but it helps you a lot for quick cleaning and to keep the house always neat.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Me and my wife finished the season in one weekend. Loved the new characters introduced in this season. Can't wait for Season 3.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this app. Jurassic Park is good for all ages.Its exciting and relaxing.My husband and I are both building our parks.Mine is better ;) Get it you'll like it.  KathyG.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|When I first started the book, it felt a little boring to me. But as I got past the first couple  &#34;setting the stage&#34; chapters, i became fascinated with what it was going to mean for the protagonist to be &#34;the messenger.&#34; And of course Zusak has a way with words that is fascinating and brings a scene home like no other. It just might call &#34;the messenger&#34; out in all of us. Everyone can make a difference in someone's life. Just listen deeply for what you are meant to do.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is a great series.  I wish they had done some of his mind tricks in the movie.  I plan on reading the rest of them.
B009PMB3CI|2.0|The graphics are great. There are many problems with the game and here are  a few:<br />1. You can not keep the clothes you dress your dog on them. They disappear when you leave the dress room.<br />2. When dancing with the dog there is only one button you press at a time.<br />3. There should be a way you can have neighbors and visit them.<br />4. There should be more kinds of dogs instead of the Dalmatian you will get tired of the sane dog.<br />5. As a new room it would be fun to change the color of your dog.<br />6. You should be able to have puppies and teach them tricks. It would be fun to mix dogs and be able to sell them. Another room :) ( a room that would hold the ones you want to sell and then you could go to a market.)<br />7. It would be fun if you could buy stuff at a store to decorate the rooms and buy food and supplies rather than having to level up to get them.<br /><br />Sure this game is fun maybe for the first three levels but after awhile it gets boring. Add this stuff and I am positive hundreds Will flock to this game and will have to have it. I think it would be so much fun. (Just try not to make a lot of the stuff to where you have to have neighbors like selling the dogs. You could fake sell them. Like more people will come to your booth or room if the decor is better) Hope you take this all in consideration.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I don't like that I can't look and do some of the things I can do on their normal site, but there is a spot on the app to choose to go to the official site, but by then why not just use the web?
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I got it on HD and the picture quality was so amazing. My son love it annd would recommed this item to anyone.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|So worth the wait ! Reading the books prior to each new season and it has been so enjoyable . Excellent acting and set decorations .  The actors chosen really bring these characters to life . I am a forever fan and obsessed with game of thrones !!!!!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game! I would recommed this item to anyone who enjoy play shark game! I love it and it a great purchase!
B00913DPW2|1.0|It was a total waste of time to download this item I was very disapointed in the quality. Sorry but, never again.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I'm liking this better than when I first played it a few months ago. Maybe I'm focusing less on the \\"story\\" and more just on the music; like a lot of story/concept albums, the overall story/concept is perhaps a little complicated, or distracting, at first, considering that the songs are kind of snapshots of moments -- the music is more accessible if one just takes them as songs and doesn't worry about the continuity or the narrative \\"in between\\" ...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great history, great acting, wonderful set and costumes.  We can't wait for the next season to start. It's a must watch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book!  One of the best I've read in a long time but really wished it would have ended differently.  Very disappointed in the end.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|This is a great story ruined by a weird director.  The first half of the movie is shot in such a bizarre way that it's distracting for the story.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is one of my favorite books for my kid! This is the number one book for any kid it is funny and my girl reads the books over and over again
B0062NAX1U|5.0|One of the best movies ever made, i've watched it over a 100 times so far and still love it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Its not everyday that a comic gets turned into a tv show or movie or yes it is However where this one differs is its actually different enough to have you guessing and simalar enough for recognition of somethings. i would and do reccomend this to everyone, my 3yr old son watches it and doesnt get scared my wife is a different story MUST WATCH MUST OWN TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE AND HERES TO MORE AND MORE SUCCESS AND SEASONS WALKING DEAD F-ING ROCKS
B008VBYN80|4.0|It takes to long to gain gems for certain quests, and I don't like having to use them as part of the introductory playing the game. Other then that the server is soggy so it doesn't as always register my gameplay..but it's fun. Maybe change the way someone can just attack you randomly, give more opportunity to protect oneself. The shield should be more accessible.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I really like the game pad. Works great for WoW and the like. So much easier to move around with the thumbstick and of course the hotkeys are nice. Average hand here and it fits great.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Love it you all get on getting the package to the customer. I am very pleased thank you so much and keep up the work. You all are better then McDonalds. I'm lovin it. Thank you great job you all are awesome.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Great graphics.  Great music.  Fun and challenging.  One of the best games for Kindle.  You won't regret this purchase.  A

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just started watching Downton Abbey this season...am so totally hooked. Went back and watched Season 1 and in the midst of Season 2.....loving every minute of it, can't wait for Season 4....in spite of characters leaving.
B000UG4LYU|4.0|I walk into the music section and there it is. Like a flying saucer from out of nowhere, it sits on the shelf in front of me. People have talked about, they have seen photos of it, but hardly anyone has ever heard it. It is not supposed to be there, not supposed to exist, but there it is anyway.<br /><br />That was 2007. The album that was released in 1993 was at long last available for public consumption. It has been my most played Bowie disc since that time. The last *new* Bowie album I bought until \\"The Next Day\\" came out yesterday. It is decidedly un-commercial. Which is part of the reason I like it.<br /><br />\\"Black Tie White Noise\\" reached #1 in the UK but failed to sell well in the US, partly because Bowie's American record label was having so many problems. Because of this Bowie did not tour for it and was able to turn right around and work on another project. The book \\"The Buddha of Suburbia\\" was being turned into a miniseries for BBC TV and Bowie was asked to supply the soundtrack. Bowie completed several short works made from combining guitar, synthesizer, trumpet, percussion and sitar.<br /><br />A month later he teamed up with Erdal Kizilcay, extending those short works into longer loops and adding overdubs and vocals. In a week he had composed a new album. Released in the UK and Europe in November 1993 as a soundtrack album, not a Bowie album, his best album in a decade was never heard. Yet this is David Bowie's favorite David Bowie album, and the one that got him back into making more creative albums. It is a transitional album, tying together \\"Black Tie\\" and \\"Outside\\".<br /><br />Slow to fast ~ the album running order:<br />1 The Mysteries<br />2 Ian Fish UK Heir<br />3 South Horizon<br />4 Sex And The Church<br />5 Untitled No. 1<br />6 Strangers When We Meet<br />7 Buddha of Suburbia<br /><br />`The Mysteries'. Like the sun rising down a hallway in an Egyptian temple, this song evokes wonder. It is at once the most beautiful, elegant and understated tune that he has ever recorded. This was accomplished by a wash of synth matched with backwards piano and guitar passages. Then the recording was slowed down to produce the desired, dreamy effect.<br /><br /> `Ian Fish UK Heir'. I don't know who he is but when you first hear his song it just seems like noise. It is deceiving, because it is actually layered with instruments. The first would be the plucked acoustic guitar. If this was all you heard you could say it was a traditional song. But far in the background you can hear a piano running a set of high notes over and over. Then there is the static. Is this to make it sound like a vinyl record, or like machinery coming over your radio? The machinery is supplied by what sounds like three synth parts. There is the sound of something spinning. There is a long drawn out siren like sound. And there is the actual drone which makes up the bedrock of this song. All in all it is a very interesting piece for those who take the time to decipher it.<br /><br />The end of this drone meshes well with the start of `South Horizon', as we hear a jazz band warming up. Piano, bass, cymbals and drums get into a groove. Two and a half minutes later the actual song starts. This is Bowie's favorite song on the album. While the two ambient instrumentals, `Mysteries' and `Ian', sound like backing tracks on \\"Outside\\", `South' would feel right in place on \\"Black Tie\\". Like `Looking For Lester', this song is a cool groove, a happy little shuffle.<br /><br />It ends with tickling piano, and now we hear a keyboard warble. A percussive beat and treated vocals leads us into `Sex And The Church'. We have suddenly gone from ambient to jazz to progressive music as easily as walking from one room to another. Once more we have a happy bouncing groove as Bowie wonders about the joys of the flesh coexisting with religion. This song would fit right next to `Pallas Athena' on \\"Black Tie\\". It ends with a woman trying to catch her breath after the act. And telling you she loves you.<br /><br />Now we come to `Untitled No. 1'. This song is much more poppy but the overall sound fits in well with what we have just heard. What started off as a mellow album has now become loud and up front with this bopping number. All is happy and well as Bowie's treated vocals tell us next to nothing as to what this song is about, what is he saying? \\"City of fools... it's clear that some things never take\\"? And this seems to be what he is getting across to us.<br /><br />The bounce becomes more pronounced now as `Strangers When We Meet' hits home. Speaking of home, Bowie mentions his flat screen TV, and this in 1993.  What is weird that the `Strangers' we hear here is much more power progressive here than the piano version found on \\"Outside\\", which according to each albums flavor, is backwards from what we should expect. Bowie re-recorded it for that album because this album, due to record company problems, was never going to be released. He knew he had a winner and he wanted it heard. Why he wanted to lighten it up I do not know, but it fits much better at the end of \\"Outside\\" because it provides a much needed relief from the bludgeoning one goes thru after an hour of listening to that album.<br /><br />At last we get to the Buddha himself. `Buddha of Suburbia` may be the best rock song here, with tight acoustic guitar, bass and synth grounding us to an early period Bowie. His early instrument the saxophone, gets the first solo, while his later instrument, the guitar, gets the last one. It is a good way to end the album on a high note. It is all about being English and growing up in the suburbs, then moving on to the city of London, which seems to be what the book was all about and what Bowie actually did. He had seen UFO's when he was young, and the song ends with a flying saucer taking off. Do yourself a favor, take the trip.<br /><br />Now if he would just release a proper recording of all the missing \\"Outside\\" takes.<br /><br />4.5 Starsnd telling you she loves you.<br /><br />Now we come to `Untitled No. 1'.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is way better than regular temple run! Once you start playing the game, you can't stop because, it is so addicting! This game is really fun!!! I would recommend this game to YOU!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|The Next Day<br />You open the album already influenced by \\"Heroes\\", and that is exactly what you start with. If I heard this a few months ago I would have sworn it was an outtake from that album, or \\"Scary Monsters\\" at least. Think rough rockers like `Beauty And The Beast' and `Joe The Lion'. He may be older but you would never know it. It ends too quickly though.<br /><br />Dirty Boys<br /> A sexy strut for a cigar girl, or a cartoon cat, making their way thru a smokey club, past a combo of sax, bass, drums and a snarky guitar. Like \\"Monsters\\", the second song sounds a bit different, but like `Sons' sounding different then `Beauty', it still fits. Probably due to the production, as the sound seems to match. Like the first track, it is too short.<br /><br />The Stars<br />Starting out with a 1:52 intro that is very \\"Heathen\\" sounding, the video version of this seems more of a complete song. For some reason they left the intro off the album version. As it is, this still sounds very heathenish to me, with a dose of \\"Reality\\". Whether that is due to the production or the vocal style or just the overall sound, I do not know. If I had heard this song not knowing there was a new album I would have thought it was an outtake from either of those albums. Many of the trademarks of those last two albums can be heard. Where \\"Heathen\\" was more basic, leaning more on mood, \\"Reality\\" had more going on, which at times was too thick. This has the requisite rock instruments as well as what sounds like a synthesizer laying a tone over all the satyrs and their child wives. A good rock song, one which already sounds familiar.<br /><br />Love Is Lost<br />Moody and full of beat. Weird backing vocals. Would have fit next to `She Drives The Big Car', might even be about the same girl. Definitely a studio track, probably not something that would ever be played in concert. Nice guitar touches that seem like they are coming down the hallway.<br /><br />Where Are We Now<br /> This one is too smutchy for me. Maybe because it is the only one that shows his age. The drumming is nice, but it does not do much but yearn, which may be the point of it. It seems out of place. Won't be on my playlist.<br /><br />Valentine's Day<br />This is guitar rock from another era for sure. The song, like his vocals, sounds like it was recorded in the seventies. Way too short. I guess we should be happy that the older crowd will be listening to this; otherwise we could expect another senseless shoot up on Valentine's Day. Should school killings be getting turned into songs? Won't that just make them want to do it more?<br /><br />If You Can See Me<br />Here is one not suitable for younger listeners. This is the wack track. Skittish drumming and hurry up vocals. I might not be playing this one either.<br /><br />I'd Rather Be High<br />Another early seventies song. How does he do this with his voice? He has not sung this high for ages. Solders lying in heroine fields, who would rather get high than kill. If you can picture the Spiders doing a Vietnam song, then you will have this one down.<br /><br />Boss of Me<br />Low key Sax again, for a boy stuck on a girl. The slinky pace makes this one. It would fit better right after `Love Is Lost', as it has that slower, measured feel to it. It is not country, but this is a song that a country artist would want to record for their own. Look for it on \\"Nashville\\" next season.<br /><br />Dancing Out in Space<br />I must have cowboys on the mind, because I can see this as a line dance. Another out of nowhere track. Are we doing the fifties now? Starts off good but dumb lyrics drag it down. `Lucy Can't Dance' is much better. I am surprised he did this one. Skipper.<br /><br />How Does the Grass Grow?<br />Another wack track moment, as the \\"Lodger\\" shows up out of nowhere. This one is hard to fathom in its changes. Some good beats with party down chants. Might have been instantaneous fun to play, but it is going to take a while to nail this one down. Those voices grab you though.<br /><br />Set the World On Fire<br />And we are back to \\"Scary Monsters\\" again. This should be a fan favorite. Chorus oriented guitar rock that most people could sing along to the first time they hear it. If he does a concert you can expect to hear this. This and 'Stars' may be the only songs that can stand up with `Everybody Says Hi\\" and \\"New Killer Star\\".<br /><br />You Feel So Lonely You Could Die<br />This is a good song but this too seems out of place. The `Five Years' ending does not help. Would be stronger going from `Fire' to `Heat'. Skipper number four.<br /><br />Heat<br />David Bowie doing Johnny Cash? This is a cross between `Bring Me The Disco King' and Duran Duran's \\"Dirty Great Monster\\". Which is a good thing, but it is not as strong as either of those. A toned down ending to an album that is much better than it should be, if that makes any sense. Looking at al the 5 star reviews I thought I might at least like this one. I am really impressed. This is really good!<br /><br />So She<br />Sorry Bon Jovi, but Paul Anka has dibs on this one. Bowie takes us back to the fifties in polka dot style. Too short to make much of a dent, more of an after thought<br /><br />The Plan<br />This short droning instrumental should have been used as an intro to the album. That is where I will play it. Oh sneaky David! I just realized that this is the intro to the `Stars' video. Alright! Would have made a good album opener to ease you into things.<br /><br />I'll Take You There<br />Apparently he's not afraid of Americans anymore. Talk about radio friendly, this sounds like a travel ad. This is the catchiest song here. This one should have been on the album. It is way better than `Where' and `See', though it is way too short. I spent about twenty minutes in the store trying to decide if I wanted to spend the extra three bucks on the Deluxe Edition. I cannot make that judgment for you, but for me, these last two make it worth it. I will be playing these last two songs in place of those I skipped.<br /><br />So is Bowie's new album groundbreaking? No. But it is a welcome extension to his catalogue. Better than I expected it to be. His last two albums had two songs that I skipped, so in that regard it is not up to the same level, but this one has more songs. \\"Next Day\\" seems to be all over the place at times and is in dire need of re-sequencing to make it flow better. Individually, the songs may be stronger than \\"Heathen\\", whose power lies in the moody images evoked by the entire album as a finished piece. Can they match the best songs on \\"Reality'? Maybe.<br /><br />The images evoked here are of \\"Heathen\\"s, Heroes\\", \\"Lodger\\"s and \\"Scary Monsters\\", with a touch of \\"Reality\\". If you liked those albums, this new one should appeal to you.  As strong a comeback album as most could have wished for. At the very least it wins the prestigious \\"Worst Album Cover of the Century\\" award.s one down.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|I enjoyed it so much  that I watched all discs on the same night.It was like reading a book that you could not put down omce you started it.
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Just when I thought the musical landscape was becoming barren . . . folk revival, blues revival, (which are fine, but why revive things? We need to progress!) even disco is rearing its ugly head in TV commercials with a nostalgic fondness . . . the Chameleon returns! How any Bowie fan can not be excited about this release, and not love it, is beyond me. \\"Not the Bowie of Ziggy Stardust?\\" Duh! Bowie has never repeated himself - he's always challenging himself and his audience. I for one, am glad that The Next Day is what it is. (Although, the album cover absolutely sucks . .  .) A great collection of songs by one of the last remaining true artists we have. Cherish every moment, people! Bowie's Back!
B008B68IEA|4.0|This is an attractive, if basic, bed for Monster High. It's well themed for the snow theme but lacks the uniqueness of Draculaura's bed. There are holes along the bed for mounting the accessories, and the accessories are nicely considered. A step above a basic Barbie bed but not exceptional for the Monster High line. Worth having if you are an Abby fan.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I love this movie more than my mom (mom's response: nice!) - I watch it all the time.  I really like Jack Frost and I love the Tooth Fairy and all the good guys.  I love watching it with my momma.<br /><br />Momma's response: She really does love this movie and asks for it constantly. I have to say I love it too.  The animation is awesome and the music works perfectly.  Jack is a reluctant hero, but absolutely a hero.  The balance of what each Guardian brings to the world is lovely, and the balances of the different Guardians across the world interesting, though that aspect went right over my little one's head. And I want to be careful not to spoil, but Jamie/Frost's interactions rock - esp near the end.  I don't know what the plot would be, but I hope there's a Rise of the Guardians 2 in the works somewhere. We would absolutely buy it.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|THE RAID: REDEMPTION is one of the most successful movies I've seen in YEARS.  It's not the greatest movie, by a long-shot...but the gap between its ambition (which is pretty high) and its actual accomplishment is almost non-existent.  I've long believed that movies need to be judge, in part, on how well they accomplish what they attempt, and not just how \\"good\\" they are by some high-brow, artsy standard.  Thus, a low-brow comedy like KNOCKED UP can get 5 stars from me because while it isn't great art, it meets or exceeds all its own goals.  And by the same token, a gorgeous, ambitious, \\"serious\\" film like, oh, let's say ANNA KARININA only gets 3 or 4 stars, because its reach so far exceeds its grasp.<br /><br />THE RAID: REDEMPTION is darn near perfect.  It wants to be a nearly non-stop, adrenalin-fueled, ultra-violent, martial-arts heavy action movie.  It tries to strike a balance between incredible tension and the visceral release of that pent-up tension.  It wants to shock and awe.  And it does.<br /><br />Set in Indonesia, we meet a group of heavily armed and armored cops who are planning a raid on a very tall apartment building.  At the top of this building sits the city's most vicious crime lord, along with his two cruelly effective henchmen.  Beneath them, for floor after floor, is a seemingly endless string of bad guys, the scum and villains of the town.  The cops must fight their way from bottom to top...and once their presence is exposed the viciousness and intensity of the fight is nearly ceaseless.<br /><br />The movie, while not based on a videogame, is the best example of a videogame movie I've seen.  Granted, that's a low bar...but THE RAID clears that bar so effortlessly.  The action sequences, which start with gunplay and then devolve first to knife play and then hand-to-hand combat, are among the best I've seen.  I've never been a huge fan of the MMA/martial-arts type of combat, where the hero and his foe kick, punch, block, flip, etc.  But I've NEVER seen so many fights staged so brilliantly or executed with such brutal fervor.  This is no exaggeration...during some of the action sequences, I found myself on the edge of my seat, talking to the screen (or yelling at it).  I simply DO NOT do that, yet I couldn't help it.  I was engrossed and engaged.<br /><br />Yes, there is a bit of a story.  We are introduced, perfunctorily, to several characters and we do learn a few things about them.  There is even a bit of a surprise relationship that is revealed late in the film.  There are moments for dialogue and for catching a breath.  I wouldn't say the dialogue is brilliant or the acting Oscar caliber...but it is a little better than one might expect.  Iko Uwais plays Rama, our young hero...and he's a convincing screen presence (and a helluva fighter).  This is the kind of movie that relies on archetypes to gives us a shorthand for understanding the characters.  The heroic rookie, the guy with the smart-aleck remarks, the leader with a secret, the potentially corrupt higher leader, the insane bad guy, etc. etc.  What THE RAID does, however, is take these stock characters and put them in nearly perfect motion for maximum impact.  Gareth Evans wrote, directed, edited and co-choreographed the film.  In my mind, his is one of the most singular accomplishments in recent film history.  Again, his goals are not exactly lofty or ennobling.  But I can barely conceive how he managed to succeed so well where so many others have tried and failed.<br /><br />This is a brutal film, and many viewers will not be able to finish watching it.  Some will find it glorifies violence or is just deeply depressing in its depiction of insane violence.  For me, it was a rush from start to finish.  It was a punch to the gut, but it was somehow uplifting as well.  It's simplicity of plot and tightness of purpose set it up to succeed beyond anything I could have expected.  I had heard it was good, but was skeptical.  \\"Surely that's just fanboys and genre nuts talking,\\" I said to myself.  But I was wrong.  Evans and his talented team delivered one of the most thrilling movies I've seen.  Wow!
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|I don't recommend this book to anyone.  I think it's boring and uninteresting.  Hopefully, some people will enjoy it, but not I.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Nazis and a Brazilian stronghold. Maybe I tire a bit of Agent Pendergast's bizarre personal life and wish he'd start solving other people's problems but I must admit that the action here and the plethora of answers to old questions was very satisfying.

B00B4VXQC8|1.0|The more traditional \\"rock songs\\" are just that - nothing new at all and we've heard them all so many times before.

B008J34466|4.0|Pink is a great songwriter.  She pours her love, her joy, her pain, her betrayal and her wicked sense of humor into her songs.  She is truly an entertainer.  I'm not offended by occasional swearing.  It's Pink.  If you listen to her speak, you shouldn't be surprised by her lyrics.  Having said that, in some cases I think the language detracts from the song.  When she calls her lover and a-hole, it's perfect. There is no better word to describe him and I think everyone can relate to someone in our life.  Other songs the expletives are just so plentiful and gratuitous that I wonder if she had this great tune in her head, but no lyrics so just filled in the blanks with s***.  Either that or she lost her thesaurus.<br /><br />On the whole, it's another great effort from Pink.  I just wish she could express herself with more creative adjectives.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The character is a young boy who is starting to doubt the existence of Santa Clause. Trying desperately to believe but having only evidence that Santa is a fallacy the boy ends up on a journey filled with Christmas \\"Magic\\", faith and belief. What makes this movie so good is that everyone can relate back to the time in their lives when they to were starting to doubt and where desperate to cling to the last bit of magic. This movie does such a good that the viewer not only explores this time in there past but actually feels like they are a kid again trying to believe. The story, musical score and affects/scenery are so good that you may forget you are watching a movie and believe (for a little while anyway) that it is actually you on this magical journey. After the film ends you can feel a little bit of the residual magic in the form of that tingly anticipation we all remember oh so well. An excelant movie that \\"bring back the Christmas Magic\\" of childhood and will leave you with a warm feeling and sense of wonder.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is both soothing and challenging. So unique and easy to grasp, I love it! Lots of depth as the levels diversify.

B00498YZH8|5.0|Well acted, vivid portrayals. Jennifer Lawrence gives a great performance. Not a feel-good kind if movie but definitely worth a watch.
B009X01ELC|5.0|this case is great for my new Fire HD.  i love that it can be rotated completely around. when you close the case it shuts the screen off to save power.  it holds it very securely. it has nice padding. it has slots that will hold the FireHD in 3 different angled positions.  i would say the only con is the elastic to hold it closed is not very usefull. but i do not use it either.  a great case.
B00499NHLC|5.0|We really enjoyed this first season of this series. It is witty, smart and fun. I am excited to watch season 2.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We starte the walking dead and can't get enough.  It's really good.  Not just all zombie.  We rented the first two seasons then needed to catch up on it through Amazon.
B0026772N8|4.0|As a neophyte in Philosophy, I found the explanation of underlying forms to be illuminating. The book caused me to consider the things that science cannot explain. I felt like the book would be life-changing until the abrupt and out of character ending. It felt like the end to another book, or written by another author. Definitely worth reading, just don't allow yourself to believe that epiphany will follow.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I found this to be a very entertaining read. It's a clever and new story.  I would recommend it to those 12 years of age and up, although there are a few swear words dappled here and there, as well as some violence.  The story moved at a good pace, making it hard to put down sometimes.<br />I read it on my Kindle and the handwritten letter illustrations were very hard to read.  The photographs were a bit hard to make out, too.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have never written a review before. I hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about Bowie.<br />The first thing I want to say is that &#34;If this album doesn't debut at #1 this week, then all hope is lost for rock music&#34;. Every song on this this disc is excellent. There's no filler. The two tracks that have been gettin a lot of airplay are &#34;The Stars Are Out Tonight&#34; and &#34;Where We Are Now&#34;. They are both great songs, but check out &#34;I'd Rather Be High&#34; and Dancing Out In Space&#34;. David has gone back to the roots that made him an icon. These songs would fit in with his 70's & early 80's but are fresh enough for today's style. It's nice to have an artist who still writes his own music and plays instruments. (No GaGa/Bieber here).<br />I admit that David Bowie isn't my favorite all time artist, but I can recognize a really great album when I hear it and for the first time have something to say about it.<br />Thank you
B0074PNCRM|5.0|this book was an incredible novel bordering on literature. the unanswerable questions that aren't often asked are to be found within this novel, and i was genuinely moved to tears in one moment and laughing my head off the next
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I am on my third time listening to this cd.  It sounds great...i find myself singing along already.<br />They sound great...just like always.<br />If you are a Bon Jovi fan...by all means ...go for it!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love it.  When I can't go to the gym, this dvd brings the gym to me!  Highly Recommend.  Thank you!
B00BSHVSQ4|1.0|Really?<br /><br />This is a silly price.  I can't think this is deserving of this price tag, beings as though the blu ray version (Non special edition) is under $30.<br /><br />I read the list of stuff included, and I don't see anything that would cost someone $230 more dollars.<br /><br />Put this in a realistic price range.. at this price tag I would expect some Eagle concert tickets.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good read, but it seems that the author dragged out the beginning & the ending surprise twist. But i did enjoy it.
B0051E9JNE|5.0|I have always loved this movie! When I saw it on prime I had to watch it. It never disappoints
B004TI5N38|5.0|I love David baldacci books and now I fallen in love with John Puller. What a hero. Can't wait to read other books he is in.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|Excellent adventure based on true battles. The food,medicines Saling all spot on. Historically accurate and the tail captivating. Reading the whole 22 book series a second time and is just as enjoyable as the first 10 years ago.
B00B5A9FLY|1.0|I throughly enjoyed the whole series, even when it was a little uneven.  So I was really looking forward to buying the series with the commentary.  I started at the last episode, hoping for some more ideas as to where the main characters had ended up.  Instead there was a shoddy, puerile voiceover from Katie MacGrath and Julian Murphy.  It felt like being slapped in the face.  Don't bother buying the boxed set for completion.  It was an insult.  The fans deserved better not least for the abruptness of the ending after some quite patchy episodes.  Not worth it.
B004KD5TQI|3.0|the product was new and came as scheduled. But the actual soundtrack was missing some of the best songs from the movie.
145210655X|5.0|This a great book for a Star Wars fan to read to there kids. And it's at a great price.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|These two are an amazing team with a unique sound! Each song leaves you wanting more. I just saw them at SXSW - their shows are like no other!
B005USZYDU|4.0|This was a fast paced and enjoyable read. My only complaint is that it ended too abruptly. I don't mind a cliffhanger, but this book did not end leaving me on the edge of my seat. Instead, it left me thinking \\"that's it?\\"
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years.  I can't wait for the next one.  Truly an original.
B009E3EY38|5.0|As a Zeppelin fan this was great to see what probably will be their last performance together. Plant/Page/Jones really laid it out. Very impressive.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years.  I can't wait for the next one.  Engaging story line
B009NX88JU|5.0|This film hits very close to home. Long before you ever heard of Iggy Pop, Mr. Stooge was licking my Kodak Instamatic lens at the Mt. Holly (MI) Pop Festival.And when Russ Gibb was investigating the purported death of Paul McCartney on WKNR, I was both a clue provider and rabid listener.
B0076DELIG|5.0|harry bosch novels are my very favorite , i collect very one of them and this one certainly lived up to my expectations.
B003V9OCS8|4.0|While I watched this show in chunks over a five day period I found it to be very intriguing.  Subtitles were a little small on the Iphone but great on the ipad.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My girls absolutely LOVE this game! I've bought the full version for all of the Dr. Panda games and have never been disappointed. That being said, I didn't hesitate to purchase this new release and you shouldn't either! Supermarket is hands down the best. I haven't actually taken the time to establish how many mini games are on each app, but I honestly think this one has the most.<br /><br />Not only are there the typical supermarket responsibilities of scanning and bagging groceries, but also a few behind the scenes jobs such as collecting the carts from the lot and restocking the warehouse. The variety is truly amazing, and as with all of the Dr. Panda games there are little tidbits of knowledge hidden among all the fun! Highly recommend.
076115678X|4.0|and very informative book. definitely would recommend this to anyone who want to go the natural way of hair styling or anyone who like to pursue a curly girl life style of hair care.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The blu-ray really kits on all cylinders. I would highly recommend this over DVD.<br /><br />However, this it the &#34;new&#34; version of 4-6, just a heads up.
B005URRCUY|5.0|A great 'throwback&#34; album!<br /><br />Some of their  music reminds me of Stevie Winwood's old school band. &#34;Traffic&#34;<br /><br />If you have been looking for some music you can relate to, this just might be it.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I liked this because it had a lot of action and humor  and a guy turning into animals. You should like it too.
B0091LS07E|3.0|She is Alicia Keys!  You have to listen to it, but if I am comparing it to her other work I am not that impressed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|we started watching season 1 and were hooked!  the history, the story and the acting is terrific.  we look forward to catching up with all the seasons and appreciate watching it on amazon.
B008NW67E0|4.0|but I sure don't  think I will need to buy anymore of their music,,,, it all starts to sound the same!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the plot and the unexpected twists. Can't wait to read more by the author! Couldn't put it down. Exceptional writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was very addicted and I played almost every single night on my kindle. It is a very fu and creative game. Well doned
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I'm really starting to like this app. Two things I would like to see changed are give the ability to set the individual sound levels in a given mix and move the sound store into the app instead of launching a browser.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very well thought out fun and addicting.<br />It's free too what more would u want really just as fun as Xboxes rendition
B0045JYHQA|5.0|It was so nice to listen to this album again. Just as good as I remembered.<br />Janis could really rock!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This was the most emotional book of the series and I loved the characters that the author created for this edition. I believe this tells the perfect story for how all of the madness in the other novels began. I hope Dashner continues to write and comes up with another idea as successful as this one.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Well written, great plod, good acting, very enjoyable to watch, many surprises, ending was the only letdown - have fun
159514188X|5.0|When I first found this book and read the little excerpt on the website I knew I had to read it. So, I rushed to my nearest book store and purchased it (which is a bit exciting for me since I just got a new job and I can actually BUY things other than gas :D). I rushed back home and settled down in my reading chair with my comfy reading tie blanket and read.<br /><br />I ready 2/3 of it that first night and then finished it the next day. I was captured right away, which can usually be a bit hard to do. Sometimes it takes a chapter or so to really get into a book but this one had me by the first page.<br /><br />Now, on to what I think. I really think this book does really show how little actions and really mean a lot to someone, but like someone said before, some of the reasons were a bit flimsy. Now I do know that some of the reasons were pretty bad, but they shouldn't lead to suicide. I realize in the beginning you kind of side with her and think that after the first reason, everything gets worse. But later on they get just even more ridiculous which can show how the 'snowball effect' really works. By then she was already crushed so every little action against her really took a toll on her. Now I've had a rough childhood, I was always picked on and ridiculed by fellow students and teachers. It's really left some emotional scars on me. On some of her reasons I can really understand her, but by the end I grew angry by her refusal for help. Which I understand was the authors intent.<br /><br />Now on to Clay. I absolutely love this character. I feel terrible that she put him through all of that emotional trauma basically just to apologize. I realize she also did it so he could understand her more, but I think that was down right uncalled for on her part. He was one of the people that really wanted to help her same with Mr. Porter.<br /><br />Overall it's a really good book, I couldn't put it down I would definitely recommend it.
0553593714|5.0|Let me start of by saying that I have not finished this book but I couldn't wait to start my review.  As I continue the book, I will add to my review.  This is not my typical review as I tend to write about the book as a whole but this time I want to concentrate on the central characters in this first book.<br /><br />As you read the reviews already posted, most will tell you what the book is about so I don't even need to go there.  I will however add that this book had me hooked from the very first page.  I can rarely say that of many books.  I wholeheartedly agree with all who say this is one of the most engrossing story ever.  I believe the reason for this book sucking you right in is due to the portrayal of the characters.  GRRM is a genius storyteller that gives all of his characters depth so that you feel strongly about each of the main characters.<br /><br />Here are is my summary (I suspect most will agree with me but feel free to disagree):<br /><br />Ned Starks-The King's hand and Lord of Winterfell.  Perfect man for the job although I squirmed along with him when he was offered the position.  How can you say no to the King who is also your best friend?  He comes across as cold, serious and rather moody at time but I like him.  You can tell that he is a man who will do what is right, no matter what the cost.  That is integrity.<br /><br />Catelyn Tully-Ned's wife.  I can't really relate to her as a woman.  She doesn't come across as warm, caring person.  You only really see her maternal side when she is dealing with her son Bran.  What really made me not like her as a woman was the way that she deals with Jon Snow.  Jon is Ned's illegitimate son.  As a woman, I can understand her emotions towards Jon but as a mother I know that you can't make a child pay for the father's sins.  Her obvious hatred of Jon made me dislike her.  I think I might have liked her a little if she had hidden her intense dislike for Jon because I do understand her anger and jealousy but she just flaunts her hatred in his face making me feel bad for Jon.<br /><br />Robert Baratheon-Although he is king, he certainly doesn't act it.  I think he likes the title but not the responsibilities that go with being King of the Seven Kingdoms.  He isn't a bad guy but he doesn't have a backbone so he really disappointed me.  Maybe now that Ned is by his side, he will step up to the plate?  I don't think so but one can hope.<br /><br />Queen Ceresei-Cold-hearted bitch (need I say more???).  I hope one of the dire wolves kill her just like she had one killed.<br /><br />Jamie Lannister-Ceresei's twin brother.  I think he might have turned out not as evil as his twin if only he had cut the umbilical cord (metaphorically speaking) that binds him to his sister in more ways than one.<br /><br />Tyrion (the Imp) Lannister- Ceresei and Jaime's brother.  He is continually ostracized by everyone and hated by his own sister (see what a cold-hearted bitch she is) because he is a \\"midget\\" and an ugly one at that.  I like him very much as I think he is smarter than the twins and unlike them, has a heart.  He also provides comic relief in a book that is full of drama, betrayal and suspense.  What's good about his character is that although he is a Lannister, I am not sure where his loyalty will lie once they are truly tested.  If I am right about him, I believe he will do what is right and not do what is wrong out of family loyalty.<br /><br />Jon Snow-Ned's bastard son.  One of my favorite characters because he knows his place in his father's world and he doesn't go around feeling sorry for himself because he is a bastard.  He acts more like a true born than some of his half siblings.  I see good things in his future, if only he survives.<br /><br />Bran-One of Ned's younger son and Catelyn's favorite child.  I like him because he doesn't seem to have a bad bone in his body but I don't know what's going to happen with him.  Don't want to give out any spoilers.<br /><br />Ayra-Ned's youngest daughter, a skinny, scrawny scrap of girl that will end up surprising us all.  I like her because she is a rebel.  I think that she will be like her father and do the right thing.  I like that she treats everyone equally including Jon and seems to have more royal blood in her veins than her older sister, Sansa who is to marry the King's son, Joffrey.<br /><br />Sansa-Ned's oldest daughter-prissy princess.  She is her mother's daughter as she treats Jon like a bastard rather than a half brother.  That alone makes me not like her.  She also doesn't stand up for what is right and blames her sister for everything that goes wrong.  The fact that she is engaged to Prince Joffrey just sealed my dislike.<br /><br />Prince Joffrey-King Baratheon's oldest son and heir.  He is as priggish as Sansa is prissy.  They were made for each other.  If they inherit the kingdom, the kingdom is doomed.<br /><br />Danaerys-Dragon princess.  Forced to marry a total stranger in order to help her brother regain his throne.  I feel sorry for her but I think as the story progresses, she will summon up the courage and make her brother stop taking advantage of her and take her rightful place as the remaining Dragon Princess.<br /><br />Viserys-Dragon prince.  I understand his anger but I could not like him for selling his sister in order to regain his throne.  It is the custom of Dragonstone that the prince brother should marry the princess sister in order to keep the royal blood line pure but in this case I am glad that he doesn't because he is a bully and too wrapped up in his misery and angry to make a great king much less husband.  I hope Danaerys inherits the kingdom because a man so obsessed with revenge will only destroy himself rather than those he seeks to avenge the death of his family.<br /><br />There are many more characters in this book but so far these are the main ones who have grabbed my attention, one way or another.  As I continue the book, I might change my mind about how I feel about the characters as GRRM has a way of surprising us. You might end up loving a character you first hated and that's what so good about this book, you really don't know where it's going.  Don't you love reading a book that is totally unpredictable?  Of course we all love happy endings but in real life, the unexpected happens and life isn't always a fairy tale.  Maybe that is why I am enjoying this book so much, my first fantasy book.<br /><br />PS.  I bought the first season DVD and let me tell you....almost as awesome as the book.  Of course I am reading the book first and watching an episode or two to see if it stays true to the book and it does.  The special effects and cinematography is out of this world (PUN INTENDED).<br /><br />As always, feel free to comment on my review.  I like hearing people's opinion even if they don't agree with me.>Ayra-Ned's youngest daughter, a skinny, scrawny scrap of girl that will end up surprising us all.

B00BBQXQFI|5.0|I have actually bough the DVD and bough the movie on amazon so I can watch it from iPad and IPhone. Very cute show!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It took my friends several years to get me to try using Facebook....now I am hooked, like most of the nation.  I love having it on my Kindle, so I can check whenever I need (or want) to do so!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose this book after seeing the feature film of The Hunger Games. I must say this one took me on a full ride . I was not expecting most of what I read while I could not believe I reached the last page. This is a must read for all.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love the pace of this game...it can be lightening fast, or take your time....it's all up to the player!  It is simple to learn and lots of fun!
B00797MB0O|1.0|Don't waste a moment of your time watching this film.  The lead character has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Like the lead character, this movie is shallow and disappointing.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|When you have robots meet mixed martial arts what else can you ask for.  This is a great action packed movie with a nice under lined story line!
B004I744AS|4.0|I love the Dictionary app by Farlex because it it's easy, versatile, and fun.<br /><br />No longer do i have to visit and wait for a web page to finish loading before i can look up a new word that i just read. I simply open the shop, type the word, and easily have three or four definitions in seconds.<br /><br />What if i want to know how to say a word in another language? No problem.  Dictionary it's a versatile, robust app that not only does a word's country of origin, but also offers on-the-fly translation with virtually a mere click of a button.<br /><br />Being able to learn new word in both my native tongue and other tongues is simply fun for me. Good job Farlex.
B0098460O4|5.0|So amazed by these two individuals vocal talents.  They take modern day hits and present them in a way everyone will enjoy!  Bravo to both of them on a great piece of musical works!
B009KKLQVS|3.0|The picture and audio quality are great (I have the blu-ray version) - however - the synchronization between the audio and video is quite a bit off throughout most of the DVD. You would think the producers of a DVD of this stature and importance would pay a little closer attention to the production values/details.<br /><br />Also, where's the other half of the concert ?? Is this just a &#34;teaser&#34; to get the us (the fans) to buy the full show at a later date ?
B000002J27|5.0|Trick of the Tail, Wind & Wuthering and Foxtrot are their best albums. They didn't go commercial and platinum until Then There Were Three in 1980. Trick, Wind and Foxtrot from the 70s were their best work. The band wasn't the same after losing Hackett and Gabriel.
B00061Q83Q|5.0|This album is still my favorite album of all time almost 10 years after it first came out, and it was great to finally hear it on vinyl.
0307730697|5.0|Unlike some, I buy a book without expectations. I'm anxious to read it, curious about what's contained in the pages. I judge a book by how well it's written, quality of the story, and how it holds my interest.<br /><br />This book gets an A+ on all three accounts. Eric Blehm did a wonderful job of telling Adam Brown's story. I have no idea how many interviews he conducted, but it must have been well into the hundreds. His story of Adam is told by those who knew him best. Eric put it all together in a relevant, important, and powerful way. The book is largely devoid of foul language. It contains a few mildly foul words which were quotes from others. These instances were relevant and appropriate. I think it's important to mention this because it opens the book up to a whole new audience who normally shy away from military books because of the language.<br /><br />Eric Blehm was trusted with telling Adam Brown's story, and he did a fantastic job. Thank you Eric!<br /><br />As for Adam Brown, he is a true American Hero in every sense of the word...
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I have listen to this cd at least 25 times and really enjoy all the songs.  I plan to check out their prior cds.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I thought the 2nd book was the best. I did not care for the depressing feeling as the story continued.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has good graphics. The scene is not the same course you always run ,it changes each time. Great time killer! Easy and difficult all at the same time! Love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|There should be the nether and the end  Yeah it is a lot of fun I play survivable mode and play on peaceful until I make a house and a sword
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this series! I could not put the books down. It is extremely well written and a must read.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Want to see this live...but in the interim loved watching on computer!  Instant stream is awesome!  My daughter and I loved it!
B004EPYZQC|3.0|Nice carton cover, but i didnt like the real cover; it has a different picture and really looks like a poor version.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was the first app I got for my kindle fire I have had my kindle for a while now and this spp Is still my fave!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Newsfeed doesn't update, refreshing anything is slow or just stops working. Worst kindle app right now. For now, I'm deleting this app. P<br />lease fix!!!y
B000CNEO1G|5.0|Alison Balsom has the most wonderful trumpet sound. And what can be better? - Bach and trumpet? I can listen to this all day long, every day.
B0081336FO|5.0|Our whole family especially my 14 and 10 year old boys love this series.  We are looking forward to the next season.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I chose 4 stars out of 5 because I do not like how it views. The files I have with adobe are not like pages and you have to make sure you center the pages you are viewing yourself. This will be a even better product if adobe fixes this.
B003B02O0A|5.0|If you're not a Grisham fan, this book might make you one.  If you are a Grisham fan, then you'll probably agree with me that this is one of his best works.  I simply could not put this book down.  I wish I could give it an extra star!
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I like this LinkedIn app. I do not like the fact that sometimes the recommended jobs pop up late but other than that easy to navigate and stay connected.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is a tool any busy person should have to keep things organized and accessable from just about any device that can connect to the internet.  Compared to Microsoft's OneNote, it lacks a few features.  It also lacks the hefty price tag. OneNote is probably better and easier if you have Microsoft Office, but it's hard to keep it sync'd.  Evernote just works and stays sync'd.  I also use Google Docs and SkyDrive.  When used in combination, you'd be missing a valuable resource without Evernote.
B00APJLFEG|2.0|I am an adult who often enjoy animated features but this one was not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Pros: The animation was high quality and fun to look at, the colors were vibrant, some fun cameos from voice actors. I enjoyed some of the jokes, most of which were in the previews.<br /><br />Cons: The story was really predictable from the first ten minutes with no surprises at all except how very long the vampires could be in direct sunshine without, you know, dying. It tried too hard to be emotionally compelling without enough humor to make that unsuccessful attempt bearable.<br /><br />Overall I would not recommend it to adults unless you have children who want to see it. :-)
B003B02O7I|5.0|From the beltway to the Amazon, this book will keep you turning the pages.  In addition to a riveting plot, you'll probably learn a few things from this book.  Grisham fans will not want to miss this exciting book.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Time travel is always a difficult topic to wrap my head around because of the paradoxes.  My husband and I certainly had an animated discussion over what timelines could and could not be possible - if you do a thing NOW has it always then happened in the future?  Can you affect your older self thirty years later in a moment or would the effect of your actions ripple through the whole timeline immediately and always have happened once you've done it?  AAARGH  :-)<br /><br />Anyway watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt channel a young Bruce Willis was a treat.  He was amazing, the story was gripping despite breaking my brain and I enjoyed it very much. It was really violent and gory though so if you are sensitive to that sort of thing it might not be for you.  The main characters are not valiant and a lot of people die in variously gruesome ways.  The violence mostly served the story and only seemed a little extra gruesome in spots - nothing that keeps me up at night like the extra disturbing moments cut out of the original theater release of the Sixth Sense.  I was reminded a bit of the Butterfly Effect which I also thought was a really interesting and thought provoking movie.<br /><br />I recommend it, but only to adults who can handle a fair amount of gory violence in a movie.
B003B02PFO|5.0|The story takes a few turns you'll probably not expect, but that's what I like about Grisham's books.  It'll also keep you grinning.  If you're a Grisham fan, then you should put this book on your list.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I sometimes wonder how far is it from reality.  imaginative story and good chemistry between the characters. We are enjoying this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very entertaining. I like all of the challenges that it gives you. I just wish some of them were a little easier. And that there were more power ups.
B00B1MJ02K|4.0|at least 2 or 3 of the songs are not very melodic.  Also, some of the songs are not at the same volume level. Additionally if available would give this 3.5 stars instead of 4 stars.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I am grateful that I don't have purchase something to continue to enjoy. Too many games require additional purchases to finish a game. I really dislike getting an app and then having to uninstall because I can't continue without a purchase. Great job on a game that works really well with no hangups.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Terrific acting, writing. Big fan of Damien Lewis. He and Clare Danes have a real chemistry. I would recommend this show.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|I've been a fan of Tegan and Sara since the first time I heard \\"City Girl.\\" This album hardly disappoints! When I saw that they came out with another album, I had to buy it and I'm happy that I did! I've had the itch for more Tegan and Sara and this album is amazing.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have used this for our vacation planning.  From driving directions and maps to pictures and daily to-do lists.  It syncs from my kindle to my computer so no matter where I am putting things, I always have access to my notes and plans!

B008RA3X5E|5.0|No Need to take an alarm clock on vacation anymore.  Hotel alarms don't work well & I hate wakeup calls.  &#34;My Alarm Clock&#34; allows for Digital or Analog Display of Clock.  Has sleep timer and can wake to music or sounds. Full Screen display makes it real easy to see.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I haven't been able to put these books down, so well written and although you can predict what you think might come next you are wrong. Some of the best books I've read in a long time!
1935597760|5.0|This was a beautiful story set in 1970s Ireland, with flashbacks to the '30s.  Christina McKenna certainly has a talent for bringing her characters to life and endearing them to you.  Yes, I cried, but I also laughed out loud. I can't imagine that there were such cruel people in the world to victimize children this way. It's heartbreaking to look behind that curtain.  It was very touching see the changes in Jamie as he struggled to open his heart and take a risk to escape his loneliness.<br /><br />My hope is to see this made into a QUALITY movie someday, but it would be a travesty to see it land in the wrong hands. (I kept seeing Mrs. Pattimore from Downton Abbey as the character \\"Rose\\".)<br /><br />Make sure this is on your reading list!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|AND ITS GOOD! oh man! Was I happy when I saw a rebuild of a classic anime that I grew up with as a child! It take the classic story and gives it a new life! Many are shot for shot of the classic Eveangelion, but freshens it up! If you like Evangelion! I would give this a chance because it does it pure justice!
B004XQO90E|3.0|I believe that Duncan Jones has read the novels of Franz Kafka (The Castle, The Metamorphosis, The Trial) or has seen the films based on those novels. Kafka wrote his novels in the early 20th century: The Trial was written in 1937. Even then the discoveries in physics, especially quantum theory, were revolutionary, and time travel was a major topic of research.<br />In both Moon and Source Code the protagonists encounter questions of identity and confusion about whether they are alive or dead (or someone else). The lead actors receive orders from their superiors that are often relayed to them by women, who are always sure of their authority, while the men often end up fighting each other. Like Kafka novels, where the main characters often turn into insects, the Duncan Jones characters often don't know who or where they are.
0785153322|5.0|A great collection of the art book of the Marvel Studios film! I love all of these movies and been a fan of the concept work of the films and I am very glad that they decided to reprint the Iron Man art books for this collection, I didn't want to pay an outrageous amount of money for the Iron Man art book! This is a perfect collection for any fan, movie or art wise. They have a standard layout throughout the books that I enjoy, it takes you from early production art, concepts that were used and not used and variations of different ideas and so many other little elements that make it a great art book!
B002T9H2ME|2.0|I am not a big fan of science fiction, but I really like science fact, e.g. The Universe, How the Earth Was Made and Through the Wormhole. Moon is too much of a downer for me. I liked Source Code better and Danny Boyle's Sunshine was interesting. I would not put these two blu-rays in the same ring as 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke. I note that some reviewers here believe that every new release of science fiction is the next 2001. In my opinion, Kubrick is the greatest American film director even though he made almost all his films in England. Why? Because he hated the American studio system, where producers had total control of films released (Kubrick wanted total control of his films, which he had with all his films after the release of Spartacus).
B007N5YIUS|5.0|A great fun but the games quits very quitly to buy the game. The space games are a lot of fun while I had it FREE for a short time.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book.  Ms. McKenna has a gift of precisely relaying details and painting a very clear image so that the story is visual in your mind.  It is at times painful to read about the cruelty inflicted upon our most vulnerable children and then it is heart-warming to read of the kindness of strangers and  mostly encouraging to read about the resilency of the human spirit.  I will look for more books from this author.
0307120007|2.0|As a book that is meant for a child to touch, I was surprised at how fragile this book was made.  The cover is thin cardboard and the spiral binding does not appear like it will hold up well.  It is also teeny tiny.  I definitely should have read the reviews and product description better.  I bought this for my baby's first Easter basket and was hoping for it to be a keepsake for him.  I suppose it still can be, but only if I don't let him play with it until he is much older and knows how to be gentle with a book.
B004NYQYNQ|4.0|Adele is a great singer with some really good songs. However the songs are a bit repetitive between each other often giving me the feeling that it is a continuation of a previous song. Not necessarily a bad thing.

0061137456|5.0|This book was shipped to me while I was on a deployment in the middle of the ocean! It shipped very quiickly. The poetry in this book is shocking and sometimes offensive, but uniquely written. I have the original and it's amazing to see the notes written by Ginsberg himself in this edition.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|This is great. i live in a rural area with no high speed internet. with this i can pick up my system and go to a friends house and play. easy to travel with too. i just went on a trip of about a week with it and carried it on the plane with me. it would get five stars if it had its own power supply. but i love it.

B000NTMWYU|5.0|Beautiful scenery of Provence, France, a nice romance and reminder of keeping in touch with family before its too late.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|this game is fun but on three occasions the game will go to load and kicks me off and back to the kindle home page. the only way around it was to delete the game and redownload it. this is happening to me now even after the update.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|I enjoy sci-fi movies and most of the family surely lets me know about it but I really enjoyed the movie
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My oldest daughter recommended Dexter to me and I finished all 7 seasons in about 2 months.  Seasons 4 and 7 are my favorites so far.  Excellent writing and characters that are not untouchable make this a compelling series.<br /><br />Season 8? Bring it on!<br /><br />: )
B004SBQAN8|5.0|this is one of  the movies  I rally hope the movie company follows up with a sequel for the rest of us
B00B2V66VS|1.0|My coins disappear when it reaches a certain amount, which makes any upgrades impossible to buy, which in turn makes the objectives nearly impossible to do. Its not a properly made game. It could be a lot of fun if fixed.

B006RXQASA|5.0|Intelligently funny, and a classic movie about getting out of your own way. The duality between Randall and Donte is the perfect conflict we all seem to struggle with.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The most engaging series ever from the Brits. Without fail, the casting is superb and the lives of the classes during that time in history portrayed so eloquently.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome  game plz play this game and make your own review  I love this game and u will to trust me u will to
B007KWD7BK|1.0|And hour of stupidly slow riffing, and awful vocals which take away from the only thing remotely cool about this, the lyrics. (And I guess the cover art is pretty bitchin')<br /> It's two and a half minutes of ideas streched into an hour of what sounds like middle schoolers drunkenly jamming. It's horrible and I don't care how much weed you smoke, if I was a record exec and a band brought this into me after giving them an advance and said 'this is our new album, take it or leave it,' not only would I not release it, I would sue them for my money back, and I would have the album destroyed to protect others from wasting their money on it.<br />Crap!
B0076DELIG|4.0|The plot is good, but not his best. I love Harry. I can't wait for more. His approach is always interesting.

B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is one of the few sudoku apps that I really play. I've tried others but they're either too easy or too hard. With this app you have choices in puzzle levels, according to what you feel like playing at the time. The only thing I would change is to reset the timer on each set of puzzles so you can see your best time for each level. It would be nice to see what set you did best on. Otherwise it's great fun.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Arrived on time and as expected; package had been abused a bit but the contents were in perfect shape.  Good job on the packaging, Amazon!    The good parts of this review: The eggs are too cute. The movie comes with Blu-Ray, Standard DVD, and a Digital copy unlocked by using Ultraviolet.  While i don't use Ultraviolet because their system was still buggy when I first bought something that used it (Green Lantern) and I still have problems getting through their system, I don't need the digital copy at this time.  Because it's not necessary to my enjoyment, I only detract a half-star and cannot 'round down' here, so.  This is generally a good packaging of a very good movie.  I'm not going to review the movie itself... well, OK, a little.    The cultural characters of Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, all came from a series of beautifully illustrated, fanciful children's books, by William Joyce, which are described here at this website: [...]    Joyce recreates the characters completely from their embed in real human historical things - there is no Saint Nicholas of Myra in this Santa, there is no rabbit of the Goddess of Spring in the Easter Bunny, there is no analysis of why Christmas or Easter deserve prominence, because it's not about the religious background.    For some people this will be bad. For others this will be good. Until I knew that this was from a series of stories, I didn't know that it wasn't just a deliberate removal of the religious background from two of these characters, but the focus of the movie was on the extremely engaging character of Jack Frost, voiced by Chris Pine.  So far as I know Jack Frost is not part of the books (yet).    Jack Frost is intangible and inaudible except in the way he exerts his power of cold, because nobody believes in him. He's a \\"bad boy\\" - a very mischievous youth (at 317) who was changed by the Man in the Moon - another character from the original books, who appears in the movie only as the full moon, and never speaks aloud so that we can hear him.    The movie tells three stories.  The first is a story of Jack Frost - the young man whose delight in the fun of living is being eroded by the constant reminder that he is not 'real' to the people around him.  He knows he was made by the Man in the Moon, but doesn't know anything about himself from the moment he awoke underwater in a partially-frozen pond, dragged out of the fear and the dark by the brightness of the moon. His coming into himself is the first story; the second is his becoming, and being accepted, as a Guardian of Childhood, one of the elite mythical beings who inspire the positive feelings of childhood.  The third story is that of 'the boogy man' - Pitch, the Nightmare King, ruler of darkness of fear and doubt and pain who wants to spread them over the world, who has slowly grown stronger since his last defeat. He has returned, and he has everything he needs to overcome the Four Guardians... except for this interloper Jack Frost, who isn't sure he wants the job of Fifth Guardian.    Even if you don't like the secularization - the story is filled with positive, uplifting narrative, with strong moral values.    The packaging is cute, though a bit disposable, and the eggs are amusing.  Now for the less thrilling aspects, the production of the Blu-Ray disk and the content wrapper.  You may skip this if you don't enjoy rants, because I do rant a bit there at the end.    There were two \\"interactive games\\" and a number of language subtitle options, including director's information, which I will be exploring later.  For now, though?  The movie was good, and all I needed was to make popcorn to make it as enjoyable as the movie theatre experience.  Playback was not as simple as it should have been.    Fortunately, I watch blu-ray movies using a blu-ray drive on my personal computer.    As happens with many Blu-Ray products, I once again had to upgrade my commercial Blu-Ray software because in the never-ending paranoid attempt to explain to us how we're all thieves, the movie industry has made it yet again a format incompatible with my previous software.  At this point, I suspect that any Blu-Ray player I would have purchased before last year would be worthless to play this movie.  Further, they hammer the viewer with several mandatory warnings, threats, and bluster-fests wherein they explain that the world is ending because people don't respect copyright.  It must be fun living in a world where everyone caters to your whims and terribly upsetting when they stop putting up with you (and I'm talking to the Studio people here) but in the real world, people don't respect people who start out by showing their own disrespect in the first place.    Make stuff available that people want and they will pay well to see it. Make crap and people will probably pay what it's worth.  Make good stuff unavailable, and people will find a way to get it.  That's been true for as long as recorded civilization.    The FBI warning? Unnecessary, reading it doesn't make me do anything but resent you.  The bit at the end with the earnest message of  \\"how you can go educate yourself (because you're obviously an ignorant pirate) about how PIRACY has been destroying our ECONOMY\\" ... uhm, yah, no.  What's been destroying our economy is a combination of things involving greed and overreaching, but one big part of it has been fraudulent acts on the part of banks that grossly inflated then collapsed a major part of our economy to below the point before the inflation was started.  That's an entirely different kind of piracy.    But I promise that I won't take the DVD and Blu-Ray disks that I just PURCHASED for MONEY and make copies of them for everyone else, if you promise to start looking at realistic ways to make piracy not worth it, by making it easier to get your stuff and by making it easy for people to pay you what they feel it's worth - and that's usually more than you'd get otherwise if it's any good.    One Hint: Continually changing formats, messing up things with DRM, and generally insulting your customers?  That won't do it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OK, this book was great, but I bogged down in the 2nd and will need to go back and pick it up again. Maybe I shouldn't have seen the movie ? Maybe I have that &#34;little attention span&#34; problem.....Woe is me!
1476734941|5.0|Very interesting. Quick reading and easy to understand. Simple plan, now we will see the results. Read it in one sitting.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Go ahead - list your top five &#34;Best Mob Movies&#34; and most will contain Godfather 1 & 2, Goodfellas, Casino and Scarface. But, where the heck is this Best Picture winner? The Departed&#34; finally won Martin Scorsese his Best Director Oscar, despite the fact that he should have won for Goodfellas, Raging Bull and probably Taxi Driver. Let's face it, the man is a genius - a national treasure. Since The Departed, he broke new ground with Hugo but was beaten out by the director of a silent film.<br /><br />The story is tight, the interaction between  the cast is absolutely stellar: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Vera Farmiga, Anthony Anderson and Alec Baldwin make this one of Scorsese's best. Better than Casino, better than Scarface.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Just as there is something appealing about watching the changing patterns of light and color on a wall of drying paint, there is something appealing about this app. I doubt you could persuade me to pay for it, but as FAOTD it was a bargain. One of my granddaughters found it interesting and we talked a little physics and biology, the others will get to try it this weekend. I do find it more relaxing than the games I usually play where I compete against the chance of the machine or the countdown of a clock. It is certainly more interesting than much of what is on TV these days.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Quentin Tarantino continues to be brilliant. Never more so than casting the incredible Christoph Waltz in the role of his career as the &#34;Jew Hunter&#34;. The opening scene of the movie is as captivating as anything I can remember. For his efforts, Waltz earned his first Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor). Despite his brilliance, the movie was not completely carried by Waltz. Brad Pitt's performance as Lt. Aldo Raine (aka Aldo the Apache). His opening speech with a mountain accent is so classic that I cold watch it over and over (in fact, I have!!!! &#34;we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only... killin' Nazis.&#34; (Nazi's is pronounced 'Gnat-sees').  Read some more. How can you not be captivated &#34;Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die. Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't not be able to help themselves but to imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us they are tortured with. Sound good?&#34;

0385344228|5.0|In the reviews I read it sounded like a fairly common legal thriller plot.  but I found that it was more nuanced and complex than many...right up there with the really good ones.  The characters are layered, no one more than Jacob; and because the narrator is his father, Andy, we are privy to his inner struggles with the case.<br /><br />Because I knew there were twists and turns and surprises I spent some time thinking about what they might be.  This distracted me to an extent while I was reading, and that was unfortunate, but not the fault of Landay, the author.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is the best. I look forward to it every week and I buy most of the time on mondays just so I don't have to sit the through the commercials.

0634022296|5.0|I've got a lot of Beatles songbooks, and this is by far my favorite. And the chord diagrams show the chords as they're actually played on the record, as opposed to doing silly things like calling a standard D chord raised a half step an Eb (technically correct, but no one ever plays an Eb like that). The real test for me with Beatles books is Norwegian Wood: do they show the tonic as E played like a regular E, or do they correctly show it as a D capo'd to the second fret? If its not the later, the chord diagrams will be useless in the book. This one gets it right.<br /><br />Another good contender is The Beatles - Complete Scores, but the writing is so small, and since it shows so much info on each page, most songs span at least 10 pages. So I use that book for cross referencing and seeing solos or melody lines if I need it, and this for general song outlines.

B005LAIHGI|3.0|I was reluctant at first, but rented it free at the library so why not. Started out a little slow, average offensive humor, expected a little more from Sacha, but gradually got better. It went from hot to cold quite a bit. Masturbation scene was interesting along with the democracy rant at the end. I'll have to watch it a few more times to get all the jokes. It's worth a viewing if you're a Sacha fan, but this isn't Da Ali G show if that's what you're expecting.<br /><br />MoPop
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|After watching Castle on TV, I wanted to read the books he writes on the show. I was not disapointed. The characters are close to the characters on TV. A little more in the book than can be shown on prime time TV.

B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I saw this game a few months ago while browsing for a new game.<br />I just couldn't see spending money on a game I knew nothing about.<br />In hind sight, I have missed out on playing this game for over 3 months.<br />Then it (this game), showed up as a FAOTD and I snagged it first thing this morning. I probably should have waited, because I started playing and ended up late for work.<br />For me, this is one of the 5 best FAOTD I have seen over the last 12 months.

0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book and loves to read along - even though she can't read.  It's easy to remember after just reading it a few times and whenever she goes Tinkle or Toot we go through the 'I did it!' and 'Hooray!' from the book.  Pretty cute. :)
B00005JPD0|5.0|Great time Travel Movie<br /><br />I don't like Denzel, he invokes demons into himself before he does a movie<br />to play the part, he stated that on Oprah.<br /><br />But movie was good.

1250012570|5.0|How does one write a review for an absolutely perfect book? All of the beautiful words I need to write this review cannot be found within me because they are all within the pages of this book. Rainbow Rowell has taken all of the beautiful words and used them in this story - and I am not complaining.<br /><br />I have been captivated by this book. I see kids playing outside on my drive home from work. I think of this story. I hear a certain kind of song. I think of this story. I remember my neighbor at my old apartment. (Dang, he actually reminds me of the character, Richie). I think of this story.<br /><br />My heart sings for Eleanor and Park. I have been waiting for a book like this for so long. I have been waiting to FEEL what this book made me feel. I have been waiting for something to make my heart ache in all the right ways.<br /><br />I didn't find my first love on a school bus - but I did find my best friend there. Because in my mind I am the president of the Eleanor and Park fan club (ha ha), owning the Kindle version wasn't enough. I have since purchased the hard copy. I also bought the hard copy for that best friend I met on the school bus all those years ago.<br /><br />How could I not share a book that has poured so much good into my heart?
1451695195|2.0|This was a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There are too many good Heaven books out there . This was too technical for me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good quick read.  A good book to read while relaxing at night (a nonthinking book).  Liked the ending of the book
1451613512|5.0|This is a great eye opener, it's hard to understand how there is so much evil and wrong doing in the world and how the big corporations run the show, greedy people.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't think think I would e entire like this book because I figured it would be the same as every other love story but this book wasn't a typical romance story. It was phenomenal and I could not put it down I am glad I gave it a chance.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I have been on a dry run with books of late. My kindle app seems to think I want to read fantasy romance novels (I think from that one time I tried and failed to read Twilight because someone told me the book was better. It's not.). So my enthusiasm for this book may be a little distorted. But here are my two cents:<br /><br />On the first page I was relieved to find sentences that seemed to be formed by someone out of their teens and this intrigued me. Reading further I found a well thought out premise. 'Now this is getting exciting!' I thought. Next thing I know, it seems to be well paced. I'm starting to get wary. Where's the catch here?<br /><br />Well there isn't one. This is a great book. If you're into dystopian futures, sci fi or mysteries you'll probably thoroughly enjoy this. And if you're not, you'll probably still enjoy it (unless you like fantasy romance novels. In which case, I hope you're a 14 year old girl and I hate you for funding that drivel).<br /><br />When I finished reading this I thought, 'This would make an excellent movie. And it should be directed by Ridley Scott.' Thank you film gods! Well it will be produced by Ridley Scott but close enough!
B005UD1D62|5.0|From LA Candy to The Fame Game. You can really see how Lauren 's writing has matured on this second series. It's great to see someone grow. The book as always is one that I love. Off to the next one!
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|So this was enjoyable. I enjoyed the concept, even if I found it a little shaky. I liked the character and the set up. Who doesn't like a good gaol break story? But the ending was disappointing. I like short stories but they're very hard to write because the ending needs to be really punchy. This one just felt unfinished, like there was an epilogue that revealed the twist that was just left off. I am kind of glad I bought it because the concept was great but if I can get this and Anthony Ryan's amazing novel 'Blood Song' for the same price, I feel like I'm getting ripped off.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This a  book that is pretty good but kind of predictable.  Liked how it was written and enjoyed the characters
B0070NSPCU|5.0|The name of this book is so utterly cliched I'll admit I was a little nervous when I picked it up. This book does not live up to it's name. It is not cliched at all. In fact, it's one of the best books I have ever read. Read it. Everyone read it. It's only $4.99. So read it.
B008XNZMOU|2.0|First, let me say that I am outside the target demographic for her albums, although I have been an admirer of hers for quite a while. Anyhow, I am old enough to remember a time when music supported singer's vocals. You could clearly understand the words of the song and didn't need to have them printed on some pamphlet. Nowadays, however, it seems that vocals only serve to enhance the background music. This is especially true for Red. Swift generally begins each song with a sound that resembles country music, but quickly escalates the volume to the point that the background music and the heavy beat of the drums drowns out her voice. Which may not be a bad thing because, true be told, her voice is rather thin. Nothing on this album is memorable; not one song has stuck in my head as have some of her earlier songs.<br /><br />Another thing, her \\"kiss and tell\\" songs were fine when she was a teenager experiencing all the angst of the teen years. But she's an adult now and her bleating about her past romances is beginning to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />In any event, I do not see how Taylor Swift can continue to be called a \\"country\\" singer. She is 90% pop and only 10% country. It seems that anyone can be called a country singer these days if you have even a hint of a country accent. But, hey, that seems to be what the target demographic wants. Problem is, the music does not showcase the singer.
B000TEMROY|5.0|Time and again I come back to this excellent album.  It's truly timeless and I never tire of listening to it.  It's simply superb.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thius is a fabulous mini series.  The acting is sensational - I love the British/American characters and the interplay between them.  The time the show is set in is so interesting and I love all the characters.  I just wish Downton Abbey 4 was coming sooner.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is by far the greatest Bond film since the early days of 'Goldfinger'! Whereas James Bond was always a bit campy, Craig's Bond is an edgy and intense character. No pretty boy here, this Bond is the real deal.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|The kind of book that stays with you when you put it down...it's like apple pie in the window of a familiar, and yet terrifying house....

B005HSL626|3.0|This version only lets you play for a certain amout of time then makes you stop.  It does let you play without the bombs for as long as you want but I expected more.
B004FQX59I|5.0|I heard that this movie has some inkling of truth to it and I think rather enlightening as to the timeline when all these things happened.  Enjoyable well done movie and nice to have in your library.  I could watch it several times and get more out of it each time.  Unfortunately they could not put everything that happened in there but it covers the basic premise.

B001UTW7QU|4.0|Good Sci-Fi.  The characters develop well and it's easy to have a favorite.  The show builds on past episodes so you don't want to miss an episode.
0553386697|5.0|I believe the world would be a better place  if all parents, teachers, and anyone who plays a role in raising children read it and implemented the authors recommendations.  The authors use neuroscience findings to guide adults so that they can help children gain control over their emotions, release negativity, and make better decisions.  Key concepts include the difference between &#34;upstaris&#34; (higher brain) and &#34;downstairs&#34; (primitive brain) tantrums, and how to respond when a child &#34;flips her lid&#34;, essentially losing her ability to use her frontal cortex to temper her emotions.There are applications for all age groups, and even a quick guide by age at the end of the book. This book receives my highest recommendation.
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|This album has so many wonderful Rock classics.  My favorite is Follow You, Follow Me, but there are many more.  The lyrics are great and the music itself catches you and takes hold.  Great album.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on television. I actually started reading the comics in between seasons to tide me over. The show is suspenseful, the characters are well written and acted, and the show is enjoyable even if you aren't into zombies. I highly recommend The Walking Dead.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Classic game for the family. Fun to see how far you need to shoot the birds. Happy that Kindle offers this app for free.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Sick of the constant idiotic comments from whiners still living off their parents into their 30's and 40's, those are the ones stamping their wickle footsies. Thought they were gone after the Trilogy. No, they are back, lonely as ever. Brats are complaining about not being offered something that doesn't even exist yet! They are splitting up a one film book into 3 movies!...and they still whine!<br /><br />What is wrong with wanting the same version you saw (and enjoyed!) at the movie theater and the movie studio supplying that demand?<br /><br />Being forced to buy against your will? No! Product being misrepresented/false advertising (are they pretending its extended and giving you theatrical?) No! They are merely OFFERING (no obligation!) for sale the same cut as people saw in the movie theatre! Wow...those b*stards! You mean whats for sale is the same movie that was for sale in the cinema a few months ago that we paid to see? OMG we are being ripped off!..who on Earth would pay to see the movie and then...heavens..want to own the same version at home?<br /><br />Well, some film fans do prefer theatrical cuts. Yep, they do...er...yes they do. Freedom of choice and opinion, is that ok?, especially on a film that was stretched way more than it could have been from a book way smaller than the LOTR.<br />The ironic thing is that some of these clowns are the same brats whining about the Trilogy editions not being extended immediately, and are now going on about this movie being too long...and yet...they want an extended edition of said \\"too long,slow paced\\" movie!<br /><br />Can you really please all the people all the time? Well, they try don't they,after all its more profitable to sell to as many customers as possible, with both versions! They would be dumb to sell both at same time.<br /><br />The real problem?...endemic of this once great country...the culture of  \\"I want it this way and I want it now\\" and I'll throw a hissy fit if I don't get it. Yes I will...I'll scream and scream and scream like a baby. Spoiled brats plain and simple.<br /><br />It's called patience, learn some, its useful. If you had some you wouldn't be throwing your pacifier out of the stroller right now. It'll still be the extended version whenever its released...you just can't have it now! Had your Parents done the right thing by you, you'd be ok with this. The wait for something desirable makes obtaining it, at last, more satisfying.<br /><br />Ok, Mommy let you down, so heres what she should have taught you. Seriously...YOU can't have it now...deal with it...whine and whine...you 'ain't getting it until those \\"evil haha:-)\\" studio bosses say you can...suck it up spoiled brats..this is another thing you are not getting your way on...your too small to boss them around...they do not care what you think, its THEIR business NOT yours.<br /><br />They obviously did very well out of this strategy for the LOTR Trilogy, which is why they are sticking to it! IT MAKES MONEY! Thats the aim ya' know. Why earn millions less (that can go into making more great films!) to satisfy a very vocal but relatively small group of whingers? It's not called the movie \\"business\\" for no reason!<br /><br />A relatively small book is being milked and padded into 3 movies to make 3 times as much money than one would, because you people will buy it of your own free will...and you want extended editions of something thats been stretched way more than it maybe should!?!<br /><br />You know if they had released the extended first, you'd only moan it was rushed and not finished properly and theres some 'green tint fog' malarky going on.<br /><br />Unless they are advertising \\"extended edition\\" (they 'aint!) and you were lied to for your money, then it is NOT  a rip-off. They are selling exactly what they are describing.<br /><br />So in short children...Eat it! (not the cake though, you can't have that yet) :-)scream and scream and scream like a baby.

B0041D843M|5.0|Well written and understandable information. Unfortunately, until we change academics in this country I think too few people will benefit for the knowledge contained here. It is much easier for the masses to bemoan their fates and continue to eat what 'tastes good' to them, and believe in whatever pill their physician prescribes to ease the pain of over indulgence and ignorance. Bravo to Dr. Campbell for having the courage and conviction to shine some truth upon the scandalous food and healthcare system in this country.

B00AYR2FOI|3.0|Finding it hard to write a good review having slammed the disappointing releases by Emmylou/Rodney and Clapton. I've followed Boz since the Steve Miller days. He seems to have taken up the cocktail jazz route with 'Jazz standards' and 'Speak low' and now this. I know there are some classics on here, but I do prefer the meatier numbers, favorites like 'Mixed up, shook up girl', 'Cadillac walk', 'Pearl of the quarter' and 'Dry spell'. Seven of the other tracks share the same dreamy (even dreary) tempo and do we really need another 'Rainy night in Georgia'? (Didn't get beyond 15 seconds of that). Wish he'd get back to the  bluesy 'Come on home' style.

B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|David Bowie makes one of the most anticipated returns of 2013 releasing his first album in just shy of ten years, [[ASIN:B00AYHKIZ6 The Next Day (Deluxe Edition)]], released via Columbia. The Next Day proceeds his previous studio album, September 2003 release [[ASIN:B0000C8AUO Reality]]. Over the course of 14 tracks, mostly written solely by Bowie, the 66-year old rock veteran rarely, if ever, missteps. The Next Day ends up being an enjoyable reminder of Bowie's pivotal role within the music world.<br /><br />Title track \\"The Next Day\\" starts things off strongly with a driving groove, characterized by jagged guitar and pounding drums.  Bowie's vocals are energetic, though later cuts possess more fine tuned vocal production.  The catchy chorus brings things together: \\"Here I am / not quite dying / my body left to rot in a hollow tree / its branches throwing shadows / on the gallows for me / and the next day / and the next / and another day.\\"  \\"Dirty Boys\\" opts for a more relaxed, even more hip groove. The sound is steeped in psychedelic/soulful/ art rock, noted for its gritty, dirty electric guitars and the thoughtful use of saxophone.  \\"Dirty Boys\\" manages space well; there is plenty of space for instruments to play between lyrics/lines.  Bowie vocally delivers the sophomore cut soundly.  The uptempo \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" caps off the first trio of cuts superbly, opting for a driving groove favoring the opener.  The combination of acoustic and electric guitars works well creating a rhythmic wall of sound.  The lyrics continue to allure, with Bowie's chorus highlighting.<br /><br />\\"Love Is Lost\\" continues the utmost consistency, notable for magnificent production and dramatic songwriting.  \\"It's the darkest hour, you're twenty two / the voice of youth, the hour of dread / the darkest hour and your voice is new / love is lost, love is lost,\\" Bowie sings on the verse.  The groove drives, sporting minimalism at its best.  Promo single \\"Where Are We Now\\" is simply beautiful, contrasting everything else as of yet with rock balladry.  The harmonic progression features thoughtful chordal choices while Bowie delivers arguably his most tender vocal of The Next Day.  The chorus is simplistic, but telling: \\"Where are we now, where are we now? The moment you  know, you know, you know.\\"  Pummeling drums add more rhythmic intensity towards the end, punctuating lyrics \\"As long as there's sun...\\"<br /><br />\\"Valentine's Day\\" proceeds, taking a more 'standard' approach compared to other cuts.  Even so, it still possesses the Bowie touch.  \\"If You Can See Me\\" is incredibly animated - his most manic, unique number to an extent.  Instrumental riffs continue to propel, as do unique lyrics: \\"I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God / Swear to destroy the beasts, stamping the ground...\\" \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" is optimistic and anchored down by a gargantuan bass line, a direct product of the 70s.  The chorus is predictably strong (\\"I'd rather be high / I'd rather be flying / I'd rather be dead / or out of my head...\\"), aided by the use of harmonized backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"Boss of Me\\", co-written with Gerry Leonard, has a dark air about it as Bowie sings \\"...Who'd have ever dreamed / that a small town girl like you / would be the boss of me...\\" \\"Dancing Out in Space\\" rolls right along, while \\"How Does the Grass Grow?\\" delivers one of the knockout punches of The Next Day.  \\"How Does the Grass Grow?\\" possesses many classic rock cues, arguably delivering the best production work of the effort. The chorus is both addicting and tongue-in-cheek: \\"Ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya...how does the grass grow / blood, blood, blood...\\"  Clever, clever, clever.<br /><br />\\"You Will Set The World On Fire\\" has a hard act to follow, but continues consistently without conceding momentum.  The 6/8 groove of the penultimate \\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" is a welcome contrast, while the use of strings is a lovely touch.  A unifying refrain doesn't appear till the end (\\"I hope you could feel so lonely / you could die...\\").  Concluding number \\"Heat\\" closes with a mysterious vibe, different from anything else appearing before it.  The key lyric \\"My father ran the prison\\" reappears throughout the course of the cut. (The Deluxe edition features three bonus tracks \\"So She\\", \\"Plan\\", and \\"I'll Take You There\\".)<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00AYHKIZ6 The Next Day (Deluxe Edition)]] is another fine addition to the David Bowie discography.  Not only does Bowie make a return, it is a triumphant one filled with solid songs and solid vocals.  This album probably won't stand the test of time of his classics (most modern albums by veteran artists don't given the loftiness of previous work), but it is nothing short of enjoyable or consistent.  4 stars.pear till the end (\\"I hope you could feel so lonely / you could die...\\").

0062080237|5.0|There is not a lot I can say in this review that won't have been said a hundred times, in a thousand different ways, by previous reviewers. The bottom line however, is that this novel is a truly extraordinary accomplishment. I read it over two evenings, and the time simply flew. Anyone who has rated American Gods at anything less than 4 stars simply hasn't \\"got it,\\" and probably never will. (I'm sure that fact is an ironic truth that of itself vindicates Gaiman's triumph with the subject matter of this novel, and would probably make him smile, were it ever to cross his mind.) So be it. That's evolution for you ... perhaps they'll have better luck in their next lives! In the meantime, those amongst us who appreciate fluid, beautifully constructed prose, wonderful characters, and a rich, impeccably crafted and multi-layered plot ... can revel in the awesome journey this thoughtful and inspiring novel takes us on.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|3.5 out of 5<br /><br />When dying alien and Green Lantern Abin Sur is discovered by brash and cocky fighter pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), Hal's life is suddenly changed when the mysterious alien gives him a green power ring and matching lantern with vague instructions to \\"speak the oath.\\"<br /><br />After finally unlocking the lantern, Hal is taken to the planet Oa where he learns he has become Abin Sur's successor in the Green Lantern Corps and is also the first human to ever bear the powerful mantle of a Green Lantern.<br /><br />As part of his training, Hal is taken under the wing of a powerful Lantern named Sinestro (Mark Strong) whose view of right and wrong is sheer black and white, and who has no trouble enforcing the law with lethal force. Turns out Sinestro wasn't the first to feel this way as long ago one of the creators of the lantern rings--the Guardians of Oa--disagreed with the Oan Council and set off on his own, discovering a new power, this one the yellow power of fear. Now the super powered being Parallax, this former Guardian wishes to take revenge on those who banished him.<br /><br />As Hal learns what it means to set aside his own pride and ego and live by the sacred Green Lantern oath--In brightest day, in blackest night, no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's Light!--he must come to grips with his newfound power and expel Parallax's presence from the universe once and for all.<br /><br />After the crazy success of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Warner Brothers and DC Comics were in big need of another hit after Superman Returns failed to deliver at the box office, and so they went to another DC hero: Green Lantern. Good choice. He's a kind of Superman/Batman hybrid in that Hal Jordan is human and has the qualities and struggles thereof like Bruce Wayne, and yet by wielding his power ring, his superpowers get up there right alongside the Last Son of Krypton in many ways. Whether this was Warners' reasoning or not, I don't know--probably not--but GL was certainly a good character to try and take to the big screen especially since it had never been done before.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the movie wasn't bad. I liked it. It didn't change my life, but it's not the piece of garbage many folks make it out to be. It covered Hal Jordan's transformation into Green Lantern, delivered awesome effects, created a sense of atmosphere both about the Green Lantern Corp and Oa, and came through on telling a simple story that got Hal Jordan from Point A to B in a reasonable amount of time.<br /><br />People complained there wasn't enough action or not enough stuff on Oa--but those kinds of things are--and weren't--supposed to be the focus of this movie. It was about getting the ring into Hal's hands and teaching him the ol' Uncle Ben motto of \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\"<br /><br />I like how it took time to get Hal used to using the ring and it wasn't a case of him putting it on and suddenly becoming an expert on creating green light constructs. And once he figured it out, I enjoyed how his constructs were simple--the racetrack, machine guns, etc.--as opposed to something crazy or way too technical. Why? Put yourself in his shoes. You'd probably construct something you're more comfortable with than trying to create some big complicated airship stocked with robot soldiers with a zillion weapons and stuff.<br /><br />The love story between Hal and Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) seemed forced though it did provide a nice bridge between the realm of Oa and Earth. Clearly this relationship was introduced for sequel purposes because those who know the comics know Carol Ferris becomes the supervillain Star Sapphire down the line.<br /><br />I think in the end, Green Lantern did its job. Could it have been better? Sure. Could it have been worse? Yup.<br /><br />Regardless, I like popping this movie into the player from time to time, and if you'rea superhero fan, you should, too.a superhero fan, you should, too.
B00846WWVM|4.0|This is a nice game that progressively does get challenging. First thing I noticed was the sound of the game, which I liked. The graphics are beautiful as well. Although this isn't a strategy-type game, this game does have a unique concept that keeps your intrigue throughout. It is actually a really run game; however, there are plenty of times that you have to have the exact perfect angle to reach an area. The controls got me a little frustrated at times, so if Mediocre can work on perfecting that, it would make the game that much better.
B00821OX98|3.0|It's an original concept with a good cast.  The plot holes are a little annoying.  It's worth watching if you have the time.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is the best kindle game invented!!!!!! it requires so much skill and the possibilities are endless! when you buy a character you feel like you accomplished something. You also only use the coins you earn in the game to buy the items!!! so awesome! I am addicted to Subway Surfers!!!
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I saw the four Ring Cycle operas on the Met's Live in HD broadcasts and really loved them.  Also saw Wagner's Dream on PBS.  I was really excited when the boxed set of the five shows came out.  It's a pricey set, though, so I promised myself that I'd treat myself when I got my tax refund.  That's what I did and I'm thrilled to be able to own this set.

B0044JVM00|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums since I was about 12 and I am now 44. It still sounds as fresh and new as it did when I first heard it. Parsons clearly learned some very valuable lessons while engineering for Pink Floyd and built on them in an exceptional manner. There is no other music like the kind that Alan Parsons has created over the years. Creativity like this no longer exists and that is a shame.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created an amazing work of words with this book. I love the fantasy genre and have read Hobb, Feist, Martin, Sullivan, Sanderson, Weeks, Brooks, Gemmell, you name it. I enjoyed reading every single page more so than any other book I've read. I really love the authors I mentioned and have read almost all of their books, but for numerous reasons, Rothfuss stands out. He writes like a storyteller and I often found myself rereading lines or reading them aloud because of how well written they were. Yes, the characters have flaws (like they should) and Kvothe's main flaw is arrogance, but you're still able to relate to each character. I had to take a couple weeks break from reading after finishing the books (I read both back to back) and even then the next two books I read were kind of ruined because they were compared to Rothfuss. Give it a try and I bet you'll be hooked by page 20. What's the worse thing that could happen? You return the book or you love it so much that it ruins the next book you read.

B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|It was just ok. Cheap laughs but easy to guess the story line. To quick dialog for my younger ones and not enough depth for my older ones. It was ok to rent but won't be buying this one.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game to play if you love horses, lots of different ones to have and take care of. Worth it!
B003FBMS4W|5.0|The Searchers cast John Wayne in a role that was a bit different from many of his other roles on film, but it resulted in a superb film that has become the all time great Western movie. This film was made in the era when political correctness was not recasting history into something that never existed.<br /><br />A lone rider approaches a remote homestead in the American Southwest in 1868 where the only true love of Ethan still lived with his brother and his family scratching a living from the cruel desert raising cattle. Ethan quickly reveals himself to be a bitter, hard man from his Civil War service as a Confederate soldier. He also reveals himself to be highly prejudiced against Indians, but his prejudice is borne from sad experience as he reveals his knowledge of Indian culture and especially murder raids.<br /><br />When his brother and his family are massacered by raiding Indians, it was discovered his two neices were kidnapped by the Indians. An enraged Ethan sets out to trail the Indians and make sure his nieces were not allowed to become part of the tribe life. Ethan grudgingly lets a young man played by Jeffrey Hunter who raised by his brother's family and was with Ethan investigating an Indian raid to accompany him on his quest for vengeance.<br /><br />Thus began a tale of trailing the Indians who had his niece over a period of several years with Ethan being obsessed with finding and killing his niece rather than letting her be raised as an indian. The Searchers was most appropriate as a title for the move.<br /><br />There are many tense moments as well as humorous times as the tale unfolds and the wanderings of the two men is narrated by Jeffrey Hunter. Ultimately, the two men catch up with the tribe and the planned retribution is at hand. Can Ethan really kill his niece?<br /><br />The end scene to this movie has been called one of the very best in all of movie making.<br /><br />I have watched this film so many times I can't count them. Anyone who has not seen this movie yet will have missed an incredibly exciting and well made story. This is film making like it should be.<br /><br />The best part is that there is no foul language of any kind during the entire film.
B006YC74E8|5.0|For photo editing on a phone this app is more than enough. Worth a look for sure and won't disappoint.

B001JIFYSA|3.0|Some beautiful scenes, interesting story lines (emphasis on the plural of storylines), but lacks a coherent, unified narrative -- even though one is attempted at the end. I will always remember some scenes from the movie (who can forget Hugh Grant dancing to a Pointer Sisters song?), and I found myself chuckling at some of the humor, but what this movie really needed was a good script overhaul.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I give this game a five star because its one of the first game i played<br />as a kid in the arcade . Ooops that tells my age. lol...
B00190OHD6|3.0|The premise is unique and interesting, but it lost its charm after the hour and a half mark for me. It has some funny moments, but it is depressing at a lot of levels. The ending also was not-so-inspiring and a little too honest for the genre of... whatever genre this movie was supposed to be.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is the best book ever!the stir y is the best book in the history of books! so much adventures
B0060CXSR4|4.0|Certainly a loose interpretation of history but an entertaining invitation to children to enjoy hostorical stories.  An example of open-mindedness and what we can learn from each other regardless of our backgrounds.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I really like almost the whole album.  Their songs are so richly auditory.  I am going to be listening to this album for a while.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story became interesting early and continued to entertain throughout.  I am planning to start the next book tonight.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing because the story is relatable, the characters are likeable, and the dialogue between them is well crafted and enjoyable. I really had a blast reading this book and couldn't wait to recommend it to my friends and family. You'll love it or I'll refund your money. :)
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|This game is fantastic! I find it incredibly relaxing, I usually end up playing it right before I go to bed. One of the best app of the day I've ever gotten.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great read. Modern love story that kept you wanting more. I could not put this book down. Loved the ending too!
0756405890|5.0|By far this is one of the best books I have read. I have no complaints about this book whatsoever (unlike the sequel).<br />Sometimes a book just has a unique feel to it, such as Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones. This book has a unique feel to it, it is myth and adventure.<br />This is not a fantasy book, it is not limited by the genre. Like Tolkien and Martin, this is literature.<br />Pros<br />Rothfuss is just that good of a writer.<br />This book is really really clean. You could give this book to your grandmother (again unlike the sequel which goes off the rails around chapter 95) That may not mean much for those of us that like Game of Thrones, but I gave this book to my mother, it is literally that clean (although as a warning, I told her not to read the sequel... maybe I will just take some scissors to about 10 or so chapters in Wise Men Fear).<br />Even when the plot is not moving, the writing is so good that it is still enjoyable.<br />Again to repeat, great books have a unique feel of wonder to them This is one of those books.<br /><br />I literally have no cons for this book.<br /><br />6 Stars
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie but never saw the tv show. I was able to see all of the episodes for free when I became an Amazon Prime member. Joss Whedon did a great job with a great cast. I recommend this show and now understand why people want to see it come back.
0756407125|4.0|Honestly if a less talented author had a book that had as little plot, I would probably 1 star it.<br /><br />Pros<br />Again, Rothfuss is a great author, his wording, pace and characterization keep you fully entertained.<br />The Scenes in the Inn with older Kvothe are as good as anything in the first book.<br />The \\"Short Stories\\" that make up Wise Men Fear are for the most part excellent.<br />It is better than rereading Name the Wind.<br /><br />Cons<br />It is not all that much better than rereading Name the Wind.<br />The plot goes nowhere, this is really a collection of short stories (Filler) that have no connection to the main plot.<br />The \\"martial arts\\" \\"tribe\\" is almost laughable in that is is just bad.<br />This book is clean for 95 chapters and then gets filthy (not by Game of Thrones standards) for the rest of the book. Sex works for Game of Thrones, it helps enhance the world, the characters motivations, and their ability to manipulate and use power.<br />In Wise Men Fear, it really does nothing, it is about as jarring as reading The Once and Future King and finding that King Arthur starts sleeping with every other woman in the kingdom in detail. (Notice that The Once and Future King has marraiges, affairs and murders, but those acts are dealt with in a consistant way with the rest of the book)<br />But I'm just annoyed because I gave my mother book one (which she loved), and then I had to tell her not to read book 2.<br /><br />Just think of it as a collection of short stories set in Kvothe's life
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to access my favorite website through this convenient and well thought out app. It's easy to use and easy to get addicted to!
055358894X|5.0|I know this sounds cliche, but I could not put this book down.<br />This is a fast paced book with a lot of twists and turns. It really seems to be Oceans 11 set in a fantasy world.<br /><br />Pros<br />Locke is one of the more interesting characters I've ever read about. Too many characters are supposed to be whitty and smart, and come out seeming just fake. For Locke Lamora, it really works.<br />Really fast paced, not a lot of down time after the first chapter.<br />Interesting Venice-like background.<br /><br />Cons<br />This book is so good it makes his next book look bad.<br />There is a little bit of \\"Plot No Jitsu\\" (The most powerful character is the one that the plot can't kill) Sometimes it seems that Locke does not die just because then the book would end.<br /><br />Again this is a very very good book that I highly enjoyed.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Pressfield takes a firm look at writer's resistance--but he's right on the money! Then he inspires all of us to become the best writer that we can be. He's inpirational.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|5 stars because of its pull no punches detail from the Scriptures in the Bible. Also for fully depicting why it is called \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". Recommended for all of us who need to know that Jesus Christ, the son of God, died for our sins though he knew no sin. Trust in Him alone for your salvation!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Great movie. Great love story. What more can I say about this movie? I cry every time I watch it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love conquers life, enjoyment, sadness, and a little bit of everything. After all the challenges, Christian trying to control his anger and Ana. Ana growing to be a good business woman because of her husband, an excellent lover and good mother. Christian maturing an putting his past where it belongs. Always excellent scenes of making love that lives everything to your imagination.<br />Looking at the changes of the two of them and growing like a real couple with real problems, with money or not. And most of all how with time  loves changes, grows stronger and stronger, is wounderfull.<br />From the 3 books this is the one I enjoy the most, and by the way I'm reading it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|App does exactly what it claims. I have had no problems with it so far. Great way to see what the weather is going to be like in the next few days.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|For the people that I heard that this is a book full of porno, I say please grow up; this is a love story of 2 people that fell hard for each other, with the complications of life, one that has to be in control because of his own pas;  Christian that had a mother that was under drugs and died in his arms; an the other( Anastasia) being very naive, lovable with low esteem because her mother couldn't leave without a man.  The way they met, fell for each other, got engaged too fast and of course lots of kinky sex (why not?) . Even it is been helping (certain ideas) to do it with my husband.  Really I love it, even the fights that is part of real life, if not how boring.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Rented this for my 2 year old son. He has only seen the first Toy Story. But he was hooked on this one. He watched it about 4 times during the 48 hour rental period. Such a great and funny movie.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|Simple absorb everything around you game.  My review is that this might just put me to sleep, it's that boring.
B008NMT684|5.0|My son loves these kind of puzzles. And since it was trucks he liked it even more. He was hooked after the first try.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It is simple game but can be very challenging. The tides can change very quickly so be careful.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son loves these kind of puzzles on the Kindle. And he loved it even more since there were trains and planes. I ended up paying for the full version so my son could do all the puzzles. Perfect for any train/plane loving kid.
B004RL9T50|5.0|My sons kept asking to see it so I ordered it on instant video.  I personally didn't watch the movie, but it kept them quiet so in my book that makes it a hit.  I do love the Amazon Instant Video service better than some of the others though.  It may cost more than Redbox, but it is tons easier and I ended up keeping the movies more days anyway.  Love this service.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Very enjoyable. If you're a Rick Riordan fan, I'm sure you'll like it.  Now I have to read the third book ASAP
B000NYT1M6|5.0|I wish they were making these when I was a kid.  Okay, they are plastic.  But they are high quality and impossible to destroy.  My 2 year old is in love with this bad boy. He pushes it all around the house and opens and closes the hood and dumps the bed.  He fills it with whatever is around - legos especially - and then dumps them out.  The truck is very realistic, but sturdy.  My son is rough with it, and nothing has broken.  The truck is definitely worth the money.  I am now looking to buy more Bruder toys for him for his birthday.  Very cool trucks!
B006J420UE|5.0|Ok so let me tell you right now, i was INCREDIBLY skeptic of the gpu inside the card. But after building my rig, I have 0 regrets on the decision i made. Heres what happened:<br />I received everything but my graphics card and was really eager to get it up and running, so i did lol. I am running a asrock motherboard with 8gb of ram from kingston and a HDD. After getting it all set up and installed, i decided to see what this processor could handle graphically, so i downloaded skyrim, tera online, and League of Legends. The recommended settings for graphics for skyrim was high, tera medium, and LoL was very high. And it did not disappoint. No glitches, no lag, nothing but smooth graphics the entire time. This was even without over clocking it.<br /> For the average person, you could get away with just this and no graphics card. But if you are like me and like to game, you will still need another card. After running tera for 3 hours straight, i had to drop some of the background and the number of toons that would show up, this was with pandora running too due to a slight lag every 5 minutes or so, but after that nothing for the rest of the time i played.<br />truly this out preforms ever expectation i had of it and will ALWAYS be buying a processor with a built in gpu. I Would highly recommend this product to everyone. Even if you drop down and get the 2.6 ghz, it is so worth it.

B008HK3XOU|3.0|This case did exactly what it said it would do.  And not much more.  Which, honestly, isn't exactly surprising.  I got this case because of the sleep wake feature, and because I had a coupon for it.  Although it wasn't in a color I liked, that doesn't really matter on the whole.<br /><br />I was skeptical at first if it was going to even HOLD my Kindle Fire HD because the brackets seemed flimsy and not strong.  However, after snapping it into place and waving it around gently (over a soft bed, of course) I found that yes, indeed they do hold the Kindle.  But I wouldn't recommend waving it around vigorously.  Although I quite expect that it would hold it anyways, the possibility of bending the, or at least creasing the cover itself, is large (in my opinion) and besides, it's just not a good idea to wave technology around.  Expensive technology.<br /><br />The case itself is very nice, smooth and felt good to hold.  It didn't add MUCH weight to the Kindle.  However, the one I received did smell a little bad.  I'm not sure if it's the cover itself (after a through, gentle washing the smell has mostly gone away, unless I put my nose right on the cover) or if it was something in the packaging.  Either way, a gentle, very gentle, wash with either scented water and/or unscented will get the smell to go away.  Dry it immediately, however, so as not to damage it.<br />The sleep/wake feature worked like a charm, which is one of the biggest selling points for me, and there was no problem with the Kindle facing either direction.<br /><br />The standing positions are comfortable, stable, and easy to adjust.  Although there's only so far that you can tilt it before it'll topple/shut, for me it was function enough and I had no problem getting it at just the right angle.<br /><br />My only problem with this case (and the reason it is going to STAY a case and not a permanent over) is how awkward and clunky it felt to hold the Kindle while I was reading with the case on.  Although I used the strap to keep the back cover closed, it still shifted around lightly in my hand and became bothersome.  The whole feel of holding the case as I read was just clunky and I didn't like it.  I ended up just taking the case off while I read, and then placing it back on when I was done.  Not a bad idea, not exactly bothersome, I just wish the whole thing had felt a bit nicer while I held it and read.<br /><br />I would recommend this to people looking for a simple cover to use while traveling or going places with the Kindle, but not as a permanent cover or one to be used to prevent damage.  A decent case, good looking/felling (while not reading) but otherwise nothing special.used the strap to keep the back cover closed, it still shifted around lightly in my hand and became bothersome.

B009IF7092|4.0|Up to the 6th season, Big Bang Theory was serious fun...But with the whole \\"relationship\\" aspect brought to the fore, the edge is diminishing. This used to be four guys, trapped in perpetual adolescence. Suddenly they are all in relationnships. To my mind this has changed the show. It's no longer about them.<br /><br />The last episode I watched (\\"The Closet Reconfiguration\\"), where one character has to come to terms with his absent father, is about as far from the original intent of the show as is possible. I'm not certain whats going on. Was the original demographic for the show not enough to carry it forward? I remain a fan...but it's a different show from where it started. The show is devolving into a typical sitcom.<br /><br />Stephen Hawkings used to show up for a cameo.<br /><br />Now I don't see it happening.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|I was preferring to watch this serie at home than going to cinema... So Greaat!!! Anxious to have the 3rd season!!!
1597801585|5.0|I found the Wind Up Girl one of the most spectacular pieces of Science Fiction to come along in ages.  This book is wonderfully written and has a story that keeps the reader engrossed throughout.  I found this book to be like a James Clavel novel, with the same kind of intense characters and environment.
B008BGNMZU|5.0|I have lots of straight-ahead jazz, lot of jazz-rock fusion, and lots of smooth jazz.  This newest Fourplay album is superb!  This may be their best one yet.  Of course this is an all-star group, but they have outdone themselves this time.  Great tunes, played great...what's not to like?  It sounds nice on a good audio system too.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|great show but its starting to get a little drawn out......still wouldnt miss it though! I'll keep watching until its no longer on!
B00402FGE4|5.0|I think that SGU started out strong as a new series. This is due in part to the wealth of information and characters already available. I like the idea that they took that background, and created a series that was able to write it's own set of rules, based on the situation that the characters find themselves in.<br /><br />The DVD set contains 5 disks. This is all of the first season's episodes, plus some bonus content. The bonus content is primarily Kino footage similar to the documentary that one of the main characters is compiling during several of the episodes. Nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this, and was hooked after the first couple of episodes. Pity that Sci-Fi canceled it after Season 2.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Never in my life did I think I would enjoy a show about zombies, being a 26 year old nurse. Boy, was I WRONG!!<br /><br />I am so glad that I decided to start watching the show. I am addicted!! Season 2 was much better than season 1, so I definitely recommend it to anyone. You sometimes even forget the show is about zombies! It has a great story line and you never know who will get killed off next!<br /><br />My only wish is that I can convince all my friends and family to watch it even though there's scary zombies!
B00957T6X6|5.0|We waited a year for this to come available, love it and highly recommend the series! Already looking forward to the next one...
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is my favorite CD from Bruno Mars. I can't even pick a favorite song because they're all amazing. I really think Bruno Mars is the next Michael Jackson. He has such natural talent. I can't wait to see him live!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My son loves this game.  He's played it non stop for the last couple of days trying to get higher scores.
B000002UCN|2.0|This is not one of his best cd's. Is does have a few good songs that I did not have in my collection which is why I bought it, but I know there is a loe better products on the market
B008VBYN80|2.0|I.m not a Facebooker. This app harasses you to connect with your friends. As another reviewer pointed out the only way to really play this &quot;free&quot; game is to buy power. I also would rather pay up front for a game than have it asking me for money in the game. I deleted this one as I value my privacy and my money.
B001I45UFC|4.0|I've read this book a hundred times. Always a great read and it always brings me back to my childhood. Can't go wrong with the Chronicles of Narnia!
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Great, inspirational movie.  Shows what can happen if you go for what you love to do and work hard at it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book not quite as good as the first one but still a fast read. If you liked the first book of the serious then you should definitely continue and read this one too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was awesomely awesome AND I LIKE HOW THE AUTHOR MADE IT SUPER DUPER AWESOMELY AWESOME WITH A CHERRY ON TOP
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It took me a while to get into this book. You have to pretty committed to get to the end of it. I had to put it down several times and then go back to it several times. It is rather long but that is Stephen King for ya.  I finally did pick the book back up and could not put it down once I got into it. The book carries you back in time to when JFK was president but it's not just about stopping his assassination, it's also a love story.  If you love the King then you will enjoy this book!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|i click it, it downloads then goes back to my main screen. It has never worked for me and i deleted it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book. Will read the other 2. Could not put it down. Read the book first before you watch the movie. The book is a thousand times better then the movie but most books are.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I can't remember when I ever sat through & watched an entire movie since \\"Zorba the Greek;\\" however, I did with this one--and I even took written notes so that I could write this product review! My graduate degree is in the area of psychology and this movie should be \\"required\\" viewing for everyone wanting to gain optimal insight into human relationship response mechanisms,human sexuality,our feelings of insecurity and joy that we all share and so much more.Yes...so much attention is given in this movie's trailers to seeing Helen Hunt naked in bed with an extremely physically disabled man,but if you make the effort to see & think \\"outside of the box\\" while carefully viewing this 1-1/2 hour movie,you will walk away with so much.You will feel/experience the heaviness that the priest,the disabled man's caregivers,his sex surrugate,and so many others experience dealing with their \\"own\\" exposure to sexual issues and just being human as they witness what the polio stricken man (Mark/a.k.a. John Hawkes) is going through as he tackles his own human obstacles.Hawkes (in his character) demonstrates unbelievable strength,emotion,insight, & humor while living what for most people would be a wretched,scary,& depressing existence.Other reviewers of this movie have been critical of so many different minor character roles being introduced;but all of these supportive roles really do \\"ADD(!)\\" to the entire movie.Men are not supposed to cry & nor are we supposed to witness another person's joy and happiness (like what Hawkes experiences) & then weep for that character even more,but this movie will keep your \\"mind\\" glued to the screen--I can assure you.This movie also gives hope to us middle aged people in terms of our sexuality--you see Helen Hunt with some unretouched facial wrinkles and some non-airbrushed body moles,but you also see just how beautiful an older woman can be and you also witness how even this man who has extreme difficulty moving at all can bring out the best in her& make her glow--even when there seems to be a somewhat stale quality between Helen Hunt (the sex surrogate) and her own husband in the movie.Most heterosexual men would buy this movie just to see the beautiful Helen Hunt naked and talking sexy and seductive,but everyone of both sexes will get so much more than that.Yes...it DID win a big award at the Sundance Festival,but let's (you educators,too!) make further \\"use\\" of this movie.It will give us ALL hope and a better understanding of our life's insecurities--in so many dimensions!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Thought the book was  great. Good plot but there were typos which discredited it. I would recommend it to others for a quick read.
B000002MY3|5.0|Great cd, brings me back many years but glad i bought it, its in my car player and my traveling music... shoulda bought it years ago... never to late for a great cd though... and never to old to enjoy it... one of my favs.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|It was a perfect ghost story with twist after twist along the way!  I couldn't put it down!  This is one of those books that I will read again to look at the story through the lens if the ending.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|every song is good.. I'm your man is awesome... and Hallelujah is great... he has a sexy voice.. glad i bought it<br />very romantic .
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has a lot of great features that helps me to keep reading the Bible and focus on it. it also has daily reading plans that help me remember to read it. I highly reccomend it
034580404X|5.0|wish there were more in this series, loved them,, dont' get freaked out by the first book. keep reading.. wish they would make a book about \\"mrs . robinson, past and present,, loved them so ordered sylvia days, crossfire trilogy, supposed to be the next new fifty shades..  fifty shades was the best read i had in years...
B004TI5N38|5.0|Story was engrossing from page 1. Puller is a strong hero and easy to root for. I loved the twists and turns, but not so complicated I couldn't keep up.  This was my first Baldacci read, but I'll definitely be reading more of his books!
B003ODIZL6|3.0|It's an ok dictionary but could be better like adding more words and it could have been a more different book than a normal book
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a movie that every American should watch and injest....it is a part of our history that is just now, coming out of the pages of the CIA....Shows that President Jimmie Carter was more concerned about his fellow man than winning a presidency....
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not bad but too long winded to warrant a better grade.One does get the impression the author left the door open for a rematch with the CIA
145210655X|5.0|Darth Vader and Son is a wonderful and adorable picture book.<br />Jeffrey Brown did a great job doing a show and tell of the \\"what if's\\" between Darth Vader and Luke, there is a real sense of parent-child love in realistic scenarios with the perfect Star Wars twist.<br />Even if the dialog is done to a minimum the messages or little adventures that our character go through are not lost. I feel that it enhances the experience letting the reader add a little of his/her self into the mix.<br />If you are a fan of the Star Wars movies Darth Vader and Son is the perfect choice for you! It doesn't matter if you have or don't have kids, and it is specially recommended for those that would like a tad of cuteness from Star Wars.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|too hard to get the points to play.  too hard to get points and I am on a limited income and can't buy the caash
034580404X|5.0|Got this for my fiancé, she loved them. And therefore, I benefitted from them also :)
0062127241|5.0|This is the second and hopefully last autobiography of a rock star that I read. The first one was Keith Richards'. I should also disclose that I don't like autobiographies or non-fiction in general. My impression is that the blueprint is always the same. The first section is from childhood until the Bill Haley movie (always the big milestone). Then hundreds of pages about band formation, first hits, first girlfriends, drugs, stardom, drugs, getting married, drugs, sex, drugs, auto-destruction, nearly death experience, clean-up, drugs, clean-up, drugs, clean-up and divorce. For closure, new girlfriend and reconstruction.<br /><br />My first impression was to consider Pete's book a conventional autobiography that chronologically tells the story of his life. About halfway through the book, I realized that Pete's writing is way more deeper than my instincts prematurely judged. Pete didn't only talked about his life, he dragged me into his life. All of the sudden, against my wishes, I escorted him, side by side, in his adventures across the world.<br /><br />\\"Who I am\\" is not light. Very often is depressive and dark. Unlike Keith Richards, Pete didn't invest much time talking about his sweet side. Pete is also less subtle. Often because he tries to be honest with himself, he comes through as aggressive, saying things that hurt him, his friends and us.<br /><br />That was not unexpected. I know his songs well enough to have built an image not so far from what Pete portrayed himself. That is the guy from \\"I am the one\\". Self-pity, complexed, depressed,  traumatic, lonely. The despicability and sublimation were a surprise. I don't see him as a Woody Allen as other Amazon reviewers pointed out. Woody Allen at least have some sense of humor. Judging from this book, Pete is uptight.<br /><br />What distinguishes Pete from Jagger/Richards, Lennon/McCartney or even Dylan is that Pete was the only one that was able that consistently write about about himself, his fans and his generation in one song. From \\"I Can't Explain\\" and \\"My Generation\\", through Tommy, Lifehouse, Quadrophenia, Empty Glass, Chinese Eyes and maybe today (I stopped to follow him after White City). Always personal and universal.<br /><br />But it is not only Pete, the composer. On stage, The Who was one of the most exciting bands to see. There was that sense that the four of them were giving their last drop of blood for the concert. The fans sensed truthfulness, you see the band for what they were. What is also interesting is that each member of the band represented its own persona, but you had the four personas in Pete.<br /><br />There are some interesting passages. Keith Moon death, for example. He put aside only 2 or 3 pages for that (very depressing pages by the way), but he built the momentum for that climax. We knew it was coming and eventually it came. I found absolutely brilliant  the way he described how he was informed of Keith death.<br /><br />This  is a story of a very compelling man that couldn't explain his love, was so frustrated by life that wanted to die before getting old, moved out from home, but had the washing done by his mom, looked for a big spiritual force, made millions, constantly looked for love, lost millions, looked for death, looked for life again, always giving blood. In the end, we don't want to be in the shoes of our old idols.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I really love watching.  I know the critics have been a bit nasty, but I typically love what they are complaining about. I hope this lasts a long, long time!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a keeper and is tougher than some... bought the version 2 after going through the free one.. keeps you on your toes
B00009R86L|3.0|Nicely made pad but because of it's &#34;fixed&#34; design, it is not very versatile especially for travel.  The white color is also out of place.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|It's quick, quiet, and has an awesome warranty. I've had many bad experiences with other brands... so far this is golden!
0689105657|5.0|I love this story!  It juxtaposes two civilizations with two world views, tells a facinating story based on historical events, and is so well written that even after hundreds of pages I was eager to read more.  I wish Clavell had written a sequel!  If you like daring action, political and military suspense, and a little love interest on the side, READ this book!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love it just got it works great. A very fun game.Very adventores too!I would recommend this. game for 7-13 year old kids. LOVE IT!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very very good probley<br /> better than temple run I like it when you collect the easter eggs
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I finished this book in one day. He has done it again. I have never been so wowed by a book in a long time. I recommend this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book<br />It's amazing<br />Very interesting. Highly recommended<br />Read read read over over over yeah...<br />Love love lovr
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This movie was light, uncomplicated and humerous! It was very entertaining and exactly what you want for a feel good romantic comedy!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app is SO soothing when I can't sleep. I will save it forever!  I highly recommend this app to anyone else who has sleeping problems, too.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Good movie if you can excuse the story rehash . Graphically this is one of the best films out there. James Cameron's use of CGI to suspend disbelief is amazing he is the king when it comes to creating a believable world. In 3d it's excellent!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The gems are hard to get, but the rest of it is fun training, grooming, and having your horse compete in races.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought the style of writing was very interesting once I got used to it.  I  garden so learning the language was very interesting.<br />The book moved quickly and smoothly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My Horse is very interesting and unlike any app I've come across. The creators have put a lot of effort into making the game as life-like as possible. Considering the knowledge and creativity that was obviously put into this game, I'm amazed that I don't need to pay to play. So enjoyable, I just might look into a career as a horse trainer!
B006FLGBGA|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE, I THOUGHT I WOULD NOT, BUT I HAVE WATCHED IT THREE TIMES SO FAR.  YOU REALLY FALL IN LOVE WITH THE APES AND THEY SEEM SO HUMAN.  GOOD STORY LINE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I delete a lot of games because they are  really bad. I just my kindle for Christmas and this was the second game I got and I haven't deleted it once.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|got this for an elderly cousin who lives on a ranch and rides around on his lawnmower. great idea. thanks
1592400876|5.0|Met the author. She has a great sense of humor and the inappropriate use of words. Highly recommend for grammar nazis
B0095P33IW|3.0|We were pleasantly surprised by this plot, and although a bit corny, we found it rather entertaining.  Recommend it for family viewing.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This movie is amazing. The writing is great, and will have you laughing the entire time. Emma Stone is fantastic!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Having seen many previous 007 films, we expected a more colorful and fun plot.  Instead this was very somber with devious undertones, not at all the usual daredevil atmosphere we had been used to in the past.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The only real complaint I have is the voice acting can at times sound like an old speak and spell.  Other than that this is a great game that takes a good amount of time to play out.  If you like survival horror and or lovecraftian stories, this is perfect.
B004FHP9KA|2.0|Ridiculous and hard to follow plot.  If it were not for the special effects, it would be a total lost cause.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Skyfall lives up to the 50th Anniversary Bond hype. I bought this movie for my new Kindle Fire HD and the picture quality and sound do not suffer one bit in this medium. It carries the same &#34;punch&#34; and dynamic cinematography I experienced in the theater just on a smaller scale. I was concerned about the scale but as I stated before I was more than surprised by the results -- in this case I guess size doesn't matter. It can take a while to download if you opt for the highest quality. I went with the lowest and can't imagine it getting any better. Certainly not enough to justify an hour of DL time.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Wow - this exceeded my expectations even after reading the other positive reviews. Quality of picture and sound is excellent. The Eagles bring back so many memories for us from the 70's timeframe. I like how the editing was done to show just enough shots of the audience but not too much. The closeups of the band members are so clear. Sound is mixed great. I highly recommend this blu-ray.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|The concept, production design, and quality of writing and musical talent during the first season of Smash was wonderful. I read several reviews of the show that complained of &#34;uneven-ness&#34; and a lack of consistency throughout the episodes -- but as an old theater rat and choreographer I didn't notice -- I thought it was great. The caliber of musical composition, orchestration, and execution was superb. I think I have most of the songs on my iPhone and listen to them at least once a week.<br /><br />The central theme of this show and its very impressive cast is to bring the story of Marilyn Monroe to Broadway -- as a musical. The dichotomies present in Monroe's life and subsequent death, her marriages, heartbreaks, liaisons, and substance abuse present a huge challenge to the endeavor. Throughout development, the cast and artistic team face one crisis after another as they all move toward a trial run in Boston. Compound this with a good-old cat fight between two young, driven actresses vying for the role of Marilyn and this show was definitely worth a weekly watch. Sadly, the second season, which has only begun, reflects major changes in the production of this series during hiatus.The changes are not for the better and truthfully, I don't expect Smash to make it. That said, I can already say --- I have only downloaded one song from Season 2 and I will not be purchasing it on DVD. This week NBC announced the show was moving to Saturday night. I think that about sums it up.
B00AK0X5VQ|4.0|Beautiful soundtrack with a lush environment. Definitely worth getting for kindle fire. The controls are simple and easy to learn.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very fun but sometimes it gets glithy and I cant move my guy and then I die but other than that its fun
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have installed this on every android device I have owned. Best keyboard app out there.  I would recommend to anyone looking to replace the default keyboard with an app that offers lots of personalization options.
B004X8W4A4|4.0|I have enjoyed reading this book along with the other books written by this author.  I also enjoy the tv show.  The actors names in the book and the show get a little confusing going back and forth however I enjoy them both!
1616550414|5.0|A must have for any Zelda fan.  This book is a great collection of art from all different Zelda games along with production notes and other fun tidbits.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|its way to hard for me to figure out. i just wanted a game that had less ways to die. and more ways to grow and thrive.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I started the series after I received &#34;Jack Reacher Rules&#34; for Christmas.  I have since been on a journey to read all of the Reacher books.  The action, the thoughtfulness of plot planning, surprise twists and constant action keeps me turning pages!  I love these books, and I have recommended them to friends.
1401233791|5.0|My boyfriend is a true Batman enthusiast (my parents call him Batman and when we receive cards from friends they are usually made out to \\"Emma & Batman.\\" He was very enthralled with the latest Batman installment with Bruce Nolan, but was disappointed at how it failed to follow the canon. In light of that, I thought this would be a great gift and addition to his collection of paraphenalia. He was thrilled to receive it and very satisfied with the art and quality. I know we'll be looking into investing in the next two volumes in the near future!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would recommended this show to anyone who like historical dramas. Acting is superb, great story line. It is actually very educational for those people who hated history in school and for women that don't realize just how far they have really come in todays world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book left me sobbing and balling my eyes out. It is pure magic. When I grow up, I want to be just like Hazel Grace.
1451675046|4.0|very insightful! explaining the dichotomy of myth and Science. Mr. Dawkins way with words is astounding. making the layman a true believer in Science.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I made it very very very far it is very  very very very very very awesome
0062127241|4.0|very revealing! the inner storms  that make man what he is often a rough and happiness rolled into one, a excellent read.
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|You get what you pay for when it comes to cables, dongles and adapters. Apple's are a little more expensive but when you figure in the modest Amazon discount, free shipping, and the fact that you're guarnteed compatibility and quality, it's a no-brainer.<br /><br />This worked immediately with my wife's 2007 Macbook laptop and my older 20\\" Apple Cinema Display. No issues (as on a PC) with drivers or trial-and-error, trying to figure out the exact order of operations. \\"Do I have to plug the adapter in first, then boot, then power up the screen or....?\\" As with all modern Apple products, \\"it just works\\". And the quality of the parts are better than what you get from the \\"bargain cable companies\\". It will last forever if you take care of it.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I love this movie. it's dark but the music is lovely. I first saw this film in Germany. Johnny acting is really good.
B0043D2FB2|5.0|As the oldest surviving written record of Buddhism, the Pali Canon deserves the attention of anyone interested in the subject. Bhikkhu Bodhi's extensive introductions provide useful context, although they may be hard for beginners to follow. If you're new to the subject, I'd recommend starting with Glen Wallis's Basic Teachings of the Buddha, then trying this one.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|This movie was horrible.  More than the money, I wish that I could have the time out of my life back.  Poor acting, mediocre plot, no real info about the bad guys (creatures)such as where they were from, why they were pissed, etc.
1616890835|5.0|Made for a really wonderful Christmas gift for my artist boyfriend.  He was thrilled with it and uses it as a reference all the time!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing story #boss #boss #boss #boss #boss #boss #boss #boss boss. I met RJ Palacio at my library today #boss
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a very unique and interesting book.  It is very technical and sometimes a bit too detailed on things, but if you like realistic science fiction (ie there are no little green men), I would definately recommend it.
B007LE2VDM|5.0|So, I have listened to her from the start, but never took the time to purchase the album. I mainly looked her up on youtube or had a channel on Pandora. Buying this was the best decision I ever made. I bought it over a month ago, and it is still the only thing I have been listening to. It is one of those albums I can listen to without skipping anything. I love her voice, and she has something unique. Definitely worth the buy.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|happy to add to our library. awesome movie, .  Great animation, the villian was a tiny bit scary for my 7 year old son.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I bought this on a whim because I was looking for new music, and saw this for $1.99. I was pleasantly surprised. I own her debut and sophomore albums, but lost interest after that. Though, I fell in love with this one. If you're a fan of Swifts then, I highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow I read in 21/2 days. I cried, smiled and really felt like I was right there with them. Loved it, now to see the movie. Very good reaf
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I have been a Gilmore Girls fan for a while, and I saw these on sale for 8 bucks at the time of purchase. I thought I would start collecting them to add to my ever growing DVD shelf.This is by far my favorite season, and if you're fan of Luke and Lorelai, this is the season for you. It kept me laughing, and I really enjoy the dynamic between Lorelai and Rory. I recommend to anyone looking for a nice, quirky family show.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is the best game in the world my kids always play this game when we go on trips. its awesome
B00A83075M|5.0|A video game bad guy becomes dissatisfied with his life and tries to prove that he can be a good guy, too.  His attempts lead him to change the fate of other video games, and eventually could affect the entire video arcade.  The plot is extremely well-written and pulls at the heartstrings more than once, with lots of humor thrown in, too.  The animation is absolutely superb, switching between simulated 8-bit video game graphics to modern 3-D animation styles.  Beautiful scenery, well-drawn (and well-acted!) characters, and plenty of cameo appearances by well-known video game characters to keep you on your toes.  A must-see for both children and adults!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|lots of fun and challenging. Darling graphics and sounds. I can't wait for my grand kids to give it a go.
B009CZTDE8|5.0|I'm still totally bummed that the film for this hasn't been released in the US yet, but I will say this - the soundtrack does not disappoint. It is fantastic. Captures the soul of the Imaginaerum album so well, and promises more with the movie. A must-have for any Nightwish fan, or fan of soundtracks and scores in general.
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|Haven't played it much yet. But the Grand kids should love it. Cute graphics and sound. Once I really learn what I am doing, I can see that it could be quite challenging.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|For many reasons I am in love with Hawaii! This first opus was excellent: good script, good tension, good actors, and the team McGarrett and Williams did work well together. The dialogues were polish and humorous (just enough!)  I remember the old one  I never liked!
B008MEM24S|5.0|At first; I could not get the hang of this game. It was the first one that I had purchased as well as played. It took my 9 year old grandson to show me how to play it and now it's my favorite!
044024630X|5.0|Smart, savvy, mindbending...another solid novel for Child...it's a treat to see his logic outsmarting the bad guys! A must read!
B002ZG99CC|5.0|The background settings are spectacular for this movie and it just seems more authentic.  Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan do an amazing job in this movie!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Several sounds to pick from and you can mix 2 or more to play at same time. I have gone to sleep faster and slept better using this app.

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The Short Story:<br />If you are new to David Bowie's work, this isn't a bad album to start with, but I might begin with some of his work from the 1970's.  If you are an established Bowie fan, this album is a must-listen.  It's some of Bowie's best material in decades.<br /><br />The Longer Story:<br />At the end of Paul Trynka's Bowie biography \\"Starman,\\" he leaves with a speculative note.  David Bowie never said he retired, but after his A Reality Tour, he disappeared from the music scene almost completely.  This was unusual for the singer/songwriter - he would rarely go a few years without releasing an album in his decades-long career. It seemed like Bowie had genuinely retired, and Trynka's biography leaves some hope that one day, Ziggy Stardust himself will awake from his slumber and release an album that would blow everyone away.<br /><br />Then in early 2013, the world received word: David Bowie was not only working on another album after almost a decade of silence, but the album was already finished and coming out in a couple of months.  The album announcement was accompanied with a video for \\"Where Are We Now?\\"  The song is a slow, introspective ballad that creeps along, and it presents a problem: this is not a song for young, up-and-coming Bowie fans, and it doesn't give listeners a good idea of what the album is.  This is a song that reflects on Bowie's life, and this is significant in the eyes of a fan because as a songwriter, Bowie rarely lets his guard down.  Even personal songs like \\"Changes\\" are wrapped in heavy melodies and pop production.  \\"Where Are We Now?\\" hints at an album that finds Bowie in his later years, reflecting back on his career.  At this point, I was expecting THE NEXT DAY to be an album full of songs like \\"Thursday's Child\\" - good, mellow, wise, but missing the spark that his earlier material had.<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Where Are We Now?\\" gives absolutely no indication as to what THE NEXT DAY sounds like.  With its opening track (the title track), the album roars to life with energetic guitar riff not unlike something from Bowie's Berlin triptych.  Most of the music here is mid to up tempo, and a lot of it reminds of stuff that would have been recorded around 1975-1980.  \\"If You Can See Me,\\" \\"Dancing Out in Space,\\" and \\"Dirty Boys\\" sound like they could have come from the same period as well. \\"How Does the Grass Grow?\\" has a choppy rhythm that feels pulled out of the 1980's oeuvre.  There are a handful of songs that sound strange, but only in the sense that they sound unfamiliar.  \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" and \\"Valentine's Day\\" don't have the quirk or glam that has defined most of Bowie's songwriting, but they are great traditional rock songs with strong melodies.  All of this is played with a renewed sense of interest: Bowie didn't make this record because he was fulfilling a contract, and he's not going through the motions.  He doesn't sound bored here - he sounds more excited than he has in a long, long time.<br /><br />The album finds Bowie pushing himself forward into new territory but with an eye on the past.  Many of these songs do sound new and fresh, but I wouldn't be surprised if some of these were actually written in Bowie's days in Berlin.  The album art encapsulates this: it's the cover of HEROES, but with a giant white square obscuring his face.  Even though Bowie might have (in his work in the 2000's) tried to avoid reaching into his past, he's realized he can't.  Instead of running from his past, and instead of embracing it, he does something different.  He accepts the past and tries to one-up himself.  There's an acceptance from Bowie that we've seen from him in more of the recent albums, but nothing this clear eyed.<br /><br />The album feels like it's the most personal Bowie has ever released.  \\"The Next Day\\" uses a chorus that begins with: \\"Here I am / Not quite dying / My body left to rot in a hollow tree.\\"  The song is a triumphant (and knowing) return to form.  Bowie isn't rejecting his age here, he's embracing it and using it as a personal challenge.  \\"Where Are We Now?\\" is a meditation on a former life, back in Berlin in the late 1970's.  \\"Heat\\" has a few haunting moments in its slow, paranoid crawl as well.<br /><br />For what it's worth, THE NEXT DAY is the best (and most consistent) album that Bowie has released since 1980's SCARY MONSTERS.  This album feels like Bowie is comfortable with his own legacy; we see plenty of the trademark Bowie hallmarks here.  I don't feel like there's any standout single like \\"Changes\\" or \\"Starman\\" or \\"Heroes,\\" but this album makes up for it in its consistency.  I would recommend this album to any fans of Bowie's, but I think that newcomers will find a lot here to enjoy as well.  The fact that this album exists at all is a wonder, but the fact that it's a great one is more than I can ask for as a fan.<br /><br />Essential tracks to sample/listen: \\"The Next Day,\\" \\"Valentine's Day,\\" and \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight).\\"<br /><br />Additional release information:<br />THE NEXT DAY was also released in a deluxe edition.  The deluxe edition of the album comes with three songs that do not appear on the full version.  These songs are \\"So She,\\" \\"Plan,\\" and \\"I'll Take You There.\\"  Out of these three songs, one of them is an instrumental: \\"Plan\\" appears on the \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" video as the opening minute and a half before the video begins proper.  The remaining two tracks are good, but they don't quite compare to the other songs on THE NEXT DAY.  I'd recommend this version for the Bowie fanatic, but it isn't essential listening.ie isn't rejecting his age here, he's embracing it and using it as a personal challenge.  \\"Where Are We Now?\\" is a meditation on a former life, back in Berlin in the late 1970's.  \\"Heat\\" has a few haunting moments in its slow, paranoid crawl as well.<br /><br />For what it's worth, THE NEXT DAY is the best (and most consistent) album that Bowie has released since 1980's SCARY MONSTERS.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I really like this game, but it needs more levels.  Some of the hidden object portions of the game are a little to dark to see the hidden objects. But in all I enjoy this game.
B00BHU261S|5.0|It was a great movie<br />Watched while walking on treadmill<br />I would recommend it if you like Hitchcock movies like I do
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Fantastic story based on plausible scientific theory. Exciting ... kept me on edge of seat entire book. Didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />Bob Graham
B001N1DPDE|5.0|this is a massive bad ass knife.... best knife to carry on a field trip.. Just buy it!! you will not regret..
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is my second time reading the unabridged version. It is by far one of the best books in the world.Victor Hugo's style of writing is truly unique. This book makes me cry often. I have seen the last two movie adaptations and as always the book is by far the better choice. If you want to read a story that seems so real about how being good does really pay off, this is the book for you. I wish I can be Jean Valjean. He is an inspiration in my life.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Completely caught me off guard.  Did not even know half of the things in the book existed.  Leaves you wanting to read more.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|I'll keep this review short. What's The Next Day like? Fantastic. Far better than Reality, even better than Heathen and I consider those excellent Bowie albums. I will say confidently this is his best album since Scary Monsters which is my personal favorite.<br />Sound-wise it blends the edge of Scary Monsters and sprinkles over a bit of all his other personalities primarily Heroes and mixes it all up with that now mature sound as heard on Heathen.<br />It's a brilliant album, a real album like the ones you used to have to listen to multiple times and digest its meaning and intricacies. It sure runs tracks around a lot of the fast food style sound you now hear on the radio that's meant to pass as 'music'.<br />Do yourself a favor and add Next Day to your collection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved how twisted their relationship is/was and how they help each other heal.  Makes you want more to the story.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Ordered on Saturday and received it on Monday. Impressed!<br /><br />The charger is well made and fits perfectly. There is a slight indentation on one side, so it is easy to tell which side is \\"up\\" even in low lighting. Pops into place via the magnets securely.<br /><br />As other reviews mention, charging via the pogo cable is faster than the supplied USB connector.<br /><br />Very pleased.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is fun. At first the controls where kinda hard to use but it only takes a few seconds to get used to them. Once you get used to them it's deffinately a game worth buying. This game has many different puzzles that are sometimes head scratchers at first but can be solved quite easy when you really look at it. I think $1.99 is a reasonable price for this game if you don't manage to get it while it's the free app of the day. Hope this helps. Thanks for reading.
B005LTDPJI|5.0|Currently Amazon is not stocking this, but if you are a more than casual fan of Electric Light Orchestra, this is a must have, and you can find it at other market places (including 3rd Party Amazon Merchants) new, for less than $50.  Do not pay more than that, it is not necessary (unless this review becomes outdated and you are now looking for a \\"collectors\\" gem!<br /><br />Throughout the last decade, Sony began re-releasing the ELO catalogue, remastered, with bonus tracks, and with very extensive and well-crafted booklets for each CD.  Very nice and historical for the die-hard ELO fan, or the novice who just had a Light bulb moment!  I already had two of those, my two favorites (On The Third Day and Eldorado) when I was made aware of this set!  Well, I found a great price and purchased this (Amazon was selling it for over $80 and I found it for under $50 at a reputable online dealer).  What you get is all of the re-mastered, post-millenium releases, of the entire Electric Light Orchestra studio album catalogue, handsomely packaged in a box with a booklet, and each album is in a CD sized miniature replica of the original album.  If it was a gatefold cover, the mini-album is faithful to the reproduction.  Don't plan on being able to read the writing (notes, song lists) of the original.  For that you need the booklet.<br /><br />Now the only drawback, is that each individual Sony release had extensive notes by Jeff Lynne, historical data by a contributor, all the album cover variants and artwork, lyrics, etc.  Unfortunately, the Epic Legacy box release only supplies the Jeff Lynne notes and track listing.  No extensive album art or lyrics included in this version.  You will save money however this way, but the reader's digest condensed version of the eleven booklets into one, leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The sound of each album on CD, remastered is beautiful, in some cases better than I remember the originals.  Some rather scathing reviews at individual albums on Amazon might frighten you into thinking there is something wrong, but I can attest that my wonderful stereo system, my Boston Acoustics in the car, and my Bose headphones have found NO tape hiss, no incongruities, no chopped tops or bottoms from \\"loudness wars\\", the reproduction has been pure and faithful to the original masters and the albums sound glorious!<br /><br />If you want to read my individual reviews of these albums, you will have to find them at each entry, as some folks have expressed disappointment when I review every album in a box set, or multiples which go together.  \\"Your review is too long!\\"<br /><br />Let it be said, there is a reason that John Lennon called ELO \\"Son of Beatles\\".  There is a reason Jeff Lynne became best friends with George Harrison and Tom Petty.  There is a reason Paul McCartney and George Martin asked Jeff to assist with the final productions of the Beatles Anthology series.  There is a reason he was chosen to produce, engineer, and play on Roy Orbison's last album (Mystery Girl) and George Harrison's Cloud 9, and co-wrote and co-produced Tom Petty's Full Moon Fever album (and Heartbreakers Into The Great Wide Open album).  There is a reason Jeff Lynne is one of the most admired and trusted personalities in the music industry, despite some of his critics. Jeff is close friends with all the Beatles and their partners alive and passed, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Eric Clapton, Elton John, Brian Wilson, Duanne Eddy, Joe Walsh, and Randy Newman, among many others.<br /><br />Jeff Lynne and The Electric Light Orchestra are a classic fixture in many adults lives, and in spite of some scathing reviews in the past, ELO provided not only a soundtrack to our lives, but influenced hundreds of current musicians around the globe.<br /><br />This is a magnificent collection of 11 planets you can visit, in any order you like depending on your tastes.  (I actually don't care much for one, but it is growing on me, and another one which I usedto not like at all, has gained my respect after many years of false prejudice).  Others which were my all time favorites are now immortalized forever in digital fortresses where only a solar apocalypse can wipe them out...to not like at all, has gained my respect after many years of false prejudice).

B00BHU261S|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie about Hitchcock and his wife and the behind the scenes making of the movie Psycho. The complicated relationship of the Hitchcocks combined with gems like the censors freaking out at the idea of showing a flushing toilet held my attention and didn't allow this period piece to lose my interest

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great, but it should be called &quot;Dan's Horse&quot; because Dan the stable hand is obviously running the show. He won't let me have two seconds alone with beautiful Bulldozer (who he told me I was going to be able to name, then promptly named her &quot;Beauty&quot; instead. It's a horse, not a kitten!). What is he like in love with the horses or something? I've got one thing to say and that's, Dan, keep your hands off my baby Bulldozer!

B009YN2M7S|5.0|I couldn't stop reading! The book was written so well and the ending is unbelievable. I wish everyone would read this! Illustrates love and the horrid of abuse so well and I can't wait to watch the movie!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This movie is a must see for every gamer over the age of 25 simply for the nostalgia. For those under 25 it's still a must see but you may not get a few of the older inside jokes. Even if you got not a single inside joke this movie is still a 5 star movie no questions asked. As a final bit of clarification, the &#34;inside&#34; jokes are done in a wonderfully fun way, there's no snotty &#34;better than you&#34; quality to the jokes. So whether you catch the jokes or not, you're sure to love this film.

B00846WWVM|5.0|Graphics are awesome, water physics is pretty much perfect.  Addicting.  Not impossible to figure out the puzzles, but difficult enough to enjoy and not get bored.<br /><br />Great game.  Wish I could get back what I already paid when released.

B004MPRWJG|4.0|Just what I expected.  A book is so much better than a movie, a book, a mestic, a insight of self- perversation and a enjoyable read.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|Donnie Yen has become one of my favorite actors and this is no exception. Picking up right where IP Man 1 left off, it is a kick ass kung fu bonanza. The story is fantastic.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I've only been playing for a short time on this game and it already amazed me. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is almost flawless. The controls are smooth and easy once you get used too it and the items you can buy are actually nice. Now I have too admit that it's hard to get coins and get too the check points in time, but who cares when you're having so much fun. Definitely a must have game.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm really not one for these games, but my son and I really had fun with this. It required using our knowledge of physics and gave us the opportunity to spend some 'interesting 'time together!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a great deal of fun. I am glad that the first option does not have a time limit. I find I don't do very well with games that have time limits, as I never finish before the time is up.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Great game , very relaxing and fun. Crashed a few times at first but kept trying and have no problems since. Will probably go ahead and purchase the full game cause it's worth it

Check out Van's Facebook page too, he's posted two live shows from last year plus several of these songs played live.  The East Belfast show from 2012 is AWESOME.  My MP3 software says I've listened to this 63 times, so it must be good.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I would have given this a five star review if not for the way the current version implements content sharing.<br /><br />I accidentally updated by pressing update all and things are all messed up.<br /><br />The current Kindle  application doesn't allow multiple Amazon accounts to register on the same iPad. Past versions allowed people sharing a single iPad to register the device with multiple logins.<br /><br />This is a issue if family members have separate Amazon accounts, as do my spouse and I. When you deregister the ipad, ALL content goes away, so you can't keep a book on ipad from your spouse's login.<br /><br />If my spouse were to buy a real, physical book, she could hand it across the couch to me to read when she finished it. Of course, if I was in the middle of reading MY book, I could put HER book aside to read later. We cold even put all our books on the same bookcase in the den!<br /><br />With this app, I must register the tablet to her account to read her book, which removes ALL MY books. When I go back to MY account, all of my bookmarks, etc are lost.<br /><br />This is the real world equivalent of returning all my books to amazon before reading any books my wife loaned me and having amazon take out my bookmarks,<br /><br />Amazon has the ability to share via &#34;lending,&#34; which would work, if more titles qualified. The selection is so random that I can see no pattern, which can only mean greed or lawyers are lurking. Amazon also shares Prime access for family members, which could provide infrastructure for book sharing.<br /><br />Apple deals with multiple user sharing by requiring each account to validate with a credit card as well as user name and password. This is a prudent safeguard, and prevents wild sharing and renegade publishing because the credit card requirement inhibits unsafe sharing habits.<br /><br />This would be less of a problem if prices for books were considerably less than for print, which after careful consideration, seems fair as the eBook paradigm as implemented provides substantially less value than a real book.fair as the eBook paradigm as implemented provides substantially less value than a real book.
0812550706|5.0|I remember having to read this book in middle school expecting it to be just another boring book I had to read for school.  I was dead wrong.  Ender's Game was an amazing read and sparked my interest in sci-fi books.  It also was a good introduction into the rest of the Ender universe.  Card does a spectacular job of creating real characters and environments. A fantastic read!

B00AI41PSY|4.0|I purchased this little bauble, and it's not bad.  4 out of 5 stars, because I am a HUGE Electric Light Orchestra fan, and I have just about everything they ever did.  The problem lies in Mr. Lynne re-making the songs, with mostly himself as the artist.  I used to do things like that, when I was writing songs, and no one else wanted to play them, but c'mon.  The old tracks are still the best.  This re-hash is NEW, and that is all it is.  It is not BETTER, by any means.  It does show Mr. Lynne's recording, producing, and instrumental talent, but his voice is not what it used to be.  What I am trying to say is, if you want to hear GREAT songs, by the Electric Light Orchestra, buy the old tracks, and hear how they were SUPPOSED TO SOUND.  This is an \\"UPDATE\\" of the music, and seems to lack the complexity, and depth, and compounded quality that results from multiple great talents, united in a musical cause.  Don't get me wrong, if you already know this band inside-out, like I do, then get it.  It's fun.  But if you want to hear the real thing, in all it's glorious intricacies, and excellent production, go get some of the oldies.  Eldorado, A New Worlds Record, and Out Of The Blue are FANTASTIC.  Dive in!!!
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|Many people very negatively compare this to the \\"core 4\\" albums released in his lifetime, or say that it's not even as good as \\"First Rays...\\" or \\"South Saturn...\\" First I have to say that of course it can't possibly be as good as those  -  they were composed of all he did or nearly finished during his life. If, however, you are like me and are a person who likes even the \\"lesser\\" recordings, those discovered after his death, then this is a very good album in my opinion. It is definitely as good as \\"Valleys of Neptune\\", in fact I think it's a bit better. Per usual, there are some alternate versions of existing material, but in some ways, very alternate, at times as if they are different songs. Case in point, there is an instrumental that is based off the riff of EZY Rider, but played VERY slowly, with different sound effects and sections not on the final song. It's an excellent piece in its own right. There are some things not available elsewhere  -  sure, the single \\"Somewhere\\" first surfaced on the abomination \\"Crash Landing\\" and later on the 2000 purple box set  -  but this is yet again different, with lead guitar sections, and very good ones at that, not on either previous version.<br />So I feel that if you are a Hendrix fan, and not too \\"anything that was released after he died is crap\\", then this is a worthy addition to his posthumous work. I feel that in many cases there are things he would not want released, but in other cases there are things he very well might have wanted out in some similar form, and that there is no way to tell either way. Regarding other albums  --  who knows about \\"Red House\\"? Most people feel that the one on \\"In the West\\" is undoubtedly the finest version. That was a posthumous release. And it's known that he did not like the truncated version his record company insisted on during his lifetime.<br />Another thing, and this is really just my opinion, one that most will disagree with: even if this is not what he would have wanted, evenif this is terrible grave robbing, even if this is just a money grab on his estate's part, even if some of this is tampered with  -  I still love Hendrix and want to hear anything he was working on. It's great stuff  -  his rejects are better than most people's finest work. He very well might have understood how much his fans cared/care about him and very well may have been forgiving that many would want anything he has done.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Well made and acted! I'm sure it means more to the viewer if you lived it in the news every day. They didn't lament the government inaction for such a ridiculously long time, but otherwise very accurate portrayal.<br /><br />I haven't seen Lincoln yet, but it is the best I've seen in a year or two.<br />I don't know why Hollywood had stopped making very many movies of this caliber.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first book and the 2nd was pretty good but this final one in the series wasn't as exciting to me. It took me longer to read as my interest waned. It felt like the author was struggling with this one. I'm still glad I read the entire series though and I'm looking forward to the next movie ... This fall, is it?
B00B4MUSHI|4.0|The battle soundtrack for MGR was fantastic. Blending just the right amount of heavy, driving rock with just enough electronica/wub wub dubstep makes the soundtrack an instant adrenaline rush, especially when the vocals kick in. It's a good thing this album was made available; I was disappointed the Limited Edition of the game didn't come with this track.<br /><br />This album is a bit incomplete though. There are 29 track on this album and they are all in the game. But there are some tracks in the game that are missing from this album.<br />The song \\"Locked and Loaded\\" is mysteriously missing from this album. The boss enemy theme songs come in multiple forms (in-game, original, extended, instrumental). But only the in-game and instrumental forms are found on this album.<br /><br />Either way, it's a great soundtrack to have. If you have the game, getting this with it is a no-brainer.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall continues the Bond adventure - great movie! The combination Blue-ray and regular DVD discs allow the movie to be enjoyed virtually anywhere. Great price!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Finished this book and immediately went on line and bought the 4 book set.  Finishing the 4th book right now and getting ready to buy the 5th book.  This is too much fun, a true guilty pleasure and something for everyone with a sense of fantasy and fun.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I'm drawn into the atmosphere of this show. I will say that I'm disappointed with the ending of the season finale. I seen it coming and I an alternative tragedy could of been thought up. Will still watch though.

B003B02PEU|5.0|Enjoyed this novel, it was a light and quick read. Enjoyed the development<br /> of the characters, was sad to see it end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It really is a wonderfully written, performed and designed show.  It has a nice mix of characters, that show genuine class is not based on your affluence, but your character.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon's Instant Video system isn't better.  Buying directly through Google Play works much better, but you can get this show free if you are a Prime member.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love this show... Just started watching it and I am totally obsessed!  It is such a great storyline and I can't help but root for SAMCRO.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved the book! It was the best book ever! Don't even doubt that you will like it! It was adventurous, funny, mysterious and awesome! I TOTALLY recommend this book. Especially to people who love adventure! GET IT!!!!
B00BKTWBMA|3.0|I've been a fan of Slow Hand my whole life. Love his searing guitar work from the past and the tastefulness of his current style.<br />But, I'm somewhat dissapointed in the album as a whole. Even though, when I heard Gotta Get Over, I was hoping for a full project like this.<br />It's in my opinion the best cut on the cd, followed by J.J. Cale's Angel and the traditional Goodnight Irene, which could have fit comfortably on the Unplugged album. With those things in mine, I'm thankful that any artist can arrive at a place where they can perform and record the songs they want. He's pay his dues and it's not about me the fan, it's about his own journey and I wish him the best for the best.

B0031RS2HC|5.0|Only took me 3 days to read through it.  I couldnt put it down and went straight onto &#34;Die Trying&#34;
0307361012|4.0|I read all the other HH novels before this one, so everything was a bit backwards for me when I read this. It would have been nice to know how to say \\"Hole\\" from earlier than the last book. The story was engaging and quick moving, and it really shows a different side of Harry. I did think that maybe the story moved along a little too fast to properly portray the impact that events had on Harry. Maybe it's the translation, but it's almost as if everything superfluous was edited out so only the story remained. Recommend!
B005LAIII0|5.0|The Short: A visual marvel. A human triumph. A test of faith. Finding God. An incredible story. Life of Pi is this and many other things, sweeping the viewer away into a mesmerizing place that blurs the lines between dream and what is real.<br /><br />Ang Lee directs the previously thought un-filmable book to the big screen, Life of Pi. How it comes to life is breathtaking; an ingeniously woven tapestry of incredible visual elements and powerfully adept storytelling, all to the affect of discovering the greater meaning of being alive in a situation you would rather die in.<br /><br />It's an art movie that many audiences will love simply because of the gorgeous visuals, memorable character(s), and incredible spectacle. But for those looking for a deeper, meaty, and memorable movie going experience Life of Pi has you covered. No other movie nominated for best picture at the 2013 Oscars has perplexed me, moved me, made me reflect and think, and swept me away within its lush, visual imagery and unique storytelling. It's a film chock full of metaphor, visual imagery, and raw emotion. But this isn't a discussion of the film's many layers of religious undertones and imagery, but a review. I'll keep it that way!<br /><br />First off is director Ang Lee's incredible talent on display (for which he won Best Director - 2013). I have yet to read Life of Pi but from what I've heard from friends and book junkies is that Life of Pi is an incredibly complex, almost muddy in direction, novel which many considered un-filmable. What becomes of this epic tale of survival is a clean and expertly directed film, with all of its themes and underlying tones hidden within the visual landscape and story. It's not a force-fed experience, but rather one where you must process the vast array of information and make your own judgment on some of its less touched-on ideas. Whatever creative process Mr. Lee went through to bring this incredibly complex adventure to life is beyond me, and that's a true testament of the genius on display.<br /><br />You can't talk about Life of Pi without discussing the incredible visuals. Winning both Best Cinematography (2013) and Best Special Effects (2013) at the 2013 Academy Awards, I had high expectations going into Life of Pi. The film starts off, simply put, like any other PG-rated family film. I was nervous that it was going to be a bust. Where the film takes the viewer is someplace completely unique and unexpected. Without spoiling some of the finer moments, Life of Pi has visual panache to spare. There are some incredible moments that are rendered and recreated with such life-like detail that getting lost in Pi's tale is tremendously easy. Its visuals dazzle, but don't distract its storytelling, unlike other films (namely Avatar, which is a visual marvel but hardly a groundbreaking example of storytelling). One of the main strengths in Life of Pi is Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger that accompanies Pi during his quest. Little did I know that that 90 percent of his screen-time is completely computer animated. And it's not just that, but the rest of the film; the water effects, the tumbling ship, various animals; all of it is incredible. It maintains a perfect balance of realism and a dream-like quality. Some of the scenes are also shot with incredible vision and beauty. It's simply the most beautiful cinematography of any film last year (other than the Hobbit). I have nothing but praise for Life of Pi's cinematographer and special effects team.<br /><br />But no story is worth being told without great characters and actors to tell them. Life of Pi's Suraj Sharma (Pi) is absolutely fantastic. Emotional, powerful, and sincere; he is one seriously talented actor for never having been in a role before...ever. While the beginning of the film features a quick romance between Pi and Gita, featuring its fair share of awkward exchanges, its nothing annoying. Pi and his incredible story is what you see 90 percent of the time. It's his story of finding faith in the darkest of times, discovering courage where none should be present, and having the will to continue to live. The rest of the supporting cast does just fine in their various roles, aiding along the telling of a most grandiose adventure.<br /><br />Everything else is spectacular as well. The original score (also winning the Oscar for Best Score - 2013) fits the pages of Pi's story like clockwork. From the moving \\"Pi's Lullaby\\" to the gorgeous and ethereal \\"First Night, First Day\\", the original score never distracts but rather augments the experience, creating some of the most beautiful audio-visual-scapes in any film from recent memory. Sound editing is particularly fantastic. Crashing waves, minute sound effects; it's all done particularly well, especially in its transition to home video (aside from a couple of weird boom adjustments made mid scene that distract the acute ear). And boy, I can only imagine the splendor of the 3D this film had to offer but I, regretfully, was not able to see it in theaters, only on Blu-Ray. The one issue I had with the visual presentation was this, also noticed by Blu-Ray.com: \\"There are two spots in the film where the aspect ratio changes suddenly from the normal 1.85:1. During the \\"flying fish\\" sequence that was used as a teaser for the movie, the top and bottom close in to 2.35:1, and there's a single overhead shot of a whale passing beneath the lifeboat that inexplicably squeezes in to a window-boxed 1.33:1. I'm not sure what the rationale or workflow was here, so I can't really comment on it, but don't be alarmed by the out-of-nowhere framing changes.\\" In layman's terms, the film goes from a whole-screen experience to having the black bars on the top and bottom and sides during two scenes, which is fairly distracting.<br /><br />Where Pi finishes his journey is up to you to discover and interpret. Where it stands for me, personally, is my favorite film of 2012. Visually spectacular, incredibly engaging, intricately told, and masterfully directed, Life of Pi was a massive gamble that pays off in more ways than one. It's an absolute classic.<br /><br />5/5 - Spectacular, Sensational; insert your own positive descriptor here and go see this movie!t's his story of finding faith in the darkest of times, discovering courage where none should be present, and having the will to continue to live.

B00280LYIM|5.0|One of the best books out of the series, actually the best to me. It had a lot if cute moments funny moments and what if moments!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I get a lot of mail coming into my Yahoo email address. Mostly junk. This thing would run ALL the time, not just on demand. Consequently it would be downloading mail while trying to do other things, making my first gen Kindle Fire nearly unusable and extremely sluggish. I could find no way to make it stop this behavior. The mail client itself was actually pretty good, and I did like it overall. The cons of being unable to use my tablet without killing the Yahoo mail client the bad way outweighed the benefits of having it. Yahoo, make a lighter weight client. Most tablets and phones aren't super computers with great multitasking capabilities.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This is an excellent game with tasty graphics and colors, way better than the original windows release back in the eighties
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Refreshing to read about mental illness in this way. We all have our dark secrets. To find love despite our baggage is truly a miracle.  I saw the movie before reading the book. While I loved the movie, I think the book is more honest and not pushing for the happily ever after climax that we see in movies.  Definitely worth reading.
B00846WWVM|5.0|I've seen and read good reviews about this game and always wanted to see what it's about! Since Amazon made it the FAOTD, I can play with it all I want!<br /><br />The gameplay is pretty simple and easy enough but can still be tricky:  maneuver the hose to put out the &quot;fire&quot; through a &quot;maze-like&quot; valley with the least amount of water used as possible.<br />Every level has a different kind of maze for your valley where you'll have to figure out how to get water to all parts of the fire.<br /><br />The graphics on my Note 2 is so clear and vivid! I can see the cute little creatures on both the hose and in the village. The music is pretty whimsical and matches the light atmosphere of the game.<br /><br />Even though regular price for the game would have been $1 or $2, it would be totally worth it if I had to pay.
B000EXZI1E|4.0|More of the stuff that the Bee Gees are famous for, plus a very pleasant blast from the past in the song, Blue Island.
1594487154|3.0|Daniel Pink has come up with some enlightening insights in the past, but unfortunately this book doesn't hit the mark.  The premise; that if you find yourself attempting to influence others on a regular basis, you're in sales, is pretty thin.  Yes, sales involves influence, but there is quite a bit more to it than that, and it's apparent that Mr. pink has never been in sales.  That's one of the problems I had with this book; Mr. Pink writes about an occupation he's clearly never held.  To be fair, he does offer some interesting observations and summaries of various studies, but when he actually attempts to give selling advice, as in when he discusses for mirroring and matching which he calls mimicking, the advice is just plain bad.  I teach sales and have for years.  I'm always on the lookout for some new tidbit or concept that I can incorporate into my classes.  Unfortunately this one provided little in the way of real meat.  An intersting read, but don't pick it up if you're looking for something to help you succeed in sales.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|One of Ms. Hunt's finest performances. When a film makes you really care about the characters you really invest in them as is the case with Sessions. I highly recommend it for an excellent narrative and outstanding execution. The dialog is excellent.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Being somewhat of a nerd I rather liked this book. It combines technology with a bit of fantasy. However, I was a little disappointed in the ending because I thought it was a bit dull. Other than that, it did keep my attention.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|As an experienced pilot I found far too many technical errors relative to the equipment and the commercial airline business. The plodding plot was made tolerable by the usual superior acting job of Mr. Washington. Any other star would have crash-landed this picture after 5 minutes.
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|I watch it with the kids, ages 5 and 9, and they both really enjoy the artwork, characters and story.  I like it too.  Beautifully done artwork and the story moves at a good pace.
B00936A0ZW|4.0|I really like this album from Paul Gilbert. What I like most is the rest of the musicians compliment his guitar work. The drummer especially - I believe it is Jeff Bowders - is superb, at times his drumming is as exciting as Paul's playing which makes it an album you can listen to over and over. Some of the lyrics and song themes are a bit questionable, i think he should get someone else to write his lyrics because they can be a little lame. If someone writes them for him, he should hire a new lyricist.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so happy to have been introduced to Downton Abbey series. I had heard about this during the Season 3 and had no idea how wonderful this drama is. I went to Amazon Prime and watched seasons one and two. Now that I have finally watched 3 I can't wait until Season 4 is available.
0307742997|3.0|Another great book let down by translation. It can't all be blamed on the author. There are some obvious mistakes that should never have made it to print.<br /><br />For example: \\"Blood suffused Oleg's cheeks.\\" - he blushed. Sounds lovely but this is not a flowery love story. And typos that make the sentence meaningless like ... \\"Her heaving, rasping breathlessness rent the tranquility;\\" what does that mean, rent = rend, i.e. to disturb (the air) sharply with loud noise?[...]. You, as the reader, will have to figure this out.<br /><br />I think why so many people say it was choppy is because there are a times sentences and paragraphs that follow each other and are totally unrelated to the context of the adjoining text. Also, when a new section starts, often there is no introduction or context to fit it in to the story which can be a bit confusing.<br /><br />I found the story a bit predictable but still and enjoyable read.
B008458O3S|5.0|Fun game! Very challenging. One problem I have is it's over!!! Need more puzzles! Feel like I just started and I'm done???
B006MW3UZW|3.0|My wife love this show,she give it a 5* but  I am hearing impaired and need Closed Captioning,  adjusting the volume on my tv makes the sound louder especially the music but not more understandable to me. I especially need Closed Captioning when the actors have accents, as in Downton Abbey.

141659521X|5.0|I have read all of the other Mitch Rapp novels and love them!! This one had an interesting twist. Spy stories are only as good as their characters. I care about him and can't wait to see what happens next.
B005I4JG80|5.0|Heard about this book from a friend, and I'm infatuated with the suggestions of how children are raised differently in a French culture. I've book-marked many of the suggestions and plan to make a ready-reference book for when my child is born in the upcoming months. It's a good read with some very valid points and interesting perspectives. Also has some witty and appreciated humor!
0553801473|3.0|There are about 5 characters I really care about in this absolutely depressing way overworked series of books. Too many characters, too many places, too much description for my taste. If I did not care so much about what happened to the Stark kids including Jon Snow, I would not keep reading them. With this book, along with the others, I have read over 5000 pages of violence.

030758836X|5.0|I really loved this book. A lot of people are saying that the ending petered out, but really, how else could you end it? (Spoilers!) Amy was so twisted, and she knew that Nick needed the twisting as much as she was willing to give it. With them staying together, I did really like that. I have suggested it to several friends.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I cant put it down, so addicting. The story line is very strange though. You don't need money to play unless you want to buy things, it's optional. It's totally free. I suggest this game to anyone who like hidden object games with a story.
0439023521|5.0|I thought this book was incredible. Daunting future, who to trust, friendships that are fragile. Katniss is a great heroine, actually one of the better ones in literature (and I have read a lot of books). Some people may have been horrified about having young teenagers put in a killing field, however think of The Giver, the main protogonist was 12/13. I know Amazon doesn't do more than 5 stars, but I would give this a 10/10.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I liked most of the movie but I didn't like the ending.  I thought it was unbelievable that in securing M, they were unable to get more security for her.
0439023513|3.0|Possible spoilers--- I was so impressed by The Hunger Games and I did really like Catching Fire too. However this book, I just plain didn't care for it. I would give it at 6/10 on a 10 star rating. I kept on having to re-read paragraphs, pages even, because I felt like things were not flowing like they should. In THG, I knew exactly what was going on because it was described well. In Mockingjay, I was confused. They kept saying they needed to protect her, then all of a sudden she was in the fields fighting. She went to the city to help, and pods were blowing up. What were pods? Did I miss something? I mean I figured it out, but without real help; a coworker of mine also felt confused with the pods. Things felt just too rushed with this book.
B006RBZV82|4.0|The photography was very well done, very clear and sharp. We watched this on a HD screen, I am sure IMAX would be the best.<br />The subject matter was very interesting and informative. We learned a lot and never realized the life that lays beneath the ocean. I would highly recommend this to anyone that is interested in science especially children.
B00BMVTTJ4|4.0|Firstly, I love the movie. I can't say enough good about this movie. So I won't start, or it will never stop. :)<br /><br />Secondly, it says you can &#34;download&#34; it, but in no way can you &#34;download&#34; the HD version to a computer. When they say you can play it back on Kindle Fire HD etc, that's exactly what they mean and nothing more. You proceed to get Amazon Unbox Video for computers, but you still can't download the HD version. Only the standard definition version. You also cannot stream the HD version, unless it is on those specific devices that they list, which does not include a computer.
B0084670FU|5.0|Great story telling feature.  Gave me a new perspective on how interconnected are lives really are and how unaware we can be on the effects of our actions.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Great music, and great soundtracks, from a great movie. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved The Hobbit! :)
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|It continues the Clifford Files in a great way.  I do think it ends in a way that is just begging for a fourth book.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|What a humble man - an incredible story - I want to know more please<br />Reccomend to every post teen
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A fun series (I have read all 3).  There is intrigue, love, suspense, all in typical Jeffrey Archer style.  Easy to read.  Waiting for a #4 though!!!
B00BFBSV72|5.0|its a fun infinite game, ht it also has acts, challennges and bonuses for killing enemies or collecting the three red rings. it also jas unlockables and temp items youc can buy for rings amd a story mode. although not a litteral STORY mode exactly its an act mode, its the reason i think is worth paying for.
B004478AS4|4.0|This book was an ok read. It's not what I would prefer to read in my free time. I had to read this book for a class.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I can guarantee you that you will never see another movie like this. The concept is incredible, absolutely amazing film.
B00BKTWBMA|2.0|this is a depressing piece of work even for a clapton junkie. Way to mellow. Bramhall needs to bring eric up to speed, not the other way around. To install a country song almost made me ill. Love the man. Had great conversation with him in the 80s. Something is wrong somewhere. Try trowers new roots and branches. It actually hurts to write this review. Looking for redemption @ crossroads new york!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This one of my ABSOLUTE favorite movies!!!  I would highly recommend it to anyone...not just a chick flick!  Really original!
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This movie was a true breath of fresh air in animation. An original, excellent story. Brought to life with wonderful new takes on age old characters. Truly, truly worth owning.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I love the history lessons from both books, (spoiler) I felt guilty for not feeling more empathy for Germans  during the Russian occupation of Germany, looking forward to book 3, and if there is a boycott of the 20$ kindle price for book 3, sorry Ken, but I'm in!
1451695195|5.0|Reading this book is like having a personal conversation With Dr. Alexander.  His writing skills are superbe.<br />He keeps your attention at all times.  This book is necessary reading for anyone who's struggling with<br />finding the answer to what happens when we breathe our last breath.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|We were told this movie would be good. To me, it kind of looked stupid funny…glass I watched it, it was HILARIOUS!

B000ICM0YY|3.0|(3.5/5 stars)<br /><br />Emil Gilels' recordings of Beethoven's sonatas were left incomplete due to his untimely passing in 1985. They are, however, complete enough that this collection withstands comparison to truly complete sets. As such, one must first acknowledge what is missing: #1 in F minor (Op. 2/1), #9 in E major (Op. 14/1), #22 in F major (Op. 54), #24 in F sharp major (Op. 78), and #32 in C minor (Op.111). The most glaring omission is the final sonata, but I would not be without the others either. It's hard to believe if you haven't experienced them, but there is no filler amongst Beethoven's published sonatas. The early electoral sonatas thrown in by DG have some curiosity value but do little to compensate for the missing published sonatas.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said for Gilels' powerful, virtuosic and flexible approach to the music, which never strains credibility. Sometimes the results are spectacular (examples: big, dramatic `Pathetique' and `Appassionata' sonatas, a virtuosic `Waldstein', and a rollicking Op. 10/3), but while he works within a successful template his playing often lacks warmth and sensitivity. The result is a  clinical `Hammerklavier', a bumbling first movement to the `Pastoral', a rather bland pair of Op. 2 sonatas, and the list goes on.  There are exceptions to these characterizations: His hushed pensive opening to Op. 109 defies the \\"vivace\\" indication, yet it is undeniably moving and his recording of that sonata remains a favorite. His Op. 110 is similarly convincing, conveying sensitivity and subtlety of feeling. Overall though, as I have conducted comparisons with other complete sets (Arrau, Goode, Gulda, and Kempff - mono), I have gradually lost interest in Gilels' recordings. Technically and intellectually he is a master of this music, but his playing lacks heart and spontaneity.<br /><br />The recordings were spread over the course of more than a decade and include the transition from analogue stereo to digital, yet the sound is strikingly uniform. Although very clear and well balanced, it has a clangy quality  that casts an edgy glare over the music. It's no showstopper, but it tends to exacerbate Gilels' lack of tonal warmth.<br /><br />There are many choices in this music, and although Gilels' was my first set of Beethoven sonatas it is not one I would recommend. If you are looking for virtuosic edge-of-your-seat playing, Gulda (on Eloquence) or Goode will satisfy while also conveying the warmth and spontaneity that are lacking in Gilels' set. If it is depth and introspection you seek, I recommend either Arrau (Decca) or Kempff (mono, DG import), each of which finds the heart of this music in their own way.

B000W7JWUA|3.0|I've played settlers a few dozen times, and after awhile, it's lost it's value. Board games have exploded in the past 10 years. Settlers was one of the pioneers for board games in america, and for that it should be owned by all, but I'd highly encourage you to look at some of the board games by Days of Wonder.<br /><br />Settlers has been reviewed and talked about over time.  My biggest complaint is that the base game requires 3 or 4 players. There are many games out there now that allow for 2-4, or 3-6 players, which makes the games much more playable. There are certain games that are much more accessible to people as well.<br /><br />I'm thankful I own this game, but it is no longer the top board game for people to buy.

B002YCVX5S|3.0|I feel it is unnecessary to stress the absolute mastery of the set emanating from Tarantino's direction,especially where \\"violence\\"is the \\"issue on hand\\".He has long ago established himself as one of the masters in this field.All in all a great movie.With a fantastic actor, a true pastmaster of the art of acting,Christopher Waltz,giving free acting lessons to anyone concerned.<br />But.Yes,there is a but  that,to me ,at least,raises significant concerns.<br />In the last few years we see,more frequently than ever before,historical or pseudo-historical movies emerging from Hollywood.Unfortunately with every passing year it seems that respect to historical fact evaporates more and more.It is ,however,one thing to observe movies completely misrepresenting what took place twenty, or even thirty,centuries ago(believe me,being Greek know very well what this means)and a completely different,as well as alarming,or even frightening thing,to watch a total twist of major historical events that took place only a few decades ago.<br />No matter how gullible one is,one cannot possibly believe that today's totally historically illiterate youth,will be aware that Adolf Hitler and his cronies were NOT killed in a movie theatre in Paris by a few \\"heroic\\" american commandos(or assassins),but continued to cause terrible bloodshed to the bitter end in Berlin,many months later.Please note that I refer  to the same youngsters who think that Joseph Goebbels probably was a great German football player or that Charles De Gaulle must be some reknown  French fashion designer.<br />When you teach youngsters,in any way,(be that the intennet,movies,TV series or fairy tale books)of a past that never existed,a lot of things can happen,none of which could be good.Inability to distinguish between historical fact and fiction is very dangerous,as well as a potential means to en end.A very nefarious end.<br />For,as the great George Orwell put it in his visionary novel\\"1984\\" : \\"\\"He who controls the present,controls the past.And he who controls the past,controls the future\\"\\".

0385349947|5.0|From the public discourse surrounding this book, I was expecting a polemic, elitist tone. It is anything but. It is a great read with a good combination of personal stories, social research, business advice, and social commentary. While Sandberg has been criticized for focusing on the psychological, rather than institutional, barriers that prevent women from attaining leadership positions, she is very clear in the first few pages that she full recognizes the very real institutional barriers that exist - it's just not what this book is about. She is focused on the ways women hold themselves back, on pervading gender stereotypes and judgements that impact and are perpetuated by both men and women, and on how to change these. She is very clear that she believes work to change both the institutional and psychological barriers needs to occur together.<br /><br />As for the argument that this book is elitist, that seems very unfair. Yes, Sandberg is very wealthy and can afford lots of help. Does that mean she shouldn't share her experience? She is one of the few women at her level of executive leadership, and part of the power of this book is the personal stories she tells. She doesn't make any claim that her experiences are relevant to everyone, and in fact, continually references the fact that she knows they are not. She is focused on women in business, and possibly government, that have the potential and desire to move up the ladder (or jungle gym, as she makes a case for changing the metaphor.) And for that audience, and anyone working in these arenas, this book has a lot of interesting things to say.<br /><br />So who is the audience for this book? I would say anyone working in a corporate environment, any woman looking for career advice, and anyone interested in gender issues. I fall into the third category, although at one time I fell into the first two, and am now one of the women who made a different choice from Sandberg - I left the corporate workforce when my children were born. I resonated with so many of her corporate stories, but as a one-time stay-at-home and now work-at-home mom, I also didn't feel the least bit put-off by anything she said. She avoids the 'mommy wars', and makes a great case for ending them altogether.<br /><br />You may not agree with everything Sandberg says, as I did not, but her book will make you think, and want to discuss, what she says. Isn't that what good books do?hildren were born.

0062014536|5.0|If you've been reading the Delirium series from the start, you've probably been dying for this final book to come out.  I'm such a fan of this series, and of Lauren Oliver as a whole, so I've been recommending the series to pretty much anyone who would listen.  And I couldn't get it open fast enough the day it came out.  Fortunately, I had just finished a book so I was completely ready for the wonderful world that Lena and Hana live in.<br /><br />Prior to reading this novel, I knew the perspective was going to alternate from Lena to Hana, and I wasn't sure how I felt about that.  I didn't love the way Pandemonium flowed, which alternated from Lena's present to her past, so I was worried I would have similar issues with this one.  However, for whatever reason, it worked really well for me as I was reading.  Lauren Oliver does a great job of weaving the stories so they contribute to the novel as a whole, each growing closer together in time until they come together.<br /><br />As the reader, we've essentially been following Lena's story from the start, and at the beginning of the novel, hers picks up pretty closely to where it left off in Pandemonium.  Since leaving Zombieland and coming to the Wilds, Lena has been slowly becoming a part of the revolution, whether she wants to be or not.  To a large extent, she seems to just want happiness, but no one can really survive in the Wilds on their own, so the few people who aren't interested in the fight sort of get brought into it anyway.  She's also dealing with an internal struggle of her own - how does she deal with the return of Alex when she's got Julien, who is new to the Wilds and in some ways, only came along with them because of his feelings for Lena.  In a sense, Lena is to Julien what Alex was to her.  She would have gone along with the cure had it not been for meeting Alex, and we as the reader don't really know what Julien ultimately would have done had it not been for Lena.<br /><br />Hana's story is somewhat new to us, although if you read the short story Hana, you'll see some of the same information.  We pick her thread up after she has had her procedure, in the weeks leading up to her marriage to Fred Hargrove.  I really enjoyed the differences in how Hana thought about things versus Lena - Hana mentions feeling guilt for some of the things she did that previous summer, and expresses fear that perhaps her cure didn't quite work, but everything with her is a bit muted.  I felt like we really knew Lena this whole time, because although she's grown, she didn't get cured and she remains herself at her core.  Hana, on the other hand, is a bit unpredictable because she knows she's supposed to act in specific ways as a result of her cure, but there is that leftover something else underneath, so you never really know which side is going to win.<br /><br />My emotions were running pretty high throughout most of the novel, and I don't think I've cried that much during a book since reading the last in the Harry Potter series.  The story as a whole is just fantastic, and I loved pretty much every minute of it.  As is the case with all good series, I'm left wanting more, and I'm hoping that Lauren Oliver will write another series based on these characters.  If nothing else, we end not quite knowing what happened to several people, and I would love to find that out some day.  And there's the ever present question - regardless of the ultimate outcome, how do you rebuild your society after any of these events?t new to us, although if you read the short story Hana, you'll see some of the same information.

B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I, too, an one of the uber-geeks who has seen nearly every film production of Jane Eyre, most of them severely wanting.  All leave out a plot point or two considered significant by us self-appointed guardians of the novel.  However, whether a film adaptation sports canyon-sized plot holes or remains sheepdog-faithful to the end, CASTING IS EVERYTHING.  The play of characters as they dance and collide,nuances of expression and gesture and all that is unspoken and not left to written dialogue--this is what matters.  Chemistry matters. And yes, the actors should bear some likeness to the characters they portray (example:  I respect George C. Scott, but as 35-year-old Rochester? Please.  A little hair dye does not erase the wrinkles and sags of age).  What's more, actors should understand their characters at an essential level, not just zero in on easily-identified traits (such as Rochester's seething, surly, uncomfortably intense side) and let those dominate the portrayal.  People are complicated.  Acting should reflect that. That's what ruined the Samantha Morton/Ciaran Hinds pairing.<br /><br />  To reiterate some of that review:  Want a better, more lush, fleshed-out, warm-hearted version? Although he does not answer the Rochester character in looks as well as Hinds, Tobey Stephens in the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation is way, way better: rude and gruff by turns,then vulnerable; guilty over his inability to be kind to Adele, with a tortured sense of duty to Bertha; his expressions and manner soften, his banter with Jane is amusing and the pivotal romantic scene is tender, fulfilling in the way it should be. Ruth Wilson herself is lovely, plain one moment and a shining pearl the next--perfect casting there. Forgive my directness,but you can picture Wilson and Stephens making love, and the thought does not make you shudder. There you have it. This should be a love story. The unexpected physicality--Jane Eyre usually gives us dry heat, not humidity--was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br /> Also well-wrought, although she is older than Adele is meant to be, was the young actress's portrayal of Rochester's poor little orphaned ward, with her opera-dancer mother's glittery affectations and flourishes, but, beneath the froufrou, a love-starved child seeking a parent.  The little \\"Georgie\\" girl who played Jane as a child, and who depicted Lucy so nicely in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, made the most of a smallish role:  her Jane was neither saccharine nor stiff, but the precocious, stifled-but-passionate ten-year-old who grew into the light-under-a-bushel young woman of the story.  Andrew Buchan was more appealing as St.John than I'd ever thought possible, making Jane's struggle well, more of a struggle.  And Bertha Mason is finally portrayed with some hint that she is not the grotesque she-devil that was the early-Victorian understanding of mental illness, but a tortured, once-beautiful woman condemned to imprisonment.  Her death scene is haunting rather than a \\"good riddance\\" moment, as it's been done in other versions.  Good supporting cast, and, although the post-Thornfield sequence with the Rivers family is a bit rushed, what there was was warm and charming.  Although I already knew the story,the Rochester-Jane reunion was nevertheless moving, Rochester's raw anguish-to-joy transformation evidence of the heart's ability to heal. Altogether, a satisfying production.

My only disappointment with this film is the lack of depth with the boss fight scene with now  monster-turned Carrie-Ann Moss against Pyramid Head. This was a defining moment but sadly it just turned to fluff.. that was badly edited I think.<br />  Some of the characters weren't given a good back story as well, most likely they were short of both budget and time constraints.<br /><br />  Good 3D effects.. even the special feature section although short was shot in 3D.<br /><br />  Overall I still rate highly because it has a lot of elements from the Silent Hill franchise - the atmosphere, the creepy characters if not the cult factor.

It may be getting a slight star boost because of that, because I was really expecting something along the lines of Punisher: War Zone (which was pretty awful). But I really enjoyed Dredd. There was an actual story and the concept stayed faithful to the comics. Karl Urban was great, which is saying a lot since we never get to see his face. That's what I call impressive acting. The expressions he was able to convey just through his voice and mouth. So, yeah, it was gruesome in spots, but, overall, the movie really worked.

B00AYQNOU8|1.0|Beautiful but subtitles of the locations would be helpful. Not really a movie but a whole lot of pictures. I understand the concept of samsara and at times that's what the movie  felt like.
