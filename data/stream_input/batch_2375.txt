B009NPA3Q4|4.0|I really like this young man. The only thing I would say about this album is about the mix. This has been said before by others but it seems to me that sometimes the music over powers his voice.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|We rented this one evening, hoping to watch a mindlessly entertaining action flick.  I also am a Bruce Willis fan, so that was a bonus.  Little did we know, however, that this movie has some great moral messages and even a twist ending.  I was surprised at how well I enjoyed this movie.  Well done!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie for it's story line and for the acting and special effects. I would recommend this movie to anyone especially those that life SYFY.
B002M9WW30|4.0|It was cheaper to just buy a Blue ray player than to get this in DVD. 2000 movies later I finally spent the money for this. Now I guess I can watch 3D stuff too. By the way, I would recommend this to any body who likes Stallone.......
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story line is so original that you can't really anticipate what is coming next. First part of a great trilogy.
B005PTYP70|4.0|I'm just a collector of movies and like to have all of the 1 2 3s and such of good movies. Things like Friday the 13th aren't  considered movies at all so that stuff stays on the shelf to collect dust.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I had missed a few episodes due to moving and not having cable yet.  I was very happy to find them on here and purchase them so I could catch up.  It was cheap and looked great on my 70 inch HD TV.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I was very pleased on the quick delivery and the product was in perfect condition. I love this movie and look forward to others.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this for my kindle fire to let my 4 year old play it when we are waiting for a table out to eat or grocery shopping.  Its great!
B008O037RG|5.0|Record arrived fairly fast, excellent condition and great sound! It also came with a code so that I can download the music that was on it onto my computer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, trashy, love story.  Not much else needed to say about that lol!  Worth the read and great to take on vacation and read at the beach or pool!
0525478817|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and was super excited when I not only had his signature in it, but it also had a Hanklerfish too. Arrived in perfect condition and this is an overall fantastic book and I highly recommend this book as well as the other three books John Green has written. (Looking for Alaska, Paper Towns, and An Abundance of Katherines)
0345529057|5.0|I loved the series on HBO.  Reading the books helped me understand the characters.  The show stays really close to the books.
B0074VA2T2|4.0|I thought this would be a little young for my kid at almost 5, but she loved the interaction of picking the food quantities and played each level through--usually she runs from educational games, so I liked that!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story line. Read this book in 3 days! I would definitely recommend this to my friends. Now I need to watch the movie.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I didn't have high hopes for this game, but after I got it I played all the levels in a couple of days, so it was a keeper!  I wish the navigation between &#34;books&#34; was a little easier, but the gameplay was fun and interesting, not hugely complicated.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game is fun but it is hard and takes some getting used to. Works well on kindle fire hd.

1250007208|5.0|[[Originally posted on my blog, In Wonderland]]<br />I loved this book! So much! I didn't think I was going to like it as much as I did. I was a little weary to start this book, but I am so glad that my collaborative book bloggers pushed me to read because our buddy reads for the month of April is Scarlet, which is the second installment to this series.<br /><br />So, what can I say about Cinder? Cinder is a cyborg. It takes place in the future, way in the future, approximately 126 years after WWIV, yes, that's right, World War 4! Since we haven't had a WWIII yet, and considering how long it has been since the last WW, you can only imagine how far into the future this is. So, that being said, androids/cyborgs should be common. There are hovercrafts and people living on the moon. Whoever said that this is a twist between the Cinderella fairy tale, The Terminator, and Star Wars, was exactly right. I couldn't explain it any better even if I tried.<br /><br />So, let's get down to it. Cinder, I thought it was spectacular. Ingenious really. Painstakingly beautiful; it kept me holding on to the edge of my seat. I barely got any sleep because I just kept wanting to know what was going to happen next. I literally could not put the book down.<br /><br />The characters. Let's see, Cinder was a sarcastic, smart, kickass heroine. I loved her as a character. Iko, one of my favorite characters ever! She's hilarious and I want her as my android and my friend! Peony, I wanted her as my sister. Kai... oh, what can I say about this dreamy heartthrob? Adri, hated her, with a passion; however, she fit the bill as evil stepmother perfectly. Same with Cinder's other stepsister, Pearl. What a bitch (excuse my language). And last but not least, Queen Lavena. The Lunar Queen, biggest bitch in the galaxy. Killing off her own family just so that she could take the throne, bitch please. The fact that she has \\"auburn\\" hair, we all know that means a reddish brown color. We all know my love for redheaded women. Just so the literary world knows, us redheads are not all evil, contrary to what people thought in the medieval times. I kind of went on a rant to some of my bookish friends about that, but oh well, I got over it as soon as I found out that Scarlet (a character in the second installment) has red hair, and she's a good guy!<br /><br />I took a risk reading this book. When I first heard about it, I was weary. I put it on my TBR list but it wasn't something I was going to be reading right away. Cinderella retellings are SO popular and with it being so science fiction-y, I wasn't sure I was going to like it. Even though two of my favorite shows ever are Sci-fi (Warehouse 13 and Eureka). I cannot stress to you how much I LOVED this book!! You should definitely at the very least give it a try. I'm so glad I did and now I'm going to go straight and read Scarlet and dive back into the wonderful world Marissa built!edheaded women.

B00498YZH8|5.0|I'm no expert, but I think Jennifer Lawrence must be a very good actress. I loved watching her. Are there really people like the ones in this movie?
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The writing is this book caused conflicting emotions that I sometimes didn't understand.  There are times that you want to hate Gideon because he's so mean, but the writing makes him sympathetic, so you love him anyway.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I love survival stories, Mad Max, post apocalyptic adventures -the cool guy beats all the bad guys. All good for me, but this one had an actual plot too!
B000O59A2K|5.0|If you love John Wayne movies like I do, you will like both of these movies.  Only draw back that I saw to Hatari was the girl did not fit John Wayne at all.  She would have been a better match for the love interest for Red Buttons in the movie.  Eldorado was a better movie than Hatari for John Wayne, and together, they make it worth having in your DVD Library.
0307352153|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't T Stop Talking by Susan Cain<br /><br />\\"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't T Stop Talking\\" is an enlightening book about introversion.  It's a wonderful book that covers interesting recent findings of introverts and extroverts.  Best-selling author Susan Cain, who once practiced corporate law, takes the reader on a fascinating ride into a world that surprisingly we know so little about, the world of an introvert.  This interesting 368-page book is broken out into the following four Parts: One: The Extrovert Ideal, Two: Your Biology, Your Self?, Three: Do All Cultures Have An Extrovert Ideal?, and Four: How to Love, How to Work.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. A well-written book on an interesting and the seldom addressed topic of introversion.<br />2. A well-researched book that immerses many and interesting studies skillfully into the narrative.<br />3. Cain has great command of a topic that is near and dear to her heart.  She is engaging and shares many of her personal insights without ever being the main focus.<br />4. Introverts rejoice...a book about you for a change!<br />5. Many figures achieved not in spite of but because of their introversion.<br />6. Throughout the book the author provides many characteristics regarding introverts and extroverts.  One of the great contributions of this book. \\"Still, today's psychologists tend to agree on several important points: for example, that introverts and extroverts differ in the level of outside stimulation that they need to function well. Introverts feel \\"just right\\" with less stimulation, as when they sip wine with a close friend, solve a crossword puzzle, or read a book. Extroverts enjoy the extra bang that comes from activities like meeting new people, skiing slippery slopes, and cranking up the stereo.\\"<br />7. The clarification of what the term introvert means, \\"A few things introverts are not: The word introvert is not a synonym for hermit or misanthrope. Introverts can be these things, but most are perfectly friendly.\\"<br />8. A self-esteem booster for introverts, \\"If there is only one insight you take away from this book, though, I hope it's a newfound sense of entitlement to be yourself.\\"<br />9. The author debunks many myths about introversion, \\"Contrary to the Harvard Business School model of vocal leadership, the ranks of effective CEOs turn out to be filled with introverts, including Charles Schwab; Bill Gates; Brenda Barnes, CEO of Sara Lee; and James Copeland, former CEO of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.\\" \\"The lesson, says Collins, is clear. We don't need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.\\"<br />10. Many great lessons, \\"To understand how to maximize these employees' contributions is an important tool for all leaders. It's also important for companies to groom listeners as well as talkers for leadership roles.\\"<br />11. Many great quotes, \\"I am a horse for a single harness, not cut out for tandem or teamwork ... for well I know that in order to attain any definite goal, it is imperative that one person do the thinking and the commanding.\\" By Albert Einstein.<br />12. Many great findings, \\"One of the most interesting findings, echoed by later studies, was that the more creative people tended to be socially poised introverts.\\"<br />13. Better business practices, \\"Some companies are starting to understand the value of silence and solitude, and are creating \\"flexible\\" open plans that offer a mix of solo workspaces, quiet zones, casual meeting areas, caf&eacute;s, reading rooms, computer hubs, and even \\"streets\\" where people can chat casually with each other without interrupting others' workflow.\\"<br />14. The important role biology plays in our temperaments. \\"Studies in humans have found that adolescent girls with the short allele of the SERT gene are 20 percent more likely to be depressed than long-allele girls whenexposed to stressful family environments, but 25 percent less likely to be depressed when raised in stable homes.\\"<br />15. An interesting discussion on what is considered to be our sweet spot, \\"Your sweet spot is the place where you're optimally stimulated.\\"<br />16.  Interesting findings on sensitivity, \\"The highly sensitive tend to be philosophical or spiritual in their orientation, rather than materialistic or hedonistic. They dislike small talk. They often describe themselves as creative or intuitive.\\"<br />17.  The basis of \\"buzz\\" and how it relates to introverts and extroverts, \\"Extroverts' dopamine pathways appear to be more active than those of introverts.\\"<br />18. Cultural differences.  \\"there's often a subtle way to get what you want. It's not always aggressive, but it can be very determined and very skillful. In the end, much is achieved because of it. Aggressive power beats you up; soft power wins you over.\\"<br />19. Identifying the three core personal projects.<br />20. The interesting communication gap between introverts and extroverts. \\"These findings suggest something very important: introverts like people they meet in friendly contexts; extroverts prefer those they compete with.\\"<br />21. A practical guide for teachers and parents.  \\"The key is to expose your child gradually to new situations and people--taking care to respect his limits, even when they seem extreme. This produces more-confident kids than either overprotection or pushing too hard.\\"<br />22. Excellent conclusion chapter that ties everything together.<br />23. Excellent supporting material.<br />24. Bibliography and notes.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The book does not link up.<br />2. The book lacks scientific depth.  The author purposely keeps the topics at a very basic and readable level.<br />3. The topic of free will lacks depth.<br /><br />In summary, I really enjoyed this book.  This was a fun and revealing book that quite frankly isn't covered much.  The book covers many fascinating stories and studies about introverts and it also debunks many myths.  It also plays the role of a self-guide book for parents and educators.  Most importantly Cain provides introverts with a much-needed self-esteem boost.  A fun book that is highly recommended!exposed to stressful family environments, but 25 percent less likely to be depressed when raised in stable homes.\\"<br />15.

1451695195|2.0|After seeing Dr. Alexander on television being interviewed, I couldn't wait to buy and read his book, having high hopes for any enlightenment it might bring about the afterlife.  Anxiously reading it, I found it disappointing and boring for the most part.  That being said, the book could only be as personal and interesting as the experience Dr. Alexander had.  I'm certain it must be helplessly impossible to put such an experience into accurately descriptive words since words, with their inherent limitations, are confining and inadequate.  Before having read it myself, I bought it as a gift to give to a relative of mine who is studying to be a minister.  But, after then reading it myself, I was regretful I gave it as that special gift..  She made no comment after reading it so I assumed she may have been disappointed as well.  So much for \\"Proof of Heaven.\\"  Unfortunately, I have to say I would not recommend it but respect and appreciate Dr. Alexander's NDE without pause and am grateful he lived to tell the rest of us about it.  I am not quite sure what I took away from it.  I don't believe we are meant to comprehend our existence in this realm until we die, and maybe not even then.
B00004YA66|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies someone stole my last copy i was so glad to find this one at such a great price. i love time traval movies and this fit that well also it is a great family feel good movie and i love dennis quade and jim kavesil

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had just gotten my kindle fire and found this while I was browsing.The graphic design is crafted to remarkable detail and you can care,feed and photograph your horse(of whom you can buy friends and change mane and tail color,).You can also make friends and visit their stables,give virtual gifts of money,but you do not text or communicate with them;making it child friendly.You can earn virtual coins and gems while caring and entering your horse in contests and must keep your horses health and happiness level to a certain requirement to enter them.I recommend it for ages eight through seventeen.

B002L7TMAE|4.0|This wont be a very in depth review but I wanted to let anybody who is familiar with Ms. Hardy's catalog what this is and why you may want it.<br />It appears that a great percentage of this set was remixed recently(ie. not in the sixties or seventies). There is a great deal of digital reverb which is out of character with the tunes as they were recorded in the sixties. The reverb which could have been tastefully used to emulate the rooms, springs, or plates of the era instead is sometimes terribly present and almost goofy sounding. The album that suffers most is The\\" Premier bon heur de jour\\" ? pardon my French. Some of the other albums range from tolerable to very good. A number of tunes appear in original mono which may be a blessing. This may be because the masters are gone or deteriorated. The oldest tapes seem to have fared the best. On some tunes at the top of an album side, the master tapes clearly show deterioration. Channels drop-out and pop back but, again, I am pleased that somebody tried. Hand the job over to someone like Steve Hoffman and these songs will really pop. The album with \\"Voila\\" -Ma Jeneusse ma fol camp \\" -pardon my French- is curiously missing. I thought it was her last Vogue disc before the Dutronc Era. hmmmmmmmmm. PACKAGING --The albums are mini cardboard reproductions in which the disc is nestled within yet another cardboard sleeve. The disc is TIGHT in the sleeve and may be warped.<br />First thing I did was ditch the innersleeves and slip the discs into something more comfortable.  The original packaging may very well damage the discs in time. The discs are cute black reproductions with tiny writing on white labels. A booklet in French is included.<br />The mastering on the discs is compressed like mad and really crispy for those with bad tweeters and a lot of ambient noise in their listening environment. This was mixed by somebody who wasn't at the original sessions.<br />This set creates the hope that this may be done again the rightway at some point
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|This  would be a fantastic story to ignite classroom and home discussions on human nature. The parallels between the world in this book and current global society are pointed and disturbing.There are many 'games' played here: survival, political, interpersonal. Even the so-called story 'flaws' and writing style are fodder for analysis. I think critics of the books in this trilogy have overlooked this and I like that the heroine is not the most noble or likeable of all the characters. The reality is  that leaders are rarely perfect. Be warned that although not super-graphic, the death and killing will likely disturb you and some young adults may need to debrief after reading it.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Great movie. This was a horse beyond compare. I watch the races for the triple crown when they were ran and this movie says it all. Diane Lane was wonderful, as usual.
B002TQKHIS|5.0|Bought this for the significant other...we both thoroughly enjoyed the music and the video!  A must see for McCartney fans!
1572816112|3.0|I bought these cards as a gift for my wife. She was very excited to have them as they had been sitting on her wish list forever, however once she received them she wasn't so happy. The images on the cards were a bit more disturbing that she had originally expected. Her tastes are generally dark and gothic in nature, so we both felt these would be a great addition to her already large tarot collect, but we were very wrong.<br /><br />While these cards are of high print quality, the colors look great, the artwork was well done and the paper weight is awesome, the images on the cards are not for the feint of heart. Probably not a recommended deck for someone doing readings for others in person on a professional level either as it could really put someone off (unless you are really going for the VooDoo look or some-such).
B001CW7MFQ|2.0|I bought this crap remaster back on July 5, 2012. I thought I should warn anyone else who's thinking about buying it. First, this remaster was done by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab. They've remastered countless records. This is the first remaster I've ever purchased from them. That being said, this wasn't a very good introduction to Mobile Fidelity because as stated before, this remaster is crap. I'll make this short and site the pros and cons in a bulleted list below:<br /><br />Pros: * Mobile Fidelity's remaster manages to bring out hidden pieces of the music that were kind of buried in the original recording.<br /><br />  * This remaster isn't part of the loudness wars. Mobile Fidelity didn't make it loud as hell, which was great. Most remasters now are increasing the volume more than the original recording, which isn't what a remaster should do. In fact, this remaster is even a tiny bit lower in volume than the original recording.<br /><br />Cons: * For some reason, Mobile Fidelity cut off the first few seconds of each and every song. What the hell? Seriously, no excuse for that at all. Oh, but wait, it gets worse!<br /><br />  * Mobile Fidelity took it upon themselves to raise the pitch of each and every song, too. Pretty bad, right? That's the final straw.<br /><br />So, there you have it. Don't waste your money on this. You're much better off (obviously) getting the original 1992 recording. One of the most horrible remasters I've ever had the displeasure of hearing, along with the remaster of Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\". Steer clear of this, people.

B0058DRUV6|4.0|Good to Great is outstanding in every respect - and had I read this book immediately after it was published, I would have strongly recommended 5 Stars. The principles outlined in the book are, almost certainly, enduring and timeless – making it still one of the best primers for starting new businesses or taking a business from good to great. However, the book suffers from its original publication date - which was well before the economic crisis that began in the late 2000's. As a result, one of the Good to Great companies lauded in the book turns out to be Fannie Mae and much of the &#34;innovative&#34; thinking that Fannie Mae used to become a 'great' company was ultimately responsible for its subsequent implosion. Nevertheless, many of the author's original conclusions about the company are probably still valid , and a revised edition that takes into account the difficult period we've experienced (and how all the Good to Great companies have fared) would be an exceptionally interesting read. Ultimately though, despite the need for a new edition, the book should be considered a “must buy” for anyone in senior management or looking to create a start-up that will have the legs to go the distance.

B0082PQ8KQ|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks reveals the story of a woman considered to be one of the most significant contributors to medical research. Her HeLa cells have been used for many studies ranging from the polio vaccine to cancer studies. But how much do we know about the woman?  I knew nothing about her and her family before I read this book. I never even knew that cells were taken from her without her knowledge.<br /><br />Skloot effectively constructs a narrative that shows the racial and social dynamics in play during Henrietta's life and the social tensions that still exist today between the medical community and vulnerable populations. The book also brings up issues related to consent and compensating for past wrongs. Despite the HeLa cells advancing science and creating opportunities for others, her family is left behind and missing from the arena of profit and medical gains.<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable read that explores how intimately racial, ethical, and social factors tie into medicine. It weaves together the life of a woman, her family, the scientific community, and an author curious enough to uncover the history of the prevalent HeLa cells.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|A impulsive pick, I like the author's previous novels. While I was reading, sometimes I thought the story was a bit tedious, yet interesting. I was completely caught off guard with the ending. Don't want to spoil it for possible readers, but it will give an entirely new, different perspective to the entire book. I love that...when you don't see the &#34;end&#34; coming. Yes, read and enjoy!

B008JFUO36|4.0|\\"Based on a graphic novel\\" means another comic book-based story. I'm sure you expect subtle nuances and sophisticated philosophizing, but.... In this dystopian setting (of course) we visit the ruins of well-known American landmarks as our hero is sent to finish the eradication of a few survivors who cling to the remnants of Earth after an interplanetary war. The moon has been destroyed and we see the effects of the resulting earthquakes, while aliens \\"farm\\" the remaining water. Computer Generated Imaging is used very effectively, although some of this was shot in Iceland, California, New York and Louisiana. The Empire State Building is a critical element.<br /><br />It is impossible to talk about the plot without revealing important points, so rather than do an entire review that is a spoiler, I'll stay pretty general.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Tom Cruise (\\"Jack Reacher\\" and \\"Rock of Ages\\") is more appealing than usual; this time he plays the stalwart soldier on assignment to \\"mop up\\" any survivors.<br />  * Morgan Freeman (\\"Olympus Has Fallen\\" and \\"Dolphin Tale\\"\\") is one of those survivors trying to avoid being \\"mopped up.\\"<br />  * Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (\\"Headhunters\\" and \\"Game of Thrones\\") is currently my favorite Danish actor. His character is another one of those survivors attempting to remain alive on Earth.<br />  * Andrea Riseborough (\\"Disconnect\\" and \\"W.E.\\") is our hero's partner, sharing that mop-up assignment.<br />  * Olga Kurylenko (\\"Quantum of Solace\\" and \\"Paris je t'aime\\") is the survivor of a crash, rescued by our hero.<br />  * Melissa Leo (\\"The Fighter\\" and \\"Flight\\") is the Commander's voice and face on the communications screen, issuing orders to our mop-up crew.<br /><br />Pay close attention to the plot, as it is satisfactorily complex. I liked one \\"sink hole\\" that turned out to be the ruins of the New York City Library. Please note that this cast has been assembled in keeping with Tom Cruise's international stardom. His movies are successfulthroughout the world and they keep his fans in mind when his movies are cast. This is a very good one for him.<br /><br />This is rated PG-13, so expect lots and lots of gunfire, no sweaty bodies, a couple of swear words and nudity only alluded to, but the crux of the story is a \\"mind-wipe\\" that erases memory, so pay close attention. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was very inspired by the author and very humbled. My trials are few compared to all she went through. I would highly recommend this book.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Interesting plot of the young man's coming to age and surviving on a life boat with a Bengal tiger.  Like Pi, I wished the tiger would have turned around and said goodby to him.<br />On a technical note , it did not download well and Amazon sent me an email saying they would refund my rental price; very nice I greatly appreciate that.<br />Thanks
B007R3AZNK|5.0|His recordings compliment the live performances he puts on. Love the blues and love the guitar. Joe Bonamassa is a virtuoso.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|this movie's cinematography is crap, everything is way too dark. and dude, when you see a box of movies with murders being committed strangely appear in your attic - call the cops moron.
B002YCVX5S|1.0|I can't thick of one things good to say about this movie.  One of my all tie worse movie experiences.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I really enjoyed The Martian a lot and read it in just a few days.  I have always been a fan of hard science fiction and this one was just very well executed.  It is very much &#34;Apollo 13 on steroids&#34;, same basic plot, except in this case the space mission having problems has only very brief contact with Earth and the protagonist must do it all himself.  At the end of the book, though, I was somewhat disappointed in the vast improbability that this guy could have survived at all with the challenges he faced.  For one, he was always cheerful and never seemed to have a bad day.  I think he did that by keeping busy (and you will read in great detail about what he did to keep busy), but the psychological effects of being in his situation would be horrendous and the author never even hinted at it.  Also, given the harshness of the environment, it is almost certain that some of the setbacks he faced would have killed him, so by the end I had kind of expect there to be an implausible solution to every inevitable problem.  Overall I enjoyed the book and thought it was a great story told pretty well.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|'very slow..................Great acting by D dAy Lewis.  Good account of history, but seemed to drag on.  Glad we ordered it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love this show and season four should not be missed.  Can't wait for season 5 and already have my pre-order in.  I have purchased all four seasons from Amazon and they have the best price plus free shipping.
B008YI91HS|5.0|My sons and I really like this movie. The dinosaurs are intense and really make you think about what they really are. The excitement and drama have you sitting on your seat. I love the raptors the most!
057809665X|5.0|A very short read, but well worth the investment.  Robin is an excellent public speaker and I have seen him in action with the techniques identified herein.  Very applicable if your business is dealing with people.
B003Y5USG4|4.0|It is awesome how they give perspective of the tornados and the drama of the love triangle is cool to follow along. Also really nice to be able to see how it was before the advance warning systems were invented
B002NT3B52|3.0|I was looking for more dog specifics in regards to our relationships with dogs.Well organized but lacks details and insight.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This movie was great because the graphics and the animation was off the charts! The drama and excitement really has you willing to follow through the whole movie and not bored! Great for me and the kids
B00336G7HI|5.0|I just bought a new Sony HD Camcorder and wanted to stick with an OEM battery.  I brought the battery with me on a cruise as a backup.  It lasted all day; 16 hours plus!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an amazing app you have to try it . and you can even have it read to you.  AMAZING APP
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is the best book ever written.  The author tells the story from the Alzheimer patient's view.  It is awesome.  Very hard to put down.  I have read all her books now and put her as my No. 1 favorite author.  I will read each of her books as they come out.
0316010669|5.0|Must read. Gladwell is a terrific writer and knows the subject matter. His research and insight is set out for the reader in plain English making a reader want to read more.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I gave this book two stars because Gillian Flynn can actually write -- she does keep your interest. (Although a few times she has Amy bragging about her grammar skills, but then goes on to use the wrong pronoun with a direct object! If you're going to brag about it -- do it right!)<br /><br />However, it is hard to recommend a book where the two main characters are sociopathic liars and the book doesn't even pretend to resolve. It feels like she wrote herself into a hole and then had to think of the most incredible coincidences -- that the ex-boyfriend was even more insane than Amy -- to get Amy where she had to be. Don't bother with this book. It does not live up to the hype and you will feel like you need to take a long, hot shower when you are finished.
B000022TSH|5.0|One of my all time favorite films to watch. For special features, the dvd has an interview with Polanski, the writer, and producer about how the film got started which was interesting to watch. 5/5
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter really likes this game. She is on it all the time. Good game if you like horses alot.
0399157565|2.0|The audio book is 10 discs.  The essential story could have been easily told on 2 discs. There was hour after hour of incessant detail as if there was a desire to impress the listener with the width and breath of the author's forensic and investigative knowledge.  We kept saying \\"I wish she would say something relevant to a non-professional's interest in the mystery. There is such depth at every turn that it certainly could be used as an idea book if not a text in forensic investigation.  But, even for the scientific minded reader, it was maddening to hear what-if's and maybe's and detail essentially unrelated to the mainstream of the investigation. All in all, the most boring book we have ever listened to on a driving trip, and there have been several.
0553385445|5.0|the book is awesome, show all the missing parts in the first book, i read it twice in a row
B00004WNFZ|1.0|I bought this record in March 2013. It is one of my all-time favorites. Unfortunately, the album arrived with skips on side 2. I've ordered and returned this same item previously, but a couple years have passed since my first purchase, which was returned for the exact same reason. It is possible that the master copy from which this pressing is being burned is damaged. Otherwise I would rate the product 5 stars.
B007MGWBU2|2.0|Have always loved the Muppets and looked forward to be reunited with old time favorites. Maybe we've grown up, or maybe the movie left us disappointed.  Not the usual, classic Muppet entertainment.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My niece loves this game. She is all about her horse that lives in the kindle. Soon she will have a couple of horses to care for.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I had this book on my to read list for a while.  Then I picked up Walking disaster. Well I couldn't read the one without reading the other so I bought both.  I enjoyed reading it.  Yeah if you look at it from the view of- I can't believe she fell in love with the guy while he was acting like a slit and o overlooked his b.s. it would have been bad. However I didn't. I was drawn into their story from their point of view.  I am very anxious to read his side in Walking Disaster.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|At the risk of having to turn in my man card, I shall review... The people that would appreciate the musical side of LM will be disappointed by the non-professional singing. The people who watch the movie because of the cast are going to be disappointed that the movie is 99.8% singing. The rest will like it because their hopes were so high that they refuse to believe it was really that bad of a movie (pure denial). That is all...
B00BG08FKK|5.0|My niece is about to make her debut as Fantine, which is why I am interested in hearing the movie sound-track. It is excellent.
B00008PX8P|5.0|it is awesome a must have for any Zepplin fan. bought it as a gift for my boyfriend he loved it
B009FZFONO|2.0|This show started out great, but has devolved into a melodramatic, intellectually vacant suck-fest.  The writing has gone seriously downhill, and the show plods along at a ridiculous pace.  Oh and by the way, who cares about the zombies anymore?  They're not even taken seriously at this point.  The finale of the 3rd season was so god awful that I don't know if I can even bring myself to give the 4th season a chance.<br />Read the graphic novel instead.  Or, if you want a real show, with great acting and incredible script work, and run by people who understand pacing, climax, subtlety, flare, and dramatis, watch Game of Thrones.  Not this drivel.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|The movie lacks a lot of the motivation that the first three have.  While it ties in nicely, this movie shows viewers they could have done the first three in one.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I loved this movie, I watched this while video streaming on amazon.  This was great.  Love Matthew McConaughey in this movie.
B00B2QA646|4.0|I thought this film was an absolutely excellent Brechtian view of Tolstoy's classic. The reminder that this is a piece of fiction through the convention of the \\"behind the scenes\\" theatrical shots were positively genius.
B00AGKHEUI|4.0|Very nice.  what a nice musical  memory the songs of a Great band in the 80's Get it if you want the sound you grew up with.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this app so much fun to play! It keeps you entertained and busy when there is nothing to do :)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|this movie is as beautiful and well acted as the Lord of the rings, the chartacters are outstanding and full of great personalities.<br />Nothing better than Tolkien. But it helps when the acters are Brillant!
B0060D3BWK|5.0|I've been wanting to get this movie for A very long time, I watch it every year, at Halloween time, but, it's filled with commercials<br />NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Bought it because it received good reviews. I did not like the movie very much. Maybe should have read the book first.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I've seen the movie 5-6 times now, I know most of the songs by heart, this soundtrack is now on my MP3 player, and my computer, should that fail, it's on ,my portable hard drive too
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I hesitated to view this film because I couldn't conceive of it being as good as the Ring Triology. I was WRONG this is just as  good. The videography, the scenery, the music, the story (yes, I've read the book), and the characters and acting all drew me in. I can barely wait for more!!
B0001I55OC|4.0|I saw Rossif Sutherland acting alongside his Dad, in The Con Artist, he had more lines in the Con Artist, this film, he portrays A \\"French\\" translator, his lines were few the ending credits were bad, I had to go online HERE, to find out the cast and crew
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It was very interesting and creepy in most parts. This movie is not only horror, it is also a mystery and a thriller.  You will not regret watching this. I'm glad I bought it for sure.
B00AO686MY|4.0|Who framed Roger Rabbit is an exercise of something that had already been done competently both by Disney (where is Song of the south, by the way?) and MGM's Hanna and Barbera.<br /><br />I am glad that the Roger Rabbit shorts have made it to the Blu-Ray disc in pristine condition, and truly sorry that others were never made. Frankly, I like those shorts much better than the feature. It reminds us the magnitude of Tex Avery's contributions to American cartoons, in their best production period.
B005HJWWW8|1.0|it does no not work. It did not work out the box. I plug iit in  and nothing and it was on.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Many years ago I had the chance to attend a seminar about restoration given one of his later cinematographers, Gary Graver. On that particular occasion Warner had already released the DVD collector edition of this film, and he said that the transfer was wrong, with an absurd emphasis on contrast, exposing things that should not be seen.<br /><br />Be as it may, the fact is that this DVD transfer is indeed quite different from that of this Blu-Ray edition. I found the latter much closer to the theatrical presentation, and may be a strong evidence that Mr. Graver was right.<br /><br />What, on the other hand, I do miss in the box is the excellent BBC documentary titled The Complete Citizen Kane, aired in the early 1990's. And apparently this documentary has not been available elsewhere.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It takes some nice and clear pictures,  Works fine and I enjoy how handy it is.  Thank you for helping me choose the right one
B003KUSUN6|5.0|Superb! Video and audio are great, especially considering this concert was in 2004. I had only heard about The Shadows until I bought the disc. It's really too bad the Shadows weren't promoted in the US: their music is really, really good. This one of the few concerts where the live versions of the songs are better than the originals. Buy it.....
B001CDZZI6|3.0|I read part of the book before I took the assessment.  I was surprised that characteristics that I attributed to myself did not show in the top five in the &#34;included report&#34;.  I was looking for some verbs to help with resume writing.  This book was not helpful.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I had to see it after all the buzz and everyone going on about how wonderful it was.  I thought is was just okay and could hardly stay awake through the whole thing.  I usually love period piece movies but this one was a long story about amending the constitution before the civil war ended.  It almost made me feel the north was a bit underhanded in the whole abolishment of slavery - maybe that is reading too much into this movie.  I did take away some sense of how far we have come as a nation, ending slavery, segregation, allowing women to vote and it reminds me that we are still dealing with civil rights today with the gay marriage issues.  Who knows what generations down the road will think of us and our backwards thinking.<br /><br />Anyway, if you are a history buff or a person that likes loads if dialogue about one subject then rush to see this one.  I am just waiting for the next star trek to be released.<br /><br />Oh and was Sally Field so wrong in this movie? Love her, but did not like her in this role.  Oh well, just my opinion!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am not usually a card player, but I enjoy this one! Fast paced or easy pace you decide. Either way it is a good game.
B007IK44CK|4.0|this film was action packed.  Even though parts of the movie were not believable, it was a very entertaining movie
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast paced, intriguing, and eminently believable, this warrants the label &#34;page turner.&#34; It's like a game of pool where you're trying to think two shots ahead. Grisham's protagonist is playing the angles so the reader is constantly trying to peer around the corner for the next twist with him.<br /><br />Although fiction, I, as a former federal attorney, find his depiction of &#34;the Feds&#34; accurate in their appearance, perspective, and motivations. It's his best recent book, although I've read and enjoyed virtually all of his novels.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I love sci-fi movies,it seems connected to Alien series,they were great! Very good special effects. Great story line that is set in outer space,in another time!!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A nice story, in a pretty location, with lots of pretty people and funny dialog. For fans of romantic comedy, you won't be disappointed.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Bond seemed more thoughtful and real in this movie.  It made the movie more interesting and fulfilling as a watching experience.
B00699SDR8|5.0|Important read for both adults and children. I couldn't put this one down, and I feel like this should be mandatory reading at high schools.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|OK to begin with it's Jimi,,, so purchasing it was a no brainer.  This is a great compilation of &#34;found&#34; works and endorsed by the Hendrix Family How much more do you need to know,  BUY THIS
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Not as good as first book. The last few paragraphs become exciting again. Looking forward to book 3. A turn at end of book 2 brought my interest back.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|highly recommend this CD.  If you true fan of &#34;hard hard&#34; rock this is the CD for you.  Part 1 is killer loved it.... have not as yet listened to Part 2 but would not have purchased it if I had not been impressed with Part 1
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am a solitaire junky and love to play it everyday. I usually just use the random deal, because that is what I grew up on. Some day will have to connect to the net and try some other versions.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|this book , for me, brought to life the history of the southrn part of Great Britian.<br />the historical connectivity by family generations was as fresh for me as I felt it was in &#34;Russka&#34;, which I read first.<br />that feeling waned as I read my third Rutherford book &#34;London&#34; where that method actually became annoying to me.<br />maybe if I read the books in a different order I would have a different opinion.
B00065F86U|5.0|Not much that can go wrong, I bought it to use with my D300 nikon, no issues but it's not like it gets banged around or any rough handling.
0823015033|5.0|I have bought several books on polymer clay. This one taught me just what I needed to know to fix a problem I had with figures- how to mix clays that would look more natural and have no blotches when baked. It also teaches how to construct the figures to reach a more professional and artistic position. I'm grateful to have this teaching tool..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my little daughter loves horses and since we cannot have a real one,  this is perfect and she is very happy with this app!
B0020M99LC|5.0|Watched this movie with a new sound system and it was fantastic. Great action movie!  Will definitely watch it again!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|except for the ending, i loved this book.  love the way mr. ford writes.  and this tale was very gripping.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This movie turned out to be better than I though it would. I tried to read the book but just couldn't get into it.  The movie did a good job of bringing that world to life.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|Was introduced to Bonobo, via Black Sands, which I loved. This album is equally as good. Highly recommend it. Love it.
1419701533|5.0|My grandson loved these books and it was perfect because there was so many in the gift set he could read and enjoy.
B00821OX98|4.0|Very creative series with good actors.  I really like the series, I just get a bit annoyed at the dumb decisions made in tough situations. Common sense is over looked by the writers...
0061452068|5.0|As an investor in the equities market I am always looking to make the rational decision. With  negative news constantly bombarding you and creating an emotional upheaval, it is very important to keep a long term perspective. In the terms of Tennis analogies I prefer to make the least number of unforced errors due to nervousness and euphoria with the wild market swings.<br />This book gives the mind a new direction to think and helps in forcing you to think rationally. Is the climate changing, or are we getting unreasonably worried by short term whether patterns?<br />Matt Ridley forced me to analyze the situation on a longer term perspective. I discovered that the best decisions are made when you are in a stable emotional state of mind.<br />I would highly recommend this book to the newbie investors, worried about their small nest egg, that they have invested in the markets.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|As a senior citizen when I first started reading this book....&#34;I thought this can't be a book I'll like?&#34;  I truly enjoyed it!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|love everything for the lord of the rings and this movie is just amazing.. will buy the other two movies to..
B0084IHVGG|4.0|If you love cats or just plain Disney movies then you've got to buy this movie. It is just simply adorable!!!
B000B8QG4A|5.0|You can't go wrong with a Disney and Lady and The Tramp was one of the best. Love the dogs and the cats (Even though their bad) all the animal hijinks are priceless and your kids are going to love it!
0061673730|5.0|Excellent book with extremely fast and friendly service. A very interesting book that is quite unlike any other. I highly recommend purchasing this item.
B000FA675C|5.0|The movie was very good, but the book was excellent.  Even if you saw the movie, it is more than worthwhile to read the book.
B00A4A1KK0|5.0|Love Phillip Phillips!  Love the album!<br />If you thought he was good in idol you will really enjoy this - what a great vocalist.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was perfection. It seems incredible that this came from a novice writer who self-published - it's so clean and tight. The characters are deep, the story unique, the right amount of action and inaction. This is a book that stuck with me; I think about it often. I can't wait to read the follow=ups!
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|I wasn't even a Bieber fan... AT ALL!! I usually listen to rap music lol. Then I was falling asleep one night and they played a commercial with him singing and I was like ohhhhhhhh I must have this cd. Love Love Love it!!!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I was completely enamored of this book at first, even with the BLATANT Twilight similarities. I loved the story line while they were still at Oxford, where Ashmole 782 was the only mystery. Then there was just so much (too much) going on. Still an enjoyable read but way too long and way too much!
B007DIQC90|5.0|An Iceland unsigned and unknown band wins battle of the bands. Then they release this masterpiece; For their first album.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is unique. I loved the varying points of view, and how the book came full circle at the end. There were lots of little things about it that made it great; a thoroughly entertaining read and look at a post-apocalyptic future!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was a super film. While it differed slightly from the books (ok, a bit more then slightly) it is still a wonderful adaptation of the novels. Fantastic special effects, great acting, and an epic story really make John Carter stand out in a sea of mediocre sci-fi films. I highly recommend this film to all those who love high adventure and imagination.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I was sorry when it ended. Underrated by the Academy. Everyone in the cast was excellent. Russel Crowe was a much better singer than critics led me to believe.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|It got to my house in good time and I enjoyed the bonus features.  The audio commentary was a good addition.
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|Keeps my attention and makes me want to see what is going to happen next.  I liked it and think you would too.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|After not seeing the film in a long time it was nice to be remembered of the first film Walt made.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|one of the best games ive ever played only thing is ive been. playing only for to months and ive done every thing so in the next update can you add more types of bloons or add more tower please?!?!?thank you!!
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|This movie is classic Clint Eastwood. Some spots are a little slow, but my husband and I enjoyed watching Mr. Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Gene Hackman. The scenery is stunning and the shoot 'em up action is pure Eastwood. Worth an evening.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I did not see this when it first came or but wanted to for awhile I just never got around to it. I finally did and did enjoy it.it's not ET by a wide margin but was very entertaining. I did not realize Jane Lynch was in this film. I really enjoy her character acting so was thrilled to see her in this and she was funny as ever. I would recommend this film to anyone.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater when it came out it 2009, and purchased it through Amazon Prime to watch again before the next movie comes out.  We all enjoyed our second viewing of this, and were able to introduce our 22 year old niece to Star Trek!  She enjoyed it, too, and we are all looking forward to seeing the new Star Trek!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Good read, but predictable.  Book was okay, but wont see the movie. Kind of a fluff book if you want something to take up time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed watching this while recuperating at home...it was nice to be able to watch the episodes back to back.  Worth watching.
B005VR9328|2.0|The Other Side is the best song on this album & it's just OK. What's w/the Roots making these depressing, suicidal sounding albums lately?  The classical snippets @ the end are the only somewhat upbeat tracks on this album.
0307744434|5.0|You will love this book.  You will not want to put it down, but go slowly and savor every word and image.  Let yourself go into the world of the Night Circus.  Beautiful story and wonderful characters.
B0071U3KCW|1.0|They sold consumers on the glories of Blu Ray and once on board we get ourselves subjected to flawed transfers.  It's frustrating to see its remarkable possibilites only to have it fall short with its mood killing interferences of Saul Bass's opening credits design fading in and out.  And why on earth would they ignore the Blu Ray inclusion of the recently discovered 6 track stereo design?  The final product is damnable as so much of its improvements are impressive but, ultimately, unfullfilled.  When you buy a Rolls Royce the anticipations are high and no one wants to get behind the wheel only to find that some of the fixtures and carpeting are missing.  People who don't understand their film history should be prevented from overseeing these eventful transfers.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I downloaded this and it does not work. A message is coming up telling me that content is unable to load at this time. What a waste of time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|None of the criticisms about masochism and sadism I heard about. The book involves romance, relationship and changing. Loved it and recommend to everybody.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|The Movie Is Not About Lincoln. It is about Amendment 13 to the constitution. Should of been documentary. Very disappointing. I love Daniel Day-Lewis and his movies, but this is not &#34;My left foot&#34;.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I have all the Marvel DVDs leading up to this.  I don't see how they can out do this one.  Just fantastic!
B008AYCSE4|5.0|I Love the movie, it is in great shape and came very quick! I was very pleased with this purchase!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Stories are organized as they where written.  This has been a please to read.  Only thing better would be to talk to Holmes or Watson personally.

034580404X|5.0|As a novice writer looking forward to a published novel one day.  I bought Fifty Shades Trilogy on a whim; more curiosity.  I am so glad I purchased it; I did not put it down.  I read all three books in seven days.  It was not just the erotic romance that makes the story, it was the intrigue, drama and that love shared between the two characters Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.  I am now reading it a third time being sure I didn't miss anything being the first two times it was a fast read.  I am now waiting for the movie to be released.  Thumbs up to E.L. James, she is an unbelievable author.  Good job well done, and thank you for sharing that imagination..

B007QNRMUU|5.0|Easy on the ears, laid back ,and yet some good commentary on relationships.  Some really funky, tight harmonies on a few songs.
B004FM2FFW|5.0|'Indig&egrave;nes' (DAYS OF GLORY) as written by Olivier Lorelle and Rachid Bouchareb (who also directed) is a film of visceral power, another aspect of World War II that has not been addressed and that points to problems of inequality among fighting troops that still exists. It is a grisly film (how can a film about war not be?) but shares a viewpoint that is as shocking as it is important.<br /><br />During WW II the French military incorporated African men including a large number of Algerian soldiers to fight the Nazis and protect France (and, yes, its protectorates) from oppression. The story focuses on four of these Algerian soldiers who leave their homeland to fight for the ideals of France yet are victims of discrimination and inequality of treatment and advancement, even when they are selected to perform the most hazardous of duties. The men vary from idealist to illiterate but their sense of camaraderie is rock solid: Saïd Otmari (Jamel Debbouze) is unable to read or write and has only one arm, yet he is devoted to his mission of saving France and hence his family in Algeria; Yassir (Samy Naceri) proves to be a marksman and is the one selected to be front man during the most dangerous encounters; Messaoud Souni (Roschdy Zem) finds solace in the love of a French girl Ir&egrave;ne (Aur&eacute;lie Eltvedt) but his communications with her are censured by the military; Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila) is the natural leader among the four yet is not advanced in rank when the Frenchmen are. The only non-Algerian who is supportive of these men is Sergeant Roger Martinez (Bernard Blancan) who attempts intervention with the French over the disillusioned Algerians. In many ways the story is related through the reactions of Abdelkader, especially the heartbreaking ending.<br /><br />It is the final act of courage when these four men are assigned to assist the American forces in Alsace, an assignment so devastatingly dangerous that no other French forces would accept, that the love and devotion of these men is supremely tested. And as the fragile victory over the Nazis is claimed by the French, we see the last of the Algerian quartet walk unnoticed and uncelebrated through the freed Alsatian town. If the 60 years later ending of the film is a bit maudlin for some viewers, it still makes a solid statement about the courage of these men, fighting for a 'motherland' that all but ignored them. And the story is true!<br /><br />The battle scenes are realistic, the acting is first caliber, and the production values are excellent, including the cinematography by Patrick Blossier and a musical score by Armand Amar and Cheb Khaled that enhances every aspect of a multicultural war. This is a film about WW II that stands with the best of the stories about the physical and emotional atrocities that war produces. In French and Arabic with subtitles. Highly recommended.

B005LAIIJY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has a style that is stylish!  Few can outdo him for over the top blood and guts treatment of a subject matter that is inherently not funny.  He knows how far he can push the limits and gathers together some very fine talent in all aspects of his creation. DJANGO UNCHAINED is certainly one of his finest efforts to date, and that is saying a lot. But a writer/director who can tackle a subject as heinous as our history of slavery and show all aspects of it - as vicious and cruel and inhuman as it was - while at the same time pepper it with outlandish parody and humor is a genius of cinema.<br /><br />Everyone knows the story of the film by now so a very brief statement is for openers: The time is two years before the Civil War and slavery is big business in America. Former dentist, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz who is actually the star of the film in a brilliant portrayal), buys the freedom of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx), and trains him with the intent to make him his deputy bounty hunter. Instead, he is led to the site of Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is owned by the smarmiest of villains Calvin Candie (Leonardo Di Caprio in an astonishingly fine turn out of his usual character), a ruthless plantation owner. How we get to Candyland via taking advantage of bounty hunter murders and money and finally arrive in the gross estate of Candie run by his own black master Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson in a brilliant cameo) in order to free Django's wife in a wily manner may take almost three hours but there is never a portion that is dull or that fails to introduce new highlights to the story.<br /><br />In addition to the `main characters' this film abounds in spectacular cameos by such fine actors as Don Johnson, Franco Nero, James Remar, Walton Goggins, Dennis Christopher, Ato Essandoh, Sammi Rotibi, Russ Tamblyn (yes, that one!), Bruce Dern, James Russo, Michael Parks, John Jarratt, among many others,  and of course Quentin Tarantino himself. There are scenes such as a gathering of a Western KKK gang with maladaptive hoods that are incredibly hilarious, and scenes of torture and violent blood-gushing shootouts.  It all works and even for the easily offended this is a film that entertains while it reminds us of a period in our history which is unutterably shameful. Grady Harp, April 13mself.

B002C6A6FY|5.0|I love this movie. I bought it for my collection and watch it over and over.  Two of my all  time favorite actors are at their very best in this flim.
B0091W0JPE|5.0|Great movie.  One of the classics.  Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart at their best.  Love the patriotic message of the movie as well as the romance.  I recommend it to everyone.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Tally and Shay and The Smokies make a great combo in the fight against the prettiest! I can't wait to see what happens next!
B00138KE5Y|5.0|If you like Streisand & love songs, this is for you. Packed with all her Duets, some I didn't know she had done.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|It follows the book quite well and fills in some blanks that really make the movie much better. I can't wait for #2 and #3.
B008ULM7HK|5.0|I enjoyed all songs from this collection cd, and the extended remixes that are hard to find are included in the collection, great for those who love Alyson vocals.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  The pace was very fast, couple of great surprises.  It was my first Lee Childs book and I found the Jack Reacher character to be the man of my dreams...just the kind of person I'd want on my side if I was in trouble.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love all these movies. Good to see how the journey began!  I would recommend this movie if you enjoyed the others.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I wanted to hire a hit man to kill this SOB after torturing him for 18 years, every day.  Who the hell does he think he is?  Kidnapping a child and doing unspeakable things to her - just because he wanted to.  You can tell this was not written by a professional but it's a wonderfully sweet book.  I can see how she survived this nightmare and came out the other side with her soul intact.  She's a remarkable young woman and I hope she's proud of herself.  The rest of us sure are!
B0018RC7QE|3.0|These two were cute in this but it was slow and not very engaging. Not a bad movie but just cute.
B001NHNG64|2.0|Child has become a formula writer.  Drama, bridge, girl, bridge, lose girl, get girl back, bridge, wrap.  I'm no longer interested the the Reacher series - especially since he chose Tom Cruise to play Jack in the movie.  Cruise is not able to pull this part off.  He doesn't have the physical presence of Jack Reacher.  He's too short, too small.  The selection of Tom Cruise was all about money.  Speaks volumes.  I'm finished with this series.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  The story is about courage and cunning and is clearly designed for a sequel.  It was time well spent.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|You really have to concentrate on this one.  The twists and surprises will lose you if you don't pay attention.  Great read though.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|This is 40 was very funny during certain scenes but other scenes the jokes seem forgettable. I think this movie was too long just like Apatows Funny people. I would recommend the movie as a rental. The story is relatable but also forgettable.

B008B1BL4E|4.0|Many of us were taught in school that the Great War was begun simply because of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in June 1914 by some radical. But that act was merely the spark that caused the pre-existing tinder to catch fire and leading to a general conflagration. This tinder and then the kindling, etc., were laid by a fairly large number of personages from Austria-Hungary, Russia, Germany, France, Britain and yes, the Balkans. What I liked most about this book are the character sketches of these key actors and their motivations, biases, qualities and flaws . . . . and how they all contributed to the coming WW I catastrophe. After all, history made in the actions of people.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|A must read! This book is very suspenseful and takes you on several twists and turns until the very end.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Best book I have read in my life my favorite  was scare crow ranked 5 stars  because the best book
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was great. I really enjoyed them, and though some people were saying the book were poorly written, I 100% disagree.
1591841666|2.0|Author seems to have nothing left to say. To speakers. Like reading Alice in wonderland and having conversation with the mad matter. Lacks clarity.
B001NKI60W|5.0|For those of us who enjoy the music of ABBA, this is the film to see!  The story which is told is entertaining and musical.  It is the DVD to add to your collection.

B00AAQVSDW|4.0|It's not my favorite country album, but it's definately a good one!  There's probably only one song on the whole album I do not love, but I can tolerate it.  I can listen to the whole album in one sitting and not get bored!  Great job on this one guys!
0385347774|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but it was a little over the top! Too many unbelievable twist & turns.
6305837325|5.0|i loved the scenes and the music, especially how the ocean sound was true and not overcome by the music sound.<br />i am hot happy with the company, because i tried to change addresses and maybe that is amazons fault not theirs.<br />but i was told by amazon to send an email, i did twice and NEVER received any reply. However the item came faster than they said so that was better. my friend has terminal cancer, her one wish was to come to the ocean, she lives in NM, and i then had to mail it on to her. But she still got it in time to hear it and see it<br />.there is some distortion in the viewing, at points more than others but i bought 2 one for me and one for her and we both love it.
B007X4N0DU|1.0|I did not expect this CD to have a song with several f-bombs. It is in bad taste. Also, many of the songs are remakes of their prior songs. Can I get a refund? I never opened it but downloaded it from Amazon player.
B002RVCD6O|5.0|great movie, brought the books to life in a magical way.  very entertaining for the entire family and kept everyone in suspense.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|We own a video store in the mountains, most all our videos come from Walmart, (best price). For some reason Walmart decided not to carry this movie.  Who knows where Walmart's brain is, let's plaster Milly Sirus everywhere, but we won't sell Lotto tickets.  Let's sell beer and wine but, not sell lotto tickets, Let's sell ammo but not sell guns, let's take the utility knife blades off the shelf so people won't steal them and open packages in other parts of the store, but not stop anyone from carrying a pocket knife into the store and do the same thing.  OK, I'm over my Walmart rant.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|kids loved the movie and it was entertaining for adults as well....great comic moments and entertainment. Highly recommend for children and families
B00499S9YC|5.0|What more can I say about this iconic band. They have been together for decades and have stayed together where a lot of bands of gone their separate ways. I could never get enough of their music. Timeless classics tat will always be in my mind and heart.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|&#34;If the earth had an anus, it would be located in Yemen.&#34; He's at it again. John Corey is wise cracking his way through life and trying to catch a bad guy in the process. This time, he and his lovely wife Kate Mayfield are playing a cat and mouse game in the Middle East. The objective is to lure The Panther, a home-grown Al-Qaeda terrorist with family ties to Yemen, into hunting them down to avenge the death of The Lion.<br /><br />Kate's boss dreamed up this idea. And if things work out right, it's supposed to be a turn around game, where the hunter is about to get captured by the game. But things never go as smoothly as planned. In the process, you get to learn a lot about a place you'll never go--Yemen. Experience a thrill ride with a world-class maniac--Corey. And wonder why more bad guys couldn't meet the fate of The Panther rather than ending up with three hots and a cot for life.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Love JT. This album was long over due. I love the harmonious and old school R&B vibe. A must for anyone's collection.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|I like her music and I was blown away from this album songs.  She is a great singer and I love her &#34;Oh Santa&#34; song letter -bring my baby home as my wish for this Christmas night. Her Christmas songs are very hip hop, I just love it.
B00899F0G8|4.0|This is a good show, but the storyline is getting a little stale.  I would love to see the story expanded.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The graphics are amazing!  I love the wizard of oz so I had to get it. It is challenging! The tornado is so cool!  Also the balloon ride is great ! The only thing I would like to see are more areas to explore.  Right now you only have the forests.

B00BESJYAY|4.0|This is the feeling you get at time, the waves are enormous ,scary but an exciting movie for surfers, also the courage of Jay versus the other aimless boys was a wonderful example for my 16 years old grandson, we enjoyed the movie together.

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Rented this to watch with my niece after finding out her DVD of this movie had issues and would not play in my player.  She enjoys watching this movie over and over and over again.
B0038P59A0|5.0|When I watched the 1st of the 2 Holmes movies (this one) a year or so ago, I wasn't that impressed.  It wasn't bad but I just didn't think it was awesome either.  i love mystery and action and so ti was well worth the first watch but I didn't think I would watch it again.  However, my 2 sons talked me into watching it a second time a few days ago (about a year later) and I realized this time, just how well done that movie was.  It was classic Holmes with a new twist, plenty of action, charisma, and mystery and well worth the watch a second time.  So we decided a few days later to watch the 2nd one in the series called &#34;Game of Shadows&#34; and it was Awesome (even better than the 1st).  Downey is perfect for the part because he can play the brain while adding a unique flare of being extremely eccentric.  Watson was also well played but I don't know the actors names.
B008XBASVY|4.0|This book is made up of Carson Phillips' journal entries, some newspaper articles and a literary journal to tell the story.  Carson's darkly sarcastic voice is very entertaining and so funny, as he tries his hardest to make something of his life despite what sounds like the worst high school in existence.  Teenage angst and prejudice and cruelty is very much in evidence, but Carson's lighting wit tears through the superficial layers of the characters and reveals a lot of heart in even the most unlikable characters.  Although Carson is the hero of the story, he has his flaws as well, and although it does seem justified compared to the flaws of his fellow classmates, it grounds the story by making it feel like a realistic study in character.<br /><br />The story is mostly character-driven, because it is about Carson's underhanded efforts to get into Northwestern University, and how he uncovers the secrets of some of his popular fellow students, and Carson is the one who really carries the story.  Don't expect alot of plot or even many twists and turns (except for the secrets the students are hiding).  The only thing I had trouble with was the ending, which seemed so unexpected and I found it hard to understand why it had to end that way.  But I know this is a personal preference, and it really doesn't change how very enjoyable I found the whole of the story.
B004FQX59I|5.0|The film is obviously among the finest of movies created, not only for the subject matter, which is very close to every American's heart but also because of the level of professionalism and quality with which it was made.

B008OOYALE|5.0|Love it. Both my sister and I have it. And have been playing the game for quite some time now. I also like how I don't have to buy gold for every little thing in the game too.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|My 6, 8, 10 yr old boys love love this game. They get home from school and check on their dinosaurs. They have to save up, plan ahead and budget. Its a great game and I must admit I too am mildly obsessed with it and will surprise my kids by checking in all day and earning coins for them to spend. Be prepared to get addicted. The higher levels tend to lock up more but easily restarted or a slight pause and it fixes itself.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This was the most boring show I have ever seen.  What a waste of time and money!!!!  And it was 3 hours long, couldn't make it the first 30 minutes.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds and still a fan favorite has gotten a bit long in the tooth but remains highly addictive and fun to play . This version is free and includes the occasionally annoying ads and pop ups asking you to buy now and so forth but if you can cope with that then save yourself a buck and get to flinging these lil' fella's all about !
B002LFPAUC|5.0|If you work in the hospitality industry, you will especially enjoy this!  You wish you could treat the guests the way John does.  But enjoyable non-the less. I watched these years ago on public television and still had to buy it!  You can watch these over and over!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Birds so you ( again ) know it's good , fifty bazillion downloads can't be wrong ! lol This game has seemingly endless upgrades and updates so you'll almost never run out of things to play earn and explore with in this version .
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I always loved AH - he is one of the best character actors of all time - they say he goes into the character and does not come out until the movie is complete -- I just love it - he can play any role and you forget he is AH and you just see his character
B007N5YIUS|5.0|You know is an automatic winner ! This version ( SPACE ) now forces you to take into consideration gravity and rotational forces which an added fun factor for a fresh new twist on this otherwise re-hash of the game
B003PM5Y4M|4.0|Typical Ben Stiller-style flick with craziness in every scene. Jack Black is a riot, Robert Downey Jr. as a black man is hilarious, and Tom Cruise as a fat movie mogul takes the cake.<br /><br />Don't expect anything amazing, but taken with a grain of salt this flick is a quotable gem.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Simply presented by a master wordsmith. A basic tale taken to the peek of presentation. No actor matches the book, but some do come close. (Patrick Stewart)
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I have been craving more music (old or new) from this extraordinary musician and this is it!!!!  I have volumes of music from Stills and others with him (Crosby, Nash, etc) and this adds to that collection.  Nash did a great job in putting this together and completes the CSN box sets!!!!  It is a must have for Stills fans.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works ok on my HTC phone. Haven't had any problems reading any of the books so far. Have not managed to grasp the coordination between my Kindle and the app as far a syncing them goes, but that could be me.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book.  It was suspenseful throughout and kept me reading any chance I got so that I could find out what was going to happen next :-)
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Excellent assemblege of classic stories of detection. The newer movies catch the spirit of adventure while the older ones display the thinking man to best advantage. This should be required reading to watch the movies though.
B001P5VT5O|5.0|I had all these albums at one time on cassette but it was time to upgrade them to cd. They are perfect and i like the packaging too. They arrived in perfect shape and quicker then they were supposed to be here. Lots of good music in this collection.

B007MB5OCE|5.0|I was drawn to this story by the intriguing title. It's full of humor and dry wit. Alan's look on life is something that, if more people thought that way, would make the world a better place. Through seemingly impossible scenarios Alan makes his way around the world in unwittingly controls some of the major events of the 20th century.  While there were parts, when reading I would think that there is no way this would actually happen, I was interesting to seen the author unfold the story and weave past and present events together. This is a Swedish book translated into English. I only hope that if this is made into a movie that the Swedish filmmakers direct it originally and Hollywood stays away.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this show. Cumberpatch and Freeman are the best Sherlock and Watson to date. I really enjoy how Sherlocks thoughts are conveyed through everything but thought bubbles.
1608871088|5.0|This is one of those artbooks where you just feel how much work went into it.  The art is stunning and it's great to see the characters in such a variety of styles.  On top of that, the notes and history of each character is an interesting read.  I also love how the book doesn't just go into the guardians, it also touches on Pitch and the children (Jamie and his friends).  There's even a section that goes through Jamie's home town.  Besides owning the novels, I'd recommend owning this too.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Was totally unaware of Rodriquez' existence until I saw the movie. It is a well done documentary that combines apartheid, music, and the nobility of manual labor, all wrapped in a mystery. Add to that his exceptional music, the doggedness of true fans, and a kind of peculiar success story — it's a movie worth seeing.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Don't start this if you need to get other things done.<br />Also make sure that you have a friend or book club to discuss the ideas.
B0019IB0II|5.0|This book offers many insights, into the state of mind that a person experiences during a stroke, what is really helpful for people recovering from strokes, and her &#34;stroke of insight&#34; that it is possible to change how we think about our lives.
B00BFV1JVM|4.0|Basically it is a young adult or older teen novel.<br />In many ways reminiscent of John Marsden's Tomorrow when the war began series.<br />Plenty of fast paced action and page turning storylines. I felt it started to get a bit tired by the third novel, or maybe I was just getting a bit tired!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Enthralling story set just before WWI and continuing. Fantastic sets, wonderful dialog, multi layered characters. Beautiful to watch. Themes abound like classism, sexism, ethnocentrism...and the regulars, love, hate, jealousy. A must see.
B002TXZT7K|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith provides a lot of dry humour.<br />It can be quite embassing as you read through a passage and find yourself snorting or laughing out loud on the train.<br />Always good to have a handkerchief ready so that you can turn it into a cough!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I love neo soul, and clearly Justin does too.  He also loves Prince, because there's enough of that here. This clearly is a work of production and money, and it works.
B005GQ5IA0|3.0|Good all around, but you can see some of the twists coming. Still a very good anthology by one of the masters of the genre.
1476733953|5.0|I picked this book because it had more than 4K user ratings. The story started slow but after a while, I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was living in the silo with its characters. Wow, what a ride.<br /><br />Now I'm reading the prequel 'Silo Omnibus' :)
076421120X|5.0|Revealing Jesus by Darlene Zschech is a 365-day devotional that has truly enriched my personal morning moments in the recent weeks. Filled with scripture, hymns, and lots of encouragement, this stunning keepsake of a book is the perfect addition to your daily time with Elohim.<br /><br /> What I liked... (the book)<br /><br /> Aside from the attractive cover and journal-like pages, I really enjoy the way the daily scriptures are set up. Rather than a random scripture each day, like other devotionals I own, Darlene sticks with a section of scripture or theme for several days straight. For the past two weeks, each entry has begun with a scripture from Matthew. I like staying on one theme or concept for several days because it allows for deeper study and personal reflection.<br /><br /> I also think this book is unique for the lyrics to hymns and worship songs that are sprinkled throughout its pages. There is just something about worshipping my Savior in song that sets a tone for the day. I feel uplifted and freed when I sing to the One who gave it all for me. As Darlene is a renowned songwriter and worship leader, I felt this attribute fit perfectly in her book.<br /><br />The CD...<br /><br />Darlene Zschech's Revealing Jesus CD is a great resource if you need reminding that your Maker loves you. The overall theme of the twelve songs included on the CD seemed to be, \\"God is here, revealing Himself to us. He wants to be our everything, the Center of our lives\\". My favorite song on the CD is one I have heard many times. \\"Your Name\\" is a great reminder of Who is really in charge.<br /><br />Darlene's Beautiful voice and clear heart for worship emanates through the speakers as you listen to her sing. Revealing Jesus is a great companion to Darlene's devotional and also stands great on its own. What better way to fall into His arms than in devoted worship? Crank up the volume, and abandon yourself to Him.<br /><br /> Recommendation...<br /><br /> Whether you are searching for the perfect Mother's Day or graduation gift this spring, or just need a little something new for your personal time with the King of Kings, you need not look any further than Revealing Jesus by Darlene Zschech. I found the book intimate, reflective and beautiful. I recommend it and would purchase it myself the next time I am looking for a gift for a loved one.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br /><br />I received a copy of Revealing Jesus through the Bethany House Blogger Review Program. I also received the mp3 album from Hoganson Media. I was not asked to write a positive review. All views and opinions expressed are solely and completely my own. I received no compensation other than a print copy of Revealing Jesus, which is mine to keep.for the perfect Mother's Day or graduation gift this spring, or just need a little something new for your personal time with the King of Kings, you need not look any further than Revealing Jesus by Darlene Zschech.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This app isn't  scary I mean you just have to find signs&middot;But you<br />should buy it if you have a little brother or sister&middot;They will freak out if<br />you show it to them&middot;
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I seriously hope this is a series. I could not put this book down and want to see where it continues to go. I wouldn't say I have the best imagination but this reverted me back to a state of childlike fantasies. I felt I could picture everything as it was happening.
078617286X|4.0|A good history lesson but would have liked more on South American, African, and Eastern histories.  There was too much on the wars between European powers in the middle ages.  It seemed to discuss too much about the wars between Germany, Italy, Prussia etc.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Do you remember those old studies about millions of hours of productivity lost to solitaire on windows?  Kinda like that.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|One of the best games ever. You can play alone or challenge your friends. Can you beat your friends? I beat mine!!!
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|If you have enjoyed any of the several Jesse Stone shows on TV based on the books by Robert B. Parker you will enjoy watching this one too.  Multiple stories that are eventually connected in a surprising way and an unusual ending.  I enjoy the characters in the Paradise Police Department and their interactions with Jesse (Tom Selleck).
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Mad Men is sliding, skidding on ice, and out of control. What has happened to Matthew Weiner's vision?  Our character's are aging, but with the exception of Peggy Olson, they are not maturing. They are not finding new ways to experience life and to deal with their internal emptiness. Don, Pete, Ken, Joan, Roger, etc. are all moving aimlessly from from affair to the next. I think that the writers have misjudged the public's desire for the same old same old.  This is why the audience abandons hit shows, especially dramas, that do not move and progress. Writers then panic and throw in a medical event or an automobile accident in a vain attempt to re-engage the audience.  This show is on the slippery slope and needs a new vision. How about Don's wife kills herself in front of him with a knife, Peggy consoles Don, and they enter into a real relationship with Peggy in control, and Don being forced to grow up at last. He can get involved in his kids' lives like the rest of us, find religion, and give back to society ???  Who am I kidding?  Don is more likely to go on trial for murdering one of his one night stands.
0307456633|3.0|Well written and humorous--just not my type of book.  Others who have read, i.e., some close friends, have loved it.
B0088TG252|5.0|An excellent &#34;on the run&#34; movie. Denzel Washington is always great, and he picks good stories to be in. There are more bullets expended in this movie than most wars in the third world. But it all ends well for the good guy. Your job is to figure out who is the bad guy.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I chose this product for the price. But it has been great.My kindle is secure, It  stands easily, it,s a great fit, and easy to hold on to. It's everything  it was advertised to be. Thanks
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I am fond of &#34;coming of age&#34; movies. This one has the added dimension of the main character dealing with the trauma of his aunt's death. She was very important to his childhood. Emma Watson gives a good performance as the friend and kindred soul that Charlie needs to deal with his emotional issues. Like all good coming of age movies, this one has a feel good ending.
B006GLT8FK|5.0|one of the best comedies i have seen Bruce is awesome and so was Matt. great combination of actors.... and tha Lazlo character is too funny.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Perfect for kids 3 and over. I'm sure it will become a classic in your household.<br />Love it. Highly Recommended.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci is a great writer.  He always draws me in from the get-go and keeps me coming back for more.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|The first one that I bought was no good , but I reordered this a second time and the anticapation was killing me and when I got to watch it it was great as I love most hero movie's.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show has me stuck to my seat from the bigging.. lots of twists and turns. I never could tell who the villians were. Very well scripted and acted on all fronts..
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I was really glad that this followed the the first 3 series and I absolutlry loved this movie. Keeping with the story line and using as many of the original cast as possible made this a great movie.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|This is a very interesting movie about the making of Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho.  Definitely a must see.  Give a good look into the life of Hitchcock.
B00028HBKM|5.0|For the greast things that GOD as given us even tho it was in subtitles, I could not help to get emotional.
0061692034|3.0|So. Canada. This is a book about a 15-year-old boy named Dell whose parents decide to rob a bank, which completely disrupts his and his twin sister's lives. The story is told by an older Dell looking back on the whole experience, but he manages to keep his younger self's perspective.<br /><br />It's a very quiet book. All of the strange events (bank robbery, crossing the border to run from the law, etc.) are presented very calmly. Most of the time, they're even sort of spoiled by the narrator before they even take place. But the point doesn't really seem to be to thrill the reader with the events, it's too look more closely at them and the people doing such things. That's my issue with the book, though. I don't think that it can't have both aspects.<br /><br />Almost the entire first half of the book is set up for the bank robbery that is mentioned in the first line. I wouldn't normally have that much of an issue with that (probably), but it was a lot of the narrator explaining how his parents, the robbers, are rather than showing us through their actions. Then, the second half, after the robbery actually occurs. I think I would've liked it better if it was a bit less subdued and a bit more consequential. But I can't deny that the adult characters Dell got thrown into the lives of were interesting. And I did love how Ford represented small, dying off towns. His writing isn't embellished (normally a con for me), but his descriptions of these places still left a very strong impression on me.<br /><br />So. Canada. Maybe I went in with too high of expectations. I liked the characters, I liked most of the points about people/events that the narrator made (though he didn't necessarily need to say all of them outright to us). But I found myself excited to be finished so I could go on to read something else. Not the best sign.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I really did'nt know what to expect with this movie, but it turned out really good for this type of movie.
B003BWERF8|5.0|It works well with my iPod classic,and both Bluetooth headphones. I would recommend it for anyone that has an iPod classic and just tired of the wires
B006O6F932|5.0|This was for my granddaughter for Christmas. Hard to find in stores at the time. She loves playing with it.
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|Plot ok.  Would have like to have real extra footage of Hitchcock and his wife iwthin the DVD.  &#34;The Girl&#34; is better
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Another great season! I love seeing the relationships building between the team members and seeing how they work together so well.
0788859544|5.0|She loves Ariel and we found this and purchased came as described and has been added to our rotation!  My 3 year old loves all disney princesses but has found a larger love for Miss Ariel!
B003XURDAY|5.0|Wonderful special effects for the time this movie was made.<br />Love Harrison's early work and Rutger Hauer was complete evil.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book seemed inspired by the Jaycee Dugard kindapping case, this. The engaging narrator is a completely believable 5-year-old who is blissfully unaware of the reality of the Room he and and his mother live in. A fascinating, suspenseful novel.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz. I am addicted to it. It is fun and fast paced. Love the themed rooms. They keep it interesting.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyed.<br /><br />Saw the movie first and actually liked it better.  The tying in of the Capital people in the movie made the storyline more interesting.<br /><br />Book was good overall.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|A fun and totally ridiculous romp through the Old west and South. At no time does this movie make any pretense of being factual or accurate and that's half the fun.  Look for some winks and nods to classic comedy westerns such as Blazing Saddles andnniconic stars such as Slim Pickens.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I love Tim O..and this was an interesting plot. New I wish they would hurry up with part 2. I want to see what other powers the rest have..the Aussie did say &#34;stay tuned.&#34;
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|never heard of them before  i was in the gym heard this is not a drive by  asked someone what group  went on line to see video and heard their music and decided to get cd  a lot of the songs mention death?  i love 50 ways to say goodby and the video also  lot of energy in their music
B001D09OAI|5.0|silly, but funny. brought back a lot of memories from the first time i saw this movie. no thinking required.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|this story is a grand disappointment. Crude humor (butts) and other similar antics were supposed to make us laugh. If it makes a girl brave to stand up against your mother... this world is in sorrier shape than I thought.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel has not lost a step, outstanding story and acting, Inspiring, Drama and shines the light on drinking in our society.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Love love the chameleon and the horse and their antics. This is an awesome family movie - from beginning to end.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie and all the other action stars, really was over the top, great action and fighting.For action fans get it.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|Honestly do some research before giving apps a 1 star.  Read the description to learn that this is the original game with additions that make it more accessible, hence &quot;playground.&quot; Look up the developer next time if you have doubts.  As far as permissions, the are exactly the same as the original Bridge Constructor...go fig.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I can't wait for the next movie to come out, Looking forward to the next one of the series, so I can buy.
0312539517|5.0|Jeffrey Archer always has interesting twists to his books. In this historical novel that is very closely based on fact, he examines mountaineer George Mallory's life.  Archer makes a good argument that Mallory and fellow climber Andrew Irvine reached the summit of Mount Everest, only to die on their descent.  Everest historians actually to this day have no idea whether the pair were the first to reach the summit, as what little we know is completely inconclusive.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I didn't think anyone could replace Sean Connery, but Daniel Craig has done it, hands down, he's got my vote.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app works better than the mobile app I had.  I can check and reply to messages.  It doesn't seem to have as make glitches as the standard app.
B0095P29EG|4.0|It was better than I expected. Very entertaining. Good action. Story line was a bit thin but overall I liked it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I went to see this film in the theater and absolutely loved it for all the usual reasons people like Peter Jackson's work but--to be honest--I prefer it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy because of the emphasis on the story and the characters.  Personally, the battle scenes in some of the previous films went on for too long for me and while this film had plenty of action, it wasn't burdened by it.  Can't wait for the next film!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I do not recommend this book, I got it because it was a daily deal but still not worth the money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A great game for destressing. Much better than going to Chuck e. Cheese to play. Highly addicting without wasting too much time at once.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Once you started reading this book was hard to put down! It was a good read. It developed quickly and moved very fast.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Robin's latest release is a real treat.<br /> Though I love to hear his rocking side, his blues side is also a pleasure to hear.<br />He just seems to know where to put the notes and spaces in the songs.<br />A young Trower probably could not play with this much taste and assurance.<br />In closing, his output of new music for the last decade or so has been quite impressive.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|You either like this movie or you don't. Many enhancements have been made since the film was released and each time the quality of the product has been improved. 3D certainly adds something to this movie but it is patchy. The backgrounds (especially the sky) are still grainy, but the close ups and indoor shots are cleaner and give a good 3D experience. If you watch the 3D version in 2D there is do discernable improvement over the original Blu-ray version.
B00BKBCF38|3.0|There are some cool grooves, but this sound quality is a joke.  Whoever mixed this needs to hit the unemployment line.  ( Don't worry Obama will take care of you ).  As for the songs, they are ok at best.  For such a ominous appearance, it is almost laughable to hear these tunes.  I expect to hear something a bit more aggressive.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I couldn't love this series more if I tried. It is such a full story; rich in detail, the characters are so well written and I find myself so immersed I can't put it down once I start reading.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|I Loved it then, I love it now!!! Genesis will always be one of my fav's!!! A1 & a 100 % all around!!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book is a classic and has earned its rank rightfully so. It takes you on an epic journey with Jim Hawkins and the rest of the crew aboard the Hispaniola in search of Captain Flint's treasure. It really doesn't get any better than that. It's riveting, engaging and will stay with me for many years.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Instructions on how to operate it are lacking & I wish the battery live was better, but it is a very good product.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Formula writing ok but need more pages and plot for the cost. Needs new characters and twists compared to prior excellent efforts.

B0096HNDXY|5.0|I've listed to Kylie Minogue for years as she was popular in Asia and Australia. I love her music and loved this cd.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. THe only trouble I have is in trying to even find a radar map, much less run it. Other than that, it works well. There are other weather maps that do a better job with the local weather, that I prefer.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I just finished this book and enjoyed it very much.  I laughed, I cried, and was very sad to come to the end.
B001Q2ZHZE|5.0|I didn't read all the reviews.  This movie is great.  I've seen it several times.  It's a love story, but it's also a story about changing the past.  You'll enjoy it.
B000I8JEY2|5.0|Its full of action and comedy. What more could you ask for? It's definitely says mid 90s and Will Smith.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I am not really a MM fan, but I always found him intriguing.  The book is a bit disturbing at times (and I'm a wimp) but it's nothing that would make you stop reading.  I was hoping to get some insight into what made MM the way he is.  I definitely got that, but there were still some questions left hanging.
B0095G5AFU|4.0|This app required a true struggle to figure out how it worked. Because I am a writer, it is one of the few apps I can us to keep notes consistently. A lot of fun!
B005IQZB14|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that kept me up at night.  Hiking the Pacific Crest trail and the insight into the daunting journey it can be both physically and emotionally was very well written.
B000JMKNV0|4.0|I saw the movie prior to reading the book, but was not disappointed. The book does so much more in helping to understand how deeply troubled the main character is that the movie could never get across
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Great movie.  We really enjoyed it.  It is always nice to set at home and be able to stop the movie when you need to leave the room.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well written. Excellent cast.<br /><br />If for no other reason, you should watch this series for Maggie Smith who delivers the best zingers!
B0095VPAVE|4.0|I love the performance, although i dont use it for gaming. I do have multiple virtual machines running and it works great. I think the only thing i dont like is the noisy fan that come with it. I should have bought another fan...but thats it....I definately do recommend this APU.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|This story was lovely and a good story, but could have been much shorter.  I got bored about halfway through and felt like I was trapped on a boat.
B0088T3B0G|1.0|It's really bad! If I had the opportunity to watch it for free I still would not.even consider it for any reason.
B0091REZMW|5.0|fun game... best hidden object game app for kindle! definite five stars for sure and highly recommend for others. awesome
B00BMVTTJ4|2.0|It was like watching a made for TV Disney movie, not the Peter Jackson film I was expecting. The movie moves at the pace of a snail as it tries to stall the progress of the story with random musical scenes and pointless comedy scenes that do nothing to further character development or plot. The interpretation of the dwarves in this was sadly done. Overall, a really bad interpretation of the Hobbit book. Just rent this, don't buy it!
B000000I3O|4.0|This gem really highlights The Misfits great sound and amazing lyrics. The songs are great quality and a testament to punk. The only downside is that no lyric booklet is included.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Intellectually stimulating as well a cometic, you really fall in love with this rendition of Sherlock Holmes and Watson! Very unique characters and settings! A must watch!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very fun game, nice to have a pay alternative to the free ad version. Six more words are required to submit.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed the series and loved all the characters. Heartbreaking moments followed with life and recovery. Peers and Katniss deserve their future.
B00136M0GC|5.0|He has the unique ability to produce and perform soothing and heart-felt songs. I was drawn to the song &#34;What if you&#34; that I heard while watching the movie &#34;Catch and Release&#34;.  I was haunting and so beautiful.  I read the credits at the end of the movie and wound up buying the entire album.  All of the songs are beautiful.  This is my second Josh Radin album I've purchased.  I love his style!
B00B8PRDHE|1.0|Being a professional musician myself, you can tell when a band is into a performance or just going through the motions. I actually felt sorry for Ringo while watching this. It looked and felt like a second rate lounge band. All of the songs seemed dead and the rhythm was off I doubt the mics on Ringo's set were even turned on. All said this show was an embarrassment, I found myself looking forward to the end after just a few songs.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|As a Big Fish member for several years, I had already played this game in demo mode. It's fun, and well worth the money. I would recommend to anyone.  The only issue I sometimes have is that my finger covers too much of the puzzle piece and I can't see where to put it.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|As always, Depeche Mode has put together another masterpiece that has remnants of Violator and Ultra.  On my way to Santa Barbara Bowl!!!!!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Typical Adam Sandler production, good story happy ending. Hey I liked it you decide for yourself!<br />Great for the family.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|While often proclaiming that a 15 year-old boy can't be expected to make connections, the entire book is about the boy's introspection and making connections about the words and deeds of others.  Characters are too broadly drawn and much of the plot is implausible.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great season with lots of twists and turns and just the right amount of suspense to keep you focused, can't wait for season 4
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I think Bingo Blitz is the best bingo on facebook. I play every day. It offers many levels of play and gives plenty of free credits. In addition, you receive rewards of credits or coins for leveling up,and it adds up quickly. A fun diversion, but watch out; it can be addictive!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I was looking for this video and could not find it locally and while surfing the web, I found it online. I will recommend your company to others without hesitation. Thanks.
B000FA675C|5.0|The book is even better the second time I read it.  I had forgotten how much detail Dan Brown puts into the book.
B0025WX2YW|4.0|I really enjoyed this series good characters, interesting time line to follow... Something to watch on my Kindle while hubby watched his shows.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Fascinating story!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is that some of the scenes were extremely improbable.  However, the author was a DA, so maybe he knows morre than I do.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Ken Follett hits a home run again. Never a better writer. The intrigue, style and content are fantastic and exciting.
B000M53GM2|5.0|One of the best James Bond's action films. Comparable to the impact Sean Connery had with Goldfinger and From Russia With Love.  Craig did likewise with Casino Royle.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did - it was deeper and held greater meaning than you'd be led to belive.  Worthwhile, and difficult to put down!
1451697686|4.0|I must admit, I bought this book having never read the blog, or hearing a word about the author.  My husband randomly asked me the other day how we have so much trash, and Amazon recommended the book to me based on browsing history, which I took as a sign and ordered it.  It is a very informative book, and as quick a read as you choose for it to be. The sections are laid out very well so you can pick and choose what you'd like to read.  I read all of the book except for the section on children which I skimmed quickly.  I was actually pleasantly surprised by how many things mentioned in the book we already do, considering the comment on our trash situation.  I know that our biggest waste is paper towels and this was very lightly addressed, but she did give some options for homemade reusable options which I fully intend to look into. I loved how open she was on their previous lifestyle and made it abundantly clear that the past doesn't matter, you shouldn't dwell on that, just do anything you can do to reduce your carbon footprint for the future which I appreciated.  The author is very humble and open about their both good and bad experiences being \\"green.\\"  Not living in California or another super progressive city does have its limitations on ability to do some of the options mentioned.  For example, I regularly purchase bulk items whenever possible, but in our area the only bulk items offered are nuts/flours/snacks/grains. Not soap, shampoo, or cooking oils or coffee.  I completely agree with the philosophy that recycling should not be our best option. The most helpful part of the book is the resources information, compiled for ease of access.  The resources included options for you to mail back items that are otherwise trash in most counties, websites and phone numbers to remove you from junk mailing lists, how to find bulk shopping in your area or even a website to find milk packaged in glass bottles in you area.  The resources list is perhaps the most helpful to me in that it is one area, while it is all info you could find online, she did the legwork for you, so you have no excuse to not try to make a change.<br /><br />I think this is a great book for anyone looking to make their routine a little more environmentally friendly. There is an in depth section on different types of composting options which would help anyone get started to figure out the best set up for them.  The author makes it clear that she doesn't expect anyone to do more than they are comfortable with or that seriously interferes with life, which is nice.  She also makes it clear that doing what she has done, which is further than most people will probably take the concept, is hard.  I highly recommend the book for a casual read, I think I will send it to my mom, who could definitely use a little green in her routine.  The only thing worth mentioning, and why I rated it four stars rather than five, is that aside from the resources, most of this is not new information to me, so for many people who would be looking at this book I would assume it is mostly a rehash of things we already know. Compost what you can, rid your home of chemicals, stop throwing away plastic, stop wasting your money on things you will throw away in a month or two because they are junk, stop buying things from companies you don't believe in, etc. With that being said, I am going to go online now look into some of the resources the author mentioned that I didn't know about.me in that it is one area, while it is all info you could find online, she did the legwork for you, so you have no excuse to not try to make a change.<br /><br />I think this is a great book for anyone looking to make their routine a little more environmentally friendly.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This one was a page turner and I read it on a 5 1/2 hour flight, so it kept me going. But that is not to say I liked everything about it. It was our Book Group selection and it generated a very lively discussion with about half liking the book and the other half not liking it. One gave up after 100 pages saying it was too dysfunctional. I did not like the ending but don't want to put that here and ruin it for other readers! I only recommend it to some of my reader friends. Kind of like a movie I know some friends would enjoy but not others.  I give it 3 and 1/2 stars.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Whats not to love about a Star Wars Lego product. I have yet to find one too difficult to put together. My 4 and 5 yo boys love love this set. They really love C3P0 and R2D2.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|It was like i was there in the movie. Have been a fan since it came out. Did not understand why it did not recieve better reviews. Would recommend.
B001JRB16U|5.0|What bad thing could be said about this classic Disney movie? My 4 and 5 yo boys love the songs and the dancing. They really connected with the kids and loved the fun adventures they went on with Bert and Mary.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny and entertaining movie!<br />The actors/actresses are good.  You dont have to worry about being bored while watching this movie.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Brilliant movie, I absolutely love the music. All the actors did a marvelous job! The product worked great, dvd did not have any scratches, came on time, and is a wonderful movie to add to the collection!
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|What should I say about a new set of heroes? See for yourself. Nice in 3d. What age are your children?
B008602KQI|5.0|I really liked this movie and so easy to watch at home, just a click of a button!  Love Prime!
B0019LZV4E|5.0|I love musicals  If you don't, you probably won't enjoy Sweeney Todd.  The cast is excellent and you'll recognize a few big names here including Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Alan Rickman.  This movie is fun, creepy. and a little gruesome.  I'm surprised to see the &#34;R&#34; rating, but it's probably not appropriate for anyone under the age of 15.<br /><br />I have watched this movie many times and it never disappoints.
B005HS00NW|5.0|This album will be remembered for having the best song of the decade on it: Midnight City. It will also go down as an amazing piece of work featuring stunning sounds, beautiful lyrics and space magnitude of old.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait for third book next year. Good characters . Some of past history explained. Follett captures all the pain &  joy of turbulent times
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is full of adventure,romance,and blood that you just can't find in the first book. They introduce more characters, more secrets, and way more suspense. Suzanne Collins did an excellent job.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An in depth interesting study of this strange but genius man. Entertaining and educational for anyone who wants to understand the how and why of Apple.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We really enjoy this movie and the kis have watched it marathon style. We thought the price was a great deal also.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|I could not stop watching season one and season two was just the same, completely gripping, enough to lose sleep over trying to work it all out!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I heard all of my friends at work talking about these books and finally I decided to find out for myself.  The story is wonderful.  But these books are not for the squeamish regarding sex.  This is definitely ADULT material.  It is tastefully done and definitely fun.
B000MXPE74|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album! LOVE IT! The CD arrived prior to the \\"due date\\" (ok, it was one day early.) Definitely gotta get this CD!
B005URRCUY|5.0|great album. bluesy.... rock... love it. was a birthday preasent to myself. play almost everynight at work, on replay. YUP.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Some good episodes.  Not enough payoffs for the amount of waiting they make the audience do.  The writing seems to wander and negate the believability of the looming threat of disaster.  Note to the producers: If your heroes are supposed to be surrounded, maybe make it hard for them to go on a road trip to casually stock up on guns.  Making your bad guy seem ineffective despite endless buildup, or easily lured into a trap annoys thinking audience members.  Best season so far, season 1.  Get more imaginative with your character's problem solving please.
B007N8RULO|4.0|this was a great game for kids and family to play no age limit to play the game for all of the family.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Archer's writing has really become so predictable and even boring.  Is he still writing everything himself?  How do I miss his earlier works. However, I must say I did enjoy Prisoner of birth.  It is just as if he is constantly underestimating his readers' intelligence.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very addictive and fun to see what creatures you can decode. Plus you have to make business decisions on where to spend the money you earn. Great game
B0074VA2T2|4.0|My grandkids will play it but it does not hold their interest for very long unlike some of the other apps.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting book. Depressing in some parts especially since the conditions in the orphanages apparently did exist. Sweet story overall. I enjoyed this book
B00004SAAY|4.0|Although I generally prefer the newer piano editions of Bach on recording, this is fully a first rate rendition - with harpsichord and chamber orchestra - with familiar names, on a high prestige label of many years. My only reservation - without which this would be a 5 star rating - is the slight harshness, stridency, notably in the 1st violins which are characteristically high in the mix (for DG/Archiv). The apparent dynamic compression which this label utilizes more than in the past exacerbates this situation. That said, everything else is so strong in this production, and reasonably priced, it is irresistible. 4 1/2 stars, if we're splitting hairs...
B00ALQSY2Y|5.0|Was very impressed with the unusual species in this program, many of which I had never heard of.  Very good program for kids and adults alike.
B000FA675C|5.0|Love Dan Brown and all of his books!  I've read them all!  They are captivating and you can't put them down once you start reading!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Evan I find my self playing this games when the kids are in bed. Great game for training your brain.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|A great movie for the whole family to enjoy<br />Brings back good memories<br />Disney nailed all the details spot on
B00846WWVM|5.0|A great distraction game for kids. Makes them use their brains. I like games that make my kids think a lot.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I found this alarm clock to be very easy to operate and I especially liked that it was free !
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Was really interesting, but got long as it went on and on about his adventures in Iraq. He was quite a hero and felt the loss of his buddies deeply. How he survived this and didn't loose his sanity is amazing.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This movie was amazing! Richard Gere  with he love and devotion tohis dog and  from his dog Hachi  brought tears to my eyes. I cried more than once.It is a true story. I  would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone to watch especially animal lovers.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read an article about this series on the bbc website. Now I see what all the fuss is about. Well developed characters that you can't help but get attached to, an engrossing plot, a great
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Brandon Sanderson is a master of creating new worlds, characters, and modes of magic.  The Way of Kings is a spectacular beginning to a ten part epic.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I love portal and getting the music was amazing. Also the Ap-sap that came with it was also great 5/5. Loved it
B0055SJVPW|5.0|I have read the book and loved it, watched the movie and still liked it.<br />I can watch it again on my blue day : )
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writing was so real, so well-thought out. The characters are so genuine, they develop and grow in such an appealing manner, that this hooked me from day 1!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Amazon thank you for this App.  Works better on my kindle than on my phone.  Makes it so much more easier and simple to use any time.
B004DTLK62|5.0|Wonderful to remember this success in high definition. The actor´s performances are amazing. The pack arrived here in Brazil without problems.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Have not watched the movie yet.  Looking forward to watching the movie in the near future on Prime. Hint, hint.. Amazon's
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Just what I was looking for when I needed a bag for my Rebel T3.  Very well constructed and I like the zippered compartments.
B008XFJEE2|4.0|Wow Mickey was very handsome back in his days.  I had to watch this movie again.  Liked it then, like it still today.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I honestly think this show is fantastic. I'm still getting through the last few episodes.<br /><br />One thing to note, Amazon's SD standard is just fine. I couldn't justify spending 15 dollars more on the HD equivalent, when the SD version looks just fine.<br /><br />It's definitely not as crisp, but I would have just bough the Bluray for the same money.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Dude... its Yahoo!  Need I say more.  But thank you Amazon's for the App, now if you can work on the IM App it would be complete.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A brilliant app and one that I use often on a daily basis.It's. Great to use and see in an instant how much charge I have left. I would recommend getting it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy and simple to use. I needed a calculator for homework and personal use. Wish I found it darker!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was suggested and provided as a solution to a charging problem with my older Kindle. It did not work but I am using it with the replacement kindle and it is great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you like subway surfers you will love temple run it has even more now caves ropes an more its temple run fun so I think you should get it. 100% love it.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|This app downloaded easily on my Acer tablet. It is a long book with about 5 things to see on every other page. It kept my 3 yr old grandson entertained.  The story lasted about 25 minutes. Well worth the money.
B0039RY3MM|2.0|the unit is sent in what looks like a syringe that over 1/2 the stuff bleeds into the cap of unit and literaly leaves you nothing to use for its task
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The movie had a lot of action, and at times humor, Morgan Freeman was good, and Helen Mirren very cool,  the plot I think should have been a bit more intriguing, it was the same plot we've seen over and over again, however it was entertaining and funny.<br />Oh and Bruce was being Bruce.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is very useful to see the strongest signals and where you might try when traveling.  This is highly recommended.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game to get your brain cells into play.  Trying to work out the necessary paths so that you can connect all of the colored dots is a mental challenge.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have been using this app for a couple of months and I love it. It is so easy to set alarms and have your music or lots of other sounds wake . You up. And is so easy to turn off or hit snooze.  GREAT. GREAT
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is my first reacher novel but won't be the last. The plot was plausible enough and reacher is made of steel. The other characters were detailed enough that you could easily decide who to like or not. I found it hard to put down.
B00571F26Y|3.0|If it works for you, great!  I purchased this book hoping to find some answers to my weight issues and halfway thru the book the statement is made that this only refers to those with belly fat, not bottom weight.  Bummed.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My wife loves this show, she has the first two seasons, so I thought this would be a great birthday present.
B007SGM084|4.0|This, by no means, should be read by anyone younger than adult.  I read through all 3 books but about halfway through the first book I felt it was a one note....proven correct by continuing my commitment to read through all.
0525953728|5.0|OK, This is the first book I have read in over 20 years.  Yes, I do not enjoy reading... But, I wanted to read this book for some reason.  I bought it and am over half way through it.  It has kept my interest and I like the short story format.  It is a bit out or sequence in the story telling, but they tell you they are doing that for a reason.  But I can still follow it and that is amazing if you know me.  I am a detail oriented person and like things in order. 1, 2, 3, 4 Next item type of person.  But I have laughed (which may be stange to some) I have felt emotion and am hooked on this book.  I read it in between my youngest dance competions.  I would recomend this to any one interested in the perspectives of someone in the military that seems to have done some increadible things around the world.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|enjoyed the book. couldn't put it down until i finished reading it. Clancy is my favorite writer.<br />Highly recommend it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|both my six and two year old got a kick out of this movie. Have watched it over and over again.  Like the lesson about doing the right thing.
044654759X|5.0|Could not put down. Do not know how compares to movie because wanted<br />to read first.  Great book would read anything he writes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|my fav notes app is evernote this rocks and works without issues go ahead download it wont be regrets the voicenotes pictures integration the multiplatform (windows android and web)
B0081336FO|5.0|Sharp, tense dialogue and action<br />Beautifully filmed in London and other locations<br />Characters have real depth- good writing, good acting
B00BF11STU|4.0|Historically speaking, the movie was spot except for a the implication that intelligence to the courier's whereabouts came from torture.  History is still being written, but multiple US Senators signed a letter stating that torture did not, in fact, lead to any helpful intelligence.
B00BF123WG|3.0|They dialog has this mindset: We wrote a crappy script, so lets add F-bombs to try to make it cool!<br /><br />Sorry, but it didn't help one bit. The acting is poor. The story line drags on, but the last 20 minutes is cool when the SEALs enter the scene.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|Very neat and artistic film, a unique perspective and interesting point of view!!!! I really think this film is fabulous.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Had to have it to complete the set!  Always a pleasure to watch with the incredible detail to costumes and set.
B008602KQI|1.0|Howbin the world did this movie get such a high rating? Either it doesn't take much to entertain people these days, or people really are getting less intelligent with every generation. It probably won't be long before Idiocracy becomes a documentary....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Just started it, but can't put it down. so far this book is great. I definitely recommend it. this is the first Kindle book I have bought.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the most outstanding performances and stories I've had the privilege to watch. I am always looking forward to the next episode.<br />The cast of characters is wonderful!
0061020710|4.0|This is definitely one of the weakest of Pratchett's Discworld series. However, it is important to read the beginning to understand the rest. Don't be discouraged if you don't enjoy this book much. Once you pick up Guards! Guards! you'll be in love with Pratchett's writing, I promise
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Same great voice and music from Diana Krall.  Love her voice and I can listen to it all day without getting tired of her.
0061433063|5.0|This is my favorite of the Tiffany Aching series. It brings back a great character we haven't seen in a long time, and explains her absence, and has some excellent interactions with The Watch and other Ankh Morpork characters.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I really enjoy Boz and &#34;Memphis&#34; doesn't disappoint.  I was a bit concerned about another &#34;genre change&#34; album, but Boz does a great job with &#34;Memphis&#34;.  It's a must have.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|While it's not 100% perfect, they did a fantastic job of bringing my favorite musical to the big screen! You won't be disappointed!
B000V6991Y|3.0|This is tough to listen to.  It's clear that this band had either broken up or was breaking up during its recording.  If you are a big Supertramp fan, you'll need this to complete your collection.  If you are a casual Supertramp fan, you'll be disappointed.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It was quite enjoyable, though I still can't believe she didn't base it of Battle Royale. Would recommend for a lazy Sunday.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a great read. Fast paced, well defined characters, a believable universe. For someone in his late 40's like me, it was an absolute delight, with all those references to the video games that helped defined our childhood and teen years. It fits so well in what could have been our future as we saw it then. I strongly recommend this book.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Great books that your kids could read with or without their parent. I love reading my son this book little by little every night as our reading time before bed thank you to the great book
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this game--the different levels are challenging and the graphics are neat.  The grandkids and I fight over this one!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I have always loved this movie and I want to see it every Christmas season. It's my favorite version - with Natalie Wood. It's timeless.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|I've never even heard of steampunk so I was confused often by some of the vernacular in this book, but I do love a good paranormal romance so I gave it a try. It took me several chapters to really get into the story, but I eventually got there.overall I liked it and will most likely read the next one when it's released
B001GA1RFA|4.0|This book is good. Doesn't really live up to other books by him tho. It is still nice and interesting
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'll find out if it's a good book after I read it.  I just ordered it.  Your request for a rating is a bit premature.
1407130366|5.0|I saw the first movie before I read the books.  The books are excellent!  The characters are drawn so well.  I found myself reading for hours at a time, wanting to know what would happen next.  I found myself cheering on the main characters, and despising the villain.  These are a must read for anyone.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easier than carrying a book around. I can work on my tablet and take a break to read a book..
0679720200|5.0|I could read this book over three times in one week and love it every time i did so. Incredible book that makes you think and leaves your mind blown
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|A new twist on the gladiator concept (with a much more attractive heroine) in a strange Orwellian world where technology has created wonderful devices...except in the coal-mining industry.
B00846REIS|5.0|I know there are lots of fsog fans out there and trust me i am too...but bared to you was like fsog without the over repeating and the kinky sex. Oh it has hot sex just not as kinky! It was one of my favorite reads that i just couldnt wait to turn the page.
B000V92WD8|3.0|First, let me get this out of the way. I love this concert, the idea of S&G's reunion, the song selections, the exuberance of the crowd - the whole thing just lifts me up when I can use a boost. And, I also find vinyl recordings much my preference to CDs. I usually forgo the audiophile descriptions and just say that LPs sound must closer to live music, while CDs sound like recordings which are thinner and more constrained to my ear. So in 95% of the cases, I will listen to an LP when available. Now, that combined with this being one of my very favorite pop albums seemed like a sure thing. The seller shipped a nearly immaculate copy. It could not have been played much at all. I was excited. Unfortunately this one falls in the 5%, as ever so often the CD which followed actually cleaned up the sound. Maybe it is the nature of the miking at the live venue, but this just lacks the dynamics I seek.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Ever buy a cd and only listen to one or two songs? Well not this one! This cd is good from the first to the last song. You can play it with any type of mood your in:)
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I stumbled onto a Palladia telecast of Joe's remarkable concert at the Vienna Opera House. I was mesmerized. The man lives his music totally and fiercely. You see it, hear it, and feel it -- big time. If you have even the slightest interest in beautifully crafted blues told in 21st century style, you have to purchase this stunning account of his performance. I'm a Rolling Stones, Who, Doors, Animals guy. I don't usually listen to this kind of music. But, I've been converted. Anyone who appreciates superb musicianship, a great voice, and music respectful of our blues roots will find this album a must-have.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Thought it was ok. Green Lantern has always been one of my favorite comic book heroes when i was coming up. So i guess i expected more of this one.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We watched this movie with our sisters.  They had never seen the movie before.  It was awesome.  This movie was all the best.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Great service! Would use again! Courteous and very inexpensive compared to others for the same product! Was received much sooner than anticipated.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|Contact has big ambitions and satisfies most of them and entertains the rest. To start it is based upon a novel by Carl Sagan and he is able to give the science fiction aspect of the film credibility from his own insight in the science community. The film depicts quite well the drive and determination the scientists must possess just to be able to work in their chosen fields and the way that politics comes into play to create hurdles and roadblocks. Interlaced within the science film is the human story of personal tragedy, discovery and betrayal. This is not explored to create in depth character studies but just enough to make the audience care about the characters. The one angle of the film that I find most compelling is the struggle between religious faith and scientific discovery. This is not so far-fetched, recall that Copernicus’ theory of the universe was banned by the church and that he delayed publication of his work until after his death for fear of excommunication and execution.<br />The casting and the acting were top notch Jodie Foster (Elle Arroway)carried the dedicated scientist role believably well in what would have been a male role in most movies. Elle is far from a perfect character she has faults and flaws aplenty, she has issues with closeness and being able to see another’s viewpoint. You can see here struggle for truth whatever it is from others and herself. Her life is dedicated to searching for evidence of the unknown and proving irrefutably the truth in it.  Matthew McConaughey (Palmer Joss)was perfect in the traditional female role of the would be love interest that just so happens to show up whenever a tender moment is required and who though drawn to Elle he is spiritually and philosophically her polar opposite. His life is driven by faith knowing that cannot be proven but he believes it with all his heart.<br />I think one of the things I like most about the film is that it asks more questions than it answers. There is no attempt to paint Elle as a perfect character that will save the day, or to say yes there are aliens and they are here to harvest us or give us better iPods. More so the film asks “What if? And if so how would you react?”paint Elle as a perfect character that will save the day, or to say yes there are aliens and they are here to harvest us or give us better iPods. More so the film asks “What if? And if so how would you react?”
B001AQQR2S|5.0|My kids have watched this show over and over for years even my 3 year old loves it Definately a great show
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|The romance of King Edward VIII (James D'Arcy) and Wallis Simpson (Andrea Riseborough) has been retold many times before, most notably (for me at least) in the TV series EDWARD AND MRS. SIMPSON with Edward Fox in the title role.  Madonna's version of the tale juxtaposes the story with a present-day tale involving Wally Winthrop (Abbie Cornish), her violent husband William (Richard Voyle) and a Russian intellectual employed at Sotheby's in New York, Evgeni (Oscar Isaac).  The parallels are obvious enough: Wally identifies with Mrs. Simpson and contrasts her own mundane existence with that of the royal lover.  Eventually she comes to realize that she has the kind of life-choices denied to Mrs. Simpson.  Shot in rock-video style, with fast cuts preventing any real identification with the characters, W.E. actually seems like an attempt by director Madonna to make sense of her own life as a singer/actress/celebrity.  The settings are well drawn; the performances competent (even though D'Arcy looks nothing like the real Duke of Windsor).  However the narrative tends to drag a little as it moves towards its predictable end.  The film has certain incidental pleasures, notably the appearance of Turkish actor/star Haluk Bilginer as Mohammed Al Fayed.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have been looking for a dictionary since I got the Kindle Fire last November.  Didn't want to pay for one found this free app! Love it. Love the word of the day.  I feel smarter already!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It's a good game. But after about a year or two it gets a little tiresome to play. But my brother enjoys it.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|I've been a Malick fan for a long time, since I first saw Badlands many years ago.  In this film he's combined some of the classic themes and motifs from Badlands and Days of Heaven, while still continuing down the path he's been on with his more recent, more unapologetically existential work.  I think To The Wonder is a far more successful film than Tree of Life.  Olga Kurylenko is awesomely gorgeous and deserves serious notice for her acting in the film.  I don't want to say more--it's a masterful work that manages to balance useful narrative and a connection to the incredible elements of ordinary experience on the one hand, along with the classic Malick attention to divinity in all its forms.  This is one of those films that will only get better with each repeat viewing, and I'm grateful that we have it.
B0086700CM|3.0|It's an ok game but it's not that addicting and fun like every one says it is. It might just be me on that opinion.
B00065MDRW|5.0|I first heard this album on vinyl almost forty years ago, and have always wanted to get a CD version. I'm glad I did. What a trip down memory lane and an in depth look at the music and philosophy of the 1960's.

B005LAIHZY|4.0|We've seen it previously, but we got this to watch at home and in the vehicle mostly for the kids entertainment on long drives to grandmas house etc. lol. The voice overs are great, the accents are enjoyable and the story is fun and funny for the kids. &#34; Oh, That scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell&#34;
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I started playing coin dozer on my android phone and although I really liked it I couldn't play it so well because the screen was so small. Then I found it in the Amazon apps store and figured I'd give it a try, and I am so glad I did. this game is so addictive and I love it!
B000RMUA10|5.0|What's not to love about this book?  Easy to read, no complicated, or stage-crafted, Hollywood infused drama.  This is a lovely story (and trust me - I'm a man that NEVER uses the word \\"lovely\\" to describe things) about a woman from the Bronx and her transatlantic dalliance with a staid London bookseller.  The story is told over changing decades from the aftermath of WWII to the late 70's.  Helene Hanff is both the author and subject of this book.  The book's title refers to the bookstore's address in London.  The story is about her life as a script reader, her love for rare and out of print books, and the bookseller (Frank Doel)who goes to great lengths to find those books for her.  Her ability to write about daily events makes you see and feel the changes that are occurring in America while Europe struggles to rebuild.  Before \\"You've Got Mail\\", \\"When Harry Met Sally\\", or even \\"The Notebook\\" - people would sometimes meet as penpals and could be charmed by one another's kindnesses.  There are no flashes of nudity here, no sordid details of extramarital affairs (Frank is married, with children).  Instead, you'll find two people who become friends through the mail and still respect one another in the morning.  A great read!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|if they struck back. This movie will offend many white people because it paints a point of view hated to be mention of. So it hated, cause a black man killed white people in this movie. But how dare this be on t.v. or dvd, giving the black people ideas.<br /><br />Ideas that this is a white man world and black are to be submissive. How dare to think that?<br /><br />Slavery went on for 500 years and I want to kick those slave behind for not standing up and fighting back. When some could easily over-powered and won for their freedom........freedom isn't free, it got be achieve<br /><br />and even today, white people tell us they are superior and black are evil and dumb...<br /><br />so I say, this is a good movie cause a black man stood for his' freedom and family and by damn \\"won\\".

B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I watch many movies, enough to be a little bit of a self proclaimed critic even.  This movie by far deserved the acclaim it has received.  The background, the characters and the interaction were quirky, uncomfortable and felt &#34;really in your face&#34;.  The message was clear and the ending matched the quality and originality of the rest of the film.  One of the best films I've seen in a very long time.
B004478AS4|5.0|Yes, an Excellent Story about life in Africa.  My son has lived in Accra, Ghana for six years, I have visited three times.  Life is difficult for Ghanayans, food is scarce, no money for pleasure.  True, the story by Chinua Achebe is in a different area of Africa, but the story is very real:  African people, like many people on this Earth, have lived for centuries with their beautiful beliefs.  How can Christians be so rude and callous to express that African culture and African beliefs are wrong?  All cultures need to respect the beliefs of others in this world.  This book has substance and reality.  Thank you.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|It is OK, nice reading. As a working woman, mother of small children there are things in this book I agree with and things I disagree. I am sure thats the intention of Sheryl: give some food for thought.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|You know, well you don't know but I'm going to tell you, I read a lot of books. Most of the time I don't feel inclined to write a review on the books I have read unless it is exceptionally over the top. This is one of those!!! Now to me a real review is about the story not how the author spells, if they forgot a period or if they used the right conjunctions. I mean if it looks like a 10 year old wrote it well that's different. To me a book that grabs you at the first chapter, drags you through the middle with your heart racing, your mind trying to figure out where this is going, your fingers swiping the screen of the kindle while your thinking why can't I read faster to find out what the heck is going on here all the way to the end where they leave you gasping,sweating and totally spent. Now that's a book!!!<br />Mr. Watson tells a gripping story of a woman that has lost her memory in an \\"accident\\". She wakes every day not knowing who she is. She relies on her husband to tell her this information. But....... there's always a but, can she trust him or is it just her paranoia that makes her question some things he's told her. She begins to keep a journal and writes in it daily her Dr. calls her to remind her to read it so she can see what she did the day before. Now I'm going to stop there so I don't spoil anything but trust me this is NOT a repetitive boring book. Yes some of it has to be but once your acclimated to her routine most of that is skipped over. This story takes on so many twists and turns so many scenarios that your imagination wants to believe is going to happen your going to be dizzy. If you like psychological thrillers this is a MUST READ!!!!!! Kudos to C.J Watson you made me a fan!!!!!
B000IY03DM|5.0|I have loved every set of songs they have done BUT noticed many are repeated and that's a shame ~ Nevertheless they are marvelous and love listening and/or watching them too

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It definitely was a lot more kid-friendly than 20-year-old gamer friendly (I went with a group of 5 nerdy dudes, and we had to wash it down with Man with the Iron Fist right after).  However, I still enjoyed the movie, and got a lot out of it.  Even if you don't get all the references, it stands on its own as a good movie that hits you in the feels
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book and the author made science fiction become a reality.  i read the first book and now i'm on the second.  Looking forward to finishing all 3 books. it is very good reading.  i definately recommend this book to a friend.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I thought this movie was great, better than expected; though I had low expectations when I started it.  It was action packed, had a great animated feel about it.  It had a basic storyline, just like all the other movies.  Some points made me scratch my head, but overlooking minor hiccups of the movie; the movie was fun to watch.
B009UZBLSG|2.0|I way about to order one of these and then my brother told me that I can order the very same slimport from the company that makes them for almost a 4th then what people are charging here...

B0083SBJXS|5.0|As a superhero fan, I Iove this movie. Its funny, serious when it needs to be, the characters are easy to like and it's entertaining.
B002RKSXJG|4.0|An intersting novel because of the time it was written. Only for nowadays readers it has too many descriptions and makes the reading difficult because you can not squip anything
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Having purchased all three parts of Lord of the Rings I was pleased to get the Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. It gives a good start to the background that led up to the Lord of the Rings. The Actual part of the story showing Bilbo's aquisition of the Ring was quite acceptable as it was very realistic. I am looking forward to the next two parts of this trilogy.

B004SUWR2C|3.0|I guess when I can get on line with my kindle I will be able to see if I like it or not
B006LSZECO|5.0|And the surprise is welcome. I loved Sharp Objects, Gillian Flynn's first novel, and Dark Places took me to desperate and dark places indeed. So, I don't know why I waited to read Gone Girl. Maybe it was The Hype. I tend to back away from the obvious, what the crowds love. Don't know why; I just do. I am a huge supporter of first novels. I like discovering new voices. Gone Girl kept pulling at me though and I finally broke down and read it from cover to cover, something that doesn't happen in my reading life. I tend to read twenty books at once, a chapter her and there, and the book that is the most exciting stays in the lead and I finish reading that one first. Gone Girl lives up and surpasses the popularity hype. I loved the structure, the back and forth between the husband and wife through a journal isn't anything new, but it was used to further the complex motivations of the characters. I highly recommend Gone Girl to anyone who enjoys off-center tales, suspense, and dark places.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernotes is a great app for notes thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks  thanks
B004GJYR7I|5.0|I just love this film &#34;Bringing Up Baby&#34; so much, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant are just so good together in this film. I saw this film so many time grow up as a kid in 1950's. Screwball comedies ever. Fast, good, and very, very funny.
B0091VZCES|5.0|I have the Errol Flynn Collectors pack and the quality of this on demand version is far superior (as it should be at HDX).<br /><br />I am rebuilding my DVD/Blu-ray library with digital versions so I can free up an entire wall of my living room and this was my latest addition and I'm happy with my purchase.<br /><br />However.. Amazon Prime video app on the PS3 (and perhaps other platforms) could use some work. The controls are often unresponsive to the point that it is sometimes necessary to quit the app and restart it just to resume from a paused point. But of course that has nothing to do with the product being reviewed.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Saw it in IMAX in the theatre. Great film! Love the bluray! You will not be disappointed in either the bluray standard or 3d versions.
B000FA6720|5.0|What a great love story, tears at the end though. It is sad to think this really can happen to anyone.
B001NLL0RW|4.0|Nothing like being a couple of years late, but I finally got around to reading this thriller.  Wow, I should not have waited so long.  I have the book in hardcover (used) but just could not find time to get around to it since I got my Kindle.  Thanks to a digital library loan I was finally able to check this exciting thriller out.<br /><br />I thought it was a fun exciting read.  Just what I expected and then SOME!  I already have the next book in this series on my Kindle and I will not wait years to read that one.  Was it over the top?  Yes, but it was an exciting thriller in line with [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]].  Yes, the character and locations change with each chapter, but I had no problems following along.<br /><br />It appears Rollins is setting events up for a final winner take all battle with the Guild in the near future.  Looking forward to it.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|My kids love this movie.  Great storyline, graphics are incredible and it's enough action for all ages.  Wish I would have seen this in the theaters.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was asked to read this book by a family member who really loved it, and so I complied. It was good and kept my interest, but I didn't think it was as &#34;great&#34; as she thought it was. By the end of the book, I was ready for closure. I'd had enough. The best thing about it was that it kept moving forward, and very quickly. The worst thing about it was the large cast of characters. I liked the main character who did the time travel back to the late 50s and early 60s to change history, but found some of the other characters  almost gratuitous.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time and that's no joke.  Christoph Walz and Jamie Foxx have incredible chemistry.  Brilliant!

I am a loyal fan of Brian Tracy, Robert Kiyosaki, and John Maxwell. This book really did it for me.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|the storyline was  good  However the writing itself gets to be a little tedious. The author could have shortened the book considerably by taking out all the oh mys!
0307970299|1.0|(audiobook) Not what it's advertised to be...The author has had many sad experiences in which she brilliantly describes, painfully.  Admittedly, I had tears in my eyes several times, and had to skip several tracks when she was talking in depth about her mothers death.  However, I thought I was getting an audiobook about a woman who hiked the PCT, not a book about tragic life experiences that will make you want to jump off a cliff!  I don't read or listen to heart-wrenching books but I'm an avid backpacker and a woman, and wanted to hear about that.<br /><br />So, once I got past her mother's death, her divorce and heroin addiction and she finally got on the trail, I thought, I'd finally hear about the backpacking from here on out.  And there were some of this, but there were a lot of the life drama inputted here and there, along with information showing that the author is not a very bright woman.  I'm not trying to be cruel here, but come on!  Of all the people she could of asked for a ride from at the gas station in Mojave, she chooses two men with a van!!!!  Is she stupid or just self-sabatoging?!?!  Then when she's camping with 6 men around her, you find out that she had packed a bunch of condoms!  Come on!<br /><br />By this point, I was kind of hoping she'd get eaten by a bear!<br /><br />I do want to note that another reviewer thought she was stupid for hiking alone.  I do not agree.  I do know that it's advised that nobody hikes alone, but men hike alone all the time and nobody thinks anything of it.  If men can hike alone, so can women, as long as the women are PREPARED, which this author was not!  I think it's OK that people (men and women) hike alone as long as they are prepared, have let someone know their schedule, when to expect them, etc.  They should have adequate protection (i.e. bear spray, knife, whistle...and condoms should not be needed as that's not the kind of protection I'm talking about.  Maybe that's where the author got confused...ha, ha).  But again, the author was anything but prepared.<br /><br />Anyway, the point to my review is that I didn't sign up for an audiobook about a sad life story, but a book about a woman's hiking experience on the PCT, which is what it was advertised as.But again, the author was anything but prepared.<br /><br />Anyway, the point to my review is that I didn't sign up for an audiobook about a sad life story, but a book about a woman's hiking experience on the PCT, which is what it was advertised as.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was a notch or two down on the riveting scale of the first book, but still very engaging.  However it didn't have a proper ending, just stopped.  I feel coerced (perhaps by the Capitol?) to read number 3.  Wasn't really planning on it, since I've heard it is the weakest of the trilogy, but now I definitely will read it.

B009FZFONO|4.0|the season started off fairly strong with a lot of promise, and it never quite delivered on that with a finale that was built up to be a bang and was nothing more than a fizzle. lots of new interesting characters were introduced and new settings that added up to promising a great new story, and it never quite got there. perhaps this is only the first half of a larger story that will pick up steam next season but i have my doubts. ever since frank darabont stepped away from running the show the drop in quality has been apparent, and i dont have much hope it will return to former glory unless he returns or someone of comparable talent takes over.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|Donald Fagen solo album sounds like it is going to be great but it is not catchy or inspires repeated plays. I have played this over and over again. It fall flat like MORPH THE CAT but with better CD cover design and album title.
B00136RZUI|5.0|i had originally bought this album years ago when it was first released in 2006 and enjoyed it for maybe a year or so until i either misplaced it or someone took it and i had not heard it since. i remember it being a quality floyd album with a few stand out classic tracks. i finally decided it was time to repurchase it and enjoy it again and boy was i not disappointed! it is better than i remember and is of such a high musical quality i can not recommend it enough to any music lover. most of the tracks are beautiful with gorgeous guitar play, fantastic supporting instruments, catchy lyrics, and still very nice vocals from dave himself even at his ripe old age his throat is still coated in honey. a floyd fan could not ask for a better post floyd album. it stands right up there with roger waters solo classics the pros and cons of hitchhiking and amused to death, both of which i would also highly recommend. on an island is a step above though and is perfect hybrid blend of classic floyd brought into the sound of modern music and production. dont miss this album!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 was full of unexpected twists. The Gov totally lost his mind killing up the Woodbury townspeople, Milton, Merle, and confused Andrea. The was pretty awesome!

1401322786|2.0|The Time Keeper<br />BOOK REVIEW<br /><br /> The latest in Mitch Albom's slew of signature thin, gracefully bound books filled with narrative on life, love, aging, and religion has arrived in the form of The Time Keeper, which although is beautifully simple and moving in some parts, lacks in substance.<br /> Albom's debut The Five People You Meet in Heaven was successful where this book is not. An extraordinary piece of literature, Five People is a must-read, one of the most moving books of its generation of novels. The Time Keeper is Albom's third work of fiction and reads like more of a skeletal outline for a novel than an actual book. Almost naked in its simplicity, the disjointed style of bolded sentences beginning new paragraphs of ideas hurts the novel more than helps.<br /> The book's premise is extremely ambitious. It begins with Dor, a man living in the dawn of mankind - think biblical, Tower of Babel-era Mesopotamia. Dor falls in love with and marries a girl named Alli, a romance that is meant to move much of the story along but is never fully developed, therefore leaving this element unsettlingly blank. Dor also invents time - technically he becomes the first person to ever invent a clock, which results in God's intervention and leaves Dor trapped in a cave for thousands of years.<br /> Albom then introduces us to two stories set in modern times - one of Sarah Lemon, a science-oriented outcast in high school, and the other of Victor Delamonte, an aging, wealthy businessman. These two characters are only somewhat likeable, their storylines only relatively interesting.<br /> Only at the end of the novel does Albom's true talent as a writer of some of today's most moving literature come to light: Dor is released from his cave in order to help the two time-obsessed characters find solace in their own lives, and in certain parts of the final chapters, as Dor helps Sarah and Victor heal, one might find oneself reflecting on how dominant time is over our lives today. Perhaps if this novel had been written better, with emotion fully coming to fruition, instead of as a plot summary with moments of color and light scattered among long passages of grey, it could have resulted in an extraordinarily moving tale.<br /> The ending leaves the reader with thoughts and plenty to take away, but lacks a feeling of emotional investment in the characters. Though exquisite in some parts, other choppy sentences stick out and distort the story's flow. Oddly enough, though written about how little humans value time, Albom doesn't spend enough time scoping out his characters. Sarah and Victor are never fully explained and both come off as obnoxiously shallow in parts, and Dor as a character seemed extremely opaque, with little depth to his characterization besides his love for Alli, which again was never fully explained.<br /> Albom has an amazing sense for the aesthetic, and this book has lovely patches of imagery and reflection inside of it. It contains important and relevant life lessons and for some might be a light and sweet delicacy. For this reviewer, it was more of a botched trial flavor of ice cream, with all the potential in the world but with the wrong ingredients.
B0000634EV|5.0|DOWN II is a great great HEAVY METAL ROCK album!!!!! if you liked the first DOWN album NOLA, you will love this one too!!!! All the songs are AMAZING!!!! Phil Anselmo did a great job with DOWN here!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!YEAH!!!!!!!

WHAT CAN I SAY, MAIDEN TOTALLY RULES!!!!! if you already love MAIDEN, you will love SOMEWHERE IN TIME, for sure!!!!!!!!! Common things will pass, but MAIDEN RULES FOREVER!!!!!!!!UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|...is that they never seem to get the timeline right.  I won't spoil the movie, but there is a GLARING hole in their logical timeline in the case that is never explained.  Sure it is a surprise--because it just don't make no sense!  (Intentionally bad grammar for emphasis used in place of an expletive).  If you are logical it will give you a headache.  Drink a few beers and enjoy watching Bruce beat up people.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was funny. However, the humor was quite mean or crude at times. For instance, a character named Amy (later revealed to have a different name) refers to herself as &#34;Fat Amy&#34; so other people wouldn't comment about her weight behind her back. Although this is outwardly funny, I'm not sure that is what young girls should have to resort to doing. I feel it leads to sacrificing self-worth and recognizing we are all beautiful in different ways.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Sorry Governor, but this version was more compelling and gritty than the original.  I still like both, however.  If you like shooting and science fiction, then you will too.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this DVD, not sure what I was getting. I love it!! I am on week 2 and yes the first couple of days were hard. I admit it, I am out of shape. I love that Jillian walks through it, helping to instruct just how to and how not to do the moves. She has 2 other girls on the DVD with her showing how to do amended moves for beginners and the tougher moves for those more advanced. I have already started shedding some weight. Friends have noticed that I am slimming down. I am so glad I bought this. I am determined to get in shape and Jillian is an awesome instructor for helping me to do so!!!

B000UZNSWM|4.0|My father served in the Korean War (that's right, I said war) and, like most veterans, he never uttered a word to his son's about his experience. I thought the time had come to venture beyond my basic understandings of that war therefore I relied on the David Halberstam brand as a vehicle to a better understanding. I was not disappointed in the final Halberstam effort preceding his untimely death. Halberstam would alternate throughout the book from battles on the ground to historical context and then back to the battlefield. Some reviewers did not care for this style but I came to understand how critical the historical background was to the full understanding of the war. After having read about the historical backdrop of Korea, China, Russia and the a United States, I viewed the war in the ground in much greater context. The historical foundation was absolutely essential to complete the mosaic of this peculiar war. Halberstam did seem to languish a wee bit too much towards the middle of the book regarding the historical precursors to the war. I was anticipating getting back to the battles more than I would have liked and that was the only reason I did not award this book 5 stars. That said, if I could have, I would have awarded this book 4 1/2 stars. Sadly, this book has allowed myself to have a greater understanding of my late father than I had when he was alive. Well worth the investment in time and $$$$$.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a good book. I haven't yet seen the movie so I hope its as good as the book. If you are a football or Eagles fan you will definitely enjoy this. LOL This book is different not like the usual love story type book I really did enjoy it and would recommend it plus it was easy to get into right from the start.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Chasing Mavericks was a fantastic film for everyone. The lead character showed excellent responsibility and determination to achieve his goal. Definitely one the entire family (not young children) will enjoy!
1400052181|5.0|I rather liked this book because it offered substantive learning for me, and was written in a manner which held my interest.  I appreciated the information regarding the various research, and valuable those cells were/are to our every day living.  Some time ago, I saw the documentary on this subject and was familiar with the information before reading the book.  However, It really hurts me to know that renowned institutions such as the Johns Hopkins Hospital, and others like it engage in what I believe to be underhanded, and scrupulous methods which rob some people of their rightful dues, because they don't know better.  And, they only didn't know better because of their situations.  I applaud Henrietta as well as Deborah, because they were willing to explore and learn even though the information was way beyond their formal educational level.  Lastly, kudos to the writer for her perseverance in exploring, and investigating through hardships to write such an excellent novel..

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I love anything Hobbit. My only fault with this movie is that it didn't cover the whole story. Once again, Hollywood has divided a great story into 2 parts, for the sake of money. Why make money off of one great story, when you can double the profits by splittling it in two.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I love this movie! It gives an awesome perspective on George, his experience in the Beatles and his experiences out of the band. Highly recommend to any Beatles or Harrison fan!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Absolutely loved the series.  It is wonderful to be able to go<br />back and watch particular episodes I enjoyed.  Scenery and<br />fashions were very authentic.  It was like<br />watching a movie rather than a TV series.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Heaven's Gate was panned when it was released. In retrospect it has become a cult classic,<br />in the manner of From here to Eternity, Apocalypse Now, Deer Hunter, The Wild Bunch, High Noon,<br />and Midnight Cowboy.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|No spoilers here so it is safe to continue reading :)<br /><br />Excellent book if you are looking for a fast read...  Just make sure you make some free time available as it will be hard to put this down once you have started it.  As most have mentioned, the ending is quite powerful in that it leaves you wondering about a lot of things.  For me personally, it is important that a story provide closure.  If an author is going to take the time to write a thought provoking story with fairly detailed characters who are dealing with a particularly difficult issue then I want closure or a definitive outcome at the end.  You won't get that with this book and are left really contemplating what decisions the main characters made as their lives continued.  All in all a good read.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Silo Saga is top-notch science-fiction, and is, for the most part, beautifully written. I can't believe this book was really self published. A thought-provoking story, with unexpected but believable plot twists that move the story along nicely. After reading The Road I had lost interest in post-apocalyptic stories, but this book has renewed my interest in that genre. I look forward to reading Mr. Howey's other books.

B00364K6YW|5.0|I like Jane Austen's books and her expression of humor.  I enjoy watching film adaptations of Austen's books.  What I like about this BBC series is Colin Firth as Darcy.  Firth plays brooding well, and he's especially pleasing to the eyes.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoyed following the strategy outside of court handling tough issues.  Also this is about the good guys winning almost all the time vs. the low lives putting it to everyone.  So it is not a downer.<br /><br />There is the occasional nod to the reality of gay relationships but it is not the main focus of the series and is handled so it is not any more of a distraction the hetero hi jinx.<br /><br />Adult fare due to sexual content (not the main focus but a consistent element) and the intellectual strategics of the lawyers and the campaign guru.  I find the series most enjoyable.
B000FC12ZA|5.0|I loved this story & it's profound meaning.<br />I don't care if the story is based on 100% real events or if it's fictional, or a mix of both (huge public controversy apparently), I thought it was a wonderful journey to share in.<br />I truly loved every page of this book!

0316223239|4.0|Jack is five. He lives in a single locked room with his Ma.<br />...<br />Warning -- minor spoilers below.<br /><br />Where to begin? Room packs a wallop of an emotional punch. You won't forget it, ever. To say this book is suspenseful is an understatement. It was so engrossing that I couldn't put it down! I was reading it on the way to an appointment, and literally sat down right where I was standing and read till I reached the end of the chapter. It's that good! I felt that Room had an important message about a mothers love for her son. It was also an interesting look at a type of Stockholm syndrome, and a brilliant analysis of a classic what-if: what if a human being was sheltered from the outside world all his life? How would he view society, view other people, or view the world?<br /><br />The author takes this scenario and brings it to brilliant life through her original premise, unforgettable characters, and amazing prose.<br /><br />But by no means is Room perfect. I felt that the book went downhill in the second volume after the characters left \\"Room\\" for the outside world. After an incredible few hundred pages, Room is reduced to the musings of a young boy trying to figure out the world and it into his \\"real\\" family. It's quality drama with extremely believable and realistic characters, but doesn't carry the emotional \\"umph\\" that the first part did. The suspense is all but lost, and Jack becomes a less then sympathetic character. You really begin to hate him after a while, but that is a testament to the brilliant writing capabilities of Emma Donoghue.<br /><br />But this is not to detract from the novel. It's a brilliant, completely original, heart-wrenching, unbelievably suspenseful, realistically characterized, haunting, eye-opening, beautiful look at family, a mothers love, and the world as seen from an outsider's eyes. It offers readers a chance to look inside the eyes of a boy who has never seen the world, and experience it all for the first time. Its an incredible character study, with characters you love to hate, or hate to love, and more. Room is a triumph from Emma Donoghue. Read it!<br /><br />Strong Recommendation! 4.5 Stars!an incredible character study, with characters you love to hate, or hate to love, and more. Room is a triumph from Emma Donoghue.

B009EFP278|4.0|British pop star and former British X-Factor runner-up Olly Murs delivers his first proper US debut via 2013's [[ASIN:B009EFP278 Right Place, Right Time (US Version)]], released via Columbia Records. Olly Murs proves to his 'new' audience he is a talented, possessing the looks, the voice, and much of the formula.  That said, Right Place Right Time is solid and enjoyable, but lacks the extra finesse to truly propel its star to the next level in the competitive US pop market.<br /><br />\\"Army of Two\\" is a good start that is just shy of being truly great.  The production ideas are great, particularly the strings and overall, Murs sings capably.  Singles \\"Heart Skips A Beat\\" (featuring Chiddy Bang) and \\"Troublemaker\\" (featuring Flo Rida) should feel like familiar favorites given their advanced release.  Both are groovy and compelling, but neither are either the 'second coming'. Even so, the are among the elite of the effort.<br /><br />\\"Dance With Me Tonight\\" has a nice retro-soul edge to the production, while \\"Hand On Heart\\" parallels US adult contemporary R&B with the big, pounding drums which have become a characteristic cue. \\"Hand On Heart\\" is one of the better cuts, though \\"Hey You Beautiful\\" is even stronger, borrowing both 80s and Maroon 5 cues.  Fun with a nice overall vibe, Olly Murs flirts without crossing any boundaries (\\"Whoa I feel your body calling out to me / don't deny this electricity / know there's something dirty on your mind / you don't have to lie, no / you don't have to lie...\\") The power of insinuation is enough and successful sometimes.<br /><br />\\"Right Place Right Time\\" is a bit of a letdown considering it is the title track.  The 'great' \\"Oh My Goodness\\" atones, with Murs once more relying on the past (neo-/pop- soul production) for inspiration.  Closing cuts \\"Loud & Clear\\" and \\"Dear Darlin'\\" again fall into the 'solid' and 'good' category without taking the next step.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B009EFP278 Right Place, Right Time (US Version)]] is a solid blueprint, if an imperfect one.  Murs and his producers/songwriters successfully provide plenty of contrasts like any pop effort.  The material is good, perhaps not as `memorable' as the best pop efforts. The rub is that Murs, although established in the UK, is only considered a 'newcomer with potential' in the US.  While  the album is a solid introduction, continual improvement will be a key in Murs's US fortunes/successes.  Verdict for the present?

B00B9366VO|5.0|In this documentary, in the form of a failing studio, we see the image of the dying reality music used to display for us all. Instead of computers and endless perfection, we used to play. Despite the flaws many players, singers and engineers faced in the past, somehow the music was always better, more authentic and much more substantial. If we screwed up a chord, misspoke a lyric, or just couldn't ruin what we as musicians thought was terrible, we'd be missing so much of what made music great: humanity. Sure, it's easier to use pro tools, much crisper and so easily usable to the masses, but it's within our own imperfections that we find our true selves, which is what music is supposed to be. In this film, sound city is one of the last to use old technology (reel to reel), to capture the musicians most adorned moments, but because of computers and endless accessabilty, sound city crumbles. But thanks to Dave growl of the foo fighters, he saves the console that recorded such masterpieces by fleet wood Mac, Neil young, nirvana, etc. we see how an engineer created its distinct sound, almost like the console itself lives and breathes. We see what it has meant to the industry and how even in this age of computer engineered music, true artistry can survive if you just take the time.

Bloody, great dialog, great acting, surprising moments and a great soundtrack. Sure, we've seen westerns with the same type of plots, but this is done in a fresh, realistic and hyper realistic format, which grabs you by the short hairs, tears them out and shows them to you. Love this movie

I had another adapter that used to work with the iPhone 4 but failed to do so with iPhone 5 because Apple changed the pins. If you need this for your car; look no further. It will get the job done!!!!
B009X010RU|5.0|worked just as advertised. One improvement would be to change it so protective cover can be opened and shut while charging cord is plugged in. change hinge to opposite side.
B0050DZN4K|2.0|Don't like the ui of this app.  It's hard to find sources and it keeps making me login to Google.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|we like all tim burton movies it was cute both my girls and i really liked it we watched it 4 times
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I like the orange color, bright and fun.<br />It's good for now.  I think with the bending back and forth over time it will wear out, especially if you use the landscape propped up mode a lot.  That bend is getting weaker already on mine and I have only had it about 4 months.<br />I'll use it until it gives out and then go with a bit better cover.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|i would give it all five stars but it keeps gliching. It likes to reset its self. it was an awesome game before that.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Facebook is facebook, it pretty much the same mobile version as the iPhone so no big surprise.<br />But there's a bug when you view a picture you can't click &#34;done&#34; to get out of it and go back to the newsfeed.<br />You have to keep hitting the back arrow sometime up to 20 times before it let's you go back.  So annoying that I avoid looking at pics in full mode (clicking on them).<br /><br />Developers of this app:<br />PLEASE FIX THAT BUG! I have had a few updates since - you'd think that would be a big issue that it would be fixed within 1 or 2 updates.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|This is not for those who want deep philosophical thought, cerebral dialogue , or long pauses. It is an action film built around a toy franchise. The action is fast and the scope of the effects is large.
B005K17RU0|3.0|... But not so much at being user friendly.<br />It only goes into portfolio  mode in one direction.  and you can't adjust the opacity of the radar in the map.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|What else is there to say. Murakami, again, fascinates me with his wonderfully odd stories. I can't wait to read the next books in the serie. Enjoy!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Wasn't as good as Beautiful Creatures, but almost. I would deffinatly recomend this book to anyone who has read the frist book.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|One of my most favorite movies of all time. Great to see it now in HD and provided in digital format. Sound and picture were absolutely fabulous!
0783229364|5.0|chose this rating because it arrived in time, new condition, and we wanted to get it in DVD...have it in vhs already.  A great movie for laughs.<br />Would order from this place again.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Good film adaptation of Seig Larsson's novel. A bit wordy at times as was the book but flows nicely and very suspenseful. Changes from the book didn't negatively affect the film's impact.Looking forward to the next film.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|movie arrived on time and in new condition.  Great sequel almost better than the first.  Get this in blu ray for sure.  Would recommend this to anyone.
B008602KQI|4.0|within the limits of translating a good to the screen, this was well done.  I highly recommend it for those who have not had the pleasure
B00947N6UG|5.0|great movie, arrived in new condition.  Would recommend this to anyone.  Lot of colors in this movie.  Good story plot to this movie...definitely a blu ray movie.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|MIB 3 is a great movie....sequels are sometimes not as good but not in this case.  Get this in blu ray a must.  Would recommend this to anyone.  Movie arrived in new condition and on time.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I first heard of this book from The View...I was interested when the writer was talking about her writing process...I got the book immediately and wasn't disappointed!! Love the series!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Having enjoyed many of Ken Follett's novels, I was excited to begin Fall of Giants.  Pillars of the Earth and World Without End were huge books, yet I didn't want either story to end.  Fall of Giants is well-researched with excellent character development, but I found it simply not as captivating as all the other books I've read by this hugely talented author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's 50 Shades! Of course it gets a great review...it is romantic yet you have the 'bad boy' in there!! Love this series!
B003H9M1QM|5.0|When it comes to family movies and fun, its hard to beat Disney. Great picture and great sound; these movies never get old!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It's 50 Shades! Of course it gets a great review...it is romantic yet you have the 'bad boy' in there!! Love this series!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie, I don't buy many Blu Ray movies; but, glad I bought this one. Very entertaining and kept my interest!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have watched it over and over and over!! I love every moment of this incredible play that has been made into a movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie with a easy to follow storyline for kids & positive message.... Can't go wrong with this one guys
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I play this on my Kindle Fire HD. The graphics are great. The puzzles are beautiful, fun, and perfectly challenging. Well worth my $2.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I've never had a movie have such an intellectual impact on me.  There was so much depth and philosophical stimulus.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I THINK Grey`sAnatomy is the best series I`'ve  ever seen.The actors are so.good at what thy do.you feel like your right there with them.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This is a movie to watch when you really hate the work you do.  Some of the best and most riveting dialogue ever, in any form, film or book.  This is an utterly depressing movie, very realistic and captures the corporate soul, or lack thereof, perfectly.  The cast is phenomenal, Al Pacino totally rocks it too, man they must have loved having a script like this to work with.  One of my all-time favorite movies!
B008B68J2G|4.0|My daughter loved this toy. She played with it a lot. It is cute. It will go with any regular-sized fashion doll (like Barbie or Brats or whatnot). The coffee accessories are adorable.
0807014273|5.0|This is a great book to find out how some people can overcomhardship and tragedy in their lives, while other people just &#34;give up&#34;
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoyed this game quite a bit, although the ending came much faster than I had expected.  Felt almost like the writers had a great storyline going then weren't sure where to take it, so they just threw in a poor ending.  It likely won't take long to finish it, but it was okay fun while it lasted.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I read the hunger games I really wanted to read all of the books .this book is not all about fighting and death it is a little bit of  fighting love kind of book. Ps. The best book ever on the face of the world. Pss I am  a 5th grader
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing! Sauciest book I've read in a while. Couldn't put it down. A real page turner....Highly recommend to all my lady friends :-)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games so much I'm going to read it again .ps if you read the third book you will problem cry a little bit
B00992CF6W|5.0|All right its still not as good as the PC or XBOX editions but is still pretty good. I downloaded this to our family's tablet and everyone enjoys playing this. We have competitions to see who can build the biggest and best house or other stuff. I would definitely recommend it for any family. Its worth the price.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We received this in great time and watched it. I liked the movie and pleased with purchase. I would recommend.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is simply one of the best book I ever read. It is written in such a realistic way it was hard to believe that this book is a fiction. Just in the end I felt something, and after finishing turned to internet for check my guess.<br /><br />I think I loved everyhing about the book: the story, the language, the style, the length...<br /><br />It is so realistic that when my son told his teacher that this is a fiction, the teacher told &#34;Read it again! You are wrong&#34;... And believe me the problem is not the teacher, this is the book that simply captures readers heart.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Great information to help you improve your food choices. The author did a tremendous amount of research and made it an interesting read. If you needed a reason to stop eating convenience foods, read this book.
B002RI99IM|1.0|Like someone already said &#34;Stating the obvious, solution to none&#34;. It is a total waste of time for me. I really got more and more angree with every page I ever read. Many words, many trivials things... but you continue to read it in attempt to get to the core, that may be I'm missing something.<br /><br />This is not just dissappointing book, this is upsetting book. I wonder how it became so popular and got good recommendations? Is it something in this book that is new for anyone?? Does anyone really think that mathematical models are perfect and free of any flaws?  Everyting is not perfect!, and yes mathematical models are not an exception and they will work only in certain conditions... while in all the others they will not.<br /><br />So if you already know that 2+2=4 and that not everying is perfect, don't waste your time. Zero information for few days read effort!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story and acting as usual. Wonderful recreation of the 1920's. An Irish Republican can give fine advice, thank goodness!
B00643IG80|5.0|this is one of the best inspirational movies.- Richard Dreyfuss made a remarkable performance as a music teacher with all of his moments  .
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a remarkable and moving story. Given the horror of war per se and the atrocities committed therein, it is more than uplifting to know that some of those called by their country to fight can do so with honor.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A compelling insight into a truly great American with a powerful vision of duty, love and a sense of accountability.  Thank you for your service! God Bless!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the whole series and am satisfied with the ending. That being said, I didn't feel that it was the page turner that the previous 2 books were.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I don't have cable so this allows me to watch the best cable shows. A little later than other people but a lot less expnesive
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Stumbled upon this author by accident and was happily surprised to discover a talent new to me, well written in a suspenseful way great characters well defined, well worth a read.
1455526959|2.0|The same old story line with some boring new additions. Harry (who can easily be terminated from the LAPD) continues to demean his superiors and violate policy. His superiors continue to be inferior thinkers and arrogant to boot. His daughter is of course the stellar child who is mature beyond her age. Michael Connelly is laughing all the way to the bank as he rakes in money using the same formula year after year.
B00AEBB932|5.0|There are only a few westerns that can rightfully be called classics, and this is close to the top. From the opening scene of the rider appearing between the horns of an elk to the classic showdown it never misses a beat.
B00CDT5YZC|5.0|This show and bobs burgers are not available for us to watch and I would like to know why its frustrating to pay for everything and then not available. Please someone answer me.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an excellent book! It should be required to read by every American.  It really puts things in perspective and you realize the sacrifices these men make for our country.  Their courage and strength leaves me speechless.  Words will not do this book justice, you will just have to read it and you will understand.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read this series because of all the publicity and hype. As I got into the second book I realized this series is just another romance series, popular because of the kinky sex. I'm not a prude, but found my self flipping through the sex scenes because they became predictable, not that titillating. I read the third book because I was just interested enough in the story line that I wanted to find out how it turned out.
0810979772|5.0|My 9 year old daughter is thrilled to have this Do-It-Yourself book added to her Diary of A Wimpy Kid collection!
1932735410|5.0|This book is the &#34;drinking from the fire hose&#34; book of PMP Exam Prep.  I was amazed at the information and the easy, straight-forward presentations, quizzes and questions.  It really helped me prepare for the exam and I am now a PMP!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this is a nice book for studentsto read, especially the kids who going to college. I appreciate charile's music taste.
B006GLM5EQ|4.0|Despite somewhat hastily written dialogue and some rather juvenile characters, this teenage novella-turned-drama still manages to pull together a pretty decent story arc. Some of the main characters are, to me, unlikable, but the show explores both social and moral questions through a fusion of the occult and southern charm that makes up for their unlikeableness. Overall, I found it quite entertaining; but don't take the show too seriously, because it IS still a cheesy romance story.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook on my Kindle Fire is ok.  It has to download to be current after I open it up.  I still haven't; figured out how to make comments and have them show up on people's posts.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Best KC album! She is definitely BACK and better than ever! So excited for this album! Some songs are a bit cheesy - but for the most part, it's a great showcase of her talent!
B004GYY714|5.0|Considering we live where radio reception is poor, this is an awesome way to find shows that I like to listen too.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I was very impressed with the humor and silliness of this movie. I am also happy with the ending. My whole family enjoys watching this movie together--everyone from the age of 2 to the age of 50! Fun family movie!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is ok.  I like it.  I haven't gotten to the more challenging puzzles yet, but am looking forward to them.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|A fun romp down a memory I am not sure I had. Great fun for you and your family and my cat liked it also .
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Fearless was a pleasure to read and learn from. I'm a better person for having read it, and appreciative of the true sacrifices of those who it's about.<br /><br />Truly beyond a five star rating!<br /><br />Geoff
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Inspirational. No other ways to describe it. Deep, and true. Everybody deep down somewhere inside of them is exactly like Charlie.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Where is season 3? Suspenseful,  very good easy viewing. Sad story for the girl. I really enjoy it. Try it out
0060594896|5.0|i read a couple of pages every day,,, wonderful book ,easy reading  would suggest every one who is networking marketing to own this book
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I found it rather long in some parts, but I suppose this is expected when making a trilogy out of this smaller work. (Smaller than LOTR). The special effects didnt disappoint. The action scenes were also quite entertaining. Not much excessive violence as I can recall. Good background story development that increases enjoyment of LOTR, and not just the obvious background story of the discovery of the Ring.<br /><br />I mainly took off one star just for the length. It really should have been made into a slightly longer single movie, not a trilogy. But good entertainment no doubt.
B001DF68MA|5.0|Came ahead of time and easy to assemble. It's a good design and fits comfortably on my bike. Great product!
B009YQJ322|5.0|Having read the comics I thought this version was much more in line with the feel and grittyness of the comic then the first one.
1416563156|5.0|I loved this book so much I bought a second copy for my son. It lets you enter the world of Henry Jones Jr from when he was a young lad through the three films with a generous portion of new material in between. I am a stickler for detail, and the detail is there. There are passports, photos, tickets, newspaper clippings, and other things collected by Indiana Jones as he traveled around the world. Every Indiana Jones fan should have this book!<br /><br />i loved this book s
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I Haven't read the books.  But for me this movie was a sweet and fun romp thru a new and interesting re-telling of much beloved childhood characters.  Loved how Rabbit was from Australian and Santa was Russian.  The voice acting was way better then I expected.  Would recommend this movie to anyone from 6-60.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series so much and having to wait for the next season was a pain, so I bought it and have already watched it twice.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|Having never played any of the video games I really loved both movies.  This one brought the creepy factor home in a really fast paced and interesting way.
B0000549B0|5.0|This was only the second movie I found to begin my Classic Collection.  But it is one that no collection should be without.  James Stewart at his finest.  Old and young will adore this movie.  It arrived in the condition advertised in only a few days.  I would have paid a lot more for it, but luckly I found the right seller who had it at a fair price.  I will continue to check out your website.
B005CRQ3RK|1.0|The book was amazing from the first word and the dialogue and setting was amazing and the characters sound so realistic actually  sounds just like me and my little brother!  ,  ---- Amy
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|The movie DVD arrived quickly, and in better condition than I expected.  I am in the process of building my old movie collection and this is a fine start.  I look forward to buying more classics from you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app for sharing ideas. So many talented folks willing to share creative decorative ideas, receipes, fashion, travel advice...anything. Happy pinning!!
B0068PHS5Q|5.0|The story was fascinating.  It took me a while to get into the story, but wow, once I did, I could not put the book down. Murder, incest - you name it. Brilliantly written and containing lots of truths about life.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I look forward to each and every one of his books.  My favorite book is Under the Dome but all are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I really recommend it everyone it is like temple run but better lots of characters to unlock and lots of boards
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was very good. It keeps the readers interest.  Each page into it, it was hard to put the book down. The ending was fantastic and unexpected!
B00908DDZM|5.0|MACKLEMORE'S ALBUM IS AMAZING! Please buy this you guys because it comes right away and in great packaging. It is the cheapest and easiest way to get this amazing album!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I am a beginning photographer and I was asked to photograph an anniversary party. I knew my standard flash on my camera would not cut it for the event. I researched several different options and chose this one due to the price and the other reviews. I wasn't ready to spend hundreds of dollars on a flash quite yet. This does an amazing job and I was very pleased with the pictures from the event! (as were the clients!)
B0002858YS|5.0|I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who loves the killers as much as I do! It came in great packaging as well!
1419703692|5.0|Any fan of the DK franchise should own this!!!! any fan of Batman should own this!!!! the pictures alone are worth having on your coffee table or at least in your collection. the behind the scenes stories on how stunts were conducted is also pretty interesting if your passion for film high.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I like Star Trek the original series. I grew up watching Kirk, Spock and Bones. Watching it now I see how far advanced they were and how this series influenced our modern technology. Never get tired of watching it over and over.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|Hubby and the boys loved this movie- Mommy- not so much. It's about different video game characters and the beginning is a little harsh as the characters in Ralph's game don't like him. If you have boys- they'll love it! If you have girls- maybe choose a different title.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|What u see is what u get.big hunk of metal for chopping through s***.part axe.part pry bar.part knife.part tank.it's not for pussys that think it's too heavy or for those who think its like using a canon as a fly swatter.it'll take some abuse but it's not indestructible.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I was expecting so much more! It's like 40 year olds who act and talk like 20 year olds. F- bombs are dropped every two minutes. The movie was more nagging than funny. It actually put me in an annoyed mood. I was hoping to be laughing!
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I loved listening to Boz Scaggs' early work in college ('Silk Degrees'), and reconnected with his work when 'Speak Low' came out a few years ago - that's an album I can - and do - listen to over and over again and never grow tired of it. And since 'Speak Low' came out, I've been collecting more of his earlier work. So when he released 'Memphis' I didn't need to think twice. And he still delivers. He's one of the most played artist lists on my iPod.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Ryan Reynolds makes this movie!! It's a standard chick flick. I've seen it tons of times and still was willing to pay for a rental. Always makes me smile. Premise: Sandra Bullock is an uptight workaholic who is about to be deported back to Canada- but she convinces immigration that she's marrying her assistant Reynolds. You can see how this plays out- they end up really falling in love! Betty White is also in the movie- an added bonus.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Some of the snippets leave you wondering where they are going. Hopefully they will be picked up in the next volume. Well written, but a little disconnected. Style from Robert Jordan?
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I am really impressed how they pulled this of to make a movie out of a great broadway show. The beginning is absolutely amazing. The acting and singing is marvelous. This is one og the greatest movies I have seen in a long time.
B000X2H8G4|1.0|They way they describe it was not what I got - it hardly amplifies - you can do with the static, but if you are looking for something that helps with low to moderate hearing loss, pass this product up!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Once you get past the fantasy of disappearing into the past ... A book that keeps you wondering &#34;what if?&#34; Good characters, good research.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Really functions well on my kindle. Helps alot better in choosing versus using finger. Rubber tip. Would recommend. Has three tips
B00899E5B4|4.0|Joe gets better with age like fine wine.  I'm also going to purchase the DVD that goes with this Album.  There is additional music there.  I feel his best is yet to come!
B00B0NDF26|5.0|It's Tegan and Sara but with a n 80's sort of feeling.  Fun songs move a little away from their darker side, but I love it nonetheless.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The first half of season 3 was fantastic. The second half was ok, with &#34;Clear&#34; being an excellent episode among a bunch of poorly conceived ideas. The finale failed to wrap up many storylines and was so-so.
0385366752|5.0|I play audio books in the car, and I found myself inventing errands and taking the long way arouond so I could listen to this book.  My daughter is now listening to it.  Her family has gone to DisneyWorld for spring vacation, and before they left she was bemoaning the fact that she has to go a whole week without finding out what happens next.  Highly recommend.
0393088774|5.0|Krugman is super good, keeps up opposition to wrongheaded conservatives on stimuluii needed, and I believe has changed US leader's view on operation of the economy.
1611761921|5.0|The Reacher audio books are probably my favorites to listen to.  Lots of action and plot twists that are perpetually surprising.  Nothing predictable here!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|challenging enough but addictive.  I am comparing it to the ipad version.  It is a little too easy.  This one gives you a challenge.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A good read.  I liked how the story went between James & Lydia before they finally came together. A very nice ending that I wasn't sure would happen. Not quite as predictable as you might think.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I love this group. Nate and the guys have a lot of talent. I need to buy their debut album as well.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game. It is a good fun game to play with friends and I would recommend the game to people.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really identified with the characters, and grew to like them very much. This is how I usually judge a book, by how much I feel for the characters. I'm really glad it didn't end badly for Charlie, because I was really getting worried about him. Now Icahn watch the movie to put faces with the people in the book. I hope they did a good job!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I like Facebook a lot but you need to do something about the games from zynga they have a lot of problems with them. I really like Farmville but it will not play on my kindle fire and I don't know why. These games pick up a lot of virus's in them that mess up my computer.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I'm not overly fond of McConaughey as an actor, but I thought this movie seemed interesting enough to give it a chance. Overall I was happily surprised by it, the story of a high priced attorney who seems to not have any moral fiber, but finds his limits in his most recent case defending a man accused of assault. The dynamic with Marisa Tomei plays well into the story line, if a little over the top in their relationship. It is a solid drama, maybe not edge of your seat worthy, but above average overall and worth your two hours I would say.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|this is just too cool. My niece showed it to me and I was hooked. The list of songs is also very nice so you can go back and order later.  Very nice app indeed!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|You can't help but be a fan of such a creative series! My kids are loving these movies -- boys and girl -- and watch them pretty regularly. The animation of the &#34;robots&#34; transforming is truly amazing. Every one in the trilogy is exciting and humorous. My daughter is now enamored (read: obsessed) with Camaros... especially yellow ones with black stripes LOL.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl...I understand why it was on the bestseller list for over 40 weeks.  The story surprises the reader and the story-<br />telling format gives insight to the minds of the characters.  What an ending!
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Hotel Transylvania takes the bite out of the vampire/werewolf genre of movies. My kids think it's hysterical and are not afraid at all of the concept of vampires in this movie. Also love the little message that being different is OK and we can all get along...
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|The humor is thoughtful and funny because of how well it simultaneously captures what is difficult and wonderful about love, life, parenthood, and relationships.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I didn't really want to see this but my 11-year-old daughter did... and I am SO GLAD WE BOUGHT IT! All of my kids (7 and 11, boys and girl) LOVE this movie and watch it over and over again. Such a great combination of believing in childhood &#34;guardians&#34; and growing up. There are scary-ish parts and exciting parts and sad-ish parts and loving parts. GREAT FLICK!
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I love ONEREPUBLIC!! But this is one of their best albums ever! Love every song ! This album is so awesome love just listening to it over and over, and it has 17 tracts! I highly recommend this album. Especially if you are a fan of ONEREPUBLIC Great Music!!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Awesome book. Witty and touching, I wish this book had a sequel it was so good. Definitely worth the time to read, wish this author wrote more books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow this game is awesome.Its the most funist game ever!!!All of my other games are boring but this one is cooler!!!<br /><br />  $  $<br />  L<br /><br />  O
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|With Jesse back in the band, I highly doubted it would be a bad album, even slightly mediocre. And sure enough, I was right. It's great! Very heavy. And it's wonderful to hear Jesse back to his heavy roots, as opposed to more what he delivered with &#34;Times of Grace&#34;, which is also a superb side project of theirs.<br /><br />Not to say I didn't like Howard. In fact, I dare say that I like Jesse AND Howard equally, for different reasons. But the last album Howard was on, the self-titled album released in 2009, was pretty tame. I wasn't as excited about that album as I was about all the others.<br /><br />So, on that note, if you like the heavier side of KSE, and you like Jesse as their singer, you'll like this album for sure.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Bought it online, so didn't actually see or touch it. However, the photo showed the grain on the material & sold me. Liked it even more when it arrived. Sleak. Strong in construction (I'm on my Kindle everyday...that can be a lot of ware on the rotating apparatus); it's not frail. Like the color, too. (bought the orange).<br /><br />I get a lot of compliments.<br /><br />The price is right. If a Kindle owner wants to protect his/her unit, get this.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An extremely well-written, analytical summation of the author's experience.  A must read!  Not another near-death experience account.  This one stands alone

B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD was just what I needed to put me in the Christmas spirit!  I played it many times during the holiday season.  You will love Cold December Night; it is my understanding that Michael Buble' and a friend wrote this song.  I hope it becomes a classic!
B000FA675C|5.0|I have read this book several times. I recently got my Kindle edition because it was free. I'm rereading it again. Some of the reviewers argue about Dan Brown pushing fiction as fact. My recollection is that he never said it was totally fact. But, some of his book is based on recently researched  church/biblical history - in particular by Princeton's Elaine Pagels, a scholar who specializes in the political history of the Bible. The book has strong appeal with me primarily because it has caused me to think about whether my faith is based on a relationship with God or simply based on theological inventions of book authors or the personal interpretations of priests.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This is a good album for showcasing Susan Boyle's talent.  The draggy rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow prompted me to give it a 4-star rating instead of 5.  Other than that, I really like the CD.

0670026603|5.0|Me Before You by Jojo Moyes, is a sensitive journey into the life of a caretaker, a disabled, active young man, and the love and understanding they find in each other. Lots of twists and turns, but all leading to one end...

B0033H7VI6|5.0|Awesome knife. Added some cordage on it and man it feels nice. It's a huge workhorse and heavy. But once you start batoning with it outdoors at speed, the weight won't bother you at all. With the added pouch on the sheath, you can easily add your multitool, ranger bands, caribenor, and firesteel inside it for a nice tight fit.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|you'll love this album.  It's awesome.  It combines  Bolton's soulful singing with some of the best songs of the past.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|Terrible and cheap certainly. Don't bother. After a few uses it's totally useless and if not careful, could potentially harm yourself while using it as well. Very small item.

B0054TKB8I|4.0|I loved the movie this show is based off of, and was hesitant to watch a remake, especially done by MTV. This is me eating crow because I think they did a great job updating it for modern times. Most supernatural shows in this vein take a few episodes to allow their audience a chance to dip their toes into the mythology, but TW is only 12 eps long, so they start out with a wallop.<br /><br />Swift recap: Scott McCall is a young happy-go-lucky teenage boy (16 or thereabouts when the show begins) who is bitten by something while searching for a dead body in Beacon Hills Nature Preserve with his best friend Stiles Stilinski. By the end of the first ep, Scott and Stiles (therefore we the audience) know he was bitten by werewolf, thereby becoming one, and this sets up the central mystery for the rest of the season: Who was the werewolf who bit Scott and is it the same werewolf terrorizing the town?<br />Somewhat less successfully, the writers also introduce a Romeo and Juliet scenario by having Scott fall in love with Allison Argent, a member of an ancient werewolf hunting family. Other characters are introduced and quickly cement their place in the story, but the focus is on Scott and his transition from human to wolf, and the ensuing chaos stemming from The Bite.
0143121316|4.0|Reading this book is like being a fly on the wall in the meeting rooms where some of the most important decisions of the 20th century were made. Actually, it's better than that. It's like having a seat at the table - Kissinger's seat. But it's only partly a memoir. It's also a lengthy reflection over the place of China in the world, written by a man who spent a large part of his adult life thinking about and dealing with the Chinese. You may disagree with his politics, but it's hard to argue against his immense experience with the world's most populous nation. And it's a wealth of experience that we are well served to learn from. Buy and read - and tremble!

0553801473|5.0|Book 5, A Dance with Dragons a Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin, continues the fascinating and well-written saga in the Game of Thrones series. It is quite a long book, but worth reading, so plan to spend some time getting deeper into the complex and sometimes perplexing series. Time yourself, it's hard to put down so remember to eat and sleep

B0063IH60K|4.0|A fun game.  I just wish there were more variations.  I had a solitaire game on my b&w Kindle that had about 8 choices.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I am very happy with this case.  It is sturdy and does what it says.  I really like the fact that it automatically turns the kindle on and off when I open and close it.  It's a nice color (i bought the purple one) and texture and has a nice, soft, protective lining. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the weight. It does make the kindle heavier.it was a good buy for the price.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is one of those thriller movies which keeps you on the edge of your seat. It will get repeated viewings even though the outcome is known. Excellent video and audio.

Great Quality for $30 bucks it's a steal!

1439127727|5.0|Ms. Gibbs's and Mr. Duffy's book portrays the all-too-human relationships between former and sitting U.S. Presidents from Herbert Hoover through the first few years of Barack Obama's tenure. What many Americans take for granted is the repeated, amazing, near-seamless transition of one person handing over power to another even if they are political polar opposites. Consider the statistical tie in the highly contentious Bush/Gore race. We eventually transferred power to the opposite party without there being civil war or blood in the streets. That in itself says something about our country. Anyone who has been President of the United States understands maintaining the dignity of the Executive Office trumps an individual's personal desires. The authors show how even presidents of opposite political philosophies have put aside their differences to help our country and usually this was done without the public being aware it was occurring.<br /><br />The book covers many key events in which ex-presidents helped sitting presidents. Feeding the war-torn victims after World War II, the Marshall Plan, the Bay of Pigs debacle, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, the Clinton Impeachment proceedings, 9/11, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake are but a few of the topics reviewed. One thing that did stand out to me was Presidents Nixon and Carter seemed to be especially highlighted by the authors for less than admirable character flaws.<br /><br />The ability of the living ex-presidents to aid any sitting Chief Executive when called to action is a wonderful testament to the caliber of men who have attain the Office. Not only does the book show our leaders as men with strengths and flaws, but it also reveals that politics and paranoia as well as hateful factions in both parties have always been part of our country's character. The authors admire certain actions done by the leaders, but no president is placed on a pedestal. All of them, rightly, receive a few critical raspberries. People who believe either FDR or Ronald Reagan could do no wrong will be upset by how the book portrays some of their nastier qualities. The passage of time and top-notch research, such as Ms. Gibbs's/Mr. Duffy's work, allows us to get a better measure of the people and events. It is history that is not only entertaining, gossipy, and great reporting but also helped me feel proud of our country.rightly, receive a few critical raspberries.

B008OHV5C8|5.0|I was lucky enough to be invited to a concert where Halloween, Alaska performed. They were good but David King was awesome. I was then even luckier and got  to see The Bad Plus at the Dakota here in Minneapolis...those guys were terrific.  This is a great CD... Pound for Pound, the first track, is gorgeous. Ethan Iverson's playing is intoxicating... amazing it is legal, it is so good.

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|I've always been interested in the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; goings on on stage, or the music business in general. This is a real interesting look at some of the most famous acts of the 70&#34;s and 80&#34;s with the stories and interviews regarding the then famous &#34;Sound City&#34; studios. WOW, a lot of great acts recorded there and Dave Grohl was the perfect person to weave this story. I particularly think that young people today could benefit by seeing how GOOD ANALOG music was made before the dreaded mp3 came to be.  That Neve console...a piece of art in and of itself. Thanks for rescuing it Dave and placing it in that beautiful studio of yours! Sit back and enjoy, especially some of the live videos at the end of the movie featuring Stevie Nicks, Paul McCartney (and yes, his voice actually WORKS with this song), Rick Springfield and others. Even if you are not a huge rock fan, but an audiophile or just a lover of good analog recorded music, watch this!
B0000047CX|5.0|Great music from 2 musical greats. Girl from Impanema is a classic.  If you like music you will love this.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I downloaded this app to my T-mobile MyTouch (android) which had a 2GB card in it with at least 500MB of free space. I immediately got a message stating my memory was low and I needed to delete some stuff. My voicemails could not be downloaded, I couldn't send or receive text messages and experienced other problems. I uninstalled the app and the low memory messages disappeared. I replaced the card with an 8GB card which had at least 6.5GB of free space. I  downloaded the app again, and the low memory messages immediately appeared again along with the same problems I had before with voicemails, text messages, etc. I never could even open the app either. I was forced to uninstall the app again.<br /><br />I hope this is fixed quickly, because I really would like to be able to use this app on my phone. If it is fixed, I will promptly edit this review. I love the Kindle app that I downloaded to my laptop. It works wonderfully. I had very high hopes for the app for my phone.

0061733199|5.0|Lofty Wiseman is a true survival expert, not like those guys you see on television who have a few credentials but seem unbelievable. Lofty taught survival skills in the SAS and is known as the &#34;go to guy&#34; on the subject. I bought this book because my winter project this year was to prepare &#34;bug-out-bags&#34; for my wife, daughter, and myself and I wanted some professional input.<br /><br /> We live in an area known as &#34;tornado alley&#34;. We also have springtime floods and winter snowstorms that could possibly leave my family without shelter, food, heat or medical help. When I saw what happened during Hurricane Katrina, I wanted to make sure my family wouldn't suffer because I left them unprepared.<br /><br />This book not only teaches you what to keep in your GOOD (get out of Dodge) BAG, but also has chapters on First Aid and what items to keep for emergency use and what kind of plants you can and cannot eat to survive outdoors. The author also includes how to survive in any climate and living in the midwest, we have just about any climate you can imagine throughout the year. After reading this book and preparing, I finally put it in my bag - just in case.
0385366752|4.0|Wow!  So many wists and turns, mostly in Amy's mind.  I wanted Nick to have more backbone but his sinister wife did put him in many tough situations.  The story kept me engaged while grinding my teeth.

B000FCJZ3G|5.0|This is a most informative product regarding our relationship to money, wealth and wealth creation It basically predicates that you cannot achieve anything outside unless it first happens within. Unless one first has the correct mindset it is impossible to create and hold wealth.I will have no hesitation in recommending it to my acquaintances and buying it for each one of my children.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly offers what it calls a &#34;seamless&#34; transition from Reader when the time comes, and a good experience thereafter. I found it to be a fairly transparent substitution process, and only regret that Feedly has succumbed to the common trend toward a decorative UI. I am grateful that at least some of the gimcracks can be banished through the settings; the rest I can live with. If I had been allowed more control over appearance and behavior I would have awarded 5 stars. If you use Reader, this should be high on your list of positive alternatives. If you are used to another news reader, there's probably no compelling reason offered by Feedly to adapt to something new.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I love the Supernatural tv series, the entire cast, and all their emotional termoil. If you haven't seen the show I recommend starting with season one.

B002JVWRAO|4.0|Season 5 wasn't my favorite, but I love the entire tv series. The one very much deals with heaven and hell and I have reservations, but I love these characters so much that I just kept chugging along with each show.
0670026557|5.0|Although 2013 is still young, I predict that Give and Take, by Wharton professor Adam Grant, has a great chance of being the best book I've read all year, for three reasons: it's inspirational, it's instructional, and it's solidly research-based.<br /><br />The premise of the book is quite simple: the world comprises three types of people: givers, takers and matchers. Which type tends to be most successful? Although we've all been raised on the homily that it's better to give than to receive, the bad news is that the left side of most bell curves is populated by givers, those who contribute more to others than they expect in return. Quite simply, they do less for themselves, people take advantage of them, and they are prone to burnout.<br /><br />But the real surprise is that the right side of bell curves is also a givers' neighborhood. Combining extensive research with inspiring examples, Grant shows us how and why successful givers do well for themselves at the same time that they contribute so much to others. Successful givers approach four principal aspects of relationships differently. The four aspects are networking, collaborating, developing talent and communicating.<br /><br />Successful givers are excellent networkers, but so are a lot of takers and matchers. The difference is that successful givers proactively do things without expectation of return, creating goodwill and possibly setting an example that may be contagious. One of the excellent tips in this chapter is the suggestion to revive dormant connections. The benefit is that when most people tap into their network for help, their strong ties are trusting and disposed to help, but their weak ties have more diverse information. People you haven't talked to in a long time combine the assets of strong ties and weak ties.<br /><br />Givers are also excellent collaborators, quick to help others in a team environment and without spending too much time worrying about who gets credit. They tend to demonstrate what the National Outdoor Leadership School calls expedition behavior, putting the needs of the mission and the team ahead of your own. In the long run, this behavior increases their prestige and the willingness of others  to help them when they need it.<br /><br />Givers are also excellent at spotting talent, because they're not worried about creating rivals who may outshine them. Also, because they tend to assume competence and talent on the part of others, they may be generating self-fulfilling prophecies. I found this chapter to be rather long on anecdote and thin on evidence, but the next chapter made up for it.<br /><br />For me the meatiest chapter covered the successful practices that givers follow in communicating with others, in presenting, selling, and negotiating. Successful givers ask more meaningful questions and have an effective mix of confidence and humility in their advocacy. They also tend to be good at perspective-taking, which is the cognitive equivalent of empathy: instead of feeling what the other person is feeling, they are adept at thinking what they're thinking. In studies, people with high empathy do worse in creating value, because they are more apt to give the other person what they want. Those high in perspective taking are better at coming up with creative ideas to give both sides more of what they want.<br /><br />The second section of the book is for those who are too giving, and tend to fall at the bottom of the success distribution because they get taken advantage of and exhaust their energies serving others rather than themselves. The key insight is that self-interest and other-interest are not opposite points on a single line; they are separate axes on a graph. Those who give too much have a high score for other-interest, and a low score for self-interest. Successful givers are at the top right of the graph, combining a high other-focus with high self-interest. As a result, they are in better control of their giving, seeing itas a positive choice rather than an obligation, and being more proactive in allocating their  giving time and energy.<br /><br />If you get inspired by Grant's book, what you'll really want to know is how to become a more successful giver. The Catch-22 is that giving has to be sincere it it's to work, and if you try to make it strategic it's not sincere. I do think, however, that if you begin changing your behavior for strategic purposes, and start doing more for others, two positive things may happen. First, regardless of the motive, you're contributing to the sum total of benefit and happiness. Even more important is that your attitude may begin to catch up with your actions. The mind does not like cognitive dissonance, so if we're acting in a giving manner we will begin to see ourselves more as givers, leading to a virtuous circle. The book finishes with ten suggestions for becoming more of a giver--I'll keep you posted on how it works.<br /><br />The one weakness in the book is that in some of the chapters, as mentioned above, there was less evidence than it seemed on first reading. You get pulled in to the inspiring stories, but on closer reading you don't find enough evidence to be able to make up your mind whether those examples are the rule or the exception.<br /><br />Despite this, the message in Grant's book is so powerful that I give it five stars. But it's not a gift--it's truly earned. The book itself is a gift to anyone who reads it, and to countless others who may be on the receiving end of their stepped-up giving.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I may be subject to some confirmation bias, because although I don't know Adam Grant personally, I found out about the book through the very complimentary article profiling him in the New York Times Magazine.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The story is well written and flows smoothly. Great action. Katniss is a very likeable character and you are always rooting for her to triumph.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fun to read and I even laughed out loud numerous times.  I thoroughly enjoyed Tina's style of writing and letting us in to some of the stories behind the scenes.
B007SGM084|5.0|It had my attention through all of the books. I never wanted to stop reading. Very hard to ever put them down.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Loved it. Village/villagers quite believable. Beautiful scenery and surroundings. Caviezel plays himself. Pretty much the same character as in 'person of interest', perhaps a little more vulnerable/less sarcastic in this. A little shaky pacing to start...and one oddly placed 'f-bomb' in the first few minutes, then it settles down to a reasonable pace. I always enjoy finding a keeper like this among the b-movies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app! Easy and convenient! I even used it to figure my income tax this year. No regrets!
B0093FNZT6|5.0|I chose five stars because I enjoyed it very much, Eban's journey was thought provoking and in some way a relief.  I have read quite a few books on different people's near death experiences and this experience solidified for me how our God takes the soul to a place and level that resonates with what their personality and talents etc can cope with.  The read was of a very intellectual nature because he is a neuro surgeon and scientist.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I just finished re-reading this book. I totally enjoyed the book the first time but didn't seem to enjoy the story, I think I was looking forward to when they would interrupt Oswald's attempt to kill JFK and what the effects of saving JFK would be on the future - I didn't seem to focus as much on the story between Sadie and Jake/George.<br /><br />This second time through I took my time, comprehended more and enjoyed the love story. When I started re-reading after breaks of one or several days I was able to recollect the previous storyline, something I do not think I was able to do the first time.<br /><br />I have never re-read a book before, but I'm glad I took the time to read this one again. I may just pickup the hardcover so I'll always have a copy.
B008EEWN6I|3.0|this is a much slower album, and just does not have the feeling that the earlier releases have. listen to the previews and decide for yourself if its a must have. I just snagged it on sale, and for that price its decent. full price not so much
B001EN71CW|5.0|Everything is GREAT about this TV series! Except, of course, that it ran only one year. A story of a mixed bag of crew members on a ship for hire. A captain, ex military, played by Nathan Fillion (you may know him as &#34;Castle&#34;) and a woman as 2nd officer, fellow ex rebel fighter, played by Gina Torres, currently on &#34;Suits&#34;. Delightful, imaginative  story lines.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|My whole family loves to play.  We all have different strategies and it's a competition among us who gets through the game first.  It's easier to play on the Kindle then the iPod touch.  The small screen makes it too easy to touch the wrong part of the screen.
1402760663|5.0|I've read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee twice, once as a teen and once as an adult.  Both times I found it a very moving account of Indian history as told by the tribesmen themselves.  This particular edition is beautifully illustrated with outstanding historical photos included.  I recommend getting a simpler paperback edition for first time readers.  This book is almost heirloom quality and will be kept in my family.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the show and find all the twists and turns riveting!  The characters you love and the ones you love to hate.  The traditions of the time that are weaved into the show are very interesting.  My husband falls asleep with it every time but I love it!
B007712XAU|5.0|I loved watching the show on tv so ordered the set to give to friends as a gift. They all enjoyed it, too.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I really liked the first 3 episodes that I've watched so far.  I am a Dowton Abbey fan and this reminds me of that.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This was an amazing book.  Simply written, but so many lessons to be taken from it.  Very impacting. Loved it.
B008Y768XO|5.0|I loved this movie!  A friend of mine recommened it to me and just said it was REALLY good.  I thought it was wonderful but I didn't realize it was going to be such an emotional movie!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I really enjoyed firefly. I liked the cowboy space theme. It would have bean nice if it was still on the air.
B007704HO6|5.0|A story from the beginning to the end where I didn’t put the book down<br />Where is the next one !!!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read this book many years ago and decided to re-read it. A very long novel but worth the time.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This is an update to my original review.  I figured since it was so cheap a warning to folks about the balance issue would be helpful.  To my surprise the seller contacted me through Amazon, apologized and is replacing the tripod.  I am going to ask my husband to make a wooden base for it so that it won't tip over.  Great Seller. The third star is for the seller.<br /><br />This is a great little idea.  I bought one for my grandson for his birthday.  It was fine until he put the Iphone on and then it tipped over and the part at the top that holds the phone in place broke off.  A good idea and inexpensive but the legs need a bigger spread to provide stability.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed the first and now the second book. Hated the price but I bought it for a long read while on vacation. Cheaper than the flight and week in Aruba.
B00001U0DP|5.0|It is so heartwarming and tearjerking at the same time. A great story showing the corruption of humanity alongside the beauty of human relationships and love. Benigni is amazing!
B004LP3AYI|2.0|I finished the first book and enjoyed it very much. But when I tried to purchase the kindle edition of this book it is not available because of errors. There is no excuse for this! The author is loosing out of potential purchases and there is no posting explaining when it will be available. How difficult could it be to fix the problem.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I downloaded this game before I went on a flight last month.  I was thoroughly entertained just playing this game for the whole flight!  It takes some quick thinking to make it very far.  Basically you are running really fast and you need to avoid all the obstacles in your way.  The controls are nice, although I like to blame them for me making a wrong move...
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Looked forward anxiously to see this film.  Acting outstanding, story lacking.  Very dark scenes, hard to see.  Nothing compelling. Stopped after 30 minutes.  Very disappointed.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Great Game! For some reason, I have trouble navigating the planes during flying missions even after calibrating my kindle and changing the steering settings, I still can't get the plane up off the ground.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo moved at a fast pace; was exciting and also gripping.  Great editing and direction.  Recommended.  Interesting that a female CIA operative had the story early and right.
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|Half the song are really good and the other half are a WTF? Not bad for being inspired from a TV series.
B003T6GVWI|5.0|I liked the few &#34;hits&#34; on past albums, but I like just about every song on this album.  We frequently listen to it all the way through.  And the live concert DVD that came out afterwards is excellent as well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This minecraft doesn't have the pc objects and you can't mine Redstone so I've would've rated it 5 stars if it had those things.
B00BF123WG|4.0|In first 10 minutes or so, we had a lot of trouble understanding what was being said. The talking was so fast, lots of other sounds... we tried turning it up, turning it down...we weren't sure we were going to make it through the movie.  But then things calmed down and it was great.  Besides rocky start and beginning, we were hoping for more after the capture.  Kinda surprised it got so many Oscar nominations and hype, but it was good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a Fun game. I really enjoyed the variety and music. It is very relaxing and challenging. I recommend it highly to see anyone.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Elizabeth Haynes knows where the dark corners are, and she knows the details inside the very nooks and crannies.  This is one of my OMG, favorites!  It was OCD scary, and promised to take the reader to the nail biting edge.  What got me was the love/lust interests, the bully, the lover, the protector and the prey all meshed into a seriously intense, (this s*** happens) plot.  I get goose bumps thinking about it
B002ZG981E|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
0307887448|5.0|Starts off slow but gets very exciting quickly and doesn't stop till the end. Outcome of the novel was easy to predict but getting to that point was good. Highly recommend this book.
B000Q67876|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Very Entertaining Movie. Made me laugh and the music was good as well. Not your typical teenage bathroom movie humor.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Okay, not really impressed, but my wife was pretty impressed with Channing Tatum and his dancing ability. Me I just as soon have watched an old John Wayne movie.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Another Batman movie. Somewhat hard to follow. You have to have seen all the previous movies to follow the plot. Bale good at Batman and Batwoman pretty nice to look at in her Batwoman outfit.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a beautiful movie.  It is breathtaking and the singing is raw and full of emotion that the stage version can't match.  If you like<br />musicals or are a fan of Les Mis, I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to own this.  The entire cast is awesome.  Will watch this a hundred times, and am dreaming of the TV that will do this justice.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Me gusto porque llego a tiempo... ademas el empaque en buenas condiciones y también el precio era muy conveniente. muchas gracias.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|For anyone who loves the musical or the movie, this is a great addition.  This includes all the songs so you get all your favorites from the film.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|These are Cheap and good.  They look authentic to me. Even the packaging looks good.  It seems there are many fakes out there but these look genuine and they get the job done for less than half the cost of a retail store!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|I love Walking Dead so getting the CD was great.  Once you hear the songs you remember that part in the show, it takes you back.  Great CD!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie had a great storyline and was great for all ages - especially if you have a classic video-game lover in the house :)
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Great lite when you need one quick. Ads are no problem. Don't have to worry about where you put the candles or if your flash light has batteries.
B001ILFUD2|2.0|I bought this for my daughter as a gift, but it had been so long since I had seen it that I wouldn't recommend it for children under 5 due to association with crime.
1423124960|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday present for my grand niece. She loves anything Disney Princess. I read to her each night that she stays with me. She enjoys the stories each time. I like that they are not too long, so that more than one can be read to her.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I COULDN'T STOP READING,IT WAS ENTERTAINING.It had a great ending .I will look for other books by this author.I will look for the movie.
B002VHI8J0|4.0|This is a book that needs to be read quickly - it is made up of a number of stories that are interwoven subtly, and if you take time to read it as I did then I needed to go back to the previous story to remember the connection.<br />I finished the book reading it electronically when overseas. Was a perfect example of why - for me - a real book works better in many cases. It is not easy to flip back on a kindle book!<br />Regardless - I found the stories fascinating.
B009X00E18|4.0|It does a good job of protecting my Kindle.  I use this unit daily and it gets a lot of wear and tear.  The Microshell protects it very well.  Also it works very well as a stand when I am using the unit in landscape view.
B0016BP0PW|5.0|...Allow me to set a few parameters here:<br /><br />...First off, I usually hate musicals! I just dont like the basic premise of them, which is to push the songs on ya.<br /><br />...Disney is the Best example of this, as the stories are written around the songs they intend to market to your kids.<br /><br />...Secondly, I am an old-fart, old enough to have seen the Beatles perform live on the Ed Sullivan show in 1963...as I was in college at that time. They had a fresh new sound, look, and approuch to rock-n-roll...and had a profound influence on the genre, culture, and music in general. They were the advance-guard for a whole new wave of highly original music that changed the world as we knew it, and I was quickly captivated by their unique sound and style and lyrics. Unlike other groups like the Stones, who never changed their style much, every new Beatles album was unique, new and original!....They evolved continually, and we followed....<br /><br />...I am always interested in how others have taken Beatles music and tried to put a different spin on it...and this movie does a brilliant job of showing us a slice of life during that time-period and place thru the eyes of a young man, who experiences all the turbulence and change that occured during the early-60's to mid 70's...wrapped around many of the Beatles songs.<br /><br />...This is a musical unlike most musicals...with a strong plot, good characters, and some fantastic choreography. The songs are sung by the main characters, and the lyrics are relevant to what is happening to that individual at that time....so it is a musical montage entwined around the history of the times as it interacts with each person's life.<br /><br />...There are some rock-legends doing cameos, like Bono, and Joe Cocker, who plays several characters, and the entire production is done with a healthy respect and genuine affection for the Beatles music and influence, and is a nicely done presentation overall, so those of us old enought to remember those times get a fresh look at it with a sensory-overload of sounds and colorful imagery. Obviuosly, I highly reccommend it!<br /><br />...I already own it, and got this for my younger brother who never managed to see it..........
B0063M22QO|4.0|Easier than I thought it would be.  On to something a little more difficult.<br />I am glad I got the game
B005NFWCSK|5.0|not sure what to say , it was a good movie. like the whole ex-man series...... hello hello hello hello
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Paid for this one and I got taken.  The product does not not at all no matter what I do to try to get it to do so.  Don't waste your time or money.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|I use one of the full size slots to hold a tiny USB adapter so it is always handy. The other full size slot holds a micro SD to full size adapter for devices that need it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This film is so superb on so many different levels that it would take a thousand words to capture its greatness.  I am a history buff, and this film pulled me into that era so effectively that i felt i was in those scenes, and not just a bystander.  The performances are all great--Day-Lewis is the greatest male actor in the world today.  Very unhappy Sally Field was not rewarded for her outstanding performance--she had such a difficult character to portray and the range of emotions she had to master was daunting--but she did it beautifully.  James Spader is the big surprise here--he steals every frame he is in.<br />I have no idea what the world sees in Joseph Gordon-Levitt--he's getting one plum role after another and he's as stiff and uninteresting as cardboard.  I congratulate Stephen Spielberg for this gift to us all, and respect the artistry and brilliance of the screenplay author: Tony Kushner.  I never knew Lincoln before this film--now I am reading so many books that are tangential to this part of history that a whole new world has opened to me.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I really love this movie, been loving it for a long time and ive been wanting to get a dvd of it so i could start my collection of his movies. Before i decide to buy this, can we change the language of it to english? or does it come in japanese?
B006P4FBUE|5.0|I teach piano & this is a good tool for ear training.  My students hear it & then transfer to the piano.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Watched it the day it delivered and felt like a kid again!! This is a classic childhood movie that all kids must see.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you grew up in the 1980-90's you should read this whether or not you like scifi.  This is his first novel?  Can't wait to read the next.
B000UO8BB6|5.0|very good arrangements and a superb hancock sound.I am happy that I bought this fine piece,almost classic recording.<br />A pleasure to listen.
0062238868|5.0|Snipers are one of my favorite subjects and this book was great. I highly recommend it.  Very easy reading and well written.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|It was easy to read but more importantly, it was encouraging to read sucess stories.<br />I have tried just about every diet in the past with little or no sucess. I am in week four of this diet and have lost 5 pounds with very little effort. Love the book and the diet.
B00447G29S|5.0|We had the original Polar Express 3D version with the colored paper glasses which in no way compares to the awesomeness of the new 3D version!  The objects in the movie appear to be coming into your living room and the movie is so much more exciting in this 3D version.  This version is a vastly different version and a much better version.  I would highly recommend this 3D movie to all and it is also great to also have the blu-ray version to watch in a different format!
B00A4FOWYQ|1.0|How does one begin a negative review? I have been listening to Tegan and Sara for many years now, So Jealous still being my favorite. I have always respected the fact that T&S were kinda in the independant singer/songwriter genre. Hearthrob reminded me of a poorly written Top 40 album. I was severely dissapointed when The Con was released, mainly because of my hatred for the ever so overated Death Cab For Cutie DB, and his input in the making of that album, however, I rather enjoyed Sainthood. The single \\"Closer\\" was released, and I was pretty excited about a new Tegan and Sara album. The single was a bit poppy, and reminded me of The Con in many ways, but I still enjoyed it. For the record, the only track off this record worth a darn. I bought the album, as I do with artist I trust. I havent felt so ripped off since Transformers hit the big screen again! If I wanted sellout garbage, I would purchase a Taylor Swift CD! I know that the Quinn sisters have an enormous amount of talent, and it frustrates me that they would cheat their true fan base with absolute mediocracy! If the paid protestors \\"Shame On\\" ever get a gig again, it needs put forth to Tegan and Sara. Shame on you two! Absolute Garbage!
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I'd like to counter the misinformation in some of the other reviews:<br />1) Within the app,  the Credits show that it was jointly created with the dev of Bridge Constructor. 2) Bridge construction does not require wifi; it works offline. 3) The game begins with projects which provide good tutorial  instructions on how to use the app.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love the CD all songs are great. Listen to the CD at work and now everyone wants to borrow it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished the Wool omnibus and thought it was so fantastic that I immediately bought the sequel. Can't get enough of it. It is a kind of science fiction book that plays in the future, but the story is all about people and what they go through. Each chapter is describing the situation and the thoughts of one of the main characters, so we see the story from different perspectives.<br />Usually I read my books only on the train, but for this book I have been reading at home in the evenings, just because the story is so intriguing. The writer writes well and I consider also buying other books from him. For those who have read the Wool omnibus, I can tell that the sequal is just as good a book and there we learn more about the beginning of the project.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Great CD enjoy the music as a young man and I still enjoy the songs today.Will recommend the CD for any one who loves rock.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Bought this as an replacement for a still missing version that I cant find. This is one of my all time favorite movies so its hard to give it a bad rating. Movie quality was fine and fast and simple transaction. A+++
B003G4W49C|4.0|This was an easy read and it went quick. I have had a taste for SciFi books lately and this was a just what I needed to entertain me for several hours.<br /><br />Look forward to reading more books along these kind of plot line.<br /><br />Thanks for the great read!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|A must see film that is certainly in the conversation as a top 10 all times. Well worth the 3 hours.
B000002A46|5.0|This album is a MUST for me and my family's Christmas playlists! All of her songs are beautiful, festive, and fun.  There are some fun arrangments that she has done, while &#34;Oh Holy Night&#34; is more appropriately spiritual and slow.  Mariah Carey has created a very awesome Christmas album with &#34;Merry Christmas&#34; and will help you and your family get into the Christmas spirit, even if you are that type of person who is skeptical or uneasy about the pop Christmas songs out there today! Must have for Christmas time!
B0009HLD0K|4.0|Nice to be able to get an old movie like this as you can't get it on Netflix or Red Box.  It's just like I remember it from 20+ years ago.
0451529065|5.0|Throughout the years, The Orgin of Species has brought many different readers into the world of science and made it easier and more exciting for them.  While there are parts of this book that are very scientific, I have been impressed with the way that Charles Darwin is able to state his findings and arguments when it comes to the natural world.  He is a very talented writer and is able to help the regular joe understand a little bit more about evolution and science.<br /><br />I also LOVED his introduction to the book, a very great and personal touch to his most famous work.  This copy is also great because it is compact and can fit into my purse (which can be a difficult task to accomplish)! For the price, I would recommend this copy of a beautiful scientific classic for anyone who has been curious or interested in reading it!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|won't load on  my kindle. got to play one time and it wont load again. i was really excited to play. disappointed..
B007Z2IAAI|5.0|It's playable, but when I took it out of the box, the record was sticking out no matter what side I put it on. 5 stars because it's age. Out was also a coincidence that the initials the person wrote on it before I bought it are my initials.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|NEVER thought i could like a zombie type movie and I have NEVR been a real fan of any type of horror stories. They all seemed too corny or cheesy. But after pulling up the first season episode by complete accident (THANK GOD!)  I am now such a BIG fan. I can't get enough of this show! I hate re-runs, but i find myself pulling up episodes of WD  I have already watched just in case I have missed something!  The down side of my new addiction: My house is a wreck, my husband is SICK of sandwiches & fast food. The up-side I can save my family in a Post- Apocalypse world l if need be.
B00280LYIC|4.0|It was an ok book. Had a lot of details. I would definitely recommend to anyone.  I'm going to read the sequel
B00006G8HX|4.0|My Wife and kids enjoyed it just as I did when I was a kid! Watching it brought back a since of Nostalgia! :)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Not very good lags a lot but when u glitch it up it is awesome<br /><br />Ps.only get this game if you want your device to crash
0545259088|4.0|I found that of the books in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, this was my least favorite.  However, it is still a great book.  The author has the same elegant, captivating writing style, I just was not completely satisfied with this book as a resolution to the series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable reading, as written from Pat's point of view, featuring his journal entries which chronicle his release from a mental institution following a mysterious &#34;break&#34; of memory.  Although Pat remembers everything about his time in the institution, he does not rememember anything prior to his institutionalization.  Not working and living with his parents, he calls this episode of his life &#34;apart&#34; time, which refers to the time he is away from his estranged wife.  His main goal in life is to get back to his wife.  He meets Tiffany, a &#34;different&#34; kind of girl, who ultimately agrees to help him to end his &#34;apart&#34; time.  An interesting and wonderful treatment of mental illness, family dynamics, and love. I enjoyed this novel thoroughly.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie.  This is definitely a must have to add to your collection.  Quick turn around time from shippper.  Definitely recommend.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games enough for me to continue reading the series.  It is an interesting look into a post-apocalyptic world.  Katniss Everdeen is a confident and capable heroine who inspires us to do great things, way beyond merely &#34;playing the game.&#34;  This is an interesting second part to the trilogy.
B004SIP7F8|5.0|One of my top ten picks. Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful story. Great actors. I wish more movies were made like this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Katniss Everdeen continues to inspire in this third and final part to the trilogy.  There were some surprises for me in the way the trilogy evolved, both with the plot and the characters, and although not all of these surprises were satisfying for me.  I felt some of the characters should have been &#34;fleshed out&#34; sufficiently so that their motivations could be understood.  However, the writing in these novels is lush, and I can easily see where they would easily translate to the big screen.
B004H4XJW6|5.0|Megamind was a great movie! My husband and I enjoy watching it as much as our son does and it is one of the few children's movies we don't mind seeing over and over again. The Button of Doom is only like 12 minutes long and I thought that would be disappointing, but it actually has turned out to be a lifesaver during the times that I want my son occupied for a few minutes but don't want him to throw a fit that I am turning the tv off before his &#34;show&#34; is done. And, it is actually a great short!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is the ultimate romance novel.  It is so well-written, with characters so well-described, that it is impossible to think that I could possibly write anything but to say that this classic of English literature is personally my most favorite novel since the very first time I read it many years ago.  Although there are no sexy scenes in this book by today's standards, there is a great deal of sexual tension, many humorous scenes, as well as an accurate description of English country life during the early 1800s.  Overall, Pride and Prejudice is pure perfection.  I recommend it to anyone wanting to experience the original romantic fiction novel.
B005EVVESM|5.0|This is an awesome CD!  I find myself listening to it almost daily.  Love me some Maroon 5!  Worth buying.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game itself is good, but in order to get to higher levels you have to be connected to the internet. Kinda irritating when you want to play and don't have access.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I'm a huge JT fan.  This CD is good, but not amazing.  To be fair, I've only listened to it a few times since purchasing it.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|this is a very challenging and addictive title, with hours of gameplay, dozens of power ups. I would definitely recommend this title.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THIS GAME. SHE HAS A HORSE OF HER OWN. IT HELPS TEACH HER ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HERS.
B004ZJZPX4|2.0|My problem with this movie, I just let too many people build it up, so my expectations were really high.
0307716554|5.0|Could hardly put this book down once started. The reality of souls being able to leave their bodies even before death, and the reality of telepathic communication, was a joy to read--even in a heartbreaking context. Can't wait to read her other book and hope she writes many!  Thank you Rosamund Lupton for a book filled with complex, real characters. I felt like I was right there with them.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Highly addictive game once you start playing it as well that I like it because it had the two thing I like it's free and its good.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book is an amazing read, but you need to have an open mind and understand that this is a very honest look at the year in the life of a addict.  I gained much respect for Nikki Sixx for coming out with this very personal part of his life. It really shows how unglamorous being a rock star can be sometimes. Hopefully people will learn from his experience.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Love the idea of vampires having feelings for other species and how all their differences make them all unite in search for love and happiness.
B00BJO5SXK|1.0|I've been a fan of Tyler and Odd Future for a while, but this album sounded like it was thrown together in a day or two. Everyone on this album had lyrics that weren't clever. The original cleverness of Odd Future is what made me a fan. Now, I'm not. 1-star.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Loved it! It was a great book it was awesome I totally think this book was awesome!!! Awesome awesome book
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Many people think World War I started over the assination of Archduke Ferdinand and his wife Sophia.  This in-depth study of the events leading to that tragedy reveals the political entanglements that made World War I inevitable and went on to percipitate World War II and the shaping of modern Europe.  It also reveals why we must learn from history in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Interesting subject. A bit terrifying. A little slow at in the middle, but a worthy read. Lionel has a killer vocabulary.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|looks like an &#34;in between&#34; book. you notice the absence of Edd Stark. However is well constructed and continues going in depth with remaining characters
B00BDZV9M4|5.0|Alot of musical suprises in this album.  Starts off with a very powerful classical piano piece.  It's different from his other albums, musically he goes everywhere.  Lyrically some of his songs are very dark, but then some are not. The cover art work is a reference to the movie \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\", that should give you a clue to how the album is going to go.  Like I said, this is a very different rap album.  One musical suprise after another.  Very creative me thinks.
0709058764|3.0|Fine finishing book,  but not too deep content. I Would Like to see more templates, plans and greater approach on the types of wood for making of violins. Optimum for the first contact to the art.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Highly developed characters that appeal to all ages...great story, gorgeous animation!!  Highly recommend it!!  Everyone knows a 'Jack Frost'.. should be seen by all!
B004T4LUPW|3.0|This is easy to use and easy to read.  You can break it up by day, week, or month.  I just wish it had an alarm on it for when it is appointment time.  If it had that, it would have a 5 star and lots of hearts by it.  But now I have to check it the day before, then set my alarm clock app for when I need to go to appointment.  :-(  But I could find nothing that had all that and an alarm.  What can a girl do?
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Not a bad CD overal but  I did not like several of the tracks I was a bit dissapointed as I really like JT
B008602KQI|5.0|Not as good as books but still good. Some important parts of book left out like the mayor daughter giving mokingjjay pin

B003P2WO5E|5.0|With over 1,000 pages and a $3 price tag, this was easily the best book investment I've made this year. Only took one long weekend to read but that was because I didn't bother to sleep much. I love a book that can suck me in like that.<br /><br />Characters are like-able. Yes, the characters lacked a lot of grey-area that some prefer. However, they were not one-dimensional. They were characters in a complex harsh world struggling with their own sense of honor and values. Lovely.<br /><br />Magic was fun and complex.<br /><br />Humor felt real and appropriate.<br /><br />Action was well paced.<br /><br />History/back stories were revealed slowly; in patchy bits. Sometimes this was effective, sometimes confusing or too long coming. There are still a lot of questions about the past that need to be revealed.<br /><br />All around, a satisfying narrative arch.<br /><br />Ending left me frustrated... craving more!
B00136NVH4|5.0|I love this CD! I'm glad I finally purchased it, because my tape wore out! Now, I downloaded it to my MP3, so I can listen to it all the time when I'm working out or on a long plane ride!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The production and cast are great.  Will get season 3 for sure.  I can wait for it.  The packaging and blu-ray features are great
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Ordered this for my sister and her son; both love the movie and<br />have rented and watched it many times.  Now they can watch<br />it many more times whenever they want.  The dvd arrived very<br />promptly and in great condition.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|it never worked  I tried it several times but but it still never printed anything.  So i have a sour feeling about printbot
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wow. Just, wow. I could not put this book down and yet I still had the pleasure of reading it over a few days. Hell I backed out of plans more than once to read this candy sweet treat of a read! Best writing ive seen yet, alll the things Abby and Travis went through, how real all the characters felt, nothing short of spectacular. This is my first book of Jamie Mcquires that i have read but I can say with pride the same minute I finished I bought all her others and she has just earned a life long fan. THANK YOU JAMIE for the time, effort, creativity, etc you put into creating this work of art.<br /><3 kg

B000AY74OG|5.0|good price. again bought for my 10 year old daughter who had the sequel but not the first one. this made her very happy
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Be prepared.. its slow.. but good, practically no action and all drama. So dont start this movie if you are already tired.<br />nice to see other parts of the Lincoln history that don't involve only his death/after death situations.
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Leave it to Bryan Ferry to put some of his classic songs to the early Jazz sound. These great arrangements will introduce a lot of people to Classic Jazz . More Artists should expand their musical boundaries like Bryan Ferry.
B008JFUTT0|4.0|Let's be honest.  There are thousands and thousands of great song writers and musicians who never quite make it to the big time.  So what is so different about admittedly talented Sixto Rodriguez, a cross between Bob Dylan and Jose Feliciano?  For one thing, although he hardly sold a record in the U. S.(he made 2 albums in 1970 & 1971),  he was bigger than Elvis or The Beatles in apartheid South Africa.<br /><br />Since there was so little known about Rodriguez - rumor was he was dead - a couple fans decided to try to find him or at least something about him.  Stephen `Sugar' Segerman, Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore begin the detective work and filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul documents it all in this brisk 86 minute film.  As unlikely as it was, Rodriguez was never aware of his overseas popularity and evidently neither was anyone else.  South Africa was ostracized by most of the world for their racial segregation, so not a lot of information came in or went out.  The state controlled the media and media access.<br /><br />As Rodriguez songs became popular and controversial for their content, the government even censored certain tracks by scaring the vinyl.  As it turns out Rodriguez is found in a rundown house in a rundown neighborhood in rundown Detroit.  His ultimate coming out party in South Africa in 1998 is as unlikely as you could imagine.  The audiences went crazy.  He was as popular as anybody.  Although Rodriguez is touring again now, he still lives in the old house in Detroit and gives away his money to family and friends.  Although I was fascinated by this remarkable story, I kept wondering what ever happened to all the royalty checks the South African record companies sent to Rodriguez label back in the States.  Somebody should be sued, but I suspect Rodriguez just doesn't care.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|The movie  I was taken from the begi highly recommended by me a must to see for young and highly recommended by me a must to see for young and old.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|Not a big fan of JT, but Timberland more than made up for that lukewarm feeling of the artist.  Timbo is up to his usual tricks with heavy beats and creative layers to his tracks.  Songs might be a bit long for some, but Timbo fans will appreciate the  embellishment.
B004WR125O|4.0|The wireless LAN adapter works exactly as it should, but it was a little complicated to set up.  I am still having a problem finding the stations that I usually listen to.  Once that is sorted, I will be completely satisfied.
1452113432|5.0|Made me want to run away to Paris. Delightful, humble meals that are traditional and delicious. Rachel Khoo has a passion for good produce and entertaining, looking forward to trying these out on my friends!
B005NGKLX2|5.0|This movie is creative and done very well. Instead of the dribble that fills the screen, here you are given a part of history of the American west and a film production that is equal to if not better than any I have seen in years.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Full facebook is too much to see on my kindle fire 7&#34; and the mobile version is not enough; so here we are right in the middle

B00632HWOG|4.0|Like having the yahoo mail app on my android tablet! Glad i was able to get it from amazom too. As far as yahoo mail itself, i hate it. Cannot stand yahoo anymore since they made so many changes.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|It's easy to install. Also It rotates 180 degrees so yes, you can charge your kindle while the case is closed.<br />I keep it with the power ports facing to the right (outside) that way the kindle always opens like a book, is upright and apps won't be upside down. If you do use the camera to chat or take pictures, then just simply rotate it (power ports will be inside) and you can stand it up on the case. (as shown in the video) I feel that my kindle is safely in place and case is easy to keep clean. The only thing is that it does feel just a little heavy, but I can deal with it. And i love the sleep/wake lid! I hope they come up w new designs or colors, if so I will definitely get another!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Cowboys joining together with \\"Indians\\" and Outlaws  to combat Aliens who are mining gold...what kind of a world is that. Not bad as it turns out. Most of us would agree that although \\"Indians\\", as they  were back then, had a chance to make good money being killed in the movies, still, we have to move on to the ideas of this century not of the 19th. Aliens, give it a thought, who else can we vilify and kill before they kill us, except aliens. With political and economic interactions changing allies, enemies and neutrals (generally leaning one way or the other) so rapidly, in the time between starting the planning of a movie and its release, the enemy might well be a friend not to be maligned by the media.<br />Putting history aside, how does it work.  Pretty well. There were some constraints on the film-makers. Given Harrison Ford's long history as a Good Guy, they had to see that he didn't come off as an Evil Guy would. He is still too much of a star for that. It is also harder (I think for most of us) to see monstrous aliens in the Native West than in the Cities and urbanized areas. Just a matter of being used to that natural target of aliens over the many decades now. All in all, for me, the adjustment wasn't too difficult, although I did find it impossible to make it a complete one. If you like Westerns, and have some imagination, I should think you could enjoy this as a light, not to be taken too seriously, cowboys and 'indians' film, with some adjustment necessary.  It is probably too much to ask that anyone who grew up when the West was really the West, will really accept the transformation fully. For others, its unpredictable. Alien film devotees will not be much impressed by these specimens, in the context of the action. They should have been much more effective in combat than they were shown to be.<br />All in all, it is not a poor film, it is not a very good one, either. It falls into the category of unpredictable audience response. You might like it, assomething you can watch for a couple of hours without having to think about what is happening, you might dislike it for not sticking to the format formed in centuries of America's love for the Western story. If it is financially painless to  see it, and if you do not want to be deeply involved in what you see, it might well work for you.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|The writers and the director did a GREAT job of casting and show cassing the movie to coinside with the other JK To. books that were made into films. the book and the movie were almost identical. I love it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The first hour dragged a bit. Other than that, it was a good movie. Good set pieces. Out-of-this-world costumes!! Good acting, for the most part.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I can't even believe this show was a hit. Awful I can't even believe they put this on television. I was hoping I could see a change in season 2, but nope, I didn't even make it through the whole thing.
B001F751EC|4.0|Sad and hard to watch, but an artistically great movie.<br />Based on a true story.<br />Don't let the subtitles scare you!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Best show is when Castle's Daughter is kidnapped and castle goes to find her. The writers show Castle in such a different light, that it is almost scary how dark he can get in &#34;real-life&#34; instead of just in his novels. I don't like &#34;Iron Gates&#34; I believe that should be a male character and can't wait to see her either leave or get on board with the team.<br /><br />One thing I don't understand, why can Javi and Leighy have a relationship out in the open? Yet not Castle and Beckett... Is it because they are working directly with each other...Or is it because there needs to a rule that they are breaking to keep it dramatic...or is there really no way to portrate love over a murder case....
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Amazing movie. I really enjoyed it. Be sure to watch how it was made, very interesting. Very well made movie.
B009GX6SSK|3.0|The plots are highly predictable and the acting is ok. Screen writing is ok. They are such a specialized team, that is just seems they should be working more highly classified cases, rather than a murder case.
1407499238|5.0|What an incredible audiobook and narration. I don't know how this author managed to tackle this very sensitive and debated subject. I appreciated the perspectives of each character and listening to how they weighed in on the subject. I am very glad I listened rather than read for this reason. I loved laughing, being sad and, mad, and the sarcasm throughout the book. I saw the end coming and knew it would happen but I didn't want it to. I didn't get my happy ending but it was a sad but beautiful ending.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|If you liked the first one you will love this one! It links to the first and has the same actors in it so its not just a crappy sequel with new actors!! Its good
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Very cute movie for especially anyone who played games in the 80's. If you watch it more than once it gives you the chance to really see all the details. We bought the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool. I like the different settings. I play all the time! Sydney Australia is my favorite.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|great family movie.... worth watching! We even bought the movie and have watched it many times. (movie movie movie) Enjoy
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is amazing! Although sometimes it can be a little slow its still worth the download it makes Facebook easier and better! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome. I used to wonder why everyone liked it so much. The only thing that needs to be improved is they need this game for the Nook
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app is fantastic. Being able to text without having to pay is a huge boon for the user. My only complaint is that it will not keep a user name and password between sessions if you turn your device off. If that wasn't the case it would be 5 stars!
0451208706|5.0|When I first started reading this book I wasn't sure I would like it but the more I read the more eager I became to turn the pages.  I have only read one book of Ken Follet and that was Pillars of the Earth, which I thought was excellent.  Ken Follet knows how to tell a good story and doesn't use too many characters to confuse the reader.  I often find the middle section of a lot of books become a little boring but not this one, it flowed with anticipation and had me enthralled right to the very last breathtaking finale.  I loved this book and will definately be reading more of his work.
B005LAJ212|5.0|I have a friend who recommended it. We like the same type of shows so wanted to catch up. Can hardly wait for Season 2. Am taping Season 3
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|A heartbreaking true story that gives a clearer picture of who we are dealing with in North Korea.  It will also open your eyes to the world around you and teach you to appreciate what we have in America.
B000000XB9|5.0|Before  hearing it featured  on a television show (Hardcastle & McCormack) I had never heard the song that inspired me to make the purchase and anxiously awaited it.  I was not disappointed and have enjoyed it on a regular bases.
B0031RS64G|2.0|As the author says this book is not for everyone and unfortunately it's not for me.  I just could not get into it even after reading half of it.
B009FZFONO|3.0|The story is far-fetched and leaves a lot up to the imagination.  The acting is average.  However, it's addivtive.  I watched the first two seasons via Netflix within about a two week span.  I was only able to watch the first six or so episodes of season three via Amazon.  I'll have to admit it was entertaining.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Have been reading Lee Childs for years, and particularly like all that are Jack Reacher.  Keep up the good work, Lee!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|WELL DOCUMETED. I WISH ITWERE LONGR .WATCH IT. DON'T HAVE ANYMORE TO SAY THANKS EVER SO MUCH AMAZON. SINCERELY, A HAPPY CUSTUMER
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Definitely better sound than the built in mono microphone on any DSLR camera.  It's definately no studio mic, but as a upgrade to the built-in one this does the job.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderfully written saga of an aristocratic family. It keeps you interested and excited for the next episode. Maggie Smith's wit and humor is unmatched!
B005721Y7Y|4.0|This is a great movie about communication break-down.  Devastation can result when families that no longer communicate. I don't like that a child was choosen for Mr. Lesters lust!
B00899EOIS|5.0|Season 3 is great! My only complaint? It's missing my favorite episode!<br />I had remembered the specific episode missing from when it had first aired on TV; SPOILER ALERT**the one where Hanna invites Toby to a church party as a distraction for trying to meet \\"A\\", and Spencer and Alison's brother are able to find Alison's missing anklet! Sure enough, I looked it up and the episode is actually titled \\"Can You Spike The Punch At Church\\". It's supposed to be episode 6, but \\"The Remains of A\\" or something like that is in its place for some reason.<br />I don't know if this episode was purposely left out of availability on Amazon, or if it was just forgotten!! I would like to have it here though, because it was a good episode! A season can't really be \\"complete\\", if it's missing an episode!  Please put it on here Amazon, so I can watch!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU!
B00C1E8E7E|4.0|Tyler is an OK artist, and I can appreciate the fact that he tells stories with his albums...but his flow gets a bit annoying after a while. I kind of like EARL better.

0425264386|5.0|Die Trying by Lee Child<br /><br />I am now getting used to the pace Lee Child sets in his Jack Reacher books.  I am budgeting the time necessary to read it in as short a time as possible since it is darn near impossible to put down.  In this rendition, Jack is in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up in a hostage situation with a psychotic militia.<br /><br />Jack is once again a force of nature.  He is willing to go with the flow unless he is personally affronted or if he feels someone is being wronged.  We find out in this book that Jack is sniper trained.  I have only read four other Reacher books and I was not aware of this area of his expertise.<br /><br />Holly, a wounded bird FBI agent, is the object of Jack's affection in this book.  It appears that Jack is destined for heart break in his previous books but perhaps he gets lucky in this book.  (Take that for whatever meaning you want to ascribe to it.)<br /><br />Government agencies, the military and bureaucracy in general are once again showcased with a high level of incompetency.  Beau Borken is an excellent villain as he is so easy to despise.  Child paints with a broad brush and not a lot of technical nuances.  His stories are easy to follow and frequently leave you breathless with their pace.  Although this book is several years old, the plot resonates with the current events of the Boston Marathon.  That adds a veneer of believability that enhances the story and frankly is rather frightening.  In spite of that I am really enjoying this series.<br /><br />I do like the way Jack faces his fear and conquers it.<br /><br />There is non-stop action and lots of violence.  I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.<br /><br />Web Site: [...]
B001S86J0I|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious. So glad I own it now! The DVD came in perfect quality as well. Thanks!
B006LSZECO|4.0|For me this book started out a bit slow, but after a while all the twists and turns kept me turning the pages.
B00902UH5M|5.0|No matter what you think of Arnold Schwarzenegger, you must admit that he is an incredible, polarizing figure. This book captures his rise (and a little bit of his fall) through his eyes. It reads like a movie.<br /><br />If you're interested in improving yourself and learning how to achieve your dreams, like Arnold did, I can't recommend it enough.
1576754227|3.0|I was coersed into buying this book. I would like to shove it down the person's throat. I would not buy it again, especially not from Amazon since they take forever to deliver.
B00BHU261S|3.0|An ok film about the life and work of Alfred Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren is her usual awesome self, but Anthony Hopkins didn't seem to have his heart in it.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Fun app. really enjoy it. great for music lovers like us. its like having a mini karaoke machine in your phone.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Great CD/LP for the Bon Jovi fans!!! I really liked it a lot!!! Buy it !!! Try it !!! Yeah!!!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Heard about it for years...read it and loved it.  A great pirate tale...I just hope the next movie is as spectacular.  The movies up to this point have all been pretty &#34;b&#34; grade, excluding the Muppet version :-).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Amazing a must have for any college student, awesome that I can go from kindle to computer with no problems and print notes that I took on my kindle.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I liked all the characters. It took my breath away when they discovered they couldn't be together. A must read!
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I bought this because of the reviews but have to admit I was really concerned because of the size. It looked awkwardly large. But I have to admit it works better than anything I've tried to date and is really easy to hold and use. I wanted it primarily for cartooning so lines needed to start and end exactly were I wanted them. I was pleasantly surprised by the accuracy. I didn't give it a 5th star only because I know there are other stylus that are even better, but they cost 3 or 4 times as much so for the price this is a great choice. If i could give it 4.5 stars that would be a more accurate rating.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works fine and is long enough to where it doesn't have to lay on the floor once plugged in.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|It has it's flaws, as do all of the office apps. But this one has good file support, web support, and Google printing. I just wish updates came through Amazon faster.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|DA has me hooked, you never know what twist or turn will happen each week.  I only wish they would play the English version here in American.  Thank goodness Amazon.com has them for pennies an episode.
B00BO2VKBG|5.0|Like their earlier release, this album is super sludgy and hazy. Straight stoner metal. Unbelievable!!!! Love it!! Very enjoyable listen. Valley of The Dolls is an amazing track as well as Poison Apple. GET IT ASAP!
0802473156|5.0|A must read if you are in relationship. It gives you plenty to think about and answers many of your questions regarding the opposite sex. I recommend this book to everyone!
B000YJ54DU|3.0|I believe I have read all of the Reacher novels and this one is probably the runt of the litter.  All of the Reacher novels have some outlandish stuff in them, and we who read them accept that.  This one has the implausible stuff along with what I cant help but view as a half-hearted effort by the author.  His villan is ill-formed, the religious zealot backstory is under-cooked, the initial mystery of the nightly plane flights is acutely anti-climactic.  If your new to Lee Child, dont start here!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|easy to set up and got lots of extra free storage by adding computers and devices. been recommending dropbox to clients and friends
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I found this book very funny, and despite the setting, almost believable. The main and almost only character is drawn with great empathy and always a slightly twisted humor. Highly entertaining and recommended to anyone who enjoys sci-fi with a Robinson Crusoe slant.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I received this movie on the very day that they told me I would and the movie is terrific.  Already loaned it out to a friend.
030758836X|1.0|the ending of this book is completely nonsensical.  the author was either confused or lazy.  hello??!!, how about the police ask if amy has recently been at the fertility clinic where the semen is being stored ?  why didn't nick show the frozen vomit to the police?  how do the police not put amy on trial for murder when they know that she lied about so many things in the past, and that everywhere she goes she claims people are stalking/assaulting her?  there is so much damning evidence against amy that the police totally dropping the case is not believeable.  a farfetched ending wouldn't cause me to write a review, but such lazy, silly writing warrants a warning to possible buyers of this horrible book.  how is this a best seller?  reality television has more intelligent plot development than gone girl.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Received this movie on the very day they told me that I would and I love the movie.  Everyone should watch it.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for a friend's child but love this doll myself, so does my friend! I am not a doll collector, she is just beautiful!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought it was an excellent book.  Can't wait to start the final book. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first book.
