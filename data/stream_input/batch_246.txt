0736646299|4.0|This book depressed me for weeks.  The probable slaughter of all the large docile mammals by Clovis Man in the Americas about 11,000 years ago, then the slaughter of maybe 95% of the decedents of Clovis Man by European germs in the 16th Century, and all of it just so much bad luck!  Millions and millions dead, denied, and unknown.  The rape of the earth seems to be what the human animal has been about in the aggregate from the start.  Look around, the rape is unabated.  Good-bye, Sea of Cortez.  Good-bye, East Coast fisheries.  Good-by, wolf and grizzly.  Been nice to know you, but really we just couldn't help ourselves.  History, prehistory, read it and weep.  Makes me long for the good old days, say 1924 in the highlands of New Guinea, mamma's suckling a piglet, later on we will kill it, and eat it!  <br />Why do I recommend this book?  Because the ideas Mr. Diamond so painstakingly presents go from a fundamental and mostly unconscious question, \\"Why does European culture dominate the world,\\" to a breathtaking overview of the history of humans on the planet.  This book has changed the way I think about history.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Eerie and heartbreaking, Wilco's latest effort somehow manages to blow 1999's &quot;Summer Teeth,&quot; perhaps the best release of the late 90's, out of the water.  How?  Here's three reasons.<br />1. The band has been tweaked just enough to find the right mix.  Though a fine drummer, Ken Coomer was more akin to a busy drummer like Keith Moon.  But just as Moon wouldn't have worked on Velvet Underground records, Coomer's sound just wasn't right.  Enter Glenn Kotche, a Moe Tucker with crash cymbals, whose sound adds a decidedly different flavor to this entire recording that Coomer's did on the previous Wilco records.  In addition, Leroy Bach, whose piano work on classics such as &quot;My Darling&quot; and the Woody Guthrie-penned &quot;Remember the Mountain Bed&quot; has been hauntingly gorgeous, is now made a full member of the band, which shows in lovely flourishes on keyboard in &quot;War On War&quot; and spine-tingling piano for the achingly tearful closer &quot;Reservations.&quot;<br />2. Jeff Tweedy has learned how to sing.  If you're at all a Wilco fan or are educated in their history, you know of an old alt-country band called Uncle Tupelo, which featured Tweedy as lead vocalist.  If you've never heard Uncle Tupelo, listen to Wilco's first record, 'A.M.;' it's essentially the same sound.  But even as recently as 'Being There,' Tweedy seemed like he was still searching for a voice, still reaching just slightly out of his range and some sort of security as a singer.  No longer.  If in 'Summer Teeth' he found his range, Tweedy has now found confidence as a singer.  The vocals on &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; prove that a mid-range singer can be just as powerful as an alto (a la Brian &amp; Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys)<br />3. There are as many radio-friendly songs here as devotee album tracks.  A few years ago, radio stations maligned Moby's 'Play,' saying it had zero commercial potential.  Yet when the songs hit the airwaves after eighteen months of pushing them into TV ads to make some money off them, radio listeners enthusiastically gobbled the record up.  So were the programmers right?  Obviously not.  However, the record company executives at Reprise, Wilco's former label, did essentially the same thing to 'YHF,' saying it sounded like, &quot;a career-ending album.&quot;  What they were probably frightened by was the strange free-form intro to &quot;I Am Trying To Break Your Heart,&quot; even though it's not too much stranger than the intro to 1996's &quot;Miunderstood.&quot;<BR>Even through these slower-moving, beautiful tracks, there are several songs just begging to be hits: &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer,&quot; &quot;I'm The Man Who Loves You,&quot; &quot;Kamera,&quot; &quot;War On War,&quot; and &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; all have radio-airplay potential, as an uneducated listener might mistake the acoustic-laden intro to &quot;Pot Kettle Black&quot; for a (much inferior) Dave Matthews tune...or the synth-drum beats opening &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer&quot; for one of those post-nineties pop tracks...or the ferocious electric guitar beginning &quot;I'm The Man Who Loves You&quot; for...well, you get the point.<br />All-in-all, there is no reason why any listener should not own this record.  It may go down in history as one of the greatest of the new millennium.  Certainly it will go down as the best record of 2002...or 2001 (when it was released via the band's website)...or whenever.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie some how follows the plot of the PS game Resident Evil. It talks about how a syndicate turns into zombie and Milla Jovovich has to find out what has happen. It has many scary scenes and most of them got me. Milla is stylish in this movie that has [awesome] fight moves. The special effects are cool as well. Overall, it is an entertaining movie.
0385493622|5.0|Fermat's Enigma is a wonderful mathematical journey through time.  Very well written, the story is hinged upon the oldest and most difficult math proof ever put forth  --a math problem very easy to understand but so difficult to prove that even a trust full of deutsch marks was established almost one hundred years ago for whomever could provide the solution.  This 300-year-old problem has baffled the greatest mathematical minds since Pierre de Fermat jotted it down in the margins of his copy of \\"Arithmetica.\\"  The motivation among the mathematically inclined to solve this proof was a cryptic Fermat notation in the same book that he had indeed proved his claim.  However, complete notes of his proof were never found, so it has remained only a conjecture.  Fortunately Fermat did leave us with the enticing evidence that n¹4.  Fermat was a lunatic genius mathematician.  He shunned formal application of mathematics and instead chose to embrace it as an art form, baffling and taunting the greatest minds of his day with seemingly impossible mathematical conundrums that had little or no practical application.<br />The story of this problem, however, cannot be told without exploring the rich history of mathematics, and specifically number theory, from Pythagoras, Euclid, and Diophantus to Descartes, Euler, Germain, Taniyama, Shimura, and Wiles.  Wiles!  Who's that?  He is the man who after eight tenacious years finally proved Fermat's conjecture.  Wiles carefully constructed a brilliant proof on a substrate designed by historical giants in mathematics.  He combined theories in elliptic equations with modular forms with levels of math so scary that only a few people could ever understand it, let alone compute it.  Fortunately the story is told with the layperson in mind.<br />This is an extraordinary journey through history.  It is a gripping adventure that acknowledges the cumulative knowledge of a bevy of multicultural mathematical geniuses, the many claims to the solution, and one man's intense desire to solve the hardest math problem ever.  To prove Fermat's conjecture, Wiles had to first prove the fifty-year-old Taniyama-Shimura conjecture -an incredible feat in itself.  The result is a monumental advancement in mathematics.<br />While Wiles' proof by use of advanced modern mathematics is a stunning achievement, the question still remains:  If, and that if is a big one, Fermat proved n cannot be > 2, then how did he do it?  I've got pencil to paper right now...just kidding.and one man's intense desire to solve the hardest math problem ever.

B00006690G|5.0|Well when i heard \\"Without Me\\" for the first time i said oh no, Em's changed his ways in the music game becaues it sounds like a disco kinda thing but then i heard some of his other songs and they had the same eminem style but it has been enhanced over the years from his social life. There isn't as much hate on this album as there was in Martial LP. (Ex. \\"Kim\\") So far i think this album was the best because he brings more ideas and thoughts into this cd now that the hate isn't in his songs as much. Songs like \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Halie's Song\\", \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\", \\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\", \\"Sing for the MOment\\" and \\"Without Me\\", make you want to listen to this cd over and over again. Sing for the MOment is good rhymen and its chorus was taken from Aerosmith's greatest song \\"Dream On\\". \\"Say What you Say\\" could have been made a lot better and in the touching \\"Halie's Song\\" you see another side of Em and i dont care what people say. It's a good song.<br />  So Buy, burn or borrow this cd. It doesn't matter as long as you aquire this cd somehow because this is Eminem at his best. Every track is worth listening to. Dre did a great job with Eminem and both em and dre's work really shows on this album. This is a must have for any hip hop/rap lover.
B00005N915|4.0|Most of Parker's films are visually interesting. This one is viscerally mesmerizing, as well, partly because he captures the essential undulent, oily sleaziness of the Big Easy so adroitly. I lived in New Orleans for five years and can spot a fraudulent, comercially bent take when I see one (Clint Eastwood comes to mind). Mickey Rourke was one of those hit or miss actors of the 90s (I was one of those who actually liked him in \\"Barfly\\"). In this instance he is more than adequate, and he rolls along with the punchy, quirky script like the prize fighter he longed to be. Lisa Bonet, as the Nubian Lolita, is perfectly cast. No need to provide spoilers here, but the ending is one of the all time greatest, where any ambiguity that the filmmaker might have set up for us is exquisitely resolved. Certainly not one of the deepest cinema excursions ever attempted, but one of the most enjoyable, particularly for those who like a little spice and suspense in their gumbo.
B000069KE0|5.0|This album is refreshing.  It is nice to hear the creativity of Chicago in its purest form.  Remasterted (finally!), this album contains several elements which make it unique.  It has classic Chicago horns, a few political statements, and of course some all time great songs: 25 or 6 To 4, Make Me Smile &amp; Colour My World.  Top all of this off with a classical approach and what you have is a fantastic listening experience.  And to think, that is just the music.  The repackaging is equisite and definately makes the album worth the investiment.  I am looking forward to collecting the rest of their catalog.  Thumbs up to the band and the people at Rhino!
B0000640VO|5.0|Well, um, what can I say that hasn't been said by everyone else who's seen this movie? I mean, there may have been a select few who saw it and didn't like it, but they don't matter, do they? This is a magical little movie of instances, superb moments wherein a quirky young Frenchwoman is beset by grumps and cold shoulders. She sets out to make her world a better place by doing good for other people, succeeding greatly with each effort yet not really trying to improve upon her own life. There's another equally odd person that she's known since childhood and loved all the while. She freezes up whenver she nears him and runs off in a panic. This was an all around great movie. If you can get around reading subtitles then you'll enjoy this movie. I especially enjoyed Audrey Toutou (excuse any misspelling) in her alluring Zorro costume. Oh those eyes...
B00005MNP7|5.0|After blasting into most peoples homes with \\"Denis\\" in 1977, people realised that this band were full of energy and wrote very catchy pop almost in the punk vein.  Debbie Harrys' looks, pure voice, and the obvious guitar, drum and keyboards mastery of Stein, Burke, Destri .... ok, and Lafayette on bass, showed that they were no amateurs, they had real talent, and were a lot more classy than the punk scene of the time.  Thus Blondie carved their own niche of hugely catchy pop which you wanted to play over and over again, and Debbie [pulled] all the guys in so that every one fell in love with her.  Under the pop was an angst eloquently expressed by 40 year olds who have experienced the highs and lows of life.<br />\\"Plastic Letters\\" had sent them on their way with a slightly slicker sound than their previous minor breakthrough \\"Blondie\\". <BR>\\"Parallel Lines\\" showed just how much they evolved in a short time keeping one foot in the punk door while the other kicked down the door of disco and dance with \\"Heart of Glass\\".  \\"Picture This\\" still sounds like Debbie doing her Broadway bit a la Shirley Bassey, but making it rock!<br />While \\"Parallel Lines\\" maybe their greatest achievement with pop/punk, for me they moved onwards and upwards with \\"Eat to the Beat\\" in 1980.  The spectrum really broadened out, and the individual talents really shine on this LP.  Three tracks \\"Dreaming\\" \\"Union City Blue\\" and \\"Shayla\\" for me prove their mastery of song writing.  \\"Shayla\\" has the most haunting and spine tingling guitar to begin the track, which if Stein had done nothing else, would be good enough alone to say what a refined ear he had for melody and chords.  Harrys' voice is equally haunting and yet soft as cotton wool.  \\"Union\\" is my all time favourite Blondie track.  Clem Burke drums his way into stardom on this track alone, and with the thundering drum backing, Blondie achieve that \\"wall of sound\\" and echo, which is reminiscent of Phil Spector.  Steins' guitar and Harrys' voice perform magical chord changes, making this a very powerful magnetic song.  \\"Dreaming\\" begins the LP and we are immediately treated to Burkes powerhouse drumming which continues its crushingly fast beat till the end while Harry deftly skips a melody over the power backing and shows her skill at riding the beat, catching every beat and sweeping you along the way.<br />After \\"Eat\\" Blondie got caught up in the rap and dance scene too much for me to stay with them.  So if you like the early music up to \\"Parallel Lines\\" don't forget to get this as well, you will not be disappointed.<br />I would not catch up with Debbie Harry and Chris Stein until 1989 with \\"Def, Dumb & Blonde\\".  Back with Dave Chapman again as co-producer, this re-vitalised my love for them again, and it remains a master hit in my collection.
1572522232|4.0|I don't know what I expected from this film...I've seen one Argento film before this, and I must have forgotten that the most important thing in his films is not plot but style. The music is intensely creepy, the lighting is enough to drive you nuts, and several of the scenes made me jump. Not to mention that I'll never forget some of the scenes as long as I live (raining maggots, anyone?) In other words, the film is effective and very impressive--who needs a solid plot anyway?

B0000634EV|2.0|I think Nola is one of the greatest heavy metal albums ever and I too was anticipating the next album.  I wish they waited 7 years more because this one was really disappointing.  First off, the production really [stinks] compared to the first one.  Someone said in one of the reviews that the drums were too loud.  I disagree, I think they weren't loud enough!  The other person probably had that opinion because the guitars sounded bad as well.  Vocals weren't as great either.  The production wouldn't have been much of an issue if the songs were better as well.<br />Who knows I remember that I didn't like the first one when I first heard it either.  Maybe in time it will grow on me.  I've only listened to it twice since I got it (like two months ago).  I hope the next one is better and doesn't take so long to put out.<br />Side note:  I saw them live just last week and they did rock although Phil Anselimo was zonked out of his mind.  I wish he could have been sober but they were still great.
B0000028M7|5.0|I am a 15 year old girl from South Carolina and I just recently bought the Alice in Chains &quot;Dirt&quot; cd. In my opinion it's odd for a 15 year old girl to be intrested in a grunge band such as Alice in Chains, but once I heard the songs lyrics and acoustics I fell in love with them. I think alice in chains are a true band because they wright from personal stories. My first favorite song from Alice in chains was &quot;Rooster&quot; which you can find on the dirt cd. I personally would definatly say go buy their cd because with Layne Staley's &quot;one of a Kind&quot; singing style and Jerry Cantrell's awesome acoustics it make &quot;Dirt&quot; a great cd.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Unfortunately I was not one of the lucky ones who got to see Moulin Rouge in the movie theaters. But when I did see it I was shocked on how good it is. Moulin rouge is an amazing, original movie by the amazing director Baz Luhrmann and the soundtrack matches the beauty of it. It's one CD that even my Mom and me can agree on, it's great. The only big disappointments are the two missing tracks, The Pitch and the Show must go on, you have to buy the 2nd album for those two (which I still have yet to do). Here's a breakdown of the tracks.<br />1. Nature Boy-David Bowie - Starting out as soft as a whisper and building up to as strong as thunder is a way I can think to describe this track. David Bowie once again shows how great he can be. Very good. 5/5<br />2. Lady Marmalade-The Ladies of Moulin Rouge - Not as good as the original and not something I'm into personally. I realize that it will be loved by many people who are more a fan of the R&B/pop mainstream but to me it's good to dance too and that's it. 2/5<br />3. Because we Can-FatboySlim -  Another Fatboy slim techno song with clips of Jim Broadbent mixed in. A catchy dance song that has somehow made it into a soft drink commercial, how odd. 3/5 stars.<br />4. Sparkling Diamonds-The Cast of Moulin Rouge - One of my favorite songs on the album. Nicole Kidman and others provide a great performance that you just have to sing along to. 5/5 stars<br />5. Rhythm of the Night-Valeria - Not really my kid of song. It's one of the two I have so skip over on the CD. 2/5 stars.<br />6. Your Song-Ewan McGregor - I swear I feel in love with this man when he sang this song. Ewan McGregor shows how wonderfully he can sing with this rendition or Elton John's hit, Your Song. Really, really good. Next to El Tango De Roxanne, my favorite song on the album. 5/5 stars<br />7. Children of the Revolution-Bono, Gavin Friday and Maurice Seezer - I've always been a fan of this song and was ecstatic to seen it portrayed so wonderfully in thisCD. 5/5 stars.<br />8. One Day I'll fly away-Nicole Kidman - Insanely short but insanely good. Nicole Kidman sings a sad but sweet song about flying away and leaving. 5/5 stars.<br />9. Diamond Dogs-Beck - I love Beck I really do. His remake of Davie Bowie's Diamond Dogs is a catchy alternative sounding song that has very little connection with the movie (Chocolat sings it if you remember). Although this is no Loser or Devil's Haircut it's still very good. 4/5 stars<br />10. Elephant Love Medley-Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor and Jamie Allen - Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman show off their vocal talents in this medley of popular love songs that comes straight from the movie. 5/5 stars<br />11. Come What May-Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor - A beautiful love theme sung by the movie's two main characters One of the songs where the CD version (which is different from the movies) is far better. 5/5 stars.<br />12. El Tango De Rozanne-Ewan McGregor, Jose Feliciano and Jacek Koman - There is only one word I can use to describe this song. Intense. Being one of my favorite songs on the album, I cannot listen to this enough.<br />13. Complainte De La Butte-Rufus Wainwright - Blink and you'll miss this song in the movie (it plays as Ewan McGregor is stepping off the train) but this little French song is very cute and worth listening to. 4/5 stars.<br />14. Hindi Sad Diamonds-Nicole Kidman & Cast - Another song from the movie where Nicole Kidman shows off her incredible vocals. 5/5<br />15. Nature Boy-David Bowie & Massive Attack - A short, kinda odd, techno song. A remix of Nature Boy. 3/5.
0393317552|5.0|My word, New Guinea is fruitful when it comes to research!  The year is now 1955 and Dr. Gajdusek is about to receive the Nobel prize for discovering mad cow disease in humans for the first time.  The New Guinea people call the disease 'kuru'.<BR>His co-researcher Dr. Zigas states, \\"Oh, blinded and made halt of mind!  By the cruel doctrine of racial prejudice!\\"  For he had been told that the New Guinea natives were savage cannibals.<BR>He found instead, however, that they were remarkably friendly and charmingly free of the inhibitions that afflicted the Europeans.  Their customary greeting was considerably more intimate than a handshake:  a standing embrace in which both men and women handled each other's genitals.<BR>\\"Even in the villages, among people who saw one another every day, hands were continually reaching out to caress a thigh, arms, and searching mouths hung over a child's lips or nuzzled a baby's peewee.\\"<BR>But back to Dr. Gajdusek.  As he moved about in the eastern Highlands of New Guinea, which comprised several thousand square miles of largely uncharted, mountainous terrain inhabited by warring tribes of cannibals, he discovered that the people believed that sorcerers could cast spells by stealing items intimately associated with their intended victims - their excrement or leftover scraps of food - binding it up in a 'magic bundle' with special pieces of bark, twigs and leaves, and burying it to the accompaniment of a chanted curse.  They punished suspected sorcerers with a ritual revenge called 'tukabu' - brutal murderous beatings, bashing in heads and crushing genitals with stones and wooden clubs.  Since the disease kuru was taking so many lives, suspicions were causing even more deaths unfortunately by ritual murder.<BR>Since more women and children came down with kuru than men, eventually it was realized that there were important differences in the way men and women practiced cannibalism.  Although older widows often attended the funerals of people to whom they were only distantly related, joining in the mourning rituals so they could catch a bite of the deceased afterwards, men rarely joined in the feast and when they did, they ate all the good parts, leaving the women and children only with the brains and other internal organs.<BR>These discoveries, of course, led to the recognition of the first cases of mad cow disease in humans and the Nobel prize.
B000000W9Z|4.0|This is a another inspired album by David Bowie. Different from the other records of the artist, as usually...<BR> A ficticious story of a detective(that can be D.Bowie) that mix the human race with aliens? I think so... But let's talk about music. \\"Outside\\" is an excelent production. The arrangements are superb (\\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson\\", the jazzy \\"A Small Plot Of Land\\", the strong \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\" or creative \\"We Prick You\\"). Of course that \\"Strangers When We Meet\\" is the obvious aproximation to the David Bowie of the 80's. It's the natural single of the record, a fantastic song. But the true pearl of \\"Outside\\" is the SUPERB and DRAMATIC \\"Derranged\\", one of the finest moments of Bowie's career, without any kind of doubt. A masterpiece, one of those rare moments that any artist would like to reach. <BR> \\"Outside\\" tells us the art of murder, and above all, the art of produce good and creative music. Why not 5 stars? Because the excessive number of tracks...

B00005JKL8|3.0|Actual rating : ***1\2 .<br />Before I decided to rent \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" , I'd thought to myself : \\"Eran , the summer is upon us , it's a very hot and dry evening , what could be better than watching a good action movie ? \\" . Was I right ! This film gave me exactly what I'd wanted - pure , well-done , often mindless action - but it has more to it .<br />Significance -<br />------------<br />Despite its nature , one must not assume this motion picture has no purpose , not by a long shot . My friends , this movie , as its name implies , takes in hand the very serious matter of a soldier that is caught in hostile territory and is counting on his government to come for the rescue . As one might predict , things do not develop smoothly , and our fallen hero has to wander around for quite sometime , because of political considerations .<br />This story has been told more than once in previous films , having \\"First Blood - Part II\\" as being the most famous , as far as I can remember : The U.S. government decided to leave Rambo behind at the rendezvous point on account of  , again , political reasons .<br />However , these occurrences are not just fiction and exist in reality as well , even in Israel ; Two years ago , in the early days of the second Intifada , the Palestinians , in \\"Yosef Grave\\" in the vicinity of Nablus, seriously wounded and surrounded a young Israeli soldier, named Madhat Yousef . I remember hearing the advancement of the Israeli endeavors in \\"doing something and bringing him safely home\\" . These efforts proved unsuccessful because the Palestinians wouldn't let the I.D.F evacuate him peacefully ...<br />I was afraid that all the kind of things you generally see in the above movies would become a harsh reality . As a nation , we didn't want to believe that the political agenda - of not wanting to escalate the conflict that was re-emerging , once again , by an engagement of a full-time military rescue mission -would prevail . Nevertheless , in reality bad things happen , and Yousef was left to die .<br />The Israeli government allegedly decided he was expendable , as both Rambo and this movie's pilot ; the inhuman consideration of cost versus utility indicated the price tag that would assure his rescue was too high ... I recall I couldn't believe it was happening : it was all like a bad dream I wanted to wake up from .<br />I believe these kind of desicions and impotent actions are sins and brutal-irresponsible betrayals . \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" points at the same direction , and goes the whole nine yards : it preaches that the men directly in charge must do everything , including disregarding superior commanders' and political leaders' direct orders to realize one of the Rangers' honorable mottos of \\"Never leaving behind a fallen comrade , no matter the odds or the enemy\\".<br />This is the main message of this film . Personally , I like this message , but don't know if it can really stand the test of reality . In Israel it didn't , hopefully for the last time . I assume one cannot judge a field commander since the price is so high as the film demonstrates eventually .<br />In the end , I do hope this story would give some food for thought to persons that could find themselves in similar situations in the future to come . If the film has managed to accomplish such end , it has surely been a lot more than the ordinary action flick .<br />The plot -<br />----------<br />At the first 15 minutes the movie touches the delicate issue of the frustration and boredom the American soldiers around the world go through being the police officers of the world , yet not engaging real combat or meaningful actions most of the time . The rest of the movie is dedicated to showing the severe consequences of such feelings .<br />Our hero is a Navy navigator (Owen Wilson) that during a regular flight patrol above Bosnia , decides to investigate suspected activity outside the course of his original mission (the consequence of the above feelings).

B000067CPX|4.0|Im not going to lie i think that hte album is a bit dissapointing for fans of Mothers milk etc. But i believe that like californication this album improves every time u listern to it and just gets better and better and, although sounding like a record you just listern to i think that it need sto be thought about to be truly appreciated.
0790729628|4.0|I understand why people prefer the DC version of this film,<BR>but personally i prefer the Philip Marlow style voice over<BR>of the theatrical version; i can certainly live without the<BR>happy ending of it though (which somehow reminds me of the <BR>complete destruction performed by USA networks on Brazil)<br />ideally, a single DVD would have both versions (like Dark<BR>Star)<br />I have both the theatrical and DC versions on VHS, but on<BR>balance prefer the theatrical - any chance of that getting<BR>released on DVD?
0446677450|1.0|For the uninitiated in properly managing their money, this is a dangerous book.  While much of the author's story is nothing more than an extended homily that preaches a do-it-yourself, get-rich-quick mindset, what little he does specifically recommend is mostly wrong.<br />You can almost pick a page at random in the book and come up with something that is silly, contradictory, or simply in error -- sometimes outrageously so.  An example is on page 66/67: <br />&quot;Rich dad went on to explain that the rich know that money is an illusion....  He talked about the gold standard that America was on, and that each dollar was actually a silver certificate.  What concerned him was the rumor that we would someday go off the gold standard and our dollars would no longer be silver certificates....  'When that happens, boys, all hell is going to break loose....'  We really did not understand what he was saying that day, but over the years it made more and more sense.&quot;<br />Kiyosaka hits the trifecta here.  He is wrong, contradictory and silly (but, thankfully, not illegal).  First, money is not an illusion.  Nations and people -- rich and poor -- cannot conjure it out of thin air.  But if money was an illusion as Rich Dad suggests it is, then why worry about it being taken off the gold standard?  And as the U.S. went off the gold standard in 1971 without the system breaking down, the author will have to explain how Rich Dad's comments &quot;made more and more sense&quot; over the years, when they should have made less and less.<br />This is an unimportant example, picked at random, and has more to do with economics than with personal finance.  But it's indicative of Kiyosaka's approach throughout the book.  On page 231, he writes, &quot;What I find funny is that so many poor and middle class people insist on tipping restaurant help 15 to 20 percent even for bad service and complain about paying a broker 3 to 7 percent.  They enjoy tipping people in the expense column and stiffing people in the asset column.  That is not financially intelligent.&quot;<br />The comparison is inapt.  15 to 20 percent on a meal (usually a pittance) and 3 to 7 percent (potentially a significant sum) brokering a real estate or stock deal is in no way comparable.  A person with some free time can significantly cut down their expenses by cutting out a broker if they so choose.  And why would anyone in their right mind pay a stockbroker 3 to 7% when you can get just as good of results or better for under 1%?<br />Kiyosaka's book is filled with landmines for the unwary.  I'm startled and a little frightened that it became a bestseller.  It's an example of how successful salesmenship of a personal finance book has absolutely no correlation to the quality contained in it.  If you feel you must buy it, look up John T Reed's well-researched and thorough evisceration of the author and his claims before you actually pull the trigger.
B000069HP6|1.0|YAWN! Not even the special effects can save this poorly written movie about a missing ship in outer space. Wooden dialogue (and acting) by Schell sinks the movie. The music is good but gets kinda annoying after awhile. Rated ZZZZ.
B000002KDS|5.0|Killer is Alice Cooper Group's Best album and one of the best Hard Rock Albums ever. It just rocks from cover to cover; Under My Wheels, Be My Lover, Halo Of Flies, You Drive Me Nervous, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah all are great rockers Dead Babies and Killer are classic Alice Cooper Groups Horror Rock. The was Alice Cooper at their Best.
0872860175|5.0|Ginsberg, an American icon of poetry, delivers his full capacity in this short collection of poems.  &quot;A Supermarket in California&quot; portrays a place where famous poets of past generations are shopping in convenience as they alienate Ginsberg and each other in their yielding to technology and progress.<br />HOWL is full of unrealized cravings for something that never came. Ginsberg relates to his reader that instead of satisfaction at ideals being realized, he must find contentment merely in his own &quot;nakedness.&quot;<br />It's a stellar glimpse into a genius of words that has come through our times.  It is a short read that any lover of words will appreciate.
B000002GKT|5.0|Humble Pie was an underrated band and this Live Album is one of the best live albums of the 70s if not ever. This is a must have for any serious 70s hard rock fan. Its worth twice the price alone just to have I don't need No Doctor Live. Steve Marriot was a hell of a good Rock and Blues Singer, Peter Frampton added so much to the vocal Harmonies and with his Guitar. The whole band is fantastic. Get this CD you won't be sorry.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I thought 'Make Yourself' was the best quality cd out there and it was true until incubus released 'Morning View' which pushed the limits of intelligent lyrics and musical materpieces.  It starts with 'Nice To Know You' a track that rightfully earns the spot as the first track.  It combines a slow rythm with rock and comes out with a song unmatched by any band and takes you through a varied sea of songs that will make you ooze with bliss<BR>and then people will say, you have bliss in your ear and then 'Aqueous Transmission' will evaporate you and let you fly and feel the boat under you in a river.
B000002AGN|5.0|I am not a huge jazz fan. The only jazz I own to this point are this cd and &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; by Miles Davis. I am listening to this cd as I write this review and am just mesmerized by it. My favorite groups in music are actually The Beatles and the Rolling Stones. I think the Beatles are the best rock group ever.<br />However, what the Dave Brubeck Quartet does here no rock band can touch. The notes sound very simple and complex at the same time. I can not explain it as I am not a &quot;musical expert&quot;. I can't imagine today that Paul McCartney or the Rolling Stones, much as I love their music, could ever compose a work like this. The recording always gives me a feeling of what 1950's New York might have been like. Hopping, jamming, the Village. Coffee houses and silver plated old time gelatin photos of the city scape fill my mind when I listen to this cd.<br />Time Out has to be one of the best recordings ever made. It is the best known piece here. It deserves every accolade it has ever gotten. I can't add anything further about it whithout repeating all the praise it has already gotten.<br />Blue Rondo A La Turk is probably the second best known piece here. It is currently being used in the Radio Shack commercials that are shown on tv.<br />The rest of the songs glide by whether you actively listen to them, or just sit back and sip coffee to them. The interplay of drums, bass, saxophone, and piano is amazing. I feel you can not listen to this music and not think that there is a God in the universe.<br />This cd, along with Abbey Road, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Kind of Blue, and Some Girls would be five of the best recordings of the 20th century. I would give these five to anyone who wanted to know why the 20th century was a great place to be.<br />Time Out simply stands the test of time.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Man this movie rulz!!!!<br />This i the best game movie ever.<BR>I did´t think it was this good but man i was wrong.<BR>This movie rocks all the way form the begining to the end.<br />I must buy this on DVD!!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is truly wonderful and anyone who disagrees with it on religious grounds is fooling themselves. This movie has as much to do with magic as Mary Poppins, and that is a classic. In time, this film will be right up there with the best. The performances are great across the board and the three main children hold up the almost three hour film with impeccable force. The movie is scary at times, like all the great children stories and movies (remember Willy Wonka and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang), but it is kept at a family level. The dvd is really cool but it could use alot more behind the scenes, although of course, a little of the magic would be gone if I knew how they did everything. Sometimes the imagionation is our greatest allie.
B000065U6O|2.0|Given the machinations of modern-day advertising, it is difficult to place oneself back in the 1940s and to try to understand why this film was ever considered to be the height of sophistication in propaganda. I suspect that the desire to claim victory over an evil and highly dangerous enemy after the war had a great deal to do with it.<br />Leni Riefenstahl has a great reputation as a film maker of propaganda, but so does Eisenstein, and Eisenstein did it twenty years earlier. Today's viewer is still overwhelmed by Eisenstein's genius, while Leni Riefenstahl's work is dated and often silly.
B000067CPX|2.0|I can't believe, that anyone who liked Blood Sugar Sex Magic or older albums of RHCP can identify with By the Way at all.<BR>All the great bass lines, drum grooves and guitar excesses have been taken away and are replaced by mellow, minimalistic songs...<BR>I am still a big fan of RHCP, but I would never go to a concert of this tour...<BR>I can't help it, but this album sounds like as if they lost a bet or something...
B00005RFVL|3.0|I bought this CD mainly on the strength of one song I heard from it, the moody and elegant &quot;One More for the Road&quot;, which Mr. Williams does to a T.  <BR>Listening to the rest of the album, however, I was expecting him to bring something of his own to the old swing songs popularized by the likes of Sinatra and Bobby Darin.  &quot;Mac the Knife&quot; and &quot;The Sea&quot; are two songs that Bobby Darin took for his own with very individualistic style and phrasing.  To my disappointment, though I have always liked the Darin versions (I am old enough that those were from my era.), Mr. Williams sang them exactly the same: the same phrasing, the same little jokes thrown in (Does he have any idea who Lotte Lenya was?), even the same &quot;Look out, old Mackie's back!&quot;.  He ought to have read/heard the originals, not just the recordings by the great song stylists of another era. Paying tribute to a singer one admires is one thing, copying his exact way of singing--no matter how well one does it--is quite another. <BR>I WILL listen to this album.  Mr. Williams does sing well, and the phrases he imitates were good the first time, and rhey are still good.  But the imitative quality of the music takes the edge off the pleasure.
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is a book that does its job well.  It entertains and keeps you turning the pages.  It is an easy read and doesn't take itself too seriously.  While there is certainly some of the darker aspects of life in this book (war, death, etc.), it by no means distracts from the more light hearted aspects of the book.  Don't get me wrong, you should go in expecting all the ingredients of an epic fantasy that most have come to expect.  However, you should not expect Tolkien or the intricate back drops of Robert Jordan.  This is a more concise, fast paced romp which I think most will appreciate.  So, buy it new or used, check it out from the library... whatever you have to do.  If you like fantasy and need something to take your mind off things, then pick Dragons of Autumn Twilight...you won't regret it.
B00001MXXH|5.0|If I could have driven a Ferrari, visited the sites of Chicago, dined at a fancy restaurant, and danced to the Beatles on a parade float, I might have skipped school more often.  <BR>Ferris Bueller, whom Matthew Broderick was born to play, is determined to have a good time.  He takes risks we couldn't imagine getting away with, and manages to escape each one with reputation and health unharmed.  The appeal of his story, one of John Hughes' greatest in his Shermer Series, is the fact that we wish we could be him.  Sure, his sister and the high school principal hate him, but he doesn't seem to care too much.  A kid with that much popularity and charisma should expect some jealousy from others.  <BR>Alan Ruck was perfectly cast as his neurotic best friend Cameron Frye.  After all, Ferris needed someone with a bit of rationality to balance him out (or at least to be his naive partner in crime).  While Broderick provides a lot of insight and clever dialogue, Ruck lends some slapstick humor.  Watch the scene where Cameron is sitting in his car, for example.  \\"I'LL GO, I'LL GO, I'LL GO, I'LL GO!\\"  He is also spotlighted in the film's premier dramatic moment when Cameron finally sums up his distant relationship with his father.  And that Ferrari?  May it rest in peace.<BR>Other comic relief comes from Jeffrey Jones as the evil Principal Ed Rooney.  Most of the laughs come at his expense though.  But hey, I might have laughed if my high school principal had been mauled by a dog and kicked the face by Jennifer Grey.  He is the antagonist who only gets what is coming to him.  <BR>\\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\" is a comedy that will probably never go out of style, even if the clothes and the posters on Ferris' wall reflect the spirit of the eighties.  As long as kids are making mischief, as long as teenagers and adults are playing hooky, and as long as principals look like [fools]while trying to exert authority, Ferris will always be a hero.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I thought the movie was great fun, with its two opposite story directions, ala From Dusk Till Dawn. I had the opportunity to meet the main cast during the Fangoria 2001 Convention so it was great to see them in the movie. Alot of the horror films coming out these days are a disgrace, but this one seems to want to hark back to an earlier time in horror (1970's), but the look of it is what comes through. The dialogue is geared to a more modern approach, but the sarcastic wit is kept to a minimum. The dvd has a great behind the scenes documentary, trailers and deleted scenes. Worth the price.
B00005O3VC|5.0|You need to be convinced? If you're here, you have some modicum of interest. Buy this now. Or be poked with the Soft Cushions.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I bought this tape back in 1989 when it was released....I didn't like it much then, but how I've changed my tune on this one.  Over the years it revealed so much.  All the reviews for this release are right on.  I have a ton of CDs and this is very likey one of my top three of all time!  I also want to mention the sound production and recording engineering that went into this (and all TFFs CDs, for that matter) are fantastic.....the contibutions here alone are noteworthy not to mention the music itself.  EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS FANTASTIC!  How often can you say that!
6303212379|5.0|This is the best movie ever!  I have seen it a million billion times and the movie still cracks me up.  It has adventure, romance, comdey, drama, and suspence all in one movie-what else could you ask for?  I recommend this movie to everyone!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is my favorite recording of RHCP's. The best word I can use to describe it is sweet. The record is introspective, mellow, melodic, and beautiful. Less punk/funk but that's no loss in my opinion. They are proving themselves as skilled, seasoned music makers. Nearly every song on this cd is excellent.
B0000399WI|2.0|This is indeed a negative review of this movie.<br />Most people will gasp at the fact that I didn't like this movie.  I wasn't even aware that this film has been considered \\"the greatest film of all time\\" when I saw it.  I was shocked to find this out.  <br />Shawshank Redemption is, by all accounts, a crowd-pleaser.  It features appealing characters, a sentimental view of its subject (in this case, prison life), a sweeping score, and a tidy ending.  This kind of film has \\"Best Picture\\" written all over it.  <br />But is it a good movie? <br />The truth be told, it's not.  Directed by Frank Darabont, the man who would later direct The Green Mile and the Majestic, this story about a man falsely sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife is utterly devoid of ambiguity and emotional truth, or realism about prison.  It is as idyllic and fitting-to-the-audience's-expectations as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  American History X this is not.  <br />The story of Andy Dufreshne, the convited man, is a story worth telling.  Steven King got it right in his short story-- \\"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\\"  In fact, I can't think of a more fitting example of how an adaptation fails to live up to the book's punch.  <br />Tim Robbins is excellent as Dufresne.  And Morgan Freeman is astonishing as Red, Dufresne's prison buddy.  But good acting cannot save a movie from a sentimental director.<br />The movie is schmaltzy, makes black and white portrayals of good and evil, and it is frequently boring in its slow stretches.<br />I \\"liked\\" this movie, but I can't swallow any of it.  It didn't challenge me or my thinking.  Minus the sentiment, the misteps in direction, or the vacancy of ambiguity, its lack of provoking thought is its fatal flaw.
B00000634J|4.0|How can you capture the definitive John Lennon in just 20 songs? It's difficult to find a Lennon collection that isn't just a complilation of everything you can hear on the radio anytime you turn to a classic hits station.  This one comes close, but doesn't quite hit the mark.  It includes many usually ignored selections such as Instant Karma, Jealous Guy and Cold Turkey;  but ignores some of his best protest classics such as I Found Out, Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People), God, and Gimme Some Truth (which are still relevant today); his deeper, more scathing commentaries on those around him like Steel and Glass and How Do You Sleep?; and his more personal revelations such as Scared and Isolation. His  major hits are included, as well as some lesser known classics, and if you're looking for a good representation of the classic John Lennon Top 40 this is it.  Nobody else's Top 40 includes such diverse and socially relevent material; but if you looking for a definititive collection of the best he has to offer, keep looking.
0385503954|2.0|I fell for the tantalizing literati buzz on this book hook, line and sinker.  While the author is certainly talented in his ability to craft prose that engage your tongue and mind at times, I felt the story lacked depth.  I did not \\"connect\\" with the plotline - in fact, I nearly gave up mid-stream.  The number of run-on sentences employed in the first section seemed cloying.  An English teacher would have slashed and burned an 8th grade essay with the same content.<br />I wasn't committed until about 75% of the way through and I did feel the story picked-up at that point. It became more engaging as the writing was much more crisp and compact.  However, by the time the pace picked-up, I felt the remainder was merely hurtling toward a quick conclusion.<br />So far, other readers I know (ranging in age from 16 - 60)share my sense of disatisfaction; can't wait for my book club discussion at the end of the month.<br />Bottom-line:  fulfilled my book club obligation; would have spent my $$$ on something else
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is a movie that requires you to watch it at least twice.  I love this movie!  The acting, writing, sets, and costumes are spectacular.  However, I can see how the easily-distracted or dull-witted would find this movie &quot;boring.&quot;  It is slow at times, but it is hilarious and incredibly intricate.  What a masterpiece!
B000002L7R|5.0|How do you follow up to \\"Purple Rain,\\" the best-selling album of 1984? Just ask Prince, and he'll likely give you this answer: \\"you don't.\\" Soon after Prince ruled the charts internationally with \\"Purple Rain,\\" a classic melange of funk and rock, expectations were ridiculously high, and following a mere 9 months since the release of that album, His Royal Badness threw us a curveball with \\"Around the World in a Day.\\" You want a sequel to \\"When Doves Cry?\\" Forget it. \\"Let's Go Crazy, part II?\\" That ain't gonna happen. Instead, he released a 9-track album of Beatles-inspired psychedelica, James Brown-flavored funk, and even some Eastern influences. The title track is one playfully trippy affair, with its African drums and Eastern vibes. We then proceed to \\"Paisley Park\\" and the single \\"Raspberry Beret,\\" which recall 1967 Beatles. But the album's two strongest parts, in my opinion, are when Prince lets up and gives us the funk. The brilliant \\"America\\" is one of Prince's most underrated tracks and has been often misinterpreted as a patriotic song. Give the lyrics a second read, and you'll see where he's really coming from. \\"Tamborine,\\" is also a great display of Prince's talents. It's a stripped down slice of funk, and, apparently, he plays every instrument on the song. Amazing stuff. Perhaps the most intriguing moment has to be \\"Temptation,\\" an eight-minute song devoted to one of Prince's most favorite topics: sex. Towards the end, he says in a spoken voice, \\"I don't know when I'll return.\\" Fortunately, he did, and continued to make great records. As a followup to \\"Purple Rain,\\" this album disappointed his mainstream following, but if you examine the album on its own terms, you will find that it has some of Prince's most inspired work. It sold only a fraction of what \\"Purple Rain\\" did, but it's a fun album and deserves a listen.
B00005JKDR|4.0|I know everyone loves Shrek, but I have to cheer for Monsters, Inc. Besides the great voices of John Goodman and Billy Crystal, I like the socially concerned plot line -- the environment. And, that little girl is just so perfect. Obviously the writers and artists know what four-year-old girls are like.
630330608X|4.0|After watching about 5 minutes of this video I am absolutely convinced of one thing:  Glenn Gould is an absolute dork.  I found it amusing how it took him a couple minutes just to say he basically re-recorded the Goldberg Variations because of new recording technology and his musical views had matured.  <br />His sort of quirky, pretentioius manner translates to his performance of Bach as you can easily call this the Goldberg Variations for piano and vocal accompaniment.  With his sometimes free hand flailing about, humming excessively and out of key, and in an exaggerated crouch with his nose a few inches from the keyboard he looks more like a mad scientist than a concert pianist.  The guy's a riot.  But I guess that's all part of his appeal.  <br />Anyways, it's all quite entertaining to say the least.  And of course anyone who's going to watch this video has already heard Gould perform this work and knows what to expect.  I was, however, somewhat surprised at his generous use of the damper pedal.  I always found his playing rather dry and percussive and never knew he used the pedal so much.  I suppose he incorporated it more during his latter years.  Still you get that kind of infectious percussive, rhythmically precise quality that's Gould's trademark.
B000000I02|5.0|This is nice and don't let anyone ever tell you any different. Ya, heah me ?
6305127638|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek movie of all nine currently on the market... This movie's got everything you could want. <br /> The acting is great, most notably from Patrick Stewart as the valiant Captain Picard, Alfre Woodard as Lily Sloane, and Alice Krige as the perfectly creepy Borg Queen. Nearly all of the crewmembers got good lines and moments (the only one whom I think was a bit stiffed was Crusher, but its always like that somehow), especially Deanna Troi. If you want a laugh, watch Chapter 12, it's great. Picard got some absolutely awesome lines and the scene between him and Lily in the readyroom is powerful stuff.<br /> Of course, the Borg are stupendous in this movie. They're downright scary at times, and the special effects have just the right amount of gruesomeness. Alice Krige as the Borg Queen is mysterious and creepy and plays off well with Picard and Data.<br /> Although it was a bit off-putting to some, Zefram Cochrane was portrayed as a drunk \\"hoodlum\\" more interested in money and wealth than scientific progress. His performance is interesting and the joke about \\"taking a leak\\" with Geordi is very funny.<br /> All in all, this was a great movie. It starts off right away with action, has fabulous acting, the lines are emotional, the humor is not forced or overdone, and, of course, the Borg make it just scary enough so that you may sleep with the lights on. <br />Best scenes: Deanna and Cochrane bum out over tequila, the assimilation sequence when the Borg are gunning down all of the defense checkpoints, the conversation between Lily and Picard in his ready-room, and Crusher's escape from sickbay.<br />Best lines: \\"It's a primitive culture. I'm just trying to blend in.\\" \\"You're blended, all right.\\" (Deanna and Will)<BR> \\"If you want my professional opinion as ship's counselor: he's nuts.\\" (Deanna)<BR> \\"I'm a doctor, not a doorstop.\\" (EMH/Voyager's doctor)<BR> \\"They destroy our ships, and we fall back. They conquer entire worlds, and we fall back. Butnot this time, the line must be drawn HERE.\\" (Picard)<BR> \\"Don't you people from the twenty-fourth century ever pee?\\" (Zefram Cochrane)<br />Rated PG-13 for language, sci-fi violence (phasers), and sensuality (Data and the Borg Queen, eeww).<br />Special features: Two trailers (theatrical and teaser) and different selections in language. Watch it in French, its a riot. And look for glimpses of the Enterprise-D, \\"Generations\\", and the episode \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" in the teaser trailer.
B000002C1V|4.0|And that's fair enough.  It goes further than &quot;The Wall&quot; down the road of departure from the light shows and slow, introspective music that made the band so popular.  Further, it doesn't have the mainstream appeal or the catchy FM-radio tracks that the previously mentioned album had.  It doesn't have a movie adaptation (although I think that one was intially intended) like &quot;The Wall&quot; either.<br />After saying all of that and noting all of the conflict between Waters and Gilmour at the time this was produced, who cares?  THIS IS STILL AN EXCELLENT ALBUM.  You can't jump right into it; you probably won't like it that much the first time you hear it.  I didn't.  But give it a couple of chances.  It really grows on you.<br />As I said in my title, it's not typical.  If you're new to Pink Floyd, you don't want to start here.  If you want to call this is a Roger Waters solo album, then it's his best.  You can thank Gilmour for that.  I would equate this effort with &quot;Piper At the Gates Of Dawn&quot; in terms of departure from what most people expect of Pink Floyd.  A lot of people like &quot;Piper At the Gates Of Dawn&quot; (I don't) and a lot of people like this album (obviously, I do).  The difference between the two albums besides the vastly different styles of music is that this one is much more melodic and focused.

B00001QGPR|3.0|This album marks a return by David Bowie to his 70's glam rock period. There are some good tunes on this album, notably &quot;Thursday's Child,&quot; &quot;The Pretty Things are Going to Hell,&quot; and &quot;Seven.&quot; Bowie's voice is strong, as usual, and there are some tuneful backing tracks. This album has its low points as well, like the unremarkable closing track, &quot;The Dreamers&quot; and some strange-but-not-necessarily-bad instrumental tracks like &quot;New Angels of Promise.&quot; Although this doesn't rank with Bowie's best, it is certainly not an embarrasment.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is proubly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I laughed so much that I thought I was going to die. Brad Pitt's accent and character really tip things off. I recomend this to anyone. It's totally hilarious in a dark sort of way. Dennis Farrina is also increadibly funny. I highly recomend this to anyone wanting a really good laugh. Also, have a large amount of sugar intake before you watch this movie, you won't be able to stop laughing. Believe me, its worth it.
B00005JL3A|4.0|This movie is the coolest action/slash horror ever.  The special effects are wonderful.  The movie features the beautiful Milla Jovovich.  There are only a few strong gory parts.  For example, the scene in the laser hallway where half of the team gets sliced into bits.  The part that creeped me out alot was when the zombie with the messed up foot was dragging the ax.  That was freaky.  There is also a bonus in the movie.  Guys keep your eyes peeled in the beginning for a well-worth shot of Milla.  The movie strays away from the game quite a bit.  But otherwise, great movie.
0064407667|4.0|After reading the first couple chapters of this book, I started getting the feeling that the book really was completely bleak and depressing with no happiness whatsoever. Life just kept getting worse and worse for the three Baudelaire siblings. Bad enough their house burned down, killing their parents. Then they have to endure itchy clothing, cold oatmeal, and an evil greedy villian after their money. I started to think that perhaps I should heed Lemony Snicket's warnings, and put down the book in favor of something light and happy. However, the closer I got to the end, the more the story grew on me. Even though horrible things happen to the Baudelaires, there are some bright spots. I found myself anxious to read more, just to see if maybe they triumph over their misfortune. It's not entirely fun, but it's fascinating. And I think it has a great underlying message about the strength of family. Well, that's not entirely true since the evil Count Olaf was part of their family. But the siblings rely on each other and love each other very much, and that made me feel all warm and fuzzy.
B000065V1V|4.0|This is really good. Bowie continues the return to his 70's style that started with Hours but this is better. The album starts off with the ominous &quot;Sunday,&quot; which sports a very heavy sound followed by the catchy and accessible &quot;Cactus.&quot; The best tracks on the album are the memorable &quot;Slow Burn&quot; and &quot;A Better Future.&quot; Also notable are &quot;Slip Away&quot; and &quot;Everyone Says Hi.&quot; The lower points are &quot;I've Been Waiting For You,&quot; and &quot;The Angels Have Gone&quot; but they are far from unlistenable. Definitely worth owning and a must-have for those who were fans of Bowie before its release.
B000067CPX|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers have once again displayed their great talent and range in their newest album. I bought it a few days ago on vacation, and have been listening to it non-stop. It is definitely one anyone should buy. What makes the peppers great is they're constantly evolving their sound, trying some new styles, which is a big hint that this band will stay rocking for a long time. Here's my rundown on the tracks (note: because of By the Way, the greatest song, some tracks may appear bad, but a very high majority of them aren't). Out of a possible 5 stars (asterisks*):<br />*****: Should-be Chart-topper ****: Excellent Song<BR>***: Good Song **: Not my Favorite *: Skip It<br />1. !!!!! By The Way: Perhaps their best song since Around the World, my selection of the CD. Great rhythym and harmony, really a catchy song. A mix of rap and rock. Guitar's great, and Chad is solid on the drum set. *****+ <br />2. Universally Speaking: Good song. Anthony shows his great range in both types of songs and voice. ***<br />3. This is the Place: Again a good song. A dark sounding rap/rock. Only swear on the CD at the end. Catchy verses and chorus (the whole song), especially at the end. I'd have to say the harmony is, for the first time, somewhat weak, except in the \\"flashing ray\\" verse. ***<br />4. Dosed: Ahhh...uuuh...yeah...I don't mean to be rude, but not my favorite. It is an okay song for teenage girls. All pop, little rock. The weakest on the album, and they released it?. *+<br />5. Don't Forget Me: Interesting chorus, although put in late. A great song, though, good rhythm. Listen to it. ****<br />6. The Zephyr Song: I like the verses a lot, but not particually the chorus. In case you were wondering, it means some type of wind. **+<br />7.!!!!! Can't Stop: What to say? Awesome song, second favorite. Another rap/rock combo, but mixed in. The verses are solid and, although played a lot, not the least bit overused. The harmony is, as usual, great as well as the rhythm. The ending is different, and the middle is distinctive. *****<br />8. I Could Die For You: Despite its slow appearance, it's great. Interesting, sincere, lyrics. Can't think of much to say, just that its good. ***+<br />9. Midnight: Well then. If RHCP lost the cellos and stupid spooky sounds in the long beginning, it would be a good song. It doesn't make much sense, though. But other people seem to like it. **+ <br />10.Throw Away You Television: Right.... Rap/rock combo again. Great philosophy at points by Kiedis, but not the strongest song. **+<br />11. Cabron: Not suited for mainstream radio, but has become a favorite for many, especially on the west coast. RHCP basically substitutes Spanish for Rock. Not my favorite. Okay verses, but the chorus is long and annoying at times. ***<br />12. Tear: Excellent song with many good points and strong verses. ****<br />13. On Mercury: More Spanish, but still okay. Strong beat. It seems like there are a few pre-verses. ***<br />14. Minor Thing: If you watch MTV's \\"Jammed\\" you've already heard it. A little short (about 1:45 of singing), but a great song. Good rhythm. One of my favorites. ****+<br />15. Warm Tape: Synth sounds and echos are annoying, but an okay song, I guess. **+<br />16. Venice Queen: Nice song, a fitting ending to a great album. But I would have liked to have seen, or rather heard, a harder rock song to close. ***<br />A few minor notes: <br />-Flea doesn't have enough solos<BR>-RHCP should lose the synth sounds and strings. I'm positive their live performances will likely be twice as good than the recorded versions, since they'll have to ditch the noises for good old guitars <BR>-Overall the CD doesn't have as hard of an edge as BSSM or Califorication, but comprised of mostly of the previous rariety ballads<BR>-Overall great rhythm, harmonies<br />In conclusion, I'd have to say that RHCP have completed yet another great album which is sure to sell millions, deservedly so. Hopefully, fans will accept theirnew style.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|If you're a fan of war film's, action and suspense, U-571 is what you're looking for!  While this film is not much as far as the historical value, who care's.  This film does exactly what everybody involved with it set out to do, entertain.  It has a clearly defined plot line and carries through with it in a splendid manner.  The depth charge scene was particularly explosive (no pun intended, yea right).  Matthew McConaughey does a wonderful job in this film.  Starting off as the efficient officer that's not quite ready for command and then transforming, due to circumstances, into a battle hardened leader of sailors.  Overall I would recommend to this film to anybody!  The special features included on this DVD are exceptional as well.
B000067CPX|4.0|It's great to hear that the chile peppers are back toghether. By the Way is a good chilli peppers album, though not on the same level as blood sugar sex majic and californication. There are still some great songs on the album like the tital track, can't stop, don't forget me, this is the place, on mercury and minor things. There are some interesting songs like on mecruray and carbon that have this Mexican-Hispanic vibe to them which adds to the chillis pepers's mix of rock, rap and funk and shows that the band is still pushing its sound in new directions. I just hope I don't have to wait another three years for the next pepper's album.
B00005J6T1|5.0|1.  Lucky Star- cute little song that was the biggest song on the album.  Fun to listen to, and more fun to sing along.<br />2.  Borderline- my favorite song on this album.  The hooks are irresistible, and this song is incredibly catchy.<br />3.  Burning Up- Upbeat song full of sexual energy, although you have to listen to the lyrics to hear it.<br />4.  I Know It- Pretty good song.  Like it more now than I did in the beginning.<br />5.  Holiday- Very fun song, which would later be a Madonna standard.<br />6.  Think Of Me- perhaps the most vocal song on the whole album.  She may not have been Whitney, but she had a range.<br />7.  Physical Attraction- one of the slowest songs on the album.  Very good.<br />8.  Everybody- It's a good song, even if it isn't very catchy.<br />This is a Madonna album, so of course it is a must have!
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Unfortunately I cannot rate the DVD itself as I, happily, do not own it.  I have, however, had the misfortune of seeing the movie and can say without a trace of remorse that this movie is abyssmal.  There are so many solid time travel movies around. From the cryptic, beautiful, and thought provoking 12 Monkeys to the light-heartedness of movies like Back to the Future and Tenchi Muyo in Love.  Even Terminator 2 had fewer plot holes or, at the least, excuses itself from reality with genuine entertainment.  I can't recommend this movie less, even with it's stunning special effects and reasonable cast.  Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons are usually dependable fellows but they seem to be stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|This could very well be the best disc ever made. As for the movie, either you love it or hate it & no one will change your mind. But it is technically spectacular & the bonus features including hour long History Channel documentaries make it worth the price even if you never watch the movie. The R rating, directors cut is for about 60 seconds of additional war gore that makes the movie a bit more tolerable for those who believe the love story angle is emphasized too much. The only special feature on disc #1 with the first couple hours of the movie could be the most important 2 minutes on any of the 4 discs. It is titled \\"Why letterbox\\". Disney gives a short course on how much more you see with those evil little black bars that people dislike. They show everyone that you get more, MUCH MORE, when you get a movie in widescreen. Would that all Disney movies filmed in ws were put on dvd that way...
B00004SCX6|5.0|Of all the \\"cheap 90s pop\\" artists that people love to hate, Britney Spears is the best. Her first album was nothing notable, but this one flat-out rocks. \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Stronger\\" are each single-handedly worth this CD's weight in gold, having the best melodies AND the best lyrics of any 90s pop songs I've heard. The title track is basically a remix of a Barbra Streisand song, as is \\"What You See;\\" however, both of them have WAY more interesting lyrics than the original, and a better beat. Her remake of \\"Satisfaction\\" rocks every bit as much as the Stones version, if not more so.<br />And while her voice is not the best, it's still good, and she DEFINITELY knows how to use it. I can almost hear her cry during some songs (especially \\"Lucky\\"), and she really puts some force behind it in others, like \\"Satisfaction.\\"<br />Some of this album's songs are bland, but the best tracks are good enough to give this a 5-star rating.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|I guess from all the critical acclaim, I was expecting a little more from this movie.<br />A few issues jump to my mind:  <br />First, I just cannot see Will Smith AS Ali; it looks to me like  Will Smith is IMITATING Ali.<br />Second, the after watching the first hour of the movie, I couldn't tell if I was watching a movie about Muhammad Ali or Malcolm X.  You get the feeling the director is making up for the fact that he didn't get to direct the Autobiography of Malcolm X.<br />Third, the movie shows a snapshot of 10 years in Ali's career.  There is little background and little resolution, as you would expect in such a snapshot.<br />And, to top it off, you just get the feeling the movie could have been done in about half the time, for all you get out of it.<br />In the end, you don't get much of an impression of Ali that you didn't already know, and the relevant fight scenes have already been done better.  &quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, or even HBO's movie on Don King give a better treatment of Ali in the ring than this flick.
B00005J9M0|3.0|You can get Pet Shop Boys albums with two or three times as many songs for a dollar or two less than this. Do it.<br />Good music, though.
B00003CX95|4.0|BRAVEHEART is a lavish production. It depicts medieval warfare fairly accurately in all its bloody glory. Moreover, William Wallace was a real-life Scottish folk-hero. On the other hand, the events shown here have little relation to actual historical events and the graphic bloodiness is almost overwhelming. The end is a visual tribute to man's creativity in finding ways to inflict ghastly physical pain on his fellow man. I watched this once, found it quite interesting, and have no desire to repeat the experience. As a cinematic effort, though, it is beautifully done. If you like lots of blood and gore, you'll love this movie. If not, steer clear.
B000002UZ4|5.0|These guys are true musical geniuses. For the most part, anyway. The first 12 tracks are wonderful, hitting a high point with \\"Opportunities\\". Come on, sing the chorus with me! \\"I've got the brains, you've got the looks, let's make lots of money! You've got the brawn, I've got the brains, let's make lots of money!\\" They have some wierd stuff in here, such as a remix of an Elvis song and another song that they wanted to sound \\"Latin\\". And it ALL sounds good. Tracks 13 and 14 are okay, and 15-17 [are] just plain [bad], but then they get good again with their last track, which is among their best.<br />These guys are great.
B0000399WI|3.0|Gees, I'm going to get caned for saying this, aren't I.<br />The Shawshank Redemption has always been pegged as a great movie - clearly the Amazon.com readership thinks so - and I finally got round to seeing it last night.<br />It's definitely a engaging film; beautifully shot, well enough acted and it resolves itself quite nicely (if not a little obviously - the \\"twist\\" was so predictable it may as well have been Chubby Checker). But to my mind, the Shawshank Redemption never rises above simply \\"satisfactory\\".<br />With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at the helm, it was always going to be a worthy sort of picture. Alas, it scores worthiness points in that numb-skulled Hollywood way, by painting the moral world in black and white. The characters are either completely virtuous, or they're thoroughly nasty. That makes the moral lesson easy to preach, but also completely undermines it, because we know the real world just isn't like that. Well, mine isn't, anyway.<br />To wit: the prison gang into which wrongly convicted (of course - but how much better would the picture have been had he actually done it?) Andy Du Fresne falls - lifers, all - comprises only genuinely nice, decent, hard working, obedient folk.<br />Freeman's character, Red, is an avuncular figure not a million miles from B. B. King, but who is continually, inexplicably, rejected for parole by the nasty white folk. He accepts his lot without complaint (but when he finally does speak his mind, he gets released!) Old timer Brooks (equally avuncular, but this time not a million miles from namesake Mel) is eventually paroled, but he doesn't want to leave his home of 50 years, and when pushed out in to the cruel modern world ... well, I don't want to give anything away. But it isn't hard to guess.<br />The remainder of the moral lessons are the standard Hollywood fare; it's a film that attempts the epic sweep of The Dead Poets' Society, without the lyricism (but, to its credit, also without Robin Williams) and attempts to portray the brutal life of prison, without the brutality of say Sleepers.<br />The hook line \\"you get busy livin', or you get busy dyin'!\\" is pure schmaltz, and I'm surprised Robbins didn't refuse point blank to deliver it. And if that wasn't bad enough, then Freeman reprises the line (only tacking on  \\"that's goddamn right!\\") as the credits roll. Ugh.<br />And just for those who hadn't picked it up from watching the film (or reading its title), the director helpfully gushes \\"it's all about redemption!\\" in a fairly unenlightening accompanying documentary.<br />The resolution of the film may be predictable, but the manner of its arrival is nicely engineered: well plotted, Stephen King.<br />And as for ending up in Zihuatanejo - great call; it's a truly beautiful place - I once went there. It's just a pity the film crew didn't. Zihuatanejo is snuggled amongst some hills in a pretty little inlet, about a hundred miles west of Acapulco. Lord only knows, then, why they filmed the final shot on an outwardly curving ocean beach, which could be anywhere on the planet BUT Zihuatanejo...attempts to portray the brutal life of prison, without the brutality of say Sleepers.  <br />The hook line \\"you get busy livin', or you get busy dyin'!\\" is pure schmaltz, and I'm surprised Robbins didn't refuse point blank to deliver it.

B00005OM4N|4.0|I thought Britney would never be able to top \\"Lucky\\" and \\"Stronger\\". This album has made me rethink her talent. The first track is so horrible, both musically and lyrically, that I refuse to call it by name, instead referring to it as \\"That stupid slave song\\" - so, naturally, it got the most publicity. The other tracks are much better. \\"Overprotected\\" has a good tune and awesome lyrics; \\"I'm Not a Girl\\" is one of the best slow songs I've ever heard; \\"What it's Like to be Me\\" is her upbeat and enjoyable retort to all the people who hate her without even knowing her. Not all of the songs are good - \\"Boys\\" is almost as bad as the stupid slave song - but the good tracks make this CD well worth buying.
0312265859|2.0|I know writing this review will yield a lot of negative responses but I can't let my feelings go unheard.  I have previously read and enjoyed the Stephanie Plum mysteries (1 through 7) and in my opinion (which I never dreamed I'd say), \\"it's time for Stephanie to get a new job\\". <br />I waited an entire year to find out what would happen with Stephanie and Ranger/Stephanie and Morelli and what did I get -- disappointed.<br />You would figure after 8 outings Stephanie would at least have become more competent in her line of business but the character remains clueless. <br />Why does every novel have to explain how Stephanie met each person, i.e. Morelli, Ranger, Lula, etc.? Those entries take up a good 20 pages explaining what we already know. <br />Why keep rehashing events from the previous novel, i.e. the funeral home getting burned down, someone getting murdered on the fire escape. The moments were funny the first time around but it becomes a little stale repeating it over and over again.<br />Nothing new really happens in Hard Eight, it's the same old thing: Ranger/Morelli comes to the rescue, Stephanie loses another car, dead bodies end up in her apartment, Stephanie can't find the bullets to her gun, etc.<br />Hard Eight adds up to thing:  It's time to MOVE ON Janet, this series has run out of steam.
B000002J09|5.0|Yep, this is THE same album you listened to back in High School. Black Dog, Levees Breaking and Stairways to heaven as you're going to California. It's all there.<BR>  You know exactly what i mean don't you? Only now, the songs are crisper, there is no skip on the album and you can even hit &quot;random play&quot; and leave yourself open to fate.<BR>  If you own just ONE Led Zeppelin album, (and who doesn't??) Make the jump to CD for this one. Trust me, you WILL enjoy the jump to the new millenium of compact discs.
0792165020|4.0|I was very surprised that I liked this movie!!  It is one of the best faux Hitchcock films I have ever seen.  The film's publicity  was misleading, it made it seemed like Matt Damon's character was much more predatory and ruthless than he is in the actual film.  In fact, Mr. Ripley unintentionally falls into his life of deceit and crime in true film noir form (the movie this film most reminded me of was the low-budget noir classic DETOUR, I guess this is the uptown version).  Matt Damon is excellent and this was the biggest surprise for me.  I thought GOOD WILL HUNTING was very overrated and that his performance in that particular movie was very TV-movieish so I avoided his later films but he gives a multi-faceted performance here. Gwyneth Paltrow was excellent and I really enjoyed Cate Blanchett whom I have never seen before.  She is lovely and more likable and warm than most actresses who play upperclass women. I'm hoping she becomes a major film star here in America.<br />I am going against the tide I guess, but I thought Jude Law was rather mediocre.  He exudes a decadent smarminess here that just doesn't seem appropiate for the character who should be something of a heartless, All-American golden boy. Philip Seymour Hoffman is worse, playing his part with a hamminess that is out of synch with the acting of the rest of the cast (as well as a cartoonish &quot;rich boy&quot; accent that sounds like Jim Backus' Mr. Howell from Gilligan's Island).<br />Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the movie.  The ending was a surprise but quite credible given Ripley's ultimate mindset; he was quite capable handling people who were indifferent or patronizing to him by lying through his teeth, but with all his self-hatred having two people  who seemed to want to love him threw him as much as having found himself still caught in a web he had escaped.<br />The movie is a little long (I would have cut the jazz club scene which serves no real purpose) but I was never bored.bored.
B00005J6UP|3.0|I love the Goonies because it is a great movie. But one thing I really hated about the DVD was the fact that not all the deleted scenes are on it. Everyone says they are most likely lost but then again you see them turn up on Disney and all the bootlegs in good quality. Also for all you fans out there, the snack and shop scene is not the full thing. It stops right in the middle of Brand yelling at Mikey. On Disney and the bootlegs it shows Mouth steal the map from Brand's pocket again and then the kids run off. So all in all, the DVD isn't all that great. The only good thing is pretty much the commentary.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I admit, not everyone appreciates a song and dance. But Moulin Rouge was an amazing movie none the less. I did find the ending kinda similar to Titanic, and while I did enjoy poking a little fun at their misfortune, at no point was I not in tears at how heart wrenching it was! This movie states a very valuable lesson within the first five minutes! \\"The greatest thing is to love and be loved in return.\\" Call me a romantic (cause I am) but it's very poignant. My only criticism, and this was not important enough to detract from the rating I gave it; was that the songs were indeed, not original. But, pop culture or not, this movie is very thought provoking and will teach the open of mind a few important things to know. ...
0345350472|4.0|I re-read this novel recently, as I used it in my \\"What Is Humanity?\\" class in conjunction with the movie based on it, Blade Runner. As a longtime fan of Dick, I had read this quite some time ago, and still remembered quite a bit of it, so in this re-reading, I concentrated on the similarities and differences between it and the movie. In my memory, I thought that the two were quite different, and on the surface, they are. This is because the movie is but a subset of the book--the screenwriters took what they thought was the dramatic heart of the novel, but they didn't necessarily discard the rest. It's still there, surprisingly, but it is sublimated in images and character asides.<br />Yes, it's a pulp novel. But Dick was a warped mind, and this is one of his best books of the \\"middle period\\" of work, between the science fiction where he honed his craft and before he moved into the metaphysical territory of his last novels (in particular, the VALIS trilogy). If you like this book, you owe it to yourself to try UBIK and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which are my picks for the best of the pulp novels.
B000068TPN|2.0|Briefly, this movie is poorly conceived on a number of levels.  First, contrary to certain reviews, this movie IS about the politics as well as the tactical and operational realities of the Vietnam War, and any reviewer who tries to separate the two should check out Clausewitz's On War.  More to the point, it is (mostly) a whitewash of the terrible futility of the sacrifices that so many Vietnam veterans made due to the political incompetence of our government, while simultaneously a reversion to the old Hollywood tendency to glorify the way war and infantry combat are depicted.  Second, it is almost entirely cliche; there is not an original line or character in the movie.  Third, it is somewhat misleading about the historical facts of the battle for the Ia Drang Valley.<br />First, the movie does get involved in the politics of the war.  It does a fair job of portraying the innocence of American soldiers before they were deployed, and it has an excellent (but brief) portrayal of the political sensitivity to casualties and the degree to which the war was micromanaged.  However, the movie almost completely sidesteps the fact that the Vietnam War was a war without a purpose.  The soldiers in the Air Cavalry, and for that matter every other unit in Vietnam, fought and died for no clearly-defined purpose, and as such their heroic sacrifices were as futile as any in the history of war.  The only hint of this in the movie is a single line at the end of the film by the North Vietnamese Army commander (which I shall omit for the benefit of those who haven't seen the movie).  The rest of the movie ignores the futility of the sacrifices made by the Americans, and while this may help us to appreciate the heroism of the individual soldiers on that day, it insulates us to the incompetence and dereliction of duty of which the political leadership was guilty.<br />On a less esoteric level, the movie tends to depict infantry combat in an overly-sanitized manner.  I am an infantry combat veteran of the Gulf War and served in the 101st Air Assault Division.  The movie does almost nothing to accurately depict the effects that modern arms, particularly artillery, has on soldiers' bodies.  Furthermore, the movie gives the impression that soldiers under fire continue to execute their missions with stoicism and professionalism.  This is simply untrue.  Even in the American military of today, which is far more professional than it has ever been, the majority of infantry soldiers become ineffective and cannot pursue their objectives or engage the enemy after more than a few minutes of exposure to fire similar to that depicted in the movie.  The movie did not show that.  For a far more realistic depiction of infantry combat, see Saving Private Ryan.<br />The movie was also somewhat historically inaccurate.  The movie gives the viewer the impression that the entire battle of the Ia Drang Valley occurred in the vicinity of Landing Zone X-Ray.  As to the events that occurred in LZ X-Ray, the movie is accurate in a chronological sense.  The deployment of units, the geographical features, and the order of battle was done fairly well.  However, there were several other landing zones and several other battalions fron the Air Cav that were not shown.  In fact, at one point in the movie a map seems to indicate that the only active landing zone in the entire area was LZ X-Ray.<br />Finally, the entire script could have been taken directly from a 1960s-era John Wayne war movie.  I do not recall a single original or believable line from the entire movie.  The characters were all idealized and one-dimensional, and the direction tended to glamorize the action.  [WARNING - spoiler coming]  As an example, it has one of the oldest cliches of war movies: it introduces a young, idealistic soldier to the audience and acquaints the audience with the soldier's wife and new baby, only to kill the soldier later in the movie.  This has been a part of just about every bad war movie (and, I admit, some good ones - see Platoon) since war movies have been made.  As soon as I was introduced to the young soldier and learned of his new baby, I knew that he would get it later on.  Indeed, he was killed in one of the other great cliches of war movies - trying to drag one of his wounded soldiers back to cover under fire.  [OKAY - spoiler over]<br />In short, my opinion is that this movie was a retread of the bad old days of war movies that glorified war and whitewashed both the realities of combat and the politics of Vietnam in particular.  I wish to reiterate that I do NOT seek to disparage the individual American soldiers who served in Vietnam to any degree - no one will deny the heroism and sacrifice of them, particularly in the face of their government's betrayal.  Rather, I think that the realities of the Vietnam War, and of war in general, were glorified and oversimlified in the movie, and I cannot recommend it.  Rather, I recommend Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line for good war movies in general, and Platoon and Apocalypse Now for the Vietnam War in particular.
0783240236|5.0|This DVD celebrates Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds' with an excellent transfer &amp; a delightful &amp; absorbing array of special features. In a word: Magnificent. The only additional comment is the recommendation that viewers enjoy the brilliant &amp; insightful book Camille Paglia devoted to this cinematic triumph.
B00005RIKD|1.0|OH MY GAWD! What a dog of a project. I don't really care when it was recorded, because the only thing that matters to me is if I would listen to this CD over and over. <br />I don't think so. I struggled the first time I listened. If these songs went any slower, they would go backwards. This is not jazzy or sexy, but boring. I very much like what sting has done with his work over the years. A true talent that pushes his talents into new territory, but this little number fails miserably. If I was at this concert, I would have been [angry]. <br />Avoid this altogether.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Tomb raider was a fun action packed movie. The casting was great and the small cameos and touches were of good effect. Angelina Jolie truely fit this feisty character of computerized fiction. I loved the grace of her stunts and the pull of the other actors on her. Small roles such as the butler were to be applauded, they gave us small insight on her character and a good laugh as well. All around the storyline kept me interested and I was twice as entranced as I was by just playing the game. I would reccomend seeing this movie if only for  quick peek into a computer game that was transformed wonderfully.
6301735048|5.0|I was 18 years old when I watched this movie...and it left me crying at the end. This was one of the greatest love stories I ever seen, after the &quot;Ghost&quot; with Patrick Swaizy (spel?). I was clicking through movie channels on TV and happened to see this movie on. So, I left it and watched it. I decided to give it a chance since I like Kevin Costner a lot as an actor. And guess what? I watched it till the end and could not even take my eyes of the screen. If you love romantic stories -this is the movie for you. It is rated R but when it comes to love scenes they  are elegant and refined and will only leave you thinking that there is another side to making true love. I also enjoyed the great music throughout the movie, it defined its style. I will have to say &quot;Revenge&quot; will make you think psychologically about different human relationships. This will not be the movie to laugh, but to cry. I was very surprised that it had only 2.5 stars, I guess it is just one of those &quot;untouched and undiscovered&quot; movies. This is definitely worth watching, you will not regret and you will have good time. Every actor did an exellent job playing his/her part. The only thing I did not like was the ending, but maybe this is the final twist to the plot- maybe this is how it should be. To understand what I mean by &quot;it&quot;, watch the movie and be sure you have a kleenex box near by!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I really love this CD. My favorite song on the CD is &quot;Video&quot;. I think that song really empowered girls to look at themselves positively, instead of not accepting ourselves the way we are. &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; brings out all of the moods you're in. Her CD motivated me to accept myself as I am and have more confidence. I also love her style and the style of the CD. I can't wait till she comes out with her sophmore album.
0783225903|5.0|The first thing I must notice is that the people who gave this movie 1 star in their review said nothing about the movie except &quot;it was awful,&quot; and other comments designed to keep people from even looking at the movie, they hardly said anything about what bothered them about it.  I must agree that it borrows some ideas from other, similar visions of the future, but it is also highly original.<br />  This movie is very symbolic.  In Sam's dreams, you see, in symbols, how his life is affected by the government he works for.  In the office, you see the perfect working environment, where emplyees watch movies the second the boss leaves the room.  However, the best part must be the end.  I won't spoil anything for you, but what I will say is that it is quite bizzare, and there is more than one way the ending can be taken.  This movie truly shows what happens when you give the government power over everything.  Even ducts are bought (in their hundreds of colors) from the government.<br />  I thought this movie was wonderful, especially for those who like movies that make you stay up in bed the night after they watch them, just thinking about it.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I'm not a great movie fan anymore. Most of Hollywood's productions don't impress me much these days, but this movie is just fantastic! Without giving too much away, the movie is about two lesbians with a love/hate relationship. I really can't say much more without ruining the story. One helful tip: you must read David Lynch's list of clues before watching the film. It will increase your enjoyment tremendously. This is a movie that you have to unlock. The storyline doesn't present itself in a straight forward manner. There are still some aspects of the movie that I don't understand, but the list of clues helped me to get most of it.<br />It may be a good idea to watch the film more than once to get it. Its unique, I doubt there is anything like it in the world, even among Lynch's other works. Approach it knowing its not going to be what you expect. It [plays]with your mind a little, but that's what makes it so [very] great!
B00004XQ83|5.0|Let me tell you first off, being a 13 yr old girl, in the middle of the pop world, I hate country. I would beg my parents in the car to let me listen to my Pop/Rock/Rap stations, but one day my dad popped in this Cd, and now we all sing along to it on road trips, or trips to the store.<br />1)Po Lazarus... man, this 1950's was originally recorded by a prision chain gang, the song being written by James Carter. I just wish that the chopping didn't drown out the lyrics.<br />2)Big rock cany mountians.... the original adult version. This funny song is no Willy Wonka favorite.<br />3) You are my sushine... Such a sad, touching song. I love this song, with it's syncappated country sound.<br />4) Down to the river to pray... this is my favorite song to sing and listen to. I love picking out all the bacground harmonys. it is a beautiful song, with Aloson Krauss as lead vocalist.<br />5) Man of Constant Sorrow.. a catchy, great song. If you've seen the movie, how could you think of anything other than George Clooney's eyebrows?<br />6)Hard time Killing Floor Blues.. a beautiful song. Chris Thomas King's voice is so rich. Very thought-prevoking<br />7) Man of constant Sorrow.. a beautiful guitar instrumental that gets you in a mood for music appreciation.<br />8)Keep on the sunny side.. the titel says it all. A happy true-bluegrass number<br />9)I'll fly away... an old hym that is very moving, though I like the higher pitched version in the movie better. Wonder why they changed it?<br />10)Didn't leave nobody but the baby.... Ahh the sirens, the vocals are supurb, but when u really listen to the lyrics, they are quite desturbing.<br />11) In the Highway.... if u haven't seen the movie (u need to) then u will not understand why there are three little girls singing.<br />12)I am weary (let me rest).... one of my favorites, the Cox family is very talented.<br />13)Man of Constant sorrow... I love this violin instrumental. It is my favorite song. A violin player myself, i guessI appreciate it, but it's just so beautiful!!<br />14)o death.... O DEATH!!!! Ralph stanley's haunting tenor voice is perfect for this song. It upsets my mom, but I love it. It makes me thankful for life.<br />15)In the Jailhouse now... a funny, uplifting song, with a suprising yodel. you should hear my family on this part, haha.<br />16) Man of Constant sorrow... The full band id behind them this time, and I like it better than Just the gitar accompaniment (sorry tommy) (see the movie)<br />17)Indian War Whoop... don't worry, it's not what it sounds like. it portrays the village idiots... once again, WATCH THE MOVIE<br />18)Lonesome valley... while this is kinda a weird song, u have to admit, the vocal harmony is amazing.<br />19)Angel Band.... this is a beautiful song. The stanley brothers are very good. In the movie i liked it better, but it's still wonderfull. <BR>I hope u found this movie.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|First off, I was ... misled ...  The previews in no way suggested that this movie would be a musical.  Although visually pleasing, the bits and pieces of pop music scattered throughout the movie was somewhat disconcerting.  I just couldn't get used to it.  It might have been a bit better if I would have known whether most of the movie was meant to be joking or serious.  I swear, every time they burst into a remade pop song, I was waiting for a punch line only to be confused when there wasn't any.  I am assuming the \\"Like a Virgin\\" scene was a joke, and, although I now find it hilarious, the first time I saw the movie I was so confused as to whether the director was joking and trying to make the audience laugh, or if he was in earnest ...  I would have just given this movie two stars, but for one reason.  The remake or \\"Roxanne\\" was so poinient and so well done I would buy the movie just for that.
B0000640VO|4.0|A FANTASTIC movie, for all of the mentioned reasons.  However, the new DVD release does have a couple of errors in its English subtitling.  Example: When Amelie asks Nino to turn to a certain page in his book, instead of ordering him to look at Page 32 (or whichever page it was...I was using those subtitles for a reason), the subtitle says &quot;Page St.&quot;  Huh?  A similar moment happens when Amelie goes to the funhouse.  (Instead of &quot;He doesn't get off until 5:00&quot;, the subtitle says, &quot;He doesn't get in until 5:00&quot;...which totally doesn't make sense in context.)<br />Strangely, these errors weren't present in the theatrical release.
B00005YXZH|5.0|quite possibly.. an american radiohead. Wilco rocks majorly. Jeff Tweedy is a genius.
B00000JG4N|4.0|I've never been a Motley Crue fan in particular (I can't even remember how I bought this album) but Dr Feelgood is the band's tour-de-force...and is an excellent introduction to Motley Crue.<br />Although the band's image is a ruff and tuff party band, this album is in fact, extremely well-produced.  The riffs are chunky; the melodies are sweet and the playing is tight.  This is as ultimate rock as it gets.  Dr Feelgood has a drive and verve that hasn't been matched since, and deservedly sold loads of copies.  It's hard to explain why some albums hit the sweet spot more than others, but this one does with an array of tracks...&quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; is a great song, and a personal favourite of mine.  Motley Crue is perhaps somewhat underrated against their other rock peers but they transcended for a time above a crowded field.  This shows the band's songwriting and rhythmic skills at their peak.  Take it from a non-diehard crue fan.  If rock is your forte, you'll have fun with this one.
0393317552|1.0|If east-west trade routes and available plant and animal life were all there were to it, why civilization should have risen in Europe a billion years earlier!<BR>When other civilizations have accomplished something there has been no great shame in admitting it and no great cries as to why they had to have been first, given their geography and no other reason.  But if Mr. Diamond didn't feel he had to create a mythical monster racist race then his book wouldn't even have a reason to exist.  He creates both the monster and the dreaded answer to the monster - neither of which even exist except for purposes of his own secret agenda, which is the clear favoratism he shows towards non-white races.<BR>This book is a complete work of fiction by a sick and perverted mind and has no relationship to actuality.  Isn't the veiled accusations he makes in regards to the opinions of one certain race, the exact definition of racism?  No, if you want to see the opinions of racism, you need look no further than this book.<BR>He is correct that intelligence had nothing to do with the rise of the west - the best minds on earth fleeing savagery and ignorance to come live in the west is what had to do with it, not his childlike idiocy in regards to animal and plant life and trade routes.  Nor his mythical accusation of race-wide racism, said accusation based solely of course, on their hated race.
6305137293|4.0|It seems as if the only reason people bash Halloween 2 is because they want it to be Halloween, and get upset that it wasn't a re-release of the original.  Well, if you are more open-minded, and watch it, and appreciate it for what it is as its own film, you will realize that it is a good solid film with some chilling scares, and stands well on its own.  Halloween 3(no true relation to the series), 4, 5, 6, H20, and the new [movies] with busta\\"move\\"rhymes don't have nearly as much suspense, chills, creativity, and good cinamatography combined as Halloween 2.  The truth is that Halloween and Halloween 2 are the only two movies that are worth seeing in this series.  Part 4 was decent enough, but a waste of time overall.  The rest(3,5,6,h20, and resurrection) should burned and forgotten.  I could have [made] better films !!  But, 2 was good, and continues and ends the story of Halloween, and it should have stopped when the credits rolled at the end of it.  If it had, the Halloween series would have been two movies, and would have been great, but unfortanetly it went to hell and got turned into cliched slasher films by awful two-bit directors and writers.
B00005QIPH|5.0|...<BR>Now a few words on the record. Perhaps this has all been done before, perhaps The Strokes are infinitely far from being equal to The Velvet Underground. However - and I was incredibly reluctant to accept this fact - this record is remarkable, it is inspired, coherent, smart, catchy, and so strikingly sincere that to those who attempt to listen, it immediately makes all babble about trust funds or undeserved hype irrelevant. There is bubbling youth, arrogance, a walk-on-air and walk-through-wall attitude so uncompromising, it makes itself felt as one of a kind. Every single track is a swift punch that just refuses to lose its charge. Be it \\"Soma\\" or \\"Alone, Together\\", \\"Hard To Explain\\" or \\"Take It Or Leave It\\", you will not deny yourself another listen. Or two.
B000024KBZ|4.0|I guess if you have the CD there's no technical side 2. I had this release on cassette originally. &quot;Do You Believe in Shame&quot; is - in my opinion - the best track on the album. &quot;Palomino&quot; is a close second. This is quite an eclectic album for D2. If you're a fan and have never heard the entirety of &quot;Big Thing&quot;, you won't be disappointed.
B000002J1I|1.0|...simply have no ears. I understand that die hard Yes fans will do and say anything for the love of their band, and try to 'sell' Yes to others, but this is just lame. Be honest. If a person who never heard Yes before bought this album on your 5 star reviews, that person would say that Yes is a terrible band and never listen to Yes again. Buy Relayer, and if you have all the other albums, and want to buy Tormato, buy another copy of Relayer before you spend any money om Tormato.
B000007S5B|4.0|While at the time this album received mixed reviews from critics, specifically charging the Doors with going soft, it is easier to evaluate this album and its short comings 30+ years after its release.  The album was originally to be titled \\"The Celebration of the Lizard\\" but was dropped due to the band not being able to nail the extended poem in the studio.  Celebration was to be Morrison's masterpiece, and take up an entire side of the album.  It is only represented on \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" with the climax of the piece, \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\".  When the band was unable to include Celebration, panic must have ensued.  This album has fragments of greatness such as \\"Not To Touch The Earth\\",  \\"Unknown Soldier\\", \\"Spanish Caravan\\", \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\", and \\"Five To One\\", but unlike their previous 2 albums, this record contains some weak cuts as well.  \\"Yes, The River Knows\\" and \\"Wintertime Love\\", both penned by Robbie Krieger, would probably not have been included on this album if Celebration and the title cut (which appeared later on Morrison Hotel)were polished for release.  This is not a cheap shot at Robbie; after all, he also penned \\"Light My Fire\\", which can be considered one of the greatest rock songs of all time, and stepped up for this album when the band was frantic for material.  Unfortunately, Morrison sounds dead while singing these 2 tunes by Robbie, an early indication of The Soft Parade album, when Morrison disliked Robbie's tunes to the point that songwriting credits were for the first time broken between the two; that way, the people wouldn't think Morrison was behind the lyrics of \\"Touch Me\\", and \\"Tell All The People\\".<br />On their first 2 albums, the guys took us to a different realm; there were no weak cuts; they both had a distinct beginning and end, leading us the entire way through the trip.  This album gets us to the point that we want them to take control and lead us through, but it falls just short. Morrison doesn't fully show-up to guide us through heaven and hell as he had before.  Similar to a frustrating acid experience at its peak, showing  us the door to pure bliss but can't quite push us through to get us there.<BR>   <BR>Bottom line, this is not a full Doors album, it is half an album with filler.  While there are throw-away tracks, I've given it 4 stars because in comparison to their first 2 albums, it's easy to criticize, but in comparison to albums by others, it is exceptional, which is a complement to Jim, Ray, Robbie, and John.
B000002J1I|1.0|This will be a short review.<br />Tormato is bad. And I mean BAD. The songs are bad, the sound is bad, the performances are bad(Wakemans keyboard sounds like a 5$ kid-keyboard), and even the cover is bad. Circus of heaven is the worst Yes song ever released (at least so far, but there will be some songs on the coming 'in a word' from the 'Paris sessions' that's even worse.) Absolutely no wonder they broke up after this. It's a mystery that a band that came up with classics like 'soundchaser','awaken','heart of the sunrise','gates of delirium', 'close to the edge' and many more would be able to record something as horrible like this p.o.c. Even 9012-live is a better buy. 'On the silent wings of freedom' earns the one star. (And I am a great Yes fan...)
B000000132|4.0|Possibly Renaissance's very best effort. Includes Renaissance's best song &quot;Things I Don't Understand.&quot; This lesser known song has all the trademarks i.e. the heavy,heavy Richenbacher bass, Annie Haslam's voice of an angel vocals plus Jon Tout's prodigious piano playing. Jon really pounds the keys on this one! The song is written in the minor key like so many but up tempo for a refreshng change. Also included is the more well known &quot;Mother Russia.&quot; A really fine ballad but not quite as good as the live version.
B000006NPY|4.0|This album should not really be considered a Smashing Pumpkins' album.  This is more like a Billy Corgan tribute to Depeche Mode than anything else.  Every single other Smashing Pumkins album followed the grunge path to a certain extent (with little divergences into the worlds of beautiful and abstract), yet this album dives straight into the world of elctro-synth pop with guitars thrown in.  Although, this album doesn't have a Smashing Pumpkins sound to it, that isn't to say it is a bad album.  The songs are highly catchy and seemingly emotionally expressive.  The crunchy guitars and complex rock drumming that are so prominent in other Smashing Pumpkin albums have been replaced with drum machines, subdued acoustic guitars and lots of synths.  <br />Even though this is not classic Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan does show provide excellent song-writing.  The orchestrations provided by the synths are much more elaborate than those found on Gish or Siamese Dream which is both a positive aspect and a hindrance.  It is positive in the way that it does show Corgan's ability as a song-writer and a musician, a hindrance in that, at times the songs become almost too complex to actually be considered radio fan-fare (but is that too terrible of a thing??).  All in all, it seems that Corgan has embraced his old influences in the synth-pop and goth worlds and created the ultimate tribute to them.  <br />In conclusion, be forewarned when purchasing this album, you will probably enjoy this album much more if you like Depeche Mode and New Order.  If you enjoy any of the other Smashing Pumkpins' albums or are a fan of grunge and rock, you will probably have a hard time gaining a liking for Adore.

B000055Y0X|5.0|By reading the rest of the reviews posted, one should come to the conclusion that this movie is not for everyone.  The \\"humour\\" is very subdued and dark and requires a certin taste to fully appreciate.  With that being said, one should probably rent this movie first to see if they will enjoy owning it.  <br />With that out of the way, several reviews here have complained about the DVD itself.  There are two versions of this movie that has been released on DVD.  The first version was in complete full-screen (despite the box advertising it being in multi-aspect ratio), and had no special features.  The special edition (which is pictured here on Amazon) does switch ratios as the film was intended to.  The special edition also has a range of audio and subtitle options (besides the Spanish only subtitle option given on the Widescreen Edition) and is the host to a few interesting documentaries.  Also, although the transfer is much clearer than the VHS copy of the film, it still has a raw documentary quality to it, where grains appear from time to time.  <br />As for the movie itself, it is a film of great artistry.  From the sexual combining of the planes in the opening credits to Kubrick's excellent direction.  Many people will not find this film funny as in the same vein as Mel Brooke's comedies, but to see George C. Scott chew gum while talking to his mistress and arguing about the \\"Big Board\\" is quite hilarious.  Also, Dr. Strangelove's speech at the end about how to save the human race not only has comedy flair to it, but also gives a light-hearted glimpse of what went through people's minds during the cold war.  For how the film combines the aspects of artistry and entertainment into a solid collective, it should be hailed as one of the greatest movies ever made.  Although, most people usually don't like artistry AND entertainment.  There is usually too much artistry in this film for the people who are solely into films for entertainment purposes and vice versa.<br/>In conclusion, this movie is not for everyone.  For people that enjoy dark comedy, satire, and Kubrick, this film will probably quench your thirsts for entertainment, but for everyone else, it would probably be good to rent it first.
B000001ELF|5.0|I love KISS. They are my favorite band. I have to tell the truth though. Paul,Gene,and Peter's solo albums [stink] big time. Ace had a very good heavy metal record. Good songs, good playing, great effort. I wish Ace had right away put together a band when he quit KISS. This is a great hard rock record that stands alone as a good album seperate from KISS. They should not have put KISS's name on the album cover though, because with the [music] the other three members put out, they don't deserve to be tied in with this decent album. This is a great album. Also try The Joe Perry Project to see why Joe Perry was the real soul behind Aerosmith (when they were a good heavy metal band).
B0000640VO|5.0|Last year the selection committee at the Cannes Film Festival in France proclaimed that Amelie was not `serious enough' to be included in the event. This slight didn't harm the movie's performance. It became one of France's biggest hits ever and went on to become the highest grossing French film ever released in America. <br />Amelie is pure fantasy. It takes place in that fabulous Paris that exists only in the movies - the Paris of Moulin Rouge, An American in Paris and Gigi. Movies as fantasy can be tricky, though. When poorly conceived, we roll our eyes and sigh, \\"Only in the movies!\\" But when done well, as in Amelie, we smile, feel good inside, and exclaim, \\"Only in the movies!\\"<br />Amelie [Audrey Tautou] is 23 years old. She had a miserable childhood. After her mother died accidentally. her father mistakenly decided Amelie had a heart condition and treated her accordingly. She watched him become lonely and sad. Now, she works in a Paris cafe, surrounded by co-workers and customers as daffy and eccentric as she is. One day she finds a cigar box with a child's toys in it. It's been hidden away in her apartment for years. She decides to find its owner, and the happiness this act brings to a stranger causes her to make a hobby out of helping people. Sometimes, if a person deserves it, she plays tricks on them, but this is just part of her plan to help them. Her biggest challenge is to trick her father into coming out of his isolation. She also falls in love with a young man who hardly knows she exists. How she gets him is as strange and delightful as the ways in which she carries out her good works. <br />Tautou is wondrous as Amelie. Her big eyes, amazing hairdo, somewhat gawky manner, and quirky, knowing smile combine to make her character unique and charming. <br />The movie is photographed in wonderfully rich, warm tones that make Amelie's world most inviting. <br />Some critics seemed irritated by the movie, claiming that it manipulated their feelings. I didn't see it that way. We find out at the beginning that Amelie is a lonely child who finds happiness in a fantasy world. So, it's logical that she would see the good things in life as fantastical. Her actions always fit her odd view of reality. <br />The biggest drawback for some viewers is that the movie is in French. Imagine that! A French movie in French!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album is full of songs that teenagers can relate to.  In a world where pop music is all about sex, and punk music is all about jerks, Avril finds a balance and adds her own touch.  Everything is straight from the heart, and something all teens can understand. My favourite song is #1, Losing Grip.  It's about being betrayed by somebody who should have been there and wasn't.  Now come on, who *hasn't* had that happen?
1559409002|4.0|This is a cheaply made B movie that distinguishes itself for a number of reasons: 1) Some of the early scenes are very well framed and photographed and do remind you of Ingmar Bergman's films (this standard does not sustain itself for the rest of the movie, however), 2) The use of an organ score was probably an economic decision but it works well here, 3) the use of a real abandoned amusement park creates a set ideal for the story, 4) the movie moves slowly but gracefully to create atmosphere more than narrative, 5) The low brow romeo who tries to put the make on the heroine does a great character acting job that is nearly note perfect, 6) the movie lingers in your imagination long after it is over. Not a great film, but a find for those looking for the unusual, independent film that has been overlooked. I am sure this would be a very creepy film to show kids on Halloween night.
0679735259|5.0|A classmate gave me this book in 1980, when I was a 13 year old girl with a voracious reading appetite.  Strange as it may seem, girls do like war books and this one still stands out in my mind as one of the best written from a nitty-gritty, no-holds-barred point of view.  Our history classes never quite made it to an in-depth look at Vietnam even though we were born of an era that witnessed Vets coming home, injured, despondent and forever changed.  This book gave me my first understanding of what it was like to be a \\"grunt\\" in that war, which the antiseptic history books would never do.  It also gave me respect for all who were stuck in that quagmire and how war could make anyone go quite loony.  It's very compelling and hard to put down, even for a 13 year old.
0316666343|4.0|The subject matter of this book had me worried when I first heard about it. I mean it's about a girl who is raped and murdered and how she watches her family get torn apart after her death from heaven! Sounds like a weepy, depressing book no one in their right mind would want to read, right? But I gave it a shot because it had so many people talking and raving that I thought I should at least try it. The first two chapters are a bit intense but they are not too gruesome and instead are compelling and make you want to read more. And the book, while one could never exactly call it a happy read, is not altogether depressing or dreary. It makes you think. Their is something touching about the mess Susie watches her family become, even more so as the years pass. It's not a perfect book but it has a clear message and reaches your heart without cloying too hard. The language can get a little overboard but manages not to give the impression of manipulating you in the way Nicholas Sparks would. Ultimately the book is about moving on, acknowledging the past as a part of who we are but without letting it define us. It's a nice sentiment, and Sebold gets it across beautifully. She is certainly a talent to watch. If the Lovely Bones is any indication she has a great skill.
038533348X|5.0|I don't like sci-fi, but I loved this. This is the first Vonnegut I've read (I took a chance after reading so much praise for it) and it definitely won't be the last. It's one of those rare and wonderful books in the same vein as Animal Farm: simple prose, easy to read, yet with ironic tinges and thought-provoking depths; a novel that can be read and enjoyed at many different levels.<br />Cat's Cradle is narrated through Jonah, an author who aims to write a book on the single day the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. On investigating the atomic bomb's main founding father (and his three children) he is told about a *non-existant* substance with the capacity to provide all water on earth with a different molecular structure, turning it into Ice 9 (ie, a substance that could bring about the end of the world) A different assignment takes Jonah to the small island of San Lorenzo where he encounters Felix Hoenikker's three children and a society where the religion of choice (a religion that everyone knows is based on lies, yet still has utter faith in) is punishable by death, for the simple fact that it adds excitement to the dull lives of the inhabitants. I won't go any further...<br />The thing that delighted me most about this book was the way in which it was written. A lot of great and influential books are ones that (on the whole) you enjoy, but take a while to get into, and at times you feel like giving up on: you know the book in question is good literature, but the style and plot make finishing it seem a chore.<BR>Similarly, a lot of fast-paced books hold little impact, don't challenge the mind and are forgotten the instant you read them.<BR>Kurt Vonnegut has managed to write a powerful and memorable novel in a short, snappy style: this book has everything that makes a compelling, challenging read. Vonnegut lets you get a feel for the characters without going into lengthy descriptions, he manages to make sharp, subtle criticisms of religion, human nature andsociety without rambling or whining, his plot is exciting yet not unrealistic, he creates a hellish world that plays on everyone's fear of obliteration in precious few words. I thought the ending was too abrupt, but it fitted well with the rest of the story (and it would have been even more disappointing if he'd created a satisfying, everything-tied-up-nicely ending)<br />I found this impossible to put down, and highly recommend it to any fan of literature.
B0000009S3|5.0|This is one of Zappa's best offerings.  Peaches en Regalia is on of the best instrumental rock/jazz pieces ever produced.  Hot Rats, with Captain Beefheart's vocals, is an edgy piece with masterful musicianship and wonderful lyrics.  This is a must have for any Zappa fan.
B000060P79|5.0|Like my title says this c.d rox. The songs are funny and you can relate to them. I just love the music and the lyrics. So if you like punk music you should definatly get this c.d If you like it they will be at warped tour...
B000066F6H|5.0|Why is it The Hives and the White Stripes cannot be mentioned without a reference to The Strokes.  I have seen the White Stripes Live, and have all of the discs put out by all three bands, and I cannot fathom why anyone would mention the Strokes in the same breath as the Hives.  The Hives are a high energy punk/garage rock hybrid without peer among current bands.  Veni Vidi Vicious is easily a top three album of the year.  For my money, its best offering is &quot;The Hives - Introduce the Metric System in Time&quot;.  It is a blistering, energetic song with exemplary musicianship displayed by the band.  Veni Vidi Vicious is a strong, energetic and fast paced disc from beginning to end.  I recommend all Hives releases to date.  AVOID THE STROKES.
0312265859|3.0|Let me state I love this series of books and own all of them. So I'm predisposed with positive feeling before I start reading.<br />However, this book felt like a formula book for the 1st time in this series.<br />* Re-run psycho guy after Stephanie (villian retread was disappointing).<br />* Where were the two guys vying for Stephanie? They had minor bits of support or saving, seemed uninterested in Stephanie, and especially uninterested they were both elements in her life. Where was the tension, the big build up, when she finally hooked up?<br />* The lawyer guy was not as amusing as Grandma or Lulu, why was he hanging out with Stephanie?<br />I hope this series isn't running out of steam. Stephanie seems backed into a corner romance-wise: can't have a relationship with Joe without ditching her job, can't have a relationship with Ranger because you don't have relationships with him.<br />Support characters I have grown to love were not developed further.<br />I hope book nine reverses this dip in the series.
0684833395|4.0|Heller classic is very well written, it contains wittiness, funny situations, and other life threating ones. Written at the time of world war two and lived in Europe.<br />The book is not always easy to follow, since it jumps from one thing to another, but that what makes it even better, and more interesting to continue reading.<br />Yossarian, the main character is just something else. He tries in everyway to get out of the war, he spends a lot of time in the hospital pretending to be ill, he even pretends to be the son of another family who has been greatly injuired in the war...<br />A classic to be read...
B000002J2B|4.0|&quot;Wind And Wuthering&quot; is a difficult album to judge, for I have<BR>always wanted to like it more than I actually do.  The gorgeous gray cover, with its lone tree, certainly evokes the kind of romantic, ghostly spiritual presence that has always been attributed to the album by its fans.  And some of the tracks do live up to the hype--but I can't help but feel that Hackett is being criminally underused here.  He once stated that a lot of the album felt like Genesis retread, and with the first two tracks, &quot;Eleventh Earl Of Mar&quot; and &quot;One For The Vine&quot;, this is largely true.  Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing, <BR>as Tony's keyboards and Hackett's guitar never sounded better than they do in the ethereal opening moments of &quot;Eleventh Earl&quot;; however, while both lengthy tracks go through interesting sections (the quiet acoustic portion of &quot;Earl&quot;; the surprising<BR>keyboard/percussion interlude in &quot;One For The Vine&quot;), neither composition manages to hold together all of its parts as one unified, memorable piece. &quot;Vine&quot; in particular meanders from one section to the next, though in retrospect it is one of their last prog epics. &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;, which follows, is a frailly searching love song that foreshadows what was to come<BR>in Collin's future, but is overlong and slightly sappy (a problem which would worsen, of course, later--although <BR>a better version of this song with strings would show up on the<BR>Genesis Archives Vol.2 set).  Finally, &quot;Wot Gorilla is a mildly arresting slice of fusion that, nonetheless, sounds like a repeat<BR>of &quot;Los Endos&quot; from the previous album.<br />Side two begins no better, with the slight lyric &quot;All In A Mouse's Night&quot; (in which the fluffy fantasy elements in Genesis reach the point of caricature--one can see Collins move from this to Disney films in no time), but then dramatically improves with Hackett's brilliant &quot;Blood On The Rooftops&quot;, which is both lyrically and musically emotional, strong and slightly cynical. Beginning with an exquisite nylon guitar, Phil then moves into a line about disinterested TV viewing before the mellotron<BR>takes the song to another level--*this* is the Genesis I know and love.  The pace continues with the atmospheric opening to <BR>&quot;Unquiet Slumbers&quot;, which soon turns into the fusion-y instrumental &quot;In That Quiet Earth&quot;, with great, focused playing by all members before settling down into &quot;Afterglow&quot;, the perfect closing song and the one epic love ballad Phil Collins was meant to sing (too bad about the 200 after that, though...).<BR>These last three tracks--&quot;Rooftops&quot;, &quot;In That Quiet Earth&quot; and &quot;Afterglow&quot;--make such a satisfying closer to the album that I almost forgive the meandering prog retread and silly lyrics that came before (none of which is *that* bad, btw).  It's only knowing what Hackett knew--that his great piece &quot;Please Don't Touch&quot; was rejected, and another incredible outtake &quot;Inside And Out&quot; (which features his playing) was relegated to EP status<BR>that makes &quot;Wind And Wuthering&quot; a frustrating listen.  If &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; had been shortened to a reasonable length (it was a pop song, after all), &quot;Wot Gorilla&quot; been replaced by &quot;Please Don't Touch&quot; and &quot;All In A Mouse's Night&quot; replaced at the beginning of side two by &quot;Inside And Out&quot;, I think the album would have been much stronger.  I can take &quot;One For The Vine&quot;, although I think more energy and focus needed to be put into its creation; it is a classic example of a prog track that places<BR>too much emphasis on arrangement, playing and compositional<BR>complexity at the expense of energy and accessibility--an unusual<BR>complaint for a band like Genesis, who usually avoided just<BR>those usual excesses.  I believe this was because Hackett was not as involved this time around, which led to his departure, and since his compositions would be more prominent in my revised &quot;Wind&quot; I tend to take his side of the situation.  Certainly, Genesis almost instantly went into sappy pop mode the minute he left, which makes &quot;Wind&quot; the last album of quality studio work from the band.
630439845X|5.0|The story opens in the mid-19th century, as we meet the voluntarily-mute Ada McGrath (Holly Hunter) whose only form of expression is playing her beloved piano.  She and her daughter and the piano arrive in New Zealand to meet a man she's been married to in absentia, a shy farmer trying to carve a homestead out of the Maori rain forest.  Sadly, Ada has no interest in him, but she is strangely attracted to their rather earthy neighbor (Harvey Keitel).<br /><br />Wow.  This story captures sensuality, desire, and love in a very adult movie.  Hunter won Best Actress of 1994 for her performance as  the drab and somber Ada and eleven year-old Anna Paquin won Best Supporting Actress for playing her spunky daughter.  Neill is appropriately stiff and unsure (and altogether adorable) as the unhappy husband, but the real surprise here is Harvey Keitel, who is unforgettably lusty.<br /><br />This is an unusual and erotic tale with unlikely lovers finding each other in an inhospitable place.  Memorable.
B00001ZULV|3.0|...it's this one.  These are the songs Genesis are most<BR>(in)famous for: breezy, synth-laden electro-pop topped by<BR>Collins' ubiquitous vocal style.  Only &quot;Mama&quot; has any bite<BR>to it, and it is edited here.  Naturally, the band had so many hits between 1978-1992 that there wasn't enough space on the 78-minute disc to include &quot;No Reply At All&quot;, &quot;Paperlate&quot; or &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, but all the biggest ones are here.  Of course, the problem is that by the time the group had changed their style to that of hit-making pop machine around 1978 or so, they ditched the creative prog-rock sound that had made them so special in the early days (as Armando Gallo was wont to say, they lost a lot of magic when Gabriel left, and a lot of romanticism when Hackett left).  Thus, the only representations of that era are the atypical &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;, their first attempt at a catchy pop hit in '73 (but one that, with its clever lyric and unusual arrangement, still manages to outclass the other songs surrounding it here!), and a 1999 remake of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; that unites all five core members again, but<BR>does not sound at all like a group effort (in fact, each member seperately overdubbed his contribution--a more robotic process<BR>I could not imagine).  The real treats Genesis have given us recently have been their two Archive releases, which cover both prog and pop eras with awider scope and better songs.  However,<BR>for those of you for whom &quot;That's All&quot;, &quot;Misunderstanding&quot; and<BR>&quot;In Too Deep&quot; remain guilty pleasures, this one is sure to be a must buy.  I got it myself, just to see what the group's hits sound like when placed back-to-back.
6301607929|5.0|This intense drama unfolds over one Labor Day weekend in a sleepy Oklahoma town. Aging loser William Holden shows up to beg former pal Cliff Robertson for a job, and ends up proposing to Robertson's girlfriend (Novak)and hopping a freight out of town.  Spunky old maid school teacher Rosalind Russel is pure dynamite here.<br />Kim Novak is just right as the unsatisfied young woman who wants to be needed, not just gawked at.  She finds what she's looking for in the arms of the swaggering, jobless Holden.  Their electrifying dance at the picnic is worth the price of the video.  When Kim pulls away from her mother grasp in the last moments, you ache for both  mother and daughter, knowing what troubles inevidibly lie ahead.<br />My favorite character is the kindly old neighbor lady, Mrs. Potts, played by Verna Felton. She observes the dramatic events in her neighbors' lives and shares her experience, wisdom, and hugs with everyone. She is the one stable force in the little group.  Felton's performance always brings a tear to my eye.
B000001H00|5.0|the performance of the Chaconne on this set is completely stunning (as is the rest, but that piece is one of the pinnacles of Bach).  the playing is very objective and sounds a bit cold at first, but this impression fades fast with repeated listening, and is replaced by the impression that the recording is a monument of human spirituality.  pretty soon, all you will want to listen to, is this recording, and maybe also fournier's cello suites.
B0000025AI|5.0|Johnny Winter recorded this during his stint as producer and sideman for Muddy Waters through the  four brilliant albums recorded for Blue Sky (late 70's and early 80's). Muddy's terrific band of the time accompanies Johnny throughout. Their influence is profound, keeping Winter grounded and unusually restrained avoiding overplaying entirely. This is his finest blues work. Muddy sings a duet with Johnny in an energetic version of Walkin' Through the Park. A classic along with the previously mentioned four Muddy Blue Sky recordings. Highly recommended...Simon
0316666343|2.0|When I began The Lovely Bones, I'd just finished reading Lucky,which I think is one of the most gripping,insightful,and humorous memoirs I've ever read -- so, I couldn't wait to read Sebold's first novel.<br />Then, to read what seemed like idle reveries of a suburban everygirl or everyboy or everydaughter or everyhousewife or everyhusband,depending on the character in Lovely Bones,well,to say I was disappointed is an everystatement.<br />Lucky was so taut. Its prose, its plot, its magnificent dark humor, about a distinctly unhumorous crime against Sebold,kept the reader riveted. By contrast, The Lovely Bones, with its limp style and indifferent characterization made me struggle to maintain my concentration or to care about these characters.<br />I do think that Sebold's gritty and brilliant writing in Lucky could be repeated in another book. Alas, I didn't find it in The Lovely Bones.
2070102645|5.0|A story of mans struggle with himself, and an oppressive society. The book has it all repression, discrimination, Love. The persuit of Val jean by the relentless Javert. I have read the book many times over, and still get the same joy from reading it. Do not be put of by the size, it is an eminately readable book.

It really helps if you follow it up with the millionaire mind. For more information see my other reviews
B000065U1N|4.0|Ridley Scott followed his great success in \\"Gladiator\\" with this gripping war film about a \\"small-scale\\" US military and humanitarian mission which went horribly wrong. In 1993 the East African nation of Somalia was falling apart - a drought had caused a massive famine, and the situation was made worse by the fact that there was no \\"national\\", or central government in Somalia. Instead, the nation was divided up among various warlords, most of whom were little more than bloodthirsty thugs who employed \\"militias\\" (little more than heavily-armed street gangs) to terrorize the population. The Red Cross tried to send food to the starving populace, but it was intercepted by the warlords, who doled out the food to increase their power. A force of US Army Rangers and Delta Force was sent to Somalia to \\"keep the peace\\" and ensure that the food reached the Somalian people. In a raid to seize the most powerful warlord - a raid which wasn't supposed to take over an hour - the US troops were pinned down by thousands of \\"militia\\" in a brutal street fight which went on for hours. As in \\"Gladiator\\", Ridley Scott gives a realistic view of battle - and as a result it's sometimes difficult to tell what is going on, as the battle scenes are often confused, with lots of screaming and running and the camera jerking awkwardly as you follow the soldiers. But that only adds to the realism, as (like the American soldiers), you never know who or what might be around the next street corner. ... I thought that \\"Black Hawk Down\\" simply showed America's soldiers in a VERY realistic light - they were simply trying to rescue their wounded, save themselves and their fellow soldiers, and get out of a nasty situation. I never saw a soldier \\"wave the flag\\", and given the way the warlords were treating their own people, they were hardly \\"victims\\" of American aggression in any sense of the word! ... Again, I thought Ridley Scott was simply trying to give moviegoers the \\"feel\\" of what it was like to be inthe streets of Somalia's capital city during the fight. If you've got a strong stomach and wish to see a realistic film that will give you a much greater appreciation of America's \\"fighting men\\", then \\"Black Hawk Down\\" will not be a disappointment!
B000001ESF|5.0|With over 20 minutes of rock hard musical bliss taking up the entire first side of the album, you can't find much to complain about with this one....except possibly, that it is too short!<BR>The best epic type song Rush has done, in my opinion, and the other (shorter) tracks such as &quot;Tears&quot; and &quot;Lessons&quot; are stands outs as well. From the poignancy and poetics of &quot;Tears&quot; to the rocking rhythms of &quot;Something for Nothing&quot;, this album is Great lyrically, as well as musically, and was perhaps, the very first time Rush stepped completely outside it's bounderies and showed us what they were really all about.
B000000WG3|2.0|Not really a blues album.  All his others are really blues and I like them much better
B000002IWQ|5.0|Well.<BR>I can't say enough good things about the Rockability of this one. Great guitar techniques throughout...you can tell Alex was really practicing before this one...as for the lyrics, they take on a new path...while not neccesarily Neil's best (His best, most insightful occurs in the range of 1980-1991) it's still a great effort on his part. \\"Animate\\" is one of the best openers Rush offers. The only few songs I didn't enjoy enough to say, give a 10/10 scorings to would have to be \\"Stick It Out\\" for it's sheer repetitivness...(though the guitar is great, I will admit), \\"Between Sun and Moon\\"--because it was quite 60s ish...and \\"Everyday Glory\\". Overall though, the rest of this album proves to be a great Rush....the lyrics can overcome you but the music is Classic. The solo in \\"Cut to the Chase\\" rivals the more well-known classics like \\"La Villa\\" or even \\"Limelight\\" and \\"nobody's hero\\" is poignant, sad, artistic, and lonely...a call for us all to stop and think about what \\"Everybody's buying...\\"and \\"Alien Shore\\" is a chalk-full of great riffs, drum fills, and rhythm complexity. \\"Speed of Love\\" is a romantic expression, backed by great music to rock to--a real turn on! And \\"Cold Fire\\" is quite possibly one of thier all-around BEST songs!! \\"Leave that Thing Alone!\\" Proves to be my favorite instramental....while I agree with most that say that \\"La Villa\\" exhibits Alex's talent the most, I just like the groove of \\"Leave that Thing Alone!\\" and the drums that build on up the Alex's final moments on the glory-guitar string....that gives me chills too!! Extra points for that boys!
B00005JL3A|2.0|With the great cast and a cool plot, this could have been a pretty good movie.  However, it just takes all the usual scare tactics to new lows (disappearing bodies, constant gore including a very graphic scene involving lazers, etc.).  There is about one cool scene in the whole thing, not including the beginning and end shots of a very exposed Milla Jovovich.  Well, there's always that upcoming sequel...
B000002IOW|5.0|For True Rush fans---we KNOW that this album rocks....<BR>Before I mention the impacting lyrics, i'd like to first mention that this album tends to get bashed a lot. I suppose it has to do with what Geddy coined as the &quot;inherent weirdness&quot; of their music that is bound to tick some people off. But I must state that &quot;Presto&quot;, having incorporated synths, tetured layers of REALLY Cool drums (I'm talking about &quot;Scars&quot; here people!!), thought-provoking lyrics, creativeness, and otherwise musical genius.....how can one say this album isn't one of their best--easily included in their top five??<BR>If I had to make a list of Rush's top 5 records Presto would be there, so would Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Roll the Bones, and possibly the new one, &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;....<BR>With Presto, your getting a true spin-off from the largely synth dominated &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;.<BR>While the keyboards thing worked for them with HYF, with &quot;Presto&quot; you get a new kind of treat....The sheer imagery from &quot;Presto&quot; (The title track), to the haunting beauty of &quot;The Pass&quot;, and onward to the political issues of &quot;Red Tide&quot;, the midnight romantics of &quot;Available Light&quot;....every one of this album's songs has something great about it. Just to prove my point I'll go ahead and tell you what is great about the other tracks on here--&quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; just rocks, while &quot;Chain Lightening&quot; gives you powerful effects as well as insights into the human psyche--via Neil's mind, &quot;War Paint&quot; paints a vivid picture of young illusion....&quot;Anagram&quot; may be one of this album's weaker tracks but the anagramical phrases will show you how creative Neil can be--every other sentence coincides to something that actually makes sense! &quot;Hand Over Fist&quot; is another rock-ballad exploring the complexities of human relationships...all in all, this album is one of Rush's finest projects!!
B00004R99L|5.0|I've constantly loved this movie since I was about 4, and now, at 17, I still love it.  It's one of those kind of movies that you sort of don't get until you're older.  I never grow weary of the wierd glasses-birds, and the flamongo-croquett game in the end.  I used to like it because it was colorful and otherworldly, and now it's all that as well as VERY trippy...

B00005TT77|4.0|Hey, covering the Beatles is always a risky game, especially with as large and eclectic an effort as this one. But on this album there are at least two diamonds, from Sheryl Crowe and Sarah McLachlin, that alone are EASILY worth the price of admission. Sarah's Blackbird and Sheryl's Mother Nature's Son are faithful tributes comfortably familiar to hard-core Beatles fans, but which are also powerful renderings by two accomplished artists who effortlessly and delicately weave their own interpretations into these new versions. There are creditable renditions too, of Lucy in the Sky, I'm Looking Through You, Strawberry Fields Forever, Two Of Us, and Across The Universe. The latter though was soaringly surpassed by Fiona Apple's cover on the Pleasantville soundtrack - the I Am Sam producers missed a unique opportunity to use her version here.

Actually my FAV band of ALL time are The Smiths but I could never mix and match their albums.

B00006690G|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying this was one hell of an impulse buy for me. When I went to buy G-Sides, this Eminem CD was on display right out front, on sale, and came with a free DVD. Being the mindless consumer I am, I bought it.<br />I listened to the whole thing track by track, and I believe this is the best thing he has put out yet. He's finally off the subject of raping women and killing gays, which makes for a much more meaningful CD. Although I hate with a passion \\"Without Me\\", do not judge this CD by it. There are a lot of other tracks that look into his personal life, and many that are appealing even to a die-hard alternative fan like myself.<br />\\"Sing for the Moment\\" is my favorite track, a song which samples \\"Dream On\\" by Aerosmith. I also like \\"Superman\\", \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" (most likely the next single), and \\"Drips\\"...i was surprised by how good this CD is, and I highly recommend it.
0312979479|5.0|This is the best book written by Christie. Others of her's are good, but this is the best.<br />  Ten strangers are invited to Indian Island by a mysterious host. When they get there they are accused of murder. A doctor accused of being drunk and operating. A governess watching a child die, etc. By when suddenly one of them die, and others, and each of their death's being described in a poem before hand, things start to heat up.<br /> I loved this book, and I think you would too.
B000002UW1|5.0|I'd heard \\"It's the End of the World...\\", I knew the words to \\"The One I love\\", I knew a blues great was paid at least titular homage (\\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\"). When I bought the album last month, it was still done blindly. <br />I love REM. I've been humming the tunes and singing the words of songs like \\"Pilgrimage\\" and \\"Hairshirt\\" since I first heard them. REM simply cannot make bad music. They can, however, make comparatively weak music, as owners of \\"Monster\\" and \\"Reveal\\" can attest. Perhaps I shouldn't say I stumbled on the album blindly; \\"shortsighted\\" would be a better term. I knew what I know: This band has rarely made filler. But, would I be as pleased with this one as I was with \\"Reckoning\\" or \\"Automatic for the People\\"?<br />The difference between an answer of yes and an answer of no is this: If I said \\"yes\\", I'd be implicating that this album is as moving, innovative and altogether extraordinary as the aforementioned albums. If I answered \\"no\\", I'd be branded a heretic and hypocrite for contradicting myself. If this band can't do wrong, why this little miscalculation? The answer to the now somewhat buried question: Yes.<br />The reasons are two parts sonic, one part historical. I stated in my review of \\"Life's Rich Pageant\\" that that album was their first Big Rock offering. \\"Document\\" furthered the trend of burlier music than REM once made. Again, like \\"Pageant\\", the lyrics are freighted with allusions to the politics of the day. Unlike \\"Pageant\\", which was brilliant but incongruous, the \\"primer\\" I called it, \\"Document\\" is about as confident a stab at hard rock as can be made by a band that made the Underground swoon with peppy jangle pop numbers. And the political leanings in Michael Stipe's lyrics are carried over by a voice that, perhaps by the maturity of one more year, sound more assured of what it says. <br />\\"Finest Worksong\\", the third and least well known of three singles, opens like a train wreck: Peter Buck's guitar is like a cloud of shrapnel supporting Stipe's topical, almost apocalyptic lyrics (The time to rise has been engaged/You're better best to rearrange). Mike Mill's bass is flexible but stong and buoyant, and Bill Berry proved himself one of college rocks best drummers with his simple but undeviating technique. \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" continues in a bleak lyrical vein and propulsive music, but the highlight of the first half of the album is \\"Exhuming McCarthy\\". The song cites the Communist-mad Senator Joseph McCarthy of the fifties, whose Carnival traducement of his innocent colleagues earned him expulsion from the Senate. The song sounds like a perfect summation of the Reagan Years: The decade when the evil of Communism was leashed and put down by the evil of a man who augmented the national debt by more than twice its former amount and launched two campaigns against the country he represented. Those campaigns were his consecutive, mistake-and-hypocrisy prone tenures of office.<br />The two hits are placed back to back. \\"It's the End of the World...\\" is an upbeat nonsense number, now a radio standard. \\"The One I love\\" was their breakthrough. People paid no attention to the lyrics, it seems. Other winners: \\"Lightnin' Hopkins\\" with its complex beat and energy, and \\"Disturbance at the Heron House\\", a slower, softer, but no less grim song.<br />This historical business: AMG talks about REM puting guitar rock<BR>back in the underground lexicon. I don't know about that, but the band did make an impression. Among the founding fathers of alternative rock, REM gave post punk six years of melodious and therefore unique music. By 1986, Black Flag was defunct, Husker Du were Husker Du, the Pixies were unthought of, and Pylon didn't, and never did, earn the following they deserved. REM might have followed that pattern. They might have broken up or tried to follow the template of their fellow alterna-rock legends the Du. But, deciding that discordant genius was well-represented, they, along with the Smiths,Miracle Legion, Rain Parade and others, gave cult status a fresh angle with clean, ringing, wholesome but still iconoclastic folk-rock. \\"Document\\", therefore, is about as experimental as REM was likely to become by 1987. It was not their best work, but, next to their country-folkish music on \\"Reckoning\\", it was their most original, their boldest stylistic aberration. They kept evolving, through the years of arena rock, Guns 'n Roses, the sellout stories of U2 and Metallica. They persevered, always experimenting, never letting the dough go stale. \\"Document\\" isn't their best work. It was their breakthrough. And after seven years of constructive struggle, they deserved as much.

B000002B7M|3.0|As great as Ozzy's first album is, be aware that due to an ongoing lawsuit between Ozzy's original rhythm section Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley on one side, and Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne on the other, the bass and drum tracks on \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman\\" have been re-recorded by Ozzy's current rhythm section.  Caveat emptor.
0380789019|5.0|I loved this book, as well as every other book Neil Gaiman has conceived of, from Sandman to Dream Hunters, to American Gods. But Neverwhere was also mad into a six-part BBC miniseries once upon a time. Anyone know if it's still around, or how to get ahold of it?
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Blade 2 was a better movie than the more popular Spiderman.<BR>If you judge the movies by action, thrills and fun entertainment, Blade 2 delivers that more than Spiderman.<BR>When it comes to action Blade 2 is loaded with it from start to finish...<BR>Head to head Blade 2 gives you more bang for the buck.<BR>Spiderman lacked the great action fighting scenes that Blade 2 delivers...<BR>Even though Spiderman has records at the box office, just remember there is another movie out there not as popular, but frame for frame Blade 2 is actually better.<BR>Blade 2 is for the true action movie fans that enjoys gore and kick [bottom] fighting scenes.<BR>Get the Blade 2 double DVD when it comes out, you won't be sorry.

B0000013G9|5.0|A title to the album that as well describes each and every song on this 16 Track 10-million copy selling (Certified Diamond)album. Each song has it's own tone and touch, the songs that really got my atttention were Red Light Special, Diggin' On U, Waterfalls, and Creep, but that doesn't mean that the rest of the 12 tracks are not as catchy as these 4 are. The unfortunate death of Lisa Left Eye Lopes shocked all the dedicated TLC fans, News was reported that the remaining members will finish up the remaining work on there 4th LP. I highly recommend this album more then \\"Fanmail\\" and \\"OOOOOOhh On The TLC Tip\\" no other trio of black female artists have come lose to  the success of these three talented women. Other prodigies that would be considered the most similiar: 3LW, Destiny's Child, Blaque, 702, although none of these artists have become as quite as successful as TLC themselves except for a maybe acception for destiny's child. Buy this album, every track is great and for about [$$] for a 16 track album is not that bad.<BR>1.Intro-lude<BR>2.Creep (5)<BR>3.Kick your Game (4)<BR>4.Diggin'On You (5)<BR>5.Case Of The Fake People (4.5)<BR>6.Crazy,Sexy,Cool Inter-lude<BR>7.Red Light Special (5)<BR>8.Waterfalls (5)<BR>9.Intermission-lude<BR>10.Let's Do It Again (4)<BR>11.If I Was Your Girlfriend (3.5)<BR>12.Sexy Inter-lude<BR>13.Take Our Time (4)<BR>14.Can I Get A Witness Inter-lude<BR>15.Switch (5)<BR>16.Sumthin'Wicked Comes This Way (5)
B000002KGT|3.0|The music is great.  The recording is not.  It's a good album to listen to on the boom box.  If you have an above avarage system because your an audiophile, you won't be playing this more than once on the &quot;big&quot; system.
B00004W221|4.0|First I must say that I'm not a big sport movie fan- but I still<br />loved this movie.  The true story of a tough little guy who did not give up his dream to play football for Notre Dame will make you make you cheer at the end.
B000007NYS|4.0|Lucinda has a good album here.  The flavor is definetly more toward country than folk but she does a great job staying away from the pick up truck blues, if you know what I mean.  The recording is a little shallow, but must people wouldn't notice.
6304383177|4.0|'Strong Woman' actress Katherine Hepburn may not be associated with the type of role she plays in this film. She plays the ditsy blonde so well it's surprising she wasn't cast in more of these parts, but perhaps it's testament to her acting ability that she managed to be so versatile. Cary Grant is on form as a staid scientist engaged to marry his rather boring research assistant. Katherine Hepburn turns up, all hell breaks loose, and of course Grant ends up falling for Katherine and being ditched by his fianc&eacute;e. The 'Baby' of the title is a baby leopard and all the animal scenes are handled skilfully and seamlessly by director Howard Hawks. This is a textbook example of how to make charming 1930s comedies and good fun to boot!
B000067CPX|3.0|I discovered this CD by accident, and was pleasantly surprised. I consider myself a fair weather RHCP fan (Blood sugar sex magic and Californication) but was impressed by the \\"new\\" sound that RHCP have adopted. Flea has started to play along with the band, rather than carry them along; the \\"funk\\" feel is muted somewhat, which makes it much more listenable; the lyrics, as usual, make little sense,but the \\"rap\\" cadence that is Anthony's trademark, seems a little toned down.<br />But, after listening to it on a fairly regular basis, the songs themselves don't hold up very well. In fact, the \\"pop\\" sound gets a little old, and you start to wonder if there's any substance to the songs, or is it just bubble gum.<br />Probably not the best RHCP album ever, but not bad over all, and certainly worth a listen.
B000068TP0|5.0|To appreciate all that Shakira is, you MUST see this concert.  Having missed it when it aired on television, I only had the live cd to listen to; the DVD is 10 times better.  Not only is it in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, but there is also an option for english subtitles (for people like myself with a very limited Spanish vocabulary) as well as a behind the scenes featurette.  The clarity of the sound in dolby digital makes it seem like you're really at the concert.  And then, theres the performance.  Shakira makes singing look so easy.  You can tell that she is a master of her art (even though this concert is 3 years old) and knows how to captivate an audience.  My personal favorites are the reworked &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot;, &quot;Inevitable&quot;, and &quot;Tu&quot;, which is the greatest song a person can sing to another human being.  Get this cd, turn the lights off, light a candle, and prepare to be amazed.
B00004U8P3|4.0|Very good movie and though I usually don't care all that much for scary movies I though that Jurassic Park could have been scarier with a lot more scary scenes with the dinosaurs. Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern were great and I thought the girl who played the granddaughter of the owner of the park was good too, I'm not sure what her name is but I think it's Ariana Richards.
1857993284|4.0|I was always interested in philosophy, but I was not so sure about its history n evolution. <BR>This book not alone tells us just that but it it also has its sub-plots. It not only makes us aware of the whys n wherefores but also makes sure that we start thinking about it in our day to day lives. <BR>It is a must read for every person, not just teens for whom it was written. <br />Enjoy Sophies world and lets make it our world!!
B00005LO5P|3.0|Despite it's flaws Logan's Run is enjoyable and I think Michael York Richard Jordan and Jenny Agutter were great, Farrah Fawcett seemed a little stiff but as this was probably one of her first movies that is understandible as she has proven in other movies like The Burning Bed how good she can be and even with it's flaws I still think Logan's Run is a good movie that was worth watching.
B0000640VO|5.0|While the characters of Ally McBeal from the television show and Amelie are different and certainly Calista Flockhart & Audrey Tautou are worlds apart, one thing that appealed to me about the tv show also appeals to me about this film.  The expressionistic element is wonderful in Amelie.  Just like we used to see arrows actually flying at McBeal's heart when she was suffering a romantic heartbreak, we see Amelie literally melt into water in this film.  These are great touches.<br />Jeunet carefully planned the film, using storyboards to plan down to the minute details of exact camera angles and film speeds.  The added commentary on the DVD is an eye opener as it is described how the digital imaging now allows for the filmmaker to tint the colors and control the look of the film.  Amelie represents a great technological achievement.<br />The story is touching and carried me along to the end as if the movie passed in an instant.  Just as Jeunet paid great attention to the look of the film, he has cast and shot the supporting characters with detailed attention.  Even Jean Darie who walks across the screen for about a minute as a blind man Amelie whisks through the city describing the city scene is memorable, without uttering a line.  Serge Merlin who played Drefayel the artist with the breakable bones who paints the same Renoir painting each year for the last 2 decades is marvelous and propels Amelie to go for the gusto, so to speak.  Isabelle Nauty as Georgette the tobacconist that Amelie falls in love is wonderfully dense and neurotic.<br />The themes of the picture are also playfully and entertainingly represented.  The innocence of Amelie and Nico is a touchstone for the picture.  This is contrasted by the world around them:  Nico works in a porn shop where Amelie bravely walks in to find him.  And while Amelie does try to make those around her happy, she also metes out justice as she sneaks into the apartment of the cranky grocer and puts foot cream where his tooth paste should be and shorts out an electrical cord sending sparks.<br />Finally, I enjoyed the romance of this picture.  Mathieu Kassovitz is wonderful as the Nino.  The final scene where Amelie wordlessly and tenderly kisses his eyes and neck with him returning the caress so gently was quite beautiful, and reflects the sweetness and innocence at the heart of the film.  I found the picture a complete joy and look forward to revisiting it again.  Bonjour!h paste should be and shorts out an electrical cord sending sparks.  <br />Finally, I enjoyed the romance of this picture.  Mathieu Kassovitz is wonderful as the Nino.

0792839129|3.0|I liked this movie when I was little and would watch it when I could but one day when I was at my friend's house playing I told her and our other friends that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was on TV and I was going home to watch it and they made fun of me and called me a baby etc, but I didn't care because I liked the movie and liked the songs etc, and I thought Dick Van Dyke was awesome and I liked the kids who played his son and daughter and the actress who played his girlfriend was good too. There is a soundtrack too, I rented it a few times from the library and enjoyed listening to the cute songs.
0930289234|5.0|This graphic novel is a classic.  While someone to comics may find it difficult to understand read, no true comic enthusiast should go without reading this masterpiece.
B00001QGIQ|4.0|It's not my # 1 favorite Disney flick but Pinocchio is good. I have watched this with some of my younger relatives and the little ones seemed to get a little bored and fidgety after awhile but the older ones seemed to like Pinocchio more, anyway I think it's probably an essential for the collection of Disney videos.
B000059TPN|4.0|This is probably my favorite action movie of all time and it deserves it's title.  Waiting for the Criterion collection of this DVD and paying the extra money was worth it.  The extras range from standard to never before seen.  In particular the history of Alcatraz, behind the scenes work and commentary audio track of the film is really interesting to listen to.  The 5.1 DD sounds great and helps highlight Zimmer's first rate score (my favorite actually)  One of those rare movies where you can forgive the cheesy lines and insane plot twists so you can sit back and have fun.  A MUST HAVE addition to your collection.
B000066C6Z|4.0|Definitely a great DVD to own... I've been waiting forever to have this hilarious movie in my DVD collection.<br />The downside is the commentary. For one thing, it's extremely spotty. (i.e. three-minute gaps between comments.) For another, starting about halfway through the film, the directors begin to badmouth it relentlessly. I mean, I bought your freakin' DVD! Couldn't you at least say some nice things? Among their comments are: &quot;Do we have to watch the rest of this?&quot; and &quot;I think you could make a really solid 25 minute movie out of this material.&quot; It's awful, frustrating commentary. <br />That said, I've loved the movie for a long time. Audio is great, transfer is nice.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I expected a lot, but was very disappointed in this overrated movie!  It was much too long, and very boring.
B000002MUN|5.0|Although The Heartbreakers make appearances throughout, Wildflowers is technically a solo project and Petty definitely makes the most of his independence. There is a gentler vibe on this CD; it lacks the hard edge found on his work with the band. Songs like the title track, \\"Hard on Me,\\" and the haunting \\"Don't Fade on Me\\" have a quiet, but stirring force that shows a side of Petty seen rarely on his other work. Influences like The Beatles, The Byrds, and even Creedence (\\"Cabin Down Below\\") are showcased to good effect throughout the CD. There is a lot of great imagery on the CD; it is perhaps Petty's most personal work and one of his best.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Filled with high energy and with descriptive lyrics, Incubus' third album &quot;Morning View&quot; comes out to be a joyful and uplifting scene. With acoustic tones and with a slow style of Nirvana, you get &quot;Mexico&quot;. In &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; has very nice twangy guitar tone that'll give you a nice exotic feeling towards the album. &quot;11 am&quot; a detailed with a depressive mood but beautifully played. An unexpective song would have to be &quot;Are You In&quot; a nice song that gives the album and nice jazzy twist. Besides the slow acoustics tones and depressive lyrics, the album also comes with the normal accressive thrashers like &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;, and &quot;Have you Ever&quot;. Without rap or screaming vocals found in most bands, it's nice to find a band that experiments and tries new styles without using the rage or aggression that much. Great album for all Incubus fans and traditional music lovers.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|When you hear the poignant intro to \\"Down to the Waterline\\" you know you're in for something special. This is simply one of the most imaginative and skillful debuts in rock. Dire Straits was a band with a truly original sound, a sound dependent upon the Mark Knopfler's incredible guitar virtuosity and song writing skills, ably backed up by a solid rhythm section.  Knopfler's guitar enhances the songs; they are not supplied for simple pyrotechnics. Lyrically, Knopfler shows a poet's sophistication; casually throwing out lines like, \\"A girl is high heeling it across the square,\\" and \\"Church bell clinging on just to try to get a crowd for Evensong.\\"  Life, love, loss are all topics that Knopfler handles with a sure hand, there is no confusion here. There is maturity here rarely found on debut recordings; Dire Straits makes it sound easy.
B0000025VU|5.0|This album came out when I was in 9th grade, just after I purchased my first<BR>Dylan album, Another Side of Bob Dylan (from 1964).  Infidels is very different<BR>from early Dylan, but it applies the literary power of his early work to a unique<BR>and focused rock style.  Not only is a great Dylan album, it has an ambience and <BR>sound that exists on no other album, by Dylan or anyone else.  Excellent balancing<BR>of lyrics and music.
B00005YTFG|2.0|This movie was highly recommended, so my wife and I watched it on VHS.  The most positive comment between the two of us was, \\"Well, it got...better\\".<br />Musicals are allowed some creative license, and I generally applaud attempts to be creative and unique.  But, I watched Moulin Rouge feeling as if someone came up with a hundred unrelated creative ideas and then force-fed them to the audience through an otherwise cliched plot vehicle of forbidden love.   Furthermore, many of the more original effects (such as the jerky camera movements) were so badly overused that they became obnoxious.<br />The movie constantly makes very abrupt changes between sappy melodrama and Vaudeville-type slapstick, which makes any attachment with the movie difficult.  It's hard to feel too much emotion for the dying heroine when you're watching grown men singing \\"Like a Virgin\\" to one another (incidently, that was THE single dumbest scene I've ever watched; I felt genuine pity for the actors).  <br />After several months, I still have no idea what the purpose of this movie was.  It seemed to want to glorify pop culture and make fun of it at the same time.  I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it should have caused me to feel SOMETHING for the characters, yet I found myself generally unconcerned about their fates.  My only emotion at the movie's end was despair over those two hours of my life I'd never get back.
6304711875|1.0|I don't understand the hype for such a bad movie. &quot;Scream&quot; is <BR>a version of hundreds of movies -especially made for TV- that were made in the late 70s and 80s. It doesn't bring anything new, it's not scary, we end up with the traditionnal group of students harassed by a mysterious murderer. Only goofy teenagers who are too young to know about the 70s/80s horror movie period might enjoy it.
0790742780|5.0|This film was great because it touches on the realities of everyday life.  If you are expecting strict realism in this movie it's not here.  This is a movie about modern urban tensions and one mans ultimate destruction by them.<br />The film touches on such elements as road rage, gangs, basic personal disrespect, and the feeling of helplessness a parent feels in the face of the dangers of today's world.  One has the sense Douglas is lost and no one can save him except perhaps the police officer played by Duvall.<br />Douglas plays a fellow who is an average guy going through a divorce who is treated with disrespect and contempt at every turn.  He feels his life has slipped away from him and that he has lost his family and all that matters most to him.  He runs into everything from people honking and yelling in backed up traffic to gang members violently accosting him, to immigrant shopkeepers charging what was an exorbitant price for the day for a can of soda.  The monster of the movie is the \\"system\\" of a society, which has a tendency to depersonalize, anonymize, and let people fall through the cracks.  Something in Douglas snaps at the beginning of the film and he begins to act out as many no doubt would like to do on some days.  In the end this course of action leads Douglas to self-destruction.  One wonders how often it happens in real life albeit through different modus operandi, real life being stranger than fiction after all.<br />Duvall on the other hand plays a cop close to retirement who as he learns more about Douglas and the developing situation begins to understand him.  To some extent Duvall's character serves to further develop Douglas's main character and in that respect is a vehicle of the storyline.  Duvall's character is a cop who goes out on a limb with Douglas and is about the only other character portrayed that is sympathetic to him.  Duvall's character is on the other hand the antithesis in many respects he has his career behind him and is married to a wife he loves.  He is about to retire and leave the madness of the city behind him.<br />Douglas on the other hand ultimately plays a man who is alone in a crowd of millions.<br />If you view this film strictly for the story itself without taking into account that it appears to be making a social commentary of sorts you might think the script somewhat weak.  If however you have witnessed or experienced the road rage, violence, and general lack of respect that goes on in every big American city every day then I think you will see the real point to it.<br />I think it's an excellent film with good performances by the main actors but then I like metaphorical films :) that go beyond the standard shoot `em ups once in awhile.  It's too bad that life can drive people to the breaking point but that's the modern reality I guess.
6304076517|3.0|As the opening credits state, this is an adaptation of the play by Shakespeare.  I feel it is more of a retelling or an interpretation of The Tempest.  The characters are there, but unless you are very familiar with play, this movie will leave you a little bewildered.  If you don't know who is who going into the film, you will have to stop and do some reading.<br />From the change of the scenery and the change of narration, you are in the play, in the character's head, and watching the play.  This perspective changes to draw your attention.  This manner is quite engaging.<br />Nonetheless, there is a lot of nudity and interpretive dance.  If these are not your cups of tea, then I would recommend giving this a skip.  It can be a little distracting if you are watching this for the Shakespeare connection.  You need to watch this for the film work.
B00004Z400|3.0|Some may say: even one star is too much, cause we have only Elite on here. Forget Deftones and switch to Five Pointe O.<br />Others may think: well, if you're really crazy about Elite, you may as well like Korea, and Passenger. Besides, there are two nice sleep pills on the cd: Change, and Digital Bath. Three stars would work, and you can also try Flaw.<br />There are definitely those who would happily scream: that's just the best by Deftones. Do we have enough stars available to vote? There's nothing like Deftones at all.<br />So, why don't we all get a compromise?
B000002572|5.0|There were better albums in the '70s (&quot;Layla,&quot; &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; &quot;Exile on Main Street,&quot; and &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; come to mind), but no album represents the best of the '70s rock sound better than Boston's self-titled debut.  Boston created a sound that combines the power and intensity of hard rock with the refined smoothness and accessibility of pop.  And the first side of the original LP (&quot;More Than a Feeling,&quot; &quot;Piece of Mind,&quot; &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;) may be rock's best answer to the symphony.  A masterpiece.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this LINKIN PARK CD for their #1 hit &quot;CRAWLING&quot;. After hearing that one for about 200 times and getting it out of my system, I started listening to the rest of the album and giving the other songs a chance. This five man band is out of control with talent. Even though the lyrics are a bit repetitive, there is great truth  in their words. This music is so contagious I bought a second CD, so now I have one in my house and one in my car and now I never leave home without it.
B00004S3AN|5.0|&quot;Time Out&quot; is both one of the most musically important, and one of the most accessible, albums in mainstream jazz.  &quot;Blue Rondo&quot; is a classic, and &quot;Take Five&quot; may be the most famous (and memorable) composition in jazz - period.<br />But my meager descriptions won't do &quot;Time Out&quot; justice.

B000001FT0|4.0|&quot;Talking Back to the Night&quot; is relatively average early '80s pop-rock.  Following Winwood's uninteresting self-titled solo debut and unlistenable sophomore release &quot;Arc of a Diver,&quot; however, it sounds like a minor masterpiece.  While still weighed down by a few lifeless songs (&quot;Big Girls Walk Away,&quot; &quot;It Was Happiness&quot;) and cheesy synthesizers, &quot;Talking Back...&quot; actually features several great songs.  &quot;Valerie&quot; was a precursor of pop genius to come, pop-rock anthem &quot;Still in the Game&quot; is probably Winwood's most underappreciated recording, and &quot;And I Go&quot; and &quot;There's a River&quot; are his earliest successes at strong adult contemporary ballads.  Furthermore, Winwood's synthesizer technique begins maturing here into a distinct and original sound (which he would later perfect on songs like &quot;The Finer Things&quot;), rather than an artificial replacement for other instruments.  It took three albums, but Winwood finally found his voice as a solo artist with this release.

B00003CXI1|5.0|This was a fun and fine movie in overall, and the five stars are just for the movie itself, one of Chris Columbus's best along with 'Home Alone'. One of the reasons for giving five stars is the acting: Alan Rickman did a very great job, and Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane were both excellent in their roles. And from the young actors, there were some small flaws, but Tom Felton's acting was the best.<BR> <BR>Now when it comes to rating the DVD, I'll have to give 4 stars. The special features were a little dissapointing: There was only one interview, no interview from the actors, and the other features such as the self-guide tour around Hogwarts was a little weak: the picture quality wasn't very good. And of course, there was the complicated excess to the deleted scenes. It was a bit entertaing at first, complicating also. But whenever I want to see the deleted scenes again, it gets very annoying, keep going through the same steps all over again. <BR> But there are some good points,too. The library with the album of the main characters was helpful because I could watch some of my favorite scenes without searching the DVD. Also, the deleted scenes were great. They almost make up for the flaws in the special features disc.

B000002G87|5.0|One can hardly use too many superlatives when describing &quot;Layla...&quot;  It is one of the essential recordings of British blues, of '60s rock, of '70s rock (since it straddles two decades), of blues-rock, of guitar-rock, and of rock 'n' roll in general.  From the searing blues of &quot;Key to the Highway,&quot; to the passion of &quot;Little Wing&quot; and &quot;Bell Bottom Blues,&quot; this album represents everything that Clapton fans love about him.  Of course, the title track is a musical monument in its own right, and its two halves (driving blues-rock opening, soothing but emotional instrumental coda) neatly summarize the entire album.  And, you know it's a great record when you find yourself loving lesser-known album tracks even better than its radio classics.  &quot;Keep on Growing&quot; and &quot;Anyday&quot; are, in this reviewer's humble opinion, simply transcendent.<br />When people insist on listening to &quot;classic rock&quot; stations, and claim that no one makes good records nowadays, &quot;Layla&quot; may very well be what they have in mind.  It's what great rock is supposed to be.
B000066I6N|4.0|'Dreamland' is a superb album, proving that the guys I grew up with (Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, David Bowie) still beat the snot out of the muck that's vomitted daily on MTV. Plant doing a cover album seemed a little dubious to me until I listened to it. He pretty much owns 'Morning Dew' as far as I'm concerned. 'Darkness, Darkness' is my favorite song on the album &amp; 'Song To The Siren' is one of the most beautiful melodies I've ever heard. Plant's take is reminiscent of 'The Rain Song' from his Led Zep days. Another song that's interesting to listen to is 'One More Cup of Coffee'. The White Stripes do a version of it too, &amp; their take is how I would picture Plant doing it &amp; vice versa. This album is as good as 'Fate of Nations' &amp; a wonderful follow up to 'Walking Into Clarksdale'. Do yourself a favor &amp; pick it up.

630157401X|4.0|Steven Spielberg and the Indiana Jones series needed a serious boost after the utterly dreadful Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Enter Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which hearkens back to the rollicking fun of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Once again, Indy (Harrison Ford) is doing battle with the Nazis in a race to find the legendary Holy Grail. Along the way, however, he must rescue his dad, played to perfection by Sean Connery. While it falls just short of the enjoyment of Raiders, this film keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with a series of mini-climaxes on the way to the exciting finish. In addition, the opening sequence is a treat for true fans of the series as it reveals the origins of a great many details about Indy. Again, few films will ever match the thrills of Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Last Crusade tries valiently and it comes close. Its worth a rental at the very least, and certainly would be a worthy addition to any video or DVD collection.
B000002GW5|5.0|Move over, Eagles - &quot;Running on Empty&quot; is '70s California country-rock at its best.  The title track and &quot;Load Out/Stay&quot; are FM radio classics, but everything in between is equally strong, from the folk-blues of &quot;Cocaine&quot; to the summer anthem &quot;You Love the Thunder.&quot;  This is Jackson Browne at his best, the &quot;road album&quot; at its best, and '70s rock at its best.  A truly essential recording.
B00003CY6M|4.0|You can have a lot of fun tracking the career of John Cusack. He started out as the crazy teen in movies like ÒBetter Off DeadÓ and ÒThe Sure Thing,Ó and he came into his own in the romantic-comedy-drama, ÒSay Anything.Ó Since then, he has done black comedy (ÒGrosse Pointe BlankÓ), drama (ÒThe GriftersÓ), offbeat (ÒBeing John MalkovichÓ) and action (ÒCon AirÓ). But he still seems at his best in the romantic comedy, and is the highlight of ÒSerendipity.Ó<br />Cusack plays a TV producer who falls head over heels for a psychologist, played to perfection by Kate Beckinsale, even though the two meet by chance for only a few hours one Christmas. Several years later, both are engaged to others, but still canÕt get each other out of their minds. ÒSerendipityÓ is a well-paced exercise in frustration, as we root for the chance lovers to find each other but watch as they march toward fates that neither seems to fully embrace. Yet, as every good romantic comedy must do, it rewards the viewer with a satisfying, if unconventional, ending that makes the movie worth watching again and again.<br />Simply based on its reputation, I added ÒSerendipityÓ to my DVD collection. After watching it, I have added it to my regular viewing rotation. ItÕs a good date movie, but more than that, itÕs just fun to watch.
0783117523|4.0|I have to imagine that the toughest films to pull off are the ones on the verge of cliche-dom; a familiar premise that still manages to flawlessly hook you. 'Gia' covers much trodden ground. By now, it's a natural stereotype- the model who blows her looks, her career and her youthful optimism on drugs.  <BR>   <BR>   If the premise is so well known, how did 'Gia' avoid the E True Hollywood Movie trap? Angelina Jolie was simply too convincing, the directing was simply too unique and the script was too crafty. This film avoided the averageness of countless other 'drug films' simply by painting a mosaic so raw, that you couldn't help but love, hate, cringe at and root for Gia at the same time. The film, while letting you glimpse into the insecurities and motivations of our tragic hero, consistently pushed her just out of reach so as to keep us puzzled and curious. All said and done, though, Jolie and the gang have created a flawless work of tragic art.<br />   The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that as most movies based on life stories, it is a bit anti-climactic and unbalanced. With most plots, the writers are at liberty to create an upward story with a clear climax and this film simply didn't have it. It slid up and down, high and low, mirroring Gia's confusion. Although it didn't detract from the film's emotion- believe me, it still comes through- it just left the film feeling a bit muddled.
B00000JZI9|4.0|One of the most entertaining genres of the late-1960s and early-1970s was the Western. These films prolonged Jimmy StewartÕs career and made legends out of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. However, in the years between the Wayne-era and the time that Lawrence Kasdan made ÒSilverado,Ó there were few -- if any -- Westerns that were truly crowd-pleasers. Thank God, then, for ÒSilverado.Ó<br />Kasdan has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink in this film, but somehow has balanced out the seemingly-endless aspects of ÒSilverado.Ó It has star power in its leads (Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner), as well as a host of great supporting characters (Brian Dennehy, John Cleese, Linda Hunt, Rosanna Arquette and Jeff Goldblum). It has action from the opening scene until the close. And it has a plot that is both interesting and plausible.<br />While ÒSilveradoÓ doesnÕt rank as one of the best Westerns of all time, it is a rollicking good time and worth adding to your collection, because youÕll find yourself watching it time-and-time-again.
B000068PQ0|1.0|this is the weakest album the Lips have released in years.  the candyass sound of the album is proof positive the pink robots won.  this is where you really feel Ronald Jones's departure -- i wonder what it'd be like if this band picked up a guitar again.  the eerie, day-glo slickness of 'The Soft Bulletin' managed to accomodate the corporeal and physical nature of ROCK in the DRUMS and RHYTHMS -- Bonham sized beats and bass -- and it did it.  this album and its neutered, programmed, overly digitized character does not do it.<br />there's ghost in the machine: i'm partial to 'Fight Test' and 'Are You a Hypnotist?' although i find the cheaply emotional  key changes of 'Do You Realize?' irritating and the ill-advised electro-jap-rock pastiche of 'Yoshimi, pt. II' base.  personally, i think they should have more to show for hanging out with the Boredoms.  it's like they've got their heads up their [bums].  oh, and i almost forgot -- the Lips are presently touring with Cake!... people, they and this are not cool enough to dredge up Cake!!  it's not right.  <br />i'm not saying don't buy it, whatever.  go ahead and hear it, you'll see.  just for godsakes don't go on praising it as the album of the year out of hallucination or legitimation of your purchase.  please!
B00006690H|5.0|Ok first off I'd say it's a brilliant album for young kids and for parents who don't like swearing.It has a few bad words ...BR>...,but they aren't strong ones so i think your parents won't mind.His first song off this album is without me. a fun single.<BR>His best one would have to be 'White America'.It's a strong song.<BR>Business is another fun song and in Halie's song he actually sings!.But i'd recommend him sticking to rap.If you're not sure about buying this album listen to the previews.If you think it's not to be good you'll be suprised because it's excellent.A must by for Rap/Hip-Hop fans.EMINEM RULZ!!!!!!...But he sure ...is going to picture it!  Homosexual jokes, jokes about rape, murder ( if you want to call them jokes...)  and what is especially offensive to many, is in one song a joke about Sandra Leavy.   I hope you make the right choice!  ...At the end of the song, after visciously stating his opinions about America, he says, \\"I'm just playin', you know I love you America.\\"  I think that he says this just to stop critics from attacking him for this song.  If such is the case, he needs to stop apologizing, because he is right--his agressors are wrong.other in a non dissing way.<BR>5. Square Dance ... - a great song. he disses Canibus on this song and gives props to Nas and Dre.<BR>6. The Kiss (Skit) ... - Hilarious skit where he puts a funny take on what happen the night when he say his wife kissing a bouncer.<BR>7. Solider ... - A great song.<BR>8. Say Goodbye Hollywood *** - Didn't really like the song, but the beat is good.<BR>9. Drips (featuring Obie Trice) ... - The worst song on the whole album.<BR>10. Without Me  ... - The first single where he raps about how the music and entertainment industry hasnt been the same without him.<BR>11. Paul Rosenberg (skit) ... - a skit where his manager tells him to stop carrying his gun.<BR>12. Sing For The Moment... - My favorite song on the whole album. and it is so true. he raps about white kids and familysbeing affected by rap and how kids look up to rappers and idolize them. it also carrys the hook from \\"Dream On\\" by Aerosmith.<BR>13. Superman (featuring Dina Rae) ... - a funny song.<BR>14. Hailie's Song ... - He \\"sings\\" for and about his daughter, one of the nicest songs i've ever heard.<BR>15. Steve Berman (skit) - ... - Eminem finally gets fed up with steve talkin s... about his albums.<BR>16. When The Music Stops (featuring D-12) ***** - A really good and funny song.<BR>17. Say What You Say (featuring Dr. Dre) ... - A great song where Eminem and Dre get on Jermaine Dupri and at the end so does Timbaland.<BR>18. Till I Collapse (featuring Nate Dogg) ... - My third favorite song on the album with a great beat, and it's Eminem at his best.<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy (featuring Hailie Jade Mathers) ... - I think this is a really nice song where he put his daughter on.<BR>20. Curtains Close (skit) ... - really didn't need it.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie is one of the *worst* movies I have ever seen.  It ranks right up there with Rollerball in terms of horrible scriptwriting.  There are so many massive plot holes that it makes my head hurt.  My friends and I saw this movie and upon the end of it couldn't stop laughing and then promptly demanded for a refund for our movie tickets.  <br />The movie was a good horror flick right up until the last half hour or so.  It seems like the writers just sort of winged an ending.  The writers must have some sort of anathema against a decent ending ...<br />Rent something else.  Even the new Jason In Space (Jason X or whatnot) is a better flick.
B000068PQ0|5.0|Simply put this is a beautiful and haunting album from the Flaming lips. Following up the critically lauded &quot;the soft bulletin&quot; could for many bands be a severe challenge, but the lips traverse this obstacle with the ease of a band that knows  exactly were they are at musically. Songs like &quot;fight test&quot; and the 2 part title track &quot;Yoshimi battles the pink robots&quot; are effortless in their grace. Combining elements of electronic music with heartbreaking melody the Flaming lips manage to deliver a concept album that genuinely moves the listener.<br />I defy anyone to listen to &quot;do you realize?&quot; and not be touched by the poignant yet stunningly simple lyrics. A true classic, even if everyone doesn't think so.
B000002O1Q|5.0|This is one of those records that I haven't listened to in a long while but definitely had an impact on me back when it first came out. I saw the re-grouped Blasters perform at a blues festival yesterday and all of the memories of this record and the movie came rushing back. Prior to hearing &quot;Blue Shadows&quot; in the movie I had not heard the Blasters. It is still one of my favorite cuts.
0345410025|5.0|The 2nd chapter of this book starts out with what I believe is the most important key to improving memory: Association.  This involves clearly VISUALIZING the object that you want to recall, \\"and linking it to something you already know\\" and it should be visualized in some way that is EXAGGERATED or RIDICULOUS.<br />I teach speed reading to children and this one key is EXTREMELY helpful for getting children from ages 8 on up to begin remembering what they are speed reading.  <br />One key thing that I have noticed, that Lorayne and Lucas don't mention in the book, is this:  Kids with ADHD and Dyslexia are often VERY GIFTED visually and hence often have GIFTED MEMORIES!!  I have noticed that they sometimes even have PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORIES (Which also makes them great speed readers).  I wouldn't be surprised if both Harry Lorayne and Jerry Lucas were Dyslexic or ADHD.<br />--George Stancliffe, author of SPEED READING 4 KIDS
B000066I6N|5.0|Well, yesterday was a day that I will always remember. July 21, 1973 at the Providence Civic Center 8 pm. I saw Led Zep play a concert that was the best $6.50 I ever spent at the age of 14. It was about a week after Houses of the Holy came out. Now, 29 years later his voice is still strong and the new band is great. Robert, I know that you read these reviews here at Amazon, and I wanted to thank you for the dinner we had together on July 10, 1990 at Great Woods, Ma and that great show. And it was fun buzzing around backstage with you on the Go-Ped motorized skateboards with Andrea. I caught your show on Letterman in NYC when you just released Dreamland. We will meet again. Your friend from Newport, RI......

B00004Z459|5.0|I LOVE this cd!!  But I'm just too lazy to go out and buy it haha.  It has great music and idk I just love it!  I find it relaxing...haha yes relaxing.  I'm just unusually unusual like that =).  I recomend this cd to anyone who likes rock and even if you don't it's good!  And (duh) that's why I give it a 5 star rating!!
0375703861|3.0|The reviews I read were wonderful, and I got this book for Christmas.  The beginning was engaging.  The descriptions of Clara and her experiences were dynamite.  I was loving this book.  Then, somewhere about 1/3 of the way through, I had no idea why this person was here or that person was there, and it bogged down.  I completely lost interest.
0385503954|3.0|I agree with everyone that this was a great write - a great read.  Nevertheless, it also took me about 150 pages in to decide to keep reading instead of putting it down.  Then I was hooked.  But the ending left me feeling used.  That's all.
0156012197|5.0|This has become the standard guide book for behavior.  First read as an adult, I now expect any new friend to have read it.  Also great for reading aloud, especially while traveling, whether kids or adults are in the audience.  The language is poetic and easily accessed, even in translation.  The lessons in behavior are universal, kind, as well as thought provoking.<BR>Honestly, would you be friends with anyone who hasn't read <BR>The Little Prince?

B00003CXI1|3.0|this is for all the people who wrote really bad reviews for Harry Potter. a lot of you had appalling spelling mistakes in your reviews, and i think rather than criticizing Harry Potter you should go and learn to spell. as for the movie it was pretty good. it could definitely have been better, and funnier, and i am mad at Harry for having blue eyes rather than green, but it was still OK.
0812550706|5.0|I loved this book and this series.  Orson Scott Card is a marvelous story teller.  The plot is wonderful, the character development is fantastic, and the ending is marvelous.  There is nothing bad I can say for this book and it is little wonder it has won several awards and is now being developed into a movie.<br />But don't stop with this book.  The adventure continues with the other books written on these characters through the eyes of not only Ender but of his right-hand man (boy), Bean.
B000003S0B|4.0|The general tone in the reviews of KC's second effort is that<br />it is an OK sequel but not on a par with their first masterpiece<br />\\"In the court of the Crimson King\\". Let me argue why in my opinion it is actually superior. The two outstanding tracks on their first record arguably are \\"Epitaph\\" (though the the BBC-recording is even better) and \\"In the Court..\\". The mellow<br />\\"I talk to the wind \\" is alright, but \\"21th century Schizoid man\\" and \\"Moonchild\\" [are weak]. Now, as to their second effort, the<br />title track \\"In the wake of Poseidon\\" is as good as it gets, and matches the BBC-Epitaph. I just love this bombastic organ and mellotron sound, which still does not drown Lake's voice! The jazzy \\"Pictures of a City\\" somehow paralles \\"21th century s. man\\" but is much more palatable. One has to be in the right  mood for \\"Devil's triangle\\" but then it is absolutely thrilling! Listening to it loud enough it literally scares the hell out of you. I'm not aware of any comparable piece of music, not even by King Crimson themselves!<br />What an incredible synth [part], without any guitar nota bene. Surely, \\"In the wake of Poseidon\\" plus \\"Devils gate\\" together outweigh \\"Epitaph\\" plus \\"In the court of the Crimson King\\". Still not agreeing? Well, then add \\"Pictures of a city\\" and the catchy<br />rythms of \\"Cat food\\" to definitely tip the balance. I almost gave it 5 stars, maybe I should have.
B000066AXC|4.0|I was enchanted by this film which I bought for our library.  I am Patient's Librarian at a state run mental health institution.  I take issue with the idea of going off meds of course, most people don't make it if they do.  Mr. Nash had much help and the film glosses over how much trouble it was but the film does a sensative job of presenting how difficult life is ON MEDS or OFF MEDS for schizophrenic patients.  I am going to get the book on tape so my (blind)mathematician husband can evaluate the story from that angle.
B00004RKIJ|2.0|With their screeched falsetto singing and synth based disco beats, it's obvious where the Communards roots lay. They are eighties dance pop mavins from the gay pick up scene (think Pet Shop Boys or Bronski Beat), not surprisingly, there music has not aged well. Those nostalgic for the time may enjoy them, but their dated boogie will win no converts, at least not until 80's retro really comes into it's own.
0790749815|5.0|This is probably Hitchcock's greatest film.  It stands up alongside REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO as his great opus.<br />Cary Grant teams with Hitchcock for the fourth and final time in this benchmark espionage journey that was recently judged by the AFI as one of their top 100 films.<br />Grant plays a Madison Avenue executive who becomes mistaken for a Government agent by a team of spies led by James Mason.  He unwillingly becomes involved in a series of misadventures and is pursued across the States by both the spies and the Government whilst being helped along the way by a beautiful ice-cool blonde secret agent (Eva Marie Saint).<br />This all-new restoration boasts a beautiful Dolby 5.1 sound mix and a pristine picture.  Outstading acting, the unforgettable cropdusting sequence and Bernard Herrmann's nerve-jangling score all combine in this classic, superlative Hitchcock.<br />Also featuring Jessie Royce Landis.<br />The DVD includes the retrospective featurette &quot;Destination Hitchcock: The Making of 'North By Northwest'&quot; hosted by Eva Marie Saint, TV spots, trailers, audio commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, still gallery and a music-only track.

B00005JL3A|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch if you're not the Resident Evil fan but if you are you probably think different.  I enjoyed the movie but the problem with this movie is I have a hard time remembering it.  It was pretty forgettable because the storyline was pretty thin.  The actors gave pretty good performances.  If you haven't seen the movie, I would rent it first and then buy it because it is violent and thin storylined.  This is not for children.  All in all this was a good movie but if you are a Resident Evil fan you may not like this.
B00005JKCF|3.0|Incredible special effects in this vivid telling of how Spider-Man came to be, well, Spider-Man. Maguire is good in the lead. All style and no substance, but it does do a good job of explaining the character's history. No one who reads the original Marvel comics will remember Spidey getting in the ring with Macho Man (but then again, they've probably never heard of the EVIL DEAD, which would be a blessing if they haven't), but this film is a worthy companion to the excellent animated series produced in the 90s upon which its based. Raimi's direction is not Oscar material, but at least he didn't use that god-awful shaki-cam (or Sam Ram-a-cam). Rated PG-13; mild carnage and violence.
B000000OQF|4.0|This is a good album for rock fans.  This album released in 1987 features 3 top ten hits &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; which hit 1 for 2 weeks and &quot;Paradise City&quot;.  This album stayed on the charts for 147 weeks and sold a whopping 15 million copies.  I recommend this album to rock fans but not to people who want something a little less mean.  This album is not for children.
0446608955|5.0|This was a great book!!!!!!! it was very moving. i am a pre-teen and all my friends and i love this book. it is so realistic, you really get to know the jamie and landon. this is not a book that I will forget in a month. The story is great! landon, the popular guy at school in the late 50's is in a play with jamie and ends up falling in love with her. there is so much more! this true page-turner made me beg for mmore when I finished it. i saw the movie before reading the book but found new surprises on every page. i love this book!!!!!!!
B000003TAW|5.0|I bought this cd the other day because I decided to give Weezer a chance. I'm very glad I bought it. This album is gonna go down as being one of the most important albums in history. Everything on it is amazing. &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; is breath taking. The lyrics are works of poetry and the guitar solo is one of the best I've ever heard; it's simple, yet the sound of it is just great. BUY THIS ALBUM! You won't regret it!
B000067CPX|5.0|mature, tight, deep, etc, etc.  it's all been said already, so what can i add?  'by the way' not only extends'californication's themes and emotions but adds menace and unease. songs like 'dosed' and 'don't forget me' give hints to some new sense of mortality lacking in earlier stuff like 'upbeat mofo..'.  maybe it's keidis hitting 40 (!!!), but this album is the most rounded to date.  it has the highs & funk of youth & energy but also the depths and sobriety of age and the realisation that the party won't last forever. a beautiful album that shows they're still the best at what they do and most new rock/metal bands have a [heck] of a lot of work to do.
B0000028RR|1.0|I had the misfortune of buying this album when it was first released.  Yeah, it's got some decent highschool headbanger stuff on it, most notably the infamous \\"F--K YOU I WON'T DO WATCHA TELL ME!\\" rant that drones on forever.  Maybe in my youth this album had some appeal.  Not now, though.<br />I've had a few years to grow up.  Having listened to this album again for the first time in a long time, I find Rage's presentation to be proverbial tale of the idiot: full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.  It's unreformed sophomoric \\"break stuff for the sake of breaking stuff\\" music, laced with goofy socialist and anarchist prattle.<br />Moreover, it's impossible to take Rage Against The Machine seriously knowing how many millions this band and its component members have raked in over the years.  Hey guys, cry me a river.  You live a rock and roll life far away from the every day world of work-a-day struggle.  All the fist-in-air rhetoric is just silly considering that none of you schmoes have any clue what it's like to work an honest job.<br />Impressionable and disaffected youth will eat this album up, as has been the case from the beginning.  Speaking as a formerly disaffected youth who grew the hell up and now holds a responsible position in the very society that Rage claims to hate so much, I am embarrassed that I ever gave this band any ear.  I think I'll donate my copy to the Home For Unreformed Anarchist Socialist America Haters.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril, what a breath of fresh air!!!!  It's amazing how much talent we really do have in this great land we live in.  Move over, Britney, Christina, Avril has a totally different sound, and i believe she wuill not follow in the mainstream as the aformentioned young women. Everyone is talking about this young lady from Napanee ON both here, and in the United States.  This Cd really Rocks!!!  Avril is building a huge fan base here in Canada, and I believe she eventaully will in the US as well.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Considering that this authentic English band is still touring and recording new material, some 30 years after breaking onto the late 60's pop rock scene, Jethro Tull crested fast and early with a true colossus among concept albums: Thick As A Brick.<br />Perhaps it is unfair to Tull's other work--the bulk of which lies after the release of TAAB--to classify this one album as the most inspired.  Certainly albums like the romping Songs From The Wood deserve recognition as being fan favorites.  Indeed, the key to Tull's longevity has been their ability to blend innovation with clacissism, new with old, bulwarked by Ian Anderson's minstrel genius.  But if you were to look across Tull's lengthy family tree and pluck one child from the horde as being the best among all, TAAB is it.<br />I won't take much time describing the mechanics of the album.  Others have already done that.  What I will say is that this is the first Tull album I ever purchased, and in some ways it is the only Tull album anyone ever need purchase if they want to listen to Jethro Tull distilled down to its purest form.  Rolicking, irreverent, thumbing its nose at the edifice of Western English culture and yet paying solemn homage to that culture in the same breath.  TAAB is a paradoxical album whose unheard of length (for its time) seems barely large enough to contain the musical explosion within.<br />In many ways Jethro Tull is the unsung hero of the 1960's Brit pop rock scene.  Rarely guilty of penning mindlessly fluffy diddies, Tull is the quirky brainiac brother of better known and celebrated groups like the Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, and David Bowie.  Beneath the pattented Ian Anderson street persona--with its Aqualungian hairdo and unkept mein--lies the sharp collective mind of an enlightenment renaissance master.<br />And the master's full arsenal of talent is on gorgeous display in this one great album!<br />One final note: for those interested in Tull's efforts to recapture the grandeur of Thick As A Brick, check out A Passion Play, the sister concept album to TAAB.  A Passion Play is different from TAAB in the same way that just about every Tull album is different from its siblings, but A Passion Play comes closest to reduxing the dizzying glory of TAAB.<br />Another final final note: Tull is still on the road, so please please please take some time to go see this historic rock group before the guys grow too weary of the life and close down the show for good!  I saw Tull in concert at the cozy Seattle Opera House in 1999 and I must say that it was by far the BEST rock concert I have ever been too.  Bar none.

B000066NW0|3.0|If you're into pop music with supposedly &quot;thoughtful&quot; lyrics, then this is the album for you.  But for the rest, let me just say that, at the end, it's no different from other pop artists.<br />I bought this album because someone told me she's simmilar to Alanis Morissette, but turns out that the only things simmilar among the 2 are the fact that they both play the guitar and come from Canada.  Bottom line: Lavigne is just another creation by the pop industry.  You have been warned.
B0000027D5|5.0|This is not only the best album Santana ever made, it is among the best albums I own (of many hundreds).  Lotus captures Santana live in the 1970s, when the band was at its jazziest.  There are a few vocals here, on Black Magic Woman for example, and they are good.  But most of the album is made up of instrumental jams, and they are creative, exciting -- Carlos Santana at his best, along with strong performances by bandmates such as Tom Coster on organ.  Fans of Abraxas, one of Santana's most popular albums, will be pleased to hear long, superb versions of Incident at Neshabur and Samba Pa Ti. Anyone with an interest in jazz-rock style music or Santana should check out this album.
B00005JKJA|1.0|You know the scene, your kids insist on watching Fantasia over and over again. You try to justify this to your brain for its classical, experimenting artsy-fartsy appeal, but nothing can be as boring and unsatisfying as Mulholland Dr. <br />Formula for a guaranteed boring movie: dragging out almost every scene, subplots in the film that are better left on the edit room floor and an ending that demands the two and half hours of your life back. This film had it all!
B000067CPX|5.0|While I believe the band is more together here than I have heard a band in a long time, it is Anthony's vocals that make this effort so spectacular.  Who could have thought that four men could produce an album with 16 top quality tracks including my favorite, Tear.  This song has been in my head and my dreams ever since I heard it, but it is only one of many diverse masterpieces.  If you were looking for the hard side of RHCP it is in there in the lyrics, but being superbly masked by the soft melodies.
0385491026|4.0|I would give this book a 4  star rating if it were possible. What keeps it from being a 5-star is the lack of better editing that could have made some parts less repetitive. However, the book is completely engrossing and well-crafted. Some of Atwood's observations are so poignant and finely shaded, it left me wishing I had written them.    I didn't find the flashback scenes confusing. After the first few sections, the pattern of what is the present and what was the past became obvious: the first chapter of every section, except the last, dealt with the present while the remaining chapters of each section were flashbacks/memories.     I think most women who grew up with brothers and/or have more guy friends than girl friends will relate well to this book. Being one of those women, I found Atwood's rendering of the intricacies of girls' play versus boys' quite interesting and on the mark. It seems that women who grew up with sisters know how to play these games well while women who grew up without sisters sometimes get tripped up.    But while the childhood torment shapes Elaine and influences her life in profound ways, it is by no means the only story. Elaine and her friends grow up. Elaine and Cordelia become friends in high school where the power balance shifts. Reasons why Cordelia, the main \\"antagonist,\\" becomes a sort of emotional bully and why her character, her vitality slowly fades become sadly clearer.     At the same time, because her friendship with Cordelia so powerfully shapes Elaine, she feels Cordelia's influence throughout her life even when she no longer sees her friend. At times, she seems even to hear Cordelia's voice and follow in her painful footsteps. The  Toronto retrospective of Elaine's artwork allows her to come back and face the memories and figure out why Cordelia needed to emotionally abuse Elaine and why Elaine can understand and forgive Cordelia after all these years. In a way, they needed each other because they were looking for the same thing: friendship and acceptance.     The imaginative descriptions of Elaine's art workwere almost too much! While reading the book, I envied how creative Atwood's mind really was. While writing this magnificent book, she also conjured up in her writing some powerful visual images.     Finally, Atwood's ability to tell a very real and human story against the back drop of the feminist movement was exciting and nuanced. She illustrated the impact the women's movement had on relationships between the character and other women artists and Elaine and her husband. At the same time, she conveyed a sense of how difficult it was to find a comfortable position in a powerful movement; for example, how does a woman embrace feminism without feeling as if she has to give up all symbols of \\"female oppression,\\" such as wanting to look pretty, shaving one's legs, having a child WITH a HUSBAND? While some may say these issues are dated in today's world, they seem relevant still when women have to justify why they do/don't identify themselves as \\"feminists.\\" Or why they have to qualify the label.    This book is superbly written and realized.
B00005NWM3|2.0|I liked the song/video for How You Remind Me, and Nickelback hails from my hometown, so I decided to buy the CD. I'm really disappointed. <br />All of the intuitive lyrics and emotion of How You Remind Me were pretty much dumped for the rest of the CD. It's too abusive and hard. It's just all the same notes, heavily distorted, and a lot of yelling.<br />Also, even though it's not labeled, this CD is full with Explicit Lyrics, making it sound worse to me.

B0000636UN|3.0|I feel like &quot;C'mon, C'mon&quot;, Sheryl Crow's latest disc deserves three and half stars.  But I don't think it's quite worthy of four.  Don't get me wrong; it's not a bad album by any means.  &quot;Soak Up the Sun&quot; is a catchy little ditty, &quot;It's So Easy&quot; is a nice duet with Don Henley, and &quot;Diamond Road&quot; and the title track, both of which feature Stevie Nicks on backing vocals, are lovely.  Yet it doesn't add up to much.  While a few of the songs have an introspective feel, the rest seem rather empty and slick.  I'm not against music that just sounds good, but I like it to do more than that, and I feel that Sheryl Crow is an artist with enough talent to make music that really says something.  She seems to have lost her way a little, but I don't mind going along for the ride.  If nothing else, it'll sound good.

1577311523|4.0|Well, there are a lot of spiritual books out there.  And there will be lots more to come.  Why?  Well, spirituality is about being, not dogma, and we are all individuals.  Just as we all have different narratives about, for instance, our journey of self-discovery and learning of language, we will all have different stories for our discovery of spirit.  Or at least I hope the _majority_ of us develop such stories or we will be another short footnote in the history of life on this planet.<br />What books are useful or perhaps even groundbreaking?  Some stories involve three-day courses where people are given 'authentic Indian names' at the end and told they are great shamans or yogis.  Unfortunately there is no such thing as McDonald's spirituality - the process of uncovering being is, in 99.99999% of the cases (just look at how many 'great' spiritual leaders we have had in the history of our race) a rather arduous and painful one.<br />Tolle had a revelation (which he does not give details about) quite a number of years ago.  He has lived since then in relative seclusion in Canada, Vancouver to be exact.  This book is the culmination of his spiritual growth - written because he feels strongly about trying to get out a message to Westerners.<br />This is where this book excels.  There is little new here for anyone who has deep experience in Eastern spirituality such as Zen or Taoism; nor is there little new for anyone who has completed deep practice in shamanism.  The key is deep practice:  there is no free lunch here!  Tolle makes this point frequently by interspersing the book with symbols representing 'pauses' where you are supposed to do some work.  A great idea.<br />Tolle's focus is to give a more Western path for confronting the insanity of the ego.  He goes through the 'why' portion and then moves into some general overviews of the 'how'.  I thought his blending of different religions was done in an artful manner and several friends who have borrowed the book have had the same comment.  Much like Stephen Mitchell, Tolle manages to tweak the best out of the mostly-corroded shell of Christianity.<br />For anyone considering starting this very important journey, this book is a good place to start.  Then find a master and start practising your own way.have had the same comment.

B000068QY7|5.0|Took a brief time for the album to grow on me, so I'm glad I didn't immediately write a review because it would've been a less glowing one.<br />Plenty of rock 'n' roll songs on this album, but it's clear that Oasis is broadening its reach while at the same time maintaining that 'oasis' sound.  Songbird (yes, Liam can write decent songs) and She is Love are quite nice and understated.  Better Man rocks with an irrestible groove.  But without doing a complete rundown I can just say there are plenty of standout tracks here.  And the lyrics work well, too.
B00002Z88D|5.0|...S&M has taken some of Metallica's best songs and, essentially, gold-plated them.  Songs like, 'Ktulu', 'Memory', 'Hero', 'Bleeding', 'Nothing', and 'Outlaw' are now even greater than their studio originals because of Kamen's genius and Metallica's skill as a live band.<br />S&M is an absolute masterpiece, both heavy and symphonic.  You may not find this to be the case if:<BR>              <BR>             a) ...<br />             b) you are not hearing S&M at its full potential<br />If your reason was the latter, I suggest the S&M DVD in Dolby 5.1 Digital Surround Sound.  You can follow different band members during certain songs, see the uncensored documentary, and hear the whole concert without the orchestra or without the band....<br />If you're a fan, you'll either love it immediately, or like it and grow to love it as you listen to it more and more.  <br />Metallica will never die, and I challenge all who oppose them to 12 rounds (if they can last that long).
038532653X|4.0|I thought Skellig was a very enjoyable and mysterious book, but was a little bit complicated for young children at eleven. The author has used very distinctive words to express the character of Skellig, Mina, Micheal and Micheal's dad. He uses very powerful words that a younger child could pick up and use which means it's not suitable for children under 9. If I had picked up another one of his books, either Kits Wilderness or Secret Heart, I would probably pick it up to read.

The ONLY thing about it that I think could have been better is the cover art work -- it resembles &quot;Black Out&quot; too much.

0783226837|3.0|trmours was a great film. the hilariously bad one-liners, combined with the horrible acting (by some people), mixed with the failed attempts to scare me into watching the rest of the movie really made it worth watching. I doubt that you'll find a movie that will make you laugh harder. Where Ghostbusters got stupid, Tremors keeps on truckin'. no explanations, no nothing, and the girl didn't even get naked! This is definately  a flick to watch with a group of guy buddies, or to snuggle up to with your girl. I'd've given it 5 stars if the girl had been hotter. she looked like a ... porn star, though, so i had to take off 2 stars from this C-Movie. enjoy!
0790736314|5.0|&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is my number one movie. It earned many awards and was a real shocker in the cinema when it first came on the big screen. It is also the highest grossing horror film ever made.<br />The acting and storyline are superb. (As it was based on William Peter Blatty's horror novel.) The effects of the film are outstanding for the time. Such as the dubbing of Linda Blair's voice. (Which was the voice of Mercades McCambridge) which in many ways is stylish and most probably new back in the 1970's. The exorcism itself is brillant with two very, very convincing priests. Which are Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) and Father Karras (Jason Miller). They give off a brillant performance.<br />Overall in many ways this movie is a timeless classic and could well live on forever... As the the film that was banned for 25 years!

B000002G87|3.0|There is no question in my mind that this is one of the most inspired moments in Clapton's career. One of the greatest rock albums ever, it is the one against which all others are measured. This contains all the turmoil and angst that epitomizes the man's life and this particular period in history. It is no less than a masterpiece by a musician at the top of his form. Unfortunately, this edition fails to measure up to the previous 20th anniversary edition. Somebody tampered with it and the result is less than perfect. I bought and played the &quot;Remastered&quot; edition side-by-side with the 20th anniversary edition copy and in my opinion the earlier one is better. I've kept it. I'm afraid this is a case of a record company executive decision that should never have been made.
B000002KY8|5.0|\\"1999\\" is the second masterpiece from Prince (the first, of course, being \\"Dirty Mind\\").  Already an r&b presence with modest hits such as \\"I Wanna Be Your Lover\\" and \\"Controversy,\\" this album is the first release to introduce him to the mainstream audience.  Originally a double-album, it's now available as a single CD, and it still rocks just as hard as it did back in 1982.  Prince serves up rock, funk, soul, and Lord knows what else on this musically diverse album.  I can't begin to tell you how many times the song \\"1999\\" has been misinterpreted as an upbeat New Year's Eve anthem.  If you read the lyrics (few apparently do), you'll find that this is a song that's about the end of the world!  But no matter.  \\"Little Red Corvette\\" is a classic single that may be his best, a fine weave of aggressive rock with Minneapolis funk.  There's also the naughty \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\" that still has the juice to raise-eyebrows with its risque lyrics, and the song \\"Automatic\\" has lost none of its luster.  But the song that I find personally funny is the sensual \\"International Lover,\\" where Prince comapres sex to an air flight and moans at the end, \\"Welcome to satisfaction.\\"  \\"1999\\" is a marvelous display of the talents of Prince, who wrote, produced, and arranged every note.  If you haven't heard a note of this album, then chances are you are living in a cave.  A must-have for those who are starting a collection of Prince releases.
B0000524CY|4.0|I'm not even fifteen and I wasn't scared of this film. Yes, it is very good, but it is way more disturbing thn scary. It is still a good movie. Don't let me drive you away from it. I think The Shining (Jack Nicholson) which was made in the 70's too was a lot frightening the first time (maybe it was because I was younger and saw that first). Anyway, this is a great film. If you like odd movies, this is the one for you.

Real emotion, real musical idea development, real imagination, and really being moved am I by this 3rd release by Master Oldfield!<br />I put this album on and I am transported to midnight moors, soft spring hills, elegant mansions that dissolve into swirling stars that dissolve into mad passionate dancing by the firelight in the middle of the desert...the transcendant sounds tickle and trickle and then break my heart with their beauty and then build up and into my heart with their spiritual strength until I ask myself, or anyone, &quot;Is this what music would sound like if made by the Divine?&quot;<br />I don't mean to sound trite in my praise for this recording, but when something reaches into you and grabs you by the loins and makes full love to your ears and Soul at the same time, believe me, you take notice. Please buy this music if you want to feel the magic again...it does exist beyond these gates...
B00005YUAC|4.0|In the dark ages of vinyl, after much hunting, I had found a copy of the first Camel album.  Although the quality of sound was woeful, I still dug the tight rhythms.  My favorite pieces were, of course \\"Slow Youself Down\\" and \\"Never Let Go\\".  Now I have finally found this rarely released album on compact disc and must say that I'm pretty gratified.   The quality of remastering is nothing short of revelatory; Camel had much more substance to them then their brilliant follow up album Mirage had let on.<BR>     This is of course a progressive rock album, and it's progressive in every way.  Both rhythm and melody circle each other like duelling snakes.  Within these circles you can hear snatches of jazz and the occasional snippet of a blues riff.  The best examples are the instrumental, \\"Six Ate\\" as well as \\"Curiousity\\".  The album closes with the fine heavy meltdown of \\"Arubaluba\\".<BR>     Of the bonus tracks, my CD didn't include the single edit of Curiosity.  Never Let Go, strangely enough, sounds somewhat murkier that the album version.  All will be forgiven, however, when you listen to Homage To The God of Light, which has captured Camel in heavy jam mode.  In all, the debut album by Camel is one of the great overlooked gems of progressive rock, that has been overshadowed by the more commercially successful albums of Mirage and Snowgoose that came after.  This was a band that hit the ground running and kept going for 30 more years.
B000056K04|3.0|This album is what happens when you take an enormous talent like Dave Matthews and micromanage him with record executive &quot;convential wisdom&quot; on how to make records sell.<br />It's not a bad album, exactly, but it doesn't have the power that other DMB compositions do.  It's just trying to take a decidedly non-single artist and force him to make singles.<br />You'd be much better off skipping this album and picking up the one that the record company initially didn't release - _Busted Stuff_ - which is much closer to the DMB I learned to love.
0380820846|4.0|I really liked this book, with all of Quinn's humorous writing style, witty dialogue and sparkling characters.  The fact that both characters are judged by outward appearances and only when they begin to look inside the person do they begin to fall in love, makes for a really likeable romance.  The Lady Whistledown plot does get wearisome, but that's only minor details.  Don't let it ursurp the fact that the romance is realistic, beautiful and will endear you to both characters.
B000066NW0|2.0|Avril Lavigne has a great voice. It was that combined with the radio version of Complicated that got me to buy this album, and God do I wish I had bought the single. Her friends on the instruments are basically terrible. The songs themselves make it well known that Avril idealizes Alanis (and I actually like Alanis quite a bit) since she constantly tries to sing in Alanis's style. The band and the style are a big mistake, hunny. Get some good musicians and sing your own way cause your voice is awesome. as far as the lyrics go, are you all fourteen? I can't believe how so many of you who reviewed this album said you could identify with her songs. I'll admit I like Complicated, but even with that song, only the radio remix (which improves on the instrumental ten fold) is worth listening to. When she looses the band and grows up a little she'll be awesome, but this album sucks. If you want to hear Complicated buy the single cause this album will only disappoint.
0790729628|5.0|The definitive version of Ridley Scott's sci fi classic ditches the voice-over narration and sappy ending, and it all culminates in a more satisfying watch. Released in 1982, BLADE RUNNER sunk at the box office, and who knows what to attribute it's commercial failure to, perhaps it was the material that's now been taken out? Regardless, it's a deserved sci fi classic that has stood the test of time to become one of the greats. From the huge sucess of ALIEN, Scott's third film as director is perhaps not as clever as it tries to be, but is nontheless an entertaining thrill ride with some terrific action set-pieces.  Hugely influential on films like THE FIFTH ELEMENT, A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and STAR WARS EPISODE II, Scott's vision of a neon-soaked Los Angeles is one of the many astounding and unforgettable images throughout the film. Harrison Ford is in superb form as the man sent to bring in a replicant cyborg. The cinematography is breath-taking, the special effects are great and Vangelis' original score is excellent. With so many good points it's hard to name them all, Blade Runner is a true classic.
B000000W5N|5.0|This release early in the 1970s by the Rolling Stones marked a turning point for them, establishing them as the premier rock and roll band with the break-up of the Beatles, and with the resurgence of the Stones popularity behind the raucous lyrics and pulsating music of \\"Sticky Fingers\\". Always the naughty boys of rock, Mick Jagger and Keith Richard ensured their continuing place on the pantheon of rock immortals with this entry. From the opening \\"Brown Sugar\\" to the deceptively simple and quite innovative \\"Wild Horses\\", they return the audience back to the elemental basic of popular rock, and do so with a verve and energy hard to understand in a band that had already been around for a decade.<br />All of it is good stuff, but the way it is glued together is with the basic drum and guitar work. Jagger's lyrics are always quizzical and rough, but here they provide the perfect accompaniment for the driving rock sounds comes flowing across the sound system as naturally as anything they have ever recorded. Ah, but is it derivative?  Absolutely, but brilliantly so, a innovative recapitulation of everything they had done up to that point, a kind of revived rock resume, saying it was time to get on with it. And they do so superbly here. The Stones are not the world's best rock musicians, but Richard at his best is a stunningly good craftsman, as are Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman. Mick flits around the edges with his provocative vocal style, and it all adds up here. This is one of their best. Enjoy!

I would read this book to Toddlers who are four to five years old. It's shows a whole life cycle and is well written. So every mom has to bond with their baby.  Every one will be stuck in the same situation. This book reminds me of my dads' father who died in Mexico.  Every time, I watch the video of my dads Father's funeral, I feel bad seeing my dad really sad and really pale from not eating. Everyone is going to experience life and death at some time in their life. But anyways, this book is a really nice book and I will recommend everyone to read it. And it's also a good ending sentence. \\"If you love to Read\\" read, the book: I LOVE YOU FOR EVER!
0385503954|5.0|I started this book a little reluctantly, on the recommendation of a friend. It was hard to read. The novel starts slowly, and the style took some getting used to. The story itself is also dark and painful. I found myself wanting to look away from the pages rather than continue toward the horrifying events that were taking shape.<br />I was getting close to putting the book down, and giving up on it altogether, when I got to the second half of the novel. Wow -- I was absolutely hooked, couldn't stop reading, and by the end felt absolutely enraptured, enthralled, and uplifted. I didn't want to read anything else for awhile, but instead reflected on this novel for several days afterward.<br />In my opinion, this is one of the best books I've read in years. I gave a copy to my mother, and she told me she's having a hard time getting through the first few chapters. &quot;Keep reading&quot; I told her. &quot;It's worth it.
079073639X|3.0|Barry Levinson's sci fi thriller is a taut, suspensful film which underservedly got bad reviews when it was released. Sure, it has it's flaws, but the story (taken from Micheal Chricton's novel) is thought-provoking and provides for some seriously spooky moments, and like THE ABYSS, the claustraphobic feel racks up the tension. The star power of Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L. Jackson give the film gravitas, and Sharon Stone has one of her best roles here. CGI creations and downright freaky sea creatures are great. For the most part, the story consists of a series of extraordinary events, that, while fascinating, create an anti-climax at the end, which is somewhat dissapointing. It does have it's moments of suspense, if only the ending had worked to a fuller effect, then this would be a great film, instead of just a good one.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|It is clear from a viewing of this very good film what Hollywood found so intriguing and so fascinating about the life of Nobel laureate John Nash. It is indeed a life that was distinguished by a raging plethora of contradictory qualities and experiences, and one in which much was suffered and yet much gained. Thus it was by virtue of the very range of these seemingly irreconcilable aspects to his complicated, convoluted, and extremely troubled existence that his story was deemed to be so irresistible that they gave it the \\"whole Hollywood treatment\\".  In a phrase, then, in the movie industry's judgment Doctor Nash was notably nuts, and was a distinguished Noble Prize-winning nutcase at that. And, oh, how Hollywood loves to romanticize such accomplished, misunderstood and unlikable miscreants.<br />That much said, the acting was quite good, and the director truly was inspired, and deserved an Oscar for his work. For he does deliver an immensely entertaining and enormously interesting piece of work here, however badly it may misrepresent the true and authentic set of situations it is portending to recreate. Using a barrelful of creative license, Ron Howard deep sixes the accuracy of the events to weave a lovely period piece about love, intellect, and madness. So too, Russell Crowe's acting delivers a powerful testimony to the agony of his afflictions, yet it too is so stylized and so pushed along by special effects that somehow we wind up feeling almost envious of the protagonist's beautiful hallucinations of a world far more singularly novel, photogenic and breath-taking than the one the majority of us seem to inhabit day in and day out.<br />Jennifer Connelly is stunning and lovely, and her victory at winning the Academy Award speaks volumes for how little is expected of actresses in some dramatic roles. So, while I liked the movie for what it was, I was disappointed to find it such a sugary and sentimental representation of the events as they actually transpired. The story was often uneven and disjointed, so while my interest was maintained, I would be less than candid if I didn't say that I thought it a bit too long and at points a bit belabored.  A good movie, but in my humble estimation  hardly a great movie. Glad to see Ron Howard win the Oscar, but did not think this was the best he has ever done. Enjoy!.

0920668372|5.0|The book, Love You Forever, by Robert Munch, is a good book for a special time.  For example, if someone is very ill and not going to be with us for very long.  The book shows that no matter how old your child gets, or how bad he or she is, you will always love them with all of your heart.  Love You Forever represents true love and strong, caring emotions for other people.  The book may not be good to read to children within the grades of kindergarten through second grade.  It may not be a good idea because the children may have visions or thoughts of their own mother passing away.  But, I would definitely buy this book and read it to my son when he gets old enough to understand the concept of the book.
B00000JSJC|2.0|I wanted to like this.  Really, I did.  I worship both Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett.  But this just turned out to be another dark, muddled virtual-reality fantasy.<br />Film noir is one thing, but this was just too damned dark.  I'm sorry that technology has gotten to the point where directors feel that they can shoot dark scenes without additional lighting, because they abuse it.  I spent most of this movie wishing that I had a pair of US Army-issue night goggles, just so that I could follow the action.  Because, honey, I could barely see half of the movie.<br />This film had nothing novel to say about virtual-reality; in that respect, it was just a warmed-over version of \\"Total Recall\\" and a half-dozen others of that time.<br />Another reviewer noted the fact that this \\"futuristic\\" movie, which was made in 1995, made no mention of the concept of the Internet.  That's the problem with these \\"a few years in the future\\" type movies - by the time they actually come out, they're out-of-date, and within a few years they're almost quaint in their datedness.<br />The only thing that made it worth watching was the kiss at the end.
0345409671|5.0|OMG is what I said when I finished this book. Anyone that has read it knows exactly what I mean. This book has the same atmosphere as all of the rest of Anne Rice's books, but there is something significantly different in this. <br />Lestat de Lioncourt, the hero of almost all of Rice's books, has come upon a brand new being, one like nothing that anyone has ever come upon, and with this being is an offer. This being is Memnoch, the Devil. Yes, the Devil. As in Lucifer, Satan, Mephistopheles, Azazel, all of them. Memnoch takes him to heaven, through time, and then to hell. This story runs in a way that captured my interest immediately and all the way through. <br />Anyone who even thinks that they are an Anne Rice fan must pick up this book and read why she is acclaimed one of the greatest writers of the century!!
B000002LFZ|5.0|Although they recapitulated and brilliantly reinterpreted a lot of the material in here with their marvelous CD, \\"The Dance\\" a few years ago, the versions included in this offering are the original studio versions that were both on the original albums and all over the wavelengths of popular FM radio in the seventies and eighties. From the innovative treatment in the opening number of Rhiannon\\" to the final refrains of \\"No Questions Asked\\", this CD treats the listener to all their favorite Fleetwood Mac songs. And all them are indeed here.<br />Included are \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Hold Me\\", and \\"Everywhere\\". Of course, no greatest hits album would be complete without \\"Gypsy\\", \\"You Make Loving Fun\\", and \\"Dreams\\". Also here is \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Tusk\\", \\"Sara\\", and \\"Over My Head\\". There are few other songs included, so you have well over an hour of exceptional music from one of the most wildly successful rock bands of the last twenty years. This should keep you busy remembering just how good Lindsay Buckingham, Mick Fleetwood, the MacVies, and of course, Stevie Nicks were. Who knows, perhaps there will be another reunion! Meanwhile, enjoy this collection of their greatest hits!
B000067CQK|5.0|I like the packaging (as well as the idea of presenting the album in its original form and placing bonus tracks on a second disc) but the main reason I'd recommend this version is that the remastering job sounds incredible.  This new one blows the Ryko gold disc away, and compares favorably with the rich, detailed sound of the long-deleted Mobile Fidelity LP.
B000065U1N|5.0|Don't forget what those skinies did to us!  We should go back and finish the job.  This movie was one of the most accurate war movies ever made!  Depicts what happened and tells the story.  But one thing left out in the end is that Muhamed Farrah Aidid's son who was one of the U.S. Marines sent to restore order, returned to take his fathers place when he dies.  This was one of the best movies made.

B000000ORX|5.0|Joni Mitchell re-ignited her flagging career with this substantial and sumptuous song cycle released in 1991. From the title tune of \\"Night Ride Home to her eclectic interpretation of Yeat's poem \\" The Second Coming\\" set to music as \\"Slouching Toward Bethlehem\\", Joni is in fine voice and artistic temperament. \\"Night Ride Home is sensual and evocative, a poetic word picture set lovingly to music, a statement about the current state of her life, her yearnings, and her place in the greater scheme of things.<br /> The next song, called \\"Passion Play\\", is an intriguingly stated broadside on contemporary politics and the nature of modern culture. Of course, her popular songwriting sensibilities cannot be denied, and her sweet confection with \\"Come In From The Cold\\" is exception, and is clearly autobiographical. Those of us old enough to remember of what she speaks can marvel at her ability to write such lovely word pictures, and to then compose a suitable melodic arrangement to encase it in.<br />All of this is done with great verve and enthusiasm, and everything included here seems to cohere into the musical statement she is making. Of course, Joni is nothing if not surprising, and yet it is truly amazing that someone with so many prior efforts behind is still so capable of such elemental and progressive work. Joni retreats for years into her artistic cocoon, painting and pursuing other interests, only to suddenly merge onto stage center with a whole raft of fresh, original and quite accomplished new works to stun us with. This wonderful album is no exception. Enjoy!

B000065U1N|5.0|This isn't a movie to show the children, and isn't a movie that one would throw in the player for a quick mindless romp.<BR>This movie is more along the lines of a Saving Private Ryan.  But unlike Ryan, the horror doesn't end after 15 minutes.  It's a gut-wrenching view of warfare.  It doesn't pull the punches of John Wayne classics, or have the nobility of the old black and white war films.  It's brutal and horrible.<BR>The characters are not developed, because their past does not matter.  Their motivations, outside that of living and protecting their buddies, do not matter.  All that matters is what they did during 16 hours of hell worse than most of us can imagine, and few of us would want to experience.  It doesn't matter what 1 man did, but what they did as Rangers and as Deltas.  It will take several watchings before a person can track particular characters paths (and wonder why Ewan McGregor is the RPG magnet of all time).<BR>If one would like to watch a movie about unconventional heroism, this is the movie though, even Hollywoodized as it is.  It serves as an incredible reminder of the sacrifices men make for each other.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is great. The acting is excellent and the storyline is great. This is the tale of a Roman general and his life after ceaser is killed. He is taken from riches to rags and forced to survive the impossible. The cinimotography is impecable
B00000DGUY|5.0|I remember hearing the first Dire Straits album while living in London in the early 1980s, and I was astounded by the singular sounds emanating coming from Mark Knopfler's guitar. The album I heard was \\"Love Over Gold\\", and after buying it and listening to all the songs within it, I sailed back out to buy everything else they already had recorded. Overnight I became a confirmed Dire Straits fan. And the distinctive style they promulgated and popularized in both British rock and on the world-wide stage guaranteed their lasting contribution to modern rock. Of course, they didn't survive the eighties as an entity, although Knopfler himself has gone on to become an accomplished scorer for movies and other musical venues.<br />What remains, however, is singularly terrific,  for no one can match that distinctive twangy purr Knopfler sent spinning down our spines. From the opening rendition of \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" to the unusual and provocative \\"Romeo And Juliet', this is a great collection. It includes &quot;Tunnel Of Love\\", the live version of \\"Love Over Gold\\", an incredible version of \\"Private Investigations\\", culled form the \\"Communiqu&eacute;\\" album, and \\"So Far Away'. Also here are \\"Money For Nothing\\", \\"Brothers In Arms\\", and \\"Walk Of Life'. Homage is paid here to Knopfler's early scoring career, with the \\"Local Hero\\" theme included. All in all, this is a terrific compilation of the best of Dire Straits. Enjoy!
B00005YW4H|4.0|There are many muisic artists now that are only concerned with money, videos, money, promtion, big venues, money, looking good and did I mention money. They loose sight of whats really important; Staying true to yourself and making music from the hearts. Finally, an artist comes along who displays this and so much more.<br />    If anyone has read Norah's feature in Rolling Stone, then you already know that this young talented beauty has only one goal on her mind, to make good music. Done with so much novelty which seems like years of experience, Norah created &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; for those who just want to relax. <br />     First her voice. Well, it holds not power and she wont be holding any 20 second notes either, but its classic and its tie to her music makes it something to look out for. The entire album seems so classic that at a first listen you'll believe you bought something by Sara or Patsy, but it'll sound so good.<br />       The first single and first track, &quot;Dont Know Why&quot;, has that slow jazzy piano that will begin to slow you down, and make you feel at one. After that, the album begins to flow into a more calm state, while Norah easily moves over her lyrics with an occasional minute of piano keys. Dont expect to hear a song or two that will be played forever on every pop station, instead prepare yourself for music straight from the heart. I really cant describe the songs since they are so slow and peaceful, but I can gurantee that you wont be disappointed after listening to this record.
B00005JKED|3.0|This movie I only gave three stars because the climax seemed to be thrown togather. the begining of the movie is spectacular. They develop the characters well and the forshadowing is excellent. But when it comes to the ending, i have to say, the ending was weak. It was a good idea, but it was poorly written.
B0000636UN|1.0|only one good song on this whole cd, dont waste your time with this one, sorry sheryl but u need some betta songs on it...
B00003W8NM|5.0|this movie is an experience of its own, and it is probably one of the only movies that literally changes the way you think about things. even if not enjoyed by the viewer, it still opens a lot of things up to his or her mind. with one of the best scores of all time by the dust brothers, and such a dark, sarcastic and scary yet genius attitude, this movie could not have been better.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Like many others, I was amazed by Aronofsky's debut, &quot;Pi&quot;, and had heard much about about this highly-revered film before finally checking it out. <BR>We all know the story by now...starting with the characters dabbling in substances with good (naive) intentions, starting to lose control, and finally being pulled down the spiral and losing much more than they initially thought they ever would. <BR>Going into this being the jaded film obsessive I'd like to consider myself, the movie actually did grab me and hold my attention from the start. Most of the camera tricks, although a bit MTV-ish as the director himself alludes to, are really interesting and are in fact grounded within the confines of the storyline. The ritual of ingestion gets very repetitive, but that's the point. <BR>A few things did bother me.. Some of the execution of the story and the camera-work seemed a bit cute... in a way, &quot;Pi&quot; seems to be more developed as far as distinctive atmosphere then RFAD. This is a minor complaint though, because as I said, the plot does keep one's attention. And all traces of cuteness are forgotten as the inescapable consequences of the characters' actions take on more and more gravity. The pacing is very well done. The downward slope goes from slight to sharp very quickly, leading to a frenzied jump-edit climax where everything forms a tornado of despair, and the viewer is left thinking, &quot;Something like this would never happen&quot;, but it would, and it does. <BR>As far as emotional resonance with the characters, the most harrowing to watch would more than likely be Sara Goldbaum (as seems to be the almost unanimous opinion). The younger characters at least have some idea of what they're getting themselves into, but Sara starts out so innocent with her foray into pills (with the mindset that the doctor gave them to her..what could the harm be?). She then ends up addicted, with her mind deteriorating until she's only a shell...housing a jumbledmess of disconnected scattered thoughts and perceptions. The others don't end up in positions any better, for the record, and human fallability and frailty has seldom been better documented. <BR>The power this film has is that it causes one to mull over their own decisions and consider whether they've been wise... Life can be beautiful, but it's all too easy to destroy it, no matter how invincible we think we are. <BR>Hopefully we'll all see this before it's too late.
0679722610|5.0|The Continental Op is, as far as I'm concerned, the most interesting of Dashell Hammett's characters.  He's a middle aged fat man employed by a national detective agency similar to Pinkerton (which Hammett worked for before turning to writing).  As such, he's nominally bound to rules which he generally follows, but breaks in this particular case.<br />His client is murdered before he meets him, and hired by the client's father to find the murderer, finds himself in a totally corrupt community basically run by the mob.  Though he easily finds the murderer, he stays on in the father's hire to clean up the town, spurred on by the actions of one of the corrupt law authorities.  <br />The story is engrossing, and the implications are even more so.  The corruption is so deep that it affects even the main character.  The theme common to most Contintinental Op stories is here:  Everybody lies and the only way to get at the truth is to create your own lie.  <br />Every tough crime story needs its love interest, and this one is very believable in that you can see why she is drawn to this middle aged fat man and why he can find her acceptable.  You also realize why he's withholding his feelings both from himself and from the reader.<br />While not Hammett's most read novel, it's definitely expertly crafted and one quite rewarding to read.
B000000WA4|5.0|everything from the artwork to the lyrics on this cd are perfect. next to Talib Kweli &amp; DJ Hi tek's Reflection Eternal, i believe this is one of the greatest pieces of art out there. the smashing pumpkins are a beautiful group, and this album is just one of their amazing pieces. <BR>DISC 1: 1-7, 7 is my personal favorite on the disc,10,13,14<BR>DISC 2: 2-5, 7,8 is my personal favorite on this disc,11-14<BR>the other songs are great too just these stand out more.

B00003CX5A|5.0|Tim Burton is and always will be an awesome director. as far as this movie goes, the atmosphere of the movie is so incredibly decorated and detailed that the movie, even though could be described as a horror/slasher film, is beautiful. there is comic relief in the film as well, and its intelligent in the way that like another reviewer stated before, there are very limited jokes in the film, just the way that expressions are displayed happen to be entertaining. this movie is a great movie, especially around the fall. Watch this movie.
B0000640VN|5.0|An absolutely charming romantic comedy about a love destined to span time.  Duke Leopold of Albany (Hugh Jackman) is accidentally swept from 1876 to present-day 2001 where he finds love in a NOW kind of woman (Kate),  aptly portrayed by Meg Ryan. The time travel is nothing more than a means to an end and fortunately does not dominate the movie.  The style of this flick harkens back to movies of old and is suitable for family viewing.  The movie shows the value and allure of true romance as opposed to lust, and chivalry as opposed to expedience.  This is a witty look at what love has lost through the ages and what it can still be if we only take the time.  The story is delivered with a good dose of humor, too.  Jackman is thoroughly convincing as the Duke and humorously confronts the difficulties of modern life in NYC.  The charm of this movie is that it reveals the value of sincerity, good manners, and taste without taking itself too seriously.  Leopold shows us what we seem to have lost in modern times and why we should value love over a marriage for the sake of financial security or advancing one's career. Finally, Sting's classical guitar ballad  \\"Until\\" which concludes the movie credits is beautiful and will stay with you... stuck in your head, until you watch the movie again.
B00005QIPH|4.0|if you just happen to be having a good day this cd is the cd to listen to. its not perfect, it's kind of bland but it has a nice feel to it thats kind of fun and makes you feel good. listen to the cd first before purchasing.
0316776963|5.0|This book is a terrifically funny collection of stories.  David Sedaris is an amazing writer.  I can't wait for another book.
B000063K62|4.0|Well, I didn't bother wading through all 126 reviews, but I read a good many of them, and it seems to me that people fall into one of two camps: either they hate &quot;Waking Life&quot;  because it's pretentious, or they love it because it's thought provoking.  I think there's something to be said for each of these views.  There is a whole lot of philosophizing going on here - some of it is profound, and some of it is BS - just like life.  And, also like life, it's up to YOU to decide which is which!  I wouldn't assume that any of what comes out of the characters' mouths are Linklater's pet ideas - characters are characters, and the filmaker may or may not agree with what they are saying.  As for the animation, I thought it was pretty cool.  It's a real mixed bag though - you might like some segments and not like others.  But I'm kind of surprised that anyone would find it boring - I would never say that.  &quot;Waking Life&quot; is a fun movie.
B00005NTNM|5.0|This one and Sudden Impact has the best Dirty Harry one-liners in them. Dirty Harry takes the law in his own hands, doesn't care what anyone in his department thinks. He knows what it takes to fight crime, and the rest of the department doesn't. A Dirty Harry Classic!

0312265859|3.0|When Evelyn Soder disappears with her daughter, it means big trouble for her mother, Mabel Markowitz.  The judge in Evelyn's divorce insisted on a child custody bond and Evelyn's ex-husband is intent on collecting it.  Mabel co-signed for the bond, and now she may lose her home.  Stephanie Plum, unlucky in love and fugitive apprehension, becomes involved because Mabel is her parents' neighbor.  Mabel bakes when she is upset, and the Plums are drowning in bread loaves and coffee cakes.<br />And so, begins yet another comic adventure in the strange world of 'The Burg,' Trenton's own twilight zone.  Soon she finds herself in conflict with Eddie Abruzzi, who is a sociopathic crime lord when he isn't being a sociopathic war gamer.  Eddie wants Stephanie out of the Soder investigation, and is perfectly willing to make her crazy before he finally kills her.  In addition, Stephanie must deal with Andy Bender, a bond-skipping drunk with a talent for getting Plum to trip over her own feed.<br />Nor should I fail to mention a lawyer whose name is not spelled c-l-o-w-n, a female apprehension agent who is almost as good as Ranger (and who doesn't keep losing cars, purses and handcuffs), and that usual mad gang of crooks, cohorts and lovers.  Yes, Stephanie's love life becomes even more complicated while everything else is going on.  Without TastyCakes and pizza, Plum would be well on the way to a nervous breakdown.<br />This all is typical Evanovich.  In fact, it is a bit too typical.  Very few writers are able to avoid formula writing when a series begins to stretch out into extra innings, and 'Hard Eight' has started to show the inevitable signs of strain.  As a plot, it is very reminiscent of 'High Five.'  But while that was fun and original, this time the sight gags and sarcasm are beginning to wear thin.  Evanovich's solution seems to be to have the same things happen, but even more often.  This time Stephanie loses enough cars and handcuffs to stock a small police department.<br />The single thing that bother's me most is the degeneration of Stephanie's character.  Not all that long ago, she was a feisty woman who was down on her luck but determined to make things come out right.  The humor was clever and she often gave as good as she got.  Now she is a near incompetent who spends to much time being a victim of her own poor choices.  The humor has shifted to slapstick and too often Stephanie is the joke.  And she has started to rely on anyone but herself when problems occur.  Often this is funny, but I keep finding myself wincing rather than laughing.  I want the old Stephanie back.ment.  <br />The single thing that bother's me most is the degeneration of Stephanie's character.

B00003CXI1|5.0|People love to tell how the book was always \\"so much better than the movie!\\"  I don't really think it matters how good the book or the movie are, people are just so afraid to say they enjoyed any movie more.  Well, I enjoyed this movie more than the book.  This is probably because I saw the movie first, which means that when I think on all those feelings of excitement and worry, I remember the movie.  <br />For the purists, who love to pick apart any difference between the movie and the book (and judge the movie's version to be worse, regardless of whether it is), there are plenty of little changes to keep them occupied (and give them hours upon hours whiney conversation topics).  But, for those of you who love a great story, you will not be disappointed. <br />This is an excellent movie with all the important moments from the book nicely bound in to a 2+ hour movie.  It is so well done that if you see it before you read the book, you may like it more, too.<br />Don't bother renting, it's just wasting 3 bucks (You'll end up buying it anyway).
B00004YRQA|5.0|I use this memory card all the time for my PS2 games.  I have to say, as a first-timer PlayStation owner, this memory card is the best.  It allows you to store as many games as you can imagine - 8 MB is a lot of space.  You can also view, delete, and manage your saved files on the PS2.  Without this memory card, I wouldn't be able to play my games.  It's definitely 100% worth the money.
0316666343|5.0|..and I read it in a day (9 hours), only stopping once, to eat.  As a mother of a son and daughter, one of whom is a teenager--and not to get too mystical, here-- I was reluctant to go on the journey I knew this book would take me.  At the risk of sounding schmaltzy, I must say that from the beginning I felt gently guided by Susie, the narrator of the story.  She, and her story, and her family's story, took me by the hand, gently reeled me in, quietly assuring me that not only would I be brave enough to read this book, but that I would be glad I had in the end. I love every moment of this book.  It is exquisite.  And I am very picky.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe goes over and above any performance of his to date.  Ron Howard directs what most certainly is his best movie to date.  This real-life story of a genius who lived in two worlds, his own, and the real world.  This story is very interesting because it throws you for a loop, kind of in the same genre of the sixth-sense.  Any more information would really ruin the movie for those who have not seen it.  This movie does not dissapoint, and deserves the awards it has already won.  In an era of low-rent movie making, this movie stands high in every aspect.
0060934913|3.0|An autobiographical account of Bourdain's continuing and chosen profession, Kitchen Confidential would mean absolutely nothing to anyone without a strong interest in food, the food trade or for that matter, life in 1970s and 1980s New York.  I've eaten in many restaurants and I will now ask myself if the team visible behind the counter or windowed doors is largely made up of strung out, dope head pasta cooks, pastry artisans with no fixed address or bread makers with constant run ins with the law.  Frankly, some of Bourdain's material is hard to swallow, so to speak.  Still, Kitchen Confidential is engaging reading and a departure from anything this reviewer (and food lover) has read before.  I would suggest matching it with a nice merlot.
B000067CPX|4.0|Not a BAD thing, but RHCP shows little progress from the amazing &quot;Californication,&quot; which found them quantum-leaping from previous work and earmarked them, finally, as a band that is going to mature and is going be with us for a while.  If you liked &quot;Californication,&quot; you'll probably like this one.
0380977788|4.0|oh, and everyone else too :)<br />I must say that I went into this book expecting way too much. Neil Gaiman is a great writer, and on the strength of his other works I picked this one up with HIGH expectations. But, don't get me wrong it is a good little book, and one I would have loved to have read as a child. It will not, though, by any standards, dethrone Alice in Wonderland. However, I do recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes to read, and I think any child would be thrilled to read Coraline.<br /> The world of Coraline is wonderful and mysterious. The characters are intriguing and the cat is simply splendid, but the plot is a little thin and predictable. I know that it is a children's book and therefore should not be held to highly strenuous standards of plot development, but if it is to be compared to Alice then it needs to be able to stand on the same pedestal.<br />When I first reviewed this book I felt it deserved a 3 star rating: a good book, one worth spending your time on, but not great.  But, the more I thought about it, the more the book stayed with me.  The world in which Coraline enters and the characters she meets are fascinating and the story is good, so, on those merits, I decided to change my 3 star rating to a 4. <br />Caroline, I mean Coraline, is a nice book that anyone should enjoy reading, so pick it up and give it a read. Just don't let her take your soul in the process...
B000065U1N|4.0|Blackhawk Down is a truly jarring film, more jarring than other contenders in the field, Saving Private Ryan, and Enemy at the Gates.  I kept thinking as I watched this movie how all our good intentions and high technology could not prevent this disaster from happening.  This film shook me in that regard; Ridley Scott depicts a fast, hopeless battle against a foe armed less with high-tech weapons than hate and courage.<br />Mark Bowden's excellent book makes a good transition, but the necessary filmic needs of recognizable characters leaves us with little to hang on to; too many faces look alike, talk alike. Die alike. Some reviewers have called this war pornography, but there is too much pain, at least for me, to enjoy the violence.  This is not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  If this were War Porn, Ridley Scott would have shown the massive numbers of Somali dead and hideously wounded our forces caused.  The kill ratio was at least 10 to 1 or higher.<br />This film also made me ask questions so I ended up reading the book, thus learning more than I intended. For me, at least, this makes Blackhawk Down worth seeing.<br />By the way, this is a landmark historical film: For the first time actual videotapes of a battle in progress were availible for the filmmakers to use, creating a record of words and wounds, unlike say Saving Private Ryan, which is an unlikely concoction of wishful thinking and cgi.
B000005H3A|5.0|With the personnel on this recording I can't imagine it not satisfying the needs of any jazz listener.  <BR>\\"Takin' Off\\" makes a big addition to a well-seasoned jazz collection or a great starting-point for those just starting off.<br />The natural sound of the horns and the rhythm section together makes this one of my favorite acoustic jazz albums of all time.  Freddie Hubbard is nothing short of perfect.  His clean sound and virtuosity blend perfectly with Dexter Gordon, Herbie, and the rest of the gang.<br />I highly recommend \\"Takin' Off\\" for anyone.  It is accessible to those who may have limited interest in jazz yet complex enough to keep jazz enthusiasts engaged.
B0000508U6|5.0|This is a really good cd!  I can listen to the whole thing without skipping any of the tracks.  My favorite songs are &quot;Yellow&quot; and &quot;Sparks&quot; but all of the songs are good.  I recommend that you buy this cd.  I am looking forward to Coldplay's next album!
0780020685|3.0|For a film with such a hefty price tag, I would expect the english subtitles to at least be accurate...there are instances, such as when the word &quot;become&quot; is confused with &quot;because,&quot; that simply make no sense.  <br />Aside from that (again keeping in mind the massive price tag Criterion has assigned to this disc), there are plenty of scratches and weird black spots scattered throughout the print.  They cleaned up some of it, but apparently ran out of patience (I don't see how they could have run out of money!).  <br />I give 5 stars to Akira Kurosawa, but loud jeers for the greedy crooks at Criterion.
B00005B36H|5.0|The long wait for Tool to come out with new material was well worth Lateralus' subtle, yet emotionally charged music.  Indeed, in many respects, it is difficult to imagine that the same band that produced Aenima, Salival, and Undertow could be capable of Lateralus, which defies description.  I've been a Tool fan long before Lateralus was released, and I still love to rock out to the earlier albums, but Lateralus has a different effect - brooding, meditative, it taps into streams of emotion without having to flush them out in typical nu-metal style.  The thought-provoking lyrics of &quot;Schism,&quot; the emptiness and longing of &quot;The Patient,&quot; and the spirituality of &quot;Lateralus&quot; alone make this album worth the money.  But these are just the beginning.  It seems that Tool has reinvented itself as a band.  Same name, but their &quot;game&quot; is on a whole new level.
0783116934|5.0|Unlike other reviewers, I don't believe that \\"Citizen X\\" would have been a major film hit in the USA, had it been released on the big screen instead of HBO.  The tale, gleaned from the true crime novel, \\"The Killer Department\\" by Robert Cullen, translates beautifully to the small screen, and on the small screen, superior actors are given the roles that might have been played with less skill by big screen movie names.  HBO original films live up to their reputation with this tale from 1995 that was just translated to DVD last year.  The special features of the DVD are nothing spectacular, but this true life tale of a serial killer who raged in the Soviet Union for more than eight years is tragic and spellbinding.<br />Director Chris Gerolmo plays the film not for its brutality, but for its tragedy and senselessness. Good investigators are stymied in the search for a monster (who kills mainly children) by the  bureaucracy of the Soviet Union and the unwillingness of the Communist party to come to terms with the fact that this type of horror can exist outside the decadent west.  While they are turning a blind eye, the death count mounts to nearly 50...<br /> Gerolmo is blessed with the chemistry between Donald Sutherland and Stephen Rea.  Sutherland, here an urbane colonel charged with manning the forensics effort needed to find the killer,...<br /> Stephen Rea, best known for \\"The Crying Game\\", but a brilliant actor who chooses non-commercial roles, turns in the performance of his career as Burakov.  His portrayal of the  forensic scientist who, through instinct and determination nearly breaks the case,...<br />  A third brilliant performance is attained by Jeffrey DeMunn, as Chikatilo.  His character was better outlined in the novel, which featured his trial, but DeMunn capitalizes on the portrait of a man who hates himself and his existence...  DeMunn is a fabulous character actor who has spent much of his career in television... and who has recently won acclaim in small roles in quality films (Shawshank, Phenomenon, and as Harry Terwilliger in The Green Mile).  You will feel entirely vindicated by the shocking and brutal way with which the Soviet Union deals with DeMunn's character once the crimes are proven.<br />Citizen X is jarring, unsettling, and bleak in its tale of the evil that men do and the evil that is indifference and apathy.  It has a permanent place on my DVD shelf.in small roles in quality films (Shawshank, Phenomenon, and as Harry Terwilliger in The Green Mile).

630026999X|4.0|This was a good movie.  Something the family can watch because its not real gory.
B000021Y77|5.0|This soundtrack is so good, many other films (and commercials) have taken from it.  It provides a true adrenaline rush, and captures the essence of the film... so if you haven't, see the movie! At least it will give you something to talk about.
B000068QY7|5.0|Boy, what can you say about this CD?  Incredible! Diverse! Exciting!  Every offering Oasis puts forth to us on this CD is outstanding.  From the opening of 'The Hindu Times' to the closing number, which is a song by Liam, 'Better Man', this whole album takes you on a journey from great rock and roll music to the an instrumental number 'A Quick Peep' and to the slow numbers: the acoustic 'Songbird' (another offering by Liam), 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out' and 'She is Love'.  New guitarist Gem Archer get's my vote for having penned the best song on the CD, 'Hung in a Bad Place'.  With a little help wtih great vocals from Liam, this song really rocks.  Liam's third offering is 'Born on a Different Cloud' and is definately influenced by John Lennon.  '(Probably) All in the Mind' is another great song, the guitar work by Gem is incredible, very controlled and smooth, as well as the vocals from Liam, they're dead on.  'Little by Litte' is an excellent song sung by Noel and has a Pink Floyd sound to it in the beginning that builds to a rockin ending.  The other songs Noel sings are also excellent; 'She is Love', 'Songbird', 'Force of Nature'. <br />  In interviews, Noel has said that he has at least 10 more albums in him.  If that is true, the music world had better hold on for a long ride.  With 'Heathen Chemistry', Oasis has left us wanting more..........and we will get it.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I have to admit I didn't like this guy from the minute I saw him in an interview. I think even less of his first single, but I thought I'd check the CD out just out of fascination.<br />I got what I expected.<br />From the beginning, Mayer says he &quot;wants to run through the halls of his high school&quot; again. A twenty-something would have to be insane to want to relive his high-school years, even if it is some sort of &quot;show them all&quot; thing.<br />The next track is a little bit interesting, I'll admit. I can understand what he's dealing with in the song, &quot;I fill my space with wood in places to make it feel like home,&quot; but a lot of the lyrics register as a flat-out desperate attempt to be Dave Mathews(&quot;I'm invincible as long as I'm alive.&quot;) Or perhaps he just couldn't think of a rhyme?<br />&quot;My Big Mouth&quot; is pretty good- a date gone awry because John wouldn't shut up (and now we all know how the girl felt). He stops the song in places saying &quot;I'm never speaking up again&quot; before striking back up and mincing words. Boy, are you &quot;never speaking up again&quot; or should we christen you Chatty Cathy and call it a day? Judging by the mind-boggling length of each song on the 14-track CD, I guess we can assume the latter.<br />The rest of the album is an attempt to be intuitive and sensitive, but actually Mayer is just slapping any thought into badly rhyming sequences. And as the professional reviewer has pointed out, IT WAS JUST A LUNCHBOX, MAN!
B00000IL1K|4.0|I was a bit surprised to find that I like about every cut on this CD.  I say that because I was really not that interested in the &quot;pop&quot; tracks but turns out I like em anyway.<br />Sarah Brightman has a beautiful voice it is unfortunate that it is so far down in the mix.  On many of the songs the vocal is not even close to being as loud as it should be compared to the other tracks in the song and this is very disapointing.<br />However, since I'm a musician I may notice this more then most people will.  I had purchased this CD to hear the vocal and find that I am often frustrated because I can hardly hear the vocal.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was a little leary going into this because I had heard mixed reviews, but this is one of the best albums that I've bought in a long time. It really runs a variety of styles, but every song is one I like. If I had any complaint, it would be that the lyrics are a little simplistic from time to time, but she's only 16 and has brought out one of the most original albums in some time. There is no way not to notice the Alanis influence in her music, but she manages to keep her songs more focused and more listenable than Alanis tends to be. I listen to this album over and over, that's the best recommendation I can give!
068484267X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Angela's Ashes from cover to cover. It truly captures the way the lower-class Irish were forced to live. When there are troubles in the family, you feel as though it is your own family and react as such, as well as with the happy times. It gives you an account from an innocent child's point of view who has to deal with grown-up situations because the money is tight. If you come from and Irish-Catholic background, or even if you don't, I think you would really like this story. Read it!
B000068PQ0|4.0|I must confess that I haven't been able to listen to this album much. Every time I turn it on, I have to play \\"Fight Song\\" over and over and over.. I can't get enough of it. <br />But, from what I've gleaned so far.. there are a few tracks here that are absolutely classic Lips. Fight Song, Yoshimi part 1, and Do You Realize are all excellent. But while the album hangs together fairly well, it isn't nearly as sublimely excellent as The Soft Bulletin, or as fun as Clouds Taste Metallic, or as insane as Hit to Death. Yoshimi resides in its own niche that I can't quite define. All of the songs fall into the same mood, and there's not much variation from that. It sounds rather like \\"Feeling Yourself Disintegrate\\" expanded to full album length. I love that song, so it's not necessarily a bad thing, but the sameness is still a weakness.<br />I realize this isn't much help for a non-Lips fan. To them I must say: Flaming Lips are in their own universe that I beg you to explore.
B00005QEO2|5.0|...\\"Young Lust: The Aerosmith Anthology\\" is a great taste of how far this band has come since the 70s and into a third decade. This is an intricate set, featuring both popular hits and delicious rarities. The first disc is made-up of popular favorites like the powerful \\"Janie's Got A Gun,\\" the fun, lively, orchestra-powered \\"Dude Looks Like A Lady.\\" \\"Hangman Jury\\" is a great rockin' blues tune where Tyler does some fun, sometimes fascinating vocal work. \\"Let The Music Do The Talking\\" is active with some early rock nostalgia. \\"Walk This Way\\" with Run DMC has not aged a bit and still sounds fresh and hip, lots of fun and with style (you kinda wish crap bands like Limp Bizkit would've actually LEARNED from this song how to combine rap with rock). \\"Love In An Elevator\\" is an okay song, depends what kind of day you're having. \\"Young Lust\\" is saucy. Disc 2 has some very interesting tracks and I suspect it is the disc that makes this set worth getting. The opener, \\"Eat The Rich\\" is energetic and lively. The next track is a true Aerosmith gem, a cover of The Doors' \\"Love Me Two Times\\" that really rocks. It's exhilarating, powered by some great playing (especially guitarist Joe Perry's take on Robby Krieger's immortal blues riff) and stunning vocals by Tyler who also pulls off a great harmonica solo here. It is a fitting tribute to the spirit of Jim Morrison and the kind of hard rock blues The Doors helped influence. \\"Walk On Water\\" is a crunching Southern-feeling scorcher. Another great track here is the live version of \\"Dream On,\\" like the original it is atmospheric, moving, hypnotic and ultimately a masterpiece in melodic rock virtuosity for Aerosmith. There is never anything in modern rock quite like Tyler's vocals and Perry's guitar work. Their influence has not diminished and bands like Train, Kid Rock and Metallica have expressed their fanaticsm for the band. Like The Doors and Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith has produced rock music that has and will continue to endure. Indeed, \\"Young Lust\\" is a great showcasing of how many emotions, moods and exhilarating flavors the band can express. A grea collection of some great rock n' roll.

B000002GGW|4.0|First, let's get the most difficult part out of the way--Roger Hodgson sang and wrote or co-wrote the bulk of Supertramp's hits. True, this was very much a collaborative band and Rick Davies contributed just as much but not if you bought their albums for the hits. Roger has a distinctive songwriting style using a lot of major keys and upbeat lyrical statements. Rick, on the other hand, struck me as more the cynical one of the two. Sure, Roger was missed but Rick did a marvelous job of carrying on with this daring concept album.<br />More prog pop than prog rock, Supertramp managed to blur the lines between top 40 and progressive rock. Brother is an attempt to return to the prog rock roots to a certain extent. Brother reminds me more of Crime of the Century than the band's later efforts. There's a dark and cynical undercurrent to the lyrics and the music is as ambitious as ever.<br />The stunning opening track Cannonball sets the pace. It's lyrics hint at emotional betrayal and, although there has been speculation that it's about Roger's departure, it's strictly speculation. Either way, it's a stunning opener.<br />Better Days pokes and prods the political process and promises that are often betrayed by poiticians once they attain power. It's also a strong track.<br />The title track hasn't aged as well lyrically, but the music carries the day. Dave Gilmour's stunning guitar solos add heft to this ambitious, powerful song. Suddenly, for an instant, the band transforms into Pinktramp. It made me wish Gilmour had guested on more than this song.<br />The closing track Ever Open Door is one of the most heartfelt, hopeful tracks that Davies has ever written. It's fairly straight forward and simple in deliver which is just the tonic one needs after the brutal title track. It's one of the most emotionally powerful songs the band has ever recorded.<br />After the inconsistent Famous Last Words, Brother demonstrated the band could continue to make viable and powerful music. The playing is top drawer. What's surprising is that Roger Hodgson really isn't missed all that much.. The playing is top drawer. What's surprising is that Roger Hodgson really isn't missed all that much.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Okay, I confess, I had to edit my review but I still maintain it aint jazz!!  I bought this album after it appeared on my Amazon[.com] recommendation list and having purchased quite a few jazz cds from Amazon[.com] I thought they'd get it right.<br />I did like the album from the beginning, it has a gentle lulling, almost hypnotic charm about it.  Her voice is wonderful and quite unique.  A wonderful ensemble of tracks that plant themselves firmly in your subconscious to the point you find them running around your mind without you realising.  The first track definately stays with me.<br />This album is exactly as I penned in my review of Richard's Elliot's album \\"Crush\\", you have to give it time to settle and with time it really grows on you.  And it really does grow on you, to the point it hardly leaves my player.<br />So I give it a few more stars than I initially did and profer an apology to Norah for judging her too hastily.  Definately an artist to watch !!

Their leaders back home were attempting to manipulate the political situation in Somalia ... and also ended up blowing up a peaceful meeting of various Somalian leaders (some were even US allies) ... another US mistake the US is too proud to account for ...<br />Black Hawk Down is jingoist rhetoric; propaganda for Bush and his handlers to create a neverending war that only empowers warmongers like Osama bin Laden and John Aschcroft, and not to mention corporations and the best government money can buy.<br />Vote with your dollar and buy a different movie ...
B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammstein are the epitome, the definition, the manifestation of a true metal band. They, with Mutter, manage to be completely unique, if not original. Mixing their own brand of crunchy industrial metal riffs with start-stop tempos and gothic keyboards, Rammstein achieve what is probably their greatest work. Heavier than Herzeleid, without the morbid lyrics. More dance-able than Sehnsucht, but not as poppy. Not to mention all distinctively in German. Mutter is as follows:<br />1.) Mein Herz Brennt(My Heart Burns)-10/10: A deep song, beginning with Till singing quiet verses. Eventually explodes into a heavy chorus complete with orchestra.<BR>2.) Links 2 3 4(Left 234)-10/10: A rhythmic march-type anthem. An almost hit at the time of this album's release last year, with the video of the anthill...The song is a cleverly disguised retraction to critics' claims pigeonholing Rammstein with charges of Nazism.<BR>3.) Sonne(Sun)-9/10: A slightly slower song with female backing vocals and Till singing an epic operatic chorus. Another single.<BR>4.) Ich Will(I Want)-10/10: A very trance-type track, also including female vocals and crowd chanting. Yet another single, for obvious reasons(listen to it!).<BR>5.) Feuer Frei!(Fire!)-8/10: The best description would be industrial thrash(like Fear Factory's &quot;New Breed&quot;), with sirens and the whole band joining in shouts of &quot;bang, bang!&quot; Somewhat repetitive and a little comical, but otherwise good.<BR>6.) Mutter(Mother)-7/10: Rammstein try a power-ballad, which, although deeply personal and featuring beautiful strings, is not up to standard in my opinion.<BR>7.) Spieluhr(Music Box)-10/10: Creepy &quot;music box&quot; effect tossed into a heavy, spooky sounding, track. Robotic child vocals make up the chorus.<BR>8.) Zwitter(Hermaphrodite)-10/10: Funny lyrics. Heavy track with double bass drums and commanding vocals from Till. Sounds like a Rob Zombie track.<BR>9.) Rein Raus(In Out)-7/10: Average song for Rammstein, butstill pretty awesome. There's just nothing to truly separate the song from any of the others.<BR>10.) Adios('Goodbye'in Spanish)-9/10: Rammstein try their hands at punk, and although the song is way too heav to be punk, it is very cool and moshpit-friendly.<BR>11.) Nebel(Fog)-9/10: Another ballad, this time using spooky atmospherics, a female singer, and an orchestra--with more success. Rammstein are overall much better at hardcore tracks, though.<br />Mutter is truly a masterpiece. A complete thrash/industrial metal record. This should be the ideal place for new fans to start and then work their way through Rammstein's back catalogue. Peace.
0871137380|5.0|It is my hope that Ridley Scott's great movie will make more people to decide to read this book. Black Hawk Down is a realistic and gripping read about one of the USA military's most influential actions since Vietnam. Bowden has done a great job, especially considering that he does not have a military background.<br />If you are looking for a book about the history of the Somalian conflict, this is not your book. But if you are looking for a book that gives as realistic an interpretation of modern warfare on the ground as you are likely to see, read this book. Bowden has managed to capture the confusion, fear and action in a straightfoward manner that will keep you turning the pages, and perhaps teach you something. I have read many books about defense and the military, both historical and modern day. This would have to be one of the best accounts of what goes on, on the ground, that i have ever read. And before i am accused of being a gung-ho American - i am actually an Australian, and it didn't detract from my reading at alll.<br />Well worth the time and effort!!
B000007T1M|5.0|There is very little to say about System Of A Down's CD except this: These dudes are totally crazy. This CD makes Tool, Rammstein, KoRn, everyone seem normal. Serj's vocal ramblings are all over the place. He goes from death growls to melodic singing to ranting to squeaking like a mouse. The lyrics must mean something to the band, because they are pretty whack to me. The songs are intense 2-3 minute bursts(except \\"Mind\\") that feature Daron's whining guitar noises and Shavo/John's killer rhythms. The liner notes contain tiny blurps of political wisdom and give clues to the meanings of the songs, all of which rock. Key highlights: \\"Suite-Pee\\"(insane opener), \\"Sugar\\"(single), \\"Spiders\\"(haunting ballad), \\"Soil\\"(w/ guitar solo), \\"Mind\\"(epic), \\"Peephole\\"(circus-type melody and inaudible solo), \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\"(angry closer).<BR>5 Stars, recommended for fans of Faith No More, Dog Fashion Disco or the new SOAD album Toxicity.

B0000640VO|5.0|I did not see this film at the theatre but was so sure I would like it I pre-ordered it and have just now viewed it for the first time...Ive got to say it is the best movie that I have seen in a long time and can scarcely recall a film that I enjoyed as much as Amelie.  It is everything that a great movie should be with many interesting and artful details that defy description.  Director Jeunet is pure and simple A Genius and Tatou was born to play the title role like no one youve ever seen.  Dont miss this if you love great movie-making.
0553381709|5.0|As a fantasy fan, I have read many of the good authors starting with Tolkien, Jordan, Eddings, Brooks, Weis & Hickman, Dennings and it goes on. Martin has gained an unquestionable place among them in my head with this series. It is just superb! There seems to be noone totally good or evil and events happen at a certainly unpredictable way. Everyone is prone to die at any time, while the most unexpected may prove victorious. The story, the plot is obviously the result of a genius mind in this aspect. In this 3rd book, I am nearing the end and yet have no idea whatsoever about how things will go. Trust me, you will never be able to guess what will happen next.
0767853636|5.0|I loved this movie--absolutely loved it. I can't understand how anybody couldn't like it. The acting is unbelievably outstanding--it really is. Indeed, Aileen Quinn was made for this role, and in my eyes, no other child in any other version of this classic can compare to Quinn's most amazing portrayal. Carol Burnett is also uncomparable. Overall, it's just such an enjoyable movie that I have watched and loved ever since I was little. It's a great childhood memory for me. One of the best movies I have ever seen, and certainly not the least bit dull or boring. The music is extremely catchy and strong; the actors have a strong passion for their characters, and you can tell throughout the movie. I hope you will take the time to see this version if you have not already. It's the BEST! =)
B00005JKBC|5.0|People keep saying this is a bad movie because of the story's reasons. This is a MOVIE, not a documentary, not a report of actual life, a movie remember. This is an AWESOME movie from the beginning to the end.<br />The overall style of the scenes, interweaving of storylines, everything is very nicely done. If you liked Fight Club, The Rock or Snatch, you will love this movie. Not that the stories have a similar tone or theme, just that these movies are all in the same \\"coolness\\" category IMHO.
B00005JLDW|3.0|My favorite Matthew McConaughey character is Wooderson from Dazed and Confused... Right...on to the film.  <br />Okay, okay, the plot isn't very good.  But thats just how it plays out.  As another Amazon reviewer has keenly observered, this is an excellent B-movie.  So the plot doesn't really add up to the sum of it's parts.  Get over it, this movie wins cool points.<br />Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey play two survivors in a post-apocalyptic world that is ruled by dragons.  Bale is in hiding with a small community of people just trying to survive, McConaughey is a dragonslayer...<br />Movies like this can be a lot of fun.  Reign of Fire is.  They have electricity, but not showers?  There are so many holes in the story it isn't even worth attacking.  Who cares?  If you see this movie remember to leave your thinking cap on the shelf, it will only hinder your ability to enjoy this film.  Seriously don'y you want to see Matthew McConaughey jump off a town and go flying at a dragon wheeling a giant battle axe?
630469878X|1.0|When this movie was released in 1991, a storm of controversy arose due to the film's glamorizing senseless violence, but, I didn't see the film for myself until 1993.  At that time I was in a state of post-tramautic stress (I was a victim of a natural disaster the year before) and vulnerable, and the idea of the movie swept me off my feet - and on the road.  After watching a tape of the movie a number of times I decided that I too would head out onto the open highway - the worse place for me at the time.  My plans went, in certain ways, as awry as they did in the film (without the violence, however), but it all ended when I ended up in a hotel room, broke and alone, and on the verge of ending up in jail.<br />As far as the tragic ending of the film, well, by 1995 I was back on my feet, somewhat, and working again, somewhat, when someone at my job (a woman about Thelma's age), like Thelma, committed suicide.  Unlike the movie, the despair of those she worked with, including me, was only beginning.  As I get older I've realized that God does not like this ending, at all - no one is supposed to determine their own ending to life, though I thought about it once or twice during my time on the road.<br />The point is, beware of this film - like many things in this life, what appears harmless ends up being a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br />F2
B00005TT77|4.0|For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, you should do so. The acting is brilliant and the soundtrack is very fitting. The idea for the soundtrack is even better, with new interpretations of Beatles classics by various artists. Aimee Mann's duet performance of &quot;Two of Us&quot; was very well done, as well as Sarah McLachlan's &quot;Blackbird&quot; and Sheryl Crow's &quot;Mother Nature's Son.&quot; However, instead of buying the CD, i chose to download the mp3 versions of the songs (a wise decision on my behalf). After downloading the entire album, i was fairly dissapointed with songs 12 and on. In fact, i suggest that you download the first eleven tracks, and save your money. It is certainly not worth purchasing ...

OK, so I'm not very open minded on Richard.....but Penman had me convinced throughout the read that I was wrong. This speaks well for her reputation as one of the best historical novelists. This is where she started. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros. From Eleanor in the 1st trilogy to Joanna in Here Be Dragons to her raising the standard of Simon de Montfort as a visionary (but historically too early) icon of democracy, she does use them as a vehicle to carry forward a dynamic presentation of history....all in the best traditions of the historical novel.<br />Penman's true genius is the broad historical scope that is painted on top of the shimmering details of brief moments.

B0000025BL|5.0|Bat Out of Hell has got to be one of the best albums of the 70's.  Jim Steinman's songwriting is amazing and Meat Loaf's over the top and campy delivery makes it all even more fun.  The album features some other great musicians such as Edgar Winter and Todd Rundgren.  This is a must own for any serious classic rockers!
0345360338|5.0|This is the 2nd book in the Wales trilogy (the others are Here Be Dragons and The Reckoning). Penman emerged long ago as one of the best historical novelists and continues to solidify her reputation with each new release. Her special genius lies in the bright and shining historical detail that she can weave into both plot and dialog (she's a very good student of history and at times is absolutely brilliant in conveying to us the workings of medieval minds).<br />One of the great things about Penman (and this book showcases it well) is her plots are always complex (because the history of these times was quite convoluted). She does an excellent job of keeping it all straight for us as she leads us through the maze of characters. If you read the history of these times you quickly come to see what a great job she does in her design of the story.<br />I have no problem with Penman's romantic feelings about her heros.

B000002HIK|5.0|This album is the crowning acheivement in Richard D. James' repitoire.  Even though it doesn't have the extremely intricate and complex drumwork of his later albums, this album truly lets his genious shine through.  This album is what dancable dreams sound like.  This is what a nightmare invading a delicate plain of gazelle sounds like.  This album shows what falling in love and breaking up sounds like.  It is provides its listeners the pure ecstacy experienced from a first kiss, and the madness harnessed from a first breakup.  On this album, Richard D. James has truly taken every emotion there is to be felt, every experience there is to be had and processed them into a form of beautiful dance music that frightens you.  It truly is a superb masterpeice in any sense of the word.  Not only does this album stand at the height of artistic acheivement and emotional values, it also has a very pop-oriented quality about it by providing melodies that can be hummed throughout a semi-tragic casual friday.  <br />Unfortunately, there are many people that cannot handle the intense experience that is I Care Because You Do.  Many people can only percieve noise or at the best, cheap distorted dance music.  For the people that percieve this album in this way, I envy you, for you obviously have become perfectly content in every aspect of life and have no further need to be challenged and have no reason to let your emotions grasp to anything of this nature.  Again, I envy you.  Even with as much as I support and praise this album, there is no possible way for me to fully explain how it can affect you, for I do not know what type of people most of you are.  So please listen to some samples.  Discover if you are one of the lucky, or one of the people that are still trying to find themselves.
0452282152|3.0|Tracy Chevalier writes books that are easy to read. This one moves a little slower than the Angels book; both took some time to get going. The momentum can be rough, and her writing does not have any striking originality. but she did pick a good subject for sure. She has a knack for recreating periods (or what we think is a recreation of a period), so for one's interest in history, these books are good. There's also a feminist slant which is of interest. She does tend to stack her story with unpleasant characters. It's not brilliant writing for sure, but she gets an A for concept.
B000005RHR|4.0|This album is very typical of Richard D. James' ealier works.  Catchy melodies are coupled with distorted drums.  This isn't one of James' best works, but it is quite good when compared to other dance albums.  Although, if you are expecting true ambience, this album doesn't quite hold true to the title.  This album does however live up to the term &quot;ambient techno&quot; which James is credited with either inventing or pushing to the mainstream.  If you take out the drums, you have a very beautiful album.  If you leave the drums in, you have a very beautiful album that you can dance to.  Also, you cannot be expected to believe the dates on the front of the album either.  In '85 James would have been in his early to mid-teens.  Although, when listening to this album when compared to his other albums, it might be true that he made some of these songs at an ealier age because, although they are very good, they do not compare to many of his other works.  Even with that being said, this album does hold its own against almost every other dance album out there today.  If you are looking at this review, you probably already know about Richard D. James' other albums and how they sound (hopefully), so I do not feel the need to go into detail and explain how the album sounds.  This album sounds much like the albums I Care Because You Do, Classics, and the albums under James' other aliases.  So if you like James' other albums, then buy this one and enjoy.

There are those seeking to be forgiven and those that don't know they need it. It is a story about some that receive forgiveness and some that must have it forced upon them to realize the effect of not having it.<br />Magnolia is filled with characters that are too real, too just-like-someone-I-know. The characters are all exactly the kind you don't want to be a part of your life. It is therein the beauty of the story lies. A little forgiveness goes along way, and the characters from the beginning are mere shadows of the people they are at the end.<br />Two dying men, both with children that hate them<BR>Two young ladies, both seeking a way to change their lives<BR>Two game show contestants linked through time<BR>One cop seeking to change the world<BR>One man hiding his past, to show others a new way of life<br />All bound wholly by matters of chance, to get through one eventful day together.
B000067CPX|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this new RHCP album.  As usual, it's quite good, but incredibly different than what they usually churn out every 2 or 3 years.  After listening through it, I found it to be very similar to the change that the Smashing Pumpkins were trying to achieve when they released their album \\"Adore.\\"  So while at the same time this record isn't the usual awesome Flea slap bass, riff driven stuff, the softer, more melodic direction that the band takes is still interesting.  My favorite songs are the title track, \\"This is the Place,\\" \\"Minor Thing,\\" and \\"Venice Queen,\\" though that's not to say I don't like most of the rest of the album.  Well, I think \\"Universally Speaking\\" is garbage, but I just think it's kind of dull.  <br />Oh yeah... for those of you who aren't fluent Spanish speakers, don't sing or play the song \\"Cabron\\" around those who are fluent.  I don't really want to write what it means, but I suggest you try to find out.  I'm not sure if Anthony intentially put that in because of its translation... weird...
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of those incredible ablums that seems to fill a need in your musical mind that you knew you had, but couldn't figure out how to satisfy. She sings like she's been a world-famous blues musician for decades.  It's a perfect album for calming down, sharing a glass of wine, and luxuriating in an intoxicating, seductive, and sultry listening experience.
0312265859|3.0|After the way Seven Up ended with Ranger in Stephanie's bedroom,I was certain Hard Eight would open with a bang (pun intended).  Instead there was barely a wimper.  I couldn't believe how the author glossed over the scene where Ranger finally collected his debt. <br />On the positive side, I did like the darker tone of this book. Lula is always a hoot. I missed Grandma Mazur and her visits to Stiva's.  The addition of the lawyer was a nice touch and the scene in the laundromat was hilarious!  On the other hand, I thought Valerie was boring, self-centered and nonessential to this story.  Her whiny \\"I need a husband to take care of me\\" was embarrasing in this day and age.<br />When I turned the last page and read the ending my first thought was \\"is that it\\".  I couldn't figure out if the author had cut the ending short for some reason or simply ran out of steam.
B000002IGV|5.0|Twisted Sister paid their dues for the entire 70's in New York clubs. Twisted Sister didn't sound like a hair band. They sounded like a standered early 70's metal group. This is their best album. It also shows Sister was not the block-headed band most people would lead you to believe.

0812550706|5.0|Everyone will like this book, which is the first in a series of four that traces the entire life of Ender Wiggen in chronological order. This may sound boring at first, but Ender Wiggen and his small circle of friends have more impact on the human race over a period of 3000 years than everyone else combined.<br />If you are unfamiliar with the amazing ending, you must read this book immediately rather than risk someone spoiling it for you.
0385121679|5.0|The Shining is a story about a recovering alcoholic author named Jack Torrance who is chosen as the new winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel, a hotel with a dark history. Jack's wife, Wendy Torrance, and his son, Danny Torrance, come along with him. Danny has a power to see things which could possibly occur in the future. This power is referred to as &quot;the shining&quot;. The shining also involves mind-reading. Danny meets a man named Hallorran who tells him he has the shining also, and if there's any trouble, call him and he'll come and rescue them. The snow falls during the winter, isolating the Torrances. The isolation starts to get to Jack, along with the horrific, suicidal, homocidal, ex-caretaker, Delbert Grady. Can this small and dysunctional family survive the unspeakable evils of the Overlook? Will Danny's friend Hallorran be able to save them, or will REDRUM destroy him? Find out the answers by reading this magnificent novel, packed with suspense, horror, and intriguing characters. And, by the way, for you fans of the original Stanley Kubrick film &quot;The Shining&quot;, this book is totally different, but in some ways the same. It's fun to picture Jack in the book like Jack Nicholoson. It makes it even more eerie and interesting. I recommend this for fans of pure horror and suspense!
B00000ICN5|3.0|\\"Texas Flood\\" was a sensation when it came out for several reasons.  One is that the music scene at the time was drowned in droolingly stupid synth-pop, and Vaughan was the absolute antithesis of that.  Second, he was discovered and endorsed by John Hammond, who discovered a number of great blues and jazz artists.  This gave SRV the stamp of approval from the \\"old guard,\\" something that a lot of people who were doing the same thing that SRV was lacked.  Third, he was in the public eye as the guitarist on Bowie's then-popular \\"Let's Dance\\" album.  Finally, he really was a pretty hot guitarist.<br />However, Stevie Ray Vaughan never - EVER - transcended his influences, and the current high esteem in which he is held nowadays is more reflective of his tragic death and his high public profile than his actual playing ability.  There were, and are, several other guitarists who were playing the blues at the time this album was recorded who were as good or better than SRV.  Stevie Ray happened to have the good luck to catch the public eye at the right time.<br />That being said, this album is probably his least excessive and most enjoyable album.  He wears his influences on his sleeve, and there's nothing here you haven't heard before from Buddy Guy, Albert King, Jimi Hendrix, Freddy King, or a number of other guitarists we could all mention.  The difference is that he played as honestly as he knew how with less fuss than on later albums.<br />\\"Texas Flood,\\" is a good, but by no means great, white blues-rock album.  It's not the greatest blues guitar album ever made by any means, and SRV was not the best blues guitarist in Texas, but it is a good album.<br />Stevie Ray Vaughan's greatest contribution to the blues was his humility.  When he did have the public eye, he was careful to give credit to his influences and point out his favorite players.  This educated people (and guitar players) who were unaware of the history of the blues and its players.  In some cases (Buddy Guy in particular) it brought their careers back from the dead and reintroduced them to a whole new, appreciative audience.  He also opened the door for other modern blues guitarists.<br />SRV also reasserted the value of American roots music in a time when the music scene was overwhelmed by some of the most miserable music ever recorded.  He used his pop stardom to communicate his love for the blues, and that is no small achievement.  The hundreds of SRV imitators and wanna-bees who followed in his wake are evidence of his ability to communicate that love.<br />The realistic truth is, though, that there were other guitarists out there - Tinsley Ellis, Jimmie Vaughan, and Bugs Henderson for example - who were doing the same thing that SRV was, at the same time, and it was luck that SRV made the bigtime.  This album shows how good SRV was, but if you compare it to his peers, it shows that he was only good, not brilliant, and certainly not a genius in any sense of the word.<br />Stevie's gift was to be an entertainer and to wake people up to the beauty of the blues, but to call him a genius or a pioneer is to do him an injustice, and he, I think would be embarrassed by some of the hype that is heaped upon his head.  Enjoy this album for what it is - a very solid blues-rock album - and use it as a springboard to explore the blues.  But using SRV as your be-all and end-all of blues guitar isn't good, and it's not what he would have wanted.y Guy in particular) it brought their careers back from the dead and reintroduced them to a whole new, appreciative audience.

B000024ZYP|5.0|If there is an earthquake and I have to grab something and run, it will be this CD. No music has ever touched my heart like this album, especially the second song. Do not buy this CD if your heart is not ready for a huge surge of emotions, and people listening to this album while driving may be subject to police charges for &quot;driving under heavy influences&quot;. It may also be accused of causing insomnia, addiction and excessive memories (happy and sad), among many other things. Rated &quot;R&quot; for emotional maturity.
B000002KKX|4.0|If there is one song to buy this album for, it is SAILING.  What a haunting, beautiful song.  I bought this album on vinyl years ago and it still remains one of my favourites.  His career seemed short-lived after rumours of poor concert performances. Who cares, he had some good radio hits.  His last hit single in Australia was 'Arthur's Theme' in 1981.  You wont find that song on this 1980 album, but you will find other great songs including RIDE LIKE THE WIND and NEVER BE THE SAME.  I even love the cover, it has lasted in my mind.  Worth adding to any CD collection.
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run (called Lola Rennt in its native Germany) is the movie that perhaps best defines the dissafectionist undercurrent present in the final decade of the twentieth century. Set in a stark urban landscape, it proceeds at the same frenetic pace as its protagonist - scarlet-coiffured Lola - as she attempts to save her boyfriend's life. Lola's frenzied desperation is echoed in the beat-driven techno-style score, and through the jerky camera work and rapid shot sequences.<br />Instead of 90 continuous minutes of flowing film, Run Lola Run is split into three scenarios, with widely divergent outcomes. Manni has inadvertently left a bag containing a large amount of money destined for a Berlin Mafia syndicate on the train. He rings his girlfriend, Lola, in a panic, telling her that he needs 100,000 marks in 20 minutes or he's as good as dead. Lola hits the ground running and the three segments follow her quest for fast cash. <br />The movie ponders the age-old question of how one seemingly insignificant action can alter the course of destiny; in this case it is Lola's differing interactions with a boy and his dog on the staircase of her apartment block (shown in a cartoon) at the beginning of each scenario that sets the scene for her subsequent varied modes of action. Director Tom Tykwer lets the camera do the talking, and the sometimes overwhelming barrage of verbosity thrown at the viewer in so many modern films is thankfully absent here.<br />Among the many interesting features of the movie is the use of the flash-forward sequence. Minor characters are given depth by the use of a fast-paced photo montage showing what the future holds for them. It is touches like this, which make this film a cinematic masterpiece and a contemporary classic.
B00005O3VC|5.0|If you've come to this page, and are reading this review because you really want something to laugh at, then you need read no further. Just go ahead - buy Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the laugh-until-you-cry film that's guaranteed to have you rolling on the floor for hours. But if you're skeptical, that's OK, just keep reading and maybe you'll discover why this timeless movie is without a doubt one of the best comedies ever created.<br />I suppose the primary aspect of this film that makes it so funny is that overall, the actors perform their laughable parts with utter sternness. You will wonder: how is it possible to say that without laughing? And you're guaranteed to enjoy scenes of the movie countless times, including the fight with the Black Knight, Caerbannog the seemingly &quot;harmless little bunny,&quot; the cartoon &quot;Black Beast of Arrrghhh,&quot; and of course the French taunting and the Trojan Rabbit. When you're done with the film, you'll definitely want to see the extras, which includes a scene in Lego, a scene in Japanese, behind-the-scenes commentaries, and my favorite, &quot;How To Use Your Coconuts&quot; - a &quot;documentary&quot; on how they used coconuts instead of horses. There's no doubt that this DVD is worth your money - so don't waste any time, just buy it... along with &quot;a shubbery&quot;!
0671004107|5.0|Think about it.  What would the pope have to say?  How would world leaders weigh in?  This incredible book suggests what might happen.  I've read the book twice and enjoyed every page.<br />While the movie was also quite good, the storyline was changed to accommodate Matthew McConaughey.  I imagined Palmer Joss to look and sound like Jerry Falwell.  I have no doubt that Sagen wrote the novel with Falwell in mind -- though I doubt Falwell has tattoos.<br />This book is so good that I enjoyed my second read as much as the first.
B000002H33|5.0|I've been a Metallica fan for several years now. Starting with the song \\"Enter Sandman,\\" I was hooked instantly, and it didn't take too long before I had purchased all of their albums. As everyone knows, there are two generations of Metallica. There are the early thrash albums of the 80's, and the eventual evolution starting with The Black Album that led to less metal, more mainstream songs. Although I enjoy both types of music, and Metallica will likely continue to be my favorite band regardless of what happens, I have to say that Master of Puppets is my favorite album overall.<br /><br />There isn't enough space to write about all of the great songs on this album, so I'll just tell you about the best one, which has also become, to me, one of the greatest songs of all time - Orion. I was enthralled the first time I heard it, even though I had no idea what I was listening to at the time. Now I can listen to it over and over, but I never tire of its almost uncanny chords and melody. It is a magnificent blend of Metallica's heavy beats with seemingly magical rhythms. Don't take my word for it, though, just buy this album and experience the glorious, time-withstanding music for yourself.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I consider this album a success on account of the fact that I actually purchased it.  Seeing as I haven't purchased a CD in probably about two years.  I am not a diehard fan of the genre(wilco, sonvolt, jay farrar etc. etc.) but something about the songs caught me.  Now having owned the album and having listened to it for about two weeks I have to admit something.  Some of the songs sound very similar to other songs and please let me know if you have had the same experience, here's a few I can remember offhand:<br />Kamera - sounds a lot like a Paul Simon song \\"Kodachrome\\" i believe was the name of it, do you think thats why they called it this?<br />Song 4 (War on War) - sounds very much like a radiohead intro, possibly off OK Computer.<br />Pot Kettle Black - Theres a song off Staring at the Sea by the CURE that this songs verse sounds very much like, Close to Me? is that the name of the Cure Song.  <br />I am not saying this takes away from the album, although it is a good solid album (obviously my cynical butt bought it), it would have been nice if Tweedy, JUST ONCE, opened his range up on his voice and gave you a few high notes right where you thought he should open up.  I know others feel this way as well.  It's the sense \\"of lift\\" that Billy Corgan was always talking about.  Although Billy had a questionable voice, he knew how to (in honor of Emeril) \\"kick it up a notch\\" at that perfect moment to bring the song from a foot stomper to something trancendant that would tickle the hair on your arms.  Comon people, you know what I'm talking about...:-)
0441009425|2.0|The base of this novel is the Fermi paradox.  The Universe is ancient and there are huge number of star systems in the galaxy.  Even if intelligent life is a rare event, you'd predict significant occurrence of intelligent life.  Even without faster than light travel, a star faring species could cover a lot of the galaxy in a few thousand years.  Why, then, haven't we contacted or been contacted by extraterrestrials?  Enrico Fermi pointed out this paradox several decades ago.  In this book, the answer is that intelligent life was common shortly after the evolution of the galaxy and led to considerable conflict.  A result was the genesis of machine/computer intelligences devoted to exterminating organic life.  Knowledgeable readers will recognize this idea as a variant of Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series of stories.  Reynolds presents a very complex plot with a large caste of characters to develop this idea.  Included are a lot of what have become the standard props of so-called hard science fiction; cyborgs, nano-technology, artificial intelligence, etc.  The result is a very thick and densely plotted book.  Character development is not very good and this plot is often hard to follow.  Reynolds shows considerable imagination but not much skill as a writer.
B000066I6N|2.0|Man, I've rocked to Plant's music since his solo days starting in the early 80's.  I love his previous albums, and think everything from Heaven Knows to Big Log to Nirvana to 29 Palms is great music.  Then I wait and wait and wait for 9 years to get my greedy hands on Dreamland.  <br />I tried, I really did, I listened to this on the way to work, at my home, when I was happy, when I was chillin, but oh man, THIS RECORD IS JUST PURE BOREDOM.  You want to reach thru the speakers and shake Plant by the shoulders, and ask, WHY ARE YOU HOLDING BACK?.  The lyrics are sometimes moving, but mostly just a montage of 60's songs that have little depth.  I find Hey Joe a disturbing remix that I'll never listen to again, the psychedelic ending is too weird for me.  <br />Oh, Robert, can't you just groove it instead of these boring songs?  Darkness Darkness is like a flight never leaving the runway.  Morning Dew, Another Cup of Coffee, and Song to the Siren will cure any insomnia.  Pretty Red Dress has some promise, but never fully delivers.  Fixin to Die/Funny in my mind is a plant staple that has been mixed into Led Zep &amp; Plant shows for years, it's OK because it's the one of the few songs that actually starts to have some momentum.<br />This album will not do well commercially, and probably will force alot of Plant fans to scratch their heads and say HUH?  I actually met Robert Plant in Atlanta at a bar a few years back, and although cordial, did seem to be losing his edge.  After seeing him tour with the overweight fossil called Jimmy Page, we might (just like the NASDAQ) have seen the best times outta of our favorite bump and grind lead man.  Another solo album?  As long as he goes back to his ROCK roots, and dump the whole 'I gotta do blues because that's the roots of all of Led Zep' garbage, his fan base would be for the better.

It is, in a word, breathtaking.  &quot;Don't Let Go&quot; (the duet) is beautiful, but all of the other songs on this CD, mostly sung by Bryan Adams, are just as good if not better.  Highlights include &quot;Here I Am&quot; and &quot;Get Off My Back.&quot;  If you like Bryan Adams (or just good music!), you definitely need this CD!
B00000BKI4|5.0|Transforming from a noisey indie guitar band Mercury Rev formed in Buffalo, New York in the late 1990's as a means for creating soundtracks to experimental films that they and their friends where creating. From the earlier distorted pop of the debut Album &quot;Yourself is stream&quot; and 1993's &quot;Boces&quot; they have had something of a reputation for being volatile, with their unpredictable early live performances only exasperating the myth.<br />Deserters Songs seems more content, they almost seem happy to be alive. It's an Album that penetrates with it's swooning hypnotic wall of sound, drawing you into a dreamy timeless zone.<BR>I've heard many people describe this Mercury Rev effort as Art Rock. Such genre defining statements don't do justice to the instinctive creativity, the trial and error. Music is always over-lit, and it is exactly in the right brain (intuitive) of human activity the Deserters songs works so well. Through dimensional layers of sound Mercury Rev on Deserters songs are attempting to create the space where music carry's no definition and wears no tag. Derserters songs is a clean and polished change in direction with disturbing yet liberating overtones, one of the Albums of the nineties.
B00005UW7V|2.0|i highly awaited june 29th 2001. the day this came to theaters and i was first in line to see it at my local theater. it sucked. you didnt need that ice angel scene did ya mr. spielberg. i mean for 15 - 20 he sits there staring at an ice angel. this started off great but turned for the worst. do something funner like clip your toenails. just please do not see this movie.
B000021YQV|5.0|I never liked System of a down that much until I heard the song &quot;Prison Song&quot; at a friend's house. I was amazed. I never had heard such a good song. The next time I went to the store, it was the first thing that I bought. When I got home, I put the cd in and was shocked. It was the best thing that I had ever heard. I was wondering what my favorite band was the day before and right then my mind was made up. This CD moved me. THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE GREATEST CD THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD. Every song is very good. You wont even get sick of it after listening to it for dyas. The songs are all very catchy and I know the words to every song. I highly recommend this CD to anybody that likes music. This Cd is the definition of good music.If you can compare it to anything, I would say that It is hard like slipknot, Amazing vocals like Incubus, Musical Genius like Rage Against The Machine, and also, its pure fun! Don't even think, just listen to this album, there is no chance that anyone could ever hate this masterpiece.
6300213668|5.0|As the movie opens, Olivia Newton-John and John Travola are teenagers saying goodbye after a summer romance. When school starts, however, he ignores her to appear cool to his pals and we follow their hi-jinks through their senior year. There are many terrific musical numbers by Olivia and Travola, who epitomize James Dean-era teens. She is very talented and versitile, playing two different kinds of girls in the film.The last scene showing Olivia's transformation from innocent lamb to hot babe in a knockout black outfit is the best. Talented stars, rock and roll, and a little romance add up to a great movie musical.
B00005JL5S|4.0|It was difficult to find this movie to order on-line, but I finally found it on [store].  I bought it for [price]!<br />This is actually a very good movie!  I appreciated the movie's fantastic martial arts scenes and I was surprised that a movie from China had such interesting special effects.<br />The movie had gags, dry humor, great martial arts and a good plot.  Highly recommend.
0316666343|1.0|This is the most trivial nothing that I have read all the way to the end!  And the last couple of chapters proved to be the most disappointing feature of the whole book.  I do not think that characters were well developed and the whole story disappointing.
B000000H5K|5.0|The title track tells you where this CD is going. It's so heavy. This and Chaos A.D. are just great releases and shows the true greatness of Sepultura. Max Cavalera uses his abilities to shout and scream alot better than he does now in Soulfly. Soulfly is cool, don't get me wrong. It just won't ever add up to what this band is. If you're just getting into this band, get either this or Chaos A.D.
B000068OSK|5.0|1. Over-rated - 6 stars IS over-rating them;<BR>2. Bad production - like being able to hear the electricity bristle from the guitar to the amp. ...BR>3. The 3rd incarnation of Led Zeppelin - Zeppelin was the worst band ever, especially when it came to heavy blues (I'm still trying to imagine who was second worse);<BR>4. Cover songs - just plain sloppy, a cover should sound just like the original, and you can never hope to expand on a famous cover of a cover;<BR>5. Lack of bass - everyone knows that without bass a song has no heart, just ask Lightnin' Hopkins;<BR>6. Not the Stokes or the Hives or the Shins - Come on, you can't just play the blues your way anymore. You have to SOUND like someone.<br />Okay, now let's listen to the positives...<br />Sorry, enough with the sarcasm. If you like music (yes that includes jazz & blues unreluctantly) this album is worth the cash. But buy it used. Don't allow it to become an orphan and, more than that, get it out of the hands of someone who doesn't appreciate the raw love of sound.
0767835255|4.0|Despite a plot that strains credibility at times, AIR FORCE ONE is still a superior action film thanks to the always-reliable Harrison Ford and the steady hand of German director Wolfgang Petersen (DAS BOOT; IN THE LINE OF FIRE).<br />Ford portrays President James Marshall, who has just given a speech decrying international terrorism and warning those that would use terrorism for political purpose, \\"Your day is over.\\"  But when a truly despicable Russian national (Gary Oldman) and his men forcibly take over the President's plane, holding not only his staff, but even more importantly his wife and daughter, as hostages, Ford is forced to take matters into his own hands.  The result is not always plausible, and some of the special effects don't work quite as well as they should, but one cannot fault the film's pace or the tension and excitement inherent in the story.<br />Ever since playing Han Solo in STAR WARS and Indiana Jones in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, Ford has developed into a leading man of the action genre--the thinking man's action hero.  That aspect blossomed in PATRIOT GAMES, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, and, especially THE FUGITIVE; and here in AIR FORCE ONE he gets to play the most important man in the world.  He does it with considerable style.  Glenn Close was also a cagey choice to play the first female vice-president, and she does this with incredible fortitude.  William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell are equally fine in supporting roles as part of the President's staff.  And Oldman, whose performance as Oswald in Oliver Stone's JFK was a miracle performance, is equally superlative as the villain, matching the Bruce Willis/Alan Rickman pairing in DIE HARD.<br />Petersen's direction, despite some missteps, never allowed the film to sag; and Jerry Goldsmith's music score is appropriately patriotic without being sickeningly so, and always suspense-building.  This is a film well worth watching.  Don't miss it, especially if you're a fan of such situational thrillers.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This seems to be my the perfect album for me this summer.  His lyrics are insightful and easy to relate to and if you dont feel like concentrating on the words just let the calming jazz-like sound float through your brain for a while.  <BR>  The only way I can compare John Mayer to anyone is the cliche' cross between Sting and Dave Matthews.  He better hurry up and release a new album, I cant wait!
0738206679|2.0|Please skip this review if you are new to this discussion.<br />I am responding to a review below.<br />I just noticed that a reader from Surrey, UK has challenged my earlier review, particularly my opinion that preferential attachment is overemphasized in the book.  Since I have no other method to respond to him, I'll use the review list as a forum.<br />True, I don't have an alternative explanation.  My complaint is that networks have properties other than being scale-free--clustering, average path length, etc.  The networks generated using preferential attachment, while scale-free, do not tend to match in these properties.  (Furthermore, different types of networks tend to differ in these properties, an important fact that wasn't even alluded to in Barabasi's attempt to have a unified networks theory.)<br />Preferential attachment is just one explanation, and a plausible one.  In some instances I think it is a real phenomenon.  In other instances, I don't believe there is preferential attachment at all.  There are some instances where I feel there is preferential attachment in the opposite sense (maybe that is why fads come and go: there is a driving force for people to choose something new after everybody has already seen it).<br />We are clearly missing a crucial piece of the picture.  Either that, or network formation is not as universal a phenomenon as Barabasi would like to believe.
0553106635|5.0|many other reviewers have already eloquently and accurately described the reasons I love the books in this series( Song of Ice and Fire) . My one disappointment - I was sure this book would end the series. So, not only is there another book, there is a fifth on the horizon. I pray that we don't end up with a Jordanesque epic here. He has shown in the Wheel of Time series that more can be less ( Winter's heart was beyond disappointing).I would hate to see the spectacular storyline and characterization in these books succumb to a similar fate
0316666343|3.0|I was looking for some light summer reading and purchased this  book based on the reviews. I thought the premise was something unique and couldn't wait to start. It didn't match up to the reviews. Not much character development and the story jumped from scene to scene without any clear direction. The ending just sort of arrived, like the author was running out of things to say. Overall, I'm glad I read it, but wait until someone like me lends you the book before you spend any money.
B00005OAIE|3.0|I really like this CD. It's not super but better than a lot of the bubblegum junk out there. John Mayer's music has a lot of heart. Room for Squares has some great songs, my favorites ones are No Such Thing and 83. John's music is soothing and his voice's warmth wraps around you like a blanket. Some of his lyrics are a tad bit cliche, but I'm hoping that by his next CD his lyrics will have evolved some more. GRADE:B+
B000068PQ0|4.0|When I first got my hands on the leaked MP3s of this album, I was a little disappointed. It was a nice album, but not nearly as great as \\"The Soft Bulletin.\\"<br />Time can really put things in perspective. Some of my favorite albums have taken a while to grow on me. \\"Yoshimi\\" is one of those albums. <br />The electronic emphasis is startling at first. Steve Drozd's drumming is sampled, chopped up, and spit out amongst drum machines, loops, analog synths, and lush string pads...<br />It took me weeks to realize that almost every song is driven by acoustic guitar. It's not added for texture. It's the backbone. Obviously, Wayne wrote a lot of songs with his acoustic, and they went into the studio and created a lush soundscape for them. Nobody could confuse the Lips for \\"singer/songwriters.\\" They might be inspired by electronica, but they are no Radiohead wanna-be's. One must simply accept the electronics and listen to the SONGS.<br />\\"Do you realize / That you have the most beautiful face?<BR>Do you realize / We're floating in space?<BR>Do you realize / That happiness makes you cry?<BR>Do you realize / That everyone you know someday will die?<BR>And instead of saying all of your goodbyes<BR>Let them know you realize<BR>that life goes fast<BR>it's hard to make the good things last<BR>you realize the sun doesn't go down<BR>it's an illusion caused by the world spinning round\\"
0316666343|5.0|Any story that begins \\"I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973\\" is bound to capture your attention.  The joy of this novel is that it keeps you riveted to the page all the way to the final line.  This is not a murder mystery but rather an odyssey.  The story explores the effects of this girl's murder on her family and friends as she watches but achingly cannot participate from \\"heaven.\\"  The story is well done -- at turns tragic or funny (just like life)-- and always dead-on.  This is a great summer read -- you won't be able to put it down.
B000066NW0|5.0|I got this CD mainly because my friends said it was really good &amp; Avril seems like the type of singer that I would typically listen to, not because I like the song &quot;Complicated&quot;. Dont't get me wrong, the song isn't bad, but it's nothing compared to the CD. I LOVE the CD, and Avril's lyrics truly amaze me. I sure as heck couldn't write the way she does...considering she's only 17. I especially like *Losing Grip* &amp; *Unwanted* because they express so much feeling--and I like more of the rocky/alternative feel to the songs, rather than *Complicated* &amp; *Mobile* etc., but they are all awesome songs in their own way. I would HIGHLY recommend this CD to anyone who is kind of getting tired of the soft pop/alternative approach such as Michelle Branch &amp; Vanessa Carlton, and who wants more of an edge out of their music.
B000067CPX|2.0|This certainly is the worst  Chili Peppers record EVER, I'm  only givin' 2 stars because of By The Way, a good song among such terrible music. Where is Flea's amazing bass lines, John's solos which stick into you head for weeks and that funky style that only the RHCP had? You know what ? Try Californication, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, One hot Minute or Mother's Milk and you shall have fun!
0316666343|4.0|This book was well written and well staged.  The concept was new and original and keeps the reader engaged.  I haven't read another book that intrigued me as much as this one and I would of given it a 5-star rating if it hadn't been for one chapter that left me disappointed in the writer.  I felt she left the margins and came full into the Hollywood fold - as if she anticpated a movie deal.  Nonetheless, it is worth the price of the book and the time it took to read it.  I will look forward to her next novel.
0393316041|4.0|This book is entertaining, no question about that. The anecdotes are very amusing, although Feynman sometimes comes across as a bit of a [jerk]. I think if Haulden Caulfield grew up to be a genius physicist he would be Richard Feynman. I am surprised though so many people seem to put him on a pedestal. I just hope that in the long run Feynman will not be remembered mostly for his smart-alecky pranks rather than for his outstanding contributions to theoretical physics.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Since at least 3 versions of this have now been seen, one would hope that the DVD medium would have allowed viewers to select their preferred version or to at least view a combined version of all finished footage from the previous releases.  Instead, footage from previous versions (unless used in this re-edit) is packed onto disc 2, where it can't be easily viewed in conjunction with the feature itself.  What a pain!  The revised feature, accompanied by interesting commentaries, is solid, and does actually improve some elements of the story, as well as individual scenes.  However, some tidbits of good dialogue are notably absent.  One would have thought that this version would have enhanced character interaction by including more new dialogue, but that's to be found on disc 2.  The 136 minutes includes an \\"overture\\" - 3 minutes of music before the opening titles or even the Paramount logo begin to run, and an additional minute of end credits for the \\"Director's Cut\\" which means that the film itself is still 132, just as the original has been listed in my film/video guides.  Disc 2 analysis shows roughly 8 minutes of footage from the 1983 tv version left out of this new edition, and about 4 minutes of footage dropped from the original theatrical version, which suggests that those 4 minutes were replaced by selected scenes and takes from the 1983 version.  The result plays quite decently, but for those of us who enjoyed the extra footage from different versions, we can no longer see that footage in place, and instead have to look in the disc 2 menus to find it.  We must be grateful that it was included, however.  Featurettes are also enjoyable, included on disc 2.      The film itself plays as well as ever, and is very nice to go back to since the various Star Trek films and series have become increasingly dominated by villains and wars as plot devices.  After just re-watching all original series episodes and the entire animated series, the Motion Picture stands clearly as the epic expansion of the series onto the big screen, but also makes clearer how *all* of the films in the series are just a small part of the entirety of Star Trek.  People may debate which of the films are best, but The Motion Picture is a strong translation of Trek into a new medium (from small screen to large screen).  Sure, elements of the story are derivative (\\"The Changeling\\" and \\"One of Our Planets is Missing\\" being key episodes to recall when watching) but after viewing the 101 episodes of Trek that precede the feature films, there is a clear pattern of derivation that crept into most of the Kirk-Trek products that followed the original three seasons.  Numerous animated episodes are sequels to earlier shows, various themes continue to reappear throughout the series and it seems probable that the scripts for the feature films were more likely to be \\"green-lighted\\" if they resembled favored episodes from the past.  One of the strengths of The Motion Picture, however, is its being true to Roddenberry's vision of the original series - encountering and learning about new lifeforms that in turn teach humans something about themselves in the process.  Later feature films tended to become increasingly \\"villain-oriented\\" - which I would argue is not at all what the original series was trying to focus on.  Only after Roddenberry's death did the various series (and feature films) become repeatedly concerned with the spectacles of ongoing warfare and and endless array of snarling, comic-bookish villains.  Although Star Trek II, III, IV, VI, VII, and IX had their very strong points, only Star Trek IV avoided the cliche of the snarling villain.  The original series was in fact notable for the complex nature of its characters - even antagonistic ones - and a weakness of the majority of the later movies is that they've too-often forgotten the original ideas of Trek and have instead become \\"action-combat\\" spectacles.  The Motion Picture is a spectacle, but is not combat oriented.  Its focus is on the exploration of the unknown - the very point of the original series.  The film can be neatly divided into three sections of roughly equal length.  The first involves the return (after a 10 year absence from filmed live-action production) of the Star Trek characters and the introduction of the re-vamped big-screen Starship Enterprise.  Once Spock gets on board, the introductory \\"episode\\" is over and the adventure itself is underway (including the familiar \\"Captain's Log\\" entry) and the remainder of the film can be seen as a long (two-part) episode; the first half with the encountering of the V-Ger cloud and probe, and the second half (starting with Spock in sickbay) the resolution as learning and negotiations proceed.  This is not at all a sub-par production by any means, when compared to the original (and animated) series - which was all that existed on film at the time of release in 1979.  In addition, the Motion Picture was a superior film for film audiences of its day - especially for those who weren't so well-acquainted with the tv series and thus couldn't know that various themes and plot elements had already been presented there.  (In any case, as the featurettes and commentary and contemporaneous writings on the subject make clear, the Motion Picture story would have been used in the pilot episode of the Star Trek - Phase II tv series if it had actually materialized in the late 1970s.)  Robert Wise was one of the most accomplished directors of his era (The Day the Earth Stood Still, West Side Story, The Haunting, The Sound of Music, The Andromeda Strain) and it's too bad that science fiction films of today don't retain more of the thoughtful approach of past films (as well as retaining the sense of wonder about the discoveries and explorations that do and will take place!)  The basic fact is that each film can tell only so much story and will only be produced every few years, and in this way is a different medium from television and will show limitations in the amount and variety of themes and stories that can be shown, when compared with a weekly television series.  The running times of all the Star Trek motion pictures, plus the entire animated series as well, barely amount to the total running time of a single season of the original tv series.  The Motion Picture was a strong entry in the history of Star Trek, and is an impressive, entertaining, and even thought-inspiring work, and should be recognized as such.
0066620996|5.0|Both 'Good to Great' and 'Built to Last' are must reads for not just CEOs but anyone at every level of an organization (NOT JUST A BUSINESS)!  I have yet to read any management or business publications that better verbalize the road to success.  These are books that can turn around your organization or your life.  Individuals as well as companies should have BHAGs and mission statements and every one should strive to be a Level 5 leader and get the right people on your own personal bus.  If you are a young student of management, a retiring business executive, or anyone in between then these books are must reads.  Outstanding!
B000002WYT|5.0|This is the best Dave Matthews Cd out there, for DMB fans and none DMB fans. This cd will get you hooked on Dave Matthews; with a nice mix of slow, upbeat, and insturmental music you can listen to it anytime in any mood. Some good songs include &quot;So Much To Say&quot;, &quot;#41&quot;, &quot;Drive In, Drive Out&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot; &quot;Tripping Billies&quot;, and my personal favorites &quot;Two Step&quot; and &quot;Lie in Our Graves&quot;...I would DEFINITELY recommend this cd for anyone who likes this kind of music.
B00005J6T0|5.0|Madonna was already an established pop phenomenon, when her third album, \\"True Blue\\" was released.  It contained several monster hits, and solidified her place as the number one pop artist in the world, at the time.  Constantly evolving, Madonna's material also displayed a degree of maturity that was not present in her two previous releases.  No longer satisfied singing just fluff, Madonna asserted herself, having a hand in the composition of each of the songs on the album.<br />The surprising \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", a song about teen pregnancy, was released as a single, guaranteeing that it would find an audience with millions of teenage girls.  To exactly what effect, who can say?  Creatively arranged, and filled with emotion, this song heralded the arrival of a \\"new\\" Madonna.  \\"Live To Tell\\", was another single with a \\"heavy\\" message.  The song spotlights her vocal talents, as Madonna sings with great depth and conviction.  \\"Open Your Heart\\", a composition with an interesting rhythm, and a provocative video that has the singer skirting the dark side, but featuring a lighter, positive message (delivered in leather and fishnet stockings).<br />The hypnotic \\"La Isla Bonita\\", is a beautiful romantic number, set to a Latin vibe.  Madonna did not completely abandon the dance party songs that had first made her popular.  The aptly named, \\"Where's the Party\\", along with \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\", and \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" were songs that could have been from the first two albums.  \\"White Heat\\", dedicated to James Cagney, is another light-hearted tune, with an interesting bouncy rhythm, and a catchy hook.  The title track, \\"True Blue\\" makes you want to sing along, snapping your fingers or clapping to the beat.  It has, if you stretch your imagination just a bit, a nostalgic, early 60's pop feel.  The sound is kind of reminiscent of the Supremes' (Motown) style of production.  Hometown Detroit influences perhaps?<br />Madonna's typically keyboard heavy sound, also evolved a bit.  Apparently, this is her first album with no bass guitar.  Previous albums had included at least some bass.  Any sonic void is filled by the active and creative keyboard work that characterized Madonna's early sound.  Keyboard generated rhythmic lines and fills, and programmed drums too.  Did you ever think that her early songs just sounded \\"different\\"?  The absence of the bass, could be a reason.<br />In total, this is perhaps the most enjoyable Madonna album to listen to.  It mixes songs of innocence and fun, with those dealing with some serious adult themes.  Madonna's singing reflects both her past and her future.  Not always a smooth blend, but an interesting one, coming from the artist at probably the peak of her popularity.a bit.  Apparently, this is her first album with no bass guitar.

B00005JKNF|4.0|The DVD of Gosford Park is a terrific value, and really the best way to see, enjoy, and understand the film. First, see the movie straight through, even though you might miss a third of the dialogue. Second, watch the English- subtitled version (allegedly for the hard of hearing, but a real boon to those of us with good ears who couldn't catch all the dialogue the first time). Third, see it again with the screenwriter's comments. Invaluable! Fourth, once more, with Robert Altman's commentary. In between, watch the deleted scenes, and see &quot;The Making Of,&quot; the &quot;Historical Accuracy,&quot;  and &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; documentaries.  The package is the best use of the DVD format I've encountered. At each viewing, my appreciation of this film increased.
B000002I2I|3.0|it's got \\"Peace Frog\\", which is one of the most original Doors' songs if not one of the original songs by any musician.<br />It also has \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", which is, for me, the ultimate driving song. I always catch myself(before the cops do) doing at least 60, and this is in a residential area. That songs just totally rocks me out, and it also happens to be one of all time favorite songs.<br />Aside from \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", and \\"Peace Frog\\", the rest of the album really disappointed me. \\"The Spy\\" was the only other song here that I really appreciated.<br />I have been a long time Doors' fan, and I have heard all their studio albums. This is not up to par with their debut album or with \\"The Soft Parade\\".<br />I am a huge Blues' fan, so it's not that I don't appreciate their homage to that genre of music.  They just don't seem like the usual Doors' here. Jim's voice is faltering, and the last song especially, \\"Maggie M'Gill\\", had me totally at a loss for words as I thought Jim sounded awful here.  Like, was he possibly drugged up or drunk when recording?<br />Nonetheless, it is worth purchasing for the three songs mentioned here.<br />Eileen Famiglietti
B000002LGA|4.0|Sure, he has limited vocal range; yes, he talks all his lyrics (isn't that his trademark?) and yes, he tries to cram every word he knows into every song... so what? Are you going to let THAT deter you from one of the best albums of the 80s?<br />Truth: I never heard a whole Lou Reed album until a friend of mine loaned me this. I had alll the same misgivings listed above. But from the first time \\"Romeo Had Juliet\\" came out of my speakers, I was hooked. And the great songs keep coming, the sad musing \\"Halloween Parade (AIDS)\\", the 'What's going on outside my window' \\"Dirty Blvd\\"... up to \\"Last Great American Whale\\" and \\"Begining of a Great Adventure.\\" Then it gets right back on track with the brilliant \\"Busload of Faith.\\" \\"Strawman\\" sums up all of Lou's anger at what was making headlines (but offer's no solutions). <br />I would be remiss in not mentioning that Lou's stripped down four piece band is great, especially Mike Rathke on guitar. Seeing Mike has been with Lou since (I got to see them live on the \\"Set the Twilight Realing\\" tour), apparently he found the guy who could hold the band down and let Lou do whatever he likes. And the cook when they have to and they pedal down and get quite when the need to on this record.<br />Look, if you let the record's politics turn you off, you're missing a great album here. It's your loss.
B000063WDH|5.0|Ok seriously folks, friends of mine turned me onto this stuff and this CD (The Big Come Up) is the greatest thing I've heard yet! I can't tell you what an unbelievable mix of blues/garage rock it is, even if you're not totally into that genre-I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed. This never leaves my cd player and my friends all play this at their parties (at NYU). The guitar and drumming beats are so raw and rough which is fantastic and is a great and perfect complement to Dan's smooth strong voice. Play this cd from beginning to end and you'll swear by it. The song \\"I'll Be Your Man\\" has Dan swooning you over making you believe he is singing right to you, but fret not you rockers because \\"The Breaks\\" will move you and groove you. These two hip guys know how to do things right and I can't wait for them to come to NYC!! Hear they are awesome live and I'm sure it helps that they are as attractive as they are talented! I say goodbye to MTV ... and hello to The Black Keys!
0375703861|3.0|The word that kept coming to mind as I read this book was &quot;ambitious.&quot; Smith ties together a legion of vividly and deeply drawn characters, all with different agendas; several different timelines; a rather byzantine central plot; and commentary on everything from genetic research to high school social hierarchy. It's a lot to swallow in one novel.<br />She is most adept at drawing her characters--their physical characteristics, quirks and misgivings come alive on the page. Smith also provides sharp, witty insights on pop culture and life in the mixing bowl that is North London.<br />However, the elaborate character development takes away momentum from the plot, and has the effect of making the plot move in fits and starts. Just when I was starting to enjoy a scene or get into one character's actions, she'd go off on a tangent that seemed to link characters and actions only very remotely to each other. At times it felt a little self-indulgent, like she was admiring her own ability to turn a clever phrase or take the action momentarily off-course and then bring it back again. <br />By the time I was 400 pages into the book, I was asking, &quot;How in the heck is she going to wrap this all up into an ending?&quot; I think Smith was asking herself the same question at this point. The ending comes off as a bit of a stretch, but she does manage to pull things together reasonably well. Still, after I closed the cover, I said, &quot;huh?&quot; and had to go back and reread some earlier sections to figure out how they tied to the ending. <br />To me, this book needed a skilled editor who could tighten things up and keep things moving with out taking too much away from the rambling, bildungsroman-esque nature of the plot. It'll be interestesting to see what Smith has to say in her next novel--this one seemed to cover every base, at length.
0767830555|5.0|For me,I think this is probably the finest collaboration between Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro.Even now after so many viewings I still remember the incredible impact this amazing film had on me the very first time I saw it.Bernard Hermann's fine score adds tremendously to the squalid atmosphere and the disintegration of Travis Bickle's fragile mind.70's film-making at its zenith.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I think this is the BEST video game turned movie!!! Oh My God the zombies were AWESOME~sooooo Real!!NOT cheesey AT ALL! My two fav parts of the movie was the beginning and the the ENDING!!! that waz the BEST ending to a movie I have ever seen! awww that ending!:-D very well done movie! I bought the DVD and watched it 3 times the first day! the commentary is GREAT/FUNNY! i give this movie 10/10!!! The beging of the movie told alot about the corporation what it does. AND those high kicks that Milla does~alittle unbelievable~but thats what makes it great!!! her fighting adds to the movie. The only thing i didnt like was the music!! I mean it was so loud at time that I couldnt hear them talking at all! and took away the atmosphere! but this movie is the BEST Horror flick in YEARS! cant wait for the Sequel! \\"Nemesis\\"
0316666343|3.0|I also saw Anna Quindlan on the Today show stating that this is the one &quot;must read&quot; of the summer and dutifully checked our local bookstore twice in anticipation of purchasing the book. I was hungry for a good read, and have to admit that I read and finished it quickly.  There is something to be said for that in my case, as I am known to abandon books easily. I generally was disappointed in the book and I think I was looking for something  in the book, which I did not find. Having lost some loved ones myself, I did not find my own emotions, especially pain and  longing that I associate with loss in this novel. The characters dealt with grief in various ways, but only her father came close to my perception of loss. I am usually easily moved to tears but the author did not evoke that in me...save for the last words of the novel, which were so heartfelt and honest.  I had a hard time following some of the lesser characters in the book, and did not feel they were adequately developed. I think I am in a minority in my perception of the book, so I would advise you to read it and form your own opinion:)
B000003S0B|4.0|Poseidon, on its own, would be a fine record, but comparisons with the first Crimson outing are inevitable. The structure of the work is initially similar: a raucous, jazzy introduction, a quiet song, a dirge; Cat Food introduces Beatles-esque work, amusing and tuneful. The rest of second side seems inspired by Holst's The Planets. The album is tied together by quiet interludes that share Peace in the title.<br />The themes of love and war are explored in Poseidon, as they were in the first album, but the lyrical structure is simply not as effective. Where \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is lonely and moving, \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" is lovely but more about a strange sensuousness than love. The anti-war sentiments have less of an impact, probably because the poetry is simply not as good: \\"Peace is the end, like death of the war.\\" This may be a nice sentiment, but the scope is shallower.<br />So, I still enjoy hearing this album. The music is really quite fine, and the opening much more palatable then Schizoid, but ultimately this cannot match the perfection of the first.<br />PS, I read Dr. Wild's essay on this album after I did my reviews. Indeed, I wrote all of my KC reviews before checking out what others said, with the exception of the first. Dr. Wild makes many valuable comments. Devil's Triangle is clearly superior to Moonchild, although I must take issue that Cadence is better than I talk to the Wind. It is more than alright, it is perfect, beautiful. I ended up ranking Poseidon next-to-last, but it still receives four stars, which means it's a great record.
6302491940|4.0|Great car chase with Mini cars. Watch out for Benny Hill the famous comedian in a cameo role. Michael Caine is his usual &quot;cockney&quot; self but his humour and natural acting is very good. Cliffhanger ending has never been copied to date. The beginning is superb when the song &quot;On Days like These&quot; plays to exquisitely beautiful mountain scenery until.... Why spoil the suprise? Watch this movie and find out.
B00005AFMT|5.0|This really is an incredible King Crimson disc. As fans know, the work follows a significant hiatus and personnel change. The introduction, Elephant Talk, is antic, manic and frantic. Fripp's new guitar discipline, a tonal configuration which begins with this venture and has yet to be abandoned, is presented in Frame by Frame, a scintillating live version of which is available from B'boom.<br />The sublime love song, Matte Kudasai, foreshadows the calm of The Sheltering Sky, but not until we are dragged through the riotous Indiscipline and the even wilder Thela Hun Ginjeet.<br />I became deeply, deeply addicted to The Sheltering Sky. It is a shimmering, mesmerizing masterpiece. It stands alone in the Crimson canon. There had been nothing like it at the time, and there has never been anything like it since. A super fuzzed out guitar takes a theme higher and higher. There is no limit, it seems, to the heights that will be ascended. This initial exploration, an A section, is followed by a beautiful B section, in which the bass is featured, accompanied by guitars, and electrically filtered, echoing, reverberating, descending figures that seem to come from the heavens themselves. This is an extremely effective evocation of the grandeur of space, with a hint of deity. A concluding guitar solo that also reaches for the skies leads us back to an A section, and once again we are taken gradually upward, musically. How lofty? To infinity itself, a note on the electric guitar that seems limitlessly high.<br />The conclusion to the disc is necessarily challenging, and Fripp opts for Discipline, a mechanical exploration of a theme with busy drums and guitars in perfect unison despite numerous key and rhythmic changes.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Okay, so the title of this review is extremely debatable.  However, there is no denying that the Broken EP is one of the best examples of industrial metal that has reached a mainstream audience.<br />This record, if looked at in the context of Trent Reznor's entire catalogue, can seem out of place at first.  The hyper-aggressive guitars used throughout Broken are almost entirely absent from his first album, \\"Pretty Hate Machine,\\" and his second full album, \\"The Downward Spiral\\" balances aggression with more subdued tracks.  To make sense of this record, one has to put it in the context of Reznor's life.  His battle with his record company reveals this to be the method Reznor chose to channel his rage.<br />And boy, is he angry.  If you enjoyed \\"Star..., Inc.\\" from The Fragile (another example of anger focused into music) you are going to LOVE this album.  After the buildup in \\"Pinion\\" Reznor does not provide the listener with a release until the silence between \\"Gave Up\\" and the hidden tracks, which are just as aggressive and angry.  Throughout it all, Reznor includes bone-crunching riffs that at times express his emotions better than the lyrics.  In the end, the listener is grateful that this was not a full album: it is doubtful whether ANYONE could take that much aggression in one sitting.
B000003S0I|5.0|This album corrects, very significantly, the flaws of the previous Islands, and indeed, this is the finest King Crimson since their first line-up. Lyrically, the impression is not nearly as lasting, but ah, the music. This is really Fripp's debut as the central force behind the group.<br />This was a record that begged to be released on CD. Parts of the original vinyl were almost inaudible, because the dynamic range was way beyond what vinyl was able to offer, and the slightest imperfections caused irritating pops and crackles during quiet sections of the works that are now completely gone.<br />The violin is still used on Larks', but much more intelligently. The idiom is jazz even though the inspiration is apparently Vaughan Williams's A Lark Ascending, a romance for violin and orchestra.  The improvised passages in the long opening wear a bit thin, but the sound is not unpleasant, and the first installment of Larks' Tongues ends with a monstrous drum roll and beautiful guitar arpeggios.<br />Book of Saturday is lovely pop song in the tradition of &quot;I Talk to the Wind.&quot; John Wetton makes his debut here with a smoky, bluesy, attractive voice.<br />The opening of the next piece, Exiles, is strange and spacy, and breaks into another beautiful tune. This is not unlike Epitaph musically, but the words are not as effective. Still, the melody is the key here.<br />Easy Money is an interesting answer to Pink Floyd's Money, and features spectacular sound.  Extremes of dynamic range are explored in this piece, from atmospheric interludes to an electronic &quot;wall of sound&quot; (to quote a Stereo Review article).<br />Atmospherics are continued in the form of recordings of wind, which give way to The Talking Drum, a long instrumental which builds to a climax and leads with shrieking guitars without pause to a rocker, Larks' Tongues - Part Two, which recalls and develops musical themes from the introduction. The orchestral interludes will be eliminated in subsequent re-workings of this musical idea.<br />All in all, a creative work of lasting impact.t re-workings of this musical idea.<br />All in all, a creative work of lasting impact.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Yes, the special effects were great. Yes, it was an enjoyable watch, and yes, the quidditch scene rocks my world. But as some people said, this film was a dissapointment.<BR> <BR> It seriously moved way to fast and dropped too many IMPORTANT elements out from the book. Instead of cutting Hermione's scene with Snape's potions, they could've cut down Seamus's scenes with him exploding his goblet of water and exploding his feather in Charms class to make time for Hermione's scene. <br /> There were of course, the good points.  Emma Watson's acting was superb and the quidditch scene was very realistic - not only with the flying scenes but with the points as well. In the book, you can usually tell right away which team was going to win - which is a very slight flaw in JK Rowling's writing skills :) She usually has one team with over a hundred points while the team that you KNOW is going to lose has ten points - the movie equals the points out, adding to the climax and the excitement because you don't know which team is going to win. <BR> It's worth watching though, but the book is better by a thousand times.
B000003S0D|4.0|King Crimson's third record represents yet more personnel changes, with the ever-present Fripp at the helm. The most striking feature of this record at the time of its release, for me, was the sound. It was amazingly well engineered. It still is impressive, and there is a King Crimson record broken here as well - longest King Crimson piece at over 20 minutes. Jon Anderson contributes a fine vocal performance.<br />Lyrically, Lizard retreats entirely to fantasy and humor. Gone nearly completely is the social commentary that made the first Crimson such a strong artistic statement. Still, this is considerably more original than Poseidon.
B000002GVO|4.0|Starting with one of the odder topics for a hit single (Is it Hell or just a very odd check in policy?) Hotel California shows the influence of Joe Walsh's addition to the band right away. The softer edge of Southern California rock is sharpened to a point on the title track, \\"Victim of Love,\\" and especially \\"Life in the Fast Lane,\\" which gives the listener exactly what the title says. Even the softer tunes like \\"The Last Resort,\\" \\"New Kid in Town,\\" and \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\" seem to hit with more musical power (listen to the bass and piano on \\"Maids\\") and the lyrics have a bittersweet feel to them. I find this to be the most memorable of the Eagles recordings, and except for the greatest hits collections the one to own.
B000003S09|5.0|I have just started going through the reviews of one of my all-time favorite \\"groups,\\" which of course King Crimson really isn't. For me it really is about Fripp, but anyway, 30 years ago, when I bought this record, it was only because the cover was wild.  I had no idea what I was in for, an introduction to the entire \\"art rock\\" scene. At the time, 21st Century Schizoid Man was terribly grating. Now, so much later, and after having not heard the record for several years during my transition to CDs, the song is jazzy and creative, disciplined and virtuosic.  These are qualities that will never be abandoned during the 30 year King Crimson project.<br />I still think the second song is deeply moving. Greg Lake's voice was so beautiful, the words so wistful \\"I talk to the wind, my words are all carried away, I talk to the wind, the wind does not hear, the wind cannot hear, I'm on the outside looking inside, what do I see? Much confusion, disillusion, all around me.\\" The electric piano, the flute, the beautiful melody, the delightful jazzy flute improvisation, the light and inventive drumming. After hearing this song, no wonder so many customers give this record the highest rating.<br />After this beautiful work, the record quickly reaches a climax, which is followed, on side two of the original vinyl, by a long denouement.  I refer to Epitath: \\"The wall on which the prophets wrote is cracking at the seams, upon the instruments of death, the sunlight brightly gleams.\\"  \\"When every man is torn apart with nightmares and with screams, will no one lay the laurel wreath when silence drowns the screams?  Confusion will be my epitaph as I crawl a cracked and broken path, if we make it we can all sit back and laugh, but I fear tomorrow I'll be crying.\\"  Mellotrons, acoustic guitar, \\"Between the iron gates of fate, the seeds of time were sown, and watered by the tears of those who know and who are known. Knowledge is a deadly friend, if no one sets the rules.  The fate of all mankind I fear is in the hands of fools.\\"<br />Well folks, you wonder how far we have come since those lyrics were written!!  I don't care what any classical music buff would say about this work as poetic and musical art. I think it is absolutely spectacular.  There are a lot of people (I would venture that at least thousands) who cannot repress tears during this song. It is wrenching and totally true, and such a perfect combination of words and music.<br />After the jazzy quiet of Moonchild, we are treated to one more march, similar in tone to Epitaph, but instead of being a dirge, it is a spacy evocation of medieval times: courts, kings, jesters, puppets. The solution to the problems presented in Epitath is to be found in delightful flights of fantasy.<br />Is this the greatest King Crimson ever? Probably. Did Fripp never surpass himself in directing a group to perform a large-scale work characterized by an overarching musical and lyrical thematic structure? Probably not. I have all of the King Crimson studio releases and a few of the live ones so I know this to be the case. This work, to emphasize, in the sense of a large piece, almost a suite of sorts, is unique in the history of rock, and unsurpassed by any subsequent release. For a bunch of kids, and that's what most of them were 30 years ago, they created an enduring work of art.ankind I fear is in the hands of fools.\\" <br />Well folks, you wonder how far we have come since those lyrics were written!!

B00005RY7X|1.0|this is the most vapid and pathetic cd i've ever heard.  EVER.  The only reason I am reviewing this is to prevent any self-respecting music fan from the humility I am experiencing right now as I listen to this cd at work.  DON't let anyone EVER see you in close proximity to this cd!  Any cred you've no doubtedly spent years on building will be blown instantly!  the best part about the album (beside the end if you make it that far) is the cover, i have a feeling that it was taken immediately after good ol' andrew handed the master tapes over to his record execs at Island.  I woulda popped him one too!  Unfortunately amazon doesn't have anything less that 1 star, because this cd is definitely beer coaster fodder.  This guy is so bad he's the next Crazytown.  They should have to listen to each others cd's and then kill themselves out of boredom.
B000003S0F|3.0|I certainly recall how mystified I was by the strings and semi-classical sounds of the title piece, and I will admit that years later, the classical foray is far more palatable than I originally found it.  Still, the album seemed incomplete at the time and does to this very day.<br />Nevertheless, the opening is quite amazing. Formentera Lady features a vocalise by a weak soprano. The song makes a seamless transition to the driving beat of Sailor's Tale, thus presenting as the opening what is essentially a 17 minute work.<br />The Letters is melodramatic, but the opening to the second side, Ladies of the Road, is a King Crimson classic, very Beatles-esque, totally irreverant. The saxophone is used to tremendous, sexy effect.
0385503954|5.0|Undoubtedly, McEwan has renewed my faith in contemporary fiction!

0316666343|5.0|What a daring first novel.  Alice Sebold's story The Lovely Bones is a heartwarming and inspiring tale.  This novel is a fairly quick and easy read that I found almost impossible to put down.  Well thought out and developed, this novel is a must read for anyone who has ever wondered about what lays beyond.  My only complaint would be the chapter toward the end of the book in which Susie gets a second chance at love.  The chapter did not flow well or match the previous character development.  Was this the publishers idea to stretch out the book?<br />It will be interesting to see what original idea Mrs. Sebold comes up with next.  The question remains:  Will it be as good?

B00005NW02|5.0|If you get the rage out of \\"Rage Against the Machine\\", you get System of a Down. Now, for their second album, their style continues with fast guitar riffs and headbanging songs like \\"X\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\". In a heartbeat, they declare their messages in \\"Science\\"; talking about how science itself changes our beliefs and damages the world, and also in \\"Toxicity\\"; how the poison of evil damages our cities. Besides the fact that System of a Down shares their beliefs in most of their songs but gives the album a twist with \\"Bounce\\", a song with interesting and funny lryics about jumping around on a pogo stick. Also, I happen to see that people cannot out-match Serj's incredible vocals and lryics found in the album's first hit \\"Chop Suey!\\". With bizarre lyrics and headbanging riffs, this album fills itself with warping styles and strength.
B000002C1V|3.0|My first impression of this album was that it was missing something. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Shortly after I got this CD, I purchased both the Division Bell and Momentary Lapse of Reason. Granted, these albums were years apart, and you might think the writer knows little of Pink Floyd, but that could not be further from the truth. I refrained from buying these works for years in sort of a passive protest for all the childish actions that the band has undergone in the 80's and 90's. Through several listenings of all three albums, a nagging feeling kept growing inside me. And then it dawned on me. None of these three albums are really Pink Floyd.<br />Pink Floyd is Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason. Each of these three albums is missing at least one of the necessary ingredients. Pink Floyd is not Waters with a bunch of studio musicians, and Pink Floyd is not the other three without Waters. This is yet again a case of the whole being much greater than the sum of its parts.<br />To me, Pink Floyd is Water's introspective, dark, and brooding lyrics tempered by a more positive mental outlook by Gilmour. It is Gilmour's tasteful guitar that intertwines very neatly between and around Wright's keyboard, all built around the foundation of Water's bass and Mason's drums.<br />Although each of these albums are \\"nice\\" in their own right, they could never achieve the status of being a Masterwork that \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" were able to garner. A band's sound usually evolves in the following manner; in the early days the music is usually something rather raw-or in Floyd's case relatively experimental (\\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\"), it begins maturing as personal playing styles begin meshing with the other members (\\"Ummagumma\\" through \\"Obscured by Clouds\\"), until a certain mature style has been achieved (\\"Dark Side\\" through \\"The Wall\\").<br />Pink Floyd had the unique opportunity to evolve into something further hadthe members been able to set aside their differences for another decade or two. I would have loved to hear what these albums \\"could have been\\" with the complete, unrestrained, and heartfelt input of each of the four. Unfortunately, what happens to many bands happened with them. The Beatles were never as good individually as they were as the Fab Four, the same with Chicago and Peter Cetera, the same as Yes minus Squire, Anderson, Howe, or Wakeman. The list seems endless.<br />Why can't the promoters leave well enough alone? Can't they see that every time one creative member of a group is lured out of a band, that neither the lured nor those that are left succeed nearly as well as they had before the breakup?
B000002LND|5.0|This collection of seventeen top twenty hits is probably an album that can truly live up to it's title. Her ability is uncanny for producing enthralling pop music. The opening trio of songs - &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot;, and &quot;Borderline&quot; - are great slices of early 80s dance pop. The lyrics and tone are fun, flirty, and bouncy. Following those tunes come two songs that proved to be a pair of the most defining songs of her career, &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot;. She also proves she can be an able ballad singer, singing slow songs that compliment her voice rather than stretch it out of place, in &quot;Crazy For You&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot;. Inbetween these two tunes, is perhaps my most favorite Madge tune, the get up and dance anthem &quot;Into The Groove&quot;. Words can't describe how truly contagious it is. More of my personal favorites follow, in the classic &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;. Two truly great pop songs. More strong singles follow - &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, and &quot;Cherish&quot; - all which set the charts on fire. Another true moment of excellence is found in the dance classic, &quot;Vogue&quot;. One of her most defining songs. The next two singles were 'Immaculate' exclusives. The scandalous &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and the thumping &quot;Rescue Me&quot; were both top ten hits. I really couldn't have a bad word about this album. A flawless pop compilation.
B000007T1M|5.0|this is the best cd i have heard in a long time usually you get whiney bands that all sound the same and are always whining about how they got dumped no one likes them. which gets old system of a down is more orignal like tool they have their own sound and don't rip anyone off. which is common among newer bands. P.L.U.C.K is the best song on the cd by far but thats just me any way buy the cd.

6305041156|4.0|First of all, I want to say that this is one of the greatest films of the past 20 years, in any language or genre.  It is a true masterpiece and obviously the work of a master director (who also directed Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Ikiru).  The imagery is astounding (and NO computer special effects, folks, it's all real), the sound is haunting and eerie, and the storytelling impeccable.  For newcomers, this is essentially a re-telling of the King Lear storyline (Shakespeare) but in a medieval Japanese setting with warlords and samurai.  It is an action film of sorts, but despite the obvious power of the action, the deepest strength of this film must lay within the tragic drama of the story.  This is not a happy film nor a feel-good film but it is a film that will remind everyone in these days of MTV-editing and flashiness and loud bangs how powerful a film can truly be when in the hands of a master.<br />Ran is not for everyone, of course.  It has a deliberate pace and is set in a non-English background, which makes it foreign to a lot of Americans.  It is Japanese, so the cuts are long and scenes are allowed to play out.  People who don't like slow films (example, Kubrick films or Russian films) might not like this aspect of the movie Ran.  The style of filmmaking harkens to older days of cinema, but then again, I've always thought the older films were better than today's movies anyways.<br />I just want to say a few words about the DVD itself.  It is truly bizarre and obviously one of the first wave of DVDs when DVDs were still new.  The transfer is not so good.  There are dust and scratch marks here and there, but I can accept this on an older foreign film; picky DVD owners may not.  It is also non-anamorphic and is essentially just an extremely good VHS copy placed on DVD format.  At least it's in widescreen.  But it is a weird widescreen, which instead of being centered, takes up the TOP 2/3 of the TV screen, with subtitles on the bottom.  This takes some gettingused to but it's acceptable.  The WORST thing, though, which may definitely turn off potential buyers, is that the middle of the film has a really soft focused look to it, as if it were projected through a widescreen lens with condensation in it.  The middle portion totally looks like poor VHS quality.  Oddly enough, the first and last thirds of the film look okay in terms of focus.  Was this some blunder by the DVD company in the transfer process?  I can't believe they let this slip by.  Oh well.<br />Anyways, final analysis...the film gets a strong 5 stars but the unusual transfer bumps the final rating down to 4 stars.  If you are a film buff like myself, you may overlook the shortcomings of the DVD and buy it anyways, especially since a re-issue is not going to happen anytime soon.
0345440900|3.0|The Baby Whisperer helps you decode why your baby is crying.  She presents several tables for reading baby's body language, and listening to the pattern of his/her cry.  And if going by her recommended E.A.S.Y. schedule, you'll be able to differentiate between cries of hunger, tiredness, overstimulation, wet-diaper, etc...<br />E stands for eat, which she recommends breast fed babies go every 2.5-3 hours and bottle fed ones every 4-5 (as recommended in many other texts). A for activity time which should immediately follow the feed.  Usually, babies fall asleep after being fed, activity is recommended so that baby will not build the \\"suck-to-sleep\\" association and be dependent upon a breast or bottle to fall asleep.  S is the sleep portion, where she provides sleepy signs to look out for to get baby to bed immediately.  Y is time for you, provided your baby is able to adhere to this schedule.<br />Problems with the book?  Well, she talks about placing baby to crib as soon as you see the \\"sleepy signs\\", haha, much easier said than done.  There are some tips on how to get your baby to sleep if you happen to miss the signs, such as swaddling, pacifiying, shushing, and patting.  While some of these tips are helpful, there are only 4 or 5 pages of the book dedicated to showing you how to do so.  Eighty percent of the book is anecdotal, she talks incessantly about families she's worked with using her techniques, but nothing really useful and practical, as these are the same tips on those 4 or 5 pages which are repeated throughout the anecdotes.  If you visit the official baby whisperer website, you'll see that she's had to add a supplemental question and answer session regarding her sleep techniques as they are so poorly explained in this book.  You may as well just go to the website and read it there.<br />The bottom line is, if you're looking for a book on how to get your child to sleep, this is not it.

B000069HK2|5.0|if you like thrice, and thursday, and finch, and so on and so on, buy this cd and they will all be blown out of the water.  those bands have nothing on the used, this was by far the best cd in its genre.
B000067CPX|4.0|Their latest album, \\"By The Way\\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is a magnificent piece of work that blends traditional Peppers punk/funk with a totally new sound that incorporates instruments never used in any other of their previous recordings.  A piano used in songs such as \\"Dosed\\" and \\"Tear\\", gives the Chili Peppers a sound reminiscent of the Beatles.  Harmonica, violin, trumpet, and Theremin (that weird instrument used in the Beach Boys \\"Good Vibrations\\") are also incorporated into songs on the album and may open a door from where the listener can see their musical influences.  Besides the new instrumentation, harmony plays an important roll in bringing the musical concepts together in a pleasing way.  Throughout the album, John Frusciante sings background vocals while Flea and Smith shout out ooooh's and ahhh's.  This combination of musical elements adds to the vertical progression of the music, which is very pleasing to the ear.  Although many of the lyrics leave me a little confused about the meaning of a few of the songs, the album has the same general theme as their lyrics in past recordings, which include drug abuse, sex, love, and spirituality.  In the Spanish sounding song \\"Cabron\\", Kiedis sings about peace and humanity, while accompanied by the amazing Frusciante on acoustic guitar. There is much less fast funk rap style in this album than in previous albums, but the slowed down Chili Peppers sound is pleasing to the ear and adds an element of mystery.  I am on the edge of my seat anticipating what comes next.
B000067CPX|3.0|well ive only heard maybe a half of this album, and im hesitant to buy it. from the songs that i have heard, By The Way and Tear are the only keepers. everthing else sounds like filler to me. i realize how great californication is after listening to this new album. i was hoping for more songs in the californication style of sound. Ohhh well. besides by the way and tear, what other songs make this album sound so good??? please tell me, id love to know.
0748662731|5.0|I lived in Botswana for two years and I share the warm, humane view of it that comes out of these books. Only Alexander McCall Smith goes much deeper and brings to life a whole world of wonderful characters. I am a Tony Hillerman fan, but Smith is a far better writer and the cumulative effect of the books is a magnificent, gentle portrait of a whole society. He must have lived there for years.
0553579908|5.0|Martin's first foray into the Song of Ice and Fire set the stage with a very good set of characters and a very intricate plot. However, it only gets more interesting in this second book of the series. In this book, the War brewing between the contenders for the Throne explodes, with well scripted battle scenes as well as the behind the scenes pre-battle intrigue. Off over the sea, dragons have been reborn, and magic is slowly returning to the land with sometimes comical results. To top it all off, that one underdeveloped character in Book one we all knew somehow we couldnt trust, (Theon), proves us all correct in one of the most heart-rending examples of betrayal I have ever read.<br />Characters seemingly on the sidelines in the first book come to the fore, adding their own well developed personalities and ambitions to the already tempestuous brew. Magic and Sorcery rear their (so far) ugly heads, as a mysterious female priest of the Red God enters the picture and begins to tip the scale in the early stages of the War in favor of one of the conflicts main participants. Tyrion, the deformed genius, steps to center stage, and he turns out to be a likeable rogue whose blemishes aren't all physical, but who demonstrates he has a heart and soul under all that scheming, Lannister exterior. Jon takes a bit of a back seat in the action until the end of the book, while his brothers receive more character development. Sansa, the most annoying character, stays annoying, though perhaps a little wiser.
0316666343|5.0|Since I finished this book in one day, and have been haunted by it ever since, I am forced me to believe that this was no ordinary tale and that the story teller is extraordinary.<br />Haunting, chilling, and wonderful, Sebold's saga of a dead girl in heaven and her family on earth is not for the faint of heart.

B000002J1B|4.0|Yes bassist Chris Squire ,&quot;I think what Alan and I played on Relayer was more to the point. Some of the bass and drum interaction on there is better than anything to be found on previous Yes LPs&quot;. This is indeed a rollercoaster of a ride album rhythmically , but not just that as Steve Howe and Patrick Moraz let it all hang out. Whew! Wakeman had rehearsed some of this album's sections during soundchecks before deciding that , like &quot;The Ancient&quot; on Topographic Oceans , &quot;Yes was heading towards avant-garde jazz rock and I had nothing to offer there&quot;. The astoundingly unique Swiss keyboardist Moraz did have much to offer in the more freely experimental vein that Yes were now mining. His &quot;futuristic&quot; burbling synth sounds and novel-for-the-time pitch bender controling added a &quot;brave new world&quot; to the Yes tonal pallette. It would seem that Chick Corea's exceptional work on the mid 70's Return To Forever albums owe a debt to Moraz. Decide for yourself. Anyway , before Yes decided on Wakeman's replacement , Steve Howe took the oppurtunuty afforded him as the temporary sole lead instrumentalist and constructed some of his most tonally and rhythmically cutting-edge guitar work ever. Its as if he was thinking Chet Atkins in space meeting John Mclaughlin's work in Mahivishnu! Not to mention that Alan White also partly appeared to be under the Mahivishnu spell , in this case , Billy Cobham ( probably his Spectrum LP too , which Massive Attack sampled in the 90's ). Indeed , this was all very forward thinking stuff with much less concern over including Wakeman-like quasi-classical orthodoxy. With the exception of Moraz's tasteful synthesizer fugue later on in the golden light warmth of the eastern-flavored &quot;And You And I&quot;-ish follow-up &quot;To Be Over&quot; , Relayer is really a sharp turn with a whole new bag of tricks ( electric slinky on &quot;Gates&quot; , for one ). Dig the incredibly tight arrangements and see ifyou can even figure out where the center of the beat is by the middle of cacophonous battle sequence of &quot;Gates&quot;. Its like hearing the history of war in fighting sound effects! A bit overwhelming for some , but there is the definitive version on Yesshows. This still is overwhelming in a way that only Yes could seemingly achieve and WILL keep your interest , whether you are blown away by the audacity or put off. The end is about as gorgeous a thing as Yes has ever composed , with Jon just soaring. A calling of reconcilliation as I see it. Speaking of audacity though , Soundchaser displays Yes at probably their most complex , at least as far as unison playing goes. Howe is absolutely a speed demon here , but then so is White and Squire! Moraz goes for a Jan Hammer-ish ( Mahivishnu again , ha! ) solo that he still manages to make all his own. This pre-dates Corea's famous later RTF playing here. Over the top? All depends on what your looking for from Yes. Far more busier than what came before it for the most part , but that's just it. This wasn't a continuation from Topographic no more than that album was from Close To The Edge. Each album had been as much an evolution as it was a departure from its predecessor. Simply , by this point , anything new Yes had to offer was all the more removed from prior LPs as the band realized the un-progressive attitude of merely repeating an already proven successful ( read &quot;radio friendly&quot; ) formula ( like &quot;Roundabout&quot; , for example ). Plus , most importantly , they were GROWING as thinkers as well as musicians. Singer Jon Anderson expressed his concern that if the band would go off too much on &quot;figurative licks&quot; , it could end up like a bad Mahivishnu , acknowledgingly not only that band's fusion influence especially on part of Relayer but also stating that   Yes had to keep hold the harmonies or risk losing what made them stand out in the first place: melody. Relayer expands what they had begun on their first album to seemingly absolute reasonable limits. Even to the breaking point at times , such is the fervent , forward-thinking attitude that shaped this classic hybrid of God knows what. Its not what they knew , its what they felt. Anderson's increasingly pointed lyrics make this plenty clear enough , &quot;Stand and fight we do consider , reminded of an inner pact that's seen as we go...&quot; By the way , I wrote a review of Topographic under the name froglight.
0743424425|5.0|This book was so good (and yes I have read all 700 or so pages of this complex thriller)  The author writes with a distinctive style and describes things to perfection.  His characters are extremely well developed, and he manages to make the fine line between hating the &quot;bad guy&quot; (Jack Torrance) and feeling compulsion for him.  It's one of those books that you can't put down until you find out what happens in the end - and you're not disappointed.  I also saw the movie - it was a lot different but REALLY creepy, and the ABC Channel 7 three part miniseries is in the middle of the story right now and it's a much more accurate portrayal of the book (it actually has the hedge animals).  This is an excellent summer vacation book or something to take on long airplane trips.  Just don't miss out.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Admittedly, this album is no Soft Bulletin, but it is still light years better than anything else out there on the market right now. if you are at all curious, just buy it. There are three reasons I wrote this review. First and foremost, no one has mentioned 'Are You A Hypnotist' in their reviews? How about the drum and bass (NOT D'N'B, mind you) exchange at the beginning of that song? How about the confused resignation in Wayne's voice? That song, in my opinion, is reason enough for buying this CD. Secondly, you NEED to listen to this, as with all other Lips' stuff, with HEADPHONES at least once. Myself, I prefer it on headphones. Thirdly, as someone who has been creating artistically for a number of years now, I can honestly say that electronic music does not program itself (well, actually, some does, but you have to actually sit down and write programs to set parameters for that), and that if someone just sat down at a computer with Logic, or Cubase, or Reason, or just Acid on it, sure, you could come up with some noises and what not after playing around. But, using the presets and all would make it repetitive, monotonous, and ultimately boring. In my opinion, none of the electronics on the Lips' records sound like Wayne or someone just sat down and punched some buttons.<br />By the by, in an interview, Wayne tossed out the fact that their drummer has been fighting an addiction to heroin, so good luck to him!
B00005BCOL|2.0|I got this at the library and watched it, and it was sort of strange,to see just women and narry a man in sight! And none of these women were real women in my opinion, they were catty, gossipy, busybodies that were annoying...I wouldn't want any of these women for my friend, and what man would want one of these women? Except for Norma, of course. She was the only character who made the film worth watching. This film was worth a one-time watch, but I doubt I will ever watch it again. You just need a man in a movie, in my opinion. The credits were clever in that the women were each likened to an animal that represented their personality and character. I found it a plus to this movie. If you want to see an example of a very strange movie, or if you want to see how horrible this world would be without men, give this movie a try.
0380820846|1.0|I've enjoyed other books by Julia Quinn, and was excited to buy this. I normally can read a book like this in one sitting. It has been a week now and I just can't seem to care about anyone in this story. Sorry save your money and go buy an old book by Mary Stewart!
B000000186|5.0|&quot;Straight Up&quot; may be one of the most underrated albums in rock.  From FM radio classics &quot;Baby Blue&quot; and &quot;Day After Day,&quot; to the haunting gem &quot;Name of the Game,&quot; this is British power pop at its best.  There's not a bad song on the disc, and the production talents of George Harrison and Todd Rundgren bring out the best of the band's sound.  Pick up a &quot;greatest hits&quot; package if you must, but &quot;Straight Up&quot; is essential listening for any fan of Badfinger, '70s power pop, or British rock.  A masterpiece!
B000001GBJ|5.0|At times you may sense you're being serenaded by strolling musicians. This music has a heavy sentimental streak, perhaps by something as lovely as &quot;Gregorian-like chants and tune. The style is European and very heart touching. A must for your collection.

B000068PQ0|5.0|I want to give 5 stars to that review by &quot;A music fan from jackson hole, WY&quot; entitled &quot;unbelievable letdown.&quot;  Scroll down and click on &quot;Read All Customer Reviews&quot; to read it.  If you like this album, you'll love the review.<br />Personally, The Soft Bulletin is one of (or maybe just plain is) my favorite album(s) of all time.  That said, it has taken me a few listens to catch on to Yoshimi.  While &quot;Fight Test&quot; hooked me on the first listen, the rest of the album took a few tries and a good set of headphones at home (rather than my discman on the subway) before I could appreciate its subtle and bountiful beauties.  <br />I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet, but I could see Yoshimi &quot;battling&quot; The Soft Bulletin for &quot;favorite&quot; status one day.  I think note for note, it just may be a more solid piece of work.  &quot;Everything in the right place&quot; on this one, mirobert.
B000056JYB|5.0|&quot;Blind Faith&quot; has sparked a lot of controversy (and not just because of the album cover) - but I'm not sure why.  The group's only weak spot was drummer Ginger Baker, who reportedly invited himself into the band.  His ponderous, leaden drumming technique drags the rest of the group down slightly, and (like any Ginger Baker recording) there's the obligatory drum solo.  Ginger Baker notwithstanding, though, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; is still a classic album of the period.  The collaboration of Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton merged the best of Traffic's progressive, eclectic jazz- and folk-rock with the best of Cream's British blues.  It's a shame that one of them didn't have the balls to ignore the critics, kick Baker out of the group, and keep the great music going.<br />This &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; is a must-have for any Winwood or Clapton completist.  Other than &quot;Sleeping in the Ground,&quot; there are no long-lost songs - only a series of long jam sessions.  Remarkably, though, these jams are very listenable.  They're the equal of Derek &amp; the Dominoes jams or the final third of George Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; - and drum solos are mercifully kept to a minimum.<br />A nice timepiece for a classic but ill-fated band.
0743216385|5.0|I like the works of Stephen Ambrose.  While I cannot say this is one of his best, it nevertheless is most excellent!  HBO made a very nice mini-series of this book and it was one of the few mini-series or &quot;movies&quot; that HBO did not entirely screw up.  The book is well written, well presented and does credit to the men of which  the story is about.  I can highly recommend this book.  It is written with compassion and understanding.

B000002U82|5.0|This is a masterpiece of rock that will probably be printed for another 50 years or so, given the current rate of popularity decay, and assuming the modern world will still exist.<br /><br />This album's highest billboard hit was Money, which only hit like #13 in the US back in 1974.  However, it stayed in the Billboard Top 100 for over 100 months, usually wavering in the 70s range.  It's still one of the top ten CDs ever, originally printed in 1984 and remaining a must-have for audiophiles with new CD players, as well each generation of heads around the world from 1973 to 2002 and beyond.<br /><br />I've listened to this album for about five years over and over and over and still I pick up new sounds, and new sensations generated by the music.  This is the type of album with which you can sit down in a dark room and play it on a good stereo and just absorb the music, suck it right in.  Purely awesome.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this album is that you can play it with \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" and it'll match up like you're watching a long video.  Here's how to do it: start playing The Wizard of Oz.  At the end of the MGM Lion's third roar, hit play on the Dark Side of the Moon CD.  Soon, you will be amazed by the timing of the music and the motion on the screen.  After watching them together, you won't be able to think of one without the other.  I bought a second DVD/CD player just for this effect.<br /><br />Interestingly, the special edition of this CD that came out some years ago had Dorothy and her friends going down the yellow brick road on the back cover art of the CD.<br /><br />Anyway, listen and learn!<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00005TT77|5.0|Unable to use the Beatles' original recordings for legal reasons, the producers of &quot;I Am Sam&quot; enlisted a stellar lineup of contemporary artists to cover them instead.  That inauspicious start resulted in one of the best soundtracks in recent memory, and perhaps the finest tribute album ever recorded.<br />The real strength of this album - as might be expected - is the song selection.  While the Lennon/McCartney library is one of the best in pop and rock, &quot;I Am Sam&quot; includes only those Beatle tunes that are truly timeless and intelligent songwriting, and whose strength is intrinsic to the song itself (lyrics, melody, structure), rather than the Beatles' performance or George Martin's studio wizardry.  (The only exceptions are &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; by Ben Harper and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; by the Black Crowes, which sound out of place.)  As a result, the covers of &quot;Two of Us,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,&quot; and &quot;Julia&quot; are almost as strong as the originals.<br />Furthermore, the performances here are careful to be largely faithful to the originals.  As a result, these versions breathe new life into the Beatles' classics, while still reverently retaining their original beauty.<br />&quot;I Am Sam&quot; is a musical triumph.
0553274503|5.0|I didn't read this in highschool when most people were introduced to it.  I'm glad I didn't because I don't think I would have appreciated the book.  I knew nothing about the book, so it wasn't tainted by what other people may have thought.<br />This book was wonderful.  There were so many times I felt sorry for Charlie when he was working at the bakery.  But then he became rather arrogant and my opinion of him changed.  This story has a lot of truth to it.  People who are mentally retarded are often looked down on as if they are not human.<br />So, to all of you who didn't read this in highschool or just haven't bothered to read it, I highly recommend you do.
B000008LOV|5.0|The Traveling Wilburys have almost too much talent for one album.  The overall sound suggests that George Harrison was the musical leader of this all-star group, and he turns in his best effort since &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot;  Roy Orbison's contributions, although minor, are a true pleasure, and Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne do a nice job of supporting Harrison's lead.  If anything, Bob Dylan is an unnecessary distraction.<br />&quot;Volume One&quot; is simply one of the best albums of the 1980s, and should stand as a timeless classic - if only someone would get it back in print!
B000056K04|5.0|I know most of the hardcore DMB fans criticize this cd, but for me this was the cd that finally got me into the band. There was just something about Dave's screw the world attitude on &quot;I Did It&quot; that drew me in. I couldn't resist listening to more. &quot;When the World Ends&quot; is another edgy song on the album, &quot;The Space Between&quot; is a beautiful song, &quot;Everyday&quot; is a little different from most of the songs on the cd because it's more positive and upbeat, but I love it. Some of my other favorites are &quot;If I Had is all,&quot; &quot;Fool to Think,&quot; and &quot;Mother Father.&quot; The one problem I can see is the cd doesn't fully use the talents of the other members of the band, but it's still a five star album.
B00004XQ83|5.0|So much has already been written about \\"O Brother\\" and its live companion release \\"Down from the Mountain,\\" and it's difficult to pin down what exactly made them so popular - and so good.  But I think it really comes down to two things:<br />First, variety.  \\"O Brother\\" and \\"Down from the Mountain\\" cover almost every branch and tributary of early American music (besides jazz).  In contrast to many of the \\"O Brother\\" copycats, the selections aren't just country, and they aren't just bluegrass.  Instead, they run the early American gamut from folk, to bluegrass, to country, to gospel, to blues.<br />Second, modern production values.  Most of the \\"original\\" versions of these songs were recorded by semi-professional musicians on primitive recording equipment.  As a result, they don't generally have the clarity, warmth, and richness of these reverent updates.<br />But, whatever the reason, \\"O Brother\\" and \\"Down from the Mountain\\" will remain a treasured part of my collection.  Every American should hear these masterpieces.

B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver\\" often get more critical acclaim, but \\"Abbey Road\\" is the Beatles' true masterpiece.  The first half features some of the group's hardest (and most convincing) rock - the classic \\"Come Together\\" and the lost prog-rock gem \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy).\\"  Ringo Starr contributes the good-natured \\"Yellow Submarine\\" sequel \\"Octopus' Garden.\\"  George Harrison's talents reach their full potential on his most beautiful compositions, \\"Something\\" and \\"Here Comes the Sun.\\"  And I haven't even mentioned the best part:  Paul McCartney's musical patchwork quilt-cum-masterpiece on side two, which may be rock music's most convincing answer to the classical symphony.  The \\"Golden Slumbers\\" medley alone may be the most moving composition  of the modern era.  And, if that wasn't enough, it's all packaged with arguably the best album cover ever.<br />But my meager descriptions can't possibly do this recording justice.  For a band about to break up, the consistent quality of this album is truly astounding.  And, without \\"Abbey Road,\\" I don't think the Beatles would have the musical and cultural legacy they have today.  It represents the best of what rock was and what rock can be.
B000056V73|2.0|What a lousy film. I was looking forward to it. It had an unwelcome &quot;the-anger-of-ugly-people&quot; plot. Who cares?  But the good looking people didn't even have any charisma at all. Billy Crudup is DULL. I was appalled when this script won an Oscar. I thought it was tired and boring and I was wishing the plane would crash in the plane-almost-crashing scene, because at least then the movie would have ENDED.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I've never seen the original, so I don't have a basis with which to judge this as a remake, which, in hindsight, is probably better, since I didn't give a second thought to &quot;comparing&quot;.  Having seen it for the movie it is though, I've got to say I enjoyed it, and had no problem staying captivated throughout the 3 hours.  And, if I may be honest, there were several moments that brought upon me that old lump-in-the-throat feeling, accompanied by watery eyes, (which can be difficult to induce in your standard 20 year old male, being the sometimes seemingly de-sensitized group that we are).  Anyways, rent or buy the movie, sit down with any significant others, and enjoy a good story.
B000003C2S|5.0|THIS CD is great, own today!
B000002N3J|4.0|This features all her top ten hits that are slower of nature.  So if you're looking for any dance songs on this album you won't find any.  This is her second greatest hits because they are all previously released material not GHV2.  This is a good collection but most of these songs were released just on other albums the only song that wasn't was &quot;This Use To Be My Playground&quot;.  I recommend this album.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I have seen Spider-Man four times since it has bin released and I must say it rocks! It is one of the best movies I have seen all summer. Sam Rami dose a wonderful directing job, Toby Maguire delivers a great acting performance as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. The story line follows the comics, and the charector follow that of the comics. I must admit, I have not always bin a \\"Spidey\\" fan, but since I have seen the movie I now know the origan of Spider-Man and how his adventures startd! Spider-Man is a must see movie!!!!
B00005QGAX|5.0|This album is definitly better than Thriller because this album features five Number One Singles.  Unlike Thriller the songs on this album have aged well with time.  The Song highlights are &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;,&quot;Another Part of Me&quot;,&quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, and &quot;The Man In The Mirrror&quot;.  this album is a listen all the way through, there is no filler in this album.  Released in 1987 this album was 1 for 6 weeks not good for him because his previous album was 1 for 37 weeks.  it did sell 8 million so not that bad.  I recommend this album.
0151008116|5.0|I'm an avid reader, usually a book per week, and this book is the best I've read in the past year, maybe longer.  It is brilliantly imagined, impeccably written, whimsical, funny and thougtful all at once.  There's always a danger in building a book up too much for other readers, so I'll just say this:  this book reminded me why I read and what fiction is supposed to do for us.  I was SMILING as I read it. <br />I agree with the below reviewer that the &quot;believe in God&quot; promise isn't quite delivered on, but that didn't compromise the book for me. The book made me believe in the power of storytelling, which goes a very long way on a rainy day.<br />Buy it in hardback.  I'd bet good money this will be one day be considered a classic.
B00005QGAV|3.0|This is a good album but michael tried to much to be like Thriller instead of just making a good album.  Although &quot;Black Or White&quot; was a really good song and &quot;Remember The Time&quot; was good the rest of the album is just filler and sounds better on video than on the album.  The album debuted at number 1 but only stayed there for 4 weeks and showed Michael jackson could be losing it.  This album is okayt but I wouldn't buy it.
0380977788|4.0|I note that Amazon lists \\"reading level 9-12\\" for Neil Gaiman's newest book, while the New York Times Book Review currently carries an ad for it proclaiming \\"for all ages.\\"  In the sense that fantasies like \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" are for all ages, that enticement is valid.<br />Gaiman writes a clean, flowing narrative, in a style in which each word is carefully chosen.  Although the book could be frightening, it will certainly appeal to younger readers. In true fantasy style, anything can happen, any character can appear/disappear, and surprises lurk everywhere.  As a reader not particularly fond of this sci-fi fantasy mode, I was not enthralled by \\"Coraline\\", but I cannot fault Gaiman's  ability as an exceptionally good writer.
B000002LND|3.0|This album is missing a lot of songs and some songs that were top ten songs.  The songs missing are &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Everybody&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Who's That Girl?&quot;, &quot;Causing A Commotion&quot; and probably many other songs that I forgot right now.  i think this is a very incomplete album.  I thought GHV2 would release those songs but it didn't either.  Will they ever release these songs on a greatest hits CD?
0140186409|5.0|John Steinbeck, in my opinion, is probably the most talented author I have ever read.  His descriptions are awe-inspiring, his narration unique, and his stories are emotional rollercoasters.  I found myself, while reading 'The Grapes', at all times either laughing, crying, or just plain ticked off.  In this novel is portrayed one of the saddest, yet least know tradgedies in our countries history.  The story of farmers kicked out of their homes, forced to a strange land and despised, cheated, and starved when they arrived reminded me of medievil times but the sad fact is it happened while our grandparents were growing up.  I admit I was not proud of America as I read this book!  But it is oh so important of a read because if it can happen 50 years ago it can happen today, and only by learning from history can we avoid these same mistakes.<br />But despite the feelings you may have while consuming this book please do not avoid it, for it is a must read.  If you have somehow made it past high school without having read this one, then why not do it now.  It is probably the best book I have read by an American author and too important to pass up.  I don't guarantee you will happily enjoy it but I do guarantee you will be better for having read it!
B000002U6E|3.0|If the guy didn't sing the CD would be perfect! His voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard,  but the rest of the songs he isn't in are great! Nothing is as good as MCMXC A.D. !! But this one is worth buying used. It still has some good songs on it.
B0000004F9|5.0|Soft Machine were actually friends of Pink Floyd and played with them on double bills many times. Admired by Hendrix when Hendrix came to England, he had them open for him on his first headlining U.S. tour. Friends of mine who saw them reported that Hendrix was OK, but Soft Machine was amazing.<BR>I actually heard these two albums back about 1971, after I heard Third--Third was (and is) a phenomenal lp, holding a place in the Soft Machine catalogue close to that of Ummagumma by Pink Floyd. It was the summation of both bands' early heavily experimentational periods, and the point at which both began to formularize their sound; both groups put out two more interesting albums but eventually succumbed to repetition/commercialism in 1974. (In the case of Soft Machine, they never pulled off a &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;).<br />Even from their early releases, the Soft Machine were virtuosic musicians in the world of rock. Ratledge's keyboard chops were as good as -- or better than -- his most accomplished contemporaries, Keith Emerson and Brian Auger, and he is the ONLY rock keyboard player who pulled off bringing the most advanced free jazz concepts (Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman) to rock, particularly on the first album. As a keyboard player, some of the things on both albums, such as &quot;Hope for Happiness&quot;, &quot;So Boot if At All&quot;, &quot;Lullabye Letter&quot;, &quot;Hibou, Anemone and Bear&quot;, &quot;As Long As He Lies Perfectly Still&quot; are incredibly complicated and innovative keyboard pieces and among the reasons I still admire Ratledge thirty years later. (Ratledge's organ sound changes quite radically from the first album to the second, probably because of the amplification they were using. On the first U.S. tour, Soft Machine used Fender Dual Showman amplifiers--pretty hefty power output, but very clean sounding. Later they switched to Marshall amps, which had more power but also more distortion; they were favorites of everone f  Wyatt's drumming is as good as Keith Moon's, but he knows what he is doing. Although Kevin Ayers' bass playing on the first is not quite as proficient as Hugh Hopper's on the second, Hopper was one of the finest bass players in rock; totally unique and lightning fast, so Ayers did a creditable job (especially on &quot;Joy of a Toy&quot; on the first lp).<br />This was a staggeringly good group...great but very odd. But, as one of my friends had said once, both albums are like one &quot;great long song.&quot; You should really hear this, if only to hear what really great musicians can do when the fetters are untied. This was such a brief and shining moment in rock history...I am delighted that it was at least captured on vinyl.<br />Get it...this is a piece of magic captured in a jewel box.<br />Gary Gomes
0316666343|3.0|The novel takes off from an interesting concept -- a teenage girl who has been murdered watches her family and friends from her own private heaven -- but it is a very flat read.  The author does little but recount the movements of those on earth.  The characters are never fully developed, the tensions not fully portrayed, and at times I found myself flipping through the pages to get to the end.  There is a lot of potential here that does untouched.  It's an okay book, but certainly falls far short of the tremendous buzz it has received.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Man, I have several Maiden albums but this is one of my favs. It's just awesome. Sure, sometimes it can be a little repetetive but many classic Maiden songs are repetetive and no one says anything about them, now do they? Anyway, the lyrics are great and thought out pretty well. Blood Brothers has to be one of my favorite songs of all time. This album is produced very very good and it has a very live feel to it. There is such a feel and vibe to the album that I just can't explain. This cd just flows so well from track to track. Some of my favorite Maiden songs are on this cd. The Thin Line Between Love And Hate is just amazing. <br />Bruce's voice can still get super high pitched. Yeah, it doesn't sound like it did in Number Of The Beast but the guy has aged. People get older and their voice does too. But, like I said, he can still get up there but now his voice has a nice edge to it.<br />This cd is heavy but crunchy, the guitar tones are very similar to somewhere in time or seventh son of a seventh song.  In fact, if you like those two albums then i'll say you'll like this one too, the same feel and everything.  <br />The only problem with this cd is the bass. It's there and but it isn't prominent like on their other albums.<br />All in all, this is one great album and I highly suggest buying this.  This is, without a doubt, in my top 5 favorite maiden albums...
B0000640VO|2.0|Yes the visual style is interesting though overdone but far more time was spent on the look of the film than the actual content. I'm not so sure what is charming about Amelie or her eventual relationship with the porn shop worker, the bad comedy about Princess Di or sneaking into someone's house and making them go insane - the director spent so much time trying to make everyone &quot;quirky&quot; that they are just caricatures.
B00003CXXP|4.0|When you consider the fact that this movie has generated over 980 reviews; it can be deduced that Spielberg has crafted a film truly worthy of Kubrick's name. You may hate it, you may love it, you may compose a page worth of ALL CAPs commentary about it, but you won't be able to ignore it. It's quite refreshing to know that at least 980 people were able to pay attention for 145 minutes watching a movie that contains no nudity. For that I have to give Spielberg credit, since even Kubrick couldn't manage to maintain viewer interest without the occasion breast cameo.<br />Since the purpose of a review is summation and judgement, I'll be brief and try to give the reader a basis for either enjoying this movie on their own, or waiting till it's forced on them during a plane flight.<br />In short, the main focus is love; or more correctly the concept of being able to love forever and ever.<br />The story follows the robot David (Haley Joel Osment) as he attempts to regain the love of his mother (Frances O'Connor), to whom he has been forever imprinted.<br />David is the experiment of his creator (William Hurt), who creates a robot capable of love to determine if humans can return that love. The film's environment is a world slowly freezing from an apparent lack of love. Humans have become so technological that they have forgotten how to love themselves, each other, and their own planet. Children are raised with robot companions to love, while sex robots provide an artificial cyber-love for adults. The next step is a robot child who can be electronically imprinted to \\"love\\" his mother. David's mother returns his love at first, but that love fades when her biological son returns home. It's roughly the same situation of the family pet after the children are born, and Rover is no longer tolerated in the house.<br />Since David's imprinting is not reversible, his love can only be terminated by total disassembly or a complete discharge of his batteries (which can take a thousandyears, more or less, your mileage may vary). Rather than face the hard reality of David's destruction, Mom decides to set David free in the wilderness.<br />This begins Act II, where David wanders through a Kubrick-colored world as Spielberg attempts to translate his dead friend's message to today's comatose audience. We meet cast off robots, who wander the planet hiding from humans while attempting to maintain their failing mechanical bodies. We also meet the Flesh Fair, a nomadic sideshow where discarded robots are tortured and destroyed. Like ancient primitives sacrificing their animals, the Flesh Fair leaders seek to \\"save\\" the human race with their barbaric actions. While visually entertaining, this episode loses a lot to Spielberg's translation, becoming no more than a fiery Klan meeting with PT Barnum as the ringleader. David is befriended by Joe (Jude Law), a sex robot, who attempts to help him in his quest. Joe leads David to Rouge City (Spielberg's neon homage to Kubrick), where clues ultimately lead David back to his creator. In the end David is frozen, as his loveless world grows too cold to support his artificial body.<br /><br />With that, the Kubrick ends, and out pops Spielberg for the big sloppy finish. Future robots thaw David, recharge him, and give him one last day with mother. Not surprisingly, mom professes her enduring love for David. But, given that she only exists for one day, it's a Pyric victory for our hero. As his mom dies, David realizes that his quest for eternal love has ended, and he quietly shuts himself down.<br />In my opinion, this film is a serene river that hides a brutal undercurrent. Spielberg's sugar sweet coating blends with Kubrick's knife sharp sarcasm in an occasionally unsettling manner. The transitions between scenes are turbulent, and often characters disappear with no explanation. The film's depiction of violence can be summed up using the Mafia analogy \\"Death often comes from men with smiling faces\\".<br />If you dislike Spielberg or Kubrick, then you will hate this movie. Or conversely, if you idolize either filmmaker, then you may also dislike this film. The concepts and emotions can be difficult to digest, and often leave more questions than answers. In short, I recommend you view it in order to formulate your own opinion. Don't be swayed by the negative or positive reviews. This film will effect some sort of emotional response from everyone who takes the time to properly explore it. It is through discussion of these emotions that we ultimately begin to understand and develop compassion for others and ourselves.  As for love, well according to this story, it happens, but not forever.
B000066AXE|3.0|It's hard to fault &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; for the performances or, for that matter, the direction.  Crowe and Connelly are superb, and believable, as the brain-sick mathemetician and his long-suffering wife.  The film does move along with nice pacing and it's not an effort to become emotionally involved in their lives.  Frankly, where the film fails are those scenes that depart from their relationship and bring us closer to the film's namesake, the so-called &quot;Beautiful Mind&quot; of John Nash.<br />Frankly, neither John Nash, nor his mind, are in the tiniest sense made &quot;beautiful&quot; by this film.  The man, an eccentric genius laid low by paranoid schizophrenia, is sympathetic only in the sense that one might feel sympathy for anyone who is mentally ill.  Sure, it's sort of interesting that he eventually won the Nobel Prize Winner for his mathematic theories but when the film tries to explain those theories, the viewer gets only the most rudimentary insight into what must really be a fascinating, somehow mathematically based, theory of economics and human nature.  Naturally, the script writers assumed that most viewers wouldn't be interested in anything more than third grade arithmetic, and leave it to Nash to scribble heiroglyphic equations on windows, blackboards, and anything else he gets his hands on to show how &quot;complex&quot; his theories must be without really attempting to explain how they work.<br />The same holds true for his mental disease.  Most psychiatrists attribute the development of severe mental illness, such as paranoid schizophrenia, to a combination of genetic (family history) and environmental (infant/childhood trauma) factors.  This film discloses nothing about this man's life prior to graduate school.  He simply acquires his mental illness without any explanation, whatsoever.  The audience is supposed to swoon with sympathy for his plight and, in fact, based on the film's box office (and the Academy), apparently, a lot of folks apparently found Crowe's performance affecting.  Indeed, it is to Crowe's everlasting credit that he made the character he played into someone to whom audiences could relate.<br />Once again, though, one is left wanting to know more.  Why did Nash create the imaginary characters that populate his diseased mind?  One can, given the times (mid 1950's) imagine why an anti-communist operative (played wonderfully by Ed Harris) is one of his spectres, but why the gregarious room-mate, and (especially) why the room-mate's young adoptive daughter?  What in Nash's past, if anything, prompt these denizens to constantly plague his life?  No clue is given.<br />I suppose the real goals of this film were: (i) show what it really &quot;must be like&quot; to be trapped in a paranoid delusion, and (ii) avoid being to be too much like a documentary on Nash's life.  In other words, &quot;entertainment&quot; - not insight - was the operative goal.  But haven't we all been down this road at least two dozen times?  From the manipulative recent (and decent) &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; all the way back to Boris Karloff, we've all been duped by Hollywood trickery into believing one set of assumptions until a dopey mutt pulls the curtain and reveals the Wizard to be an old putz.  It's the same with this film: is he a schizo, or isn't he?  Of course, this film is based on a real guy so you have to assume he IS a schizo from scene one.  Still, we audiences love getting that curtain pulled.  Sad, isn't it, that the Academy, and the American public, still gape over the same recycled bilge.  Gosh, now I know what it REALLY must be like to be paranoid.  These crazy M.O.'s really BELIEVE their delusions!  For a awhile there, even I believed it!  Whoah!<br />In other words, this movie is pure HOLLWOOD.  Take it for what it is.<br />OK, &quot;A Beatiful Mind&quot; is a beautifully filmed and scored movie, and the performances are truly solid.  What fails is the script, which relies on the same,tired Hollywood formula and truly fails to inform us in any meaningful way about John Nash, his theories, or his demons.tired Hollywood formula and truly fails to inform us in any meaningful way about John Nash, his theories, or his demons.

B000065U1N|1.0|Heard a quote recently, from a young woman enlisted in the U.S. armed forces. \\"I didn't join the army thinking I'd go to war.\\" And that sums up the subject matter of BLACK HAWK DOWN perfectly.<br />These are not soldiers, not as so recently portrayed in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. For the most part they stand around as targets, awaiting rescue (refreshingly; this sort of inaction is usually reserved for women's roles) or instructions from on-high before taking a step, preferring having body parts pure&eacute;d to thinking or taking responsibility for their own survival. Foul-up compounds foul-up. And for what?<br />Sympathy for most of the characters is hard to come by. Maybe they're doing time in lieu of paying for college or simply have no clue of their life's direction. That's not uncommon and no condemnation, truly. But it's surely a disclaimer anyone considering the armed forces should heed: We reserve the right to fold, spindle, and mutilate your very flesh; no glorious or noble sacrifice assured.<br />Again, this is a sparkling production, lovely to behold were it more fictitious. The challenge of criticizing a film like this are thoughts for those who survived or survived those who didn't. The only hope in this film is that maybe -- maybe -- their horror and their loss won't be repeated.

B000059PQQ|3.0|Candy is a mad movie and, after all these years, it is still a hoot! I'm not sure of its appeal to anyone under the age of 40, but for the 60's generation it truly is a swing down memory lane.<br />The film was considered outrageous in its day but it seems pretty tame by \\"modern' standards. Ringo Starr received good reviews when the movie was released but in retrospect his performance is almost embarrassingly poor. But the incongruous cameos by a few of the biggest stars of the day are a great part of the film's appeal. (Remember, this was one of the first \\"X\\" rated films to be seen in wide release and, goodness, there were FAMOUS people involved!)<br />Sir Richard Burton is riotous as are Marlon Brando, Walter Matthau and James Coburn, but the cohesive bond in the whole plot is the dual performance by John Astin who portrays Candy's stuffed-shirt father as well as her lecherous uncle, Jack. And, not too surprisingly, Ewa Aulin is still ravenously beautiful as the naive nymphet, Candy!<br />Another shining attribute is Dave Grusin's soundtrack, very 60's, no doubt, but in the end it actually holds up better than film. Songs and incidental pieces by The Byrds and Steppinwolf sound fresh and invigorating.<br />Younger people who want to experience a glimpse of the 60's \\"counter-culture\\" would do well to start with this trifling sweet, Candy!
B00005JKNF|3.0|This was supposed to be a whodonit with some kind of twist.  Instead, it was a slow movie about a bunch of fartsy aristocrats having shallow conversation.  And all those servants! To its credit, the movie has a good setting and good costumes.  The plot, however, is less interesting than one expects from a whodonit. Looks like this movie won or was nominated for an Oscar... Maybe for the &quot;artistic&quot; value this film deserved it, but certainly not for the entertainment value.
B0000542D2|5.0|I was thirteen or fourteen years old when I first watched A HARD DAY'S NIGHT...<br />Richard Lester's choice of black and white might have been less of a stroke of genius than a simple budgetary consideration. Be that as it may, it accounts for a great deal of the films ambiance. The Beatles proved to be acting naturals and the rest of the supporting cast were seasoned professionals, albeit better known in the U.K. than in the States.<br />But it is Lester's use of light that is the films crowning achievement. Harkening back to the classics of the 1930's, virtually every shot is specifically lit and stands on it's own as an exhibit grade still photograph.<br />The music is the icing on the cake and the way the songs are presented, sometimes as a performance piece (\\"IF I FELL\\") and other times as soundtrack (\\"CAN'T BUY ME LOVE\\") is noting short of brilliantly innovative.<br />I've loaned this film out to umpteen friends and they always say that it cuts directly across generations and that their kids become instant fans of the Beatles. Buy it. It bears repeated viewings.

B00005B36H|5.0|Tool is a band that keeps getting better and better, just when you think they've reached their high point. As soon as it seems they can't improve anymore, an album more hypnotizing and amazing makes its presence known. Tool's superiority, maturity, and integrity over other &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;metal&quot; bands of these days is what keeps them so high above the norm, locking your senses into an amazing trance-like state, instead of just &quot;rocking out&quot; as one reviewer put it. Whether you're being blasted by the bands superb instrumentation or hypnotized by one of their chilling and disturbing videos, Tool is obviously not your average band, as they defy all artistic labels and genre barriers, all without combining musical brands into tasteless combinations (rap/rock, nu-metal).<br />Most notably, the already mind-blowing instrumentation of AEnima has evolved even more on &quot;Lateralus&quot;. Adam Jones' guitar playing has grown from rhythmic and crunching power chords into mind-bending riffs and solos, making equal use of a clean guitar as well as the power of distortion this time around, all of which twists and bends around Justin Chancellors rhythmic bass lines which so closely resemble guitar. Danny Carey essentially runs circles around just about every other drummer out at the moment, and Maynard James Keenan's vocals rise above all other vocalists, pulling off screams and beautiful vocal lines that seem physically impossible (listen to his 30 second scream in &quot;The Grudge&quot;).<br />Most fans of Tool will notice that instead of having the edge on them such as on &quot;Undertow&quot;, or the &quot;think for yourself&quot; vibe that AEnima had, &quot;Lateralus&quot; actually incorporates a &quot;think differently&quot; message. But in standard Tool style, none of the songs are easy to decipher and always require an open mind on the listeners part.<br />Every track is virtually amazing and not for the 3 minute pop song fan (those who complainabout the songs being too long are better off sticking with their Puddle Of Mudd album), as Tool has always been a group which believes in getting their ideas and expessions out, no matter how long it takes. As equal and necessary as every song is, standouts for me are &quot;The Grudge&quot;, &quot;Parabola&quot;, &quot;Ticks And Leeches&quot;, and &quot;Triad&quot;, not to mention the eerie &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;. Definitely THE best album of 2001. Don't miss it.
B00004XQ83|1.0|I was really disappointed in this album, because I really liked the music in the movie. The best track was McClintock's original 1928 version of 'Big Rock Candy Mountain', but I would have been much happier buying a Dr. Demento collection with that on it. The 'Nobody But the Baby' track sung by the sirens seemed better mixed in the movie, which made it more evocative, and that may have been the problem with 'Man of Constant Sorrow' too.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus, already regarded as a great band, have managed to keep it together and evolve with their excellent new album 'Morning View'. The cd, which was released while their breakthrough single 'Drive' was still climbing the charts, displays Incubus's new found maturity and music chops. Brandon Boyd's vocals are a bit whiny but compliment the music nicely, Mike's guitar is shimmering and while ultimately simple, is still interesting and *applauds* Einziger has really found his voice on the instrument! The rhythm section is a thumbs up, and while I don't tend to really enjoy a dj as part of a rock lineup, kilmore manages to add great effects to the overall sound and vibe of the record.
B00004XONN|4.0|Once you understand the mindset Radiohead were in when they wrote Kid A, it begins to make a lot more sense. They had just finished up their exhausting OK Computer tour, were still learning to deal with their new-found (and not always welcome) rock-god status, and were under the overwhelming pressure of the entire music industry to TOP OK Computer, the greatest rock album to come out in the last 20 years. It was a dark and difficult time for them. <BR>Enter Kid A.<BR>Kid A is a very dark and difficult album. Veiled in shadows and mystery, it takes some time to penetrate. It sounds unlike anything Radiohead has ever done before. Standouts include the very futuristic and mysterious title track; the chaotic jazz-band, rock-out, Times-Square-in-a-traffic-jam-sounding &quot;The National Anthem;&quot; the pathetically beautiful &quot;How to Disappear Completely;&quot;the mock-techno &quot;Idioteque;&quot; and the organ-and-harp-laced &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack.&quot; <BR>Kid A is an album to listen to when you are exhausted, overwhelmed, beaten down by life, and you feel like you just can't take anymore. When you are in the proper mindset, you realize its true beauty.<BR>There is one particular story that I believe expresses the mood of Kid A better than anything I could write. On the OK Computer tour, Thom Yorke was having an especially difficult time coping with his new superstar status and the media attention that comes with it as well as the constant touring and performing. He asked his friend Michael Stipe, lead singer of REM, for help. Stipe told him, &quot;Go into your room, close the door, draw the shades, and repeat to yourself,'I'm not here. This isn't happening.'&quot; Yorke used this experience as the inspiration for one of the most beautiful songs on the album, &quot;How to Disappear Completely (And Never Be Found).&quot;<BR>Sometimes you just need to disappear. And there's nothing better than Kid A to help you do it.
B00000254Q|3.0|There are some very fine songs on this album. Unfortunately, they are mixed in with some of the weaker songs Sanatana has ever released. The album starts out with the classic Dance Sister Dance, which has a great melody, good vocal, and fantastic guitar solo. The band is very hot on this tune, and it delivers on the promise of making you want to stand up and dance. The second song, an instrumental, is also very fine, particular near the end when the band cools down a few notches and moves into a skating jazz groove that creates a kind of euphoric high in this listener. The third song, Let Me, starts out with a 5 star rating performance from the rhythm section. The guitar comes in, and the quality drops to a 4, which is still very good. The rest of the band joins and the tune finds its cliche groove, which is about a 3 quality. Then the vocals start and the song drops to a 2. The vocals sound to me like a cliche ridden attempt to imitate James Brown or Sly Stone. Or maybe to imitate their imitators. It ends up being a clunker. Gitano starts with a pretentious and poorly executed flaminco guitar solor including lots of buzzing guitar strings. But the tune itself is hot and contains some great vocals, great melody, and a great beat. It's very interesting to hear how Carlos' guitar playing improves the moment the song finds its groove. The guy is fantastic when he has a good groove, which is what Santana is all about. Tell Me Are You Tired is so bad I can no longer listened to it all the way through. Europa is fantastic, a classic Santana soaring guitar melody and solo. Tom Costers' organ is not up to Carlos's guitar solo, but all in all it is a classic cut, among his best. I don't think I've ever made it all the way through the...melody of Let It Shine... It might work live if you were in a really, really good mood, but overall it is just too silly even for this lover of Santana's euphoric, good groove songs.<br />... If you want to put the album on and listen to it all the way through, you might have some serious regrets about buying it. This is not one of the albums where Carlos falls apart altogether. It has some of his best music on it. It's just that the good is mixed in with some of his worst.l the way through, you might have some serious regrets about buying it.

0609610570|5.0|When a company gets in trouble and the leadership is shown to the door, who does the board of directors look for as a replacement? A leader with a proven track record to EXECUTE. Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan lay out the building blocks for assembling an execution-focused organization in plain language, and supplement their approach with numerous anecdotes. Most, if not all, of their \\"how NOT to manage\\" anecdotes had me shaking my head -- because almost all of us can personally relate them to our own corporate experiences (for example, when the leader sacrifices future performance to make his quarterly numbers or a senior management team agrees that actions need to be taken without assigning concrete actions and accountability). This book is a quick and engaging read, and the book is definitely grounded more in real corporate experiences than in academic theories. The wisdom gained from those corporate experiences returns propriety to the often hollow expression \\"people are our most important asset.\\" Companies who follow the guidelines of \\"Execution\\" know that processes are useless without the right strategies, and strategies are useless without the right people engaged and accountable for executing them.
B000002LCD|2.0|This was the last Madonna album before her songs began to become more serious.  And while I want to say she ended her &quot;fun music&quot; days with a bang, she didn't<br />Who's That Girl-  A very cute and fun song, and her best cut on the album, but it's far from her best.  B<br />Causing A Commotion-  It's just as good as the first track, but for some reason I just don't like it as much.  I just don't really get the song, I suppose.  C+<br />The Look Of Love-  Oh my God.  When I first heard this song, I thought it would NEVER end.  I could barely listen to it.  Not a good slow song by any standards.  D-<br />Can't Stop-  It's better than Causing A Commotion, but it's painfully generic, and it seems like Madonna didn't really seem into it.  B-<br />I never listen to the non-Madonna tracks, so I can't give my opinion on them.  Buy this album when you have all other Madonna albums.  This is not her finest moment.
B0000028RR|1.0|Raging against everything from the American flag to Taco Bell restaurants, it's easy to see where the band gets its name from. Unfortunately, their debut CD doesn't quite live up to the reputation that the group has acquired over the years. Their lyrics and song content are difficult to understand for non-activists (myself included) and the guitar riffs/bass lines aren't that great, either. While the band's sophomore album, Evil Empire, also shares the same fate lyrically, lead singer Zack De La Rocha definitely has more of an artistic flow while the band members managed to create music that sticks in your head. On the debut CD, the only track really worth listening to happens to be \\"Killing In The Name\\" which has received a healthy amount of airplay. Go ahead and skip this one and check out Evil Empire instead.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Okay. So when I first got this cd, I heard last night, and thought the video was genius. I got the cd, and was like wow, thats cool, and put it down for a while. The single for hard to explain came out and i gave the cd another try. I heard it, and had to listen again. and again, and again. This cd is incredible. I listen to it atleast twice a day. Its not that I want to believe its good, it IS that good. I've waited for a band I could love and talk about 24/7, THE STROKES are this band. If there was one cd I'd rather own than burn, just for nostalgic value, IS THIS IT, is definitly it.
B00005Y7OJ|5.0|This album tends to divide PSB fans but for me this is quite possibly their finest hour overall. It combines the beautifully contemplative The Survivors and Before with the over-the-top percussion of Discoteca and Single and the delirious Metamorphosis and A Red Letter Day. The moods swing further than on most of the their albums but it sits together incredibly well as a cohesive whole. As always, great melodies are liberally scattered throughout but they have gone for something different on a number of the arrangements and the closer you listen, the more is revealed. Enjoy.
0395925037|3.0|What can one say. The person responsible for so much misery in the world. Who never contributed a single positive thing to the life of anyone. Why read his book? Well there is more here than meets the eye:<br />1) It is really impossible to understand the historical angnst gnawing at the entrails of a future mass murderer without knowing what motivated him. Hitler is the repository of every hatred and scapegoat idea that ever oppressed the mind of a human being or a nation (see present day Serbia).<br />2) It allows one to look at the future blue-print of destruction for Europe. Although nothing was inevitable about the Holocaust and destruction of European Jewry (until Hitler and his henchmen made it happen), it is amazing how much detail and rough blueprint emerges from his turgid prose. <br />3) It is conspiracy theory par excellance and shows how conspiracy theorists are able to take simple facts and inuendo and then turn them into mass edifices of supposed belief --- it is in fact the very antithesis of logical, scientific thinking. <br />4) It shows how, in extreme form (along with Stalin and Pol Pot et al), how people can be regarded by the leader as theory fodder: eager to advance a grand idea of German domination and racial purity (whatever that is?) ---- willing to pound people into theory and crush the lives of individuals, including women and children, under the wheels of history, all in the name of warped conspiratorial views of the world. <br />5) It is useful as a litmus test in benchmarking populist of today, from Mr. Pym Fortune to Pat Buchanan to Neo nationalists in China, Russia and the new Naziism of Jean Mari LePen. Of course, all are not the same. Some are more malevolent than others, but Mein Kampf offers a test in warped thinking and clearly allows one to make a distinction between the ideas of a populist and those of a megolomaniac. <br />----<br />I have had a copy of this book since I was 11 at my house. Of course I did not know how to interpret it when I was young --- it was a mere book written by an evil man. It is still a mere book written by an Evil Man, but it allows us insight in unmasking Evil and knowing its various guises. Mostly it allows us to judge between when people are engaging in merely shoddy thinking and when their thoughts turn evil.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is a masterpiece.  Green Day has reached the pinnacle of rock and roll.  'Warning' is filled with beautiful melodies, tempo changes, and fun filled lyrics.  Buy the CD and let the fun begin!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This was the album that turned Madonna into a star.  The first album was good, but this is a definite improvement.<br />1.  Material Girl-  One of her signature songs.  Also one of her catchiest, even if it's quintissential 80's  A<br />2.  Angel-  A nice song.  Kinda dumb, but great music and singing.  B+<br />3.  Like A Virgin-  THE signature song.  It is always really fun to listen to, and has the point that even Britney's first didn't.  A<br />4.  Over And Over-  My favorite song on the album.  Definitely made for the clubs, and one you can't help but dance to.  A+<br />5.  Love Don't Live Her Anymore-  Not a song many Madonna fans will like, but I love it.  Her vocals are the best on this song, and a very soulful take.  A-<br />6.  Dress You Up-  A little too dumb, but other than that, it is flawless.  B<br />7.  Shoo-Be-Do-  Perhaps the worst song, even though it's still very nice, and easy to relax to.  B-<br />8.  Pretender-  It's a very good song, but extremely forgettable.  My least favorite song.  C<br />9.  Stay-  A great way to end the album.  The chorus will be in your mind long after the song has stopped playing.  A-<br />This is THE Madonna album to have.  If you don't know which album to get first, get this one.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Alright, I don't tend to sound off and sputter as a result of a review written by some esoteric nerd that spends all day \\"looking for deleted smith singles\\", but I read a review of this disc in MAGNET and it was totally trashed. Ok, does anyone reading this think Andrew WK is out to reinvent anything, or better yet, do anything than make music fun again? I don't see any hands raised. This disc was made to be fun; not to have you ponder over the deep philosophical issues brought about by the lyrics or pull your hair trying to nail down the specific setting of the delay pedal on some tune. Andrew WK is a brillant man. He is making music fun again. Cheesy, sure. Come on and indulge yourself.
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn has become one of my favorite authors, based on her Brigerton series (especially The Duke and I). Her unique voice gives her stories warmth, charm, originality and fun! I also love that her hero and heroines always like each other, and treat each other with respect. I have been looking forward to Colin and Penelope's story and bought it the day it came out. But though the book had moments of wit and charm, I found it to be dissapointing.<br />The book reminded me of Ms. Quinn's earlier novels, which seemed to lack character depth, and were filled with pages and pages of dialogue that, frankly, gets tedious after awhile. The book had touches of Ms. Quinn's sparkle and wit, but something was lacking between Colin and Penelope. <br />Books like The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loved Me had both light humour, as well as deep characterizations and conflict. This book didn't go deep enough to get at the heart of the hero or the heroine's emotions -- Especially Colin's. For example, why did he suddenly have a change of heart about Penelope? Penelope had loved Colin for years from afar, yet her circumstance didn't pull at my heart like it should have. The book, though good, seemed to just skim the surface of its great promise.
B000002UAU|4.0|I decided to take a break from Elton John for awhile and listen to another band. My dad kept bragging about how wonderful and oringinal they were. Taking his word I radomly bought Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Here is my review.<br />1.The &quot;title song&quot; was great and rocky opener. Yay!<BR>2.&quot;With a little help from my friends&quot; was a nice friendly layed back too with fun lyrics.

Yay!<BR>8.&quot;Within you without you.&quot; Same as track six. Boo!<BR>9.&quot;When I'm sixty-four&quot; A fun song about old folks. Yay!<BR>10.&quot;Lovely Rita&quot; A danceble ballad.

Yay!<BR>13.&quot;A day in the life.&quot; A unique way to end the album. Yay!<br />So if you're a new Beatles fan then get this for starters.
B00003CXXS|5.0|The original Jurassc Park is a classic and will never be surpassed. Lost world on the other hand was HORRIBLE and made me wish i wasn't a fan of the series. When I went to see Jurassic Park 3 i was kind of doubtful but when the movie was over I came out of the thearter very pleased. Jurssic Park 3 is a good action flick that anyone can enjoy!  It may be short but it will keep you entertained for the whole time that you are watching it. The cast in this movie is also really good. The cast includes Sam Neil from JP1, Tea Leoni(Deep Impact) William H Macy<BR>Alessandro Nivola(Best Laid Plans) and Trevor Morgan(The Glass House). Once again this is arealy FUN AND EXCITING  movie that everyone can enjoy and should buy on DVD now!
B000068PQ0|4.0|&quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; is a moody album, and another work of art from the Lips. This time around, they've traded in the symphonic beauty of &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; for a more electronica friendly sound. Some of my favorite cuts are the uplifting &quot;One More Robot/Symptahy 3000-21,&quot; and the sorrowful &quot;In the Morning of Magicians.&quot; Another fine release from the Flaming Lips.
B00005ASGG|5.0|It's hard to know where to begin with a movie as great as this.  After watching the first time, I remember experiencing a deep sadness, which of course, is what Ford intended.  I'm sure that some reviewers have panned the almost claustrophobic settings, but that is exactly what Ford intended -- there was no more room for a traditional western with expansive backdrops and the accompanying sense of boundlessness.  This film was, in my mind, the western that announced the end of westerns.  Just as John Wayne's character, however heroic and admirable, had no place in what would become civilized society, the western was also beginning to lose its appeal simply because it didn't make as much sense in a world that was changing.  I think a lot of John Wayne fans forget that Ford was trying to point out that Tom Doniphon was the person who most resembled Liberty Valance (not to mention the cattlmen) in that both were figures who relied on force, not law, not language.  And of course, Doniphon's shooting of Liberty was essentially murder, which is why Doniphon goes into a drunken rage.  Some viewers think that Doniphon behaves as he does because he realizes that he has lost Hallie.  Actually, he knows that because of what he has done, he cannot live with himself, much less the woman he loves.  This is only half the story, though.  Ford makes quite clear that the origins of society depend very much on men like Doniphon, and that in a different age, his way was absolutely essential.  If Doniphon's/Wayne's way of life had to go for the sake progress, then we cannot help but feel the loss of such nobility, however dangerous.  Honestly, I'm not a John Wayne fan, because sometimes the \\"rugged individualist\\" role became a stereotype that trapped him as a actor/character.  But in \\"Liberty,\\" Wayne exceeds all stereotypes and against the backdrop of his own obsolescence, emerges triumphantly human.
B00004WGAI|4.0|Both Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton portray their characters fully and completely as Jane and Rochester. I do agree with the other reviewers that after reading the novel, I imagined Jane as more of a vibrant character. However, I do enjoy Clarke's performance as Jane and contrary to other reviewers, I believed that she appeared to be in her late teens, 18 to 19. I don't see how anyone could see large hips umder the style of dress worn throughout the series. Yes, Jane Eyre is supposed to be a bit homely. It is hard to get past that though, we don't really accept plain on-screen, as a viewing public we flinch if somebody is \\"too plain.\\" I don't think Clarke was too plain, she was my image of Jane from reading the book. However, I agree with the reviewers who described her looking down too much. Dalton's performance really does overshadow Clarke's a bit, but she compliments his broodiness. The height difference didn't bother me.<br />I would give it 4 1/2 stars if shown in it's entirety. This two-tape set only has 239 minutes out of the 330 minutes when the miniseries first aired. Why was it cut down? It seems to me if they release this at 4 hours they could release it completely unedited as well.<br />This rendition is the most complete I have seen. Each version that I have seen has been enjoyable and brought out different facets of Bronte's characters and I have enjoyed them all for what they bring to this most wonderful novel. However, Dalton's performance is so staggeringly good here, the inclusion of several key scenes that are usually omitted such as the gypsy fortune teller make this version exceptional viewing...
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie was certainly INTERESTING. It firsts opens with an introduction of Amelie's life and how she views herself with in it.This girl goes through her life taking time to make everyone else happy ,doesn't take much time to make herself happy. Until she runs into this guy who collects peoples pictures.Then she decides to take charge of her life and plays a great game of cat and mouse. But you'll have to buy the movie to see how it ends.<BR>(The girl in the movie is the cutest girl ever)<BR>I totally loved this movie! It's a major chick flick...no matter what language you watch it in!
B00000I1OY|5.0|This is such a moving film. As I get older it takes on new meaning. We learn with age if we are smart enough to recognize it. That is what Burt Lancaster's character must come to grips with. Does he? This film is like a dream. What did you imagine and what was real? Again, that is what Burt Lancaster's character must come face to face with. Even some of the other characters must face the dream world they have created. I really love this movie. It is happy. It is sad. It makes you wonder how you have lived your life, or if you are still young, how you will live it.
B000001FN1|4.0|At first this album seemed kinda weak and timid, in comparison to the other groups I like (I.E. Megadeth, Disturbed, Metallica, Slayer, etc), and the truth be told, it is. However, after I had listened to this album a few times, i found myself discovering a depth and feeling that megadeth lacks. Its pretty cool, you should get it merely for the balance of really cool guitarwork, and competent vocals.
0375703764|4.0|I bought this book at an airport before getting on a flight.I practically had to be pried off the plane because I didn't want to be interrupted! This is probably one of the strangest and most disturbing books I have ever read. This book creates a real feeling of dread that will stay with you long after you have finished the book. The unusual writing style makes it a challenging read but it is well worth it.
0553528521|2.0|I was amazed to see so many complimentary reviews of this book, especially the ones that rate Bourdain as such a 'fine storyteller'. Maybe he comes across better in print; I listened to the Audible version that he narrates himself. The subject matter and his exploits are certainly entertaining. However, before I was halfway through the book I had developed such an intense dislike of the author that I could barely listen to the rest. I understand his intent to write a 'tell-all' description of life as a chef, and I have read many a book that used constant, never-ending, over-the-top foul language for that 'touch of realism'. But Bourdain just comes across as such an unpleasant S.O.B. on tape that I was soon sorry I had given money to his cause. In the end, it wasn't the behind-the-scenes stories of what really goes on in a kitchen that repulsed me so much as having spent six hours listening to someone who I would never want to sit through a dinner with. Get 'Fast Food Nation' instead.
B000065U1N|1.0|This was the worst film I have ever seen.  Not only did the absence of plot and character depth fail to involve me in the action, I became so bored that I actually started daydreaming about other things to entertain myself while I was sitting in the theater.  I almost fell asleep becasue the sound of bullets was so rhythmic as to become soothing.  The film shows no concern for non-Americans, and the whole thing plays like a shooting gallery game at the state fair: set 'em up and knock 'em down.  It was the most shallow, degrading thing I have ever put myself through, and I caution anyone but the most carnage-loving fan to stay as far away from this film as possible.
B000067CPX|3.0|I started listening to this album hoping that they would continue with the greatness they created on \\"Californiacation.\\"  What I found instead was that half of the album was just that, and the other half was good but not as great.  The first half of the album didn't hold my attention as much as I hoped it would.  But beginning with \\"Midnight\\" the album makes a remarkable turn around and managed to blow me away.  Is there any greater song on here than \\"Cabron?\\"  That song was amazing, with the flamingo stlye mixed in with the Chili Pepper stlye, astonishing.  But like I said before, this album is half and half.
B00000IQW3|5.0|One of the movies I was the most excited to be remastered to DVD. This is an excellent disc and contains great making-of footage. This was way ahead of its time for a movie using computer graphics. The story is great and can be enjoyed by the whole family. There's a scene where the younger brother is flipping through his Playboy collection. I can remember my mom editing that out of the VHS copy we taped off of TV so long ago. That's the only part of the movie that younger kids shouldn't see. The movie also stars the late and great Robert Preston as the Starfighter recruiter in his last role. If I had to pick the best DVDs from my collection, this would be one of them.
0783211856|5.0|I don't even know what to say to begin this review, except this. This film is one of the best and most moving historical pieces that I have ever seen. Based on the novel by Thomas Kineally (I hope I spelled that right) this film is a powerful testament to the fact that one man can make an incredible difference in the lives of many people. In this case the man in question is Oskar Schindler, a Nazi Party member and war profiteer.<BR>     I cannot find enough praise to ladle onto this film. The screenplay by Steven Zallian is absolutely first-rate stuff. But you need GOOD actors to pull off any script and make it work.<br />Enter Liam Neeson. I had not heard of him until I had seen DARKMAN (1990) and thought that in that case he saved a film with his compelling performance. He absolutely BLEW me AWAY here. Oskar's change from a businessman who cared for nothing except money, profit, and his own public image to a compassionate humanitarian willing to throw away his last cent to save over 1,100 people's lives is heartwrenching, beautiful and inspiring. Liam pulls the role off with incredible skill and passion. Standing beside him as the PERFECT counterbalance is Ralph Fiennes as the German commandante Amon Goethe. This man is cold enough to make Jack the Ripper look like Charlie Brown. His eyes speak volumes of icy hatred without a word being spoken. And that voice...the quiet chill in it... is like molten magma boiling under the surface, just before it erupts with deadly fury. Goethe is a man that seems to give new meaning to the phrase \\"less than human\\". He is utterly frigid, merciless, and utterly compelling as the man you cannot help but cringe at in fear and hatred. My hat is off to Ralph Fiennes for doing such a wonderful job as one the screens most memorable and chilling villians. Ben Kingsley is also wonderful as Itzhak Stern, an ordinary man who ends up working for Schindler as his accountant and plays a pivotal role in the saving of the 1,100+ Jews on what becomes known as \\"Schindler's List\\". All of the actors and actresses involved in this film gave 100% believable and compelling performances here. There were quite a few moments in this film as I watched it for the the first time that there was not a dry eye anywhere in the theater.<br />Kudos must also go to Steven Spielberg for his masterful and compassionate directing of this picture. I am THANKFUL this thing was shot in black-and-white. To see all that violence and attrocity in full color would have been overkill. The picture is violent and horrifying enough as it is. Plus the black and white filming gives the picture the feeling of a documentary, and I think that is exactly what Steven Spielberg wanted to do here. He did not want to \\"create\\" and tell a \\"story\\" He wanted to show people the horror of one of the blackest periods of time in human history. He wanted to be sure we were so transfixed by this that the lessons it tells will remain etched in our hearts forever. And he pulls it off quite wonderfully with room to spare.<br />     One final note of congratulations must be given here. I give that note with pride to Mr. John Williams, the composer of music that for years has touched the hearts of many generations of people. Rather than go with grand and scary cinematic music as he has in the past done, what John Williams did here is to make a score that is simple, very gentle, very elegant and absoulutely heartbreaking to hear. His use of the violin (masterfully played by Itzhak Perlman, KUDOS!) along with piano, flute, gentle strings and tragic but inspiring choir pieces and songs stands as perhaps the most heart-touching score in movie history. It perfectly captures the terrifying plight of a people facing extinction and the desperation and despair in their daily lives as they struggle to survive one of the darkest times in history that this planet and the human race has ever known.<br />     In short, this is a BEAUTIFUL, tragic, and ultimately grand picture that NEEDS to be seen. It WILL grab hold of your heart and MAKE you feel. It will make you think. It will make you shake your head and weep that humans be so cruel to one another. You will at the end weep again, in joy that one man had the courage to stand up and defy tyranny to save the lives of 1,100 people. If only we all had that kind of heart and that kind of courage. <BR>     <BR>     This is NOT a movie for young kids. As I have said before it is  very violent and tragic. It is however in the end beautiful and inspiring and heartwarming in a very real way. It is undoubtedly.... as the headline for my review says, one of the most POWERFUL movies of all time. Sit back and give it a look. The way you look at movies and life itself may never be the same again after you see this picture.
B00005JKNC|3.0|In my late teens I was a huge Jim Carrey fan.  As soon as Ace Ventura came out, I was hooked.  After seeing him act in several movies, you can see beyond the comedy of the screenplay and look at the performances being given.  He proved with Liar Liar, The Truman Show, and Man on the Moon that he could act beyond comedy.  Unfortunately I believe that he waited too long in his career to take on a non comedic role such as this one.  I personally liked the movie and the performance by Carrey.  But most of his fans are too far gone to see him as much more than a clown.  Although I did like the acting in this film, I wasn't that impressed with the screenplay.  It was not very believable that a person could be mistaken to the degree that his character was.  With that aside, it was a decent movie.  If for no other reason than to see a good performance from Jim Carrey, I recommend seeing The Majestic.
B000068QY7|2.0|Oasis is no longer the band they once were.  They fail to write any songs that linger in our heads for more than a day, and even the songs that do stay in our heads for more than a day are there because we are clinging to some hope that Oasis will someday return.  That return appears to be fading.  Everytime they release an album, I give them another chance... I think this was there last chance.  They just don't have it anymore.  Even the best song on here, &quot;songbird,&quot; was forced and beyond simple.  I'm sorry to see Oasis go.
6304698526|4.0|This is a classic movie with Steve McQueen which many people will find boring, but if you're a fan of any Clint Eastwood style film you'll enjoy this. It's kind of a slow pace, but the film is highly detailed to represent things as they are in the real world. It also features one of the greatest, and probably the first great car chase scenes in movie history through the streets and hills of San Francisco. Steve McQueen actually does a lot of his own stunt driving in the movie. Excellent mastered picture quality.
0312265859|5.0|I love Janet Evanovich!  Yes the characters in Stephanie Plums life are getting a little too familiar, yep, I can't believe she is still so inept, yep to all those negatives.  BUT if you want a book you can enjoy from cover to cover while sitting on the beach, go for Hard Eight.  Assuming you have read the other 7!  I laughed out loud more than once, my friends around me urging me on to finish so they could read it! Very entertaining, a good read.
B00003CY0V|4.0|Prior to viewing this film, I had read all the poor reviews from critics regarding it, but I still wanted to see it anyway.  Perhaps this was because I knew that critics rarely gave action films good reviews at all, or perhaps it is because I knew I just happened to like this sort of film, but I watched it anyway.  <br />It's actually a pretty good film.  Sure, I can see how some critics could say that on the surface it has no plot and is poorly acted.  However, if you take the time to look deeper, you discover that this is really not the case.  Travolta's character in particular carries with him a lot of depth---he is always five steps ahead of everyone else, and the director does a great job carrying this throughout the movie.  In addition, Hugh Jackman does an excellent job playing the role of Stanley, the hacker Travolta's character needs.  And, of course, Halle Berry delivers a great performance also.  All in all, I think it was acted very well, and I watched the movie twice just to catch everything.  <br />In some respects, it's your typical action movie, but in others, it's a completely different flavor.  You be the judge if you like it or not---but it is certainly worth viewing to find out.  <br />As an endnote, I think the film holds some great implications for the post-9/11 world....if nothing else, it will make you think about the ideas it raises in regards to controlling terrorism.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I'm tired of people calling &quot;the Strokes&quot; left overs from the 80's.  Seriously people, not much this good ever came from the 80's.  Is This It, is easily one of the best of 2001, and it's popularity is making it one of the best of 2002 also.  The songs on this album on instantly catchy without being annoying.  Fab Morreti is a great drummer that accents the stinging guitars of the group.  &quot;Last Nite&quot; is a great song, and well... all the songs are great.  Just an all around terrific album.
B00000K19E|5.0|What can you write about the Matrix that hasn't been written? Hands down one of the most innovate and original movies to come along in a long time. The reason this movie has taken DVD by storm is because other movies just aren't original any more. On top of that, this movie is perhaps the most essential DVD for demoing a home theater. The computer-aided action and filming is incredible. While the movie is rated R (which kept me from seeing it for so long) I couldn't find anything in it to justify that. There are some tough fight scenes (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had fight scenes too) but the language and fighting combined justify a PG-13 at the most.  I would assume they got it rated R so that more people would be interested in seeing it.

B00005JL3A|5.0|These days, when we hear about video games being adapted to the big screen, all fans of said video game begin to weep and complain.  And I can't blame them.  Just look at the other Video Game-Movies out there:  \\"Street Fighter\\", \\"Super Mario Bros.\\", \\"Mortal Kombat\\"(1&2), and \\"Tomb Raider\\".  None are very good at all.  As a matter of fact, they all [stink].  So when I heard news of \\"Resident Evil\\" taking the doomed trip, I was kind of [ticked] off in a sense.  Then, I heard Milla Jovovich, and Michelle Rodriguez, two very gorgeous women, were starring in it.  This got me a little excited, but then I asked myself:  \\"Remember how hot Angelina Jolie is, and look at 'Tomb Raider'\\".  So it rolled around in theaters, and I went to it as an alternative to \\"Blade II\\", which was beyond sold out.<br />I was blown away, to say the least.  I loved how Paul Anderson didn't use a whole lot CGI, and how he gave a fairly thorough explanation of what made the zombies, well, zombies.  Not many other zombie movies give explanations.  Just take the Romero flicks as an example.  But altogether, this isn't exactly a zombie-fest.  It balances the horror with wit, like the video game did before it.  It also transfers a lot of the video game into the movie, such as the mansion, certain names(Nemesis), a few tricky angles, and creatures(the dogs and Lickers).  This altogether makes a pretty darn cool movie.  I also really enjoyed how he brought the zombies to the screen.  He gave them poor skin, and made them barely decomposed.  I prefer that over entirely decomposed bodies.  It scares the viewer a bit more, because we can still see the human side of the zombie poking through.  The best zombies on-screen to date.  Not a great film by any means, but definitely one of the coolest movies I've ever seen.  Not to mention the first time I saw it, I jumped a good 5 times.  Upon second viewing, I still jumped twice.<br />Onto the features.  The Slipknot video is just that, nothing great unless you'rea huge fan of the band.  The featurettes are cool.  The making of is the best by far, and the \\"Scoring Resident Evil\\" was extremely interesting, considering the score in the movie was great.  Other than that, the make-up tests, and costume trials weren't spectacular, rather short, but still fun.  The highight on this disc in the Commentary track.  On the track is the director, Paul Anderson, Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, and the producer(the name escapes my mind right now).  They're all very comfortable with eachother, and crack wise quite often.  They talk about an upcoming sequel, which excites me, but I'm curious as to how they'd bring back Rain(hopefully they will!).  The only thing is that it was recorded before the film was released theatrically, so I wonder if the box office gross will affect the sequel?<br />Overall, the disc is about a 4.5, and the movie, a 5.  It's not the best acting around, it's not gonna give anybody nightmares, but it's guaranteed to make you jump.  And if you enjoyed the video game, you'll love the movie.  Take it from a fan of the game.  So, go out and rent it or buy it.  Just make sure you see it, and enjoy all the horrifying goodness!
B00005B36H|5.0|I have waited well over a year to post this review, but I now feel it is time.  I wanted to wait, to get to know every single nuance of the album, discover the meaning and then force my self to reconsider my own perceptions.  I have waited until the final pieces of understanding fell into place, and I now feel that I am ready.<br />Lateralus has been in my possession since its release and I am glad that I waited to post a review, because it took me over three months just to listen to the album all the way through.<br />I cannot argue with those that call this album inaccessible.  After the first 20 times I tried to listen to it and ended up turning it off halfway through, I was heartbroken.  Tool has been my favorite band and a defining factor in my life ever since I first heard them in 94 or so.  Aenima was always in my car, my home stereo, my garage stereo and ripped to the pc so that no matter where I was I could listen to it.  Undertow was the same before that and Opiate was always along for a change of pace.  But Lateralus just couldn't catch me and day after day I hated it more and more.<br />So I took a month off from Tool.  I avoided everything associated with Tool.  No toolshed.down.net; if Schism came on, the radio went off; shirts were hidden away; CDs went into their cases and on the rack.  And then I returned, popped in Lateralus in hopes that I would find what must certainly be there, but I had continually missed.  You can fill in the rest of the story from this: Lateralus is the greatest work in the history of music.<br />Never have I heard a record so artfully conceived, so subtle in its true meaning, so beautiful.  From the powerful opener, to the incredibly complex closer (ignoring faaip), not a single second of this album was left unrefined.  It feels as though the band must have gone over every song thousands of times in an effort to create a cohesive work of art that can not be paralleled.<br />Lateralus is the first of Tool's albums to truly convey their message of \\"Think for yourself; question authority.\\"  Unlike their previous three albums which were all fashioned to blatantly state this message, Lateralus carries the message on its own right.  The music asks the listener to create their own message, to explore themselves through the broad template Tool has provided.  You must look at yourself and at the community you exist in.  It tires to provide direction, and to foster understanding, self-reflection and communication.<br />This is just the beginning of the message I have found in Lateralus.  It is no longer merely a great album.  It is a work of art and philosophy.  It is a guide post, but where it points is different for every listener.  I challenge you to look at it as more than music.  Find what the album means to you and not merely how good it sounds to you.  And always realize that the album is at its finest when experienced communally.  If you can possibly get to a Tool concert, go.  If not, find a group to listen, enjoy and later discuss it with.  <br />Think for yourself; Question Authority.  (My viewpoint is not exempt, if YOU think I am a moron, than YOU are right.)
B00003CXDG|1.0|Here's the biggest disappointment of the 2000 movie season. I really enjoyed Mission Impossible 1 and was looking forward to another plot twisting and action packed movie. Instead I saw an semi-action packed non-twisting movie that just didn't seem to live up to any of the hype surrounding its release. Would someone please slap John Woo and tell him to knock it off with the slow motion scenes? If it wasn't for the first mission impossible success I don't think half the people who went and saw the sequel would have gone. I still don't know why I bought this movie. It was part of a large order that I had a $20 coupon for. It's an entertaining movie (until it gets just too unrealistic) for a large group of people, but you can't sit and watch it by yourself.
B00005QIPH|2.0|OK, you can say whatever you like about these guys -- good, bad, boring, exciting, original, rip-offs (personally I find it to be incredible shallow sounding and boring), but they are SO far from being \\"saviors of rock n' roll\\" it's not even funny. FACT: This CD DOES NOT ROCK. Just a warning before you buy. It is very limp rock, and this is inarguable. Whether you like that style or not is another story, and you have a right to your opinion... Hype or no hype, this simply ain't rocking music, folks.
B000067CPX|5.0|As a teenagers in the early 1990s, we knew one thing.  We liked our music disaffected and we liked it hard.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers gave us all we could handle with their album Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  Now ten years later, they come back with By The Way, one of their most complete efforts as a band.<br />John Frusciante's guitar dominates this album, supplements the rest of the band and makes Anthony Kiedis's voice that much stronger.  Kiedis's voice has taken a hit over the years, but it comes across with just the right tone for this album.<br />This is an unbelieveable effort from front to end.  Notable tracks include, the title track, \\"Universally Speaking,\\" and \\"Tear.\\"  My favorite track is \\"The Zephyr Song\\" for reasons stated above.  Solid guitar, an all-band performance and fluid vocals.<br />I highly recommend this album.
0316666343|3.0|This book is beautifully written, but it took me weeks to get through it--it's a very slow read.  Good, not great.  I'd recommend &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; or &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;.
B00004U8JV|4.0|Fortunately I hadn't seen this film in a long time when I popped in the DVD. I thought that the sound and the picture quality of the disc were outstanding. From a technical point of view I have to say that the effects were much more impressive than those of Jurassic Park. The downside was the plot. I read the book before watching this movie the first time and there was material in the book that would have made for a much more exciting movie, but instead they took the fun-approach and just cranked out an entertaining movie, period. So as far as a descent brain wasting movie, The Lost World is quite entertaining.
0792101448|5.0|This movie is a classic. Watching it more than once just makes it better. I'm getting old waiting for the DVD to be released. If it is not released soon, I will record it myself on a DVD, recorded direct from a Direct TV showing on the western chan.<br />Id rather pay, however, the studio cannot deny us loyal viewers any longer. <br />Anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing a movie masterpiece.
0790742780|4.0|a good movie in my opinion.  This is a movie like many movies I like in that I know many other people will not.  What I like about this movie is 'simply' how Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall characters seem to be completly unrelated.  Yet in so many aspects of the movie the character's lives are paralled.  Yet despite the fact that both started the journey from the same place, and faced simliar obstructions along the way.  In the end when their paths crossed only one man's journey could continue. The question is why only one?  When did the other become the bad guy and when did he reach the point of no return?  <BR>G00dFlick ;-)
0609610570|1.0|I read 4-5 books on management a month and this was by far the worst I've read in years. It's just flat out boring and goes on...and on....and on about stories which have little bearing on the points then made in reference.<br />Larry feels he must tell us, this $20 billion company... this $50 billion company, this $25 billion company. Who cares what the market cap of the company is... management should not be any stronger (or weaker) based on the market cap of a company.<br />Read every word up to page 94 and then had to start scanning for interesting parts because I couldn't take it any more.<br />Not worth the time or money.<br />Sorry Larry...
0767817478|2.0|I think most everyone saw this movie and most wish they hadn't. The movie is essentially a great exercise in special effects. I have to admit that I enjoy the characters of Matthew Broderick and especially Jean Reno, but the rest of them are just too cheesy. I don't know who let the lines in the script get through, but there should have been a much better plot for the film. I bought it to crank on my sound system, but now that Jurassic Park is out I can only see Jean Reno fans buying it.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this cd,its not often u can buy or listen to a whole cd and like the whole thing.I usually buy a cd and like maybe one or two songs on the whole cd but this cd every single song is good,its great just to pop in and listen to the whole thing.My favorite song on this cd would have to be 'Crawling'great song.I recommend you buy this cd if you want something that u can listen to without having to change cds every 5 mins.GREAT CD!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|A great, dark, surreal experience.  I knew I had to see this movie when I read about the scary man in the bunny suit bringing warnings about the end of the world, and it didn't disappoint.  As moody as the Crow, as cryptic as Mulholland Drive, and still funny.  Plus a great soundtrack throughout with Joy Division and a heartbreaking remake of Tears For Fears \\"Mad World\\".  If nothing else, it's highly original, and worth several hours of discussion and a second watch.  I loved it!
1577311523|4.0|For those who are familiar with Eastern Wisdom, as embodied in the Advaita Vedanta, for example, there is little here that is new.  In fact Siddhartha of Guatama, the Buddha, a Hindu, expounded on these same ideas 600 years before Christ, and the Hindu Vedas are full of the same theme.  Buddhism, of course, also explores the area.<br /><br />That does not make this book any less valuable.  For one thing, it is written by a Westerner who does not use Eastern jargon and nomenclature. And Tolle has a handle on his subject matter.<br /><br />Tolle's main thrust is that, in order to achieve inner peace, one should try to stay in the Now, since the past no longer exists and the future has not yet arrived.  In point of fact, everything that happens, or ever has happened, takes place in the Now.  Now is where we reflect on the past, where remorse for past actions takes place, and where our fears and hopes for the future reside.  But the only action we can ever take is right here, in the Now.<br /><br />The other main point that the author makes is the necessity to quiet our chattering mind, and not to identify our thoughts as our Self.  The real Self is the observer, who stand outside the mind and uses thought (the brain) as a tool.<br /><br />I wrote a book addressing most of the same points, with very similar conclusions, after experiencing some of the same things as Eckhart Tolle. Tolle, it seems to me, makes his point better than I did.<br /><br />There is much to be learned from this book.  Those who have read deeply into the Eastern philosophies will find nothing new, perhaps, but they will also find little to dispute.<br /><br />Joseph Pierre<br /><br />author of The Road to Damascus and other books
0783244320|5.0|Galaxy Quest is an interesting movie. It's one of those silly funny movies. People whose movies have to be serious shouldn't watch this film. The DVD has some behind the scenes stuff, but I don't think that the film is interesting enough to watch a making-of for. Just a fun Tim Allen Movie.
B000002R9X|5.0|I listened to this album throughout an entire summer one year during a significant breakup.  Interestingly, the entire time I hadn't made the connection.  It could just be my interpretation, but from start to finish this album seems like a clear, objective view of the end of a relationship, accurately describing the varying reactions and eventual acceptance.  This and The Power and the Glory are easily two of my favorite albums.
B000001ESP|4.0|I remember being 9 and first hearing Tom Sawyer. Now,20+ yrs later it still is used in Rushs setlist. Though now kind of tired of hearing it,the rest of the album still rocks. Pick it up Camera Eye is the best tune on the album. Red Barchetta definately puts you in the drivers seat, Wich Hunt lets you know racism [stinks], YYZ puts you in Canada's airport, limelight lets you know being rich and famous is a pain somtimes, vital signs lets you know this album is vital. Get it or face the priests of Syrinx!!! BTW, see Rush this tour. They kick [rear].
0920668372|5.0|Love You Forever<br />          Love You Forever written by Robert Munsch and published by Firefly Books Ltd. This was a very cute book I thought. What I liked most about this book is that no matter what the boy does or how he acts the mother will still always love him forever. This book is a book that shows how much love a mother has for her child. I would highly recommend this book!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Simply Incredible. I didn't know what to expect when I saw this in the theater, but I ended up paying closer attention to this movie than to any other I'd seen which exceeded 2 hours. This movie, although extremely violent, has an awesome story that is very inspiring. It's about someone who does things for the right reason. It's interesting how throughout the whole movie our Gladiator is really a person who would rather not kill, but does so because he has to. I lived in Italy for two years and never visualized Rome as it truly was before this movie. Although it's rated R for extreme violence and some incestuous overtures, the story is too good to not see.
B000053GTK|4.0|I'm pretty sure I bought the import cd, and it sounds very tinny.  So much so that the glass shattering break into the first song is migraine inducing.  As for the album itself, I place it somewhere behind free hand and the power and the glory.  The concept is great, but it is a bit uneven.
0451163516|5.0|Follett does a great job of developing and describing the four main characters in the novel.  He also does an excellent job of describing the setting and time in which the novel takes place (pre WWI).  Once you begin this book you should set aside some time because you find yourself reading all day.  This definitely ranks in my top ten.
0920668372|2.0|I did not like this book because it was very unrealistic.It also  had too many words and we all know that a toddler would not sit through a very long book. Plus is a very emotional subject to read to a kid under the age of seven years old.I would only recommend this book for ages seven and older or if you're going to talk to a child about a relative who is dying or very sick. Personally, I would not buy this book for my three year old but is only my opinion.
630529142X|4.0|Fun movie, although as with all Sandler movies it's a little much for kids. If the guy could clean up his language and get rid of the sexual referrences then I'd recommend it for all families cause there's such a fun story here, but as it is I can't. Well, actually, given the parents take 10 year olds to see the latest slasher movies, they probably don't mind them watching this too. Entertaining movie that has a great soundtrack and some fun action.
B00005JKJA|5.0|For all you morons out there who did not give this film 5 stars, its because you don't understand it. This film is a masterpeice, clearly.  It may take 2-3 veiwing to understand, but thats the beauty of it, this is what David Lynch wants, us to think! Not every movie can do that!  This film is pure art, and if you are intelligent enough to like thinking, you will enjoy this tale of .........
B00005O5CM|3.0|Very clever movie that Reese Witherspoon does a great job in.  Not recommended for younger kids due to some crude jokes, but definitely a fun movie for college-age and up who have been there.
B000000W6R|5.0|This CD has some very good songs on it, mostly &quot;landslide&quot;, &quot;soothe&quot; and &quot;frail and bedazzled&quot; pop out at you. I have to say that the cover of Landslide is billions of times better than the Fleetwood Mac version, Billy plays it with a lot more emotion.
B00004U8JU|5.0|A great demo DVD for when your friends come over. This movie has a great plot and great action. I can remember seeing this movie in the theater. I had already read the book, but I was still squirming and jumping in my seat. I got the DTS version since my receiver handles DTS. The disc does come with a Dolby Stereo mix so that you can listen through your TV if you need to. The sound is just crystal clear and you get the feeling that the wind is really blowing through your room, or that it's raining.
0784011710|5.0|I'm not sure whether I would call this a great film, for it fails to convey the nuances and complexities of characterization of the novel, and also, its elements of wry humor, but Meryl Streep as Sophie is simply overwhelmingly heart-rending in her portrayal of a person whose soul is destroyed as a consequence of having to live with the memory of how she was forced to cope with the Nazi genocide. I can't watch it without being profoundly shaken. Kevin Kline and Peter McNichols are excellent as well, but it is Streep as the doomed Sophie who is the heart and soul of this movie.
B00004TFK2|5.0|This is one of those Will Smith fun movies. You watch this movie for the special effects and sounds. So in that sense it's worth having in your collection to bring life to your home theater every so often. Kids enjoy this film, so it's a great family movie.
B000021XS0|5.0|&quot;Are you justified&quot; in joining 6 of the best musicians of the world in one single group, God?  Thank god they have side projects!  A big bravo for this music.  it's beyond enjoyable.<br />Quotations taken from their new CD, &quot;Six Degrees of inner turbulence&quot;
B00005JKQZ|3.0|Arrgh, movies like A Beautiful Mind get me riled up.  They're films that involve a respectable cast and crew with an inspirational story that's meant to shout to the Academy, \\"Hand me the Oscar!\\", and of course, the Academy Awards fell for it.<br />I'm not going to use the \\"historical inaccuracy\\" complaints that so many have used to cite as the film's biggest problem.  Inaccuracies don't bug me (unless a film makes a point of proclaiming that it's historically accurate) since I would only be a fool to actually expect perfect adherence to fact in a movie.  <br />No, what hurts A Beautiful Mind is its occasional cornball script and heavy-handed direction from Ron Howard.  Everything is played out in a typical, predictable fashion, with the love story offering little in the way of genuine surprise or even emotion (though Crowe and Connelly do put in great effort).  Even the schizophrenia that Nash is afflicted by feels Hollywood.  Rather than giving us truly off-the-wall delusions, we get a (spoiler) roommate who gives \\"good\\" advice and a silly conspiracy theory.  Plus, these delusions feel rather polished, as if though telling us that schizophrenia can be dealt with if you just ignore them. <br />By far the film's most embarrassing moment is the big speech in the finale, thudding us over the head with the film's grand message on how emotion and heart are far more important than intellect.  Oh, it's a nice message and a vital truth, but I would have liked it delivered in a more subtle manner.  <br />Overall, decent movie, though hardly the best film of 2001.  That honor belongs to Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down.
038532653X|5.0|Michael has just moved into a run down new house that needs a great deal of repair. His mother just gave birth to a new baby sister - but the baby needs to stay in the hospital because it is very ill. When the baby finally does come home, the doctor who tends to the baby does not seem very positive. Aching from the turmoil in his new life, Michael quests into the garage, where he finds a creature. Is it real? Or is it his imagination? When the garage begins to crumble, Michael calls on the aide of his unique neighbor and friend Mina to save the creature. Written in a beautifully graceful and poetic style, touching on deep spirituality without ever becoming convoluted and lost, Skellig should be read by everyone. It will change you.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It doesn't matter who the Strokes are.  Rich kids?  Just about every star winds up rich, and I don't think this discredits their music any more than the personal wealth of the Strokes' members does.  The fact is that the Strokes' album IS one of the best rock albums released last year, and is hands-down the best MAINSTREAM rock album put out in a long time.  The reason the Strokes will save rock is because their label will push them out from the deep crevices where other so-called &quot;genuine&quot; rock acts crawl to tan or burn under your capricious gaze (and honestly, some of these guys could use a tan).  So to all those wearing rock t-shirts from unknown bands to &quot;prove you were there and heard of them first&quot;, just admit that the music on Is This It is fantastic and you just don't like anything that plays on non-college radio.  If you want a great album, click and buy the Strokes.  If you want to pose about musical knowledge, go buy some vinyl and just shut up.
B00000IQC8|5.0|Ever had a meaningless boring job?  Then you'll laugh so hard you may wet your pants!
038532653X|5.0|What a wondrous story! I'm smiling just thinking about it. A thin layer removed from superficial reality, SKELLIG's enchantment and wisdom will charm you.<br />Shhh.... If you listen carefully.....you can almost hear the beating of wings.
B000068PQ0|3.0|I like the Flaming Lips so I was excited to get this new album. The music is very nice as I expected, but there are many words in the songs about this &quot;character&quot; yoshimi &quot;taking lots of vitamins&quot; to fight robots and such for example that I find very annoying. I heard this is supposed to be a concept album, but a better lyrical execution of the concept would have improved matters greatly. I still think it's worth getting for the music alone however.
B000002ADT|4.0|Previous reviewers of this work have expressed their horror that anyone would think of giving this jazz classic less than 5 stars. After all, &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is a collaboration of some of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, a meeting of legends. Even the least informed listener would be familiar with the stature of John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderly, Bill Evans, and the master himself, Miles Davis. And indeed, this is a masterpiece, but it takes some diligent listening to really get the point of this recording. It's easy to relegate this to background music, and when you think of jazz after midnight, this is exactly what you think of. As soon as the opening number, &quot;So What&quot;, began, it had a certain familiarity, as if I'd heard this somewhere before, and maybe I have. It's great, of course, as is &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot;, probably my favorite track on the CD. Unlike many purists, I appreciate the alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;, actually preferring that to the original.<br />So why don't I give this five stars? Because I admire this CD very, very much, but I don't LOVE it. That's not a fault of the CD at all, in fact, it's like the old line &quot;It's not you, it's me.&quot; I'm a rock 'n roll/pop music guy to the bone, and I just dabble occasionally in jazz. My only other Miles Davis recording is &quot;Live/Evil&quot; which came out eleven years later, and is so different from this that it's like a different Miles Davis recorded it. As heretical as it seems, &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; off &quot;Live/Evil&quot; is five times more interesting to me than anything off &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. I know giving this album five stars would garner more helpful votes than my four star review, but I have to be honest. This is a great CD that everyone should have, but not one that I'll keep going back to as often as I will others.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|To start my review off: I have never seen nor read any previous works related to this movie, and therefore, unlike many reviewers, I review based on this movie alone, not its comparison to others or some book.<br />This movie is great, from the very beginning to the very end.  It takes you everywhere from days long ago to a high-tech future, and back? again to a primative world.  While there may be a few points at which the plot falls off a little bit, it is not much, and overall its still amazing.  The graphics and rendering done for this movie are superb.<br />The last thing I'll mention is the score for this movie.  The score, composed and conducted by Klaus Badelt, is amazing from start to finish.  The few and sparse choral segments are just enough to leave you awe stricken and ready for more.
B00000G3PL|5.0|If you're planning to purchase this DVD set no doubt you are already a big fan of the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" series or are buying it for someone who already is, so you don't need a long dissertation about each of the movies.  It's just great having the entire series in the DVD format.  You can't go wrong in adding this set to your collection!  Go for it and have yourself a \\"Lethal Weapon\\" marathon!
0792839730|3.0|A Bridge Too Far was trashed when it opened in 1977 for reasons of length and appearing old-fashioned in a world that was about to be changed by Star Wars.<br />Looking at this film now, you can see that ABTF isn't a bad film per se, but one that ought never to have been made. Why endure a three hour pummelling for a rout? If you watch this film and know little history, it looks as though the Allies lost WWII.<br />Compared with a modern war film, say Blackhawk Down, which also concerns a battlefield disaster, you can see that ABTF is prissy almost, in its depiction of combat, and so obsessed with \\"STAR\\" quality that its distracting.  The producer needed Olivier, Redford, and the superfluous Liv Ullman to open this film, otherwise who would come to see it?  Still, no one did.<br />Really, this film has its values in 1950's film production. Richard Attenborough directs with competence, but without verve. Ridley Scott's BD is compelling, involving, and disturbing, much more so given the scope of the action and its consquences (small and not many).<br />Worth seeing if you're a history freak.  Worth seeing if you like Anthony Hopkins playing somebody who would refrain from eating the brains out of a living skull.  Worth seeing if you like Hardy Kruger in an SS uniform. Worth seeing if you understand that Monty was a poor general and his precense in Allied command arguably delayed the defeat of Germany by six months.<br />Side note: for an accurate account of the 101's involvement, see the Eindhoven segment of \\"Band of Brothers.\\"<br />Like most wars, A Bridge Too Far is a noble waste. What were they thinking?
B000067CPX|5.0|For all of you that say this CD is subpar because its too mellow and you can't mosh to it, need to get a life.  This CD is beautiful and shows how diverse and talented this band really is.  I can imagine it gets really boring being in a band and writing the same music all the time.  Give them a break and listen to this CD with an open mind.  It is the most melodic and crafty album they have put out yet.  That is where the true talent lies, not on whether or not you can mosh to it
B00006690F|5.0|Another great CD by Eminem! I particularly like the fact that he actually sings on this CD! In Halie's song he sings a very emotional song to his daughter. While unlike Marshall Mather's LP, not EVERY song on this CD is great, but most of them are. The best part is that we see the more serious side of Eminem. He discusses serious issues in a serious fashion. More songs on this CD resemble his all time best song, The Way I Am. Great CD -worth every cent.
0761119752|5.0|Pajama Time! is a wonderful story that my daughter looks forward to.  The rhyme and rhythm of this story makes her giggle and bounce around.  She loves the \\"Pajammy to the left, Pajammy to the right\\" part, and we move around to the beat as I read.  This story will be a part of her bedtime routine for a long time.  She started to enjoy the book at about 6 months and now she helps turn the pages as I read!  When she is older, she will get more from the book, such as the different types of \\"jammy\\" characteristics!  I would highly recommend this book.  It is very easy to read these stories in an animated way to entertain your child!

0316666343|5.0|This book was one of the most moving stories I have ever read and have recommended it to all of my friends. What a powerful, sad, inspiring story. This book will stay with me a very long time. I cannot wait to see what she writes next.
B00005JKJA|1.0|...P>My problem with this movie is that the purpose of this medium is to relay a<br />message.  Whether the Writer/Director intends this message to be purely<br />entertainment based (Bruckheimer), or expects the viewers to work a little<br />harder (i.e. Memento).  Lynch seems to have decided that his cult following<br />is enough and there is no need to tell anyone what this message is.  The<br />fact that he tries to bail himself out by tossing in some eye-candy and a<br />girl on girl sex scene is apalling.  We the viewers are expected to be<br />mesmorized into watching this movie because it has pretty people in it, all<br />the while praying that the answer to the puzzle that Lynch lays out in the<br />first half of the movie will be answered in an acceptable manner.<br />This movie provides a ringing endorsement, as well as a reminder, to avoid<br />future Lynch projects.
B0000640VO|4.0|&quot;Amelie&quot; is one of the few foreign-language films to use the DVD format to its potential. The director, enthusiastic DVD collector Jean-Pierre Jeunet, says he was inspired by M. Night Shyamalan's work on the first &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; DVD and by Sylvester Stallone's &quot;Rocky&quot; commentary. Jeunet, who recently polished up his English, can be hard to understand at first, but soon proves a captivating storyteller.<br />Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's bold images are captured in widescreen (2.35:1), with enhancements for 16:9 monitors. The odd but captivating green color scheme, saturated to verdant plushness in digital post-production, looks great. The cirque reds, blues and yellows retain their vibrant pop. The Dolby Digital (5.1) audio, however, fails to keep up with the playfulness of the Oscar-nominated sound editing (no DTS, alas). Still, the sound is strong and clear. Rear speakers are used sparingly, leaving the heavy lifting to the front three. Center channel voices are clear and resonant without boominess; the subwoofer stays busy keeping up with the boomerang dynamics.<br />A 13-minute featurette on &quot;The Look of 'Amelie' &quot; shows Jeunet working his visual magic. Jeunet replaced the sky in many of his outdoor shots, preferring to create his own weather digitally. The seemingly naturalist film is in fact crammed with special effects, he points out. A scene in which Amelie skips rocks across water was done digitally because the actress couldn't get the hang of throwing stones. The &quot;explosion of color&quot; in the film came as digital timing was manipulated to saturate the images. &quot;We could change everything (digitally),&quot; Jeunet says. &quot;It was a miracle.&quot;<br />Although the movie was written for Emily Lloyd, we know Amelie as French actress Audrey Tautou, the highly photogenic but rubber-faced comedienne who charmed audiences worldwide. Disc 2 includes her screen test, which made the director's casting decision an easy one. (There are a few clips of the actress having her long hair cut into the famed Amelie bob and some funny blooper clips.)<br /> True to the spirit of &quot;Amelie,&quot; the typical making-of featurette is replaced by &quot;home movies&quot; that have fun with elements from the film such as the photo-booth snapshots and the hilarious orgasm blitz. The screen-test section includes a must-see performance by Yolande Mureau, who powered her way into the role of Amelie's landlady.<br />Menu screens are beautifully done, mixing stylized cast photos and scratchy moving imagesion an easy one.

B000065U1N|2.0|I am a fan of war movies and this I wouldnt call a war. A mere skurmish. You cant help but fell patriotic as you watch this movie and want to squash the villans and enemies, but his movie just doesnt end. The action doesnt start until you are about 45-60 minutes into the movie. It good too much hype, and it was a total let down for me.
B000063V8R|3.0|This is a great set of Star Trek out on Dvd and one of my favorite seasons.  I've not purchased this season yet and not sure yet if I will because of the price.  I have purchased the first season and several seasons of the X-Files but was very surprised when Buffy season two came out at half the price of both shows!!  So in spite of a great set being out I just feel like somehow taken now paying that much.  I'm still giving this DVD set 3 stars all for just being a great show on dvd but as for marketing I've now seen what a full season of other shows with great quality can be sold for.
B0000042HV|4.0|Tout à fait simple, c'est un merveilleux quatuor qui a su s'engloutir dans la pathétique et fascinante bulle, unique à shostakovich, nous faisant savourer chaque facette de chaque mouvement constituant les quatuors de D.S..  Le tout petit trouble est à l'enregistrement, à la prise de son je crois, puisque dans toutes les plages du coffret, un léger vrrrrrrrr!, à très bas volume est en constante présence, ce qui limite quelque peu les possibilités de l'écoute.  Malgré tout, ce coffret constitue l'une des meilleurs verssions des quatuors de D.S., Je le conseil donc à tous.<br />(laissez vous pénettrer dans le gouffre du huitième quatuor, l'un des meilleurs versions, la meilleur parmi celle que j'ai entendue.)
B000002MG1|5.0|This album has my vote for one of the best rock albums of all time.  From start to finish, this is an album that can be described many ways: lush, beautiful, dreamy, haunting.  It caps a logical (but stunning) progression from Green through Out of Time, but is certainly the most accomplished- even when compared to the great Out of Time album.<br />It's R.E.M.'s most reflective album yet, but it never sounds subdued.  The orchestration on Drive gives the song an epic feel, but R.E.M. never lets the arrangement get pretentious, instead giving the album (even the rockier Try Not to Breathe and Ignoreland) a feeling of being sweeped over by a brush of orchestral paint.  But at the soul of each song is an acoustic sound and Stipe's lyrics- both of which are pushed to the forefront for maximum effect.  <br />However. for the prospective buyer, I suggest you forget the analysis and just get this cd into your player, sit back for 50 minutes and listen.  And then listen again.  With an album this perfect, it's time well spent.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I would have given 4 stars for the movie itself; but the DVD is excellent piece of work. Great selections are put together on &quot;Special Features&quot;,which is as much fun and intresting as the movie itself. you can watch the deleted scenes, more than 12 scenes by the way, with/without comments by director/commentetors. Interviews, behind the scene actions,ect., that is all great work. So if you watch the movie and like it, I stronglly recommend you get it on DVD too.
B000002MU3|3.0|Going through the R.E.M. catalogue, once you reach monster you've reached some difficulty.  One reason is that Monster is a difficult album.  The two albums leading up to it are rock classics, with Automatic for the People being a contender for \\"the best rock album of the nineties.\\"  Both reviews are easy to write- you pen \\"incredible\\" and \\"buy this now!\\" and you have 100 other ... reviewers saying nearly exactly the same thing, and then (if you want) you can find critics with their \\"top 10 of the decade\\" lists to add to the pile.  <br />But R.E.M. takes a drastic and necessary departure from their acoustic sound, with mixed results.  Fortunately, the heart of R.E.M. is still there on this album- the songs are for the most part terrific. The best tracks are the down and dirty love-sick anti-ballad \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\", the dreamy, sexy \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\", and the roaring lament for Cobain \\"Let Me In.\\"<br />But there are some drawbacks too.  Stipe lyrics focus almost entirely on the sex factor in relationships, and the sound matches the lyrics; its very ragged and seems to almost drag along concrete. But this gets tiresome by the end of the 40+ minutes.  And they use that guitar reverb sound ENTIRELY too much: 5 tracks to be exact (Crush, Bang, Name, Circus and You!) <BR>It's a mixed bag, but there's enough there to definately give it a few spins.
B00003W8NM|5.0|After months of hearing the hype for this film i finally gave in to the pressure and bought the DVD. WOW!!.....This is honestly the best movie i have ever seen! I have watched it at least 40 times now and EVERY time I see something else that I missed.<BR>  Without ruining the ending, let me simply say that if you think this is a macho movie about fighting, you are dead wrong. It's psychological. It's deep. After watching it many times you start to see the simple wisdom hidden in it. The lines are uttered on one level but resonate on many deeper planes...<BR>  Tyler is pushing Ed Norton to wake up and see things as they really are. But he won't. And we can all relate to him. We are educated, have good jobs, a good life, but something is missing...<BR>  This is a great film, not simply guys fighting.<BR>And the DVD is excellent. you can view the movie with the director, actors, scene designers, and writers. You learn a lot from that. plus, on location filming of the movie and all the publicity that went along with it. After watching everything this DVD has to offer, you will know more than you thought you ever wanted to know...
B000002LOE|5.0|Out of Time is the perfect title.  Released in 1991, into a world dominated by the spectacle of Michael Jackson and the angst of Nirvana, Out of Time was perfectly out of step with the times...  That it became their hit was simply coincidence; R.E.M. had been making incredible albums for almost a decade.  <br />But, in fact, many fans do seem to hold that this album is where R.E.M. \\"sold out.\\"  One listen to this record should demolish that point of view.  A stab at airplay is not made with mandolins and organs.  Out of Time is a very dreamy, reflective album.  Its  the musical equivalent of fine wine and fall colors.  It's an unseasy mix of both bitterly somber (Losing My Religion, Low and Country Feedback- Stipe sings \\"it's crazy what you could've had...\\" with such longing it's simply heartbreaking) and fervent optimism (Near Wild Heaven, Shiny Happy People.)<br />And, after a decade, it's still firmly out of step with the times.  But that's not quite true; more accurately, this beautitful album is \\"timeless.\\"
B000068QY7|4.0|First off I would like to state that the criticisms of Oasis are hackneyed and old.  &quot;Oasis rips off the Beatles,&quot; Oasis is unoriginal.&quot;  Please it has all been said before and that was nearly 10 years ago!  You would think a band that &quot;rips off&quot; other bands would either be sued or would not be tolerated by discerning music fans. (I said discerning music fans so obviously most American music fans don't count.)  In addition just because a band changes their sound ever so slightly does not mean they have lost it, all great bands have one thing in common: they do not remain static.<BR>Now to the album.  This album shows us that Oasis still has the ability to produce in your face hedonistic rock and roll while retaining the ability to produce meaningful ballads.  While &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; may have been their first single, I believe that &quot;Hung In a Bad Place&quot; tops it in rock and roll prowess.  Having said this, clearly the cream of this CD is the beautiful &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out.&quot;  On par with &quot;Slide Away,&quot; &quot;Wonderwall,&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away,&quot; this song is one for the books, a clear sing along at any concert.  My advice, go buy this album and include it with the other Oasis must-haves on your shelf.  Cheers
B000067CPX|5.0|...so I could be a bit biased.  I think I could walk away from them if this CD wasn't any good but fortunately I don't have to worry.  It offers up diversity not previously seen in their work, Flea is just as magnificent as ever (although you do have to listen through the music to hear him, he doesn't solo much), and the lyrics are great!  I listened to this while flying from LA to Sydney and never had the urge to change CD's.  If you liked Californication for it's hard rockin' style, you might like this a bit less, but if you're a true Chili fan you will love this.
B000001F6S|5.0|This recording shows ALL four players striving to reach a peak. There are no heroes in the band at this time. All four were given and decerved rave reviews for their playing, Ric, Chick, And Leo were phenominal. Alvin..well he was comming into his own as a superstar, but at this time in history it must be remembered that this was a band effort NOT Alvin Lee and Company. I'm sure all four men would agree with me that the band was at it's peak in the jazz-blues field, then turned to ROCK to find a larger audience. Having had conversations qith Ric, Chick and Leo. they all agree this was TYA. The the dowhill spiral began.  It took another 20 years before the band would put out out About Time . Which to me was a great comeback cd. Dan Jasper
0312979479|5.0|I was recommended to read Agathat Christie's books by my private school's principal.  I am a very avid reader.  I was constantly running out of books to read.  My mother bought a book with five books in it, this one being one of them (though it goes by it's other title, Ten Little Indians).  At first I was confused with the characters, constantly looking back to the character page to see what the character was like.  After a couple of chapters I was captivated with the story of these ten strangers in a curious house.  I didn't put it down all day.  It kept me captivated the whole time, with a twist at the end!  A great read for an mystery lover!
B00005YU1O|3.0|This DVD is worth owning if only for the gorgeous animation. Many of the scenes have eerie trance-like sequences that remind you of Chagall. It's a perfect way for Linklater to make an interesting film, considering his fondness for street-philosophizing. So it's too bad that the dialogues (mostly monologues, actually) contain ideas that sound like regurgitated musings of discontented grad students gathered at a cafe. It's no way to drive a film. I'm not a proponent of 'plot-must-drive-the-film', but the ideas expressed in this film are unoriginal and even worse, highly stilted and formalized. Nevertheless, the film world needs more Linklaters who are unwilling to bend to the confinements of the Hollywood standards. It's just a shame that this movie, for all that it could have been, turned out to be an exercise in gab expressionism. If you are a stoner philosopher extraordinaire, this disc is a must-buy. If not, this film is rent-worthy.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I was sure I wouldn't like it going in but I was pleasantly surprised. Wonderful storyline, great acting, and an old-world charm.
B000001DVD|5.0|I would never trash Pyromania or Hysteria, as they too are '80s hard rock classics that I will forever love.  Nonetheless, it kills me how many people who claim to be Def Leppard fans overlook this album.  My review of \\"Vault\\" (their greatest hits collection) gives that album of amazing all-time classic hits only 4 stars--mainly because all but the ballad \\"Bringin' On The Heartbreak\\" are ignored from this album.  This to me is the defining Def Leppard album in many ways.<br />\\"Let It Go\\" is an aggressive hard rocker with a metal edge--a great lead off to the album.  \\"Another Hit And Run\\" is also a fantastic hard rocker, and then comes the amazing title track.  To this day, I can't help but bang my head to that classic song.<br />\\"Switch 625\\" is a hard rocking instrumental.  Songs like \\"You Got Me Runnin'\\" and \\"On Through The Night\\" continue the metal edge with the over the top melodic vocals and crunching guitar riffs.  \\"Lady Strange\\" is one kicking song as well--listen to that guitar solo!  Man...all these tracks are rocking and amazing!!<br />As others have mentioned, this album is Def Leppard before their polished sound truly came to be.  While that is true, these guys always had a melodic sensibility about them--even on this early, relatively non-mainstream album.  All I can say is trust me--if you haven't heard this you have been missing out on one of the classic hard rock albums of the past 25 years.  Def Leppard may have become a pop-based band later on (including on their soon-to-be released \\"X\\", as I have heard it).  To me, there is nothing wrong with that as long as the quality musicianship is there, which it has been with these guys for the most part.  They have a right to change with the times.  However, it will never get better than the early efforts from this band.  This album is a true highlight in this legendary band's amazing career.  Don't miss it!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I recently bought this cd. I never listened to the first one, but I have to admit this one takes the cake. It has everything, from the depressed to the upbeat. Personally, my favorite tracks are &quot;Like a Pill&quot;, &quot;18-Wheeler&quot;, and &quot;Lonley Girl&quot;. I think what I like the most is the personal feeling you get from hearing these songs, since Pink cowrote them. In a world where most singers have their songs written for them, I find this an impressive step. Overall, this is definetly worth your money. Now I'm wonder what Pinks gonna do next!
0441009425|5.0|With his first novel, Reynolds has stepped to the front of the hard SF pack.  This is better than Benford, better than some Poulsen, better than some Poul Anderson...it's an excellent book.  The characters are well developed and his writing is engaging (and often loaded with VERY big words...take note!).  Furthermore, the science is as hard as it gets in the genre with snippets of info on neutron stars, weapons systems that use graviton pulses, etc.  The story is cohesive and isn't squandered with useless filler.  The story's suspense is captivating and when &quot;revelation&quot; is required, it's given.  And ultimately, the book satisfies at the end...no neat little tie ups like Reality Dysfunction.  Buy this book!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this cd only a few days ago and have played it continuously since then.  I first heard Norah Jones on the radio with &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and decided to take a chance and buy the album.  I was pleasantly surprised with her mixture of wispy and strong vocals.  Her rendition of &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; is a throwback to the smoky jazz club atmosphere.  This is definetely an album you enjoy a bottle of wine with.
B0000640VN|3.0|I am a Meg Ryan fan, but this really isn't her best work.  For about half the movie, she comes off as a really unlikeable character.  Her character seems to be a bitter ex-girlfriend who can't leave her ex-boyfriend alone when she first meets Leopold.  Throughout the movie, you do warm up to her, but you're not exactly cheering her on.<BR> <BR>What really saves this film is Hugh Jackman and the fabulous supporting cast.  Jackman is magnetic as Leopold; you can't take your eyes off the guy.  His character is everything a woman could want - charming, polite, smart, and sincere.  Did I aslo mention gorgeous?  He seizes conversations with a mere word, and finds the time to chase down purse snatchers. <br />I'd recommend this as a good film for a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nowhere else to go, and you need a love story.  It has its flaws, but it does keep your interest til the end.
B00005R2M3|1.0|Before she was just a normal talented dedicated musician . ...P>I am sorry but Shaki needs to get a life and ... the only thing left for me to say is THIS CD IS GARBAGE AND IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE SONG ...BR>DON'T BUY IT!
0380730367|4.0|I discovered Mr. Lehane when I picked up Mystic River on a whim.  In that novel, his character studies were so rich and well written, I immediately went out and purchased all of his other books.  Perfect for &quot;beside the pool&quot; summer reading, I have completed all of them in less than three weeks.  In my opinion, this is his best.  Same quick, sharp, humorous style as the others, but Prayers for Rain, I thought, offered the most challenging and curious plot.<BR>My best advice, actually, if you are willing to devote the time, is read them all. And, if you do, read them in order.  If your taste for detective mysteries doesn't run that deep, I would introduce myself to Mr. Kenzie and Ms. Gennaro right here with Prayers for Rain.  I bet it will make you read at least one more!
B00005QIPH|4.0|There are a few things I can see to be bad about this album. One, it has no originality, true music critics, including myself, agree about this fact. They are a mix of velvet underground, rolling stones, and maybe some creation, IMO. But, the tunes are good, without a doubt, and so are the lyrics. You might have a problem with the image these guys try to create, and the fact that they fashion themselves artists. But no doubt, this is not disappointing if you just listen without trying to wear it down and criticize. And as one other reviewer said, it's a welcome change from the downward spiral in mainstream rock today.
0790729628|2.0|Everyone else is doing it, why not Blade Runner!<BR>Where's the Special Platinum Collector's Extended Director's Editorial Criterion Collection Super Duper Edition of this CLASSIC film?<br />Heck, even George Lucas has given in and started releasing the Star Wars movies (the new ones, of course) on DVD.<br />This DVD is terrible.  It was among the first releases on the new DVD format, and by contemporary standards, it's just awful.  No remastered audio or video.  No special features.  The only thing that could make it worse would be if you had to flip the disc part-way through the film.<br />For the love of all that is good and holy in this land, PLEASE give us a SPECIAL EDITION of Blade Runner!
B00005OAIE|5.0|This young man must have an old soul, 'cause he sings with such purpose, passion and meaning.  Every track is enjoyable and it's good to read in the liner notes that he acknowledges his debt to Michael MacDonald.  Frankly, I think Mayer goes his mentor one better with this sure-to-be-remembered debut CD.  Most single artists cannot hold my attention track after track, but the gifted John Mayer is a refreshing exception.  A must-have for your collection.
B000007MVD|4.0|Reviewing anything by the Beatles is a sucker bet.  Considering both the quality of their music and the degree of lingering effect they have on modern culture, you can't find a band that outstrips the Fab Four.  But sometimes you wonder how a group of this sort could have gotten to be so great and influential.  Well, this album displays their pedigree for all to see.<br />Every one of these tracks was cut in a BBC studio before being aired.  Thus, they're live in the sense of having been recorded all at once, rather than in the sense of being performed before an audience.  And thank heavens for that, because the live performances were famously difficult to hear over the screaming -- even the Boys themselves couldn't hear their own monitors right there on stage.  The effect is almost like hearing a private concert coming live over the radio.<br />Most of these tracks are quite short, in keeping with the short attention spans suffered by radio listeners.  That's okay.  the tracks also tend to overlap, the way radio tracks do.  Don't expect to be able to make mix tapes with this album.  How about that -- a CD that by its very nature discourages piracy!  EMI probably saw dollar signs when they screened the mix of this album.<br />Most of these songs are covers.  We've heard some of them before, in the more polished (some might say sterile) studio recordings.  We already know how they handled Carl Perkins' \\"Matchbox,\\" Arthur Alexander's \\"A Taste of Honey,\\" or Little Richard's \\"Lucille.\\"  Here, though, we get a feel for the rough, energetic sound that must have existed for them when they performed live on stage.  We also get to hear new covers -- \\"Carol,\\" \\"Sweet Little Sixteen,\\" \\"The Hippy Hippy Shake,\\" and \\"Memphis, Tennessee,\\" among others.  This really gives us an opportunity to see how the Beatles developed from a struggling bar band doing covers for tips and drinks, to the greatest force in the history of recorded music.<br />The recording quality on many tracks leaves something to be desired.  Some were cut on one- or two-track systems that sound like the instruments were being played inside a tin can.  Others sound rushed and haphazard (never mind the statement in the booklet notes that it took sixteen tries to get the feedback at the front of \\"I Feel Fine\\" right).  Still, enough of them are good to keep listening from being painful, and all are at least interesting from the viewpoint of fans in good standing.<br />Some of the spoken tracks are interesting, but seem like throwaways.  Thanks to the magic of the CD player, it's possible to program around most of them, and thank heavens, because some of them descend into inanity.  However, they're listenable at least once or twice, with the famed Beatles banter that endeared them to the Radio-listening and TV-watching public back home in Britain.<br />This is an imperfect album, not really up to the level of their studio work when they were still a going force.  However, for Beatlemaniacs, fans, or even just casual listeners who are familiar with the Liverpool Sound, this album is a fair investment of funds.  Love it or hate it, this album is an influential addition to the Beatles canon.es something to be desired.

0743455967|5.0|Inspiring.<br />This book is a \\"must read\\" for any would-be writer.  It is slathered with dos and don'ts, pet peeves, and anecdotes.  It had such an effect on me that I really changed my whole philosophy on my life.  I totally reevaluated my priorities, my dedication to the craft, and my love for putting words to paper.<br />Please do not pigeon hole Stephen King and assume that this book has not literary value because of his preferred genre.  This has nothing to do with death, killing, or anything of the sort.  It is a love story of the most artistic sort.<br />A love story about a man and his passion for writing.  A thing that he loves so much, he took the time from his busy schedule to share it with us.  For that, we're very blessed indeed.
B00005QIPH|2.0|Well, it's not horrible.  I'll give it that.  Given the rest of what's popular today (e.g. N-Sync, Limp Wristed, er, Biskit), I can even see where this might seem, dare I say it, great.  It's not. <br />The best I can say about this disc is that it's adequate.  I've heard criticism regarding the \\"rich kids start a band\\" thing, but that doesn't even enter into it.  This work is just not up to the hype surrounding it.  It is, in fact, very much a product of this time:  this music relates to classic New York Rock (The  Velvet Underground, the New York Dolls, etc.) in the same way bands like N-Sync relate to the Jackson Five.  Obviously rooted in N.Y.C. circa 1969-78, the music shows little of the spit and fire of the originals.<br />Passable tunes played passably by scruffily attractive young men.  That's about all there is here.  And goodness knows, I have many friends who count themselves fans.  I cannot for the life of me see why.  Well, I suppose I can.  After such an unremitting onslaught of [stuff] on the airwaves, ANYTHING that doesn't outright stink seems pretty fine.<br />Still, I'd recommend any of the original source material, or just go get \\"White  Blood Cells\\" by the White Stripes.  Less filler.  More fire.

B00005JKNF|3.0|GOSFORD PARK is ostensibly an English country-house murder mystery, but in fact the murder plot is incidental to the film, which is really an examination of class relations in Britain prior to World War II.  And therein lies both the strength and weakness of GOSFORD PARK.<br />Like most films by Robert Altman, GOSFORD PARK sports a large cast (the film is extremely well-acted) and the camera wanders among overlapping conversations forcing the viewer to piece together what is really happening.  It is hard to follow, and probably only makes sense after multiple viewings.  <br />The particular strength of GOSFORD PARK lies in its recreation of life in an aristocratic country manor.  The screen writer, Julian Fellows was writing out of personal experience, and the filmmakers employed individuals who had once worked in such a house as cook, maid, and butler.  From the mechanics of running such a large household, to the intricacies of the dress code, and the elaborate codes of etiquette, GOSFORD PARK offers a stunning glimpse of a style of life that few of us know first-hand.  <br />The weakness of the film is that it has no heart.  It is meant to be a commentary on the social distance between the classes, even as they lived in close quarters to one another.  But there is this pesky murder plot line, and while the disinterest of everyone in the film as to who actually \\"dunit\\" may be a commentary on the social mores of the day, the fact that even the protagonist in the end seems almost indifferent when she \\"solves\\" the crime lends a certain moral dissonance to the project.  Indeed, at the end one is left wondering whether or not she might someday find herself romantically involved with a person who is entirely unrepentant about having stabbed someone in the heart with a knife. <br />It is impossible to be deeply involved in a film in which there is no moral order at all.  We are simply left watching a large number of people pursuing their interests, with no reason at all to care about what happens to them.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Critics, critics. So many like &quot;Mr Wright&quot; are often too judgemental of new artists. Certainly these critics that are so eager to bash a new artist also realize just how difficult it must be to produce such quality music. That is, of course, if they actually tried. So what if he sounds similar to Dave Mathews? So what if he's young and expresses himself in a way that shows his age? Do you think John Mayer contemplated even once..&quot;Maybe I should keep my music to myself since I sound  similar to someone else&quot;. I'm glad he didnt. How many of us &quot;older&quot; fans have truly enjoyed seeing the development of greats like Eric Clapton? More power to ya John Mayer! For a debut album, John Mayer, you must be very proud of your accomplishment and I'm eager to see how your talents develop.
B0000022WA|2.0|This movie is okay.  The storyline is cute, but I would reccommend the more recent version over this.  In this the twins are older then in the other one.  Their tricks on the soon to be bride of there father are not nerly as good as the ones played in the newer version.  Lindsey Lohan played more believable twins then Hallie Mills did.  I liked the way the parents acted towards eachother in the new one.  They were calm and polite.  In this one though they were slapping, cussing and throwing fits whenever they were in the same room together.  It was also very long and some parts were rather boring, while in the new version everthing is interesting.  One thing I will say for the old version is that I like how the song &quot;Lets Get Together&quot; is in the movie unlike the new one.  But I would say if you could see the new one then just stay away from this version.
052594527X|5.0|Chevalier has done for this painting what well researched historical fiction does for history: taken a beautiful painting from a museum and brought it to life. She has given it a story that makes the reader wonder if this could be true, and if not, what can be seen in the picture that would tell the story of this girl-the one with the pearl earring. <BR>Griet is just 16 years old when she is sent by her family to clean the studio of the famous painter, Johannes Vermeer. Since her father was blinded in an explosion in a tile factory, Griet must support her family by living and toiling as a maid in the Vermeer's rich home. Resented by Vermeer's wife, only Griet can enter his studio to clean, for she can do it with an artist's eye, replacing each item with the precision with which they were originally placed for a painting. She sees her hands age years from the hours of soaking, scrubbing and ironing for a family who does not appreciate her perfectionism. Her pleasure comes when she labors secretly for her master, mixing pigments in his workroom, now her bedroom.<BR>Strong undercurrents of sexual attraction and restraint are the force de vivre in this creation: she is always waiting for him and he caring so much for her. He is bound by marriage and morals of the time, but he is also bound forever to the girl in the painting, the one with the pearl earring- the way the light plays with her eyes, her just slightly parted lips, and a wisp of hair.

B00005QIPH|2.0|Originality? Nope. Talent? Nope. Good lyrics that make you think or are at least are well thought out? Nope again. Strike three. This album's out. The Strokes had the audacity in the first place to act like an indie band, and they still act like it. Yeah they may look cool and act all mellow and have this \\"we're not in it for the money\\" attitude but they are most definitly the opposite. For starters, the lyrics are atrocious, and are quite possibly some of the worst scribbling any band has ever done. The melodies are nice and catchy (sometimes), but for the most part there is no attention grabbing tune that makes you think, \\"Man, this rules!\\" A huge letdown is what I'd call this album, as the way peopl are hyping it up. Listen to the Beatles, Velvet Underground, heck, listen to American Boychoir before you listen to this piece of [stuff]. Fake indie at it's most average. If that's attainable....
B000066I6N|5.0|I have to say that this cd has the stuff that zeppelin had.<BR>the tightness of this band is well heard, and the voice of robert is very pleasing. I was waiting to hear a cd like this from robert plant. I have to say this cd is one of the best CD's robert has put out to date! the different fusions are wonderfull and the music very catchy, the mysterious sound like zeppelin, and of course the flow is spectacular. This CD is a must have!
B000066JES|5.0|First and foremost let me say that this is an amazing record.  Over the past 7 weeks, it has seldom left my CD player.  I know a lot of \\"true\\" Manowar fans were a bit disappointed by this album, but let me tell you, you will not find a more devoted fan - and I love it.  I've been a loyal listener of these guys for 18 years now and this is some of their finest work.  True, I could have done without \\"An American Trilogy,\\" and \\"Fight For Freedom\\" smells a bit too much like propaganda, but otherwise this baby smokes.  The last 3 tracks are as good as anything they've EVER done.  The opener, \\"Call To Arms,\\" is destined to be a Manowar classic.  So pay no attention to those who dislike this album.  They're probably the ones who want more piano ballads like \\"Courage\\" anyway.  Brothers and Sisters of True Metal will love it.
0671027344|5.0|Like Holden Caulfield, Charlie, the wallflower mentioned in the title, seems to float through life with no direction. However, Charlie has a lot more support backing him up than the protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" ever did. Charlie's a freshman and has got a bunch of seniors for friends, who take him on adventures like his first real party, doing drugs and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Charlie also has siblings and a kind new English teacher who tells him \\"You are one of the most gifted people I have ever known.\\" The story is told by Charlie himself to an unknown stranger in a series of letters and imparts a tender ache, like the Smiths songs he is so fond of.  This novel explores issues of family, betrayal, and what how true friends, once estranged, can find their way back to each other. Charlie is a drifter of sorts, an observer of people and life who withhold s his opinion often to his detriment. However, it's not foolish to have hope for this boy who assures his anonymous pen pal \\"Please believe things are good with me, and even when they're not, they will be soon enough. And I will believe the same about you.\\"
0446608955|5.0|This has to be the best book I've ever read! It's heart-warming, inspirational, a tear-jerker, and makes you look at love/life through a whole new perspective. It's about a young man who falls in love w/the most unlikely girl that he would ever date, Jamie, a preachers daughter, who is free-spirited and just a great person. This book showed a meaning that will stick w/ us forever- a lesson that needs to be learned, and through the book, you see these two people go through the experiance of life and loves unpredictable miracles.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This was the most exciting, action packed, yet human, of any superhero film made to date.  For overall quality, it is second only to the first Batman movie with Jack Nicholson's over the top portrayal of the Joker.  It blows away the cheezy Superman movies.  The top three of the genre, in order, are Batman, Spider-man and the X-Men. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as the socially awkward Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe is a tremendous Green Goblin/Norman Osborn.  The special effects, acting and screenwriting warrant five stars.
B000002U82|5.0|The work that brought Pink Floyd millions in pounds (British Money), dollars (American Money), and fans (People Who Adore Their Music). But though Pink Floyd incorporates video clips and expensive lighting effects to their shows at the time, they always cared for the fans. That's why they put out this masterpiece, Dark Side Of The Moon. With the usual subject matter used by bassist/vocalist/songwriter Roger Waters; madness (\\"Speak To Me\\", \\"On The Run\\", \\"Brain Damage\\"), death (\\"Time\\", \\"Eclipse\\"), drugs (\\"Breathe\\", \\"Any Colour You Like\\"), war (\\"Us And Them\\"), and money (\\"Money\\"), together with guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour, keyboardist Richard Wright, and drummer Nick Mason, and with some sound effects put in together with Roger and engineer Alan Parsons, Pink Floyd made up what they didn't think would be their greatest album, but did become their greatest and highest selling album.<br />The album was originally a song leftover from the Meddle sessions, called \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", which as 1971 came to a close the song blossomed into a half-hour long song suite called \\"Eclipse\\". Roger wanted to called it \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", but the British Electric Blues Band, Medicine Head, also did an album called \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" the previous year (1970 for those not paying attention). After a year the Medicine Head album failed to chart, so Roger revived \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\".<br />Fresh off of doing a movie soundtrack for Barbet Schroder called \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" at Honky Chateau Studios in France (at which 2 songs; \\"Burning Bridges\\" and \\"Childhood's End\\" came to be re-written and incorporated into \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" as \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Time\\"), and the \\"Live at Pompeii\\" video, Pink Floyd decided to play \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" on the road and see what happens. The first night at the Rainbow Theatre in London's Finsbury Park, the band did a few old songs then did Dark Side Of The Moon, up until 2 minutes into \\"Money\\" it was going great but then the power went out for a few minutes and they couldn't start again where they left off, so they had to play Atom Heart Mother in place of the rest. The Next 2 nights went off without a hitch, so they went to many places in Europe, Japan, and America, and in later 1972 they went into the studio and started on recording. The Album was released in March of 1973, and went to Number 1 in Billboard Charts at the end of the year. The album went Gold (100,000 copies sold) in May of 1973 and went Platinum (1,000,000 copies sold) in October. At this moment the album is now gone platinum 28 times (or 28,000,000 copies sold). It is the 2nd highest selling record of all time, 1st being Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" having gone platinum 30 times, and 3rd being \\"The Wall\\" having going platinum 23 times.<br />Dark Side Of The Moon has been played in its entirely on stage for 3 years from 72-75. \\"Money\\" and \\"Us And Them\\" were played on stage as the encore for the '77 tour. \\"Money\\", \\"Time\\", \\"On The Run\\", and \\"Us And Them\\" were played on stage for the A Momentary Lapse Of Reason Tour (the first tour without Roger Waters) from 1987-1990. Dark Side Of The Moon was revived in it's entirely for the 1994 tour, in which David Gilmour covers Roger Waters' singing parts, rather splendidly, on stage for \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\". On the October 20th, 1994 show (the one recorded for the P.U.L.S.E. Video) Roger showed up to see them perform, and Dave went to him and invited him to play on stage for Dark Side Of The Moon and the encore (Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, and Run Like Hell).

0440213525|5.0|Okay, I'm not a completely qualified Grisham fan having only read half (six) of his novels, but this one ranks near the top of my list, anyway, just below the sensational The Rainmaker and slightly above The Pelican Brief. I imagine this book will stay the near the top of that list for quite some time.<br />I found the book good on several levels. The plot is simplistic, but one of those \\"what if\\" scenarios that I'm sure many writers had thought about before but never voices. What if a child overheard important information in a criminal case and refused - for whatever reason - not to tell. In this case, that child is Mark Sway, an eleven-year-old trailor-trash type with a single mother who struggles to make ends meet for Mark and his eight-year-old brother Ricky. Mark and Ricky stumble across a man on the verge of committing suicide, try to save him, and the man spills the beans on why he's committing suicide - he's the lawyer of a much-sought and dangerous Mafia man who's hidden the body of a dead senator. The lawyer tells Mark where the body is and then proceeds to kill himself, just as he'd intended to long ago.<br />Perhaps what I liked about this book so much was that the main character wasn't a lawyer. Usually, Grisham's novels (at least the one's I've read) have had a lawyer as the main character, and it's told through a lawyers eyes. Here, we see everything with a child's innocence. Mark may be very mature for his age (having helped his mother file for divorce from his abusive father, among other things), but he still has that inner child that adds something to every scene - the questioning about whether to lie or not, the regret afterwards, the thoughts of his mother and his brother (who went into shock after seeing the suicide) and wishing he was back on a playground where things were simple, even the more mature thoughts of who he could trust. It's very easy to care for this child. I was with him the entire way.<br />The Client kept me interested. It wasn't predictable. Many of the scenes were quite funny, actually. Grisham develops fantastic dynamics between several of the parties involve - Reggie and the FBI, Harry the Judge and the FBI, even the mob members don't get along. And it doesn't dwell too much on the legal aspect of it, I'm sure everyone'll be happy to hear, and whenever it is used, it's brought down the child's level. Still, assuming Grisham actually knows what he's talking about, I did learn a little bit about the \\"system\\", as I would hope to from a novel that uses it. But it's only there to propel the stories and the characters forward.<br />Overall, I recommend this to any Grisham or non-Grisham fan out there. I started reading The Rainmaker last summer thinking I would set it down within half an hour, but I ended up finishing it in under a week. I'm not normally a fan of legal thrillers, but he's a fabulous, concise and easy-to-read author who has a knack for creating original and compassionate characters. Every once in a while you'll find a good moral, too, although he never preaches it to you. For this novel: Watch you say.
B000002J1U|5.0|With Led Zeppelin 1 &amp; 2, Led Zeppelin was considered a heavy-blues band, but this album (appropriately entitled Led Zeppelin 3) adds to their genre repretoire with glazes of folk/rock (&quot;Tangerine&quot;, &quot;That's The Way&quot;), Country/Rock (&quot;Celebration Day&quot;, &quot;Gallows Pole&quot;, &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot;), Rocking Ballads (&quot;Immigrant Song&quot;, &quot;Out On The Tiles&quot;), and Middle-Eastern Tastes (&quot;Friends&quot;), but still maintaining a blues edge (&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;, &quot;Hats Of To (Roy) Harper&quot;).<br />Using these songs, Led Zeppelin was able to add something new to their concerts, Acoustic Sets. It would always be Jimmy Page on Acoustic Guitar, John Paul Jones on Mandolin, Robert Plant singing with an occasional tambourine to shake, and John Bonham playing bongos or shaking a tambourine himself.<br />Led Zeppelin 3 brought Led Zeppelin more fans in, ones who enjoy folk music. Who knows what will come next after this stunning masterpiece? Well why don't we walk up the &quot;Stairway&quot; and see.

Songs like \\"More, More, More\\" and \\"In Your Eyes\\" transport the listener to a time when dance was king and rap was just talk on the streets. Similar to her previous album, \\"Light Years,\\" Kylie has proven that she is a bonafide diva in her own right. <br />With a variety of musical styles such as \\"In Your Eyes\\" (trancelike dance single) to \\"Dancefloor\\" (fun, early eighties feeling), \\"Fever\\" is definitely Kylie's best work to date.

The film follows the main character, starting with a graphic birth scene, and transposing us to her adulthood as she begins a quest to find company and a place in the world. Much of the films feel-good appeal comes from Amelie's clever tricks and gags, including a home-alone like stint in an angry grocers home. The films visuals are nice, with some beautiful shots, and the sound track is excellent as well. Amelie's gently plot and lack of much conflict may not appeal to some viewers, but provides a nice relaxing movie. I wouldn't recommend watching it with the kids though, it's rated R for excessive amounts of sexuality.
B00005T30L|2.0|Ghost World is the kind of movie you love to hate, at least if you're me that is. The people I can see enjoying this movie are bitter, outcast teenagers who resemble the two main characters, and seem to be the exact audience this movie was made exclusivly for. The film chronicles the adventures of two young women who have a tendency to be sarcastic and bitter towards everything and anything. The films plot lacks any direction and the ending is worthless. The film gets 2 stars for decent acting and a few interesting segments. An alright movie to rent on a rainy night, but certainly not seeing more than once.
B00003CXE6|5.0|A wonderfully intriguing and complex story.  I agree with those who didn't see all there was to see the first time through.  Indeed, it was after the third or fourth time through that I realized movie wasn't really about arena combat at all - The bloodthirsty gladiatorial combat is simply the backdrop against which are played the two major themes: saving Rome in accordance with the wishes of the dead Emperor Marcus Aurelius as well as saving to from the despotic clutches of his biological son, Commodus; and the second theme that develops as the now slave Maximus wants disparately to join his murdered wife and son in the hereafter.<br />Crowe (Maximus) and Phoenix (Commodus) are set against each other and you get wound into the battle between good and evil, honor and betrayal, loyalty to an ideal and Commodus' despotic avarice born of jealousy and huge insecurities.  Often overlooked in the critiques, but also very good is Connie Neilsen, the multi-lingual actress from Denmark who plays the part of Commodus' sister Lucilla.  Her apparently long-dormant and now reborn affections for Maximus sets off Commodus, who vainly pursues an incestuous tryst with her throughout much of the movie.  <br />Rebuffed at almost every turn and correctly fearing that Lucilla has plotted against him, Commodus eventually dares to enter the arena to fight Maximus...  A bit far fetched; however, according to the historians, the real Commodus would from time to time show his \\"bravery\\" by going down on the floor of the area to personally administer the final blow to an otherwise incapacitated gladiator - the real Commodus was apparently every bit the coward of the movie version.<br />Great movie -  Crowe, Phoenix and Neilsen give wonderful performances in this larger than life epic.  Destined to be played again and again at my house.  The sound track alone is worth the price.
0385720920|3.0|This book feels a bit like a few steps backward for ole' chuck.  Fight Club was good, but not as good as everyone says.  Survivor was really good(in the beginning) and then got very gimicky.  And thsi one? Well all of the above except it is sporadically good and sporadically juvenile, and gimicky.  If you haven't read any of his works, you may like this o.k., but if you have, it will sound like a bit of a rehash instead of an evolution.
B00005QW4K|3.0|I made the mistake of thinking that a bootleg edition of Army of Darkness would only improve on a great thing.  However, much to my dismay, it only made me want to watch the regular edition.  The movie is great, to those of us who have a sense of humor, but I recommend a pass on this edition and move towards the classic.
B000001EUR|4.0|This album is begins the Scorpions decent to &quot;formula&quot;, commerically driven metal.  Although still superior to 90% of the metal music available at the time, this album could be considered Scorpions-lite. This is where I began to hate metal ballads.<BR>If you already own the previous three Scorpions releases, you are obligated to purchase this to round out your Scorps collection.  For the unitiated, start with &quot;Lovedrive&quot; or &quot;Blackout&quot;.
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch at times can be a confusing film maker.  He can also be a boring film maker.  However, in this movie, which I felt to be more confusing then Memento, David Lynch gives a present to the audience.  He creates a movie that will cause all those watching to spend the next few days obsessed with the film trying to determine what happened.  I came into the movie, knowing that it was going to be confusing, most of the way through the movie, I felt that I had a handle on the film.  But, Lynch throws a twist into the movie that causes intelligent movie-goers to scratch their head.  With that said, the beginning is a little slow, and the movie does take a little effort to get into, but once you are engulfed, the movie cannot go long enough.  A must see to those looking for a movie that requires thought.
B000001EUL|5.0|The pinnacle of the Scorpions career and arguably one of the best heavy metal albums of 70's.  Features a guest appearance by the &quot;Mad Axeman&quot; and original Scorpion, Michael Schenker.  Klause Meine delivers his best vocal performance.   Finally &quot;Lovedrive&quot; introduces the world to Uli Jon Roth's successor and superior, Matthias Jabs. As Jerry Lee Lewis would say &quot;All Killer, No Filler&quot;.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|If you are looking for a good adaption of H.G. Wells, The Time Machine, please look elsewhere.  The movie does not try to stay true to the book in the slightest bit.  Other than the special effects, which is nothing new, this movie does not bring much to the table.  The ending was rushed, and did not appear to be thought out or explained.  Overall, I turned off my TV disappointed when the movie ended, almost to the point of being mad.
B000001EUP|5.0|Along with &quot;Lovedrive&quot; this album cements the Scorpions into the  position of Germany's top metal band.  The guitar sound  on this album is a virtual blitzkreig assault delivered thru  overdriven Marshall amps;  heavy metal period.   Matthias Jabs is one of the most under-rated metal guitarist.  He can hold his own with Michael Schenker and blows Uli Jon Roth clear out of the water.  Most importantly, this album stands the test of time and is as powerful today as it was 20 years ago.  For the &quot;younger&quot; generation of future metal-heads out there; this is a can't miss purchase.
B000002PH1|5.0|This album represents Belinda Carlisle at the most popular, most confident stage of her career.  Following the success of her solo album release, she tells us &quot;I'm not afraid anymore,&quot; and declares that &quot;nobody owns me.&quot;  After all, &quot;our love is all we need,&quot; and Belinda was basking in the love of both a rather newly-wed husband and a legion of new fans.  This album is a declaration of self-worth and possesses some really anthem-like qualities, although the central theme is still love, of course.  I love this album so much that I can still remember when and where I bought it when it was initially released.<br />If you accidentally program your CD player to select tracks randomly, that will not be a problem with this CD; every song is wonderful, and there is always a good chance you will hit one of Belinda's biggest hits.  &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot; topped the charts, while &quot;I Get Weak&quot; and &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot; were top ten smashes.  As good as these three hits are, I personally don't think they are the best songs on the album; in fact, I consider the wonderful song &quot;Circle in the Sand&quot; one of the weaker tracks on the CD.  My favorites are &quot;Should I Let You In?&quot; &quot;World Without You,&quot; and &quot;Nobody Owns Me.&quot;  Most of these songs are fast and beat-driven, which is somewhat unusual for a Belinda CD.  &quot;Nobody Owns Me&quot; is definitely a song to get you pumped up and ready to tackle the world again.  Still, though--and this is an eternal theme with Belinda Carlisle--love is what is really important.  Personal strength requires love, she seems to say: &quot;I Get Weak&quot; celebrates rather than condemns such weakness; &quot;Should I Let You In?&quot; addresses the importance of making your own choices and avoiding bad relationships; &quot;Fool For Love&quot; declares that love is worth making a fool out of yourself for.  Heaven on Earth is a little unusual in that it features only one slow, romantic song from Belinda; but after an album full of upbeat, energetic tracks, the soft and sweet &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; is a perfect culmination to this artist's most successful album.features only one slow, romantic song from Belinda; but after an album full of upbeat, energetic tracks, the soft and sweet &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; is a perfect culmination to this artist's most successful album.
071198042X|3.0|It would have been amazing if Peter Freestone had met Freddie Mercury five years earlier,unfortunately he did when the band Queen started to fade into musical chaos. Peter gives us here not only an account on Freddies professional life but also the sad side of superficiality of the relationships of a man so rich and at the same time so lonely. My only complaint is the rather tedious and long description of Mercurys home, at one point I really felt like I was reading an antiques shop catalogue! Its interesting to notice how such big music projects such as Queen, work mostly based as corporations, socializing between members was non existent for what we are told. Freddie never read books and never watched the news on television according to Mr. Freestone, I feel disappointed that probably he didnt care about all the misery going on around the world even though he was sitting on a mountain of money. An interesting book but not an essential reading for fans.
0380788624|5.0|Cryptonomicon is an excellent book that integrates facets of history, technology, politics and cryptology.  This is an intellectual book that will appeal to readers with an interest in, or background in, science and mathematics.  Neal Stephenson has the unique ability to integrate many disciplines into a story that is entertaining, educational and meaningful.<br />I highly recommend this book and look forward to Mr. Stephenson's future writings.
0451167716|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet and say that in my opinion, Mario Puzo's &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the greatest fictional work of all time. I've always been a person who likes to read, but I almost never found myself getting into the &quot;classics&quot; of American literature that every schoolteacher makes you read in the 11th and 12th grades. This book, however, grasped me and pulled me in, entwined itself around me and did not let go until I was finished with it. A definite 5-star classic that surpasses even the greatness of the original Godfather movie in nearly every way.

B00004RI87|5.0|well, although it doesn't have quite the scope that kyuss had, but hell, who could touch kyuss? but this isn't a bad review, not in the least.  unida is by far my favorite post-kyuss group (though i though slo burn had good potential).  i never was into singers that could actually sing, but john garcia won me over.  he has a great voice, great lyrics, and a pretty cool stage presence (though he's been wearing the desert storm camouflage pants for like 10 years straight now...)<br />this album is currently in my car cd player.  the only song on it that i'm not too impressed with is dwarf it.  eh, it's not bad, but i usually skip it.  other than that? this is an ideal driving record.  the last track is definitely one to cruise down an dark desolate road to.<br />so in closing, this band/album kicks my ....  and they don't disappoint live, that's for dang sure! thank you mr. garcia and friends!

B000067CPX|3.0|I knew that the Chili Peppers wouldn't be able to touch the material that they released on their best album to date, 1999's Californication. However, By the Way is still a highly infectious effort, backed up with intelligent lyrics, an amazing band & a chemistry that can not be denied. When these men hit up the studio, you know that you will get a hit every single time. After 3 years of high anticipation this super group returns with their latest album.<br />The first single \\"By the Way\\" is absolutely fantastic. It features the two sides of the Peppers blended perfectly together: mellow acoustic rock & straight up heavy rock. The album's best track however is \\"Dosed\\". The track is incredible and would have fit perfectly on Californication. The boys are leaning more on the mellow rock music on this album however, which is clearly evident on \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"This is the Place\\", \\"Don't Forget Me\\" & \\"I Could Die For You\\"<br />The first group to really hit us with the rock-rap mixture, keeps their reputation strong mixing in songs like \\"Can't Stop\\" & \\"Minor Thing\\". The material is also still very futuristic, and the boys still love trying new things. Perfect Examples of this are songs like \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Throw Away Your T.V.\\" & \\"Venice Queen\\". Two songs that you should definetly check out also are \\"Midnight\\" & \\"Cabron\\".<br />The Red Hot Chili Peppers were hot in the 80's and prove that they have amazing staying power in this industry by remaining to be one of music's best acts in the present times. Their rebelious attitudes has put them in a catigory all their own, because unlike all the other rock acts out there now, they refused to follow guide-lines that were pre-set and follow their own legacy. Maybe thats why so many bands have fallen off and the Chili Peppers are just as spicy now as they ever were.
B00005JKL8|3.0|It is a very entertaining film, and Hackman & Wilson are great in it. What the movie lacks is \\"impact\\" if you will. Burnt out soldier goes out of territory, gets shot down by bad guys. The rest of the movie is minimal dialog, only average suspense, and overall pretty formula action movie. The sets & action itself are great, but after the movie it doesn't leave you with any aftertaste. An hour+ of chase, they save him, bad guys get it. Next please...<br />With a name like Hackman & the obvious talents of Owen Wilson, more could have been done, but it's a great movie for sittin' in front of the boob tube & not having to think or pay attention much. Some of the DVD's deleted scenes should have been left in the movie (actual dialog which the film lacks) and more behind the scenes would have been nice to see, the visual aspects of this were great.
0380730367|3.0|If you're expecting another MYSTIC RIVER, think again. This is genre fiction, a hard-boiled mystery/thriller in the tradition of Robert Parker. PRAYERS FOR RAIN is also the fifth in a series with the recurring characters Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.<br />  At the beginning private detective Kenzie helps Karen Nichols discourage a stalker. Six months later, she's dead, having jumped from the top of Boston's Custom House. Several weeks before she'd died, Kenzie had neglected to return her phone call, and he feels guilty. He can't believe the same girl (A fifties type with the personality of a Barbie Doll) had become a drug-addicted prostitute.<br />  I always like to reread the blurbs when I finish with a novel, just to see if the reviewers actually read the novel. One mentions the \\"wonderfully rounded characters.\\" Bubba Rogowski, a former special forces operative, is about as rounded as Rambo, and Angela and Patrick aren't much better. They're former partners at the beginning (she's working for a security company), but it doesn't take much foresight to know they'll be back together shortly. The dialogue also bothered me quite a bit; it's supposed to be snappy, but Lehane doesn't know when to quit, and the characters all have the same voice (Lehane's).<br />  There are some pretty good fight scenes in the beginning, but I was disappointed by the climax. One thing about series novels: you always know nothing too bad is going to happen to the main character. We also have, count them, three villains. Lehane had me really hating Cody Falk, the original stalker, but he's soon replaced by Karen's step brother and then by this postal clerk who seems to be impersonating the step brother.<br />  I was really amazed at the difference between this novel and MYSTIC RIVER, which is darn near perfect. At first I thought this might be an early work, but Lehane actually wrote A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR, DARKNESS TAKE MY HAND, SACRED, and GONE, BABY, GONE before this one, so I guess you have to blame it on the genre.ss you have to blame it on the genre.
B000001FMC|3.0|A few memorable tracks make it worth the purchase at under [price], but some of it is forgettable early '90s fodder with the bonus track editions not being of much substance.
B00005LB9O|3.0|As a whole, this CD is adequate.  If you do not have a Travis album and are thinking of buying this because of 'Sing', consider their second ablum, &quot;The Man Who&quot; instead.  'Sing' is a fabulous song and it may be worth it to purchase this CD, however the fact is that the other songs are only tolerable.  Travis hasn't shown me much other than &quot;The Man Who&quot; (which I rate 4.5 stars) and have lost their place as one of the better Brit Pop bands.
0060090367|5.0|Watermelon is SO FUNNY. I first read this book about 6 months ago. It has since made its rounds through friends and family (at this date about 10 people have read it). Everyone LOVES this book.  Claire and her quirky family are all incredible, unforgetable characters. Highly recommended!
B00005R87Q|1.0|What the hell is going on? People actually think this is a great movie? Why go to all that trouble to steal a bunch of DVD players? Hey Vin, I know you're not the smartest but here's a tip - deal drugs, there's more money in it. An utterly shallow and ridiculous movie that is based entirely on Vin Diesel being attractive to the opposite sex. And maybe gay guys too but I haven't asked. Not that he is required to 'act' at all. That would get in the way of him looking moody and mumbling a lot.
6304233639|5.0|This was one of the largest grossing movies at the box office when it was released in theatres in 1996, and it is still fun to watch on video.  ID4 is loaded with futuristic special effects, such as the destruction of the Empire State Building and the U.S. Capitol. Other effects, such as the large alien ships and the dogfight sequences between aircraft and alien ships make this a fun movie to watch.  Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman give first-rate performances throughout the movie. Smith, the fighter pilot, Goldblum, the scientist who discovers the weakness  of the aliens, and Pullman, the President of the United States who just happens to be a retired Gulf War fighter pilot who gets another chance to fight the bad guys.  The special effects and the actors make this a movie worth watching several times.
0312265859|5.0|This book was long awaited, and bet your dollars I was the first in line to get it. The only disapointment that I have is that now I have such a long wait until  number nine. Although I was waiting for grandma to do something crazy she seems to have calmed down Im guessing for a great big blow out. Cant wait until the next. I wish I could find some of Janets older romance novels she wrote in the early days. I hear they are just as good.
B00003CXXP|1.0|In all honesty, A.I. was one of the worst films I've seen.  I was very disappointed to see that any of Kubrick's bright ideas were overshadowed by lengthy and excessively corny Spielberg scenes.  I felt myself not caring about any of the characters and wishing the film would end (which it takes a very long time to do.)  Finally, towards the end of the movie you are in for a surprise when you think that it is over and instead it launches into the final scene.  This is when I turned from simply disliking the movie to utterly hating it.  Please save your money and your three hours.  And if you absolutely must see it, don't say I didn't warn you...

B00003CXI1|4.0|I thought this movie stayed quite close to how I had envisioned the adventures of Harry. There is a truly marvelous cast in this one, and the sneering Alan Rickman is worth a rent on its own
6305181772|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! The first &quot;M:I&quot; I ever saw was &quot;M:I-2&quot; which I liked of course. But this movie is better as far as plotting. The second one is a straight forward action movie. This is a true espionage thriller with great acting to boot. The special effects were amazing also. The train sequence was truly a sight to behold. The scene in which Etahn Hunt(Tom Cruise) breaks into a high security CIA vault is nerve-wracking to watch. I reccomend this movie with high regards. As the theatrical trailer says &quot;EXPECT THE IMPOSSIBLE&quot;.
B00000I8BX|5.0|This Fear Factory CD may have been the one that made them more popular amongst the heavy metal world, but this is by no means a mainstream release. This CD is just amazing. I've had it for about 3 years now and it still hasn't lost the power it had the first time I heard it and was blown away by the opener \\"Shock\\". The thing about this CD is, tracks 1 through 10 (the regular songs) are almost like a story or a movie. The way one song goes into another perfectly and it all seems to tell one big story about machines and the end of mankind and that kind of thing. It's like a movie. The inside of the booklet even narrates the CD like it is a movie. And the musicianship is awesome. It is still the signature FF style with the relentlessly heavy guitar riffs, pounding drums, and bass with the vocalist's powerful growl mixed with his melodic singing which sounds evil as hell. And the bonus tracks are a must have. \\"Cars\\" was re-made wonderfully, \\"Where Evil Dwells\\" is evil and heavy and could've fit perfectly on Soul of a New Machine which is death metal and \\"Concreto\\" and \\"Soulwound\\" have almost all singing and they sound especially dark, and \\"Messiah\\" is another great heavy song. This CD is a must have for any FF fan or metal fan.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Being a fan of the ever-popular Resident Evil video game for both Playstation and Gamecube, I found the movie to be somewhat of a disappointment in that aspect, however for a movie alone it does an average job. The actors do their best to interact with the obviously bland and remarkably unoriginal plot, and the special effects make for some excellent scenes. <br />The movie is cohesive in the respect that I saw how the writers didn't make the fatal mistake of taking the famous game plot and drive it into a movie, they used the names of a few key events and objects (Umbrella, T-Virus, Raccoon City) and rebuilt the movie to fit into two hours of action that didn't require puzzle solving and boring backtracking (though you see in the movie less than thirty different scenes I think!) <br />The movie is a good fling for some entertainment (but if your a gamer, don't expect Jill or Chris to blow anything away!) The movie made its mark as yet another video game-movie transfer and it ranks, like its previous attempts, mediocre. I think that the game to movie idea needs some more time to develop, after all the average video game lasts three to sixty hours now, so movies are a bit pressed for a descant transfer!
B000069KGM|5.0|THE CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY was released by The Chicago Transit Authority in April 1969, three months after the band recorded it.  Produced by James William Guercio (as were their next 10 releases), TCTA is the exciting debut by the band soon to be known simply as Chicago.  Robert Lamm, Terry Kath, James Pankow, Lee Loughnane, Walter Parazaider, Peter Cetera and Daniel Seraphine were all in top gear for this recording and working towards the same goal: to create something different and musically exciting.  Their quest worked.  Originally a double record set on Columbia/Sony, Rhino has re-issued it in vastly superior form and sound.  This alone makes it worth revisiting, let alone re-purchasing, even if you have the old CD.  For the hits-conscious, &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot;, &quot;Beginnings&quot; and &quot;Questions 67 &amp; 68&quot; (all written by Lamm) appear here - in their longer formats.  Which brings to mind the rest of the album: all extended and imaginatively-arranged by the band.  Terry's &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; (the type of track that you'll appreciate, or skip over immediately) is only telling part of the story.  This is really a &quot;free form&quot; album.  &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;Poem 58&quot;, their foot-tapping cover of &quot;I'm A Man&quot; and the socially-conscious &quot;Prologue, August 29, 1968&quot;/&quot;Someday (August 29, 1968)&quot; are all wonderful examples of that much-loved time when Chicago let their instrumental muse run free and weren't hindered by the 45 r.p.m. single format - because they were NOT about having hits in 1969. Even for those who are turned off by their slick '80's hits (which are still good), give this a spin and be dazzled.  For those who already know the music contained within, any classic is worth revisiting - especially in such an improved re-issue.  What a glorious start...
B000002U6E|3.0|I hate reviews that rave and then never describe the music. So I set out to correct this. This was a pretty good album overall, with weak and strong spots.<br />Second Chapter - a brief intro that is an Enigma trademark, flows nicely into Eyes of Truth, which is an excellent track. However, the unwavering repetition of the vocals in the 2nd track could have been changed to deliver more impact. Oh well, maybe next time. <BR>Return to Innocence is a classic, what can I say. Beat, voice, chanting, you name it, you got it.<BR>I Love You, I'll Kill You starts off slowly and dangerously, morphs into guitars that don't belong there, and then slide back into drums and vocals that save it and wrap it up. This better come back as a cool remix someday!<BR>Silent Warrior - this one was weak, with a 'rainforest' sound that don't match the mood of the whole CD. This one could get tossed<BR>Dream of the Dolphin is very piano-ish, I don't know where it came from. It doesn't fit either<BR>Age of Lonliness and Out From the Deep are both solid songs that echo the theme of renewal, innocence and change<BR>The Cross of Changes - good solid vocals and music. Does this sould slightly bitter to anyone? It fits the theme, but I would not have chosen to end the CD this way.<BR>Overall, the shining tracks are 2, 3, 4. The rest blend and fade into the background if you are not paying attention. Worth a listen.
B000069KE0|5.0|In January 1970, Chicago issued their second, self-titled album.  Again, it was a double.  Again, it was produced by James William Guercio.  And, again, CHICAGO was, and still is, a fully satisfying follow up to their equally dazzling debut album.  Due to its place as the band's second album, it is commonly referred to as CHICAGO II - but that's really a nickname.  Being adventurous again, Chicago decided to feature three &quot;suites&quot; on their sophomore set.  The first, James Pankow's &quot;Ballet For a Girl In Buchannon&quot; is a wonderous creation, and notable for unintentionally birthing two of the band's most beloved hits, &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot; - both sung with feeling by the soulful, black-sounding Terry Kath - the late guitarist many compared to Jimi Hendrix, but whom never quite received proper credit.  Terry's classically-influenced epic, taking in &quot;Prelude&quot;, &quot;AM Mourning&quot;, &quot;PM Mourning&quot; and &quot;Memories Of Love&quot; showed that the band could also be versatile and not rely on their horns to make an artistic statement.  Robert Lamm's &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; (again sung by Terry) was another call-to-arms akin to &quot;Someday&quot; from the first album about social injustices.  Lamm was also responsible for the band's biggest hit thus far, &quot;25 Or 6 To 4&quot;, which is now firmly regarded as a rock classic.  The first slew of songs (&quot;Movin' In&quot;, &quot;The Road&quot;, &quot;Poem For The People&quot; and Terry's outstanding &quot;In The Country&quot;) may seem like the appetizers before the main course (the suites), but they are all wholly-satisfying songs.  Not much to criticize here at all.  CHICAGO peaked at # 4 in the weeks after its release and ended up as one of the top selling albums of 1970 - and justifiably so.  Rhino's remastering has improved what was a muddy-sounding CD beforehand and the improved graphics to go along with it make CHICAGO, aside from its great music, a very advisable purchase.
B000063V8S|5.0|I have been a Star Trek Fan my whole life. Everything from Startrek The Motion Picure to UPN's new Enterprise. I love everything Star Trek. I even own one of Commander Riker's (Jonathan Franks) Original uniforms that was auctioned at a Star Trek Convention. My point is, Star Trek TNG was the best television series ever on television. I now own the first 3 seasons on DVD. If you don't already own those seasons buy them. I have also shopped around for these DVD sets, Amazon has the best prices I have seen, and thier free shipping is fast. As far as season 4 goes, From what I rember of watching it on tv. It was as good if not better than season 3. This is a must buy. I can't wait for it to come out. Also a note to Paramount, if you guys read this note, you should strongly consider doing a Voyager DVD season set too. But when you do Voyager, release them all at the same time, will ya? <br />\\"Live Long And Prosper\\" ~Lt. Spock
B00003CXZ4|1.0|Take a 12 minute student film, chop it, recombine it 8 different ways in a moviola, toss in some hip, noirish narration, the riveting gimmick of having the guy with amnesia tattoo essential data on his body so he can never lose it, lots of artsy affectation from the MTV '90s style book, an oblique/patently meaningless story, and voila, you have the cult hit of the new century. <br />Was I wrong to be less than charmed by this notably fashion-conscious, arch film editor's trick flick? I will leave that up to you. It could very well be that this will prove to be the Citizen Kane for a whole generation-to-come of film makers, that style will continue being pushed over substance to a point that films that tell stories will simply cease to exist. My more modest guess, however, is that as stinting as Memento is with feeling, this will become the dust collector in most people's DVD collections, the film that one half of virtually every couple out there despises and refuses to watch a second time. It is an extremely low yield experience in emotional terms. Gimmicks wear out, even the good ones, and leave empty wireframes behind. Think of Memento as Roger Rabbit for the new millenium. The search for the perfect film continues in perpetuum.
B00005QXDD|4.0|I hope these guys consider it a compliment that I would compare them to Frank Zappa, because I mean it that way.  There has been very little stuff since Zappa's death to compare to what he used to do, which is why I was delighted to hear this one.  After Jack Black's charisma came through in the movie \\"High Fidelity\\", I was very interested in what he could do on his own.  I was happy to see that he records stuff that goes along with his public personality.  <br />So we get an album that is partly rock music, partly comedy.  Sometimes the comedy bits coincide with the songs, sometimes not.  The topics of both include drugs, religion, sex, more sex, and rock and roll itself.  This is not the whiny, bratty stuff done by kids who have nothing to complain about.  This work is done by what seems to be seasoned veteran's, who maybe also have nothing to complain about, but have at least been around the block a few times and know what they're talking about.   <br />I left off a star because I would like to see a little more music.  The drive-thru skit has worn thin after several listenings, and would last better if put to music.  Also, cut down on the swearing, only because it lessens the impact nasty words provide when used in moderation.  But other than that, this is a funny, well done album.  I hope to see more like it.

B000059ZLH|4.0|First, Dream Theater are not a Heavy Metal Band, they are a Progressive Rock Band, so if you are into metal, this may not be your cup of tea.  However, if you like complex rythmns, time signatures, chord progressions and music that is devoid of \\"fluff\\" then this could be the DVD for you.  There are few bands that come up to the level of Dream Theater, Rush is one of the few that pops into mind.  Besides, Rush has had a heavy influence on Dream Theater.<br />I have seen DT in concert and this DVD does the band justice.  The atmosphere is excellent and the visuals great.  If you are a musician so much the better, as you can learn by watching what goes on, on stage.  Mike Portnoy is, as usual a master of Progressive Rock Drumming.  As for Bass and Guitar watchout for the weak of heart.<br />It is great to see a great band put out DVDs even if the sound quality is less than perfect.  I just want to see them and revell in their talent.<br />Wonderful DVD and if you want to check out other cool stuff get Mike Portnoy's Liquid Tension Experiment.
B00003CXI0|4.0|Movie looked and sounded just like what you see in the book. However, ALOT of things were left out. I know that if you put everything in the movie, moviegoers would be there for four hours. But that was what I was looking for!
B00005JKED|2.0|The problem with this film is that is was more designed as a vehicle for Washington to show off his tremedous acting ability than to actually create a solid story.  Even the best actor can be limited by a bad script which is what happens in this movie.  Denzel Washington is in my opinion in the top 5 actors of modern film, but a movie like this just doesn't give him the room he really needs to stretch out and show off the amazingly varied characters he can create.  But, of course, this was the Academy's year to award the black actors (Washington and Halle Berry), both of whom are much better actors than their oscar winning roles showed them to be.  If only the academy had given them oscars for the roles they truly deserved, then the academy wouldn't have to award less than stellar roles out of guilt.  Any Denzel Washington role is still better than 90% of the other roles out there, but his better roles (Hurricane, Malcolm X) lie in the unawarded 10%.

B000002H5I|4.0|Tracy Chapman's debut album contains three all-out, undeniable classic songs - &quot;Fast Car&quot;, &quot;Talkin' Bout a Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Baby Can I Hold You,&quot; the latter being one of the most subtle, beautiful songs I've ever heard.  The rest of the album is also quite enjoyable and is arguably the album that brought about the serious attitude that developed towards female singer/songwriters in the 90s.  Highly recommended if you're a fan of Peter Gabriel, Crowded House, Sarah MacLachlan, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, or other artists that deliver heartfelt, honest songs that also happen to be catchy.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is theatre as it should be. It is a feast for the senses, an enthralling and captivating spectacle that entertains, exhilarates, and grips the emotions. This is more than a movie: It is an experience. On more than one occasion I almost wanted to rise to my feet and applaud. For this reviewer, at least, Moulin Rouge was an absolute riot.<br />For those who think the musical genre could never work again, save in the context of a Disney cartoon: Think again. The movie-musical receives here a glorious resurrection. Musical numbers are pulled off with style, wit and imagination, and the tongue is never far from the inside cheek, meaning that we never feel we are watching a movie that belongs to an earlier time. Tunes are drawn from an entire century or more of music, often hilariously executed (if I tell you that Madonna's Like a Virgin is staged in the mode of a show-stopping, toe-tapping Broadway musical number, you will gain an idea of the general tenor of the picture). The film's terrifically old-fashioned conventions are given a modern lilt, and are met with a refreshing and creative energy at the hands of veteran director, Baz Luhrmann (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet). Shades of Shakespeare are everywhere seen. Stylistically, we are in the surreal world of Jeunet and Caro (Delicatessen, Amelie). Musically, this is in a category of its own, quite unparalleled.<br />Don't be fooled into thinking this is nothing more than a cracked attempt at a musical revue. That was exactly the impression I had from the trailers, and it was with suspicion and hesitation that I rented this movie, at the recommendation of a friend. I wasn't to be disappointed: I had tremendous fun watching Moulin Rouge, and hope you will too.
0385335482|5.0|At first I was wondering if I could like Becky Bloomwood because she was a bit materialistic, but then she won me over. The scenes in this book were hilarious and the characters were well-developed. Foreshadowing and appropriate climactic moments were strategically placed to make a very interesting read. I couldn't put this book down and finished it in one weekend.<br />Definitely recommended.

B00004SCBG|5.0|Much of what did make Poseidon interesting was the use of characters and settings from mythology. This was most certainly Sinfield's concept, and the idea was extended even to the album cover artwork. The intent was to perhaps draw parallels between ancient and modern times, and to employ these ancient myths as context for a greater purpose that had never been previously attempted in popular music. This tendency to use themes of a grandiose nature would lump Crimson together with several other British bands of the time into what would be called &quot;Art Rock&quot; or &quot;Progressive Rock&quot;. As work for &quot;Lizard&quot; progressed, lumping KC together with the likes of Yes, Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Genesis seemed more a matter of convenience to rock critics than anyone else. Fripp's interest in jazz became evident on this album, and his involvement in the &quot;Centipede&quot; project allowed a free outlet to this expression. Many players from this scene played on the third album: Andy McCulloch, <BR>Robin Miller, Marc Charig and Nick Evans. Jon Anderson of Yes also provided guest vocals to side two's &quot;Prince Rupert Awakes&quot;. The third album was unique in that, for the most part, Fripp tended to remain in the background, providing tasteful acoustic guitar playing while Robin Miller's oboe soared above the proceedings. What also made this album unique was the critics' reactions to it. No more wishy-washy critiques and &quot;I sort of liked this song, but...&quot;. Most critics either loved Lizard or hated it. This tendency towards outright hostility on the part some elements of the Rock Press would hound King Crimson for the rest of its days.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Synopsis: A young auto industry analyst finds an antidote to the boredom and emptiness of his life by participating in a brutal underground sport called Fight Club. As more and more disaffected men begin setting up clubs in urban centers everywhere, the movement takes a sinister turn, ultimately expressing itself in apocalyptic violence. <br />Fight Club includes a surprise twist that may make you think of other movies like The Sixth Sense or The Crying Game. But the surprise here is not built in with the cleverness and subtlety of The Sixth Sense - you won't be tempted, for instance, to go winding back through the movie trying to find clues. And that's all right: because while The Sixth Sense gets its creepy power from subtlety and sophistication, Fight Club's calling cards are brutality, attitude and corrosive humor. Like the desperate contestants in the pastime that gives the movie its name, Fight Club throws a fusillade of punches hoping that enough of them will land to make it a winner. Ultimately it succeeds. <br />The story's narrator (Edward Norton) is a twentysomething who investigates auto accidents for his employer, an unnamed car company. It's his job to calculate whether enough consumers will die horrible deaths as a result of the automobiles' defects to make it financially worthwhile for the company to initiate recalls. Not surprisingly, the young man has trouble sleeping; he spends his bouts of insomnia poring over catalogs from places like Ikea, compulsively furnishing his apartment in a quest for emotional satisfaction. For a while he finds some human comfort by frequenting cancer and disease support groups, feigning illness in order to connect with the other attendees - but that's ruined when the groups are infiltrated by another \\"tourist,\\" played to cynical perfection by Helena Bonham-Carter. Finally, on one of his frequent business trips, the narrator encounters a challenging, wildly unconventional soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) - and his life takes a radical turn. <br />The core of Fight Club is the tension between the charismatic Tyler Durden, a nihilist whose antisocial behavior spins ever more perilously out of control, and the narrator, an ambivalent character with one foot in the fight clubs and the other still in the button-down world of corporate conventionalism. Edward Norton does a beautiful job with the lead role, convincingly embodying both sides of the conflicted young man; he provides the movie with its emotional core, and holds his own even when sharing the screen with his incandescent costars. Pitt gives the film its ferocious energy and sense of danger, in much the same way Tom Cruise lit up an earlier Brad Pitt movie, Interview With the Vampire. For the part of the hard-bitten, consumptive looking Marla, Bonham-Carter provides just enough vulnerability to make her sympathetic by the movie's end without compromising her character. <br />Insofar as it focuses on the narrator's eccentric quest for human connection, Fight Club is a brilliant film. The metaphor of reaching out and touching other human beings with a bloody fist is not only inspired satire - it is oddly fitting as an emblem of our culture's increasing social clumsiness. (The only way to break through anyone's carapace of possessions, arm's-length communication devices and 21st century intellectual reserve is to beat his head against a concrete floor.) Unfortunately, the movie eventually runs short of material in the fight clubs and shifts its attention to \\"Project Mayhem\\" - wherein Tyler Durden's nihilistic vision becomes the linchpin of an improbably vast underground movement. At this point, Fight Club loses its power and focus. It is also around this time in the film that we are let in on the surprise I mentioned at the outset. Although the surprise does shed interesting light on the character of the narrator, it doesn't manage to save the last twenty minutes or so of plot development. Despite its faults, though,Fight Club is well worth seeing. Its rawness, edgy humor, and exciting performances easily compensate for the late failures of the plot.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I just wanted to say that this movie is great.  If you like zombies, sci fi action, and a cool soundtrack.  Then check out this flick.  I like it personally because I think zombies are cool, even if I do hate zombies.  Great flick.
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is the film adaptation of Mark Bowden's mesmerizing chronicle by the same name. It recounts a 1993 incident involving U.S. Special Forces in Somalia, a routine half-hour mission that turned into the longest sustained firefight involving U.S. forces since the Vietnam War. A mixed group of helicopter-borne Rangers, Delta Force, and a few SEALs, supported by air cover and a convoy of ground vehicles, converged on a busy marketplace in downtown Mogadishu in a lightning raid to capture two top lieutenants of renegade warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. The raiders were blindsided when literally thousands of Somali fighters emerged from the surrounding neighborhoods with machine guns, rockets, and other sophisticated weapons. Two blackhawk helicopters were quickly downed by rocket-propelled grenades, the ground convoy got battered and lost its way repeatedly trying to rescue the downed crews, and the entire force on foot found itself under seige until it was finally rescued the following morning. The casualties included 73 U.S. fighters wounded and 19 killed, as well as 500-1000 Somalis dead. <br />Black Hawk Down has by and large received excellent reviews, and it deserves them. For one thing, the film balances a lot of difficult things well. It memorializes the heroism of the American fighters without glamorizing their struggle; it captures the savagery and squalor of the fight in paradoxically beautiful cinematography; and it conveys the confusion and complexity of the battle while making it (mostly) apprehensible. A note about that last point: it's still a good idea to read the book before seeing the movie if you have the luxury of doing so. Before it was over, the battle sprawled over much of central Mogadishu - a large city - and encompassed several different groups of men in different sites. Director Ridley Scott does an admirable job of making sense of it all, but it will still be clearer if you read about it in stupendous (but fascinating) detail in Bowden's account. <br />Having said the foregoing, let me warn you that this is not a movie for everyone - far from it. Black Hawk Down is an exceptionally violent film. Not grauitously so: the violence is entirely in keeping with the truth of the event, and supports the themes of the film. But it's not easy to watch, all the same. One scene involving battlefield surgery, especially, is probably a good opportunity for the squeamish to hit the concession stand for a while. <br />With material like this, the ideal of character development and strong individual performances goes somewhat by the wayside. There are necessarily too many faces, and too many events going on, for the film to linger for any length of time on one individual. (If you want character development, check out A Beautiful Mind.) Still, the performances here are quite good given their limited parameters. Josh Hartnett comes fully into his own as the leader of a Ranger squad (a \\"chalk\\") who fights to keep his team focused on survival. Among the other performances, I liked William Fichtner as a Delta Force sergeant who takes initiative at a critical moment in the fight. You may know Fichtner from ensemble parts in other movies, such as The Perfect Storm, where he played the edgy outsider Sully. <br />As a film and as a historical document, Black Hawk Down definitely deserves your attention.

B000059PR5|5.0|It's hard to find too much to complain about with this jem. As scores of others have written, this was, and probably still is the most controversial made for TV movie of all-time. Right up there with \\"The Burning Bed\\" for those of you who remember that.<br />Seeing this as a teenager I was definitely creeped-out. The attention to detail and authenticity make this film a stand-out. The acting ranges from acceptable to extraordinary and the special effects-though not exactly cutting-edge, more than get the point across.<br />There is no point in going over the storyline itself. This film could have contained any one of a hundred pentagon war scenarios and been essentially the same. This film is more about people than politics. A short nuclear exchange reduces Kansas City (and the nation) to ashes. The stories of a good 1/2 dozen characters are set up and followed through this harrowing experience. We see this through the eyes of a then-unknown Steve Guttenberg along with John Lithgow, and Jason Robards. I thought Guttenberg did a good job-usually I can't stand him.<br />This film is like a 'slice-of-life' which none of us wants to experience. The atmosphere is depressing and hopeless for the most part. Perhaps the most frightening thing is the realization that it could happen so easily.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000002J09|5.0|Already owning &quot;Remasters&quot; and the &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;, I was unsure if I really needed to buy this album.  Heck, I had all the songs from IV on those albums except for &quot;Four Sticks&quot; and  &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;.  Curiosity got the better of me, and I went ahead got it.  Well, let me just say that it was worth it just for  &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; (though &quot;Four Sticks&quot; is not without its charms).  How much better can you get for a blues rock song? John Bonham drops this massive drum beat (recorded in the stairwell of Headly Grange if I'm not mistaken) the rest of the band kick in - Page's infectious riff taking the song away, Percy screams his head off, and JPJ adds the icing on the cake with his bass lines.  So even if, like me, you already have heard the other songs of IV a million times, its worth it for one song - well okay, two -  &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; and of course &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.
B000068PQ0|4.0|this album definately isnt for everyone. but if you have trouble finding anything good on the radio and/or you are a flaming lips fan you should check this one out.  you can listen to the entire cd on their website [...] before you buy it to decide if its right for you. another thing i have seen many comparisons to other bands and genres.this is not anything like trip hop.it is not like Radiohead or Bjork either, to me anyway. Although those bands are great. Flaming Lips are beyond classifications. the only reason i gave this four is because five stars is given out too much
B000002JSN|5.0|If Led Zeppelin had just made this a single album, instead of a double, it would have indeed been a shame.  Not that the album would have been any less enjoyable, but because we would not have the pleasure of those underrated gems that reside on the second disc/LP.  Should you even need to be told that the first part of this album is pure gold? I doubt it - the music speaks for itself.  However, you should be informed that the second half of this album is undeniably what makes this album great.  It's here that we see all the styles of Zeppelin represented through 9 excellent songs - mystical rock (&quot;In the Light&quot;, &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot;), fun rock (&quot;Night Flight&quot;, &quot;Wanton Song&quot;, &quot;Sick Again&quot;), country rock (&quot;Down by the Seaside&quot;), and of course blues (&quot;Black Country Woman&quot;, &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot;).  I've heard some say that these songs are just &quot;filler&quot; - songs that were left over, and needed to be used up to make to make this a double album, and give the band more money.  Any fan of Led Zeppelin will tell you this is complete and utter nonsense.  &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; is in my opinion the jewel in the Zeppelin cannon - classic hits, and underrated gems.  What more could you ask for?
B00003CXCS|5.0|This all-time classic movie finally receives the wonderful dvd treatment it so richly deserves.A fantastic anamorphic transfer and a masterful sound remix make this film more enjoyable than ever.
B000065U1N|5.0|I felt this movie right to my bones. Those others that say the characters were not developed, missed the point of this film. Other than pointing out the atrocities an American Military man may face during times of war, it steadfastly built on the same principals we all learned from the first day of boot camp until if lucky enough, retirement. Only TEAMWORK and depending on those beside you for survival is non-negotiable. Personal feelings and beliefs have to be put aside to be effective. That was a very hard, but very necessary lesson we learned from the Vietnam war, and I would bet my pay the primary reason the draft went to all volunteer. You can't object if you volunteer!! In most cases and units, \\"a Character\\" is not what you want to become because you are seen as detrimental and dangerous to your buddies lives. I think his lack of development of the characters was a precise move to maybe force us to see what those soldiers were really focusing on (bringing everyone back alive). I only wondered why the flags were backwards on the uniform. I thought it was reversed film but it couldn't have been. I've never discovered the reason for that.

0380789035|5.0|This is probably the best book I've read this year.  Mr. Gaiman has some brilliant ideas in his head, and luckly for us he also knows how to put them on paper.  After reading Neverwhere and Good Omens, I had high hopes for this book.  Well, the expectations were met and far exceeded.  This novel literaly has everything.  It is a road-trip, mystery, romance, fantasy novel.  And let's not forget about the characters.  Shadow, Wednesday, Mr. Nance, Mr. Ibis, Laura, Mr. Town, ect.  The list goes on and on.  All of these characters are real.  They all have real motivations; none of their actions came off as forced to me.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
0316666343|5.0|I found this book to be very moving.  I was haunted, fascinated, and spell bound.  I have read over 20 books this summer, and this was absolutely one of the top three.

B000007489|5.0|I like this CD, even though the song 'I Saw Your Mommy' is really mean. But the music on this CD resonates with how I feel. I mean, I just can't seem to get anything right. It's like, everything I do just doesn't work out, no matter how hard I try. I want to do a good job, be a good person, but I'm just binded by my own shortcomings. I wish I could be a real modern hero, but I just am having trouble 'Being all that I can be'. And so I guess Suicidal Tendencies plays songs that I can understand on a certain level.
B00004NJJR|4.0|Having discovered Sonata Arctica through their second Record &quot;Silence&quot;, which by the way is a pure blast, I expected their debut Ecliptica to be missing some of the elements and lack the luster of their second release. I was pleasently surprised by what i heard! The music was melodious and rich in emotion. It's a very intense disc! But their are some negative points, although not critical. The singer has an english accent that didn't really show on &quot;Silence&quot;, but does on Ecliptica and their music is less original, but very well performed. The tracks on this disc are wonderful. The ones that stand out are FullMoon, which has powerful vocals, Kingdom for a heart, My Land, the beautiful ballad Letter to Dana which showcases a medival sound(using flute), and the amazing Replica which is clearly an anti-war song.<br />I recommend purchaisng this disc and Silence.<BR>These are purchases you won't regret! As for the Japanese Ecliptica which features the extra track &quot;mary lou&quot; it ain't worth dishing an extra 32$ for an extra track unless your're a huge fan or have the money.<br />Rating: 4.5/5
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the 1st U2 Cd I ever bought and I have 2 say this is probably one of my best Cd purchases! &quot;With or Without You&quot; is one of my favorite songs on this Cd. I love the song &quot;In God's Country&quot; because to me it talks about the beauty of God's earth.<BR>&quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; is another great one. I love the lyrics and the tune of it. To make a long story short, I love all the songs on this Cd and this is a Cd every fan should own!
B00003CXBH|5.0|The impact of the movie's theatre release, has stayed with me to this day.  I regard this as &quot;my movie of all time&quot;, due to the emotional impact of the story, the visual interpretation of the Director, and combined with the powerful, stirring and, at times, fragile music that comes together to &quot;move&quot; the audience to a deeper understanding of social issues.  It is not just another example of mans' inhumanity to man, but it tells the story of a peace-loving, indigenous tribe of people caught in the path of civilisation pushing to the corners of the earth - and all the selfish traits that society brings with it.  The story is repeated over and over in modern times, where popular belief overrides those of minority opinion with the usual destructive force engineered by man himself.  Excellent direction, superb performances by de Niro and Jeremy Irons, the producers should look seriously at releasing this movie on DVD for our home enjoyment.
B000063S6Z|1.0|Sorry folks, but this guy is NOT the icon of the electronic culture. So why do thousands of people buy into this \\"playing for the people\\" pop music? What the artist is really doing is playing for the M-O-N-E-Y. MOBY in days of late has killed what was once considered the MOBY sound. If you really want to hear some good electronics, try looking for MEAT BEAT MANIFESTO's 'Subliminal Sandwich' double disc, or UNDERWORLS's, 'Everything. Everything' DVD. I apologize to all the \\"popular\\" people to having hurt MOBY's pockets... if anyone even cares to search for real music. L8TeR.

0805062971|2.0|I started reading Fight Club with high expectations, but never really got to grips with it. I found it amoral, and lacking in humour. It also takes swipes at modern (American) society without suggesting any alternative but a rather primitive response, namely responding with mindless violence, destruction and the creation of mayhem. I give it two stars because Palahniuk can clearly write well, but the whole theme of the book just put me off. And this is not because I particulary dislike books that contain violence and anti-social behaviour- I loved Burgess' brilliant A Clockwork Orange, for instance. I think the absence of humour put me off this book more than anything else.

B00005JKED|5.0|While I won't say that I liked this movie, it is one that won't let go.  I saw it in the theatre.  Watching the DVD version made me realize how vividly I recalled the film.  Any film that stays with you enough to be memorable must be good, even if it isn't likeable.  Screenwriter David Ayers (The Fast & the Furious) provides an action-packed character study with the moral question: Do the ends justify the means?  Most would answer \\"no,\\" but Denzel Washington's character Alonzo Harris has bit hook, line & sinker that whatever it takes is what he will do.  In doing that, he has become corrupt.  Ethan Hawke's character Jake Hoyt begins by saying that he'll do WHATEVER Alonzo wants, which leads to the oft repeated phrase, \\"You're my nigger.\\"  His journey in the film leads him to reject this.  Some were bothered by the contrivance that Hoyt (Hawke) stops a rape, only to have that act be the one that keeps his brains from being splattered in the bottom of a bathtub.  I didn't view it a problem.  For me, the one act of good that is done in the film produces another act of goodness, letting Hawke go by the gang contracted to kill him.  For me, it reinforces the theme that evil begets evil, and good begets good.<br />Aside from the debate of whether Denzel deserved the Oscar or Ethan his best supporting actor Oscar nomination, what impressed me with the film was the depth of the supporting performances.  One of the stars for me is Eva Mendes who plays Sara Harris, Alonzo's Spanish lover.  She was so gracious when she first met Hawke, loving to her son, sexy with Alonzo, terrified of the gunfire, protective of her son, and finally in one last shot we see her from a window whisk up her son and turn her back on Alonzo.  For a small part, she had an amazing array of levels.  I didn't pick out the actor's name, but the little boy was about as wonderful of a sweetheart as any mom could want.  Scott Glen also wonderfully plays Roger, the drug dealer who is a dear friend and fast buddy of Alonzo's, only to be shot by him when convenience dictates.  Macy Gray as the Sandman's wife does an on-the-edge cameo bursting with energy.  I appreciated the added features of the DVD.  The scene where the Hispanic guy tells Hoyt that Harris wanted him killed could have made that plot point more clear, for me.

0783225482|5.0|The film is very good but the dvd is not in widescreen format. I request to the Universal Studio, please release this film in widescreen format with DTS sound. I am a great fan of Robert Zemeicks. He always makes films based on universal truth, the truth beyond any boundry, whether you believe it or not. His other great flicks are: CONTACT, CAST AWAY, FORREST GUMP, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHAT LIES BENEATH.
0385503954|4.0|This is a very moving and profound novel.  Its true significance, and the awfulness of the sin for which Briony spends her life seeking a redemption she will never find, is not truly revealed until the end of the book.  After finishing the book, I could do nothing for several minutes, I was so lost in thought.  The beginning of the novel is hard work but McEwan is establishing a time and a place which is essential to grasping the meaning of this book.  Keep your patience - it is worth it.
B00005JKNC|3.0|The Majestic gives Jim Carrey a new movie persona. He is subtle and caring and almost not Jim Carrey in this movie. Taking the premise of  'It's A Wonderful Life' and mixing it with Pleasantville, this movie is the story of amnesia.<br />There is the wonderful performance given by Martin Landau who thinks Jim is his son and a great supporting cast around him. The story is about Hollywood back in the 50's when everyone thought communism was running around controlling everything. Even Hollywood. Carrey's character is a screenwriter of \\"B\\" (Low budget) films. He gets sucked into the controversy and is excommunicated out of Hollywood and the studio he was working at. On the way home he gets into an accident and gets amnesia.<br />He wonders into this small town and is mistaken for a dead, but not forgotten, marine who fought in WWII and turned up missing. The uncanny likeness of hi to this Marine makes the whole town believe who he is - is not really who he is. Without giving a lot away he eventually comes to terms with his \\"father\\" (Landau).<br />The movie is charming and sweet. The performances are good. The DVD also contains some behind the scenes footage and interviews as well as many deleted scenes from the film. It is a good DVD for film students on the power of editing and the production studios.<br />This film is a good wholesome film for the whole family. Not the best for Carrey and not wonderful overall but it does have its' heart in the right place.
1559277238|4.0|I listened to the cassette version of Hard Eight while driving on my vacation.  This is my first Stephanie Plum mystery and I don't often listen to books on cassette; however, my son and I both enjoyed this humorous whodunit.  <br />Stephanie tackles a case of a missing child and her mother.  Things quickly become exciting when Stephen Soder, the father and ex-husband of the missing duo, is found dead -- on Stephanie's sofa!  Exploding cars, hysterical run ins with an unsavory guy with credit card problems, and a memorable cast of characters (including a reformed prostitute and a dweeb lawyer) make this book a winner.
B000066NW0|5.0|People who say this album is stupid really needs to get a brain.  Being of the same age as Avril, and not being &quot;punk,&quot; it's refreshing to see someone who can write, and who can sing, and who can play guitar on top of it.  So what if she's &quot;punk&quot; or trashes Britney Spears who is one of the most disgusting, manufactured people in the world?  She's talented and that's refreshing...especially for me.

B00005NWM3|3.0|Nickelback made a big breakthrough with their massive smash single &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;. Taking the number one on Billboard, and becoming a massive chart hit over in the UK too, it's definitely their defining tune. Personally, despite all the hype and overplay of the song, I still love to listen to it. Which is shocking, because generally, and overplayed song gets a lower and lower opinion from me as time goes on. The song also reminds me of a great friend who also enjoyed the song and bought the album. Both of us agreed, that it was their best song, and the album was a bit rough after that. The second single &quot;Too Bad&quot; is rocking and catchy, much like it's elder sibling, but not many of the songs manage to hold the magic of these two tracks. The songs aren't horrible, but are in a very generic grungy style which has been on overflow these past few years on pop radio, so they sound played out. It's not as bad as some reviewers have said, but it's not as good as some have said either. Middle of the road on the way to something good I hope, maybe their next album will really be something to look out for. A casual fan can hope.

B000002HH2|5.0|Hardly the type of artist I would normally find myself getting into, but due catching a listen of &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; not long ago, I found myself buying this album. Though quite left field, it's still amazingly catchy and once you let yourself get into it, you'll be hooked. Several very good tracks were pulled from this release, the best including &quot;Army Of Me&quot;, &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;. Definitely a unique album, and a great listen, even for those with the dodgiest of music taste. Good stuff.
B000066NW0|4.0|What separates her from the Spears, the Carltons, and the Pinks is simply raw talent.  Not since Alanis Morissette (another Canandian rocker chck) have we seen unadulterated girl-angst.  The maturity of her lyrics is beyond her years, yet they remain accessible.  I must admit, however, that it took a few weeks to warm up to &quot;complicated&quot; (probably the albums most radio-friendly cut).  but nonetheless, &quot;let go&quot; offers a plethora of future top 40 hits.  ie &quot;losing grip&quot; &quot; sk8ter boi&quot; &quot;Im with u&quot; and &quot;unwanted&quot;  My heart holds me from giving it a 5star since she still have a lot of growing up to do.  THe music occassionally steps into repetitive territory, yet it's refreshing that she was given a chance to have so much input in a project such as this.  Every1 take notice, Miss Lavigne is here to stay.  Easily the most promising young artist to come in years.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I cannot stand Leonardo Di Gayio or any movie that he has acted in.  I again ask what is he doing now?  Nothing, hopefully because Hollywood has come to its senses and realised what a no talent pretty boy he is.  I wished that the scene where Billy Zane was chasing the two 'lovebirds' throughout the ship firing a pistol at them that his aim was better.<br />I heard a rumour that he was up for the part of Anikan Skywalker in Star Wars - Episode 2 but later rejected.  THANK GOD FOR THAT!
B000002UAX|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is some good pop music; it's agreeable, tuneful, and features great singing and cute lyrics. Nonetheless, I just don't think The Beatles match up with some of today's hit music, which includes bands like 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, Shakira, Jewel, 98 Degrees, and Silverchair. The way I see it, 'N Sync is basically a modern Beatles band....only much better!!<br />Still, I give much props to John, Paul, George, and drummer Ringo, all of whom created great pop when our dads were kids. The White Album may just be their best creation, but it doesn't hold a candle to Sync's last stellar record, \\"Celebrity.\\" Justin Timberlake is today's Paul McCartney, and the rest, my lads, is pure history. Don't miss the song \\"Ob-La-De-Ob-La-Da\\" from this record, which is all about leaving your problems in the past and having in fun in life - like Sync would do!!!<br />ENJOY!!
B00000F3KL|4.0|First a warning; a movie director has a tight schedule to shoot all the scenes in the movie and he usually reuses a small supply of vehicles to replicate many vehicles. He cannot actually destroy vehicles in one scene and have them available for the next scene acting as different vehicles. What this means is that a dangerous inaccuracy exists throughout this movie less so in the book. THE RUBBER TIRES ON THE HMMWV, 5-TON AND MALAYSIAN ARMORED CARS WERE SHOT, SHREDDED AND BURNED OFF BY EXPLOSIONS IMMOBILIZING THESE VEHICLES. Because Scott had a film to finish with limited resources, the entire weakness of the air-filled rubber tired vehicle is glossed over resulting in potentially the viewer thinking combat vehicles that roll on such weak means are tactically sound when they are clearly not. Actually this is the most important lesson from the October 3, 1993 Somalia firefight, not that our men are courageous----------as the U.S. Army is currently on a delusional suicidal love embrace with the rubber-tired armored car when it should be fielding/upgrading light tracked, parachute and helicopter deliverable M113A3-type tracked tanks that can rumble right through the weak barricades endemic to third world country hellholes that stymied and blocked LTC McKnight's rubber-tired vehicle column from reaching the trapped men.<br />Because Scott didn't show this important truth from that battle this film must be downgraded to 4 stars; the stakes are too high to continue to draw the wrong lessons.<br />The film however does show at the end Pakistani tracked M113s and medium tanks leading the way to rescue the trapped Rangers/Delta operators and the smug, ungrateful arrogance of a few of the Rangers to admit that they needed help in a cityfight from armored vehicles and other troops they think are their \\"lessers\\". A lack of technotactical humility to admit that cloth BDU uniforms and Ranger tabs don't stop bullets resulted in the call-for-help not being immediately sent after the \\"snatch & grab\\" timetable was untenable nor having a what-if plan that realized the weakness of rubber tired wheeled vehicles to overcome obstacles and enemy fire to incorporate tracked armored vehicles available from U.N. allies in the short-term and for the long-term, permanently into Army Ranger/SOF force structure. The world is urbanizing so Somalia-type environments are the RULE not the exception---high value targets that are heavily defended need SHOCK ACTION and this means tracked tanks not just infiltrating but unarmored commandos that can be pinned down by enemy fire once surprise is lost. As of this writing the Ranger/SOF community has still not incorporated any light tracked armored vehicles into their force mix, so 9 years after Somalia they are without excuse.<br />Courageous men deserve courageous thinking that faces unpleasant realities and solves problems; if you the viewer watch this film and conclude correctly that if the snatch & grab had the ground link-up force composed of tracked armored vehicles-------that by trial & error had to be sent in anyway---------that there would have been no \\"Black Hawks down!\\" at all you have benefited greatly from this movie.he \\"snatch & grab\\" timetable was untenable nor having a what-if plan that realized the weakness of rubber tired wheeled vehicles to overcome obstacles and enemy fire to incorporate tracked armored vehicles available from U.N. allies in the short-term and for the long-term, permanently into Army Ranger/SOF force structure.

B000067G3C|3.0|It's a good film if you like adrenaline and don't discuss too much its realness.  And it comes out of common action movies.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you loved the movie, Moulin Rouge, then the soundtrack is just what you're looking for.  It's so creative and well put together musically.  Ewan McGregor has a voice like an angel that will absolutely make you melt.  The soundtrack has all of your favorite songs from the movie.  I can't wait to get volume 2!
B000002GOZ|3.0|I am a huge Adams fan and know most of his music on guitar. I was excited when I heard he was doing an unplugged album because alot of his songs lend themselves to a more stripped down, mellow feel (Even though I love his rock tunes.) There were a few great tracks on here, most notably \\"Back To You\\" which was a great accoustic rocker/balad. His version of \\"Summer of 69\\" was very cool and really fit, taking on a more nostalgic, contemplative feel. One thing that surprised me was that he kept away from some of the songs I thought he would have chosen for this album, that would have really worked well as accoustic. I would like to have seen \\"Have You Loved..Woman\\" even though it was mostly an accoustic song to begin with, but the live sound would have been nice, rather than the studio feel. Some of the songs he chose to put in here I just didn't agree with. I just don't see \\"Cuts Like a Knife\\" as accoustic, and with \\"18 Till I Die\\" and \\"I Think About You\\" are sped up extremely fast and sound VERY weird! I don't know what he was thinking on those two.They were definately the main negative parts of the album I thought. The rest of the album was ok, some good stuff there, but I guess I just didnt feel the songs didnt fit well as unplugged and the addition of the pipes didn't seem to fit on some of them.
0553212443|5.0|I read this because I've seen all the media versions of it since I was born.  I wanted to see what the \\"original\\" said.<br />I wasn't disappointed.  This is BETTER than all the movies (as good as they are).  This book demonstrates the kindness, empathy and forgiveness that Christ taught us.  <br />Certainly Christmas-worthy if you ask me.<br />--George Stancliffe
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is incredible stuff.  Complex, intricate, human, humorous, astounding.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album post haste.
B000000YBQ|5.0|It is impossible, when reviewing sessions by Bill Evans, to avoid repeating ones' self. Superlatives just roll off my fingers.<br />This album in particular has 4 melodies that inspire, sooth and make you marvel at the genius of Bill Evans.<br />&quot;My Foolish Heart, 'Waltz for Debby', 'My Romance', and 'Some Other Time' are melodies that, in Evan's hands, remain clear and fresh no matter how many times you play them. There is something ineffable about this pianist's way of interpreting a tune. His understanding of his instrument, and of music itself, is just masterful, and Evans has the ability to communicate this to the listener. This is the quality of a great teacher. Not many musicians have the ability to play great and also instruct the listener as to how music should be played. That's what Miles said about Bill Evans on his first solo album. Its the truth!<br />Bill Evans' piano is merely an extension of his hands. He has the ability to translate even the most complex musical idea effortlessly, understandably, and beautifully, through his instrument and into the ears of the listener.<br />Waltz for Debby is in my top 5 of Evans' recordings.<br />There are repeats of 'Waltz for Debby' (an Evans original), 'Detour Ahead', and 'My Romance', but they are certainly worth listening to again! It just saves you the trouble of clicking over on the cut.<br />'Waltz for Debby' is a live recording. Most of the tunes are played softly, but passionately, with a lot of meaning. Scott LaFaro is awesome and Paul Motian's brushes render subtle rhytms that complement the piano. The audience behaves itself so you can actually hear the music! I think they were as spellbound as I am by the musical creation going on before them.<br />This is one of my very favorite Bill Evans recordings, a musical experienced not to be missed.<br />Buying this CD is a no-brainer if you love beautiful music, especially piano trio.
B00003CXRP|3.0|This was a great idea with a great actor that just kind of never gelled.  The scenes of Hanks on the island got more and more out in left field, and what started as an interesting look at the survival of modern man in a primative world became a study of frustration and weirdness in a man with no outside contact.    The end left you wanting...not for more, or for your money back, but just wanting something more satisfying.  Don't go in with high expectations.  2 1/2 stars
B000001IPP|1.0|This CD is terrible. I hate the vocals. They sound terrible. Really, really stupid lyrics. These guys are Clash wannabees and I do not even like The Clash! These guys need to quit. I am amazed people like this garbage.This music seems to pre-planned not spontaneous enough to be Punk. This type of music was boring when the Clash did it back in the Seventies, why rehash it now?
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Ali, a self-absorbed philandering idiot in a slow, slow movie with bad music.  Will Smith's acting was good, but everything else stunk for this film.  Please, don't waste 2+ hrs of your life on this.  I regret that I did.
B000067G3C|4.0|This movie was good but the storyline was so dumb.  I mean their couldn't have been one guy doing multiple acts on people without someone else helping him.  This movie was also the start of the no story to special effects movies leading into such movies as Independence Day and Twister.  Released in 1994 this movie made much money at the box office and unfortuantley started a trend that we still are in movies with no plots or anything to them, that is why there is an independent movies surge.  If you like action this is the movie for you but the story is unbelievable.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|U-571 was a mix of action, suspense, and history woven together well into a war movie that didn't feel like a war movie.  The plot was fairly realistic, and the pace of the movie was excellent.  A very good sleeper pick that outpaces many of the other movies released in 2000.  One of the better movies of that year.  4 1/2 stars.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie.  I think it was the cutest and soolest movie.  This movie has great special effects and has a great story.  Some of the parts of this movie will make you laugh so hard and other parts will make you cry.  Released November 2001 this movie was a suprise hit and you can see why.  Much better than Shrek, this is a much better kids movie.  I can't wait for the DVD.
B0000640VN|2.0|2 1/2 stars to this light-weight comedy/romance.  It is harmless enough, and is cute, but there is little new material here.  Meg Ryan ignores the man from the past and is too busy to see him for who he really is until her eyes are magically opened to his true nature as her dream guy.  Cut plot, and a decent date movie, but it won't make anyone's top 10 list in any category.
B00005QXXO|5.0|It's hard to explain the feeling of when you hear one of your favorite songs played differently, but it sounds even better. This was the case with the song &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;. The album version is a haunting, even at times intense, melody with unique distortions and vocals. The live version, though, is even better. The eerie sounds of electronic distortions are removed to be replaced with a beautiful, yet still equally as haunting, piano melody. The other songs are still as enjoyable as the album versions, but &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot; especially stands out for me. Unfortunately, new listeners to radiohead would not enjoy this nearly as much as those that have enjoyed radiohead's other work.
0393312836|5.0|That means real good in Nadsat - the vernacular that's based on Russian taken up by the English teens in this futuristic dystopian masterpiece.  You must viddy(see) clockworkorange.com for its Nadsat-English dictionary for the first 30 pages so that you can fully comprehend everything that's going on.  After that, you're homefree and it's smooth sailing!<br />The use of the language adds another dimension to this ingenious work that is unlike any other book you will ever read.  This book is so amazing, I don't want to give anything away.  It's Lord of the Flies, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1984, and American Psycho all mixed up into one.  Anthony Burgess creates an original, intense, and enlightening work that separates itself from the mundane formula-laden novels of today.
6305903182|5.0|Scream  is the last sequel to the thrilling trilogy. It stars David Arquette, Neve Cambell Courteney Cox Arquette, Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey and Deon Richmond. This movie is about Sidney lives all peacefully all by herself in the woods, and then she starts hearing about all the bodies getting killed by the guy in the mask in the set of Stab 3. In this 3rd chapter all the starts realize that in this chapter, all the rulse are broken! Scream 3 is the best SCREAM of all. It is rated \\"R\\" for strong horror violence, Sexuality, and strong language. It had blood, but not to bad. In my personal opinion, Scream 3 is the best scream of all because Wes Craven delivers Chills, and Thrills with out going over board with the gore. There is some, but not as bad as the 1st and 2nd Scream. If your looking for a Thrilling, Action, and Suspenseful movie, this one if for you!
0064471837|5.0|\\"Sabriel\\" is Garth Nix's best work yet. It's full of action and plenty of chills. The characters are somewhat believable, though the main character, Sabriel, seems a bit too brave to be real at times. The plot was hard to follow at first, but after reading for a few chapters, it became easier to understand.<br />This is not, however, a good book for young children or anyone who is easily frightened. There are lots of very gruesome deaths, scary creatures from the realms of the dead, and disturbing journeys through the river of death. If you are one who enjoys chills and thrills, though, this is a book for you.
B00005JLDW|2.0|**1/2 \\"Reign of Fire\\" is a no-more-than-passable sci-fi monster movie, strong on production values and special effects and weak on just about everything else.  Once again we have the typical gray-and-khaki hued post-apocalyptic world filled with burnt out cities, roaming bands of grimy-faced survivors, and enough soot, dirt and rust to make the audience feel the need for a shower once they get out of the theatre (in other words, the \\"Mad Max\\" look).<br />The apocalypse in this case comes in the form of a race of fire-breathing dragons that are awakened from their millennia-long state of dormancy thanks to a deep-drilling construction project in downtown London.  We are told that these ash-eating dragons hibernate for eons at a time waiting for the earth to replenish itself before embarking on another mission of total bio-global destruction.  This is, in fact, the explanation for the demise of the dinosaurs, though, if this were indeed the case, one might question just how this species managed to so completely avoid leaving any evidence of its existence in the fossil record.  In this kind of movie, it is probably best not to ask questions of this sort and to just go along with the sheer inanity of it all.<br />The first specimen to be unleashed is discovered by a young London lad named Quinn Abercrombie who, 18 years later, has grown up to be the hunky Christian Bale, leader of a group of survivors holed up in a kind of mountainside fortress with very little hope for a future.  That is, of course, until one fateful day when \\"Dragon Slayer\\" Denton Van Dan (Matthew McConaughey) makes his sooty-faced appearance.  From then on it becomes a battle of the minds and muscles between these two strong-willed individuals who have decidedly different ideas about how best to ensure the survival of the human race.<br />Movies like \\"Reign of Fire\\" pretty much preclude any real critical analysis.  Suffice it to say that the special effects and art direction are quite impressive throughout, the dialogue bland and purely functional, and the performances adequate to the admittedly rather unchallenging task.  And the characters are at least allowed to show their human side at times, displaying various amounts of fear, uncertainty and emotional vulnerability even at those moments when they are having to be at their most daring and heroic.  There is one truly inspired scene in which two of the adults beguile the children by acting out the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader \\"I am your father\\" confrontation scene from \\"The Empire Strikes Back.\\"  More clever moments like that would have helped make \\"Reign of Fire\\" a more distinctive film than it currently is.<br />Oh well, if nothing else, the theatre-shaking soundtrack is enough to keep you awake, if not exactly interested, at all times.  But cranking up the volume is often the first indication that a movie has very little else to offer.oughout, the dialogue bland and purely functional, and the performances adequate to the admittedly rather unchallenging task.

B00005JKLZ|2.0|Guy Pearce hardly broke a sweat in this one and minimal supporting cast meant alot of special effects. Some interesting new concepts were raised but never developed. Morlocks looked like they came from Planet of the Apes. It's a toss up for which movie was the most boring and both were pretty short.
6305907145|4.0|Didn't read the book and have no intentions on doing so.  The film itself was good.  I saw nothing politically correct about it. The actors did a good job of portraying early 19th Century English society with all its warts and largesse.<br />Watch and enjoy.
0385503954|5.0|Within 25 pages, alert readers will discover they are in the hands of a masterful writer.  Before reading this novel I had read McEwan's &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; an interesting and worthy book but far less engrossing than &quot;Atonement.&quot;<br />The first thing that struck me in this novel was McEwan's absolutely convincing rendering of his characters' thought processes and sensibilities.  The narrative is presented from the perspective of at least four characters, and for two characters the level of knowledge about what is happening changes noticeably from one point in life to another.  This is very persuasively done.<br />Quite apart from the dazzling success of the author in presenting an absorbing story and convincing characters is his ability to link the story to the nature and mechanics of writing fiction.  It is rare that this can be done in a way that would interest anyone other than a fiction writer, but in this novel McEwan succeeds in fascinating at least one reader who doesn't write fiction -- me.<br />The novel contains a wealth of impressions and ideas to ponder, long after one has finished reading.  As someone who reads 25 - 35 old and new novels a year, I would place this novel near the very top of those written over the past quarter century.
B00005JKCF|4.0|I was never much into the Spider-Man comic books,but I decided to go see this movie anyway.It turned out to be a pretty good movie.The funnest parts for me were when Spider-Man was flying through NYC shooting his webs.This may sound a bit strange,but at times I almost felt like I was right there flying with him!!!This movie dragged on a little at times,but overall I was quite satisfied in my choice of seeing this film.Can't wait for the DVD and Spider-Man 2,should be fun!!!
B000058B2W|5.0|Procol Harum dropped off the musical radar screen after 1970, but &quot;Exotic Birds &amp; Fruit&quot; is actually one of their strongest recordings.  &quot;As Strong As Samson,&quot; in particular, is one of the most beautiful rock songs I have ever heard, with a haunting organ riff that easily rivals &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale.&quot;  It is, in short, Procol's last masterpiece.
0451169514|4.0|Great book. All about the stuff that kids do in that magical tween age. Great monster too! The parallel to real life monsters that we all face is uncanny. A bit longer than necessary but with enough other stuff to keep you interested. Great climax. probably #3or 4 on my King list.
B000065U1N|2.0|I feel sad everytime I watch a war movie - blood splattered across pavements, body parts blown everywhere, too much profanity.  War & death basically leave me a heavy heart to reckon with.  That partially explains my 2-star rating --- I basically don't feel comfortable with war movies.  <br />However, there's one particular war movie that I like & that is \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  There is a core group of soldiers, whose lives, beliefs & fates I managed to follow through.  I guess that is what was lacking in Black Hawk Down.  There were just too many characters, a lot of action but inadequate room for character development.  I relied heavily on their faces to tie in with the characters they portrayed, but when they were all bloodied & grimed, & not enough stuff to make them stand out, I just got them all mixed up.  <br />I feel like it was just a collection of big names with hit movies to back them up, but nothing essential to mark their contribution in this particular film.
0060506989|5.0|I have read this book a couple of times, before it was known as a movie. I served in Viet Nam in 1969-70 as an adviser to the Vietnamese under MACV. The lessons learned by Gen Moore at this engagement was often recalled in lessons in both my Officer training and later in my mission as an advisor. This book is well written, concise,to the point and informative, written with love and affection for the troops he lead and served as well as those he oppossed. I feel this is truly one of the great factual stories to come out of Viet Nam along with works by Bernard Fall as well as others. It is a good read no matter your understanding or feelings about combat, soldiers, or the Viet Nam war. In fact one of the young officers featured in the story was instrumental in helping people in New York on 9-11-01 and I believe, lost his life there.
B00005KHJR|5.0|FILM: I stumbled upon The Wicker Man purely by acccident-never heard of its existence until I did a search for another movie on ... and this movie was recommended in addition to the one I was looking for.  I looked at the positive reviews and decided to give it a shot.  Boy, I'm glad I did!  The Wicker Man is an extremely interesting and thought provoking film despite its very low budget; in fact, because of the limited budget the movie comes off more realistic, and almost has a home movie feel to it.  But the most memorable thing about The Wicker Man is the originality of the script--I have never see another movie like it or at least one that is as well-made.  The beautiful--and slightly sinister--locations where the movie was shot will have you yearning to visit Scotland and looking to find the GREEN MAN BAR, where many of the scenes were shot.  Despite being pegged as a cult movie, the film takes its subject matter very seriously and deals with it in a very challenging manner; in lesser hands the movie probably would of come off like a bad joke and instantly forgotten.  There is a reason why people are still talking about the film today.<BR> <BR>The movie starts with Sgt. Howie(Edward Woodward)coming to Summer Isle, which is located off the coast of Scotland, to investigate the complaint of a local resident about the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison.  When he gets there and starts to ask questions about the girl, he gets nothing but evasive and elusive answers from the citizenry, obviously not embracing the presence of an outsider in their close-knit community.  The more Sgt. Howie investigates the more he sees that the people of Summer Isle are devotees of a pagan culture that worships phallic symbols and believes in free love and reincarnation.  All of this comes as an abomination to the deeply Christian--if not slightly outdated and prudish--values of Sgt. Howie.  Despite his disgust at all of this, little by little he starts to piece together some of the hard to find clues, and begins to see an more ominous picture developing--Rowan Morrison and how her disappearance relates to the failure of the crops which the community depends on to live.  All this leads up to and ending that will send chills up and down your spine.<br />Though this movie is not going to appeal to everyone's tastes, I found the story of the survival of a pagan culture in modern times and how it relates to Christianity to be a very interesting study on the way we treat people whose religious beliefs are different than our own.  But besides those more profound themes, the movie also contains elements of horror that are very subtle but just as real.  Edward Woodward gives a solid performance as the repressed Sgt. Howie, and Christoher Lee is excellent as the smiling Lord Summer Isle.  Through an ingenious script, solid acting, and loads of atmosphere, it's no wonder the movie has since become a cult classic.<br />DVD: I have the limited edition version, which features the theatrical version and the longer version without all the cuts.  I'm probably in the minority here, but I like the shorter version better.  While the longer version gives you some more background information on Sgt. Howie and Lord Summer Isle, it also slows down the film somewhat compared to the shorter version.  I was able to piece together most of the missing pieces on my own from the shorter version, while enjoying the quicker pace.  Plus, the missing parts in the longer version are not up to the visual standard of the rest of the film and stand out awkwardly.<br />The DVD also includes a little documentary on the making of the film, which any fan should not be without.  It is very informative and includes interviews with most of the major players in making the film, and how hard it was getting it released.
0066620996|5.0|The problem with alot of organizations in the USA (and probably throughout the world) is that they settle for \\"Good\\".  \\"Good\\" is \\"good enough\\".  Jim Collins points out early in his book that Good is the enemy of Great!<br />The concepts in the book make intuitive sense and Jim Collins provides excellent examples from both the business world and from the \\"real world\\".  Mr. Collins also has a great knack for bringing the concepts to life with colorful imagery such as the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\", the Stockdale paradox and the Flywheel / Doom Loop concepts.<br />This book is not only interesting to read, but also provides highly useful ideas that can be applied to almost any situation.<br />I would highly recommend this book for anyone who wants their work to really mean something or wants to be part of something great ...

B000002UKS|5.0|You buy a CD based on hearing one song from a truly disgusting movie like Varsity Blues (My Hero). That CD goes on to be one of the best produced and conceived albums that you have heard in the last 20 years.<br /> The variety of Music on this album is incredible. Hard core music like &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; to haunting songs like &quot;Walking After You&quot;. Much of Nirvana's music always appeared to me to be inspired from anger or disgust. This is not the case with D. Grohl and The Foo Fighters. Constructive anger would be a better description and the songs are finely crafted and not as raw as much or Nirvana's music.<br /> Many people writng reviews here will say that &quot;there is not a bad song on the CD&quot;. That's an understatement.<br />  Over the years I have listened to a wide variety of music from Kiss to Sinatra to Bach. Once again this is one of the finest album I have heard in years.<br />  If you are looking to expand your horizons in music I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM.<br />  Grohl is a perfect example of an artist who evolved after leaving a highly succesful venture. Rare but amazing in the outcome here.
B000069AT7|4.0|As a \\"Star Wars\\" fan, I have to admit, George Lucas' 1977 grand epic movie DID NEED to be fixed, Lucas totally buffed up its Special effects, which it needed, SW Special Edition is phenominal compared to its original version, however I don't feel the same way about E.T., I mean what really needed to be fixed????, SW was Sci-Fi, so naturally it needed it, E.T. had very little effects in the way of visuals, I don't know what Speilberg is thinking, I mean, is he trying to compete with Lucas in a friendly way??, You can bet I will be watching the 1982 version, this film really is a timeless classic about an alien left behind on earth who soon befriends Elliott, a 10 year old who lives in what appears to be the valley of Los Angeles, Elliot & E.T. share a special bond, it is every lonely kid's dream, I was 11 when I first saw it, it hit home, because at the time I was new in my neighborhood, & my mom had just gone through a divorce too, I was an only child too, so you can imagine, E.T. always heightened my spirits, this film is great in that it shows what a fun character E.T. could be, the original puppet used was by all accounts well done, why they felt the need to digitally enhance E.T. is beyond me, we have never seen Jar Jar Binks as a puppet, so we don't think much about it, but E.T. you do, had digital technology been possible in 1982, then maybe it wouldn't matter, but now it does, another flaw is the removed guns from the government agents, (another mistake), why be politically correct??, I mean lets face it, agents hell bent on capturing an alien would not be so kid-friendly, in all reality they would be pursuing with guns, not walkie-talikes!..., Speilberg should have left this treasure alone, I can understand Lucas' argument on SW, but this one had little in the way of visual effects, I say stick with the original version & skip the 2002 version, the original may cost more, but it is worth it.
B00005YTFG|4.0|A wonderful, fun place to be if you are in the mind set of those in the movie.  The extravagance enhances the drama and makes you believe in love.  Fun and tragic in an exaggerated scope of overindulgence- get lost in the story and feel the characters lives, all of them.  It will teach you another lesson of how to accept that all of us, all the world is connected.  What will you do with that knowledge?

B000065U1N|5.0|A very accurate portrayal of the mess the U.S. let the United Nations get our soldiers involved in. It was a sad loss of life for a country of animals. Somalia was at war then and it still is today, our U.S. government, Bill Clinton, sent our troops in to attempt what the U.N. failed to do.<br />It is a good movie that depicts honorable young men and their valor and dedication to this country and their fellow soldiers. It should act as a lesson to future politicians that the U.S. troops are not trained or designed to serve as &quot;peace keepers&quot; for the world.
B00004Z459|1.0|It's hard to knock Linkin Park.  They're five perfectly nice guys, who worked hard and survived a great deal of adversity to get where they are today.  They make a point not to curse on their albums, and seem more than willing to set a good example for the younger fan base that they currently rule over.<br />Still, the fact that Hybrid Theory was the best selling rock album of 2001 is a bad, bad sign for music in general.  Not only does Hybrid Theory offer nothing new in terms of style, melody, or lyrical content, but it also makes the cardinal sin of being unspeakably boring and downright wimpy.  Why?  Well, the best kind of rock (or metal) is usually the empowering kind.  It's a cathartic form of music used to bring you up when you're down.  But Hybrid Theory works in the exact opposite way.  Instead of saying \\"Let's kick some butt,\\" all the songs tend to say, \\"I am getting my butt kicked.\\"  It's a downer to think that all the pain Linkin Park feels has been used to write songs about all the pain they have.  Chester Bennington sure means it when he bellows that \\"these wounds they cannot heal.\\"  But he doesn't seem inclined to do much about it.  It's an emasculating form of rock, with no swagger, no machismo, no you-know-what.  And without that, the music fails.  Guns N' Roses would have these guys for a side dish at breakfast.<br />Also not helping is the MC work of Mike Shinoda.  Like any bad rapper (and the number of those grows exponentially by the second), he raps in the exact same cadence on almost every track.  It's that kind of da-da-DA da-da-DA da-da-da-da-DA cadence that's been beaten to death by the Beastie Boys, Limp Bizkit, and countless others, and its no less dull on this record (Compare Shinoda's raps with those of Eminem, a guy who varies his cadence and delivery with as much creativity as Dr. Seuss).  Rap-rock can work (see Faith No More), but once it falls into a formula, it becomes instantly tiresome.  <br />Hybrid Theory is also overproduced tothe point of bloat.  Synthesized elements bound about on every track (which makes Hybrid Theory's remix album Re-Animation redundant), but they don't add anything new to the songs themselves.  They're just kind of there, and they tend to bury the few good melodies that Linkin Park can muster (see \\"In the End\\").  And after few spins, it becomes obvious that Linkin Park's music is as calculated and inorganic as any assembly line boy band's.  <br />But all is not lost.  Hybrid Theory was such a huge seller, Linkin Park could use the considerable sway they have to get kids into music that's much, well, better than this.  Or one would hope.  All I know is that if this is the future of rock, that's a very dark place indeed.

B000059T1E|5.0|Traffic had one of the most original (and interesting) sounds in British rock, and not only because of their eclectic musical influences, which embraced psychedelia, folk, jazz, soul, R&B, and even classical.  Their unique sound was also the result of their unusual instrumentation.  While the group went through a number of personnel changes, its constant core members were Steve Winwood (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Chris Wood (sax, flute, and organ), and Jim Capaldi (drums & percussion).  With no regular bass player, Winwood often filled in with the bass pedals on his organ.  And, while there is no lack of guitars on most Traffic recordings, the guitar is not emphasized or particularly important to the group's sound.  Dave Mason came and went in their early years and, on other recordings, Steve Winwood would switch to guitar, with Chris Wood taking over organ duties.  In short, Traffic was anything but your typical guitar-bass-drums rock outfit.  And, with \\"white Ray Charles\\" prodigy Winwood at the helm, and with their willingness to experiment with virtually any sound or musical style, they cut some of the most distinctive and important records in British rock.<br />\\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is the only recording by just the Traffic \\"core\\" trio, and it is also one of their strongest.  With Dave Mason only a memory, and the Blind Faith experiment with Eric Clapton over, Steve Winwood returned to the studio to record his first solo album, originally titled \\"Mad Shadows.\\"  Needing a little musical support, he soon enlisted Capaldi and Wood, and Traffic was reborn with \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  However, the radio-friendly 3-minute song structures were abandoned, as Winwood & Co. stretched out into extended jazz-rock compositions.  The instrumental \\"Glad,\\" in particular, with Winwood's unforgetable piano riff and Wood's fat sax, may be the finest jazz-rock composition ever put to vinyl.  In addition, early Traffic's folk-rock was updated by reaching back to medieval Englandfor the title track.  With limited, but extremely talented and complementary, personnel, \\"John Barleycorn\\" is probably Traffic's most cohesive and focused artistic statement.<br />To summarize:  buy this record!
0440217563|3.0|Voyager was an interesting addition to the series begun with Outlander. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite in the same league as Gabaldon's previous novels. To put it bluntly, this book loses some of the &quot;believeability&quot; of the first two books. There are simply too many plot twists that come flying in from left field. This makes much of the book feel strained-- as though Ms. Gabaldon knew she had to come up with SOMETHING for Claire and Jamie, but she wasn't sure what. Still, it was entertaining, and I can't say that I didn't enjoy reading it. I suppose I was just spoiled by the excellence of the first novels in the series.<BR>  One other thing, this is kind of a non-sequiter: I hope the next novel(s) by Diana Gabaldon have a bit less flagellation in them. Someone always seems to be getting hit with a whip, belt or razor strop. Maybe I'm way off here, but the whole punishment-thing seems to show up in all her books. Hmm.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I am basically just reviewing this movie because most reviews are very unfounded. Movies are meant to entertain and make you think. What if time travel was possible? What would I do if it was? I was fascinated by this movie and its special effects, I did not go see it to compare it to the book or analyze it for trite meaningless inaccuracies, I saw it because time travel is a thought-provoking subject, and I wanted to see how the future is presented. Personally I doubt that the Earth will still be in tact as far as this movie goes through time, but it was still interesting to see how humans basically retrograded back to primitive times. I don't over-analyze movies, and none of you should either, it takes away the enjoyment. Spending an entire movie picking it to pieces leaves no time to see what you are watching or to appreciate the work put into it. It is entertainment people, not an editor's desk, leave it be and enjoy the show, I sure did.

With Dave Mason gone and the band temporarily disbanded (while Winwood joined Eric Clapton in Blind Faith), Island Records cobbled this LP together from tracks that didn't make it onto Traffic's earlier albums, along with two extended live jams (&quot;Feelin' Good&quot; and &quot;Blind Man&quot; - neither of which was ever recorded in the studio).  The result, while not as cohesive as Traffic's other releases, is nonetheless exceptionally strong.  While Mason's cut &quot;Just For You&quot; is disposable pop, Winwood's studio tracks are some of his strongest:  the swirling psychedelic soul of &quot;Shanghai Noodle Factory,&quot; the haunting blues-rock of &quot;Withering Tree,&quot; and the Beatlesque rocker &quot;Medicated Goo.&quot;  And, while their sound quality is sub-par, the live tracks on side two are the group's most convincing experiments with the blues, as well as their most essential concert recordings available.<br />In short, &quot;Last Exit&quot; isn't Traffic's best album, but it's not far behind.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is a wonderfully well written and thoughtful book from beginning to end.  It is about how the murder of a 14 year old girl named Susie Salmon changes the lives of her family and friends.  This book has an interesting premise that people in heaven still long for things on earth.  Each character is affected by her death greatly.  Susie watches the lives of the people she loves from heaven.  She watches her friends and siblings grow up.  I loved reading about the romantic relationship between Susie's younger sister Lindsay and her boyfriend Samuel.  I love the psychic connection Susie has with her friend  Ruth Connors.  Susie's spirit inhabits Ruth's body in one of the most touching parts of the book.  Susie's parents respond to their daughter's death in very different ways.  This causes them to drift apart.  Susie's mother strays away physically and emotionally from her family for several years to forget the pain of her loss.  Susie's father organizes memorials to remember his daughter every year on the anniversary of her death.  However, he is unable to part with his Susie's clothes several years after her death.  It is interesting to read how their marriage breaks apart and mends itself back together.  Every character including Susie up in heaven learns to accept her death and move on.  This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Progression. Development. Whatever, call it what you like, this is the Wilco album we have been waiting for. Look at Wilco's (prolific) progress so far:<BR>1. AM - The Uncle Tupelo album Jeff Tweedy always wanted to make, without Jay Farrar's po-faced sincerity lurking in the background.<BR>2. Being There - a wonderful, sprawling journey of discovery through Americana. Watch out for tracks like &quot;Why would you wanna live&quot;, &quot;Misunderstood&quot; and &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; to give us a faint clue what's coming soon.<BR>3. Mermaid Avenue - A collaboration with Billy Bragg, but not a happy one. Tweedy likes to be his own boss and tensions emerge during the project. There was a great documentary screened on BBC called &quot;Man in the Sand&quot; which uncovered this. A very special project, still.<BR>4. Summerteeth - The end of Wilco as an alt.country proposition. Seriously funky tunes (I can't stand it, Nothingsevergoingtostandinmyway) , seriously dark lyrics (Via Chicago, She's a Jar) and seriously serious arrangements (Pieholden Suite) point the way. They probably shipped a few fans at this stage, but gained a hell of a lot more.<br />Which brings us to where we are today (thank you, editor, if you let my long-winded introduction get this far).<br />I needn't go into the minutae of the album itself, as many previous reviewers have already done so. The album rewards frequent listening, as it has so many little nuances and textures you may have missed before. Think Pet Sounds. Yes, it's that good. In years to come, people will discuss this album in the same hushed, reverential tones as Brian Wilson's finest hour.<br />Ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Tweedy is a genius. Cherish him.
B000002WYT|5.0|This is yet another Dave Matthews Band studio masterpiece. Let me get to the review.<br />So Much To Say- A monumental recording that you are sure to love.<br />Two Step- A monumental recording that you are sure to love.<br />Crash Into Me- A monumental recording that you are sure to love.<br />Too Much- A great song and a very fun one at that. Talking about peoples greed and their inability to take care of themselves in a health sense. There are some other elements that you will hear too.<br />#41- A monumental recording that you are sure to love. Great violin solo by Boyd Tinsley, Great sax solo by Leroi Moore.<br />Say Goodbye- A beautiful love song...will maybe there's some lust. The song is basically about that yearning that people who are friends expiriance when suddenly one of them finds the other irresistable[most likely this would be the man wanting the woman...I mean who are we kidding.]<br />Drive In Drive Out- A monumental recording that you are sure to love if you don't mind the anger in it.<br />Let You Down- A beautiful song about asking for forgiveness from a lover that you have done wrong.<br />Lie In Our Graves- A monumental recording that you are sure to love.<br />Cry Freedom- A monumental recording that you are sure to love as long as its sad elements don't bring you down to much...you see its about the apartheid in South Africa.<br />Tripping Billies- A monumental recording that you are sure to love.<br />Proudest Monkey- A superb and very funny song with some serious elements to it. Very relaxing too. <br />Another thing too, Dave Matthews Lyrics are poetic and wonderful through out the entire album.<br />Hope you buy this album. It is a masterpiece. And if you are a DMB fan reading this What's Up! Love is all we need EVERYDAY!

B000067CPX|5.0|I have been listening to theis cd over and over ever since I got it the day it came out. I loved the single By The Way, (even though it sounded kinda poor at first listen) and heard most of the songs as they were released one by one each day to the local radio station. I thought that they were alright, but nothing special. That was until I bought the album, and listened to it more than once. The first listen had me feeling like this new effort by the Peppers was Californication part 2. I was wrong, this cd is WAY BETTER than californication, and any other RHCP album. The songs are amazing. I began to give the album some more listens, to give it more of a try. I am glad I did. This cd is just amazing. Each song is beautiful in its own way. The song structure in each song almost puts me in a trance and keeps me floating the whole way through the album. It is great that there are so many songs also! You really get your money's worth when you purchase this cd. Possibly one of the best cd's of 2002. If you are considering buying this album, I really recommend it. Give it a couple listens and you will be addicted. A must buy!!!
B0000024RQ|5.0|I keep coming back to this album and keep finding new and pertinent feelings and ideas. I agree with the previous reviewer (July 4)in that the songs feel as if they were written by an older person. Bob must have been in his early twenties however the intensity in the lyrics seem to come from deeper experience. I recently learned many of the experiences expresed on his song Bob Dylan's Dream ( track #  8)about how friendships evolve and disolve.<br />Also a very playful streak in many of the songs reveal another side of his personality.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I Absolutely love this movie!!!!!!!!! It is my favorite movie. The DVD is great, good behind the scenes footage. Of course I wish there were more. I just wanted to come on and say my opinion. I always read the reviews for this movie and a lot of people put it down, but I love it. It is such a fun movie, people take it too seriously. I know some things in the movie are silly, but I like it. I love it when they have those tough women kicking butt. She is so strong and has a great attitude about things. She always looks like she`s having fun even in a tough situation or even when she`s not. One of my favorite scenes is the opening sequence. I love the part where she reloads her guns and then I love when she flips onto that column and it makes a little flip noise. (If you`ve seen the movie you know what I`m talking about.) It is a great movie And I Highly Recommend It! Can`t wait for the sequel!!

And, with &quot;white Ray Charles&quot; prodigy Winwood at the helm, and with their willingness to experiment with virtually any sound or musical style, they cut some of the most distinctive and important records in British rock.<br />Their first (and best) full-length live album, &quot;Welcome to the Canteen&quot; is an interesting historical timepiece.  Dave Mason had left the band, but rejoined his old mates for this appearance, contributing two of the strongest cuts from his 1970 solo masterpiece &quot;Alone Together&quot; (&quot;Sad &amp; Deep as You&quot; and &quot;Shouldn't Have Took More Than You Gave&quot;).  Winwood is also well represented with excellent live versions of &quot;40,000 Headmen&quot; and &quot;Medicated Goo.&quot;  Unfortunately, extended live jams were just coming into vogue, and side two is taken up by unnecessarily long versions of &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy&quot; and Winwood's Spencer Davis Group classic &quot;Gimme Some Lovin',&quot; which are really only valuable to Traffic completists.<br/>Altogether, not an essential Traffic release, but not bad either.
B000001DTM|5.0|&quot;Actung Baby&quot; is the album that would confirm U2's status as the greatest rock and roll band of our generation.  It's a mind-blowing collection of soul-searching songs that excel on every front.  &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; may be a popular favorite among most fans, but &quot;Actung Baby&quot; is the CD that had Bono, Edge, Mullen, and Clayton at their artistic peak.  &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot; is a groovy mix of funky guitars and drum beats that flirt with hip hop, &quot;Zoo Station&quot; is an abrasive rocker with Bono's voice electronically distorted; it's the closest to industrial dance the group has ever come.  &quot;The End of the World&quot; and &quot;The Fly&quot; are classic U2 gems that stand out on the strength of the Edge's amazing guitar, and the ballad &quot;One&quot; was a well-deserved hit that cracked the Top Ten.  This is the most musically rich album these guys released.  I played for the first time in so many years, and it still sounds as vital as it did in 1991.  U2 are one of the most enduring rock bands around, and this excellent record explains why.
B000063S6Z|4.0|Where &quot;Play&quot; was innovative, &quot;18&quot; is subtle.  Proof of this is the song &quot;Great Escape,&quot; a beautifully crafted song that shows what Moby can do with nothing more than remarkable vocals laid down by Azure Ray.  His songs start out with a amazing vocals, then he adds a piano, guitar or whatever.  After this he adds a beat, then some warm strings and then ends with vocal only.  He has this down to a science, and it works.
B000002HHB|5.0|Aunque no soy fan de ella, ni de 10.000 Maniacs (me gustan cosas sueltas), este disco es absolutamente una delicia, de principio a fin. Cuantas ms veces lo escuchas, ms te gusta. Canciones como &quot;I May know the world&quot; -con sus ocho minutos-, &quot;Beloved Wife&quot;, o en general todo el disco, son un conjunto encantador. Para tener en el top ten de nuestra discoteca.
B00001R3GI|5.0|The Rolling Stones are one of the most important rock bands ever, and the 1971-72 period (covering &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;) was their musical peak.  Together, these two albums represent the very best of British blues-rock.  Essential listening.
B000050XEI|5.0|What a joy it is to break away from pop princesses, Britney Spears wannabes, head banging trash, and boring old love cliches and find peace in the beautiful world Enya creates. When I first heard \\"Only Time\\", I didn't think too much of it. But soon enough, I couldn't get the song out of my head and I found myself waiting for the next time I would hear it. Then I heard \\"Wild Child\\" and I knew that I had to get the album. \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is currently the only Enya album I own, but I hope to be getting some of her older stuff soon. This album will leave your mind in a state of peace and tranquility from the first note of \\"A Day Without Rain\\" to the last sound of \\"Lazy Days\\". \\"Wild Child\\" is my absolute FAVORITE song on the album and possibly in the whole world. The rest of the highlights include \\"Only Time\\", \\"Deora Ar Mo Chori\\", \\"Fallen Embers\\", \\"Pilgrim\\" and \\"One By One\\". Enya's beautiful crystaline voice shines in every one of her angelic songs. Her style his very unique and I've never heard anything like it. \\"A Day Without Rain\\" is a great album to listen too when you feel troubled or uneasy. I hope this review helped. Thank you and have a nice day.
B00005YXZH|3.0|While this album is completely void of their country influences, it comes across as an album that was put together with little care.  There are some songs on here that save it from getting two stars.  &quot;Jesus etc,&quot; is probably my favorite, followed by &quot;War on War,&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer.&quot;  But other than these songs, I find that the album doesn't hold together very well.
6305882592|5.0|Harold and Maude is the kind of movie that keeps your mind going back to it after the film is over. It's kind of Zen like! KIND OF! One of the scenes was filmed near my house (going on the Dumbarton Bridge In Newark,California. The way it looked back in 1971)
B000000IV3|3.0|\\"Shoot Out at the Fantasy Factory\\" could have easily been called \\"Low Spark Volume 2.\\"  Steve Winwood's immense talents are again wasted on jazz-fusion noodling.  \\"Evening Blue\\" is a nice folk-rock number, and the album as a whole has more of a rock edge than the easy-listening \\"Low Spark,\\" but Traffic is still clearly running out of steam.  To make matters worse, the album closes with \\"Uninspired,\\" a cliched keep-a-stiff-upper-lip anthem with lyrics that read like a hippie's Hallmark card, and (very unusual for a Winwood recording) musical accompaniment that takes a back seat to the words.  Come to think of it, that song could have provided the title for the entire album.
B00004Z459|4.0|Before I start my review I would like to clear some things up. 1) Linkin Park was NOT put together like boy-bands. Do some research for crying out loud!!! 2) Copying \\"Fred Durst's\\" scream/sing? It ain't nothing new, but no way did they steal it from Durst. Try \\"Led Zeppelin\\". 3) All about guys with bad girlfirends? That's your mindset, not the music. Take a look at the lyrics. Sure, songs like \\"In The End\\" are about bad relationships, but the majority of the songs are about the emotion. \\"One Step Closer\\" for example, isn't necessarily about a bad relationship.<BR>Now on with the review...<BR>Tale some rock, mix it with rap. Then add techno, and add a dash of pop (just a dash) and you have Linkin Park. It's been done before, but it seems every other band doing it uses the \\"F\\" word every 10 seconds. Linkin Park gets the message through without a single swear (I'm serious, look at the lyrics!). As a member of the band once said, \\"We try to go between the letters of f---.\\"<br />Here's a quick rating of each track:<BR>1. \\"Papercut\\" - A good solid opening track, but it gets old fast. 7/10<BR>2. \\"One Step Closer\\" - A little to hard for me, but it's pretty thereputic when I'm in a bad mood. 6/10<BR>3. \\"With You\\" - This is where the good stuff really starts. 8/10<BR>4. \\"Points Of Autority\\" - Doesn't have as much emotion as some of the other songs, but still a personal facorite. 8/10<BR>5. \\"Crawling\\" - Everyone knows this one. It's really a great song, but the radio killed it. 9/10<BR>6. \\"Runaway\\" - Not one of the best tracks on the album, but stilla great one. 8/10<BR>7. \\"By Myself\\" - It took me awhile to warm up to this one. 6/10<BR>8. \\"In The End\\" - Probably one of Linkin Park's best. The radio nearly brought it down, but it didn't kill it. 10/10<BR>9. \\"A Place for My Head\\" - Mike Shinoda really shows his skills here! Add a catchy chorus and you get 8/10<BR>10. \\"Forgotten\\" - Here's another one that took me awhile to warm up to, but unlike \\"By Myself\\" it hit hard. 10/10<BR>11. \\"Cure for the Itch\\" - The only happy-ish song on the album. It's a great addition, but it gets old fast. 7/10<BR>12. \\"Pushing Me Away\\" - A good ending track. Not incredibly different from \\"Runaway\\" but still good. 8/10<br />All in all, it's a great album. Nothing out standing, but really good.<BR>And to all those who hate those who hate it: Hey, it's different. Everyone's got opinions. People have every right to hate it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Dylan amazes me every day that I am alive.  What lyrics, what melodies, what songs!  Every song on this album is unforgettable.  Just listen to &quot;Floater&quot; and the violin used in that song, amazing!  &quot;Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum&quot; is very similar to &quot;Times Have Changed&quot; from the Wonder Boys soundtrack.  He again sings &quot;Mississippi&quot; and does a cover of the bluegrass romp, &quot;Highwater.&quot;  What else can I say about this album?  A clear masterpiece that measures up to his finest.
0441003257|5.0|There is no more to say.  If you're going to buy one book this year and read only one book from now until the time you die, this book should be it.  If you don't feel like you're going to crack a rib because you're laughing so hard while reading this book then you have No sense of humour!!
B000059T1G|5.0|Traffic had one of the most original (and interesting) sounds in British rock, and not only because of their eclectic musical influences, which embraced psychedelia, folk, jazz, soul, R&amp;B, and even classical.  Their unique sound was also the result of their unusual instrumentation.  While the group went through a number of personnel changes, its constant core members were Steve Winwood (vocals, keyboards, guitars), Chris Wood (sax, flute, and organ), and Jim Capaldi (drums &amp; percussion).  With no regular bass player, Winwood often filled in with the bass pedals on his organ.  And, while there is no lack of guitars on most Traffic recordings, the guitar is not emphasized or particularly important to the group's sound.  Dave Mason came and went in their early years and, on other recordings, Steve Winwood would switch to guitar, with Chris Wood taking over organ duties.  In short, Traffic was anything but your typical guitar-bass-drums rock outfit.  And, with &quot;white Ray Charles&quot; prodigy Winwood at the helm, and with their willingness to experiment with virtually any sound or musical style, they cut some of the most distinctive and important records in British rock.<br />&quot;Last Exit,&quot; their third full-length release, is actually a record-company creation.  With Dave Mason gone and the band temporarily disbanded (while Winwood joined Eric Clapton in Blind Faith), Island Records cobbled this LP together from tracks that didn't make it onto Traffic's earlier albums, along with two extended live jams (&quot;Feelin' Good&quot; and &quot;Blind Man&quot; - neither of which was ever recorded in the studio).  The result, while not as cohesive as Traffic's other releases, is nonetheless exceptionally strong.  While Mason's cut &quot;Just For You&quot; is disposable pop, Winwood's studio tracks are some of his strongest:  the swirling psychedelic soul of &quot;Shanghai Noodle Factory,&quot; the haunting blues-rock of &quot;Withering Tree,&quot; and the Beatlesque rocker &quot;Medicated Goo.&quot;  And, while their sound quality is sub-par, the live tracks on side two are the group's most convincing experiments with the blues, as well as their most essential concert recordings available.<br />In short, &quot;Last Exit&quot; isn't Traffic's best album, but it's not far behind.
0312265859|2.0|I wanted to like this latest Stephanie Plum adventure, but I couldn't.  Lots of things happen, but they don't seem to happen for a reason, and in this outing, unlike previous books, Stephanie never figures ANYTHING out herself.  Stuff happens to her, but it seems to come out of the blue, and has nothing to do with the plot that just isn't there.  Even the funniest moment in the book, when her mother runs over the \\"rabbit\\", has little to do with Stephanie and more to do with trying to manufacture some excitement/suspense.  As others have noted, the same old car-blowing-up, losing-keys/handcuffs/purse, Grandma Mazur antics, are losing steam, and don't hold up without a plot to carry them.  Stephanie didn't accomplish a thing this time: she didn't find Evelyn, but Ranger told her where Evelyn was, Ranger also told her what Abruzzi was after, her mom saved her from the rabbit, and her sister saved her from torture.  Even in One for the Money, Stephanie, as a complete novice, figured out most of what was going on and managed to bring Morelli in.  Now, with lots of cases under her belt, she should be doing better than this.  I was left with a hollow feeling, kind of like when your jelly donut doesn't have any jelly in it.  I'll probably buy number nine, but maybe in paperback.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is great!  LInkin park brings a fresh new sound to the music world.  Totally awesome!
B000002JS6|5.0|All I can say is that Back in Black is truely one of the best AC/DC albums I have ever encountered. Face it. I used to get really annoyed by AC/DC (Admittedly Brian Johnson does not have the best voice), but this album changed that. It all started with  \\"Hell's Bells,\\" one of the most powerful songs I have ever heard. I Don't know what it is exactly, but that song has the guitar power to really grip your soul! It was addicting. In my opinion, the first song is the highlite, but it is full of others that are definately worthy of your listening. The catchy \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", the liveliness of \\"What do You do for Money, Honey\\" and \\"Have a Drink on Me\\", the smooth lust of \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\", the dirty but hilarious \\"Shake a Leg\\" and \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\", the classic self-title \\"Back in Black\\", and their not-over-yet legacy of \\"Rock 'n' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" are all great songs. Then there is the popish action of \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", which is the only one on the album that I wasn't all that fond of. But hey, on the bright side, it is rated as the  #1 AC/DC song these days. But yes, this is definately an album that you shouldn't miss!!!
B00000592F|5.0|Procol Harum dropped off the musical radar screen after 1970, but &quot;Exotic Birds &amp; Fruit&quot; is actually one of their strongest recordings.  &quot;As Strong As Samson,&quot; in particular, is one of the most beautiful rock songs I have ever heard, with a haunting organ riff that easily rivals &quot;Whiter Shade of Pale.&quot;  It is, in short, Procol's last masterpiece.
B00005JKJA|2.0|First of all, I write this as a fan of David Lynch movies. Please disregard all those &quot;top reviewers&quot; who have nothing better to do than write reviews on this web site. And disregard all those people who say you have to be smart or open-minded to understand this movie. Bottom line: this movie makes absolutely no sense. Even after the supposed &quot;explanation&quot; for this movie - sorry Mr Lynch - it still makes no sense, and it is just an exercise in frustration to try and figure it out. Anyone who says they understand this movie just wants to be part of the crowd. <br />This movie has great cinematography and some excellent dramatic scenes; one of my favorites being the scene in the theatre toward the end. The acting is superb. Sounds like a formula for a great movie but unfortunately its a convoluted mess with an even more convoluted ending. <br />Unless you are a big fan of David Lynch avoid this film. For the average movie-goer it just won't be worth it.
B000002JS8|5.0|Once I heard a DJ on a radio station say that the song \\"Highway to Hell\\" would never die. I cannot agree with him more. This is the only song I know of that hit the charts at #1 for AC/DC, and it is well deserving of it. The energy and movement of the song is great; a real Bon Scott classic. Yet this is not the only song that makes this album well worth listening to. The first time I heard \\"Girl's Got Rhythm,\\" I was hooked. The beat and guitar make it such a fun song that one could even dance to it! The even rhythm of \\"Touch too Much\\", the quickness and energy of \\"Beating Around the Bush\\", the hilarity and irony in \\"Shot Down in Flames\\", the catchy \\"If You Want Blood, (You Got It),\\" and the sinister power of the notorious \\"Night Prowler\\" (even though it did have its influence on a serial killer) are all awesome songs in my opinion. This is one album that no true AC/DC fan should even think of missing out on!

B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is a very unique band to my mind. They are often listed as alternative, but they seem to have a genre all their own. They don't just stick with one pattern in their music-it goes all over the place. This album is a prime example. The music goes anywhere from soft and sad or energetic and happy to harsh and angry. All the songs are emotional, with one to fit any mood you may have. \\"Stinkfist\\" is an active song, a mix of different styles and is somewhat surprising, often building to a climax before settling down again. \\"Eulogy\\" is one of their masterpieces, made of a long, soothing intro that leads into Maynard's awesome singing. \\"H\\" is almost indescribable to my mind. It is so powerful and emotionally potent. Starting out with heavy guitar and then becoming light and delicate, it is enough to make one cry. It can be made to mean many different things, but I'm sure it describes a relationship most of us have at some point in our lives. \\"46&2\\" is more of a searching song with soothing guitar that relaxes the mind (I find that a lot of Tool songs are even good to go to sleep to, though this by no means says that they are boring!). \\"Hooker with a Penis\\" puts sort of a different twist on things. Its angry, more threatening style is great if you need to get out some aggression after a bad time.  The title track of this album is another more aggressive song with wild music that settles down at first before Maynard hits the chorus harshly at full force. Overall, this is my favorite Tool album, full of surprises and mixed emotion. One thing I really enjoy about it is that all the songs are ambiguous, with Maynard leaving the listener to decide his or her own interpretation of the song. Uniquely enough, he also leaves slight intervals in between some of the songs (such as \\"Useful Idiot\\"), seemingly to prepare us for the next one or give us a slight break. In my mind, this is an album that no true Tool fan would go without!

B00003CXPJ|4.0|I loved the inventiveness of this movie.  On one level, it's superficial fluff.  On another level, there are sly little parodies of Rocky, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Coal Miner's Daughter, The Manchurian Candidate, Fight Club, and others I probably missed.<br />Worth it solely to see Will Ferrell, hysterical as designer Mugatu, saying &quot;That Hansel, he's really hot right now&quot; every time Owen Wilson crosses his path.

With Dave Mason only a memory, and the Blind Faith experiment with Eric Clapton over, Steve Winwood returned to the studio to record his first solo album, originally titled \\"Mad Shadows.\\"  Needing a little musical support, he soon enlisted Capaldi and Wood, and Traffic was reborn with \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  However, the radio-friendly 3-minute song structures were abandoned, as Winwood & Co. stretched out into extended jazz-rock compositions.  The instrumental \\"Glad,\\" in particular, with Winwood's unforgetable piano riff and Wood's fat sax, may be the finest jazz-rock composition ever put to vinyl.  In addition, early Traffic's folk-rock was updated by reaching back to medieval Englandfor the title track.  With limited, but extremely talented and complementary, personnel, \\"John Barleycorn\\" is probably Traffic's most cohesive and focused artistic statement.<br />To summarize:  buy this record!
B00003CXB7|2.0|This movie aged faster than a fruit fly. Poorly filmed (it looks grainy in parts), strained humor, Altman's usual messy direction (or is it his non-direction?), all conspire to create a film that was topical for about a month and then corny, and then over-the-hill. The tv series is funnier.

And, with \\"white Ray Charles\\" prodigy Winwood at the helm, and with their willingness to experiment with virtually any sound or musical style, they cut some of the most distinctive and important records in British rock.<br />\\"Mr. Fantasy\\" was their full-length debut, and (as it was 1967) their most psychedelic release.  (Linda Eastman-McCartney once recounted the story of visiting the group at their Berkshire cottage and playing the Beatles' new \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" LP for them to hear, upon which Winwood & Co. were reportedly dismayed that the Beatles had already used many of their ideas for \\"Mr. Fantasy.\\")  While the album has many similarities with \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" (vaudville brass, '60s silliness, not to mention drug influences), it is by no means an imitator of the Beatles' masterpiece.  \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" is darker (\\"Dealer\\" and \\"No Face...\\") and more blues-oriented (especially the title track).  If anything, it is a successful (though not demonic) version of what the Stones tried and failed to do with their laughable \\"Satanic Majesty's Request.\\"<br />The obvious weakness of this album is the songwriting contributions of Dave Mason.  While Mason would soon perfect his George Harrison-style British folk-rock, his work on \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" (\\"House for Everyone,\\" \\"Utterly Simple,\\" etc.) simply sounds like that of a [poor] Beatle-wannabe.  In 1967, United Artists remedied this problem by replacing a few of his songs with Traffic's early non-LP singles for the American version of the album.<br />There were, therefore, orginally two different versions of \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" (as was the case with most early Beatle LPs).  However, most recent CD reissues of the album include all the tracks from both versions (a quick tip:  if \\"Paper Sun\\" is on the CD, you've got all the tracks) - so with some creative use of your CD programmer, you can listen to either version - or both.<br />And listen you should, because \\"Mr. Fantasy\\" is an underappreciated classic.
6304938241|4.0|Adapted from Henry James' book and pushed forward into the 20th century, this is one of those rare period dramas that lulls you into thinking that you know what's coming and then pulls the rug from under you.  The story has Kate (Bonham Carter) carrying out a love affair with Merton (Roache), although her aunt and benefactor thinks that marrying him would be below her.  So it's a case of what does Kate want more - love or money?  Pursued by sleazy Lord Mark she uses her friendship with millionaire Millie to fly off to Venice.  And it's here that the plot takes a turn that few will see coming, as Kate's plots to have the best of both worlds become gradually darker as she forces Merton and Millie together.<br />What stays with you though is the bleakness of the movie, as Kate's corrupt plans corrupt any hope of future happiness, and it's a brave film that offers up a dark ending with no redemption in sight.  The performances from all concerned are so perfectly judged that it will, in its last half, destroy your faith in basic human goodness and the truth in love.  Bonham Carter and Roache are particularly impressive, playing the conflict between wanting to do what's right and doing what benefits them astutely.  Moreover, there's a sex scene that is completely necessary to the story, tasteful and beautifully full of desperation, due in no small part to the acting.  Surely there are few movies out there that can say that.<br />In a lot of ways this reminded me of the later `House Of Mirth', so if intelligent period dramas are what you like then this is a fine example.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|As you know, this version is from the first under our suspicious eyes -- remake of George Pal classic?  (I can hear some of you say \\"No more remakes!\\")  Or, who's the director Simon Wells -- H.G. Well's great-grandson?  (So what?)  Well, this is not exactly a remake of that 1960 version, and Mr. Simon has actually directed films in the past (see \\"Balto\\"), so he is no newcomer who doesn't know anything about moviemaking.  And  before you criticize this entertaining version of \\"Time Machine,\\" you should remember one thing, and this is it.<br />Many complaints are based on our preoccupied idea about Time Machine and its concept.  You expect some genuine Sci-Fi story like Tom Cruise's \\"Minority Report.\\"  Wrong.  \\"Time Machine\\" of 2002 sticks fairly closely to the original novella written by H. G. Wells, and if you have read that, the filmmaker's intention is clearer.  There's a lot of cool gadgets (especially the time machine design and its time travel seqences), but the original story had another agenda which the film tries to preserve, and I will explain later below.<br />The story of the film, to be honest, is pretty weak.  It follows a scientst living in New York, 1899 (Guy Pearce), who is to invent a time machine to change the past.  For he is to lose his finacee, so he decides to go back before she is dead, and tries to change her fate.  But he fails, and despair makes him time-travel further, this time to the future, to find the reason.  He goes on and on, finally arrives at the future 800,000 years later from his original time.  <br />So far, all right, though somewhat the story is far-fetched.  But now the trouble follows unless you're prepared for the drastic turn of the story.  For many audience will witness the future looks like ... the past!  Actually, humans are living in coarsely made houses, wearing \\"Flintstone\\"-like clothes.  Night is pitch dark, no books, no TVs, nothing.  In fact, I heard one of the audience sitting in the theater say, \\"It's like an episode from \\"Indiana Jones,\\" as if being perplexed, or cheated.  <br />This is what happens if you expect here another P. K. Dick world.  You might feel like being served a wrong dish you didn't order in a restaurant.  But the original book goes exactly like this as this film shows, and Time Traveller is to see wicked Morlocks killing meek Eois, and that bleak world is usually thought to be H. G. Well's satire of the comtemporary English class system.  The film justly observes that point, but whether it is exactly what the audience of the 21st century wanted is another matter.  Considering the number of negative reviews, they didn't.<br />So, keep these things in mind, and aceept the film as it is, discarding your own images about time machines.  The CGI techniques are all first-rate, serving as joyful eye-candy, and special make-ups of Morlocks are astonishing, courtesy of Stan Winston Studio.  Pearce is reliable, which we all know (and I know because I saw \\"Memento\\"), and an unexpected find is Irish singer Samantha Mumba as Mara (her brother Kalen is played by Samantha's real brother Omero, who is also good).  It's a bit pity that Mark Addy and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson and Sophie Thompson's mother) are given small roles, and as to Jeremy Irons, ... er ... officially I announce, he is now a character actor, playing evil mastermind Uber-Morlock. <br />Not a perfect film, I admit, but \\"Time Machine\\" might become a better film if you just change the way you look at it.  It's not about the theory of time travel (if you want that, see \\"Back to the Future\\"); it's not about thrilling future world (in that case, \\"Blade Runner\\").  It is an attempt to make a new and faithful adaptation of H. G. Wells classic, but perhaps should not have to be so faithful as that.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This album is the worst made by Shakira. It is great but the past ones were better.

B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives, along with The Strokes and The White Stripes, are being considered rocks revival in a time when rap and pop are dominating the charts. If you are expecting a masterpiece that will change the world of music, you will be sorely disappointed. If you simply want catchy riffs and songs you can jam to, you'll enjoy this album.  'Die, Alright', 'Main Offender', 'Hate To Say I Told You So', and 'Supply and Demand' highlight this 28 minute CD. That may seem short, but 28 minutes is enough time for them to get their point across. By the time you finish track 12, you feel exhausted. It's heavy, loud, catchy, and most of all, fun. Nothing more, nothing less. Enjoy.
6305428387|5.0|This is a great movie. It is good clean fun. The whole family can watch and laugh. I got my mom to watch it and she hardly watchs movies and she loved it. She thought it was funny. This is a good movie about team work and getting along with your team mates. I hope you enjoy this movie. John Candy is good in this movie.
B00005YW4H|3.0|If compared to other women her age who are topping the music charts, then Nora Jones is certainly a gem and deserving of all the praise she's receiving. It seems though that these accolades come from tired ears yearning for something innovative and unique. Jones's voice is certainly smooth and lovely and sweet on the ears; there is no doubt that this is a raw talent and with a voice of her own. Her intelligent energy infuses each track; all of this shines when the songs are the most simple and truthful. But while this CD is fine for what it is, I wasn't blown away. Instead I found the music kind of bland, the lyrics trite and my ears nearly bled from boredom.  The most enjoyable aspect of this CD is that it is a lovely glimmer of what could potentially come from Jones. For now, \\"Come Away With Me\\" is nice to throw on for a mellow dinner, or when you have less adventurous guests who think they like jazz.
0385335482|4.0|This was a great book.  I just couldn't stop laughing and could really relate to some of the reasons why Becky should have new shoes, outfit, purse etc!!  This is a great quick read!!!
B00000JMQE|5.0|One of the coolest movies I've ever seen. It was really unique, just like The Labyrinth. It was pretty 'artsy'. I mean that it was totally abstract and original. It's better suited for viewers that are older than 7 because any younger and they might get frightened due to the unfluffy atmosphere of the movie. It's really good and I suggest it for anyone.
0793927501|5.0|As character portraits go, this movie is a tour de force.  The plot may be predictable,  but the character drawn by Anthony Hopkins is masterful.  A likeable, if self-effacing, intellectual in the beginning of the movie, Hopkins finds himself and learns that his true riches reside within himself.  We see his bravado grow into genuine confidence as he comes to recognize that his resourcefulness really is unique.  Shedding unnecessary layers of his life along the way, Hopkins walks out of the wilderness of Alaska and the wilderness of his self.  He emerges as a transformed version of himself, having added wisdom to knowledge and courage to assurance while retaining the basic decency that characterized him from the beginning.<br />Alex Baldwin's portrait of Robert, the photographer, is equally competent.  It is not possible to admire his character, but one must applaud his portrayal.<br />The supporting roles are at least adequate, and in some cases, more than adequate, but the real standouts are Hopkins, Baldwin, and the wonderful wilderness scenery.<br />This review would not be complete without naming a favorite scene in the film:  near the end, Hopkins disembarks from the rescue helicopter and receives recognition and acknowledgement from two backwoodmen in the form of a subtle nod.  Very nice!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|I remember when I was about 16 I was reading the Time Machine in High School and saw the movie around the same time as reading the book and loved both. The original wasn't actually the book but it's much more accurate than this Simon Wells remake. It added too much and even changed the names of the main characters. Instead the Time Machine being made in the sake of science, Alexandra (Guy Pearce) creates the Time Machine to try and stop his girlfriend from being killed. Instead of the Eloys being pretty small like in the book or being a bunch of blondes like in the original movie they are all natives with their own language. They know they're in danger and pretty much know they're cattle to the Morlocks in this version as well. Plus there's a leader to the Morlocks played by Jeromy Irons in this version and he looks more like Mr. Freeze.<br /> For being related to H.G. Wells who wrote the book, Simon Wells the director butchered up the story a lot. Still I must say I enjoyed the movie, it's still a fun popcorn movie. The visuals are good, as are the action and the performance by Guy Pearce...The oscar winning special effects are a bit dated and the Morlocks are obviously just people jumping around in make-up and suits. Still it is one of my favorite science fiction films of all time. I guess since this one is a little different, that is what's fun about it though . Mostly since you don't know what to expect from it.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is yet another example of how bland movies have become. Not only is the film funny and engaging; it is also gorgeous, an artistic masterpiece. The use of contrast and color, the filming and camera use, and of course the digital filming to bring it all out...it shows just how much dullness and monotony fester in Hollywood. The acting was excellent, especially Audrey Tautou's charming performance. The movie was great in so many ways, especially since I am a French student.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil movie dident follow the games story line i hope the next one is better but all i saw in the movie was some zombies, zombie dogs, and a licker i dident see the hunter,tyrant, or nemisis and thay dident talk about the games story or how the t-virus started but thats why i rated this movie a 4 star..!

It is the type of cd that you can relate to pretty much all of the songs.The album is a true masterpiece i couldnt have been more pleased. I listened to the whole thing through and didnt feel tempted to skip a track or anything. I highly recommend this cd to anyone. It has a good charlotte-blink vibe going on so if you like them then you will love this. and even if you dont... i like everytype of music my favorite band is nsync and i love this cd..its not too..anything its just perfect.

B00005YW4H|2.0|The industry is hungering for a beautiful, young icon to take up the torch (literally) of the old classic styles.  Unfortunately, this hunger blinds them to the mediocrity of this particular release.  A couple of the tracks are quite pleasant but otherwise the music is boring (think Yanni.)  I saw her live and her stage presence was limp at best.   One of the reviewers here wrote \\"This girl is HOT!!!\\"  If she weren't 22 and beautiful, would anyone be listening? Oh well, maybe I'm just jaded. Certainly there are a lot of popular singers out there with worse voices!

B000002MIY|5.0|Donald Fagen's 2nd solo album, 1993's \\"Kamakiriad,\\" came darn close to being released as a Steely Dan album---Fagen's old Dan co-hort, Walter Becker, produced the album, plays guitar on it, and co-wrote the song \\"Snowbound,\\" t'boot. But since Fagen practically wrote everything else for the album on his own, \\"Kamakiriad\\" was ultimately released as a Donald Fagen solo album (and the official return of Steely Dan would have to wait until 2000's \\"Two Against Nature\\"). But no matter---this \\"almost Steely Dan\\" album is simply terrific, filled with all of the high trademark qualities you'd expect in the music of a Dan man. It's a cool mixture of cocktail jazz/pop, featuring Fagen's hip vocals, cookin' guitars, fat drums, smooth keyboards, happenin' horns, and, for the cherry on top, great sound & production that's very crisp. Not only that, but \\"Kamakiriad\\" is a cool *concept* album, telling the story of an Everyman living sometime in the future, who takes off for a spin in his technological wonder car of the 21st century, the Kamakiri, and has several adventures along the way. Being a single album rather than a double, the storyline for \\"Kamakiriad\\" may be a lot thinner than, say, The Who's \\"Tommy\\" or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall,\\" but I don't think Fagen was trying to compete with these double-album rock epics, and the story he tells here is nice & simple, to the point, and a lot of fun, just like the songs themselves.So, hop in the car, hit the \\"Trans-Island Skyway,\\" admire the \\"Countermoon,\\" take your pick of \\"Tomorrow's Girls,\\" chill out \\"On The Dunes,\\" and head out to that \\"Teahouse On The Tracks.\\" Donald Fagen's \\"Kamakiriad\\" is a wonderful ride. :-)
B00005R2M3|5.0|This album shows the world just how great Shakira is I have Known she would be the world biggest star snice i frist heard her music in 1996. Any one who loves Whenever Wherever, Underneath Your Clothes and Objection anh Has not Heard any of the other songs. Has to get Laundry Service all the song are great this album is a master piece but then again so is everthing Shakira.
B00000GJ2B|5.0|Scorsese has probably created the greatest motion picture of the last thirty years in Raging Bull. I've seen it roughly half a dozen times and with each viewing it seems to engross me more than the last.<br /><br />Based on LaMotta's biography ( a fantastic book), Raging Bull is as real and authentic as a film can possibly get. The finest scenes are not necessarily the fight sequences, but rather the script and dialogue between the brothers (Jake's brother is played by Joe Pesci in a first rate performance) are as realistic as I've yet to come across. Moreover the scenes of the classy old New York City nightclub world are simply astounding. They'll make you long for an era that has since passed into history along with the catchy Big Band music that went along with it.<br /><br />Speaking of past glory days, the world of professional boxing is portrayed in Raging Bull when it enjoyed its highest popularity. LaMotta, Sugar Ray and Joe Louis were kings; this was the era of boxing that just preceded the arrival of Ali.<br /><br />DeNiro's performance is stunning. One can easily see why he so desperately attempted to talk Scorsese into making Raging Bull; thankfully his arm twisting paid off. By now it's old news about how he put on 40 lbs of weight in order to portray LaMotta over the course of a twenty-five year span. People should rent the film simply to witness a method actor undergoing a fascinating on screen transformation.<br /><br />This really isn't a sports movie, it's a top shelf drama in which the main character happens to be a contending middle weight fighter.<br />The line in which Jake describes an upcoming opponent to a gangster over a drink: \\"He's so good looking, I don't know whether to 'blank' him or fight him\\" left me on the floor in laughter. Even if you don't enjoy sports you have got to give Raging Bull a try. Scorsese uses a color sequence only a few times when reflecting on LaMotta family videos, otherwise the bulk of the picture is shot in a beautiful and nostalgic black and white, which makes it hard to believe it was produced in the late 1970s.<br /><br />At the end of their final match, as soon as the bell rings to end the last round, a beaten and battered LaMotta walks over to Sugar Ray and says to him \\"Never went down, never went down, Ray; you never got me down, Ray.\\" That's sort of how this movie comes off, it will never lose its appeal.
B00005QCYC|5.0|This DVD set is an excellent opportunity to obtain the three movies inexpensively and with a free bonus disc of special features. The trilogy is terrific fun, with some of the most groundbreaking SFX you are likely to ever see, and an infectious sense of wonder and adventure. All three movies have had mixed reviews, but like the Die Hard series they are all different and strong movies in their own right. Personally, I like the second film the best - it gets straight into the action and never lets up, is more hard edged and genuinely scary than the other two, devotes more screen time to the wonderfully sardonic Jeff Goldblum, and is a real rollercoaster ride. The first film is almost as good, and will always be a favourite of mine since I will never forget seeing the T-rex for the first time at the movie theater and being awestruck (I still am). I think it takes too long to get going and to explain the premise, but once it picks it up, it is relentless. The third movie misses Spielberg's touch (he allowed Joe Johnston his dream to direct a JP sequel) and is far too short, but is an enjoyably straight forward action picture, if a little too similar to the first (down to the return of Sam Neill). With some great extras (documentaries, SFX featurettes, trailers, interviews etc) that actually may increase your knowledge of all things dinosaur and SFX, and a DTS mix for the third flick, this is a great set (almost as good as the Die Hard set) that is indispensable if you love the movies. And finally, the picture and sound on each disc is top notch too.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I am in awe of Wilco.  I always thought that Jay Farrar was going to be the one to create the best music post-Uncle Tupelo, and he still might.  However, Farrar is going to have to jump awfully high to exceed the pleasures of Jeff Tweedy's &quot;YHF&quot;.<br />Simply put, this is an amazingly well-done recording.  Everything about this band and this album is outstanding.  The musical skill, the emotional depth and the accomplished performances far out surpass almost everything made in recent memory.  I am quite sure it will go down as one of the finest recorded moments in the annals of rock music.<br />There are a lot of fine comments regarding this album on this site and they are all right on.  I just had to put my two cents in, also.  If you are curious about Wilco, do not hesitate to purchase this album.  You will not be disappointed.
B00005NRN9|4.0|The best video production of a Cirque de Soleil I have ever seen. The reason it gets 4 stars, because it's only 32 minutes long. I was still on my popcorn as the movie ended. It felt that the producers robed me. This DVD should have been called a trailer but not the whole feature. Otherwise it's so beautiful that I had to play it again. A word to the producers, please release part 2, and make it this time at least an hour long, let me finish my popcorn.
B000001FOL|5.0|The purpose of this review is not to comment on the music found on Nico's Chelsea Girl, which is by the way excellent. Instead I'm writing this to profess my frustration at the growing number of \\"hipster guides\\", as evidenced by the recent appearance of countless magazines dedicated to giving the average reader interested in the artists that bands such as the omnipresent Strokes ripped off a template for becoming another vomit-inducing indie kid. This includes pointless name-dropping in soundtracks like the Royal Tenenbaums soundtrack, wich includes two songs from this album. My outright hostility to this sort of thing comes not from any  desire to keep decent obscure music in the hands of a small group of \\"elite\\" individuals, but instead to prevent albums like Chelsea Girl from being trivialized and misunderstood by a fanbase that would have never discovered them on their own, thereby taking away from the personal connection that certain listeners have to this kind of music.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Not an awful movie like everyone says.  Full of action and cool shots.  Nice twist on the ending.  Cool deleted scenes and 2 alternate endings.  One is worthwhile and the other kind of bites.  Don't believe the hype, if you like action and innovative camerawork, then this movie would suit you.  Don't think that it will become a classic, you'll probably watch it once.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I can't say enough about how amazing this album is.  The bittersweet emotion and personal insight in the lyrics, the dense, creative and original arrangements, the soulful and masterful performances.  Every song blows me away.  I love it!  Some day this will stand out as a classic of its time...
B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm a huge Savage Garden and Darren Hayes' fan. But I have now become a huge John Mayer fan. His whole albumn has great songs in it. His songs have a lot of substance. He has catchy tunes that won't get annoying after a while. He's very romantic. I compare his style of writing to Savage Garden and Darren Hayes, although to some people, I may sound crazy. But I'm just giving my opinion. I suggest you borrow the cd from someone you know and listen to it and if you like it, buy it. I LOVE THIS ALBUM
B00003CXXP|5.0|What a wonderful new and fresh look at an age old tail of a wooden or robot boy wanting to be a real boy.As you know i'm not one for special effects but the effects in this movie do not take away from the wonderful acting of Haley Joel Osment. His acting was so convincing and believable that your heart will break wide open at the climax of this great movie.This is a kind of story that you will not forget soon. The haunting music score will tug at your heart and will give you a strange appreciation for being a human.  This is one of the most powerful motion pictures i've seen in a long time.  Be prepared to cry,,,,,it will totally catch you off guard.

6302491940|5.0|The Caper genre has been around for a long time but isn't seen all that much these days or, in my mind, done as well. The latest, of course, was the REMAKE of \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" and the REMAKE of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\", both not as well done as the originals. And, then, there is the remake of \\"The Italian Job\\".      However, for what it is, this original version is still a very fun film and is definately one of the all-time Car Buff favorites because of the Minis and, unlike some, Car Buffs enjoy ALL the Mini scenes, especially the practice sessions (much more fun than the remake's). The ending theme song is still hugely popular with British car lovers.     By today's standards the original \\"The Italian Job\\" may seem lame to the younger crowd since there are no hotshot special effects...or loads of dead bodies. And English humor is, well, different than Americans'.  On the other hand, all the car stunts are real and fun and the cast does not take themselves too seriously. The movie isn't as slick as the new version with Mark W., but I still like it more. It is a very 60s movie.    For one thing, there is more to the getaway than the remake. However, just like the remake, the crew is stealing money from the Mafia, but, unlike the remake, the ending isn't as tidy and happy for the robbers. Funny as can be, but not exactly happy. It's a real cliff hanger.    This movie is also timely right now since BMW has introduced the new retro designed Rover MINI to the U.S. market. And, as a matter of information, used/restored \\"old\\" Minis are still being imported to the U. S. in decent numbers by private individuals. I've heard that there are an estimated 10,000 classic Minis still in the U.S. I belong to a Mini club in Texas with well over 100 members. Many, like myself, own more than one and many also own the new BMW MINI.     The only odd aspect about this movie is why it took so long to finally be offered on tape and then, after a couple of years, get down to such a great price since Michael Caine starred in it. I can remember waiting and waiting for this movie to be released on VHS.  Something along the lines of the wait for \\"LeMans\\". And, then, it wasn't cheap. The new DVD is much better quality of course and well worth the money.  The DVD's extras are good, too.
B0000047CX|5.0|These songs knocked everyone off their feet when they debuted at what seemed to be the end of the Bossa Nova craze --in the cool-post-Beatnik 60's cocktail era. But actually, in Brazil, the Bossa Nova fever never did quite cool off and in '72, when I was visiting family there, this album was still trotted out proudly at every gathering.<br />Not only is this album a great party CD for &quot;retro&quot; parties, relaxed evenings or just sitting at home and relaxing, but it introduces you to the greats of Brazilian music. Oh, there is a whole lot more great Brazilian music than just this, but this album is surely the place to start.  (By the way, if you have insomnia, this can be quite soothing. Lie back on that imaginary beach in Rio and float away on Gilberto's soft voice. Mmmmmmm....)
B00005OAIE|5.0|Hey...Sitting home alone on a Friday night and wishing that you had some good tunes to take your mind off things??...The magic cure for your blues is your friend and mine...John Mayer and &quot;No Such Thing&quot;...and if your thinking to yourslef...Gee Whiz, Should I hop into my car and drive to the record store and spend my well-spent money on this dude...YES YES YES...You won't be dissapointed...TRUST ME...John Mayer has a way of putting many different emotions and fitting them into a square plastic case just waiting for you to indluge into...I can't physically make you go out and buy the C.D., but I can tell you that this C.D. is well worth the green paper that fits so neatly into your wallet and I reccommend that you pick up your own copy of &quot;No Such Thing&quot;...you won't be dissappointed...I promise.
B00005JL3A|5.0|If you are looking for a great movie to see, one that will scare you but not to the point where you think about it all night, with some great special effects, some intense chase scenes and a suprise ending, this is your perfect choice.  While it isnt overly scary, they do a great job on make-up with the zombies.  The plot is very easy to follow and keeps you on the edge of yours seat the whole time.  There are some great performances by the 2 lead roles, and the movie keeps a mysterious, dark undertone throughout the movie like is felt in the video game.  If you enjoy the video game you are going to love this movie, although it is hardly even loosely based on the video game.  But since this is coming out to video soon, this is a great movie to rent and have fun with.  This movie isnt meant to be overly scary or original, as it does borrow from other zombie movies heavily.  Its meant to be one hell of a fun ride and thats exactly what it is!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is the perfect Thrash album. Any Hardcore metal fan would need to have a copy of this masterpiece. The speedy riffs are a trademark for bands such as Slipknot and Harebreed. <BR> <BR>     I was amazed by the heavyness of the record for beening from the 80's. Also would recomend Testament, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse, and Megadeth.
B0000640SA|2.0|Remember the Dana Carvey comedy &quot;Clean Slate&quot;? if not you probably won't mind that Momento is the non-comedy version of this Dana Carvey dud.  The plot is fine, the acting is fine, the backwards story isn't as good as the backward episode of Seinfeld, but still fun.  Basically this movie got some good hype early on, and has been too ARTSY for anyone to disagree.  Not a waste of money, but not nearly as fresh or clever or new as it would like to be.  A solid movie borrowing heavily from other sources. If one is not familiar with these other works, I am sure Momento is compelling, on the other hand, anyone who watches TV or film regularly will be dissapointed.
B00000K19E|5.0|I've never written a one-line review before, but here goes:  The Matrix is the best movie EVER.
B00006690G|5.0|Finally, the album we've all been waiting for.  This one is definitely a must buy.  On this CD Em has embarked on a new and deeper level of music.  The CD doesn't feature the Public Service Announcement, but thats alright(We all know what to expect anyway . . . right?)<br />    The album features songs that talk about how he's had so much impact on the youths of America.  The results and the consequences.   \\"White America,\\" \\"Without Me,\\" \\"Sing for the Moment\\" and \\"When the Music Stops\\" are some examples.<br />    Other songs feature personal and emotional soul searching and reminiscing: \\"Cleaning Out My Closet,\\" \\"Say Good-bye to Hollywood\\" and \\"Halie's Song\\"(He sings in this one!).<br />    Lets not forget about the skits: \\"The Kiss,\\" \\"Paul Rosenburg\\" and \\"Steve Berman.\\"  These'll all make you laugh one way or another.<br />    Then, there are the songs where he gets serious and tells us his stories of tribulation, who he is and how nothing will stop him.  \\"Square Dance,\\" \\"Soldier,\\" \\"Superman\\" and \\"'Till I Collapse.\\"<br />    This album gives you a strong feel and connection the way the first one did.  The best part of it all is that its the brutal honesty, wit and fact that separates him from every other rapper out there.<BR>    <BR>   Many of you may and probably will interpret each song in different ways and come up with your own opinions.  Whatever I guess.  The point is, we've definitely never seen this side of Shady and this one should not be overlooked.  Those of you who were disappointed with the last album will be quite pleased with this one.  The same goes for those of you that did like it.  So buy it already!
B00005RIKD|1.0|Well it looks like people either like it or hate it. I can honestly say I hated it. I am a big fan of Sting and admire the way he has explored new territory, but this is wrong. Oh so wrong. He totally demolishes his old songs. What I consider in praise of a project is \\"Will I listen to it again?\\" Uh, no!!! Sting needs to reserve a project like this when he gets into his golden years and is playing in some lounge. That's when this would somehow be appropriate.
B00000K19E|5.0|I wish Amazon would allow \\"10\\" Stars! Hands down, The Matrix is the greatest science fiction movie of all time. Need i say more? It has it all.
B000067CPX|3.0|I come to the RHCP relatively late, having only really listened to Californication. By comparison I must say By The Way is a disappointment, full of melodic ditties which wouldn't be out of place on one of the more mellow REM albums but which are a pale imitation of the band's earlier work. There are some nice tunes on this album but no real punchy classics. I predict this will soon be forgotten.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is the ultimate psychotic mystery. Does society have the right to overpower evil for the sake of good by taking away one's right to choose? The book explores the difficulties of reconciling the conflict between individual freedom and social order.<br />Alex, the story's protagonist is a child of the corrupt totalitarian society. He acts out the evil crimes against society without thought of retribution. Are there limits to which society should go in maintaining law and order? Should society do the wrong thing for the right reason, even though it frequently does the right thing for the wrong reason? The state's attempt to eliminate evil is an assault of the self because goodness is no virtue if it has not been chosen.<br />The fundamental reasoning of the book is that free will defines humanity and represents the curtailment of choices as intrinsically wrong. A Clockwork Orange reprehends behaviorist conditioning for its infringement of free will. The story is a very thought provoking read. It not only addresses issues of good and evil but what is good without evil. One needs to look beyond the sex and violence to grasp the intense meaning of the story.
B00005RDAF|3.0|I liked this...but it could have had more.It has the videos for \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know\\"(which I was wondering if it was going to get on a DVD.Much like\\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\".)And the unoffical videos for \\"Not A Girl\\"and\\"Overprotcted\\".If you're wanting to get all the Britney DVDs but only one at a time I would wait and get this one last.It was good but not as good as the others(Time Out with Britney and Britney Live and More)
B000067CPX|2.0|I was a huge fan of Californication, and supportive of RHCP's turning away from white funk towards California-style rock.  By the Way definitely continues this trend, but unfortunately the quality of songwriting is nowhere near as strong as it was on Californication.  The first few times you hear the songs on By The Way, you'll note how catchy they are.  However, they do not stick in your head and &quot;catchy&quot; turns to &quot;boring&quot; after a few listens.  This CD is already collecting dust on my shelf...
B000066744|5.0|I first heard about this movie from my father who saw it on a plane and loved it.  At that time it was unreleased in the US but I, somehow and oddly enough, was able to see it on a cable movie channel.  I LOVED the movie and had to see it again.  I was so excited to see that amazon was carrying such a beautiful movie that has, undoubtedly, not receieved nearly enough recognition.  The Legend of 1900 is one of the most amazing movies that I have seen and has an amazing soundtrack to accompany it.  Why this movie has not recieved the recognition it deserves, I do not know.  But I do know that this movie is an amazing story that is unique and incredible.  Today's films are lacking everything that his movie has.  An amazing cast, good music and more importantly an orginal and captive plot line that has you paying full attention all the way through.  Bravo to Tim Roth for a beautiful, beautiful performance in this magnificent film.
B000002UD1|5.0|Good music. Catchy songs. Wonderful lyrics. This is John Lennon at his best (thankfully Yoko-free).
044022165X|5.0|First of all, let me say that I am 16 years old and I really enjoyed this book. I originally decided to read this book because I wanted to watch the movie. I figured reading the book would give me an idea of what happens in the movie. I wasn't expecting much, and I thought I would be clueless since I know nothing about how the law works. &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; however, was quite easy to understand, and even humorous at times. I really liked it a lot. This book is hard to put down, and I will be reading more books by John Grisham in the future, for sure! I think people in their teens will should definitely give &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; a chance, it was very interesting. It's my favorite book!
B000063DFN|5.0|Where to begin with this album? It's packed with 8 riveting tracks. And if your one who judges an album on its opening song, your praise would be through the roof for this one. You can't improve on the first track being ACES HIGH. The lyrics describe, in an incredible wealth of detail, (the first 2 \\"paragraphs\\" only get the plane in the air)  a bomber in the heat of battle. This is got to be one of the strongest and most catchy tracks on the album, but this is just the beginning. 2 MINUTES 2 MIDNIGHT is next. Unlike most of Maiden's songs, which are written by Steve Harris (great bass player), the lyrics of 2 MINUTES 2 MIDNIGHT were generated by singer Bruce Dickinson and the great guitarist Adrian Smith. This is a hard classic that you have to love. It's a long song, but never loses its energy or momentum. LOSFERWORDS is a terrific and clever title for an instrumental. I believe that this was only their 4th instumental song ( the others are Transylvania, Ides of March and Genghis Khan). This was, however, there best one yet so far. It rides a kind of roller coaster; it builds up and then drops slightly deeper then rises again. You have to hear this song to understand it and it'll knock your socks off. FLASH OF THE BLADE is an amazing song with power and speed that can only be expected from Maiden. THE DUELLISTS is about a duel (duh!). I like it because the song pretty much maintains a steady melody except for the chorus. It rises up into a small crescendo and then drops you back into the song. Very fun to listen to. BACK IN THE VILLAGE is an interesting song that has diffrent side of Maiden but, it's still enjoyable and I like it. Then comes an ominious beginning to a song. A steady sound like whistling wind. Then it kicks in, a heavy thudding of the music. This is POWRESLAVE the title track. And what a track it is! It has the Egyptian kind of guitar tune, which sounds hilarious in among Dickinson wailing the lyrics and te rest of the instruments that are putting out Maiden's usual notes. It is a great song and certainly deserves to be the title track. RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER concludes the album, but when you come to its beginning, don't expect leave for a while. This is a long song, based on the poem, and it's awesome. You have to love it. I encourage any of you who haven't got a copy of this to buy one fast. It's to good to miss!!!!
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is porbably my fave Green Day cd.  I love every song.  Warning is hella good, so is Minority.  Macy's Day Parade is another really good song.  Buy this cd only if you like Green Day one iota.
B00004RD54|3.0|I have owned this album on vinyl for [gulp!]over 25 years. There have been several times when I have sold dozens of old albums to finance new purchases....but this album has always survived the dumper! Why? Simply because the amazing long opening introduction to &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; is such a great piece of fantasy guitar music that I cant bear to part with it! The moment when Lou actually begins to sing is surely one of rock musics major anti-climaxes after such a dazzling build up.....he must have been literally cowering in the wings at the prospect of having to follow such a brilliant prelude! The rest of the album is ok - but after playing &quot;Intro/Sweet Jane&quot; I usually switch to the recently remastered version of the Velvets &quot;Loaded&quot; [check the superb originals of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;/&quot;Rock n'Roll&quot;]...then dig out The Stooges &quot;Fun House&quot; which is THE album to play if you want a real walk on the wild side!
B000007T1M|5.0|S.O.A.D. is an awsome band, i don't really like a whole lot of nu-metal but i can stand them.  TThe message to some of their songs is amazing, and they can get you thinking.  Spiders is a good song, but my favorite would be Sugar.  Buy this album.

B000066NW0|4.0|For the past few days, I've been listening to this album, and it's quite good considering Avril is only 17 years old. Songs like \\"Losing Grip\\" \\"Complicated\\" \\"Mobile\\" \\"Tomorrow\\" \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" and \\"My World\\" are awesome. The lyrics on this album are good, and the choruses are all good and catchy. Go get this album.
B000008H1W|5.0|This is and excellent example of classic Jethro Tull. It has some fast, powerful songs, as well as some smooth, soft ones. The best comparison I can make to another album is &quot;Every Good Boy Deserves Favour&quot; by the Moody Blues. By this I mean(as any Moody Blues fan will probably agree) that you have to listen to this album more then once to appricate all the songs. Some of the songs, like the title track, will probably appeal to you at once. Others, like Requiem, really need to grow on you. <br />  This is one Jethro Tull album you either like or don't like, I feel.
0393312836|5.0|I read this book for a college English assignment.  I had never watched the movie, so I knew nothing about the plot.  This was a book I read as quickly as I could from start to finish.  I was extremely disappointed when I saw the movie.  I don't think it captured the essence of the book at all.  I would like to thank my English professor for having us read this book!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Although not my favorite Jethro Tull album(that would be &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;), it is still and excellent album. It has a lot of great songs, I personally like all of them except &quot;Slipstream&quot;, and the added tracks are great. I really like &quot;Lick Your Fingers Clean&quot;, although it's a little rough around the edges. The Ian Anderson interview is interesting too. If you want to get into Jethro Tull, this is an excellent place to start.
B000000OQF|5.0|I remember being in the halls of junior high school when everywhere I turned there was the back of a black t-shirt with the words \\"Guns N' Roses, Appetite for Destruction\\" typed in yellow and red. Never has a hard rock act captured the imagination of millions like Guns N' Roses did in 1989. From top to bottom this mega metal debut burned white hot, from the opening screech of Axl's devastating howl in the opus \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" through the closing syrupy-sweet sentiment in \\"Rocket Queen.\\" Side 1 (\\"Jungle\\" through \\"Paradise City\\") is the strongest hard rock material ever released at once. \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" is a scorching set that kicked everybody's ... 12 years ago and will do the same for new listeners. This record contains an amplitude of profanity, however, and thus is not suitable for all listeners. For those who don't mind the regular use of the \\"f\\" word will be blown away by high octane numbers like \\"Nightrain,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" and \\"It's So Easy.\\" I will never get over \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\" It was and still is the best that will ever be released.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I feel Jetro Tull contains some excellent musicians(although they never manage to hang around) and so I had no doubt when I bought this album that it would be good, I just didn't know it would be as good as it turned out to be. It is my favorite album by them. It is, in my opinion, their best album, outdoing even Aqualung and Crest of A Knave. It has excellent music, exceptional lyrics, and it just flows from one part to the next beautifully. The added live version is good, but it could be longer. The interview is alright once or twice, but it isn't wonderful, but after such a performance on the preceeding tracks, it would take a lot to be considered, good. After all, it's only them talking. Still, it's nice to hear the story behind the album. This CD is, without a doubt, on my list of top ten albums ever.
B000065U1N|5.0|Though I thought it impossible, this movie's intensity out does that displayed in Saving Private Ryan.  Both are remarkable films in their own right, but this movie takes battle intensity (for the viewer) to an entirely new and prolonged level.  One thing I have noticed with other reviews, that many complained that it was too much for them, too intense, not enough character development.  What you as the viewer have to remember is that this is their story, the Rangers, Delta and Night Stalkers.  It is, in many ways, more for them than for us.  It's probably as clear and realistic a depiction of the nightmare these men suffered and fought through as any that has ever been brought to film before.  What they experienced, I'm sorry to say was - more likely than not - a lot worse, more horrifying and more intense than anything we witnessed in this film.  This film left me drained.  Emotionally and physically.  I was, and still am, shocked by what I've seen.  However, the bottom line for me is that this movie left me with an even greater degree of respect and pride for those who serve in all our military services, but even more so for those who volunteer for service in these elite units.  If these men can deal with the real horrors of combat, then I figure that the least I can do is to sit through their story and take away from it all that I can.
0609610570|4.0|Bossidy and Charan's book has a simplicity in its advice that is a breath of fresh air after much of the new economy hype that has filled the bookshelves in the past few years.  The book argues that the primary reason for much of the poor corporate performance we've seen in the past few years (outside of outright dishonest companies like Enron, WorldCom, and their ilk) has not been muddled strategy, lack of innovation, or an ever more rapidly changing marketplace but poor execution.  Conversely, they argue that great execution has been one of the cornerstones for the great corporate success, such as General Electric.  (Jack Welch looms large in the background here.)  And good execution is a lot more commonsensical than you might think:  it is merely insuring that corporate strategy is well-conceived and solidly grounded in the company's human and operational capacities.  <br />This is a difficult subject for a book, because there is no cookie-cutter methodology the authors could provide that could help you drill deeply into your own company's strategy, staffing, and operational plans and really root out the strengths and the weaknesses of them.  Good execution, they argue, has its roots in asking good probing questions, questions that will be different in each situation. The authors include a number of general questions in each area to help begin this probing, but that's about as far as a book can take it.  The bulk of the book, though is anecdotes illustrating how this has worked either well or poorly at other companies.  If you're looking for clear-cut instructions, this is likely to be disappointing.<br />What is most interesting about this book is how well it dovetails with Jim Collins' recent bestseller &quot;Good to Great.&quot;  Collins' book describes the general patterns to successful corporate change (or execution).  Bossidy and Charan's book describes some of the nuts and bolts needed to follow that pattern, from styles of leadership, getting the right people in the right jobs, doing honest assessments of a company's capacity, and then working toward goals with great focus.  If you enjoyed Collins' book, this book can help you figure out better how to make great execution happen in your own company.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|it was a great movie if you can sit through songs. (which i can) my heart was with it the whole way. the fact that ewan mcgregor and nicole kidman actually sang it makes it all the more better. great movie. ~imlossiel
B000002H97|5.0|Without a shadow of a doubt, this recording, dubbed \\"The Black Album\\", has appeal for all rock fans. Metallica jumped into the 90's with a series of catchy songs that were a little lighter, and a little shorter, than their previous material, thanks largely to their new producer Bob Rock. The Black Album has sold over 15 million copies, which makes it Metallica's most popular album. Unlike their previous works, only a few songs shine on this album, and the rest are somewhat lackluster. Many fans consider this album to be their sell-out point. Nonetheless, any serious Metallica fan will own this album, as there are several songs worth noticing.<br /><br />Here's a quick look:<br />Enter Sandman - It's one of the most well known rock songs ever recorded. You've heard it before somewhere, even if you don't recognize the name.<br />Sad But True - A great song with killer riffs. For some reason, people don't like the lyrics, but I think they're very meaningful.<br />The Unforgiven - Another song with awesome rhythm and beats. My personal favorite Metallica song.<br />Wherever I May Roam - Very unusual beginning that morphs quickly into headbanging hard rock. One of my favorites.<br />Nothing Else Matters - Metallica's slowest song, this proves that they're even capable of writing a beautiful love song.<br /><br />The other songs are iffy; some like them, some don't. I'll leave that up to you. But at least half of this album is very solid, and I consider it a must-have.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|i didn't like this movie at all. i was willing to give it a try but after the first half hour... i think its a little too sappy how everything turns out all right. and i think they should have included more about the truth of his life. they took out a lot about him thats actually pretty important. ok that and how it took home best adapted screenplay over lord of the rings is completely beyond me. howard totally remade the story while jackson stayed totally true. :( that and it's not very interesting, especially when you don't know what the heck is going on (maybe that's the point but some of us don't like it)
B000068PQ0|5.0|Well, besides I-35, I-40, and I-44?<br />This is one dense album, with Brothers Karamazov-ian musical phrasing that doesn't get followed through, a story that seems to be written to the music rather than the other way around, and a lot of aural weirdness. And it all works surprisingly well. <br />There have been a lot of long-time fans who have been complaining that the Lips have abandoned their usual guitar-based sound, but I think this is more an evolution than a change. Tell me how you could make this album with anything BUT this strange cross of trip-hop and prog rock. And again, it all works. The two obvious singles (\\"Fight Test\\" and \\"Do You Realize???\\") are stunning pieces of pop music, but other tracks show this strange merger of different musical forms.<br />If you ever drive through Oklahoma City (or Tulsa for that matter) and play with the radio tuner, you can get three or four stations layered on top of each other fighting for space and your attention, pop country fighting with 70s rock, hip hop, and the faux alternative station. This is what songs like Yoshimi Pt. 2 and Ego Tripping sound like. <br />Like Kid A, it takes about 10-20 listens to figure out what's going on. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, the pop hooks demand you listen to it 10-20 times. One of the top three albums of the year by far, and maybe a hopeful sign that pop music may still rise from the detritus of Britany and the boy bands.
B00000DCHD|4.0|When one thinks about Billy Joel and his outstanding career, many superlatives come to mind: thought-provoking compositions, stadium sell-out crowds, adoring fans, gold and multi-platinum records, and last, but not least, the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (if Billy hasn't been inducted already). After the huge success of the 1977 release \\"The Stranger\\", it is highly likely that Mr. Joel began to achieve many of these above-mentioned accolades by the time \\"52nd Street\\" was released, making Billy one of the top ten best loved and most recognizable faces in the history of rock music. \\"52nd Street\\" shows Billy is quite capable of pulling out many different musical styles neatly housed in his well-oiled artistic arsenal. Yes, folks, Mr. Joel can and does it all on this spectacularly crafted release, as he really rocks out with fine-tuned precision in the angst-laden \\"Big Shot\\" and on the slightly down tempo \\"My Life\\", as well. Billy once again proves why he's the quintessential master of the ballad, as is clearly the case with the hit single \\"Honesty\\" and on the slow-burned non-single \\"Until The Night\\". Joel does jazz, too, as he puts a unique spin on the Steely Dan/Chicago-influenced \\"Zanzibar\\", bringing amazing results, no less. \\"Stiletto\\" has a certain jazzy flavor as well, although a tad more peppery and bouncier in spots than on \\"Zanzibar\\". For good measure, Billy adds a touch of doo-wop in the pacey \\"Half A Mile Away\\", and the short and suave title track closes out the CD on a positive note. Although \\"52nd Street\\" isn't exactly Rodeo Drive, it is still a nice, adventurous drive filled with wonder and awe at every turn. For best results, drive in a classic 1957 convertible (with the top down of course), and let the cool, gentle breeze calmly caress your cares away. \\"52nd Street\\" is fun, wholesome summertime driving (digitally remastered music) at its' best!
038533558X|5.0|I'm not going into the story line, as plenty of others have already done that very well.  All I'm saying is personnally I haven't read anything with the exception of Tell No One, as good as this book in months.  I read this book in less than 24 hours and I yes I work and have a family; I sacrificed sleep and I didn't eat.  It was that good.  It's better than a suspenseful movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the surprise plot twists.  This book keeps throwing those twists at the end of every chapter.  Wow.  Do yourself a BIG favor.  Buy this book and cherish every page.

B00005LQ6S|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that if you aren't a fan of the TV Highlander, this movie won't make much sense to you.  And even if you are (like me), the plot line was a little hard to follow.  If it weren't for that, I would have given it all five stars, but unfortunately, the plot isn't very accessible to fans of the first movie or any of the other movies.  <br />This is all made up for, however, by the fighting scenes which are really remarkable.  That alone is worth seeing the movie for!  I would really recommend it on that alone.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Seldom can an album truly claim to be a piece of history recorded for generations of musicians and laymen to enjoy for centuries to come. All of Stevie Wonder's albums from 1972 - 1980 (except perhaps the misunderstood Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants) are truly Milestones in Modern Music, but  Songs in the Key of Life's sheer epic nature ranks it above these masterpieces as the album Stevie will be most remembered for.<br />So what does this album have going for it? Well, we'll start with the most noticeable thing: This is a two disc set (two LP plus a special &quot;Something's Extra&quot; EP)! Length alone does not make an album great; that length has to consistant all the way through. this is especially important for an album that is this long. Many artists have attempted the two disc set with mixed results, but none can doubt that this is perhaps the best example of how to pull it off. From the opening &quot;Loves In Need Of Love Today&quot; to the after-hours &quot;Easy Goin' Evening (My Mama's Call)&quot; we hear nothing but sheer brilliance. <br />I must admit that I still am a little confused by the prescence of &quot;Contusion&quot; since it breaks up the musical flow a little. My personal favourites are &quot;I Wish&quot;, &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet&quot;, &quot;Ngiculela-Es Una Historia-I Am Singing&quot; and &quot;As&quot;. Out of those &quot;As&quot; is my favourite since it is the best lyrics I have ever heard set to music.<br />If the merits of this album are still not apparent to you, it obviously had an effect on songwriters right until the present. Let's have a look at how many songs from this album have been remade or reworked into new songs. Firstly, &quot;I Wish&quot; was famously sampled by Will Smith gor his collaboration with Dru Hill for &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet&quot; was remade by Wonder Sound-alike Donell Jones, Pastime Paradise was reworked into the Coolio classic &quot;Gangster's Paradise&quot;, &quot;Summer Soft&quot; was sampled for Carl Thomas' &quot;Summer Rain&quot; and &quot;As&quot; was remade by Mary J. Blige and George Michael. And those are ones that I can think off!<br />This album is definately a must for fans of this musical genius and those who are yet to discover one of the greatest recordings of all time

B00005JKGO|4.0|The beginning and end of this movie tell you everything you need to know: it opens high above Rome as a helicopter transports a larger-than-life image of Jesus through the air; and it closes at sea level as a dead seafish washes up on a beach. This is the metaphor for the moral descent of the film's protagonist, a gossip columnist. LDV is a cautionary tale of the temptations of the so-called \\"good life\\". It was the last of Fellini's so-called neo-realist, socially-conscious films before he embarked on his bizarre, ultra-personal, quasi-hallucinatory phase.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This film was excellent. For someone who hasn't read the book, there are some questions that aren't answered very well. My guess is that because it was three hours long already, something had to go!<BR>I enjoyed the young actors who play Harry, Hermione, and Ron. I thought Draco Malfoy's actor could use some work, but maybe the next movie will be better!
B00005YW4H|5.0|She has such a beautiful voice, each song sang with emotion and grace. Her voice reminds me of Emmylou Harris and Carol King.  An interesting blend of folk, jazz, and a little country without sounding hokey.
B00004RF9B|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a kid, and when I found it on DVD, I had to buy it. The movie itself is very good. It has a solid plot, and good acting. <BR>Now the bad news. The sound in this movie needs a little bit of help. The background &quot;noise&quot; in the movie is supposed to set a certain mood, but I find myself constantly changing the volume on my tv because the noise is earsplitting. This is really the only negative I have about the film.
0451191153|1.0|As much as Ayn Rand is praised for her insight, I found this, as well as Atlas Shrugged, to be predictable and pat. Rand's use of language is nothing special (even simplistic) and her philosophy seems dogmatic and out-of-date. In the cold war society in which this work was first published, it may have held some relevance, but, in the 21st century, it seems dated and glib.
0805062971|3.0|On rare occasions, there are movies that are better than the book they are based on.  Fight Club happens to be just one of those.  Admittedly, I didn't read the book until I'd seen the film several times.  I'm not sure that I'd feel otherwise had I first read the book.<br />The film hits everything right, where the book misses in several places.  While the story is great, the film does a better job of telling it.  I agree with the other review here that says to see the film before reading the book.
B0000057C5|4.0|this along with every other rammstein album rules!!
B00005ASHM|4.0|I think that Pet Sounds is a really fine album.  It definetly blows the Beach Boy's surf music right out of the water (no pun intended).  Although it is a very good album, it takes some time getting used to: it's not like anything, especially something from the Beach Boys, you've ever heard.  It has a slower pace, with a lot of attention to detail, and, of course, the Beach Boy staple: beautiful harmonies.<br />My favorite track has to be &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;.  The song kicks of the album in such an awesome way.  Almost every track is a highlight (most prominently &quot;Sloop John B&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;That's Not Me&quot;) and not one track is one to skip over while listening.<br />However much I like Pet Sounds now, it took a while for me to warm up to it.  I was expecting up-beat surf music, but got something differnt.  At first I was yawning, then intrigued and then, finally, enthralled.  I can see how many of the fans were disappointed, and how many critics loved it (they enjoy things that are unique and different then the mainstream).<br />I want to adress one more issue: a lot of people compare Pet Sounds to Sgt. Peppers by The Beatles, but I think they're different types of albums.  Pet Sounds was an album where each track was different and wonderful in it's own way, while Sgt Pepper's had more of an overall feel, a concept album if you will.  Also, Paul McCartney loved Pet Sounds, and, I beleive, tried to emulate it with the Beatles' Revolver.  If you listen to all three of these albums, I think you'll find that revolver is more like Pet Sounds.<br />Most importantly: Give Pet Sounds TIME.  Don't just dismiss after one listen.  Hear it a few times before you pass judgement.  You'll thank yourself for it.
B00005OMTT|5.0|Since its inception Enigma has created a new cult in music combining various genres to create a sound so distinct that one instinctly knows upon hearing that it is none other than Enigma. I started listening to Enigma - Sadeness my all time favorite, when I was only 13. Since then the music still has the ability to spell bind me. <br />Two years back I entered a club in NYC and Sadeness was echoing along the hallways - one had to only look at the effect it had on the people to see the change in body language. Enigma's music is simply very SENSUAL. It can put anybody in the mood for passion and desire......<br />I immediately purchased Love, Sensuality and Devotion without even glancing at the song list and all I can say that its contains the very best of Enigma - What more could I ask for? There is not a day that goes by where I have not heard Enigma on my stereo. It has the ability to relax me and change my mood no matter what.........<br />This is CD is PHENOMENAL..............
B0000640VO|4.0|This film has already been lauded to the skies so I don't need to add my praise. Instead, I'll point out what I think is wrong with this film, namely, its blatant and gratuitous self-consciousness and smugness. It's most blatant every time Amelie looks directly into the camera and smiles her knowing smile. It's only a little less obvious in the frenetic camera work: from dizzying birds-eye crane shots to disconcerting tilted frame compositions, from high-angle shots to low-angle shots, the camera practically screams, \\"LOOK AT ME!\\". Like the bumbler who has to blow his own horn because no-one else will do it for him, this movie tries too hard to draw attention to itself. If it were really as sweet as it wants us to believe it is, it wouldn't need to do this.<br />The only way around this indictment is if all this attention-seeking served some purpose other than horn blowing. The only purpose I can see is that the camera itself is a character in the film. Judging by the frequent use of high-angle and overhead shots, the obvious candidate is Fate or Destiny. The theme of falling and high places tends to support this idea. Think of the goldfish that was dumped out of its bowl and fell into the pond, or the woman from Quebec who jumped from the church steeple and fell on Amelie's mother, or the bar owner who was dropped by her trapezist lover and fell and broke her leg: these are all examples of the falling theme. Or think of the letters that were lost and discovered on the top of Mont Blanc, or the travelling gnome who flies with the airline stewardess, or Amelie herself, the 'agent' of Fate, who lives on the 5th floor, high above her fellow tenants: these are all examples of the high places theme. What all these images have in common is that Something from on high brought either tragedy or salvation to the people involved. It's as if Fate or Destiny was at work, bringing sadness or joy into people's lives. And the camera, which frequently takes the lofty overhead and high angle pov, is the apparent embodiment of this Fate or Destiny. And Amelie, when she looks into the camera, is really looking into the eyes of Fate, who she's in cahoots with, and saying, \\"hey Fate, did you like that! Wasn't that neat?!\\".<br />Well, there's a lot to recommend this view. Like the two themes discussed already. But there are scenes that contradict it. For example, the theatre scene when Amelie looks into the camera and says, \\"I like to look at the faces of people behind me!\\". The trouble here is that this scene happens before Amelie discovers her role as the agent of Fate. Who, then, is she talking to? The obvious answer is us, the audience. And why does she do this? Why, to draw attention to herself and how 'sweet' she is. And THAT'S the problem with this film.<br />It's as if between every few lines of this review I were to throw in a, \\"hey, aren't I clever?!\\", or a, \\"wow, ain't I smart?!\\". Rather than enhancing my argument it would obviously only detract - big time. My argument should speak for itself. It doesn't need my attention-seeking, self-congratulatory remarks to help it.<br />Same thing with a movie. It should stand on its own without some character repeatedly ejaculating, \\"hey, look at me! Aren't I sweet?!\\". Far from adding anything, these outbursts actually call attention to what's wrong with the film.<br />A good film, but not perfect. And certainly not one of the best films of all time!
0812550757|5.0|I enjoyed Ender's Game, so I read the sequel. I think Speaker for the Dead is better then Ender's Game. I think this is the best book in the Ender Series (Children of the Mind is a close second). This book deals a lot with the characters, and that makes it really good. I really recommend this book!
B00001OH7U|5.0|The fact that this only had six tracks on it scared me away from buying this at first, but being the Bowie freak that I am, had to buy it sooner or later. My main reason for not buying it is because I had a 'Best Of Bowie' import which featured half of the album's tracks already (albeit, edited single cuts). I could not be happier with this album after a couple listens.<br />All six cuts are pure gold and to my ears, and are instantly accessible, maybe less than say 'Changes,' or 'Let's Dance' but moreso than the instrumental side of \\"Heroes.\\" 'Ziggy' may be his most renowned album but it lacks the consistency of 'Station To Station.' 'Space Oddity' was a little rough around the edges, Bowie was still honing in his abilities, and just forget 'Tonight' when he rubbing elbows with Tina Turner and re-doing songs he produced for Iggy Pop. The title cut may be 10:11 long, but every second is used well, it might just be may favorite on the album. 'Golden Years' was the big hit and it deserves it every bit. 'TVC15' with its playful piano and 'Stay' with it's driving funk guitar lines make for upbeat songs ala 'Golden Years' while 'Word On A Wing' and 'Wild Is The Wind' are soulful, slower numbers.<br />Yes, that is all information you've heard from other reviews basically, because what is there to say that hasn't been said about this great mid-70's Bowie album? Pick it up, it deserves the 4.9 rating it's gotten, standing as Bowie's highest-rated album among reviewers.
0767802470|5.0|I remember the first time I watched Das Boot. It was before the English dubbing so was in German with sub-titles. Something about watching the drama unforld in the original German added to the suspense. Maybe because you had to concentrate more to follow the plot flow. Since then I have watched it a couple of times on TV and never recaptured the magic of that first viewing. The other night I watched it for the first time off the Directors Cut DVD and was mesmorized!!! I have since watched it in German w/subtitles, English, and English with the directors comments.<br />The movie itself is a lesson in dramatic film making. The story takes place in late 1941 when the war was beginning to turn against the Germans. The Captain is played brilliantly by a young Jurgon Prochnow. Basically the plot centers around one war-time patrol of a U-Boat captained by an experienced commandeer but staffed by very young and inexperienced sailors. The journey takes these almost children from early boredom to sheer terror and beyond. The filming of the action scenes makes you feel you are a part of the action with the fast camera motions and quick scene changes. What I really liked about this film above everything else is the contrasts director Wolfgang Peterson used throughout the film. One example: when the U-boat leaves the dock to begin their patrol we see a scene of smiling, youthful sailors waving as they head out to sea. Upon their return we're treated to a group of sullen bearded ancient sailors, showing no emotion upon arriving home. Great stuff.<br />I also love the options the DVD gives you. Again, you can watch it in German, German with sub-titles, English, and even in Spanish. I haven't done that yet. It includes a short film about the making of the movie which is highly interesting, and the directors comments.<br />I would highy recommend this to ANY movie buff, whether you are into war movies or not. This is SUCH a great movie experience.
B000067CQK|5.0|Ziggy Stardust is my favorite alblum/cd.  It got me through college.  I enjoyed the ziggy with bonus tracks available about 10 years ago.  However, this collection is better.  It includes the bonus tracks + additional tracks.
B00005JH7D|5.0|I have only one word for this CD: Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000DHRX|5.0|I think this greatest hits collection is the best because this greatest hits mostly every song on here was a top ten hit.  He also recorded some new songs.  The highlights of this album are \\"Faith\\" \\"Father Figure\\" \\"I Want Your Sex\\" \\"Too Funky\\" and \\"Freedom 90\\". Freedom 90 sounds so much better than the original.  The original sounds so cheesy.  My favorite song on here is \\"Father Figure\\" because it sounds so beautiful. This album did well on the charts for a two disc set selling over 2 million copies.   I recommend this album to anyone.
B000001ABD|1.0|While this cd contains alot of favorites, I feel that you should bypass this one, and purchase Stevie Wonder's At The Close Of The Century! By far, this is the best, as it contains virtually all of his all time hits.... YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!

0446310786|5.0|Usually I am against anything I have to read for school BEFORE I start to even read it. And then when I read it, usually it is boring anyway. Not To Kill A Mockingbird. I was ok about reading it for school, for I'd heard it was good. And it was. The story was great (and sad). The topics were really covered good. Ok, so it's about this girl (Scout) and her brother (Jem). Their dad is a lawyer who has to defend a black man against white people. This book was written to take place in a time where people are predjudice against black people, so a lot of people are against Jem and Scout's dad (Atticus) for defending the black man. But Atticus doesn't care. I hope this isn't getting too long and boring for people to read. There is another (smaller) plot in that there is a guy who never leaves his house. Scout and Jem and their friend Dill try different things to try to get him to leave his house. Does he? I'm not going to say. But even though I had to read this for school (with a teacher telling us that there was sybolism in an alarm clock, snowman, dog, and many, MANY other things, and I didn't understand any of the symbolism stuff) I thought this book was good! The message was great, and I highly reccomend To Kill A Mockingbird!
0316666343|5.0|I haven't read a heart-breaking page-turner like the Lovely Bones in a long time!  I couldn't put it down and devoured it in one sitting!   What a wonderful author Alice Sebold -- she beautifully writes how a family copes with the murder of their daughter Susie.  I can't wait to start reading her memoir \\"Lucky\\" next!
B00003CXI0|2.0|I saw this movie to see what the Harry Potter hysteria was all about.  Fifteen minutes into the show I was bored.  There was one interesting part where a character we thought was a bad guy turns out to be a good guy.  I think the three kids with the starring roles are good actors and cute kids though.  I just didn't think this was a very good movie.  I couldn't wait for it to end.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This film is an almost perfect example of how to thwart convention in film-making... From the stylised camera-work to the 'herrings' throughout it allows you to be both entertained and challenged throughout.<br />After the climax of the film you are left with many questions, and subsequent viewings are likely to reveal even more...<br />To say more would be to spoil the film, something I hate doing (and hate being done to me even more).
B00005YW4H|3.0|On one hand Norah's voice, I feel, Is very unique, smooth and quite, quite beautiful. As well, the first song on the CD is MAGNIFICENT! I have scarcely heard another jazz song that I loved this much! But after that, although there are still some good songs, many of them are a bit repetitive and seem to lack enough change throughout the song. Norah Jones seems like a pretty cool lady and she has a wonderful voice, but most of the tunes, I feel, are just mediocre.<BR> In the end, I think that if you would like some nice BACKGROUND music for, say, entertaining guests, that this would be a great CD for that. However, if you really want to just sit there and enjoy some music, it might not hold your interest.
079073804X|5.0|Scary... and funny at the same time... Unfortunately the hype surrounding the delay in the video release of this film spoilt the story, though one should not be discouraged from this intense, frightening story about Good vs. Evil
B000000WA4|5.0|Why did this band have to break up? Forget Nirvana, this is definitely the best 90's alternative rock bands. Billy Corgan says, &quot;If Nirvana were The Beatles of our time, consider The Smashing Pumpkins as The Doors of our time&quot;. And I definitely agree.<br />Before the greatest hits CD came out, this CD was the best introduction to this band. But it's still the first Pumpkins CD I'd buy.<br />I can't say much about this CD, because if I said everything I needed to say, it'd surpass 1,000 words. Just buy this CD.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Throughout this film you are given glimpses into events which precede those already seen, making for a unique film that raises the question, &quot;Can one trust one's own memory?&quot;...
B0000028RR|3.0|But at least these guys were original. That earns them a star. The songs &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, &quot;Bombtrack&quot;, &quot;Take the Power Back&quot;, and &quot;Bullet in The Head&quot; are great. That earns them another star. The last star goes for influence. Think about how many bands this band has influenced. Every rap-metal band has some influence from Rage Against The Machine.<br />So that's my review. You can buy the CD, or you don't have to. Your choice.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is one of my favourites... Looking at things below the surface, perceptions on how things can be different to how they appear... almost too perfect.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Even though I'm only a teenager, I have also grown up with Billy Joel (my parents are big fans). In middle school I bought his &quot;River of Dreams&quot; album on cassette and fell in love with it. I'm also a pianist, so I respect his musical ability so much and have Vol I and II for the piano. Just saw him in concert and he sings just as well as 20 years ago on his CDs.<BR>I have to agree that some of the songs are missing, but for those of us who want all the classics without buying all the albums, (or copying all our parent's records onto cassettes) it's a great album.
B0000399WI|5.0|Hope is a wonderful thing... as is friendship...<br />This film is a story which centres primarily around these two themes and is one of the most moving and uplifting films I have been fortunate enough to see... You don't want to know anything about the events in this film, just that it will change you.
B00005R2M3|5.0|First i want to say how admire shakira.Beacuse what she did. In this cd she wrote all the songs and produce the cd yeah, with a little help but thats why i admire her so much,and i myself wish for one day do that,i cant believe how she can find rhyming words for almost all of her songs.I like her work because it is very common in every person, many woman go trough what shakira says in her songs,shakira talks about love that is the main thing she writes about and i love them.She also talks about not letting her down and that she is ready for the (goodtimes),like she said in her songs.She also talks about having enough that she wont take it      <BR>anymore(objection) thats and example. She also talks about being a<BR>(fool),because she cant stop loving him, and she knows he finds new ways to hurt her everyday.And thats what i like about this<BR>album (Laundry service)because its very well the songs are common in every person young and old. Because many people have gone trough what the songs say.Yes i really recomend this cd is very good everyone will enjoy it as well as all of herother cds.But yeah i say i give this cd 5 stars because its very good the words are very good and the music this cd has balladsand songs you can dance to.
B000002LBH|5.0|The Smiths are a weird phenomenon. They have an immense and loyal following, yet, most have never heard of them. I have very un-intentional but sincerely eclectic tastes in music, so it may be confusing that one person would recommend both Patsy Cline and The Smiths, but, I like good music, and it comes in many styles. I've been listening to the Smiths for easily 20 years, and they have become a staple in my listening repertoire. I consider them one of the most innovative, charasmatic bands of all time. While they are comprised of individuals, as most bands are, I am ashamed to admit that I, like most, think of the band as Morrissey, the legendary lead singer. I must admit to liking almost everything they've ever recorded, but this c.d., \\"Louder Than Bombs\\", is my most often played. Their songs, which are really poetry, are set to music ranging from ethereally haunting to rapid-fire hardcore, and are never gimmicky or pretentious. I really wouldn't know how to recommend this c.d. , or the band themselves, to a new listener, because I can't think of anyone to compare them to. All I know is that I was hypnotized the first time I ever heard a note of their music, and it hasn't worn off yet. If you like The Smiths, you probably already love this c.d. If you've never before heard them, you may either think they're incredible, or rubbish, there are no in-betweens. But I consider this one of the better efforts from one of the best music making entities (\\"bands\\" just doesn't properly describe them) in the music world .
B00000JCOV|5.0|When I bought this CD I was worried because it was my first metal CD, and I wasn't sure if id like it. Well that soon changed! Slipknot is extremely talented band, and knows what they are doing. With an expressive voice, incredible guitars, loud drums and a cool turn table they throw a powerful punch. The CD is very strong and loud and makes you want to hit something or mosh with someone you don't even know. Forget those little trend followers that don't listen to they want and say slipknot [is bad] and buy this CD now!
B00006690G|4.0|I'm a 30-something hick from Wyoming who has never enjoyed rap (other than the good-old-days of RunDMC and the Beastie Boys). I decided to buy this album just to see what all the hype was about.  I'm impressed! I could care less about some gazillionair whining about what a messed up life he has created for himself.  But, Marshal's style, delivery and beat are awesome.  It may be misguided talent - but it is talent nevertheless!  I don't think this is music to live by - but it is damn entertaining!!!
B000000W5P|5.0|....Oh yes you do!!   Ronnie &amp; Keith weave the mighty guitar riff like no other.  This is their masterpiece.  Any rating lower than a 5 is from a Eagles, Michael Bolton, or Journey fan.<BR>The best Stones &quot;non-Mick Taylor&quot; album and the last great Stones album period (&quot;Tattoo You&quot; just doesn't hold up).  Alas....the band formerly known as the Rolling Stones is no more....   Cruely replaced by the &quot;Corporate Entity&quot; disguising itself as the once great rock band.  Kudos to Bill Wyman for having the &quot;stones&quot; to leave.

I finished each one with my mouth agape.<br />I wish I could give this one 6 stars.  <br />THIS IS A MUST READ SERIES!!!!!
B00000ILDE|3.0|If anyone was ever unsure about James Cameron's abilities as a director, they should watch this &quot;Special Edition&quot; of his 1986 masterpiece Aliens. This DVD features roughly 17 minutes of scenes that were cut from the theatrical release. After one viewing, I could understand exactly why Cameron elected to have them removed. The extra scenes have two very damaging effects on the film.<br />  First, the character of Ripley is changed in some subtle yet important ways. The revelation that she was a mother who lost her own daughter during her escape from the encounter with the first Alien changes her relationship with Newt, the lone survivor of the mining colony. She is much more emotionally driven in the uncut version, and her attachment to Newt is more selfish (to replace her own lost daughter) than the previous assumption that Ripley's concern for Newt stems from the fact that she too was the lone survivor of an Alien encounter. Instead of ensuring that Newt's nightmarish experience will end, she seems to be trying to fulfill a maternal role. While this may provide a little more depth to the character, it detracts from her image as an independent, hardened, and cunning survivor.<br />  The second problem with the Special Edition is much greater in scope and effect on the movie. The Theater version of Aliens was such a successful movie because it delivered unrelenting suspense. The audience could identify with the characters headed to investigate the &quot;lost mining colony&quot;, as we only knew as much as the characters themselves knew. A colony of miners had suddenly and unexpectedly gone silent. Therefore, every discovery, every decision made by the Marines built upon the sense that something very big and very wrong had happened. This sense of impending doom culminated in the first firefight between the Marines and Aliens. The rest of the movie successfully presented the desperate situation that the survivors had found themselves in.<br />  In contrast, the Special Edition eliminates most of that suspense. Not only do the scenes regarding Ripley's personal life slow down the pace of the movie from the start, there is an extended scene which details how the Aliens were brought into the colony. This one scene destroys the entire mood of the movie. There is no suspense or mystery as to what happened to the colonists after that scene. The audience knows what the characters themselves do not; the colony has been infested with Aliens. It is then difficult to share the character's anxiety and tension on the same level once we know what they do not.<br />  All in all, this is still a fantastic movie with superb acting, incredible special effects, and heartstopping action. I only wish Cameron had released this film in the style of Terminator 2:Ultimate Edition (this included both the uncut and theatrical versions).<br />  This version of Aliens is actually pretty interesting to watch. It provides a lot of interesting extra perspectives on the characters. But I wish I hadn't bought it. I can't see myself watching this version more than once or twice. If you are trying to convince someone that Aliens is a classic spine-tingler, this is not the edition to show them.st, the Special Edition eliminates most of that suspense.

B00001NTXN|5.0|I bought this game for my 11-year old son, and now I find myself asking everyone in my family if they can spare 15 minutes to play a game with me! The game play is simple: on each turn, either move your pawn one space closer to the finish line, or use one of your two-square wide tiles to block your opponent's progress (you start with ten of these), but you can't completely block them in. Whoever gets there first, wins! Each game takes on its own personality, as new strategies constantly evolve. We also handicap the grownups when they play the kids by allowing them to only use 7 or 8 of their tiles, which gives the kids a fair chance to win. Games take anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes to play, and the beautiful wooden gameboard and pieces are fun to use. Like chess and checkers, it's all skill and no luck. This has become my favorite game! I'd recommend it for anyone age 7 or older who likes thinking games.
B00005ATQE|5.0|..In my opinion, of course. I'm not a huge fan of war movies though, but this is an outstanding, anti-belic view here, with hilarious scenes (the first part of the movie is pure escaping sarcasm) and then some serious segments, more focused on the situations that soldiers have during battles. <br />R. Lee Ermey acts incredibly awesome and realistic here, as an instructor who screechs at the trainees all the time, mocking them up and encouraging them to believe that guns are important, but humans are the grand killer with it. Not to mention that it is said that is forbidden to die. <br />This movie debuted nearly after Platoon won a mainstream relevance, and yet I think this movie, even a little underrated, is much more interesting because it projects how things should have really worked out during the private's training for the Vietnam war (and the others too),the colateral effects it might affect them (look at private's Pyle) and the duality of man, as a being who is bewildered between peace and slaughter (the duality of man, as private Joker mention.), trying to conceive what is best: what he is told to do or what he believes is necessary to be done.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It takes a lot to impress me but John Mayer won me over the first moment I played this cd.  The lyrics are fun and playful but touching and meaningful at the same time.  I encourage everyone to buy this as soon as they can.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is a great 'new' album. Yes, it has a very stong influence from the Velvet Underground, the Stooges, and many of the great bands that made music great in the 60's/70's. Stop complaining about these strong ties! What made music great then can still spawn great music now! It can't replace the classics that will always be fantastic to listen to, but what it can replace is all that terrible teen pop, N'Sync Backstreet Boys Britany Spears! They can't even play instruments!<br />If imitation is what it takes to save us from the terrible force of teen pop then please, imitate! <br />The Strokes have created a beautiful album, and i highly recommend it, evey track is great and i can't seem to get tired of the catchy riffs and intriguing lyrics.

0312965788|5.0|The only warning I give before you start to read this book is that you must be willing to donate many hours because this book will make you want to read every single one of James Herriots books. \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" is a fabulous book. Currently I am going to school to become a veterinarian (including the cow degree) and after sifting through this book I knew that every person who wants to become a vet should read this book.<br />Not only does it show the joys of bringing a struggling lamb in the world, or pulling a dying animal back from the brink of death, it also displays the downfalls of being a vet. The unexpected nightly calls, the confusing symptoms, and the claws and teeth that are attached to each patient are all also a part of being a vet.<br />Through it all James Herriot shows a deep love of his profession which cannot help but bring a smile to the readers face.<br />I recommend this book to any animal lover from cats to cows, James has to fight with them all in the England countryside.
071198042X|5.0|I will say, on the one hand, I am not a \\"die-hard\\" Queen fan, nor am I a \\"die-hard\\" Freddie Mercury fan. On the other hand, I do enjoy Queen's music.<br />The intent on buying this book, as in any biography, is to learn about the birth, career, and so on of the person in which the biography is based. That is not the case for this book.<br />At first, I was a bit dissapointed to discover that I would not learn about Freddie's birth, childhood, his early carrer, the founding of Queen as a band, as well as the birth of Queen's successes.<br />The book opens in 1979. That is when the author, Peter Freestone, began working for Queen; his original job was to make all the costume changes ready, during Queen's concert performances. His job descriptions, and responsibilities increased as time went on, and he began working solely for Freddie, himself.<br /> 'I was Freddie's chief cook and bottle washer, waiter, butler, secretary, cleaner..and agony aunt',writes Peter Freestone (quoting from the back cover, to give an insight as to the various responsibilities he had while employed by Mercury.)<br /> 'I travelled the world with him, I was with him at the highs and came through the lows...I acted as his bodyguard when needed and in the end, of course, I was one of his nurses.'<br /> This is, indeed as the title states, an intimate look at the man who is Freddie Mercury, written by someone who became one of Freddie's closest, most trusted friends.<br />But, it only covers the 12 years that Freestone knew, and worked for him.<br />The last 2 chapters are especially touching. Peter Freestone was there when Freddie passed away, in 1991, and he shares a very personal account of the goings on before, during, and after his death.<br />What I learned, and appreciated about this intimate memoir, was how generous, and giving Freddie was. He was a loyal friend. He treated those who worked for him as close friends.<br />This book was excellent reading, for what it was; and what it was, was an intimate portrait, getting to know Freddie Mercury on a personal level (kinda like getting a backstage pass, so to speak), learning things that would be, otherwise private.te portrait, getting to know Freddie Mercury on a personal level (kinda like getting a backstage pass, so to speak), learning things that would be, otherwise private.
B000056K04|4.0|Listen to all the 4 and 5-star reviews.  Most of them admit this isn't the best DMB album, but there's really no reason to trash it just because it sounds a little different.  This reminds me of when Metallica released their self-titled \\"black album\\".  It was a departure from the old days because the songs were simpler and had a much sharper production.  People cried sellout, and some still do today, but it remains a classic metal album.<br />Now, DMB decides to do something a little different, and here come all the 'old-school' fans who whine and cry about how this album isn't the same as the older albums.  This has happened, in some way, to every DMB release since Crash came out.  I, for one, wouldn't like it if every album was the same as the last.  It would just be boring.  <br />The sound is indeed different on this album, but the jazzy feel is still there, and contrary to what has been said, Lenori and Boyd's instruments can still be heard.  Overall, the album has a more organic feel to it, while the title track is more upbeat than the rest.  For those who've only heard \\"I did it\\" and \\"The Space Between\\", it's worth checking out.
B000067JHW|5.0|As someone who rarely watches a movie twice and buys them even less often, i saw this movie twice in the theater and will be buying the dvd.  The movie is fast paced and has a wonderful assortment of sub-plots, and is just so crammed full you have to watch it more than once to absorb it all.  I do not get everyones referance to ally mcbeal- seems like comparing an exquisite french delight to hostess ho-ho's. This is an extrodinary film - i will be sending the dvd out to my friends and family for birthdays and Christmas presents. It's hard to pick a favorite scene as there are SO many but, without blowing it for you, its the one with Amelie and the blindman. I cant wait to see the dvd version with the extra scenes, screen tests etc.
6305171769|4.0|This was an excellent movie, except for the end.  The scoop is basically Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has changed her name and moved to CA to escape her homicidal brother, Michael Myers.   Now a teacher at a college university, Laurie now has a son, Jimmy, who gets into a little mischief while Laurie is getting ... by her counseler boyfriend.  Michael is especially creepy in this one, we can see his menacing eyes finally and his killings are a lot more gory, but the body count is even less that in the first Halloween.  Sadly, there is no Dr. Loomis here, but the film starts off with him telling the story of Michael in the first movie.  LL Cool J is in this one, too, which adds to the enjoyment, and that is because he delivered quite a performance in Deep Blue Sea, why shouldn't he be in Halloween: H20?  Now, you may think I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do!  In conclusion, Halloween: H20 is definately worth the time, so pick up your copy today!
B000002L5P|4.0|It's hard to realize, now that The Smiths enjoy an almost legendary status, just how different this album sounded when it came out. This, the debut album from The Smiths, came out in 1984, a year in which New Wave was king, and even former hard rockers such as Van Halen had taken to crafting synth-pop. Although Johnny Marr's gently rolling guitar riffs were not radically different from British pop that had come before, it was radically different from what was in vogue at the time, and everything about The Smiths - from their image, dress and appearance, to cover art, and, especially, the lyrics and singing of enigmatic lead singer Morrissey - hit you in the face with their sheer vitality, originality, and freshness. Morrissey's lyrics are what really set the band apart - few of the songs followed traditional verse/chorus structures, his lyrical pacings being almost free-flowing at times - and he sang them in the odd croon (it may turn you off at first, but will eventually grow on you) that is distinctly his. He also chose to tackle subjects that were more than the standard rock fare: in addition to delving deep into harrowing portraits of love won and lost and teenage angst, he also dives into such topics as infanticide (Suffer The Little Children), literary adaptations (Reel Around The Fountain), seeming misogyny (Good Girls Make Graves), and a song apparently about homosexuality, or perhaps masturbation (Hand In Glove.) However, the music - not only that of Marr, but also the solid if unshowy rhythm section - perfectly complimented the music, making for a killer combination and, it is often said, perhaps the last great songwriting team in rock. Although The Smiths would go on to make better and more ambitious albums, their debut announced the arrival of a fresh, exciting, original, and invigorating new band, and remains an essential album and snapshot of the 80's to this day.

0316666343|5.0|This is one of my 2 favorite first novels I've read recently (the other is Art Corriveau's 'Housewrights').  Alice Sebold has delivered a truely original novel, written with stunning clarity.  A truly remarkable first novel in so many respects.  So very beautifully and crisply plotted.  And the writing is so clear, as befits the narrator.<br />Holden Caufield says you know you've read a great book when you wish the author were your friend so that you could call them up and ask them questions.  My question for Ms. Sebold would be: when did you know the muse had touched you?<br />One final note about the naysayers: <br />People who complain about the subject matter simply didn't read the book.  They read the reviews.  The book treats the subject matter with respect and it's not in any way grisly.<br />And folks who complained about it not living up to the hype set their expectations based on marketing.  And no work of art can live up to your expectations if you decide something is going to have to change your life before you open its cover.
0312265859|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Stephanie Plum series and I am always anxious for a new book.  However, this one was a disappointment to me for several reasons:<br />1)  While I liked the storyline, I found the writing very repetitive and annoying.  I don't like the new character, Kloughn, very much.  While he is \\"sweet\\", he is ANNOYING!  <BR>I would have much preferred more Grandma Mazur and Lula escapades, which have always been much funnier.  Also, I would have like more FTA's.  She focused way too much on Bender.<br />2)  I found the humor was not was it usually is.  Usually I laugh out loud at least a few times, this time the humor in the book seemed forced.  <br />3)  Stephanie finally has an encounter with Ranger the Hotty  and it wasn't anything like I expected it would be!  More details or at least HOT EMOTIONS, please!<br />4)  Disappointing that Morelli wasn't in the story much.  He usually makes my heart beat faster too! :) <br />5)  Stephanie is even more incompetent than usual, which was getting old.<br />While I found the book enjoyable, it was mediocre at best.  I hope for a better one next time!

B00003CXB4|5.0|Those people that are saying Lion King was a rip-off of Kimba the Lion are only jaded anime otakus that seem to think American animation is always ripping off Japan.<br />Not true. In fact, The Lion King was an adaption of the famous Shakespearian play Hamlet where the main character(which the play is titled off of)'s father, the King, is killed by his jealous brother. Told by his father's ghost to avenge his death, Hamlet does so, the similarity ends with Disney's trademark happy ending (in Hamlet, everyone dies at the end).<br />This movie, though not my favorite of all the Disney animated features (that title belonging to The Hunchback of Notre Dame), is superbly made and has earned it's recognition as one of the greatest animated features of all time very easily. I'd go as far to say that if Walt were alive when it was released, he would have been proud.<br />The music, acting, animation and overall story are all blended together seamlessly into a movie you have to be completely abnormal not to love.<br />Buy this movie, you won't regret it, even after the upteenth viewing.
6305949980|5.0|I bought this for my son (or that is what I told my wife!).  But I enjoy it far more than he does!<br />I most especially like the earlier work &quot;Vincent&quot; that was included.  Tim Burton showed real talent early on in his career!
B00005QW5X|5.0|Mark my words, in ten years Hedwig will be looked back upon as the best movie of 2001, with a cult following likened only to Rock Horror.  Like most complex movies, Hedwig requires a viewer's patience and an an open mind.  Upon reflection, this movie is really not as edgy as it appears.  It has less to do with gender-bending and more to do with self-acceptance, letting go of the past, the emptiness of revenge, and no longer playing the victim.  These messages are not spoon fed to the viewer by any means and may require multiple viewings to fully grasp.  Beware, this is a raw movie, not a pretty package like Moulin Rouge (which I also enjoyed for different reasons).  The music is intense and meaningful and the acting is brilliant.
0312265859|2.0|Okay, so maybe it's not fair for me to judge this book, seeing as how I'm only on page 60-something -- but I'm a huge Stephanie Plum fan, and already \\"Hard Eight\\" is a major disappointment. I can hardly believe this latest adventure is written by the same Janet Evanovich whose previous books were so hilarious, irreverent, raunchy, and just plain laugh-out-loud wonderful. This honestly reads like some college student in a mystery writing class who's decided, \\"Oh, I can do that\\" -- and can't. The humor (such as it is) is terribly labored (the running gags have officially run out of steam) and the prose is endlessly repetitive, clunky and -- what's most shocking for an Evanovich book -- boooring.  If I finish \\"Hard Eight\\" it will be in the spirit in which Ms. Evanovich seems to have written it: as a not particularly pleasant chore because she had nothing better to do -- or a publisher's deadline.  Only for the most undiscriminating reader.
0515127485|4.0|I confess that I know very little about what actually is going on in Russia today, so I cannot assess whether or not Robert Harris' appraisal of conditions there is accurate.  However, his fictional depiction of the enduring appeal of Stalinism as a possible threat to the (so-called) democratic reforms in Russian society is certainly provocative, and his insights into the internal workings of Stalin's mind and the terrors of his regime make for fascinating reading.<br />There are some sections of the book that drag a bit, but overall, Harris succeeds in creating a slow buildup of tension that keeps the reader turning the pages right up until the final sentence.  His depiction of his characters and of geographical locations is skillful and convincing, and overall, the book is impressively well-written.  For people interested in historical fiction related to Soviet and Russian history, this book definitely makes for a fine \\"summer read.\\"
B000063S6Z|4.0|There's almost no winning when one releases a follow up album to one that was immensely successful.  Moby's &quot;Play&quot; went multiplatinum and that automatically makes folks look at your next work with a microscope.  I too found myself waiting for this album to be a flop as well.  Much to my delight &quot;18&quot; turned out to be anything but a flop.<br />Interestingly though, there are few tracks that immediately stand out.  &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; is anthemic with its rolling bass and rousing chorus.  &quot;In My Heart&quot; seems to borrow from the Philip Glass school of piano playing, very pensive.  Besides a handful of songs, I wasn't too crazy about this album at first.  I decided to listen to it straight through, and the album became much more satisfying as a whole.  Strangely enough, Moby himself recommmends the same thing in the liner notes (which I didn't read until after my little &quot;experiment.&quot;)<br />Tracks like &quot;Fireworks&quot; come off kind of weak by themselves, but ultimately find strength in the context of &quot;18&quot; as a single entity.  They make sense when part of something bigger.  This leads me to think that most groups don't make albums, they release collections of songs.<br />&quot;18&quot; is much more complete than &quot;Play.&quot;  It is good to see artists mix it up, because who wants to pay for the same record in different packaging every couple of years?
0790729628|5.0|Based on a story by Philip K Dick, Blade Runner won acclaim for its gorgeous cinematography and its dark, film noir atmosphere.  It traces Harrison Ford as a cop that is on the trail of murdering human-like robots. The robots are so close to human that they can try to pass themsleves off as human beings.<br />As in most of Philip K Dick's stories, the plot has many layers, twists and turns. The movie expands on the theme and draws you into this world where humanity is not always what it seems. Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer co-star as two of the replicants, trying to stay \\"alive\\" in a world that does not accept them.<br />The original movie came out in 1982, and because the brass in the studio felt it was too complex for theatergoers, things like narrations and a happy ending were added to make it more marketable. In 1993, director Ridley Scott finally got to put out the version he wanted all along, with a more realistic approach. This definitely a movie that you'll enjoy greatly, and be talking about for weeks afterwards. It's the forerunner for popular movies of today including the Matrix and Minority Report.<br />A must-see for any Sci-Fi fan!
B000003CMB|5.0|An outstanding overall album, but \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" is I believe the best single live instrumental track ever recorded. Even those who are classically trained should be able to enjoy the pure emotion and sound musical structure. The interplay between Duane Allman and Dickey Betts shows that sometimes the sum is greater then the parts. The tragedy of Duane's death is reinforced by this great album. It would have been great to hear Duane and Clapton reunite Derek and the Dominoes to see how they had grown over, say twenty or thirty years.
B00006690G|5.0|I love rap. But most of the rap albums I have have only 3 or 4 great songs on it and the rest are okay or just stink. A couple of examples are \\"The Great Depression\\" and \\"Love Is Pain\\". Even Eminem's \\"Stan\\" is not nearly as good as this. Here's my opinion on each of the songs, not including the 3 skits and the \\"skitlike\\" \\"The Kiss\\".<br />#2 White America- 8/10- I love the verses of this song and the chorus is good too, but maybe he could've been a bit quieter on the volume.<br />#3 Business- 10/10- This song is outstanding, and the \\"H*ll Yeah!\\" parts by Dr. Dre are amazing as well. I also like the background tune for the chorus.<br />#4 Cleanin' Out My Closet- 10/10- Although he's pretty mean to his mother at some points of this song, he probably doesn't mean it. But anyway, he actually can sing in this song. I also LOVE the background tune throughout the whole song.<br />#5- Square Dance- 9/10- There are three parts of this song where he really changes his style of singing and puts a likingness into it. That's when he's on \\"...not even on my radar...\\", \\"...oh no I won't leave no...\\", and \\"...gotta take some antibiotic...\\". The chorus is okay.<br />#7- Soldier- 6/10- This song sort of continues out of the violent Kiss. But anyway, the chorus is too boring. It doesn't have much excitement in it. But the verses are good for Eminem's fast singing.<br />#8- Say Goodbye Hollywood- 6/10- Again, the chorus is too boring. But again, the verses are good and the beat of the chorus is good too. <br />#9- Drips- 10/10- This song is SICK!! But Obie's chorus, the main sick part, is pretty good. Why is he saying \\"...[that]...\\"? Anyway, the weird tuned chorus is also awesome and then Eminem's part, too.<br />#10- Without Me- 9/10- The \\"Stan\\" of this album, this song is a big hit and lots of reviewers are using \\"Shady's Back\\" in a way in their title. Eminem adds a huge variety of voices and tunes in this song. And there are also good sound effects. The chorus is catchy.<br />#12- Sing For The Moment- 8/10- The chorus is the only part of this song that I don't really like. And I completely don't understand the \\"Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away part\\", but the verses are pure awesome.<br />#13- Superman- 10/10- One of my favorites, this song has such an awesome opening, 3 stupendous verses, and the outstanding chorus.  You just cannot hate this song.<br />#14- Hallie's Song- 9/10- Eminem puts a tremendous effort into singing into this song, but I'm sorry, it just wasn't enough. But the rapping part towards the end is awesome and so is the chorus.<br />#16- When The Music Stops- 10/10- Although Bizzare's part at the end is ridiculous, different rappers use different ways of singing in this incredible beated song. I know it all by heart, like other songs on this album, but it was the hardest to learn.<br />#17- Say What You Say- 10/10- My top pick on this album. Dr. Dre and Eminem have never sung better before and everything, the background beat, the chorus, the verses, and the switching of rappers is too incredible. I love this song!<br />#18- Till I Collapse- 8/10- Maybe the beat is too hard, but Nate Dogg's chorus is great. Eminem's chorus's are pretty good.<br />#19- My Dad's Gone Crazy- 5/10- So many of my friends love this song, but it just doesn't suit me too well. Hallie's voice is a bit annoying, but when she's talking, it's great. No offense to Eminem. And the rest of the chorus and song is just too uninteresting.<br />So overall, this album is by far Eminem's best. The 3 skits are pretty good, too.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love Britney's 3rd album. Ever since I heard her FIRST ever single \\"Baby One More Time\\" I became a fan of hers. She is creative, and Im surprise that out of all those rumors that people said about her and the way she looks for the cameras, she STILL stands!!!!! That grls got the power. I mean people talk about her and her image. Come on when people, when u hear rumors u just go w/ it, whether or NOT its true. And people say stuff about her that are really personal, so what shes human like no other. Her personal life is her life, and if she does things like go drink in a club it makes her a bad role model to kids, or when she dresses too much over. Its her life, and u dont know anything about her when she is off the cameras and people that will stalk her for pics. and put some headlines on it to make it interesting. All I know is Britney has guts, sing, act and can dance.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lauigne is a new face in music and sure will be around for some time. Her music is a gret mixture of different styles. She as the lyrics of Vanessa Carlton, the music of Michelle Branch, and a brand new voice. It has a pinch of puck rock in it, which you can really hear in &quot;Unwanted&quot;. I love this CD!!
6304584598|4.0|This filmed performance was styled by Nureyev, who choreographed and danced this performance - retaining and only mildly revising the traditional \\"white acts\\" choreography. Nureyev's aim was to give a lot more dancing and character to Prince Siegfried. Apart from his over-the-top makeup, Nureyev's realization of the Prince was, in addition to being the perfection of perfection, profoundly moving - the Prince can act!<br /><br />But there's more. Margot Fonteyn was one of the greatest ballerinas ever. In 1961, when Nureyev famously leapt to the West, a partnership began that many have described as miraculous. Fonteyn's age was fairly transparent here. Certainly the technique maintained a high level of purity and style. Even though the roll was trimmed to accomadate the way of all flesh (Fonteyn was 47 when this was filmed!) and she probably was even more breathtaking at her peak, this performance will not dissapoint anyone but a moron.<br /><br />Sadly, the corps here is weak and the orchestra disappointing. This is why it lost a star from me. Because the corps is so vital to this ballet, and Tchaikovsky's music so fine, you'll probably want another Swan Lake if you can only have one.  But if you're a seeker for heart-melting beauty, you'll have to get it if only for Nureyev.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Being an advocate of the claim that you can find good movies in every film genre, it's always nice to see movies coming out to support my point! The genre of teen movies is considered by many as an easy target for criticism, which of course is not completely unjustified. Nevertheless, films belonging to that genre are not necessarily full of flaws. \\"10 things I hate about you\\" is such an example.<br />I have not read Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" so I cannot say if the script of \\"10 things I hate about you\\" is close to the Bard's original work, from which it was inspired. What I can say though, is that \\"10 things I hate about you\\" is a fresh, witty movie with sharp dialogs and a rather interesting set of characters.<br />The plot: What can you do when your high school love interest is not allowed to go on a date with you, unless her older sister first goes on a date herself? What about becoming an ally with your main rival in order to find a guy capable of dating the older sister? <br />Larisa Oleynik plays Bianca, the pretty, always in fashion but rather shallow, younger sister. Kat (Julia Stiles) is the older sister. She is the one that has to go on a date first, if her younger sister can go out too. The problem is that Kat is unpopular and \\"incapable of human interaction\\".<BR>Bianca immediately catches the attention of Cameron (Joseph-Gordon Levitt), the likable, smart (how else would he be able to learn French so quickly??), and shy, new boy on the block. Cameron with his friend (David Krumholtz, in a role that provides some good moments of laugh) will have to try and persuade the wild and scary Patrick (Heath Ledger), who may not be that wild and scary after all, to go out with Kat. Of course, there is the \\"bad\\" guy, played by Andrew Keegan, who will try to mess things up, just when everything seems to lead to a happy ending.<br />I especially liked the Kat-Patrick couple. Stiles and Ledger definitely have the required chemistry and are able to make us believe how their relationship gradually develops into genuine love.<br />Apart from the main characters, a big asset of the film is the supporting characters, like the English teacher (who makes a habit of throwing Kat out of his class, without any apparent reason) or the sex-obsessed counselor (who tries hard to find fitting words for her new novel...)<br />Overall, \\"10 things I hate about you\\" offers quite a number of moments of genuine laughter, without ever resorting to cheap or crude humor. It is a movie that you will enjoy, if you know what to expect.<BR>One thing though, I have to note as a negative: there were no real extras in the DVD version to completely justify such a purchase.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Pitt and Redford together it happend for the second time.It's great fun to see those actors in this movie.Spy Game has much thriller skills and sometimes my mind goes back to the movie Sneakers.Redford playing the mentor of Pitt, shows he is still able to compete with the younger generation.Pitt's acting grows to a huge level.What made this film great is to see both actors from a different history.

0792151712|4.0|I enjoyed this movie for the special effects and attention to detail.  I must say that I didn't care too much for the romance between Rose and Jack, but I thought Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio gave good performances.  I enjoyed the actual collision with the iceberg and the sinking itself.  The special effects in this movie are first-rate, from the near full size replica of the Titanic herself down to the grand staircase.  Director James Cameron paid great attention to authenticity throughout the movie, including the sinking itself. This attention to detail led to 11 Oscar nominations for the film, as well as a world-wide gross of over 1 billion dollars.  Perhaps the best part of the film was where the Titanic raises up, splits in half, and sinks.  The struggle for survival in the water is accuratley portrayed as well.  I am a history buff, so as I said, I liked the movie for its historical content and accuracy, but the overall plot was only lukewarm.  I felt Rose's character may have been overdone a little.  I got tired of her high society, holier than thou attitude.  I also felt Jack went a little out of his way to impress Rose.  I also enjoyed the beginning scenes where the submarines come upon the wreck itself.  In the end, I liked the movie for the historical content, but I wasn't too high on the rest of it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|No, I'm not talking about him but rather his music. Mayer's music is cute, if that's at all possible. But it's not at all bubble gum. His love songs are filled with words that if your boyfriend said to you, you'd tell all your girlfriends about it for weeks.His lyrics are absolutely beautiful hold the cheese.One by one his songs express emotions to the one you love. Wonderland is a compliment, Stupid Mouth is an apology,Neon is admiration despite faults,Love Song For No One is desire, and St.Patrick's Day is just beautiful.<br />Past his love songs is an album full of songs about life. Most people can relate to atleast one song.My personal favorite is 3x5 which essentially is telling the listener to allow themselves to live. Great Indoors (which touches on the same subject),83 (a narrative nostalgic song),Neon, and No Such Thing are about life plain and simple. There is something in his voice,lyrics, and simplistic guitar that absolutely captivates you. I'm shocked that after months of listening I still get excited listening to this cd.<br />Many people write him off as a shallow copycat musician (for some reason people keep comparing him to Dave Matthews Band.I am telling you as a Dave Matthews Band fan that the two do not compare.Both are good at what they do without doing the same thing.)I challenge those people to get this cd and really listen.This cd has alot of heart and originality.
0425170349|2.0|First, the nits:<br />1. One character has a male calico cat. Male calico cats almost never exist in real life. Knowing his penchant for wordy explanations of every darn thing, one would think that if Clancy knew this, he'd remark on how Dr. Brightling got her rare cat. (genetically engineered him? That would have been cool.)<br />2. A character eats an egg salad sandwich and mentally comments about his companion with a pastrami not being 'vegan'. Vegetarians eat dairy and egg products, while 'vegan' is a term for people who only eat plant-derived foods.<br />It's not too hard to find definitions of the above terms, so why did Clancy misuse 'vegan' for 'vegetarian'? Which leads the astute reader to wonder how much Clancy really knows about the eco-freak organizations he ruthlessly lampoons throughout this book. <br />This is a really lazy effort by a writer who has obvously done everything he can with the genre. Sure, he may know his guns, helicopters, and tanks, but...his characters are cardboard, and I'm pretty sure Clancy has a bunch of cut-and-paste text files he throws in every 20-30 pages just to save on brainpower. All those repetitive, testicle-headed 'musings' by Clark and Ding (retarded nickname, by the way)about being Proud Americans with Razor-Honed Troops and How Great It Is To Command The Very Best Of The Good Guys. I guess this is supposed to convey to the reader how really deep and committed these wonderful soldier/spooks are, but it really just exposes the shallowness of police thinking, and makes me scared to think that there may be real people with guns out there who are equally incapable of coherent non-jingoistic thought.<br />Basically, this book was a moneymaking venture and maybe a bit of a soapbox against environmental extremists, but not really a very good work of fiction.<br />On the plus side, I did read to the very end.  What the heck, even though the characters were all cardboard, Clancy can create some good tension. That's the only thing that raised this story to 2-star status.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|The main problem with this Special Version is OPENING the [darn] PACKET and carefully extracting the Special DVD's!  Great thought - packaging the DVD's along the lines of the old 78 albums of yore - doesn't quite work here - at least not for the serious collector, unless you want to leave it all unopened.  AFTER all of that - there's the question of breaking the seals - do you 'rip' or carefully cut?  Nice idea - does not work!<br />NOW to the movie -  Beckinsale, Affleck and Hartnett are a perfct trio.  A romance along the lines of the great epics circa 1950 - perfectly dove-tailed into the real scenario of WWII.  Punches are not spared and it's true 'in-your face' sometimes gut-wrenching realism.  Very unlike the confusing \\"Black Hawk Down\\"  this one works -  and you care about the characters.<br />Beckinsale well reminds one of a young Kate Hepburn, a superbly modulated performance, Affleck?  Great appeal - flawless talent, and Hartnett?  Untapped, but very promising.<br />Now, try \\"From here to Eternity\\"
B00005RHGK|5.0|at first i saw this as one of the worst movies ever made. never in my entire life was i this scared. well iwatched it with the alternate ending instead of the insanely stupid ending and this gets both my thumbs up. trish and derry are driving on a desolate country road. they havent seen a car for 50 miles and then out of nowhere this truck with a liscense plate that says beatingu shows up and guess whos driving. if you guessed the creeper your right. they see him throw what looks like a body down a sewer pipe. derry goes down to check it out and guess what the creeper seems to be a body collector. this starts off the creepie stuff.just rent it leave your brain on maximum and watch it. you will love it just like i did.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|Even the always stellar GUY PEARCE cannot save this catastrophe - Pity! The premise is fair - a misguided love-story, marred by tragedy - with a faint possibility of 'righting' it all - NOT!<br />Mr. Pearce is our new traveller [previously Rod Taylor also fellow 'Oz'] but it's silly to compare the Great George Pal version to this one - although it would have been delicious fun for Guy Pearce to discover Mr. Taylor and Ms. Mimieux of the original version happily settled 'somewhere in time' ....<br />This one gets bogged down once we reach the future - Great art direction / sets, etc. costumes are OK ish, but very unlike the Eloi considering their limited resources. AND yes we do find the obligatory remnants of New York ala \\"Planet of the Apes\\" - Pal's version had more 'dread' - relics of the distant future found in the 'distant-distant' future - there we really had the feeling of \\"WHAT went wrong ......?\\" [We don't quite find out - which adds to the dread].<br />Special effects are OK - the time machine resembles two lighthouse beacons welded together by lasar - standard fare. The dreaded Morlocks? Not! [Just a 'pinch' of \\"The Mole People\\" here ...]<br />Soundtrack - strangely Polynesian ....<br />The strangest kick? Jeremy Irons as a Samurai-dominatrix - now that's something to behold!<br />Better fare? The George Pal original also \\"Time After Time\\".
B000001I0K|5.0|You get the true essence of The Cramps with this jewel.  The Cramps are like the cockroaches of Rock-n-Roll....primitive and perfect.  You can listen to them on a tape recorder made in 1985 and they still sound great.  Do tunes get any better than &quot;Human Fly&quot;??  Buy this, you won't regret it.  The Big Guy downstairs has a soft spot for The Cramps and so should you.
0393312836|5.0|I have tried to write a review of this book at least ten times, but I can never seem to find the right way to describe it. This is mainly because I consider A Clockwork Orange to be one of the most painful, brilliant, and disturbing stories ever to be put down on paper. The invented slang used by Alex and his \\"droogs\\" is one of the best parts of the book. You'd think that the slang would make it confusing to read, but it doesn't! In fact, it's strangely catchy. They call it \\"nadsat\\" and it's a kind of Russified English. And I don't even speak Russian. (Burgess later invented \\"caveman speak\\" in Quest For Fire.) <br />The basic plot follows Alex and his gang of sadistic young punks as they run amok, beating, raping, and murdering with gleeful abandon in the London of the near-future. They then retire to a bar to drink drug-enhanced milk and plot their next crime. Eventually, Alex gets caught and is subjected to the will of the State. He's forcibly deprogrammed with the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" in which he's strapped to a chair, his eyelids held open by metal clamps, and forced to watch a long movie of non-stop murder, rape, torture, and other horrible violence until he gets physically ill at the mere thought of such acts. Then he is thrown back on the streets, a declawed kitten at the mercy of his former victims. The American re-edition is published with the controversial twenty-first chapter not included in Kubrick's film, plus an introduction by the author called \\"A Clockwork Orange Resucked.\\"<br />Unfortunately, it's a sad reflection on society in that Alex was shunned because of his violence, and when caught, had violence inflicted on him in order to make him stop. This extremely graphic novel received mixed reactions, either hailed as genius or dismissed as violent pornography. I would recommend the movie as well; it's visually inventive and a must-see from one of the world's greatest directors.
B000001DTM|5.0|I didn't really understand this album at first but with about a month of listening to the songs over and over I could relate to the meanings and they were powerful. Since how this was the first U2 album I've heard of I cant really relate to any other CD's as other people say they are mainly about politics, I dont know. My personal favorite track on this album was ULTRAVIOLET (LIGHT MY WAY) simply because I believe it is the most powerful song in the whole album. The love and passion and strong lyrics like: \\"There is a silence that comes to a house where no one can sleep, i guess its the price of love, I know it's not cheap.\\" I also love the song \\"Love Is Blindness\\" \\"Acrobat\\" and \\"The Fly\\" which arent quite as powerful as \\"Ultraviolet\\" (My opinion) but are still strong enough to compare. The strong and powerful and high tone of Bono's lyrics makes the song just more powerful (and not to mention that great instrumentals by The Edge, Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton). Perhaps listening to the songs like \\"Ultraviolet\\" or \\"Love IS Blindness\\" may make you burst out in tears simply because they are just that strong and powerful. What am I running my mouth about, buy the CD, you'll love it!
B000067CQK|2.0|...All of the material could have easily been fit onto<BR>one disc and the packaging is shoddy.  This album, in its original for or the RYKO release, are a must for any serious <BR>music listener, which is why I gave it two stars.
B000001FSR|5.0|I first heard this back in college. At the time, it blew away antything else I was hearing & I think it single handedly changed my tastes in music. 15 years later I never tire of it. Which is probably why I'm writing this review.<br /><br />Critics would have you believe this is the third installment of a trilogy that started with SWORDFISHTROMBONES. If anything, it stands as a precursor to the work he later did with Robert Wilson. This album is the music from a performance piece Waits wrote with his wife & collaborator, Kathleen Brennan. It played to sold out performances at the Steppenwolf Theatre in the mid 80's & if I had known who the hell Tom Waits was then, I'd certainly be in the 1st row.<br /><br />\\"Hang On St. Christopher\\" comes off as a reckless itinerary for a fugitive of justice.  The sparse use of horns coupled with Mark Ribot's signature guitar aid & abet for a long day's journey into night.<br /><br />\\"Temptation\\" has to be one of my favorite Waits'tunes featuring a demented falsetto & chorus as seductive as the subject matter. If Stephen Foster wrote a song based off William Kennedy's IRONWEED, it might have sounded like \\"Innocent When You Dream\\". An undeiable classic, right up there with the likes of \\"Time \\" & \\"Tom Traubert's Blues\\".<br /><br />Without a doubt, there's a pervading sense of gloom overiding this album but every song is a gem if you take the time to dust it off. From the drunken \\"RAWHIDE\\" trappings of \\"Yesterday Is Here\\" to the delerious Film Noir of \\"Telephone Call From Instanbul\\" , this album is a virtual mugshot of Waits at his height of his powers. If anyone could write a musical of Eugene O'Neill's ICEMAN COMETH, it's Tom Waits. And I have to say, FRANK'S WILD YEARS is the sonic equivalent. Its certainly one of the most ambitious records of his career. A roadtrip movie for the damned.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This is certainly an extraordinary piece of work.  The animation is superb, with some very beautiful effects and tableaux that will take your breath away.  The action scenes are also very well done, and are frequently riveting.  This is a real film, not a kiddie cartoon; and it takes advantage of the potential of its medium like few things this viewer has ever seen before.<br />The impact of the film is limited however by poor development of the plot -- it's not that convoluted, it's just inadequately presented -- which makes it essentially impossible to follow.  And some of the characters' voices are so quietly and murkily recorded that you simply can't make them out.  It's unfortunate, because it really mars the movie.<br />Having said that this is a unique achievement that certainly bears watching at least once.
0380820846|3.0|After reading the reviews on this book I had to comment. I think that Julia spent way too much time on Lady Whistledown, and not enough on the ROMANCE between Colin and Penelope. I waited patiently for this book, and only gave it three stars because it's a Quinn. Because unrequited love is something most of us can identify with, we want more than just &quot;the wedding was magical-and the wedding night-well, that was magical,too&quot; (page 298)We want DETAILS, Julia! Where's the ROMANCE?? How could you gloss over such an important part of the story-the culmination of Penelope's infatuation of many years? I hope that Eloise's story is more like the Quinn I know and love.
B00005Q66T|4.0|Like THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION, this compilation collects her biggest hits of the past 10 years onto one disc, and while it is very good, there are flaws - such as the single edit versions instead of the album versions, and so many hits and good album tracks that were left off (&quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;, &quot;I'll Remember&quot;, &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, &quot;Time Stood Still&quot; - which wasn't a hit but was a very good but overlooked track from THE NEXT BEST THING soundtrack - &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;) Anyway, what Madonna needs is a six disc boxed set (4 CD's/2 DVD's) that collects every hit single, choice album cuts, soundtrack songs, remixes, and for the DVD's, every single music video that she's ever done in her 20-year career into one nice and tidy package.

0312265859|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy this series.  I'm just finding the predictability of Stephanie's misadventures to be a little tiresome.  You KNOW there will be an exploding car or two.  You KNOW that Stephanie will shoot herself in the foot, or lose another dozen pair of handcuffs, or destroy any number of favorite articles of clothing, or be scared out of her wits by some really evil wrongdoer and have to move in with either Morelli or her parents.  And the list goes on and on.<br />I wanted to love this book.  I wanted to love the last 2-3 entries in the series.  They mostly just left me wanting more, and wondering why I'm still reading them.<br />Maybe Janet could take a break from Stephanie Plum and write a book or two about Ranger's exploits in the meantime?  Ranger is a fascinating character.  Who wouldn't want to know more about the infamous man of mystery?<br />All in all, if you've followed the series, the book is probably worth reading.  Just be aware that you've heard most of it before.
0790751216|5.0|You might be tempted for thinking that a theme as routinely mythic as the lone gunman saving a town would make for some fairly predictable stuff, but Pale Rider defies the odds and achieves a wholly new level in the genre. This is partly due to the extreme simplicity of the plot (Mining tyrant attempts a ruthless eviction of honest settlers), the astonishing scenery, but mainly a result of Eastwood's gritty, monosyllabic anti-hero, who by the end of the film seems completely enigmatic, genuinely mythic. The film draws on the old Kurosawa themes so richly plundered in 'The Magnificent Seven' and other films of the like, but this is finally a simple, age-old tale, beautifully filmed and a perfectly executed tour-de-force. It's better, even, than 'Unforgiven' and that's saying something.
0517543052|4.0|I really enjoyed it. The Eastern path is not really where I am at, but found this book  inspiring nevertheless. I really enjoyed the initial autobiographic part, as Ram dass is such an interesting man and has had such an interesting life. The journey of transformation of Richard Alpert into Ram Dass, the psychedelic experiences, the frienship with Timothy Leary and the encounter with the guru had me spellbound.<br />Also, the next part of the book is so original in presentation, a real experiment in writing and art and of communication through the sensory experinece. It has that whole seventies feel about it. A classic.  And much ageless wisdom in here.
6303471714|5.0|If you want to work then get this video! It is the most effective workout that I have ever done that is not mostly cardio. Don't get me wrong, your heartrate will get up there, however, you are not jumping around the whole time. In fact, the cardio sections are probably the easiest part. The only people I know that ever complained about this video are ones that aren't ready to REALLY WORK IT!
B0000041Q3|5.0|I have to agree with the reviewer below.  If you get this recording for one reason only, you have to get it for the final note of Monserrat Caballe's &#34;Signore Ascolta.&#34;  I don't think I have ever heard a more beautiful sound produced by a human voice.<br /><br />Of course you get much more than this!  A fabulous Luciano in full voice (as always) and a powerful, almost alien sounding Empress in Sutherland.  The orchestra and chorus move like a great, powerful and sinewy chinese dragon and provide wonderful support and there is fine ensemble work from Ping, Pang and Pong.<br /><br />From the opening declamatory chords to the final triumphant cadence, the whole thing just melts into one long beautiful orgasm of voices, music and drama.
B000068QY7|4.0|While the sound of Heathen Chemistry is obviously that of Oasis, something has changed. Gone is the lager lad attitude of Definetly Maybe and Whats The Story, gone is the charlie addled hyperbole of Be Here Now and gone is the un-certainty of Giants. Noel has said that this could be viewed as the &quot;new&quot; oasis's debut album and he's not wrong. While their is still the big rock sound on songs like Hindu Times, their also seems to be a more thoughful and sensitive side appering in Oasis's music which is good to see. some critics might reckon that they are rippng the beatles style off for all it's worth, but if any band can be compared to being as good as the beatles then maybe it's Oasis and who cares if they sound a bit like the beatles, because the beatles were the best. Heathen Chemistry proberly wont win any new fans and may even dissapoint some of the old fans who liked to view Oasis as music u would listen to as you try to drink as many pints as possible on a friday night at the pub. over all heathen times is a masive step forward for oasis.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|Oh my, I can see the appeal this movie has on young girls. Its got everything---and it almost looks like it was set up for them as an audience. Ugh. As an adult....eeew. I found this movie hard to sit through. I was disappointed that all the songs seemed to be taken from other sources. No originals---would we put up with an original musical, however, nowadays? Yes, the whole movie is eyecandy, the story is the sappy story of love and all that and the obstacles against them. Sweet story. Yes yes. And the whole dying scene was overdone, overplayed. It was just---too romantic for me? Dare I say that? I just wasn't impressed. I guess I didn't get it. Satine's name even looks like its spelled wrong.<BR>The whole premise: a bohemian dude shows up at the Moulin Rouge and falls for the courtesan, Satine ie Nicole Kidman. Always gorgeous yet cold. He has never fallen in love. Boo hoo. Well, they fall in love. But the duke! He must have her! The evil duke must have whats mine! The young lovers meet behind the dukes back, tee hee. Then the scenario builds to its finale, Satine is dying, oh the drama! If you are between the ages of 7-27, I believe you'll love this movie. Don't get me wrong, I cried in the end too, but boy was I glad it was over! Yeehaw!
6305609705|5.0|This is one of the few films that I would classify as not just an amazing motion picture but great art as well.A film you don't watch but experience.
0671004107|4.0|The performances are excellent and the scenes memorable. Though  the filmed version lacks the key points in Sagan's novel,  Contact is one of the most realistic science fiction films ever produced with many real newscasters (almost too many, at times)lending their hands.  Aside from its special effects and mysteries revealed, Contact presents a very believable story of<BR>worldwide reactions to the discovery of life beyond.  <br />I strongly recommend the novel to anyone interested in this topic.   Reading the book is well worth the time.
B000068QKT|5.0|With a delightfully playful exterior and subtle inner wisdom, Amélie reveals a world within the world of our perceptions, where not everything absolutely must be as it seems, if only you take a moment to peel away the surface layers of life&#8217;s hidden fruits and let the pulp rain in droplets onto your tongue. <br />A magical composition of stories within a story, Amélie challenges us through gentle suggestion and colorful detail to think past the ordinary, to see the world through our mind&#8217;s eye and, as Amelie does herself, to notice the things nobody else does. Vibrant, fascinating and compelling characters encourage us to see past the outer weave of personality and peek inside, where everyone has a little lost soul inside, waiting to be appreciated. <br />Most of all, perhaps, this story reminds us that a world of inspiration is often as close as our own backyard.
0451191153|5.0|Ayn Rand's fascinating and complex characters and her insight into American society are what make \\"The Fountainhead\\" such a powerful classic.   Though it contains some out-dated themes, the timeless story of one man's vision and integrity in the face of impossible obstacles is still profound and enjoyable over a half a century after it was written.     <br />Ayn Rand's descriptions are mesmerizing but she is never much of a romantic. The love story angle is weaker here than in \\"Atlas Shrugged\\".   While Dominique may seem unrealistic and difficult to identify, the story's main character, the unbendable, unbreakable Howard Roark, will always remain one of the most memorable in American literature. <br />There is an interesting side note about this novel-- Rand's inspiration for Roark, Frank Lloyd Wright, refused to ever meet the famous author despite several attempts on her part, a typically Howard Roark thing to do.
0783226837|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies because it is so darn funny.<BR>For those that generally shun horror movies give this one a look it's really not that horrible. For one thing you really only see the monsters now and then though you hear them and see the results of them burrowing around after people.<br />I generally shy away from depicting scenes in reviews too often but here is an example of one time the monsters make an appearance. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire play a survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer. They are in their basement breaking out the guns from the gun cabinet when one of the monsters bursts in upon them. While this is going on Kevin Bacon and the others are listening to the fight over the radio from a rooftop and a ferocious gun battle ensues. Long story short the monsters loose that match up.<br />After they kill the creature one of the guys hold out on the roof turns to the other and says \\"Well I guess we can't make fun of Burt's lifestyle no more\\".<br />Anyways that's just one scene so I haven't given much away to be honest but it's really a much more amusing than a scary movie and I recommend it.
B000067G3C|2.0|It starts out with good potential, but then becomes far fetched - to say the least.  They defy the laws of physics - there's no way a bus would make a jump like that.  In fact no vehicle can jump from a flat surface with no type of ramping.  And can a bus take those corners at 50 or greater without tipping.  I think not.  <br />They should've let the lady in the elevator in the beginning die, or at least loose her legs for hesitating so long.<br />If you can overlook such ridiculous scenes, then the movie isn't half bad.  It's worth seeing, but not worth owning.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Ok first off I could see where this wouldn't necesarily be appropriate for the below 8 yars of age crowd perhaps but for the most part this movie is not scary.  Funny yes scary nope.<br />If you are tired of all the blah, blah, same, same, videos out there here is something you could certainly call different...<br />The premise of the movie is basically this.  The tradition of clowns goes back pretty far in time to the last time the klowns dropped by.  It is the fascination with the deadly visitors from ages past that has led to the modern circus clown.<br />Now they are back and look out they have the full bag of tricks and you will see where the human clowns got the inspiration for their stuff.  I'm not going to detail all the bits of the movie but make no mistake the klowns are evil evil beings.....<br />This is actually a movie that you will be able to watch with your friends more than once and still enjoy because it is so goofy.  It's all a real conversation piece to borrow out at work and school.

B000067CPX|4.0|I bought this album hoping for an album much like Californication, but upon first hearing the second track, i knew it wasnt gonna be the same.  However, this album is still a must have for a RHCP fan.  The next day i found myself humming the tunes and quoting various phrases from a lot of songs on this album and i havnt gone a day wihtout listening to this album at least twice through.  I found a lot of songs just drift you away such as the guitar in \\"Dosed\\", and the intro to \\"Cabron\\" which is sooo sweet. The only song i skip is \\"Throw away your television\\" which is still an alright song.  \\"Cant Stop\\", \\"On Mercury\\", \\"This is the Place\\", \\"I Could die for you\\"  and \\"Monor Thing\\" are the kinda songs u hear once and already like it.  I fell in love with it the second time i heard it and cant go a day without hearing it and am already anxiously awaiting to hear what they come out with next and as well as to which songs will have videos.

Sorta like the \\"Beatle\\" ban of the 1960's after John Lennon commented on Jesus. Maybe you can run to every naked statue and help government officials to cover up the ... art portion.<br />For the rest of you, or those that actually have a mind, listen up. Pay attention to the music and the lyrics. Relax, laugh, have fun and please, pay attention to what is real and what isn't. You can decide what is and what isn't...if you can't, then you're not old enough to have this album. Let's see...<br />1. Curtain's Up - Wow...what a powerful intro! So similar to: Public Service Announcement...didn't someone refer to this album being the same old formula?<br />2. White America - Heavy lyrics and not for the Bible devout. Well, he's spitting a lot of truth in a ram it down your throat style here.<br />3. Business - Assuming this is the second single, it's a smack at himself, a play-off on fantasy, and spit at the wannabe copycats.<br />4. Cleanin Out My Closet - Slowed down chorus sealing together a certifiable slam at his mother and himself. Humor...get one people...haha.<br />5. Square Dance - Don't tell the government about this one. You might rethink signing up for military service, because he's right.<br />-Gonna drop down to #10 - Without Me - along the same lines as The Real Slim Shady...better.<br />Enough breaking the album down track by track - well, Curtains Close is a freaky little exit. All in all, Eminem has departed from Slim Shady & Marshall Mathers LP's. Formula...I think this is a more mature look...not formula. Of course, he's going to have similarities to Eminem and Eminem's style...because he is Eminem...[M]arshall [M]athers...get it? Good. Seems to me that Elton John, Coolio, Green Day all share that same trait...wonder why...hmmm. Overall, this is a heavy album twisting in new directions...not formula.

B00000JCB2|1.0|Which reviewer said Wes Borland is like a modern day Jimmy Page? Dude, have you ever played a guitar in your life? Wes Borland is the biggest Poser I've ever heard, I don't hear anything distinctive in his guitar sound (so what if it's a 7 string? can he play anything on it?)and it is an insult to people who know what good guitar is (and the many players that don't get recognition that have real TECHNIQUE)that people respect Wes' playing and look at him like some guitar god. Wes is the de-evolution of modern rock guitar. Funnily enough, Wes left Limp Bizkit after the next album because he listens to Radiohead and thinks he is capable of writing artrock and finally getting good reviews. I'll give him credit for leaving a popular band, but not for much else.<br />Also, a lot of people go on and on about Fred Dursts this or that, but I'll just get right to the point, the man can not rap or sing worth a damn! His rhymes are terrible, I mean LL Cool J has better flow than Fred Durst and his lyrics really are trite and cliche' ridden.<br />Limp Bizkit is totally devoid of musicianship. I can see how some people would be into it, but honestly, a lot of bands do what Limp does way better.
B000002UDG|5.0|\\"Wingspan\\" has rendered this album almost moot. Still, this album is good in its own right. \\"All the Best\\" follows a selection of McCartney songs and a few B-sides from the Wings years and solo days. If you're not an avid McCartney fan, or just a hits-lover, this one is for you. At the time of its release, it captured the magic of his career, however, since his recent compilation, it would be good to see alternative songs and a re-release. \\"Wings Greatest\\" is another, the first, compilation of McCartney's work, that was rendered moot by \\"Wingspan.\\"&lt;P...
B00006690G|1.0|You don't even have to own this CD to know that it is an insult to all that is music.  I listened to a few of the tracks from a friend who owns the CD, and after my taste of Eminem's \\"finest work\\"  I must wonder how this person ever got a record contract in the first place.  It's sad to see that someone writing this terrible of \\"music\\" is getting this much popularity, and even sadder to see that people think that his violent, degrading lyrics have some type of \\"deep\\" meaning that people should really listen to for the valuable message that Eminem sends us all.  ....n that we all knew was coming on &quot;The Kiss&quot; where he reinacts his violent run-in with his wife kissing another guy.<br />Eminem gets back to the pop status of song's like &quot;My Name Is&quot; and &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; with the catchy and upbeat &quot;Without Me&quot; where he continues to diss such artists as Chris Capatrick of &quot;NSYNC, Limp Bizkit all together, and Moby. Then, the personal and conscience bubble explodes on the self-defining track &quot;Hailie's Song&quot; where he raps about how he's crazy until he looks in his daughters eyes.<br />And basically, the rest of the album is just a personal, self-consience mess on songs like &quot;Sing For The Moment&quot; and &quot;'Till I Collapse&quot;.<br />My overall opion of &quot;The Eminem Show&quot; is that he could've done better, but it's not a complete failure, and i give it an overall<BR>of four stars for trying.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Depending on whom you ask, legendary director Robert Altman is either a fool or a genius.  His fifty year career includes prominence in the early days of TV with his direction of dozens of hit series such as \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\", \\"Maverick\\", and \\"Bonanza\\".   His filmmaking credits include \\"M.A.S.H.\\" and \\"The Player\\", both critically acclaimed.  His mercurial style of filmmaking is probably a rebellion from the highly structured approach imposed upon him by early TV.  <br />The direction of his recent films can only be described as chaotic, with a cacophony of actors speaking over one another, and moving hither and yon as the camera sweeps from one side of the room to the other attempting to home in on the dialogue of particular characters.  Altman himself admits that he doesn't even read the script and really isn't concerned with what the actors say, as long as things sound right to him when they come out of their mouths.  He encourages ad-libbing and the more disordered the scene, the better he generally likes it.  Often, this produces utter disasters, like \\"Dr. T and the Women\\" and \\"Gun\\".  Sometimes it produces a gem like \\"Gosford Park\\".<br />As a murder mystery, Gosford Park is not all that special.  It is fairly predictable with obvious hints dropped at every turn as to who did it and why.  As is the case in most of Altman's recent films, it is difficult to make out a lot of the dialogue with the din on the soundstage of everyone talking at once.  However, what makes this film unique is the treatment of the human dynamic between the aristocracy and the servants.  While lampooning the wealthy by contrasting their behavior with the simple wisdom of commoners is nothing new, never has it been done with such depth and nuance.  Altman's flowing direction of simultaneous events is probably the only way this could have been accomplished so effectively. <br />The all-star ensemble cast is superlative.  Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam all give fabulous performances upstairs, and Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson and Alan Bates are marvelous downstairs.  For film lovers who enjoy good acting, this film is paradise.<br />Genius or fool?  Who knows, maybe both.  However for Robert Altman, this film is clearly a winner.  I rated it 9/10.

I'm going to name names here, and if you don't like it, go back to your Britney Spears drivel, 'cause THAT'S what 99% of the music industry is sludging out nowadays. Everybody else \\"plays homage\\" to their heroes; Oasis is accused of stealing. What gives? I don't see Noel Gallagher in court for plagiarizing--like George Harrison was. What makes the Beatles so ...special that nobody is allowed to emmulate them? John Lennon himself would be the first to tell you the Beatles aren't sacred cows--and I say it rules that there's somebody out there who CAN sing like John Lennon. Basically put, there's nothing new under the sun, but much of the time, that's a good thing. 4/4 Rock-n-roll is 4/4 rock-n-roll, and nobody but Alex van Halen can pace a song in 7/8 time. Oasis produces HONEST top-notch rock-n-roll, and their records are chuck-full of great songs--not one or two singles and the rest of the CD being junk. Noel Gallagher has the best understanding of the Wall of Sound concept since Phil Specter, and his voice has never sounded better than on \\"Little by Little\\". Baby brother Liam is more than a match for the magnificent \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\", and he is maturing into a fine songwriter in his own right. The same people whining that Oasis wrote their best songs in a haze of polysubstance abuse probably say the same thing about Eric Clapton and Aerosmith. Me, I prefer Our Lads to be healthy and happy--keep it up, mates! All of Oasis's CD's and DVD's kick it, and it just keeps getting better with \\"Heathen Chemistry\\". Hands down, the BEST CD of the year! Sissies, shut up about Oasis and go back to poking steak knives in your ears with Destiny Child's latest release--Oasisites know the real score. LIVE FOREVER, NOEL AND LIAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0345363132|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman writes a wonderful historical fiction book.  Her books are long and complex and the research that goes into the making of each one is tremendous.  I have personally learned a lot about English history (especially about the Aquitane era) from reading her many wonderful books.
B000003NA4|5.0|I must say I am quite confused at the range of opinions in the reviews here.  There's the \\"big fan\\" contingent, and the \\"where's the beef?\\" contingent.  I am one of the former.<br />Diana Krall is one of the best things to happen to the jazz scene in the last decade.  Her claim to fame is her sultry alto, but she is also quite adept at the piano.  Those reviews here who complain about the lack of emotional range don't get that one of her main attractions is subtlety.  She doesn't hit you over the head.  She seduces you.  If there is a more sexy, satin-sheets, wine-on-ice rendition of *anything* that beats her \\"Peel Me a Grape\\", I haven't heard it.<br />Obviously, this recording contains love songs, or more properly, songs about love.  Many are slow and sensual, and a few are more up-tempo -- but even those are understated.  I think her interpretations are exactly what she was aiming for.  It's not a rap against her if she's intentionally keeping the temperature just warm enough to simmer.  She's not trying to boil.  I don't think it's a coincidence that there is no drummer around.<br />The renditions here are delightful, although some more than others.  (I can't quite get in to \\"I Miss You So\\" or \\"Garden in the Rain\\".)  But \\"All or Nothing at All\\", \\"Peel Me a Grape\\", and \\"My Love Is\\" are worth the price of admission.
B00005UW7V|4.0|Artificial Intelligence is definetely an extraordinary film, the one and only problem with the movie is that it can be confusing at times. Other than that I believe it to be one of the most unique films I've ever seen. The structure is magnificent and Haley Joel Osment portrays his character as an artificially created &quot;boy&quot; with feel and genuine passion. I would recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys sci-fi settings and a strange but fascinating plot. It's a masterpiece.
B000066NW0|5.0|avril has an awesome voice...usally i dont like this kind of music but i love this cd! its so gr8! u dont hear a vocie like this in a long time! she is raw talent! ...avril is PURE! she rocks..buy the cd...enough sed!
B000059ZLH|2.0|I bought this with great expectations but was dissapointed. All myopic DT fans will avoid this review, but this DVD ... The sound should be in 5.1, and loud! The volume level is very, very low. I can't believe anyone listened to this before releasing it. Also the video has way to much \\"cinematic\\" scenes. Just give a DVD showing this great band playing LOUD, and in 5.1!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|If you are human, you will not buy this album(or any other Beatles record). You want to hear real Beatles, find some vinyl at a used record store, burn a friend's copy, or at the very worst, dowload it from your favorite audio service.<br />Think of it this way, every album of this you buy, Michael Jackson gets one step closer to another facelift, another 100 hundred acres of land, and a new activity center for Bubbles. The absolute worst, it give him chance to make new album. Can your conscience bare that kind of misery. I know I can't. Thank God I work at the library. So much easier burn copies that way.
0151008116|5.0|Destined to be a classic.  One suggestion: Read it before you read the reviews.  Too much of the story is given away.

B000003TAW|5.0|I have only recently in the past few months, and this was the second album of theirs that I bought after The Green Album, and although that one is very could...it's somewhat very short, on the other hand The Blue Album is the right length, and is a beautiful peace of work and although I like the whole album their are a few songs that are highlights for me, like My Name Is Jonas, The World Has Turned And Left Me Here, Buddy Holly, Undone-The Sweater Song, Say It Ain't So and Only In Dreams
B00005OMTT|5.0|All of Enigma's best songs all rolled onto this masterpiece....A must have for all Enigma fans
B00004XMTH|5.0|i am the biggest cats fan there is. i have watched it atleast 100 times, including last night. my whole family loves it, and we watch it when we are bored. my absolute favorite is jacob brent, (misto), he is soooooooo hot and he is the best dancer alive. my friends think i am nuts, but i told them to watch it,and they fimally gave in and said it was the best they have ever seen!!! my only disapointment is that i never got to see it live. i was going to see it live, but my mom got lazy and forgot to buy the tickets. but i made my self feel better by watching the video again. i recomend it to everyone, it is an all ages film, and you will have the best time ever!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JKLZ|4.0|althouth this is pretty loosely based on the original it is still a decent movie.<BR>Guy pearce is always watchable, and Jeremy Irons falls into the category of the most evil villians ever.<BR>the rest of the cast seems kind of weak,but hey! Samantha Mumba wears a see-through mesh tank top! so thats at least worth seeing.<BR>all in al it's a good movie and worth owning.
B000066C6Z|5.0|I am shocked to see so many regarding this movie so high. I thought for the general public, it was too slapstick and crude. To me, it is one of, if not the funniest comedies i've ever seen. This is one of the only movies where I laugh out loud when i'm alone. <BR>    <BR>This movie pulls no punches. It is absolutely silly and the characters are'nt afraid to say it. Who can forget the hero's: Escargot, Souffle, Detante, Avant Guard, Croissant, De ja Vu, Latrine, Chevalier, and Chocolate Mousse to name a few? A man who get's killed for dog biscuits? A manager who get's impaled upon a large mechanical device? A spy who survives in a compacted car? An unbreakable window at the Potato Farm?<BR>    <BR>Yes folks, it all happens and more. If you enjoyed the Zucker brothers films, then you'll enjoy Top Secret. One of the pioneer movies that changed the face of comedy.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|In this interesting, entertaining film, director Ron Howard has assembled an all star cast to tell the tragic story of Princeton mathematician John Nash.  Russell Crowe's Nash is a quirky, mathematical genius, complete with the touchy sense of forlorn pride that comes with doing only one thing extremely well.  He sees arcane patterns everwhere, all the time, like a chess grandmaster who has come to inadvertently inhabit his chessboard.  His life is an intellectually exciting one... but how much of it is actually real?  He cannot tell.  Can you?<br />This movie really needs to be seen twice, or more.  There's no way you'll appreciate everything the first time around.  The character's &quot;journey,&quot; for which Ron Howard and Russell Crowe seem to have been shooting, is Nash's growth, both because of and despite his schizophrenia, from an arrogant, cold &quot;genius&quot; to a warmer, less standoffish human being.  It is interesting to see his receptivity to the people around him increase, even as his attention to his inner hallucinations decreases.  The inverse relationship between these qualities is somehing to behold, and to ponder.<br />I would like to take this opportunity to call your attention to an interesting casting decision.  Did you happen to experience a mild sense of deja vu, when watching Nash's lab assistants work together at MIT's Wheeler labs?  Or when we first meet them, in the film's opening scenes?  If you happened to catch &quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; back in 1993, that explains the feeling.  The characters Bender and Sol are played by Anthony Rapp and Adam Goldberg, who played a very similar couple of buddies in &quot;Dazed and Confused.&quot;  There, they were Tony and Mike, &quot;the smart kids&quot; in their wild Texas high school.  Here again, together they portray an unusually intelligent pair, coping with varying success with the mundane world.  Just an interesting thing to note....  Other more-or-less background characters look like they had a lot of fun playing their parts, as well, especially Ed Harris and Paul Bettany.<br />A problem I have is the way that &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; glosses quickly over some things, to make a person's life into fit material for a 90 minute film.  Think about it.  The happy times that John Nash enjoyed with his wife Alicia (fantastically played by the brilliant/babe-acious Jennifer Connelly) seem to amount to a few months, tops.  It appears that virtually their entire life together, from their early 20s to their late 60s, were almost constantly miserable.  Somehow the film makes you fel that there is a grand human triumph in here somewhere, but I'm not sure I agree.  Nash's is certainly a fascinating life story, but the film ranks a little too high on the well-known &quot;S.S.I.&quot; -- the Schmidt Schmaltz Index.<br />I have nothing but respect for Ron Howard, who is plainly a good man, a good guy, and an EXCELLENT director.  Therefore, I imagine that he probably felt it was worth telling this story in a somewhat overly &quot;Hollywood&quot; fashion, in order to draw all the more attention to the important topics dealt with herein.  Nevertheless, I just want to note that this movie is pretty simplistic in certain ways, and achieves its emotional punch at a certain cost in terms of its faith to the real story.  If you want a more complete version of this story, try Sylvia Nasar's book version, also entitled &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  If you don't want to concern yourself too much with reality, but just love this kind of story, I'd like to recommend that you read Daniel Keyes' &quot;Flowers for Algernon.&quot;
B000060P79|5.0|Oh my God this is such a great cd! It's one of those cd's where you don't skip any songs because each song is good and you want to hear them all. I'm addicted to it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The first time you watch this movie you think to yourself, &quot;man that was great, but what did I just watch.&quot;  The second time you watch it you think, &quot;wow, what an amazing movie, but I still don't know everything that's going on.&quot;  And the fact that you don't know everything will keep you watching this one over and over.  And the more times you watch this, the better it gets.  An amazing film from start to finish, or should I say from finish to start?
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall was the first Floyd album where the lyrical concept overshadowed the music, and for that reason, it pales in comparison to Dark Side and Animals (both of which are a perfect balance of lyrical and musical genius).  Nonetheless, this is still an incredible album.  A rock opera in the truest sense of the word, this is an album that has been both helped and hurt by its popularity.  The incessant airplay of songs like Another Brick in the Wall Part 2, Comfortably Numb, Run Like Hell, Hey You, and Young Lust can make the listener unfamiliar to the entire album believe that this album is about the songs instead of the story.  That is why there are so many people who finally go out and buy the album and are dissapointed in the fact that it isn't 26 Comfortably Numbs that make up the album.  Some call the shorter, less popular songs &quot;filler&quot;.  Those who do are missing the point of the album as a whole.  This is not your average CD that you throw in your car to listen to on the way down to the grocery store.  The Wall needs to be heard, felt, and absorbed as a whole.  It is more like a book on CD with backing music.  Although the soundscapes that back the main theme are a perfect fit, and the music is melodic, complicated, emotional, and energetic, it is there mainly to help convey the emotion that is stated in the lyrics.  The short &quot;filler&quot; is neccesary to bridge the different subject matters together and move the album from one theme to the other.  Lets put it this way, this album is actually built like a brick wall.  The bricks make up the most important part, but the wall would collapse without the cement &quot;filler&quot; that binds it together.  <br />If you aren't willing to sit down and listen to the whole album, it will probably go right over your head.  But if you do take the time to sit and get emotionally involved, it can be a rewarding, albeit a bit depressing, experience.  This isn't Floyd's best music(not that its bad, they justhave done better), but it is one of the best lyrical concepts ever written, and well worth the while for that alone.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Buy this album! This is the only kind of cd you should actually BUY.  We can download hits we hear on the radio from kazaa or morpheus since most of these mediocre bands can't follow up with a much anticipated masterpiece of an album.  This disappointment DOES NOT come with Is This It?.  You will only ask the question, &quot;Is This It?&quot; to demand more STROKES! <br />The best bands and movies don't need any hype to be extraordinary. Two examples:  The Strokes and Memento.  <br />SOLUTION:  DON'T LISTEN TO THE MEDIA
B00000JPYD|5.0|Robin Trower never got the attention that his peer Frank Marino got. He had a very tight power trio. This is a classic blues metal album. Don't miss this one!
7119005901|5.0|I have been interested in Asian history ever since I learned about the Sengoku Jidai in Japan, where many different clans were vying for control. My favorite is the Takeda clan who were constantly at war with the Uesugi clan. Then I studied about Mongolia, and learned about Genghis Khan, a name that at that time struck fear into everyone's hearts and sometimes a sword. Genghis Khan led the Tar Tars, or the horde as it is usually called, Genghis led the chinese to build the Great Wall which unfortunatly did not succeed in keeping the horde out, the Mongols then took over china and led to the Yuan Dynasty. But finally in my readings, I stumbled upon the Three Kingdoms a time when hundreds of heroes rose up to claim the greatest prize of all for their leaders, China, and many of them were willing to sacrifice everything.  Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Quan, were fighting for the control of China. When I got the book I soon realized I couldn't put it down. There was action, drama, everything in real life. And there were heroes Zhao Yun, Guan Yu, Dian Wei, Xu Huang, are just a few of many heroes who rose up in this time of need. The Three Kingdoms is truly a timeless tale of epic proportions.
B00005JKJA|4.0|I think the above statement best sums up this movie.  You think you have a grasp on what's going on in the first two thirds of the movie, and then Lynch goes completely nuts.  I can't even begin to explain what this movie is about because honestly I don't think David Lynch knows.  But I must say that even though I didn't understand it, I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  Hilarious, bizzare, unpredictable... it's quite the romp through Lynch's mushroom filled mind.
B000003TA4|3.0|I just heard this disc for the first time yesterday, simply to see what all the fuss was about.<br />Well, what's all the fuss about??<br />Anybody can yell into a microphone, folks. My cat would sound better than this guy. Also, the chords he uses are cliched and overdone, the Sex Pistols did them much better, and those guys could barely even play!<br />Still, there is a lot of troo emotion in these songs, and the drumber does lay down phat beats. However, if you're looking for da troo punk, I'd purchase harder-edged items like Blink-182, Boxcar Racer, and almost anything by Green Day, especially their later stuff like the song \\"Time of Your Life,\\" which will trooly make you cry.<br />PEACE FROM THE EAST!!
B000066NW0|5.0|OO I LOVE this cd!!  Unlike all the other singers out there, Avril is not pop.  That's what I love about her!!  And her voice is soo pretty.  She has great songs that tell stories unlike a lot of the ... out there today.  She's totally real and this CD is definitley worth getting.  She's not afraid to be different, and she does it in such a way that she stands out (which is a good thing) from the rest!!  Don't get me wrong, pop isn't bad, but it's really refreshing to hear new music from a genre taken over by mostly male.  GO AVRIL!!
B00005UKKF|5.0|I think Britney Spears is such a great performer! Her moves are amazing and the show is a lot of fun.  This DVD is great. It shows up close what you don't get to see at the concert...unless you have seats right on the stage. Britney does lip sync in concert on some of the faster songs, and you can tell in the video, but she dances so awesome that it just makes up for it!  If you're looking to buy it because of her \\"singing ability\\" then don't, because you'll be disappointed by the appearance of lip syncing, but if you want to see how awsome she is onstage then it's a must have.  The video was spectacular and made me want to see her in person.
B000066NW0|5.0|Hello Avril, You are a very gifted and talented young lady. I'm sure that you will be an extremely successful musician since you're already off to such a fantastic start. Your voice is beautiful and you have a really refreshing originality to your music and I love how &quot;real&quot; your songs are. It's about time someone like yourself made it in the music business. By the way, I'm probably old enough to be your mom, and I think that your style is fantastic. Also I have to ask if you are related to anyone in Michigan, U.S.A. as we share the same last name, and my mother and grandparents on her side were from Canada also. I wish you all the best in your career, take it to the highest place that Heaven will allow as you sing like an Angel!
0441172717|5.0|Frank Herbert built three dynasties inside a galactic empire that is based on melange, a drug that was available on one planet only -- Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Using melange, navigators have the power to fold space, which allows space travel.<br />In spite of a blood feud that was more deadly than Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets, Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV takes the rule of Dune away from the Harkonnens and gives it to the House Atreides.  He has his reasons.  The scene is set for political intrigue, sabotage, subterfuge, war, romance, survival, revolt, and revenge.<br />Dune is a masterpiece.  It was the first novel to win the Nebula Award (1965), and it shared the Hugo Award in the following year (1966).  Not only are the plots and characters intricate, but also the political, financial, religions, lifestyles, military, and honor structures are created.  Dune is like no place on Earth.<br />This book is written from multiple points of view (POV), and you know every main character in the book because you are privy to their thoughts.  The abundant use of Italics is unacceptable in today's market, yet it is one of the most effective aspects of Dune.<br />The effect of knowing what someone thinks while they say or do something else is an ability most people would like to have.  Jessica, concubine to Duke Atreides, a Bene Gesserit witch, and Paul's mother trains him, against the wishes of the witches, to use his mind for control.  The most powerful Bene Gesserit tests Paul Atreides, as she holds his mind captive she wonders if \\"he is the one.\\"  Fremen believe he is Muad'Dib, the messiah who will deliver them, even as they challenge him in a fight to the death.<br /><br />I have read this book and the sequels several times.  Like Paul Atreides, I dreamt of new philosophies and awakenings.  Dune is required reading for anyone who loves Science Fiction.<br />Victoria Tarrani
B00005JKMQ|1.0|We were not nearly as impressed over this movie as we hoped to be.  It's not Will's fault (he was great actually) it's just that the movie gives you a quick overview of his life and you never really get to know the character at all.<BR>It was more facts than anything (which we already knew) and not as personal or dramatic as we would have liked.  Definetly not worth a buy!
B00005LMBK|2.0|I bought this cd thinking it would have songs like clint eastwood.  I was wrong.  There are only two songs that are good on this cd.  They are clint eastwood and the clint eastwood remix.  The rest of the songs are very slow paced and just weird.  I definitely don't recomend this cd.
B000066NW0|4.0|The songs in this debut album is decidedly two sided.  On one side, you have the heart felt, folky music accompanied (usually) by strong vocals.  On the other, you have a very...uninspiring lyrics -'she was a girl he was a boy how can I make it more obvious ... sk8er boi', 'I'm feeling nervous trying to be perfect, I know your worth it, you're worth it, yeah ... Things I'll never say'.<br />Listening to some of the songs with gorgeous melody with such lyrics was cringe inducing.  But a funny thing happened on my wasy past the 5th or 6th listening of the CD...the lyrics stop mattering.  Those same songs that made me think of how better it would have been if Poe or Fiona Apple did the singing instead of Avril, felt quite natural with her vocals.<br />Don't let the first impression of her songs disuade you from this purchase.
B0000631QG|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I enjoy all of &quot;PORCUPINE TREE'S&quot; Cd's, but this one is more of a New Age Instrumental Jam Background Disk. Very well Produced and Performed (Time &amp; Patience make's it flow), I like it for it's uniqueness, but then again I like all of PT's Disk, Don't like to compare but they are the closest any band has come in the last 20 years to have that &quot;PINK FLOYD&quot; Feel... (try Spock's Beard for a &quot;YES&quot; &amp; &quot; GENTLE GIANT&quot; touch...) <BR>   Recommended for true followers &amp; fans, if you haven't heard them before start with Lightbulb Sun, Signify or Stupid Dream...<BR>   The early stuff is also excellent....<BR>   Maybe with a little more listening they might get 4 stars.<BR>             Peace.... while you Watch the &quot;Sky move Sideways&quot;
B00005J6UP|4.0|Really I should know better than to enjoy this film that was so obviously made with kids in mind. Yet there was something about this film that I couldn't help but respond to. Maybe it was the fact that I, like the kids in this film grew up in a northwest climate during the eightees. Or maybe it was the fact that I too dreamed of pirates and finding buried treasure as a kid.<br />Anyway, I really did enjoy watching this film. It has suspenseful moments, exciting action sequences, and incredible sets. The kids were all quite likable, indeed I remember kids like the goonies while I was growing up. I think all of us have met people like Chunk at some point, a worrisome, glutinous, but good natured kid. Steven Spielberg wrote the story for this film, and his influence can certainly be felt throughout. Interestingly, the climax of the film foreshadows Spielberg's \\"Hook\\" which he would make a few years later. I guess making that film was always at the back of his mind.  Richard Donner was the director.  Donner also directed \\"Superman\\" and adds an amusing little reference to that film.<br />The DVD is well worth purchasing as it allows the film to be shown in its original widescreen aspect ratio. The Goonies was shot as a widescreen film, as a result the pan & scan VHS cuts out a lot of the image making it difficult to see what is going on.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I confess to being a Robert Altman fan.  I love most of his work (but not all).  I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable film and I recommend it to people who enjoy non-linear, non-Hollywood films.  This is a dream cast of the best of British actors, going through their paces in a delicious satire/social comedy/mystery delineating in great detail the different lives of the different classes in 1930's England.<br />This is Upstairs/Downstairs with attitude!  These Downstairs servants are neither in love with or in awe of their social \\"betters\\" Upstairs.  Far from it!  They find their Lords & Masters for the most part silly, stupid, vain, dull and penny-pinching cheapskates ( especially when it comes to paying their Serving class, at any rate).  <br />We get to observe and contrast the two classes throughout the course of the film:  the Upstairs at play, busily screwing each other both literally and figuratively, while, the Downstairs lot work like the devil to keep these precious Aristos in ease and comfort.  All of this done in typical Altman understatement and casual, almost throwaway observation & dialogue.<br />I found the period detail wonderful, and the wit droll and precise.  As I said, it is a dream cast of the cream of British acting so everyone is spot-on.<br />I will admit the dialogue and sound can be difficult to catch, what with the accents and all.  Here's a suggestion: it's a DVD, put on the hearing impaired captions.  I did, so that I wouldn't miss a single bit of dialogue.<br />And finally, I am glad the murder mystery resolved itself the way it did.  A nice bit of ironic justice, and a nice bit of final revelation of character(s).  I changed my rating from 4 to 5 just to offset all the terrible reviews this film did not merit.  I would give it 4-1/2 actually.  For Godsake if you didn't get this film, then stick with Spiderman and leave Robert Altman alone!
B0000033PB|3.0|Remember ELP? The prog giants of the 70's, who blasted out stunning prog epics, a sonic assault of Hammond B-3, Moog, gargantuan drumming and soaring vocals? Well, they're back, though they've changed a bit.<br />This album is one step in the tragic fall of these heroes of delightfully pretentious prog, the final blow being dealt five years later with the pitiful \\"In the Hot Seat.\\" While this album does have cringeworthy moments, it still is not completely devoid of musically satisfying material, though some of it is \\"guilty pleasures.\\"<br />The title track, and \\"Better Days\\" are actually good songs; slamming (though simplistic) drums, and punchy, hard hitting synthy instrumentation actually work to these tracks' advantage, as they are pretty enjoyable synth-rock tunes. <br />The instrumental tracks are decent enough. \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is a reworking of a classical piece, I believe, which almost becomes boring but is alright. \\"Changing States\\" is colorful and complex, but just doesn't pack much of a punch. \\"Closer to Home\\" is a wonderful little piano solo. Yes, it may be termed \\"easy listening\\" by some less perceptive listeners, but it sure is hard playing. It just goes to show that Emerson hasn't lost his nimble fingering yet, as it is one of those tracks that intimidates us keyboardists out there with rich chords and highly impressive chops.<BR> <BR>\\"Paper Blood\\" tries hard to rock, but just doesn't quite make it. The organ in it seems to lack the energy we've come to expect from a guy like Keith. \\"Burning Bridges\\" is not a song I'm proud to admit I like, but the cheesy chorus just sticks with me for some reason. \\"Farewell to Arms\\" is really just too cheesy for me, becuase it seems to sound like something on a life insurance commercial or some other place where soulless \\"touchy feely\\" music is needed.<br />As for the acoustic ballads, what has happened to those kick ass songs like \\"From the Beginning\\" and \\"Still You Turn Me On?\\" These tracks make Lake's now wornand husky voice stand out like sore thumb, not to mention the lyrics are quite sappy and the songwriting makes me shiver. That said, \\"Footprints in the Snow\\" is just a guilty pleasure I enjoy.<br />This is really only an album for die-hard fans, because its likely not many other people will take pity on these aging rockers and their attempts to bring back the power of old.
B000066I6N|5.0|Robert Plant, now in his 50s, still SMOLDERS with a raw sensuality that eminates through every note he sings.  From the first time I heard a Led Zeppelin album when I was 12 to today (now I'm in my late 30s), Robert has been a fantasy figure in my mind, and I am sure the minds of many.  This album may be more subtle and less &quot;in your face&quot; than his work with Led Zeppelin, but his presence still commands the album and leaves you entranced.  I love the blues and Middle Eastern influences and the subtle dynamics of this album.  Great selection of songs and the musicianship is great as well.  I highly recommend this album!
B00005JKNF|2.0|While Gosford Park provides an excellent look into 1930s English country life, the movie moves very slowly and does not have much plot to it.  Once the murdered occured, I had hoped the plot and the pace would pick up, but neither did.  And while there are some great lines in the movie, they are not enough to keep things moving.  The costumes are very well done and the set is great; both are done to period.  However, the cinematography does not do them, nor the plot, justice.  The music is beautiful.  Hats off to Patrick Doyle for another job well done.  If you're looking for a study of 1930s English aristocrats and their servants, Gosford Park is the movie for you.  If you're wanting a period who-done-it that twists and turns and keeps you rivetted to the end...watch Clue.  You'll find it much more enjoyable.
0897500482|5.0|This is a great book for people interested in jeet kune do or Bruce Lee's wor and philosophy.  the book  showed alot of Bruce's art and explains alot of what he thought of martial arts.  Although all the drawings were mere sketches,  the point came across very clear and very detailed.  I rccomend this book and the book  Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's commentaries on the martial arts way (vol 3)  The Taao of Jeet kune do is really helpfu l but read both boos for more detailed understnding.
B000003S09|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Well, I can't help but throw my 2 cents in about it. Every track on this album kicks ass.<br />Schizoid Man proves that Black Sabbath didn't invent heavy metal. King Crimson did 2 years before they even released their first album. Though the beginning and end of this track are straight-out hard-rock mayhem (complete with Lake's abrasive, distorted singing), the middle of this tune is what can only be termed as progressive jazz-metal, with some of the tightest band interaction ever heard. Absolutely unbeleivable stuff.<br />Any band that can put \\"Schizoid Man\\" and \\"I Talk to Wind\\" right next to each other on an album and get away with it MUST be doing something right. In contrast to the balls-to-the-wall controlled chaos of \\"Schizoid,\\" \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" is a soft ballad-esque track, full of flute, clarinet, subdued electric piano and soft, delicate vocals singing out lyrical psychedelia. Dig Ian McDonald's jammin' jazzy flute solo, too. Talk about diverse - Krimson goes from metallic meyhem to beautiful balladry in just a few minutes, and sounds great doing it.<br />\\"Epitaph\\" turns the tables once again, an epic, powerful track, that goes from quiet sections of bass, drums and acoustic guitar with subtle vox and light mellotron to full-blown orchestral grandeur. A very dark and emotional track. And what can I say? \\"Confusion... will be my epitaph\\" is one of the coolest lines ever written.<br />\\"Moonchild\\" provides the album with a great deal of heated controversy, fueled by the 12 minute minimalistic jamming that follows the psychedelic, muffled section at the beginning, that follows some discernible musical pattern. What follows is quite a bit of sparse, puncuated bursts of percussion and other instruments. Wether you love it, hate it, or just don't care, you have to acknowledge the fact that it took alot of balls to present this to the public, especially since no one at all was familiar with the trippy improvisational nature of prog rock yet. I like it, just becuase it is so damned strange.<br />\\"In the Court\\" is so influential that even shock jock Howard Stern and his adventurous young radio show interns attempted a modern hard rock cover of it in recent years (which was quite hysterical, acutally.) This song is sort of blueprint for years and years of prog rock pretentiousness, pompousness and epic grandeur. The lyrics are riddled with odd lines that seem to have and almost Tolkein-ish quality to them, or some sort of mythical/fantasy feel in general. And indeed, the feel of the song follows suit with the darkly fantastic lyrics, with the melancholy \\"ahhh\\" chorus, dark acoustic verse sections and playful flute and mellotron solos.<br />This album is the prog-rock classic that gave birth to one of the most intriguing genres the music world has seen,  changing the face of music forever
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a very cute and charming character, with whom I feel a affinity with. And it is as though this love story mimics my own. It is a very touching story, and truly does make me incredibly happy about the world. It makes me think that there just may be some goodness in it. Its the one of the mot uplifting movies I have ever seen. And the french look, and sounds make it all the more better and more enjoyable. A look which is truly unique, colorful and beautiful. I would certainly recommend this to those that enjoy only the finest cinema.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I went into this movie expecting absolutley nothing.  And, I came out a little surprised.  It was better than expected, but lacked in certain areas, mainly the story and characters.<br />Now, I'm sure most people were going to compare this to the original.  Of course it's not going to live up to the original, that's why it's the original!  And in defense of this particular remake, look at some of the other remakes these days - i.e. &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;. <br />This time around, the story is greatly changed from the original, but the story isn't exactly what makes this movie &quot;good&quot;.  It's the special f/x.  The story, however, isn't tedious, and actually has some interesting thoughts.  I especially enjoyed the paradoxes involved, even if they weren't followed through after they were mentioned.  Guy Pearce does a marginal job, nowhere close to his role in &quot;Memento&quot;.  Samantha Mumba is okay, better than most pop stars in movies nowadays.  And Mr. Irons?  Even though his appearance is short, you hate him the entire time.  A good job for a villain.<br />As I said, the special f/x made this movie.  I was surprised that it was as different from the original as it was.  But it's not a bad thing.  The story is enjoyable, and I was pleased to see that Pearce's character didn't turn into a bonafide hero like Rod Taylor did in the original.  It could have been much better, but it could have been A WHOLE LOT WORSE.  I'd reccommend this to people who haven't seen the original, and people who are in the mood for some semi-mindless action.
6303471714|2.0|I did this video when it first came out a few years back. I did it religously for a few monthes until my knees started hurting. I saw no results from this video. If Cindy Crawford knew what she was doing she wouldn't have used her body monetum to lift the weight in the video. I now go to a gym that has trainers available to actually SHOW me the right form so I don't hurt myself.
0316666343|5.0|Heavenly......literally. Engaging, human, psychologically very real. By far, best read of the summer.
B00005JLDW|4.0|Reign of Fire had the premise, had the actors, had the budget, had the special effects, had all those great things in which to have made it an unbelievably fantastic movie.  But alas, it fell a bit short of what it could've been.  And why is this?  Execution!  Maybe with a better script, the movie wouldn't have seemed so...lackluster and boring.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie (especially the Dragons, which deserve 2 stars right there).  But it tended to drag in some parts.  Blockbusters are not supposed to drag.  Also, the story seemed kind of rushed.  They wanted to set up how the drags had taken over the world by showing clips and having a small narrative by Bale (which was a good idea) but then, BAM!  The movie begins and we see that stupid family raiding the crops.  You know a dragon is going to pop out.  And what happens?  A DRAGON POPS OUT.  I think they could've made a better way to play that out.<br />And the ending was corny.  McCoughnehey was supposed to be a smart leader.  But in the end, he jumps out of a tower with an ax after a dragon in midair?  A little cheesy, don't you think?  And the \\"passing of the torch\\" at the end between Bale and his adopted son was very corny and seemed very contrived.<br />But this movie had a lot of good in it.  For the most part, it was entertaining.  The dialogue was not bad at all.  The settings, drags, effects, etc etc were all perfect.  The action in the movie was great (that is, when they had action).  All in all, a good movie that seemed rushed.  I give it a B-, or 3.5 stars.
B000067G3C|5.0|This and Die Hard are my two favorite action movies of all time. Keanu Reeves did a great job. Dennis Hopper also did an outstanding performance. My favorite part is when Jack is fighting with Howard Payne on top of the train and Payne gets his head.....never mind I'm not going to spoil it for those haven't seen it. Rent this movie on video or DVD. I assure you that you'll enjoy it...
B0000683DH|4.0|While any Trekker worth their weight in Tribbles will make this purchase a no-brainer, it would have been even more valuable with the original  \\"Space Seed\\" episode on the bonus disk.
B00005J6T1|4.0|This is the debut album from a Bay City Italian-American singer named Madonna Ciccone.  Her first single was an r&amp;b disco number called &quot;Holiday.&quot;  It wasn't a huge hit, but it made an impact on the r&amp;b and pop charts and put the soon-to-be Material Girl on the map.  Like that single, the rest of the album is a solid collection of r&amp;b grooves that still hold up well despite their 80s production.  We all know the hits &quot;Borderline&quot; and &quot;Lucky Star,&quot; but I think the best songs on &quot;Madonna&quot; are the perky &quot;Burning Up,&quot; the catchy &quot;Physical Attraction,&quot; and her underground club hit &quot;Everybody.&quot;  On the first listen, Madonna's debut may seem nondescript and bland, but, as with all good records, the grooves grow on you and make a lasting impression.  It would pave the way for a tremendous career, which would cement Madonna's status as a venerable icon in pop culture.  This record obviously isn't her best, but if you want to know Madonna's musical roots, you needn't look any further than here.
B00005Y228|5.0|Who likes cheesy europop?? Not me- but for some incredibly strange reason I love this album!<BR> Kylie can't really sing that well, but the album is filled with catchy dancy records that just &quot;can't get outta your head&quot;. <BR> If you want slow, this isn't for you. All of Kylie's emotions are portrayed in dance beats which is in some ways a lot better. <BR> I live in UK and I do feel Kylie is slightly overated here, but I still love her music. &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; is by far the best track, and the only song I dislike is &quot;Burning Up&quot; because it feels a bit out of place.<BR> The music is heavily based upon a 70s theme and the track &quot;Fever&quot; is very Europop (not in a bad way, though).<BR> <BR>So if you like pop or light dance, you'll love it.
B00005K3LW|4.0|This is the second best in the series. It's better than Die Hard 2:Die Harder but worse than the original. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are great in this movie. Simon Gruber(Jeremy Irons) is a great villian. It is a great ending to the Die Hard Trilogy.
0375507507|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. The events that take place are remarkable and unusual for most people. She does not seem to cover up or obscure anything, so it was like being a fly on the wall of the Fuller's home. The writing style is unique and interesting. The worst thing about this book is that it had to end. I was so caught up in it that I would have enjoyed reading about she and her family's life after she left Africa. If I had to offer one suggestion for future printings, it would be to include a glossary of African language and slang words that were used. Though it almost always was easy to guess the meaning of these words, sometimes it was not and would have been helpful to have had a glossary.
B000002N3J|5.0|Madonna's is so well-known for her bouncy dance hits that her ballads sometimes get overlooked.  After all: &quot;Live to Tell,&quot; &quot;This Used to be My Playground,&quot; and &quot;Crazy for You&quot; all went to No. 1, proving that she can belt out a slow jam and do so convincingly.  &quot;Something to Remember&quot; is a collection of her ballads, and they all have none of the sap you'd find from certain singers I won't name (I'm being nice today).  The disc opens with a collaboration with trip-hop gurus Massive Attack.  The song is a cover of Marvin Gaye's &quot;I Want You.&quot;  My best friend, a music lover of the old school, despised this cover, but I think she pulled it off well by turning it into a slow groove of electronica.  My two favorites are the ones produced by David Foster: &quot;You'll See&quot; and &quot;One More Chance.&quot;  These are two of Madonna's best songs ever, and they are the sincere, effective ballads that Diane Warren could only dream of writing.  There's also the No. 1 &quot;Take a Bow&quot; by Babyface, and my personal favorite, &quot;This Used to Be My Playground.&quot;  If you want a collection of ballads with none of the Celine Dion aftertaste, this disc is the way to go.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I like John Mayer's Style.  Many people think he's too commercial to be a singer/songwriter that has some meaning.  I think otherwise.  I enjoy his cd very much.  My favorites are Neon, 83, No Such Thing, and Your Body is a Wonderland.  It's rock with a little blues and jazz mixed.  Saw him in concert also, sounded great, performed well.  I hope to hear more from him in the future.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is the best action movie of all time. Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Bonnie Bedlia, Reginald VelJohnson, Paul Gleason, and Alexander Godunov star in the movie. It is about New York cop John McClane(Bruce Willis) who comes to visit his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) and his kids in Los Angeles for the Christmas Holiday. On Christmas Eve while John waits for Holly in her office, mostly German terrorists lead by Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman), seize control of the 40 story highrise. McClane escapes unnoticed and is in a race against time to save his wife and thirty other hostages. Many Peole will agree with me that this is one of(if not the) best Action movie. The sequels are pretty good. I thought that Die Hard with a Vengeance was the best sequel. See this movie and all those movies that rip this off! It has a very exciting finale!
B00006EXL5|5.0|Did you ever listen to a band for the first time and have them totally take your breath away? This is what listening to My Chemical Romance could do for first time listeners. Hailing from Belleville, New Jersey this five piece band is a refreshing and unique entry into the Hardcore genre. Mixing brilliant lyrics and powerful vocals this band goes above and beyond any hardcore or emo band of late. Some stand out tunes on this cd are &quot;Cubicles&quot;, 'Vampires Will Never Hurt You&quot;, and &quot;This is the Best Day Ever&quot;. The band has already gained recognition by opening for Thursday and this cd is produced by Geoff Rickely the lead singer for Thursday. Certainly not a bad start for a first time effort. To get the full My Chemical Romance experience you have to see them live because the energy this band displays is almost magical. Without a doubt this is a stunning debut for a band that could very well be very big one day.
B00005J6T0|4.0|Truth be told, &quot;True Blue&quot; isn't my favorite Madonna album, but's still a solid effort that would continue her streak of hits.  By this point, Madonna completely phased out of her r&amp;b roots, opting for more pop-oriented material.  &quot;True Blue&quot; is full of those songs, and it features one of her most memorable ballads, &quot;Live to Tell,&quot; which was featured in then-husband  Sean Penn's film &quot;At Close Range.&quot; The single &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; (which Kelly Osborne would later cover, and rather impressively) is a heartfelt tune about a pregnant teen who wants to keep her baby.  &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; and the title track are also good, well-written slices of pure pop.  But the song that's my personal favorite is the closer, &quot;Love Makes the World Go Round,&quot; which should have been released as a single but wasn't.  Madonna performed this danceable number at Live Aid, and it's one of her best songs.  Those who are looking for the r&amp;b flavor of her debut may be slightly disappointed in &quot;True Blue,&quot; but it's still an overall winning mix of really good pop tunes.
B0000640VO|4.0|Great film.  Hilarious in parts, charming and fun throughout.  Unfortunatly it's so fast, that you have to be a speed reader to get it the first time.  I love foriegn films, but Miramax blew it when they didnt offer this with an English dubbed version.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Back in 1984, Madonna gave an unforgettable performance of \\"Like a Virgin\\" at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Dressed in a wedding gown and prancing around the stage, it was a delightful preview of her second record, produced by Nile Rogers.  \\"Like a Virgin\\" is an impressive step forward from her debut album and shows a more confident, self-assured Madonna.  The bouncy \\"Material Girl\\" would be one of her signature hits, even though Madonna herself is quietly distancing herself from that song.  Too bad, because it's a great tune.  Like that song, the rest of the album is full of hook-infested pop tunes such as the energetic \\"Dress You Up,\\" \\"Over and Over,\\" and \\"Angel,\\" which is a favorite of mine.  Her cover of \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" also holds up well, as does the disc's fine closer, \\"Stay.\\"  \\"Like a Virgin\\" sold substantially more than its predecessor, and deservedly so.  It's one of my favorite Madonna albums and smartly dodges the sophomore slump.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Even though I thought this was one of the most horrible movies out there, I would totally recommend that you go out and rent it.  Make sure it is an evening you're completey bored and have nothing better to do.  I won't tell you how bad it is but let me just say that when you think it COULD be over it just keeps going...and going...and going...and going...  If the DVD were a little cheaper I would buy it just so I could own The Best WORST Movie of All Time.
0698119347|4.0|When fourteen year-old Alex Rider hears of his uncle's tragic death in an auto accident, he becomes immediately suspicious.  Ian Rider had been a banker, a very careful man.  He was also Alex's only living relative.  Following up on his uncle's car, Alex discovers that the car is at a junkyard and is sporting dozens of bullet holes and blood on the seats that proves his uncle was murdered.  So who killed Ian Rider and covered the act up?  And why?  Alex's quest for the truth introduces him to Alan Blunt, a spymaster for Great Britain's MI6 espionage agency.  Caught while seeking further information, Alex is blackmailed by Blunt into becoming the youngest spy to ever work for MI6.  Herod Sayles, a multi-millionaire, is giving away thousands of his newest computer, Stormbreaker, to the children of London's schools.  Ian Rider was investigating the man and those machines when he was killed.  If Alex doesn't agree to undertake the mission, Blunt promises that he will be sent off to an orphan's home, and that his housekeeper, Jack Starbright, will be deported back to America.  Before he can adjust to getting blackmailed, Alex is sent on a three-week crash course training with SAS commandos.  Yanked out of training, Alex is thrown headlong into the grinning jaws of death where he will meet a spectacular array of villains, including Mr. Grin who has had his face disfigured during a throwing knife accident in a circus, and a huge jellyfish.<br />Anthony Horowitz is a successful writer of novels and television shows.  His second Alex Rider novel, POINT BLANK, is out this year.  In addition, he's written historical thrillers, THE SINISTER SECRET OF FREDERICK K. BOWER and THE DEVIL AND HIS BOY.  He's also written a series of books involving the FIVE including THE DEVIL'S DOOR-KNOB, NIGHT OF THE SCORPION, and THE SILVER CITADEL.  His work for television lists scripts for POIROT and MIDSOMER NIGHTS, and he has created his own television show, MURDER IN MIND.<br />STORMBREAKER is an exciting, easy to read, and hard to put down novel.  The breakneck pace of the story draws the reader on, and the simple use of the language to convey the story make it that much easier to read just one more page, and another, and another.  However, the simple writing evokes full images, cast and settings.  And there are twists and turns aplenty in the story.  Alex is very likeable, and he's very much like James Bond must have been at that age.  Not only is he quick and mildly sardonic, but he gets equipped with a cutting-edge tech GameBoy equipped with spygear, zit cream that eats through metal, and a yo-yo that doubles as a winch, serving him as well as Spider-Man's weblines.<br />Even though the pace is driving and the descriptions are wonderful, the book could have used a little more dialogue.  The dialogue that the author uses is pretty much spot-on, but more of it was needed.<br />STORMBREAKER is an excellent read for anyone interested in action adventure novels and spy stories.an exciting, easy to read, and hard to put down novel.

0375420525|5.0|Geez, this book needs a positive review, its awesome.  So, to all of you why have given the book bad reviews, I would like to say that you have entirely missed the point of the style of the book, I almost said novel, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  <br />This is a true montage, a vast collection of a variety of material, presented in such a way as to give a feeling entirely different than that experienced from an modern novel.  To understand this, think of the credibility you give to any documentary, to any work of non-fiction complete with footnotes and sources.  Think of the way you are moved by a photograph simply by its being a photograph or the structural consequences of placing letters to the fictional editor as an appendix to the work added by a second set of fictional editors.  <br />The final result is the experience of delving into this fictional house in the same way as the characters in the book, piecing everything together, while at the same time being a little confused, overwhelmed, or discouraged.  <br />This book easily makes my top 10. I would recommend it to anyone willing to try something other than the typical novel and who enjoys thinking about what they read (better said, this is the typical novel of the digital age, the sythesis of a variety of art forms, the convergence of fiction and the reality created by image, coupled with catchy colors and swirling print in the music TV manner we've come to expect from our spoon-fed art.)  Not for members of book clubs that love life affirming endings or ye Clive Cussler fans.
0312954468|2.0|Many reviewers seem to forgive Taita's utter perfection and endless accomplishments and talents - this eunuch single-handedly invented, saved, or was otherwise responsible for every single aspect of Egyptian history and art that has survived the ages. How anyone can claim realism with this character is beyond me - better Smith had just called him a living god or alien or something; made River God some surreal mystic fantasy. Then Taita could manipulate Egyptian culture with impunity. By making him an utterly powerful, perfect human, Smith destroyed all ability to draw me into the story or create empathy for his characters. I was actually hoping that something, ANYTHING would go wrong for Taita. Lose a bet, make a bad decision, break a fingernail, anything; but this supercharater eventually won every time. His other characters were even more shallow and less memorable.  But at least Smith can write complete sentences and coherent paragraphs (Anne Rice, please take note), so River God gets 2 stars instead of one.<br />Also the follow-on, seventh scroll, is an utter waste of a tree. If you did enjoy River God, skip 7th scroll so that the storyline doesn't get destroyed for you.
B0000000LI|5.0|I first saw and heard this album on videotape, and was so taken with the music and imagery that I went out and bought the audio version.  I have listened to it countless times, and I never tire of hearing these beautiful songs.  I had opportunity to see Yanni in concert several years ago, and he was just as good in person.  I only wish that the audio version had &quot;Aria&quot; which is on the video.  I highly recommend this album.
B000002LKF|4.0|Following the success of  his travels to Africa for \\"Graceland,\\" Simon travels  to South  America to continue  with his  work exploring different  sounds.  Like \\"Graceland,\\"  this album  has a  lot of exotic  percussion and  rhythm for  the listener.<br />Regardless  of the percussion, this is a collection of mellow sounds that carry you along with Simon as he continues  his journey.  Songs like \\"The Coast\\" and \\"Further to Fly\\" will bring images of the Amazon as you soak up the rhythm.<br />The sleeve for the CD has the lyrics and credits, but no additional information.   Although this  is not bad,  I would  like to have read a  bit more about the creation of  the album.<br />As with most Paul Simon  albums, this  is no  dance album.  Some  of the  songs are upbeat, like \\"Proof\\" and  \\"Obvious Child,\\" but I recommend you  listen to  this  when you  want  to relax  and reflect,  possibly propping up your feet.
B000066I6N|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive when I heard Robert Plant was doing an album of old songs.<BR>But fear not, he comes through. It's not an album of hit singles, instant rock out gratification or bump and grind metal. <BR>You need to listen to the whole thing to really connect with the vibe Plant is putting across. After a few listens it really grows on you. It has a psychdelic, melodic, trippy, 60's / 70's rock feel to it. And make no mistake it's definitely a rock album. <BR>Years from now fans will return to this album and the underrated but equally as great \\"Fate of Nations&quot; for the definitive solo Plant. Just saw him in NYC and it was great. He really looks to be enjoying himself and that's what music is all about.

0553381709|5.0|Yes, you read right--George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice is BETTER than Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Why is everyone afraid to admit this? Yes, Tolkien is a genius--the fantasy genre wouldn't exist without him, and no doubt, A Song of Fire of Ice couldn't have been written. But ... each of Martin's books are more entertaining than Tolkien's trilogy. I get bored at times reading The Lord of the Rings; I barely sleep when I read each of the 700+ page Martin books. Am I alone?
B0000667RO|1.0|I am sitting here in an office being forced by my colleague to listen to this CD and what can i say but- Is he the male Celiene Dion? I just cannot get over how bland and truly awful the music is. If there were a Comission for Crimes Against Music he would be suspect number one. Everytime i hear his music my skin simply crawls.Please tell me i am not the only one?<BR>Back to the album- what i can i say but truly, truly appalling.

0060920084|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Bryson's book about his journey through small town America.  Several times I was laughing out loud and had to read aloud to my husband.  If you are from a small town, you will be able to relate to the author's observations and experiences.  Yes, he does at times seem a bit cruel in his comments but take it with a grain of salt.  His genuine love for his home country is obvious.  I recommend the book for several good laughs.

6301404440|4.0|There have been numerous films which mixes live action with animation but never before has anything like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" been made. This movie is literally sharing the human world with the animated world.<br />When a detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), has his brother killed by a toon, he swears he will never work with toons again. So after doing one quick job for Roger Rabbit's boss, he believes he'll never have to be with any toon again. Unfortunately, Roger Rabbit (voice by Charles Fleischer) is framed for the murder of the man who owns toon town! With the help of Dolores (Joanna Cassidy), Eddie must discover who the murderer is, and also find out what the murderer's evil plan is. Of course Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), Roger Rabbit's wife, is acting mighty suspicious... And so is the Vile Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd). Could either of them have had anything to do with the framing of Roger Rabbit?<br />\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" must surely be congratulated for the spectacular cartoon and special effects work. The story and plot might be a bit overboard but just watching all the eye-popping fun is worth it. And the movie is filled with underlying jokes and lots of slapstick humor. The acting is also done pretty well, from Eddie Valiant the hard-bitten and serious detective and to most noticeably, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom who isn't all who he seems.<br />Also you get to see all of your favorite cartoons who you've known forever, along with hearing the guys who did the original voices: Mickey Mouse and his gang, and Mel Blanc doing the voices of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Sylvester and Tweety Bird. There also Mae Questel as Betty Boop who had done her voice from 1930 until the character was retired in 1949. And plus plenty for characters including one of my favorites, Droopy Dog!<br />But I can't tell you any more of the story or any of the jokes and fun parts or I'll ruin it for you. So if you're in the mood for a funny movie withlots of cartoons AND people, check out \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\". The movie is rated PG for some language and some pretty obvious and sometimes subtle innuendo (just look at Jessica Rabbit...). <br />A bit of trivia, Kathleen Turner who did the voice of Jessica Rabbit was uncredited. And Amy Irving did Jessica's singing voice.
B000002LBH|5.0|This record is a haphazard compilation of singles, b-sides and BBC sessions. Sometimes the quality is shaky and the track order makes zero sense. Some of the songs kind of [stink]. I think it could go for the best pop record of all time. <br />'The Queen is Dead' usually gets the nod as best Smiths album just because it's the most focused, but this has more than twice as many songs on it, and every legit Smiths record for that matter. This is the disc with all the great non-LP singles on it, like the folky, breakneck \\"Shakespeare's Sister\\", lounge standard \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\", rock-snob anthem \\"Panic\\" (\\"Hang the blessed DJ/Because the music he constantly plays/It says nothing to me about my life\\") and the quintessential Smiths song \\"Ask\\", filled to the brim with awkwardness, ambiguous sexuality, cold war dread and Johnny Marr's undeniable guitar magic. <br />But you could just go out and buy 'Singles' to get those. The real reason to buy 'Louder Than Bombs' is for the rarer tracks, which glow with personality and life. \\"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\\" *sounds* like the grey murky river that Morrissey describes in the lyric, in the song that cops the most from cover star Shelagh Delaney's wickedly funny and tragic play 'A Taste of Honey'. \\"Rubber Ring\\" is the most unique song in the Smiths' catalogue and maybe in all of pop music... it's a song about growing out of sad music. Who else but Morrissey could pen a lyric like \\"And when you're dancing and laughing and finally living/Hear my voice in your head and think of me kindly\\"? \\"Stretch Out and Wait\\" nails (sorry) the strangeness and longing of teenage sexuality. \\"Is It Really So Strange?\\" is an oddly poppy choice to kick off such a dark album, but it's still a fine song documenting a stalker's journey to meet his fixation. \\"Half a Person\\" is easily one of the Smiths' finest, a song of sick loneliness and desperation that manages to sound hopeful somehow. The placement of \\"Unloveable\\" and \\"Asleep\\" at theend make the case that perhaps the track order was not, in fact, decided upon by howler monkeys.<br />There are a few songs that sound somewhat dated today. Most of what makes the Smiths great is that, despite so many bands being influenced by them, they sound as fresh today as ever (especially to someone on this side of the Atlantic), but sometimes they come off a bit too much like 80's relics. Not often, but occasionally, say, on the uncharacteristically loud \\"London\\", the long, slow \\"Girl Afraid\\" or \\"These Things Take Time\\". The Twinkle cover 'Golden Lights' and instrumental 'Oscillate Wildly' (clever title, eh?) often get bad raps, but I think they place nicely off each other and break the album down the middle very well. <br />The messiness of the track order feels schizophrenic at times, but considering this is an music made for lonely teens, that's oddly appropriate. Not an album that's easy to listen to from front to back, but that's why God invented programmable CD players. Morrissey and Marr play off each other less like ice and fire than like a Ritalin and Prozac milkshake. Drink up.
B00000099Y|5.0|One would expect nothing less from a band with such a manifesto: 'Our goal remains to touch our audience on a deep, psychological level'.<br /> This is a truly groundbreaking work for the band, and for 'metal' as a whole, that rather poorly defined musical genre. Yet, Tool create and sustain their own, personal genre.<br />The album may be dark, with snatches of spite, justified anger and self-depreciation creeping subtely into the lyrics, yet the melancholy tendencies and anger are focused: the sheer intelligence driving these purveyors of rage is unquestionable, while the emotive and cathartic qulaities of the music only serve to entice and excite the listener further.<br /> Of course,the music itself is breathtaking: prominently bass driven song dynamics underpin stellar drumming from one of the best in the business, along with inspirational guitar lines and Maynard's honey coated, steel wrought vocals.<br /> Sadly,it is hard to fully praise this work without mentioning the songs themselves in some detail: loathe as I am to drag up an old cliche, in Aenima's case hearing really is believing.<br />However, a brief overview of the themes contained can easily differentiate this album from anything else recorded recently, possibly ever recorded: 'Stinkfist' concerns opening up to another person on a previously unexplored level, with the songs meaning delivered to us shrouded in a metaphor rather crudely suggested by the song's title, whilst Eulogy tackles the status of an unnamed friend who 'Had a lot of nothing to say' as a martyr, or otherwise.<br />Later tracks such as '46&2' and 'Aenima' explore Jungian philosophy and the hypothetical benefits of that 'hopeless hole' LA being 'flushed away' by a cataclysmic earthquake respectively.<br />In short, the album is a masterpiece of stunning musicianship and lyrical complexity-even incorporating excerpts from the late comedian Bill Hicks and numerous (criminally misunderstood, let alone necessary) segues into its fabric.<br />Tool not only challenge on a psychological level, they fully justify the price of the album: years on it still spins in my CD player every day.<br />Essential, compelling, unforgettable.only challenge on a psychological level, they fully justify the price of the album: years on it still spins in my CD player every day.<BR>Essential, compelling, unforgettable.
6305205620|5.0|Say what you will about Metallica, but one thing you can't deny is that they always put out the best home video releases, especially when it comes to them playing live.  Cunning Stunts was recorded before \\"ReLoad\\" was released, and features the boys at their best.  \\"Fade To Black\\", \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", \\"Creeping Death\\", \\"Nothing Else Matters\\", \\"King Nothing\\", \\"So What\\", and \\"Sad but True\\" are all brought to life live great, but there are a few minor gripes.  Kirk does mess up a bit on the solo to \\"One\\", and on some of the older songs (like the Kill/Ride medley) James seems like he's having trouble remembering his parts.  But, the good outweighs the bad in the end, besides the great concert, the DVD features are outstanding, and the picture and sound quality can't be beat; this is how a concert DVD should be done.  All in all, this is an essential item if your a Metallica fan, and it is worth every penny.
6305922756|5.0|Not only is THIS IS SPINAL TAP one of my favorite comedies, but you almost get three movies in one package.  There is over an hour of deleted material (albeit, most of them were deleted for a good reason), but what makes this version of the DVD shine is its commentary track.  Keeping with the mockumentary feel of the film, the three main cast members provide insight on the movie IN CHARACTER, taking stabs at Rob Reiner's character, all the while trying to improve their tarnished image portrayed in the film.  Even the animated menu is funnier than some films' actual content.  This DVD definitely goes to 11.
