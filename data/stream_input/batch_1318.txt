B005XQLBU4|5.0|I like the overall strategy of the game. Its simple yet entertaining. Could offer a little more points for like unused missiles. This was an excellent pickup for FAOTD.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Rare is the show that improves with age. Most shows would have jumped the shark by now.<br /><br />Not this one.<br /><br />I could write a book about this show--and even this season. It's so nuanced, so layered. Even if Giancarlo Espisito did not play the most memorable on-screen villan in recent memory, this season would have stood out. Gus Fring was nothing less than a revelation in Season IV, as we see why he is the way he is.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is stellar. The writing is top-notch. The plot: beyond deep.<br /><br />Best show on TV. Period.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a fun and challenging game. As a full time student with a full time job I am selective about how I spend my leisure time. I reach for Quell most of the time.
0545259088|4.0|This is the final instalment in The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, Maggie Stiefvater's style of writing is so different from everything else I have read, it grabs hold and won't let go. I am quite sad the story has come to an end, I could of went on to read about Sam and Grace's beautiful relationship Forever.<br /><br />The story starts with Grace shifting back to her human self, alone in a place she doesn't recognise at first. She asks to use a phone in a store and calls Sam to come get her. Sam rushes in the car to get to Grace, but when he does all that's left for him to find is the clothes she stole from somebody's washing line. The weather is not warm enough to hold her in her human form.<br /><br />Grace continues to shift back and forward over the weeks and every-time Sam just misses her. Cole is working on a cure and testing it out on himself, he nearly dies but Sam and Isabel save his life.<br /><br />Sam is under the suspicion of the police and Graces parents. When a body of a girl is found in the woods near his house the police bring him in for questioning.<br /><br />Eventually Grace becomes herself more firmly and finally gets to Sam. She stays in Sam's house and stays as a missing person until she is more firmly in her own body.<br /><br />Isabel's dad has managed to get the wolves taken off the protected list. An aerial hunt is scheduled, to track and kill all the wolves in the area. It's up to Sam to make a decision. They decide to try to move the wolves to a new location, that was offered up by an unlikely ally.<br /><br />Meanwhile Grace and her friend Rachel go to Graces Parents to try and get the police off Sam's back.<br /><br />The ending for me left me wanting so much more. there were definitely some shockers and heart rendering moments.<br /><br />The characters all really developed and came into their own in this one.<br /><br />Sam for me, out of everything I have ever read, is the most real character I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. I feel like I could walk into a bookshop and find his yellow eyes staring back at me from behind the counter. He really came into his own and I just love his fragile nature. His and Graces relationship is truly beautiful.<br /><br />Coal, oh boy, I just love him. He is so interesting, confident, charming and has a good heart. I would of loved to have seen him and Isabel together properly, I think they make a great match.<br /><br />Grace is such a grown up teenager, she is sensible, down to earth and totally relate-able. She is a beautiful person.<br /><br />The only thing for me was wanting to know so much more, but I guess that's the beauty of it. Also when Grace went home to her parents, where did she tell them she was all that time? That has been bugging me so much LOL.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater has done a fantastic job on the trilogy as a whole, it has been a pleasure reading each and every instalment. I would love to thank her for sharing sharing with us this amazingly beautiful tale.and find his yellow eyes staring back at me from behind the counter.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This charcoal colored cover for my Kindle works! It does everything as it is advertized. It's lightweight, unobtrusive, protective, easy to manage, and attractive in a subdued way. I usually purchase leather but am very satisfied with the synthetic material it is made of which is comfortable to the touch. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Lots of games....<br /><br />unfortunately, out of the 12 I have played, not 1 is worth mentioning<br /><br />games are worse than atari 2600 average games
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Atmospheric, simple yet challenging, and with the polish of a new car, quell is one of the best android games. Full review on Androinica.com
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! Dont bother trying other bible apps.  YouVersion has tons of translations, tons of reading plans, audio reading, very easy to use, and super easy to share on FB/Twitter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game. Its so fun to play every day! Thanx for da game! A game within games. Its amazing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of games. my  4 year old loves to play them. wish some games weren't so expensive to unlock. yep
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I couldn't put it down until I could no longer defend my city. My thumbs and fingers got too tired. I love the fact that you can choose to upgrade quantity, speed, and other factors as the game progresses. Great game.
B005OK721G|5.0|I found this movie to be entertaining, it is rare to see a woman of color have a leading part that delivers action and a good story line.  I found Zoe to hold her on.  The movie pulls you in and gets your attention with the story line and the action.  I do not like to tell much about a movie, but I will say that Amandla Stenberg in the beginning of the movie did an excellent job, it was an enjoyable action packed movie.
B005GVF95O|5.0|The 3 year old masterd it in matter of minutes, the good thig is that he doesn't tire from it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works well. Have had no problems whatsoever and it was very easy to install and use. I especially like the radar and long range forecast parts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are super fun and addictive. Entertains both kids and adults.  Games can be challenging but gives you enough direction to understand.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|i remember playing the classic missle defender and i must say, it's loads more fun on a touch screen device. 5 stars all the way
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Love this CD!  Was recommended by a co-worker.  Thanks to prime, I got it early enough to enjoy through the holiday season.
0060531053|5.0|I got this book for my husband who just started his home breweing hobby.  he has learned quite a bit from it and every spare minute I see him buried in this book learning new techniques.  Great supplemnent for the home brewing enthusiast.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|level ups, points, building expolding, what's not to like. it gets more challenging as you progress and its pretty addictive
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love my new Kindle Fire case.  Besides feeling great to hold, a bright vibrant red, the embossed names of cities around the world are intellectually intriguing.  It's a hit.  Luciella
B000FFJYCU|4.0|Grand Prix is an exceptionally well-directed, choreographed race film.  As others have noted, the film authentically captures Formula One racing in its heyday, before safety concerns and commercialization transformed the sport.  There's not another director in my book who has such a strong kinetic feel than John Frankenheimer.  The composition, editing, sound,  and use of split screens are all used effectively to convey the experience of both drivers and fans.  Though I'm not a knowledgeable race fun, it must be said that the design of mid-60s Formula One cars were gorgeous--elegant in their simplicity, with strong, clean lines.  In fact, a highlight for me was the 1960s aesthetic style on strong display in this film, from  go-go dancing and high fashion to interior shots during the various sub-plots.  Though the film's interpersonal melodramas function to highlight the psychology of the drivers---the film fails in this regard.  The racing scenes really function as a series of autonomous thrills, and don't carry with them the added emotional intensity of the private dramas.  The acting is decent, particularly the chemistry between Yves Montand and Eve Marie Saint---but the core of the film is racing.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I played this with my son and finished it in one night.  It made us think.  There aren't a lot of games that do that.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and challenging. The whole family can enjoy themselves. We give them 2 thumbs up. Tons of fun, for hours of play. Makes you think and keeps your reflexes up.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Amazing show... you will NOT be disappointed! Hilariously brilliant. Buy this DVD set, so that they don't pull the show off of NBC!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a clone of the original Missile Command game, with some subtle improvements. The graphics are somewhere in between when Missile Commander was written and today (2012), but the gameplay is solid, and ramps up nicely. Missiles and A-bombs come in from the top of the screen. You tap where you want interceptor missiles to fire to and explode. If the incoming missile hits the explosion from your interceptor, it's destroyed. Otherwise it keeps heading down and eventually blows up one of your cities or trees.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ Familiar game play, but with touch rather than a track ball<br />+ Ramp up is good. I thought it was too easy at first, but it got progressively harder until it was interesting.<br />+ You earn points each level you can use to repair cities or enhance missile performance. A nice touch!<br /><br />Con:<br />- Graphics could have been a bit spiffier, but they're certainly not bad.<br />- Each level is a 'day'. You can speed up the status screen between each day, but I wanted it to be faster still.<br /><br />Overall a nice game, and a good diversion for a minute or ten at a time.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book was an epic fail, a fantasy \\"Days of Our Lives\\" where the plot moves at a snail's pace and old familiar characters die off while new ones are introduced exponentially.<br /><br />I wonder if GRRRRM even knows where he is going with this book. This series has become akin to a movie that I heard was good, and started off good, but turned out to be bad, but I just keep watching either because I expect it to get better, or I have already invested so much time in it.<br /><br />I cannot understand why this would merit 5 stars from anyone other than those making money off of it. To me 5 stars makes it one of the all time best books I have ever read, one that I will reread again and again because it is so entertaining, one that I think fondly of, or causes me to think in new ways, or inspires me to change my life. How can this book be any of those things to anyone, even to the author?<br /><br />At most I would think it should get 3 stars, but that would only be due to it being part of a larger series. By itself it should get one star, if that.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of the book is the cliffhanger at the end, but if that situation turns out bad (character dies) then my interest in this series as a whole will die along with him.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is the best version of missile defender I have used. highly recommended for those of you who have always been intrigued by this game.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I think this game is great, fell for the first missile defense game years ago. This one is great.Thanks a lot
B006GG1KOC|4.0|This app is quite simple: it shows four pictures next to each other, and you tap on the one which isn't like the others. For example, it might show a sink, a toilet, a shower, and a cake. You tap on the cake because it's not something you'd (normally :)) find in a bathroom. A little ladybug at the top is watching what you do. Pick the wrong picture, and the ladybug makes a 'boing' sound. Pick the right one, and it flies and plays a short riff and then the next set come up, up to 125 different sets.<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ Great to teach your toddler matching and alike / different<br />+ Sounds and the ladybug are nice, and have retained my toddler's interest<br />+ Puzzles are a good variety of matching / different types<br /><br />Con:<br />- Some of the similarities are a bit too ambiguous, sometimes feeling arbitrary. This undermines what otherwise I consider to be a great app, hence the four stars.<br /><br />This app works great on my Kindle Fire. I think it's a good app for toddlers who are at the right stage of development, as long as you skip over the questionable matches.
B003KUZSWW|5.0|Amazing show. But I would like to call into question the reviews of the last two people. The last four episodes of this season are, in fact, listed on Amazon. The episodes 'Planet of the Dead,' 'The Waters of Mars,' and 'The End of Time: Parts 1 & 2' are listed as 'Dr. Who: The David Tennant Specials'. They are actually free for Prime members, too, just like the rest of the episodes. Hope this clears up any confusion!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great set of games. perfect for the stay at home parent. or even for children to occupy their minds for a short time. I love that they can stay within 1 app but play literally hundreds of games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are very addictive. I could not put it down for several hours. download now and. start having fun!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I never would have thought someone would make an app just to track the phase of the moon, and when it rises and sets. And, if they did, I never would have dreamed they would make such a *beautiful* app. You enter your location, and it renders the current phase of the moon for where you are, and indicates when it rises and sets. It even rotates the image of the moon to compensate for your location: wicked!<br /><br />Pro:<br />+ Simple, elegant user interface: moon set / rise for any day, and the portion of the moon 'full', as well as the ability to drag the shadow and be told what day / time it will look like that.<br />+ The picture of the moon and the shadow are amazingly well done. I stared at it for a while just to enjoy it.<br />+ I could see this being useful for those who have to care about the phase of the moon, e.g. those following a lunar calendar.<br /><br />Con:<br />- None. Beautiful app!<br /><br />I am using this on my Kindle Fire and got it for free. I may refer back to it to see when the moon is full and when it will be visible on the days it is: Seeing the full moon as it's rising at night is romantic, at least to me :)
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|This book lives up to Kinsella's writing style - cute, light hearted, and chicky. But, I found this book too childish for my tastes. It did not keep my attention and was very predictable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok I guess it good my kids love it it wastes there time but it a little cheaper than other apps
B000002TQB|4.0|I've been going through kind of a 90's music revival phase lately to remind me of just how much fun I used to have pre-career and paying real bills and all that.  I remember going to clubs in the 90's with my best friend and asking the DJ to play Girls and Boys.  We thought we were so hip requesting Blur amidst all the American grunge (which was also great by the way).  I also remember the cover with the crazy black dog on it that always kind of made me laugh (still does).  Anyway, listening to Blur today I'm surprised at how many influences I hear - Buzzcocks, Blondie (think Atomic), the Beatles, etc.  I really smiled rediscovering Blur again.  Blur is fun and kind of weird sort of like good electronica mixed with punk and rock.  It seemed to me on many tracks there is a big 80's influence as well.  Most of the songs are fantastic, although around song 9 there are a few in that area that I did not find as strong or as dynamic as a very strong beginning and end.  I don't like to compare bands to each other because I think every band holds something special but I will just say that if someone is a fan of Pulp, Oasis, Garbage, Weezer (thinking of some of the bands of that time) they would most likely enjoy Blur.  Blur can also be found on the Trainspotting soundtrack.  All in all Parklife gave me back a little piece of the 90's (best days of my life) that I really miss.  If you are thinking of starting a 90's collection, I would definitely say purchase Parklife and if you remember going to a club and dancing to Girls and Boys about a thousand times, then you should absolutely add Parklife to your collection.
0446573019|2.0|i'm a big Baldacci fan. His books go down quickly and are generally very entertaining. This one, however, reads like he had his 8 year old son create the main character and then write the story while he works on his real next book. I don't know if he has any children.
0385474547|5.0|\\"Things Fall Apart\\" was the product of my search for authentic African literature and it fulfilled my expectations. More than a fascinating tale, it is a look at a Nigeria that is being lost to a changing world. How fortunate that Chinua Achebe's talent was discovered and that his stories were brought to the rest of the world!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is very addictive, no issues on my kindle fire. look forward to more games by Epic Pixel. good job.
1592332803|5.0|This is a GREAT book!  I not only bake everything vegan, but also gluten free because my little girl is very allergic to wheat.  If you too can not eat wheat, you can use this book very well, just use different flours.  Everything I have made has been so good!    I also like that all the recipes seems so well worked out.  Just follow the recipes... they will turn out great.
B003L77G10|5.0|I was concerned about how long it would take to arrive.  It came within 3-4 days of ordering.  The quality of the video was excellent and in good condition. I would recommend them to anyone.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|awesome best game ever so fun aland a great in your free time play this game not a piece. of crap play really fun
0525478817|5.0|Up front, let me say that I am a huge, biased, crazy nerdfighter, or a fan of John and his brother Hank and all that they do on the internet. Now you know and can be an informed reader of this review.  The Fault in Our Stars vividly and unapologetically does away with the Cancer Kid stereotype, and does it with a realism that can only come from someone who has an intimate knowledge of cancer and what it does to a person.   John makes you care about the characters as if they were your best friends, and then takes them to the highest and lowest of possible places, bringing your emotions along. I cried for about four hours while reading this book, and when I wasn't crying, I was laughing so hard that I was crying. However, it never seemed as though the humor was only there for comic relief. It was always just what anyone would say or do in such a moment.
0553103547|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire is probably the best epic fantasy that has been published since Lord of the Rings. It is certainly one of the best written. I will admit, the first time I took a stab at A Game of Thrones was years ago, probably when I was only 16 or 17. I didn't even get thirty pages into it. The words made sense to me, and it was reasonably within my reading level, so I wasn't quite sure why I was so bored with it. It felt like the first time I tried to get into Pride and Prejudice-- I was just bored.<br /><br />Flash Forward three or four years, and I tried A Game of Thrones again. That time, I couldn't put it down. I flew through the series as fast as I could and then nearly hammered my head into a wall waiting for the most recent installment of the series, A Dance With Dragons. The change? Patience. I got older, and I became more patient with my literature. I learned to savor the experience and appreciate the structure of books, and not just sit and wait for the author to hand me a plot that moves along to a resolution as quickly as possible. This is not that kind of book. The plot does move along, but at a slower pace than normal, because there is description and small scenes that just deepen the books' universe, but are not central to the plot. It is meant to be enjoyed as an experience at a slow upward slope, not just be a fast paced trek up to the climax. Don't get me wrong-- there is LOADS of excitement and suspense. It's just that there are other things, too.<br /><br />So, in a nutshell, if you are the kind of person that really ONLY enjoys books with only a few plot lines that build quickly, like Harry Potter, Hitchhiker's Guide, Thursday Next or even Mistborn, to a degree (I am not insulting these books-- I love all of them. They are just different), you should probably steer clear of this series. If you liked LOTR, Sword of Truth, or Wheel of Time, though, you will LOVE A Song of Ice and Fire.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a fun game. I enjoyed it. Didn't have any problems on my HTC EVO. I will probably play pretty often.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this game is super cool, love the graphics, this version runs great on the kindle fire and looks sweet. don't waste $4 more for the kindle fire edition
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoy the variety and the challenge of simple short games. Would recommend it to friends. love unlocking new games. Have played for hours.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this take on the classic game of missile command.  make those upgrades count you will need them for the later levels!
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I bought this with great excitement. I was super anxious to begin reading since it seemed right up my alley: a 19/20th century goth murder/mystery novel set in the Victorian Ages. Not so much. This is the second book I have read by P.D. James and the 2nd time I have been disappointed. The first book of hers I read, \\"The Private patient\\" and I felt the same. It fell flat. I wanted to give this book another chance since the genre James writes in is my wheelhouse, but was sourly disappointed. It was just a much anticipated very disappointing read. No more James for me anymore I'm afraid.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Just some good old fun an updated version of Missle Command. I used to love that game on my Atari.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|we love it! my 2 year old son would watch this movie 5 times a day if I let him.
B005HS4CUY|1.0|These movies are great, but a ton of people are having issues with skipping and hang ups. I have had similar issues.  I bought a brand new samsung blu ray 3d player and this is the only disc collection I have ever seen skip. I do not recommend these.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game I found addictive, cause I wanted to beat all the games :-)  not as easy as I wanted.
067144901X|5.0|My daughter loves this book. We checke it out from the library and she had me read it 5 times a day so I bought her her own copy. It isn't as big as the book from the library but it takes up less room in my purse so that's ok with me!
1439170916|5.0|I was very pleased when I received this book.  It was in perfect condition and came just in time for Christmas.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I use this product to take digital audio from my television and covert it to analog which sends to to my amplifier.  For this purpose it works perfectly.  It has both optical and coaxial audio support, which really leaves your option open.  It is a DAC that just works well.  It probably is a niche product, but it is the perfect choice for those who need one.
0374275637|5.0|I am deeply skeptical of psychological studies that purport to extrapolate from the general to the particular as to human behavior.  I think that approach runs afoul of what Dr. Kahneman criticizes, substituting an easy answer for the hard question.  The whole analysis of prospect theory and loss aversion seems to me flawed in that respect.  We often resort to group averages to cover up our lack of understanding as to the physical reasons an individual brain operates the way it does.  Witness the alcoholic or the gambling addict, who pay no attention to loss aversion.<br /><br />When I was in college and took sociology and psychology courses, the joke on campus was that both disciplines could be described by the phrase: \\"The science of what everybody knows.\\"  Dr. Kahneman likes to say that the results of the experiments he describes are \\"surprises,\\" but I really don't think so.  From my perspective, using my, as Dr. Kahneman describes, System 1, I found most of the results of the studies he described as unsurprising and a match for my intuitive (counter-intuitive).  As another reviewer commented, Dr. Kahneman's studies are flawed in a few ways:  (a) they extrapolate from general averages to a particular; (b) he defines intuitive based on those averages, rather than on individual brain chemistry and how a particular individual may think; (c) he designs experiments on loss aversion that guarantee a certain result, because the students in the experiment do not get the benefit of the law of large numbers.  Having presented these criticisms, however, i think his book makes a valuable contribution to people who read it and want a better understanding of how most people think.<br /><br />The problem I have with Dr. Kahneman's approach is that it is a classic example of that in which he finds fault.  Substituting the easier, irrelevant question for the harder question.  Psychology experiments such as he cites are substitutes for an understanding of the physical brain functions that cause an individual to behave in a certain way.  Neither gambling addicts nor alcoholics nor serial murderers exhibit any loss aversion whatsoever.<br /><br />So, to cite one particular example, here is what I wrote the authors of a study Dr. Kahneman cites in support of loss aversion and his prospect theory.<br /><br />Dear Dr. Schweitzer and Dr. Pope:<br /><br />I read with interest your study after reading Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow.<br /><br />I have some questions/observations that I would very much appreciate your comments.<br /><br />By way of background, I have been a trial lawyer for 40 years and have a substantial interest in human behavior and loss aversion and related concepts of risk.<br /><br />After reading your article I remain a bit skeptical about the connection between your results and loss aversion, at least insofar as the latter is viewed as non-rational. I should admit I have a bias against psychological or any kind of group behavior that attempts to establish a causative link with individual behavior, but having admitted my bias, I have the following to say:<br /><br />1.  Did your study examine the statistical comparison in the last nine holes of a tournament by a tournament leader who is ahead by four strokes or more, or any other number in the lead.  Since, for example, the odds of the second place player proceeding to four under par for the last nine holes seems low, might it not be rational for the leader to avoid bogeys, regardless of whether putting or conservative play in general is concerned.<br /><br />2.  Some golfers (perhaps many) are leads concerned about winning than ending up in the money.  The tour is replete with examples of top annual money winners having won few if any tournaments.  For those golfers who are not intensely interested in winning, their putting may be differently motivated.<br /><br />3.  I'd be interested if you looked at the following correlations:<br /><br /> a.  Percentage record in your study by individual golfer versus wins and where they finished on the money list;<br /><br /> b.  The individual golfer's putting performance as related to drives in fairway, or greens in regulation;<br /><br /> c.  None of the statistics currently promoted by the PGA, e.g. drives in fairway, sand saves, putting, greens in regulation, etc. seem to correlate well with winnings.<br /><br />4.  I noticed that some of the golfers with the lowest percentage difference in your study were relatively unsuccessful in winning tournaments, e.g. Sergio Garcia, Justin Leonard, John Daly, where Tiger Woods with a fairly high or average percentage was the top winner by far until a couple of years ago.<br /><br />5.  As in football turnover ration is there a correlation between the putting percentages you found and winning.  In football, there is a high cost to pay for turnovers (in field position, lost opportunity to score, for example), which may be the reason coaches stress the importance of avoiding risk by engaging in less aggressive play (carrying the ball with one hand enhances the runner's ability to avoid tackles or)<br />the longer the pass, perhaps the greater chance for an interception or conversely, the greater chance for a big gain).<br /><br />6.  A golfer, as a young player, often participates mostly in match play.  This may \\"train\\" the player to think in terms of avoiding bogeys at all cost.<br /><br />7.  Did you analyze the casual player, who is not playing competitively.  He may be more aggressive in trying for birdies.  Your acknowledgment that the percentage difference declines in the last two rounds seems to indicate what I would call the \\"match play\\" mindset, because birdies may become more important during the last two rounds as having a larger psychological effect on a competitor who sees the birdie on the scoreboard from a close competitor.<br /><br />8.  Downhill putts are generally considered more difficult than uphill putts; did you analyze those statistics.  Your division of the green in segments may be to broad.<br /><br />9.  Golfers often say that putting past the hole offers a better chance of making the next putt, because they immediately see the correct line. Does your study contradict that approach?<br /><br />10.  Is the prospect theory of loss aversion undermined, at least a little, by the relative lack of success that appears to come to an aggressive player, e.g. Phil Mickleson's early relative lack of success, until he played more conservatively.  Is there a relationship between the high percentage putt players and conservative play in general?

Is there a relationship to examine between the leader after two rounds and the ultimate winner?<br /><br />I have other similar observations, but I suppose the ones above are all based on wondering whether you should take into account each golfer's overall play before deciding whether a particular birdie vs. par putting percentage is consistent with loss aversion theory in general?<br /><br />Thank you in advance for reading this email.  I certainly found Dr. Kahneman's book and studies and your own study as thought provoking.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Herb Beigelormance as related to drives in fairway, or greens in regulation;   c.  None of the statistics currently promoted by the PGA, e.g. drives in fairway, sand saves, putting, greens in regulation, etc. seem to correlate well with winnings.  4.  I noticed that some of the golfers with the lowest percentage difference in your study were relatively unsuccessful in winning tournaments, e.g. Sergio Garcia, Justin Leonard, John Daly, where Tiger Woods with a fairly high or average percentage was the top winner by far until a couple of years ago.  5.  As in football turnover ration is there a correlation between the putting percentages you found and winning.  In football, there is a high cost to pay for turnovers (in field position, lost opportunity to score, for example), which may be the reason coaches stress the importance of avoiding risk by engaging in less aggressive play (carrying the ball with one hand enhances the runner's ability to avoid tackles or)  the longer the pass, perhaps the greater chance for an interception or conversely, the greater chance for a big gain).  6.  A golfer, as a young player, often participates mostly in match play.  This may \\"train\\" the player to think in terms of avoiding bogeys at all cost.  7.  Did you analyze the casual player, who is not playing competitively.  He may be more aggressive in trying for birdies.  Your acknowledgment that the percentage difference declines in the last two rounds seems to indicate what I would call the \\"match play\\" mindset, because birdies may become more important during the last two rounds as having a larger psychological effect on a competitor who sees the birdie on the scoreboard from a close competitor.  8.  Downhill putts are generally considered more difficult than uphill putts; did you analyze those statistics.  Your division of the green in segments may be to broad.  9.  Golfers often say that putting past the hole offers a better chance of making the next putt, because they immediately see the correct line. Does your study contradict that approach?  10.  Is the prospect theory of loss aversion undermined, at least a little, by the relative lack of success that appears to come to an aggressive player, e.g. Phil Mickleson's early relative lack of success, until he played more conservatively.  Is there a relationship between the high percentage putt players and conservative play in general? (But see John Daly-aggressive- vs. Justin Leonard-conservative)  Or, does aggressive play from tee to green correlate with conservative play on the green?  11.  Is there a relationship to examine between the leader after two rounds and the ultimate winner?  I have other similar observations, but I suppose the ones above are all based on wondering whether you should take into account each golfer's overall play before deciding whether a particular birdie vs. par putting percentage is consistent with loss aversion theory in general?  Thank you in advance for reading this email.  I certainly found Dr. Kahneman's book and studies and your own study as thought provoking.  Sincerely,  Herb Beigel
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Before I bought this, I bought another Tenth Doctor's Sonic screw driver. This is bigger than that I bought before. At first, I want to buy this but it didn't shipped outside of U.S. So I gave up and bought another. But this is more unique, useful so I like this more!  Once you input 3 batteries inside, it lights on and UV ink glows(this sonic can change black-pen or UV ink pen). It was very interesting and my sister loved this:)  Another, when you light on, it sounds like The Doctor's sonic screw driver! This sounds is quite impressive.

0385523912|5.0|I received this book for Christmas and it is one of the best gifts that I have ever received. Instead of being loaded with facts, statistics, and reports like most books about North Korea, this book gets to the kind of information that Westerners like me really want: biographies. It was the biographical elements on which this book is based that makes it so captivating; it was hard for me to believe that the stories in this story were not only horrifying and heart-breaking, but also true and in no way fictional. The only drawbacks would also be a plus, which is a relative exclusion of facts, figures, and statistics in this book, with the latter only used as a supplemental aid to understanding the stories. If you are looking for a chilling but ultimately joyous tale of doubtful DPRK citizens who were brave enough to follow their hearts to what was truly their home, then this is a good book for you. If you are looking for a CIA-like documentation of the DPRK and its citizens in general, don't buy this book. 5/5
B002ZG999U|1.0|Inconsistant, messed up, emotionless, scenarioless, very poorly scripted, filmed and edited. The dream cast did not deserve that. It feels like the actors were not together when they shot and that the shots were not prepared, first take in the box, shake the box when its full, add as much firework as you like ketchup on your burger, and here's your Editing. JCVD was well aware not to participate.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I live outside of U.S. but my area is Blu-ray's region A. So I have two options. One, is buying my country's Star Wars BD, or buying Amazon's Star Wars BD. Subtitles is very important matters because my first language is not English, but I chose Amazon because people said that this U.S. version has a good quality more than that.  Case is great! I almost died of this quality and BD and additional videos were also nice. Episode IV~VI's CGI additional was disappointed because I love original muffet Yoda verson's. But Overall, I am satisfied:)
B004SH40BQ|2.0|I bought this for use with my iPhone 4 and some bluetooth headphones.  Little did I know that iPhone 4 already has a bluetooth built in...so why was this marketed for the iPhone?  Hopefully I can return it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the only thing that will make this game better is when I can play it on my Windows Phone. I like the upgrades and rebuild options. Good game, good tribute to Missile Command.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This brings back so many memories. Love the upgrades! Made it to lvl 25! Go for speed and capacity upgrades! why does this freakin appstore require 20 word minimum?????
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love this app...would have rated a 5, but sometimes (not often) it takes awhile to update the city. Always accurate.
0316098515|4.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my daughter. It was recommended by a chef on his blog so thought it would suit her. She is passionate about food and restaurants. I couldn't have picked a better present!! just waiting for some samples now!!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. It's one you won't want to put down. The alliteration is amazing and the characters are identifiable.
B0015DROBO|2.0|The begining is a total bore, all the fiscal discourse left me cold. The worse though were the mucky sex bits. At my stage in life, I really don't care who sleeps with whom and I would rather not waste my time reading about characters sex lives over and over and over again.<br />I won't bother reading the other two books in this series. I feel this book was a waste of my time and money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it keeps you busy and the games is cool as far as being hard, well, not that hard to say the least.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love. this game ....NOT but owell I still play it and like it I mean its not the greatest in the world I think that. the creators could have done a little bit better.

1451627289|4.0|I'm a very long time reader and fan of Stephen King.  I consider \\"11/22/63\\" to be yet another in a generally reliable string of great stories from \\"the Master\\" -- it is not King's very best work but it is likewise very far from what I consider to be his worst work.  I give it a good solid B+ and would certainly recommend it to other King fans (and have done so!).
B0063IH60K|4.0|-1 star for the &quot;ads&quot;. The only ads I'm getting are promoting their other free games. Their FAQ says the ads are there for revenue, but I'm not seeing that. MobilityWare, get a clue and charge $0.99 for a premium version to get rid of these pointless ads that pop up prior to every game after you make your first move making me click on them even when I don't need to. I for one would pay to remove them, as the actual game play itself is amazing.
0525478817|5.0|You know, it's that awkward moment when you haven't read a book but you know that it's going to be amazing just because of the author. That's what I feel about John's books. When i first became a Nerdfighter i was like, 'ok so this dude also writes books apparently', I remember waiting a bit, watching the videos of the vlogbrothers to get an idea of the kind of man he is, and then he talked about Esther Earl and This Star Won't Go Out Fundation; well, that day, I got my mother in the deskroom and made her buy: Will Grayson, Will Grayson, Paper Towns, Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. I had never heard of these books, or read a summary, but somehow i knew, I felt that i would love them; and man i DID love them. So when he announced that a new book was about to be published i didn't hesitate and pre-ordered it without knowing the plot. For a few reasons I didn't get my copy and had to order another one; I haven't read the book yet, but i do know that i will love it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|With more depth and a more intricate scoring system than the original missile command, this will keep you entertained for quite a while. Highly recommended, definitely worth the buck.
B004LWZW24|4.0|Somewhere along the line horror movies went from atmospheric, spooky tales to blood & guts fests in order to get you scared.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a bit of blood in my horror movies, but I love just good old fashioned creepy stories that don't rely on excessive carnage & violence to get you creeped out.   I wasn't expecting a lot from this movie and my husband and I both came away thinking it was pretty darned good.    The premise is a young couple who move into a large home with their infant and two young sons.  Things start to happen in the house and the family decides the house has got to be haunted, as their are strange sounds, and it seems there are others in the house when there isn't anyone there.  One of the sons begins to draw strange and demonic pictures and he writes that he seems himself sleeping and then flies away.  The makings of a unique imagination or something else????  The mother is so unnerved but the unexplained things that she is experiencing that she is more than happy to ditch the grand house for a much smaller one to start fresh.  Early on the one son, who has been making the strange drawings is exploring and finds his way to the attic and the creaky old ladder snaps a rung and Dalton falls and hits his head.  Things seem ok until the next day when his father cannot wake him and they go to the hospital.  The doctors cannot explain it, he is not in a coma, but he is not in a wakeful state either, he is in limbo and they don't know when/if he will come out of it.  He returns home with a hospital-type setup and is fed through a tube and they wait..... Meanwhile strange things begin to happen in the new house, enough that they begin to think that this house too is haunted....doors that were locked open, a record played changes to a tune that is not on the album being played, people start to see figures and hobby horses rock on their own.   The movie is spooky and then when you find that the son is actually the haunted one, it is strangely compelling-A psychic and her crew of two come to check out the house and see what they may be able to do to help rid the home and the couple's son of their demons.   I enjoyed the spooky chills, the creepy cinematography and the plotline.    Overall, a good movie if you like a good old fashioned scare.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|easy and fun points are also easy to acquire. some games can be challenging but you will eventually master them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter bought these books for the Kindle and I have to admit it took some convincing to get me to start reading them.  I fell in love with the characters and plot and couldn't stop reading once I started.  This is one of those series that draws you in and refuses to let you go until you come to the end.  Of course when you come to the end you have to read the next book in the series because you just have to know what happened next.  Suzanne Collins has become a favorite author after this incredible series of books.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|ok game, but can argue several sets on which one doesn't belong. would be nice if they had clearer reasons...
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|We purchased this for our 10-year-old daughter for Christmas. She read the book and very much enjoyed it. The movie did not disappoint and gave us great opportunities to discuss adversity, suffering, perspective, family, friendship and faith. Highly recommend.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|As a die hard Modern Family fan, I wanted to get this along with all the other seasons DVD's.  It has been awhile since I had seen some of these older episodes and they did not disappoint.  I had forgotten how funny they are!  Love everything Modern Family, this included! My sister and her husband have never watched Modern Family over so we had them over to watch some of the episodes with us and they can't wait to come back and watch some more! I would recommend these to anyone who wants to watch something and have a good laugh! You can't go wrong!

B0029LHWFO|5.0|There are not many books I can read straight through, but I couldn't put this one down. Through all the highs and lows no matter how big or how small, I felt like I was right there alongside him on his journey. Such an ability is the testament of every great writer, and he certainly falls in that category with this autobiographic effort.  His life reads like the stuff of great cinema from humble beginnings to now President and chief of the greatest country on earth. It's a true triumphant story. I highly recommend it not only to learn more about our current President, but perhaps you may learn a little more about yourself in the process.

145162445X|5.0|Having read \\"Fear of Physics\\" - I was very much looking forward to this publication.  Mathematics (not being my strong suite) has challenged me in reading similar works by other authors.  However - Krauss is a master at explaining concept so those 'not-so-mathematically-inclined' individuals such as myself can easily follow along (my struggle with complex mathematics hasn't hindered my interest in understanding the concepts provoking it's need).  Krauss readily states (more than once) that research is only as good as the data (sample size etc. as well as the tools available to achieve them).  Based on what has been discovered to date - he's painted a conceptual picture of the beginning of the universe / our relative state within it / as well as what's in store for us in the future - while still admitting there are many questions that have yet to be answered.  Having seen some of his presentations online and subsequently experiencing his quick-wit (or dry to some I suppose - yet - with none-the-less) I very much look forward to the same within his writing.  I wasn't disappointed.  Perhaps a bit more subtle than his video presentations online but - I suppose it's important to remember that he's not writing a fictional comedy.  I very much appreciated this book... I found it incredibly thought provoking - more so than any other similar I've read in the past.  If anything - it urges to the surface what's really important... That is - our time is limited.... and - all the garbage/politics and religious provoked stupidity that occur daily here on our planet is such a waste.  Many thanks to Mr. Krauss for this book.  I look forward to future publications and - highly recommend others pick this up for a read.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought these headphones to temporary replace the one that's on a fritz and these are actually pretty decent. There are mad comfortable. The plush cushions are better than the leather ones on my DJing headphones. After a while, these does not hurt your ear nor does it hurt taking them off. Cord so far is long enough for you to move around, unless you're trying to walk around the house with it. Tried the mic on skype's test call and i got a minor buzz that's really unnoticeable. Especially when you in-game, you don't hear it at all. It probably was just interference from another device at the time.  For $25, I would definitely recommend this to all my fellow gamers.  To bad the clear red plastic parts does not light up. Would have been neat aesthetically.  ...[02/09/12] and i think the sub just went out.

0062060554|5.0|I won't recap the story as many reviewers do.  You can read that on the book jacket.  What I will say, after reading many of the positive and negative reviews of this book, is that I couldn't put it down from the first page!!  The writing moved along smoothly and kept me engaged.  The suspense built, keeping me sufficiently hooked.  And the ending was a surprise.  That said, many reviewers were critical about the holes in the story that were difficult to fathom.  Others complained about the repetition of the character's daily awakenings of blankness and reviews of her journal entries.  I found that to be part of the build-up.  The day after day after day of the same.  But to her, it's not monotonous.  Each day is a new day, starting from scratch.  Reading her journal is like reading a novel for the first time.  And come on, folks, it's a work of FICTION!!!!  I loved this book and can't wait to see what the author comes up with next!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Truly a blessing and convenience.  Finally I have been able to catch up on my readings again.  Thanks for the great app.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Now, a lot of the people who gave this film a negative review accused the film of things such as: too many cliches or being too predictable, or even being boring, nothing could be further from the truth,  I assure you.  If you're looking for a romantic comedy to vegetate in front of, this isn't your movie, however in your case, I'd recommend \\"Hitch.\\"  If you're willing to think, you'll find this movie to be fantastic.  It's not filled with cliches, and I refuse to believe otherwise for sheer lack of compelling evidence of any cliches at all within the film.  Now, is it going to be completely original?  No, but nothing is.  Anyway, enough rambling.    The plot centers around Gil, a struggling writer, who is visiting Paris with his fiance.  Gil longs to live in the Paris that existed in the 1920s; one of his fiance's friends refers to that as \\"golden age thinking\\" this is crucial to the message of the film.  Shortly after arriving in Paris, Gil takes a walk in an effort to formulate ideas for a novel, and finds himself standing in an empty Paris street, at midnight.  A 1920s model of whatever car (they mention it in the film) pulls up and whisks Gil away to the Paris of his dreams.  Throughout the story Gil meets people such as: Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Cole Porter, and a woman whose dream is to live in 1890s Paris.  Soon enough Gil and this woman are whisked away to 1890s Paris where he meets more notable characters (I apologize, for not remembering all of their names) who all wish to live in past eras themselves.  The woman Gil is with, wants Gil to stay there with her, never going back to the 20s.  This is where Gil learns, that the number off the year is not what makes an era great, but that the people who live in an era are what make it great.  That's the message of the film, that and obviously: follow your dreams, as it's Gil's dream to write and live in Paris.  Anyway, just to wrap up the story, Gil returnsto Paris, calls off his wedding so that he can live and write in Paris, and then meets a new woman.    I didn't see many problems with the script; there are some pointless references to the tea party movement and the right wing in general, which Woody seems to have included simply for, well no reason at all, hence my labeling it a pointless reference.  Also when references like that are made the acting reduces itself to a kind of text-to-speech quality; in other words, I'm just not convinced that the characters actually believe these things.  The Hemingway character comes on just a little strong in the beginning, indicating a slight bout of overacting.  Kathy Bates was excellent, Adrian Brody was excellent (I've got no idea why some people are railing against his performance) and Owen Wilson, despite a few bumps, was fantastic.  All in all a great film, but remember, watch it; don't just gloss over the surface and expect yourself to get it, you won't.
0525478817|5.0|This book is beautiful and sad, but the important difference is it's not beautiful because it is sad. This book is also realistic in dealing with life and death in a scientific sense, hopeful in demonstrating a humans will to live even in a world full of suck, funny, wry and tragic.  It's full awesomeness is hard to describe. The language is amazing, it flows nicely, the plot is fun and heartwrenching.  (This is NOT a \\"downer\\" book. It did make me sad to think about my own family if they had to go through what these kids did).   And, sorry John Green, I cant help but picture Hazel as Esther.   P.S. I got a green J-Scribble!

0060873027|2.0|Michael Crichton's posthumous \\"Micro\\" was disappointing.  I don't know if this is because co-author Richard Preston didn't know how to take what Crichton had done with the unfinished manuscript, or if it just wasn't that good to begin with.  (I've not researched any more than the jacket cover saying the \\"majority\\" of the book had been written prior to Crichton's death--I didn't want that knowledge of who wrote what to cloud my judgment.  But after writing this review, I found that Wikipedia says Crichton had completed 1/3 of it.)  The idea of shrinking humans (and other items) certainly isn't a new concept.  Most of the book's action seems to be a result of the authors' wondering \\"what would happen if a human in the `micro-world' ran up against an ant, a mosquito, a wasp, etc.\\"<br /><br />A new corporation, Nanigen, in Hawaii is shrinking humans to better explore the rainforests for pharmaceutical research.  Peter Jansen and his fellow biology grad students are recruited to help the company by Peter's brother Eric and CEO Vin Drake.  But when Eric is apparently killed, Peter and his cohorts travel to Hawaii to find out what's going on.  They're inadvertently shrunk and left to fend for themselves in the micro-world.  Most of the characters are annoying, the science dubious and rather silly at best (which is very un-Crichton-like), and the action redundant.<br /><br />I loved Crichton's first posthumous book \\"Pirate Latitudes\\" but he'd completed that novel.  \\"Micro\\" was just a mess.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this.is a really fun game! I love it!! there are some games for little kids that are really easy! I don't know why people.talk about an update cud I didn't get one so what Eva!

B00133KHCY|5.0|This movie didn't get the media hype it should have.  It is joyful, uplifting, and incredible.  From the story line, to the directing and flow of the movie and to the acting.  Entertaining and thrilling especially if you have a love for music.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is the first series that I've seen from BBC, and let me tell you: it did not disappoint! The superb acting is matched only by the writing and effects, and the chemistry between Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively) lends the series a realism that sucks you in and makes you root for them from the first minute. Although set in the 21st century, this series stays faithful to the canon, with details that any true Sherlock Holmes fan will appreciate. You will want to watch them again and again. It will definately be worth the money, once it's available.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great! some of the games are really hard, but its all apart of the fun. its really addicting!!

0486284735|5.0|I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary.<br /><br /> The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?
0553573411|3.0|I loved the first book (Assassin's Apprentice), I guess I should have stopped there.  This book provided some interesting perspectives on the power struggle and the lives in a keep.  But it also really showed how frustratingly inept the protagonist is as an assassin.  For a book with such title, I would expect there be more about assassination in stealth.  My biggest complaint though is that this book is not self contained. So many issues were not resolved in the book's ending that you are almost forced to read the 3rd book.
B004Q1FDHO|5.0|the game is awesome but how do I get to other places THE BIRDS ARE ANNOYING- why does he have to spend his money all the time,HE NEEDS TO SAVE HIS MONEY!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game to play when u r bored. I couldn't. stop playing it. I don't. understand why so many people posted negitive reviews.
B00000IQV7|5.0|delivery, quality, speed.....all good.  I would recomend buying from this user.  Price was also very competative.  I give it an A+ experience.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|It is always nice to get a free app. it is really nice to get one that works this well.
0064440346|5.0|I ordered a kids book, which teaches children to read, pretty late but it was sent in time for Christmas! Excellent work!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I saw this many times, and passed it over. I now regret that. This is a well put together puzzle game, with zen music. very enjoyable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had no idea that I would ever be into \\"Young Adult\\" literature, especially with all of the comparisons that this series got to Twilight which I know I have no interest in, but I decided to give the Hunger Games a shot.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  I read all 3 books twice because I enjoyed them that much.<br /><br />I'd recommend to anyone, any age.
1451627289|5.0|I'm not generally a reader of science fiction or horror but when this book made it to the top slot on the New York Times bestseller fiction list, I figured I'd give it s shot. Our library had it on 7 day loan. Could I read this monster (849 pages) in that time frame? Indeed I did ... because the tale was captivating engrossing. King weaves a hundred tales into this book and manages to tie up all the loose ends. In fact, a number of times the twists really made me smile at his uncanny ability. Coming from a non-fiction reader, I can say the book is well worth the read.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|I love these movies and this was a great price for a Blue ray version.  The whole family enjoyed it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Awesome game, simple concept and easy controls. Fun and challenging. I would recommend this game. I need to write a few more words..
014312093X|5.0|This is an absolutely phenomenal read--a true page turner!  In a nutshell, it tells the story of one man (George Smiley) rooting out the mole (spy) in British intelligence during the Cold War.  I first heard about it on NPR, and felt compelled to pick it up for myself.  Very glad I did!  The writing is crisp, the story is unbelievably interesting, and the resolution is simply perfect.  Reading it has made me very keen to check out the BBC miniseries!
0811870413|5.0|This is a wonderfully illustrated and instructional book, which makes achieving professional quality bread results at home!!! A \\"must have\\" for everyone who loves GOOD home-made bread, but has not been successful at the home level!!
0515141429|5.0|This continues the Jack Reacher story that begins with the recently published \\"The Affair\\". Continuity is good, not too much extraneous page-filler. The characters are well defined & fit well with the story being told. Villains are villainous, good guys are not overly good.
B005QBKXOQ|3.0|I like the idea that he is trying out new ideas for his music. A few trac's had me tapping my foot to the beat, but some of the other trac's make me think he should keep looking. The man has talent for sure. His first cd was mostly hit material. Thae last two will do good to produce more than one hit each.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is by far my favorite Bible app. Its easy to use. my favorite features are book marks and highlights.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We purchased this my wife's grandmother who loves Sound of Music.  She only recently got blu-ray and a large flat-screen, so I was dying to see how things looked all together (and force her to use it at least once while we were there). ;)  We put it in, and I was floored.  The image quality is fantastic.  In fact, it's almost too good at times- almost looks fake.  But- I think this was ultimately due to the settings she had on her flat-screen.  [Someone pumped it up to vivid settings with extra sharpness I believe.]  However, even with the settings not optimal (or rather as I'd prefer them), it was obvious that this release was the best in video quality out there.  Colors and textures were clean and clear- not muddy.  I remember watching it late-night on the old TV and it was horrible quality compared to this.  Almost like you're in the movie-theater watching it's release.  Fantastic!
0007448058|5.0|A mesmerizing tale, beautifully written - the descriptive portions are as good as seeing a movie -can't wait to see it on DVD. Although I despise the authors whose stories are comprised of many story lines & characters, this seems to be the only way to weave the overall story together.<br /><br />It would have been helpful if there had been a glossary of the ancient weapons & tools mentioned, with illustrations, where possible.<br /><br />I did NOT like the unpronounceable names of characters & places. It was so unnecessary, in my opinion.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|Good sound. I like this cd. It has a lot of good stuff, done well, and has that classical Nickelback sound and style. Much better than 'Dark Horse', but 'All The Right Reasons' still rocks best with Silver Side Up tunning a close second.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is one of the most useful apps ever that everyone should get or just read the real bible
0439023513|5.0|Similar to my thoughts on Catching Fire, I was a bit bored and disappointed with how long it took to get to the heart of the storyline.  I didn't care much for all of the weaponry and training that Katniss had to go through in the beginning, but I guess it was crucial to the storyline going forward.  However, once I was 30% through, I read it at every free moment I got.  The story is enthralling, exciting, heartbreaking, suspenseful, and surprising.  There is also an epilogue which I believe was a great way to end the story.  I was an avid Harry Potter reader and, though most would disagree with me, the epilogue in Deathly Hollows was C-O-R-N-Y and contrived.  I appreciate that the HG epilogue was not this way at all.  After I was finished reading, I cried for about 10 minutes because it was all over.
0307949508|5.0|It is a slow read at first, but the character development in the beginning is well worth it.  It is a book for people who like stories that just seem to keep evolving and keeps you trying to guess what will happen next.  Love it.
B00008ADPF|4.0|I bought the 3 latest cd's before I got this one. It's a good example of their early stuff and a really good sound. For me it was an excelent prequel to music I had already come to like. If you don't already have this cd in your collection it is worth getting.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|One of the best games I have played on the fire.  Developers did a nice job on this one.  Def recommend.
0439023491|5.0|Perhaps I was a bit spoiled by the first book, but I was a little upset by how long it took to get to the crux of the story.  I also felt the timeline was a bit strange, being that the very beginning of the book dragged on a bit while almost the entire victory tour was summed up in what felt like a paragraph.  Nevertheless, as soon as the talk of the Quarter Quell comes up, you can't put it down.  Everything in the second half makes up for any shortcomings in the beginning.  I also loved all of the new characters that were introduced in this book and made me even more invested in the outcome.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Best game ever! I can't believe it's FREE! I love it,it's so much fun!This is the only game I even play!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well thanks for clicking my review.I first had gotten introduced to The Hunger Games by my Language Arts teacher.He never finished the book in class by reading it aloud.So,i decided to read it over the Summer last year.BOY was I glad I did!At first,I wasn't THAT impressed.Then,they got to the reaping.That was when I got hooked on the book.Many people would think that putting teens in an arena in kill eachother is disgusting.DO NOT MISJUDGE THIS BOOK!That is the beauty of this book.You never know what will happen next.This is my favorite book of all time!The suspence,the action,the romance!Way better than those TwiLOSERS!That was just my opinion.But when I finished the trilogy,I was sad that Ms.Collins was not going to write another book.But,I found out about the MOVIE.And Josh Hutcherson was going to play PEETA!HAPPINESS!I love Haymitch and his drunk self.Especially when he throws up on himself and Katniss and Peeta have to clean him up.(That was also kind of gross)I just hope there won't be a \\"Team Peeta \\" \\"Team Gale\\" fiasco.(But for the record,I would be Team Peeta.Gale is a square.><)Overall,The Hunger Games is a fantastic read  I totally recommend this to anyone ages 10&up.*HATERS SHALL BE PUT IN THE ARENA NEXT!*   P.S This is my first review.    Thanks and..............    May this book,be EVER in your favor!^^
0307949508|4.0|I give Mr. Larsson this: his books are fast reads, well thought out and intriguing. Too bad he won't write any more.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\" is a strong followup to \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", answering many of the questions left lingering from the first book (like how Lisbeth came to be declared mentally incompetent and where her violent tendencies came from). There isn't a big mystery this time round, unless it's the question of who Zala is. Certainly obvious who committed the three murders, and to me the question of Zala wasn't that hard to figure out either. There is one rather odd twist towards the end, perhaps thrown in to really throw the readers but it just came too far out of nowhere for me, and really doesn't seem believable. Perhaps in the third book, which I have yet to read, it's explained and makes sense. I won't say what so I don't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet. It doesn't spoil the book or the ending. And I do recommend reading it, regardless of that twist.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a bit far-fetched as a character, I mean seriously - if she spends so much time working on her fighting skills and everything else she does, when did she have the time to become such a phenomenal hacker? Although she does come across as the female counter to so many male action heroes. Guys like Dirk Pitt, who seemingly can do everything with expertise. And she is interesting, unlike her ally Mikael Blomkvist who seems so cliched as to be ridiculous. As even some of the characters in the story note! How humorous that in the movie he's played by Daniel Craig. I wonder if the director intended that bit of irony?<br /><br />I do have one serious objection, although I wonder if it isn't a translation issue. At a number of points in the story, a number of Lisbeth's friends/allies call her a moral person. A moral person doesn't commit robbery or attempt murder. I'm not saying she isn't a good person, nor am I saying that the people she robs, blackmails, or attempts to kill don't perhaps deserve what she does to them. But moral? Not by Western standards, certainly. I'm hoping that this is a translation error, that when the novels were translated to English that the wrong word was chosen.<br /><br />Now, on to \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" to see how the ends left hanging at the end of this book are tied up.l don't perhaps deserve what she does to them. But moral? Not by Western standards, certainly. I'm hoping that this is a translation error, that when the novels were translated to English that the wrong word was chosen.  Now, on to \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" to see how the ends left hanging at the end of this book are tied up.
0439023521|5.0|I have never reviewed ANYTHING but felt that this book (and the series overall) was deserving. I am not in the minority when I say this book was fantastic.  I do not enjoy stories that drag on and are bloated with subliminal themes and messages, so if you DO then this might not be the book for you.  The book starts very quickly and as soon as you get to the games, you can't put it down.  Any reviewer who is saying the storyline/theme is a copy off of this, that, and another thing may be completely valid, but that does not mean it is any less exciting.  It's also worth trying because if you end up not liking it, it's a quick read so you won't have wasted a lot of time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the challenge it gives. Great for all ages! I play along side my husband who plays on the laptop and we compete and spend time together
1932100660|5.0|This book makes a compelling case for the elimination of animal products from our diet and of virtually guaranteeing health through a plant based diet. The author provides scientific facts and research that will convince even the most ardent sceptics.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game provides lots of varity and is really cool it works great on my kindle fire my brother love it
0385535139|4.0|My mother is probably John Grisham's #1 fan so when he releases a new one she gets it as a gift which was the case with this. I can't really review the content, but the recipient of this book was super pleased.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I was very impressed with this item and would buy from this seller again and again. I was skeptical getting something that was \\"new\\" so cheap, but it came sealed packaging and all!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This should be standard on any weather app. Everything else seems really nice and looks sharp. But the lack of radar makes this app substandard.
0060899220|4.0|I personally love Anthony Bourdain's sense of humor.  I thought the book was a fun read and was better than I expected.  It was entertaining and gave you a better glipse of the man behind the show.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Very good app, Its easy to use &amp; works great, however, it wont really play videos, ( invalid video id always comes up) but other than that its a wonderful video &amp; mp3 downloader . I recommend it :3
1416550550|1.0|what an insult to the reader. an immature book, by an immature authour written for immature readers, level 13-16 years old. Dreaming for dreamers who want to escape reality. Made up weekly magazine novel dragged out to more than 500 pages. Very few qualities. Avoid!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|i like the game, but ocassionally when i finish a level, it wont continue.  im just left with a game the refuses to pull up a menu or anything.  this has happened twice, once on level 6, so i started a new game and it happened on level 4.  droid 2
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game platform. helps with hand and eye coordination. always fun and positive feedback from the games themselves. you learn that you have skills that you didn't know you had.
B003V4ASV8|5.0|An utterly compelling read, this is the story of ordinary people in the most extraordinary circumstances. Demick's study takes in the stories of a number of different people with very different lives, yet united by having eventually escaped the oppressive regime. But they all know others - often family members - who have fared less well. I hope that North Korea might open up in my lifetime, but for now, this is the closest I'm likely to get to a visit.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Im a big nickel back fan and this was my favorite cd of theirs. Gotta be somebody is the lead single but only one of at least eight stellar songs on this album. Must get for nickel back fans, and most others who like this style of music.
B005XY67WI|5.0|Shakira is the best female performer on the planet period! she just so much different from the american singers, so much better. Get this blu-ray you will love it.
B003K16P3M|4.0|In the tradition of Hunger Games, Divergent and several other recent YA books, Graceling tells the story of a strong but emotionally damaged young woman.  Katsa is graced with superb fighting skills and is employed by her king to use those skills at his command. Eventually, she leaves him to use the same skills to better her world along with Po, another graced fighter.  A quick fantasy read that is quite enjoyable and better written than some similar books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|A fun game that you can sit down and play while relaxing. Never a waste of your time. Never ending fun.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Este producto llego en poco tiempo en muy buenas condiciones y la pelicula ni que decir es lo mejor de cine mundial!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|good game n not hard after first couple lvls like some Ppl said just need good reflexes after a few lvls just protect two buildings
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game reminds me of old puzzle games like box-it. I am obsessed with getting each puzzle in the least amount of moves. Easy to navigate. Great game.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|this app is amazing! as a guitar player who received his guitar 2 days ago, this app really gotme going on guitar. has an enourmous selection for guitarist's, bass guitarist's, or drummers. there is also chord music in addition to tabs. I don't know what the kindle fire reviewer is talking about, the favorites option works fine on my fire. I love the advanced search feature, where you can narrow down your search by difficulty, instrument, and other categories. the chords music have an awesome feature: it shows you how to play each chord easiest, and like 30 other ways. some songs have a feature where you can play the song inside the app. there is also a top 100 tabs list (which I love for thinking of new songs to learn), and a auto-scroll feature for the lengthy songs. all in all, the best app on my kindle fire, and the best 2.99 I have ever spent. if they polished it up, would be worth at least $20, if not much more. one nice feature to add would be the ability to print music. (not sure if u can make that work on the fire :p)
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game Play is Awesome!  Fun game, highly recommend. I thought eh, another missle cmd haha this game is fun, did I tell you how much fun this one is?! :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soooo fun if u like fun and challenging game then this is your type of game so ya get this game!!!!!!! please. its soooooooooo fun!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game to play it would be  better if they can add different types of missiles to buy, but fun to play.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Well worth the $, ran flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. Lots of fun, great adaptation of the old Missile Command, totally recommend.
0938045768|5.0|First I have to say that I don't write many reviews so for a book or product to motivate me to take the time to write is really something.  Second, while I realize that this book and the idea for it were born behind bars -- the essence of this book is just good fundamental information on body weight training with no frills and a lot of just good education bout the evolution of exercise and weight training in America.  Like for instance, I had no idea that the abdominal \\"crunch\\" that we all love to hate did not arise because of its value to our core strength, instead it was devised as a way for steroid junkies to pump up the external abdominal muscles \\"six pack\\" while not increasing their girth.  And so it is today we do mass crunches without much benefit to the whole body.<br /><br />The break down of each of the 6 Big exercises could not get more simple with  a 10 step progression to the ultimate fitness goals. This is no quick fix program -- you are talking a serious time commitment in terms of months and years of training potentially, however on the other hand it would be virtually impossible to injury yourself in the beginning of the program because it is slow your body's muscles, tendons and ligaments have time to adapt to the the added stress and difficulty of the routines.<br /><br />I literally started yesterday with the very first work out with one set of each exercise and while it was not taxing to perform I found myself noticing small muscles and areas that I normally don't feel working.  I hope people interested in body weight exercise (especially women) are not turned off by the macho image on the cover, and the whole prison allusion.<br /><br />This program is for any one and everyone who would like to ditch the dependance on a gym membership or exercise gimmick and start getting really strong the way we were meant to -- gradually and progressively over time.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As I said in the title, here is my new book addiction. GRRM has a excellent way with words that made up for the back and forth confusion as well as the never ending plot lines with no fullfillment. That is exactly what makes this book the beginning of a book addiction, you will be craving for more, well, after the first 100 pages at least. I enjoy the realism, the idea that any man can die and that good does not always triumph. Sometimes, bad things happen to good people and some times bad people are not always bad. There is depth and an understanding that people can connect with as long as they are not trying to find a book that will take them to a magical happyland.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun to waste time and when you have nothing better to do it is great I love trying to get the new games
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game play! Wish there was a save game (have a few save spots). No way to back out of the game without task manager. Get the inability to quit game will earn 5 *
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Highly addictive and great fun. It makes good use of your spacial recognition skills and helps build good strategy skills.
0785135863|3.0|I bought this book thinking it was a hardback of the original novel, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\".  It is a glorified comic book.  It follows the novel fairly closely but the length and story has been shorten to about 75 pages.  If you want to introduce your younger children to the \\"Ender\\" series of books this would be a good book to do so.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really entertaing had very addicting. lots of variety. some r really hard. I like this app. I would recommend. it to anyone and everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So the app is great overall. But what I most enjoy is the daily reading plans. I listen to the audio while I read, which really helps me focus. Plus I love the pop up reminders.  Its GREAT.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. It could use a little more variety and maybe a little more detailed graphics instead of basic shapes. Needs to be a little more &quot;human&quot; by introducing people or vehicles to the game instead of mechanical bombs and missiles that do only one thing. Other than that, it's a fun game to play when you are bored.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is cool I love it. I don't no wat those other people were talking about wen they said stuff like it was boring. they r stupid. there is a lot of variety. there is literally 117 games in it. that is like the only app you need on ur kindle for games. I think you should get this app.  Get it- NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game can be fun but it is really hard and that makes it hard for you to unlock more games
B0063GORYU|5.0|provides a challenge for card game fans. I'm still working on winning the four suit game, good luck and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and addictive. lots of games to play and unlock. great for when you have to wait for a long time.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the game to get. those other bad comments r stupid. this app doesn't need wifi.  I like this app a lot its free and who doesn't love angry birds!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using the YouVersion now for the last few weeks and it has helped me be more consistant in reading God 's Word. I even use it as my Bible in church.
B004UID2LC|5.0|best app ever!!! works great on kindle fire and quality is amazing (HD)  I recommend this if you want to download youtube videos and don't want to go through all the hassle. easy one step and ding! you got your video!! worth more than 5 stars!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game get this app its full of suprizes. Rate 5 stars this game deserves it would recommend to anyone who likes 2 have. fun with their apps
B005TQAI6G|5.0|I saw this tour twice in person, and it is just as amazing on dvd.  Britney is at her best performing many of her past hits and current ones as well.  The show is full of fun and exciting all the way through.  I can watch Britney dance and perform her music all night.  She even gives us a surprising little known song, Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, which is performed flawlessly and beautifully on a swing in the air.  One of the highlights for me.  The finale includes a fantastic cameo from opening act Nicki Minaj.  Definite must have dvd!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you should so get this game its awesome and it has more than one in it and its free so yea get this game
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think its ok but nredcvg gfgh thjjc gunfire. gghg ghgd Jd:* rsyjv dhjhcd ydtikhx gfyikyd gtyuifhjjvyyiii tfjgfd fghjj fghj tyj fyh tho fyh fun
0670022411|2.0|What a concept...witches, vampires, and demons that live among us.  Really could have delivered some great, edge on your seat reading but it never came.  I kept waiting and waiting. Instead, it was all just a set up for the author's next book in this series.  Save your money!
B005SZNZAY|4.0|This album is one of my absolute favorites of the year.  Chris Cornell has always sounded great as a headliner for his bands (Soundgarden and Audioslave) but on his own he shines.  The more familiar songs such as Fell On Black Days, I Am The Highway, Black Hole Sun sound amazing in this acoustic setting.    This is a must buy for any rock fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app does exactly what you want it to do. It can be a simple Bible app or you can take advantage of the reading plans and other features not found in other apps.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Classy, eye pleasing graphics, nice music, intelligent play, sensible step by step increases in difficulty. What's not to like? Best game programming I've seen. Runs perfectly on Kindle Fire.
B000BT97AO|5.0|This was a gift for a friend and she loved it! I'm not sure how often she watches it but I know she wanted it. The quality of the movie was great.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|Britney at her best!  This album is amazing!  There is literally not one weak track.  From start to finish it is full of club thumping hits.  Till The World Ends is destined to become a classic Brit hit.  She is especially fantastic on Criminal and bonus track He About To Lose Me.  I Wanna Go is another favorite.  You can't help but dance to the beat.    Britney proves she is still at the top of her game over a decade after she first hit the top of the charts with ...Baby One More Time.  Other current pop stars on the radio today may think they reign, but they will never have the staying power of this Femme Fatale!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This prequel was an excellently executed follow up to the Spartacus story that was delayed by Andy Whitfield's treatment for non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.  The series, while strongly violent and sexual, featured a strong story line, good acting, and did not seem like a forced back story following the great success of the initial series.  Much like Spartacus: Blood and Sand, Gods of the Arena had cheesy special effects, exclusively when it comes to gore, that eventually blend in and become a signature part of the show itself.  As in Blood and Sand Peter Mensah's acting is incredible.  I highly suggest this series to anyone, but would advise you to watch Spartacus: Blood and Sand before watching it--you will have many \\"a ha\\" moments as pieces of Blood and Sand's back story come together that you would not have if you watch Gods of the Arena first.  Great purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great it.keeps u going l, its really good. nothing i soul change about it. my favorit was the fish one with bubbles
B0064NTZJO|1.0|The title \\"driver\\" has almost nothing to do with the movie. It is mostly just blood and gore. If you like peoples veins split, nails driven through peoples head, forks driven in peoples body, torture, etc... then this movie is for you. I learned nothing from it.
0441013597|1.0|I don't mind paying a premium for a kindle version of a book. Well, I do a little. There is printing cost. That is not my problem with this book. It's the typos. Amazon needs to start hiring their own proofreaders or refusing to publish books with such a shoddy translation. I'm only about a quarter of the way through the book and I have seen lots of typos. If this were the bargain version of the book, I could accept it. I can't accept paying full price for an old book that the publisher didn't bother to reinvest enough in to make a decent version.
0465011047|5.0|I am a 45 yr old female born in the US and I have 2 young daughters.  I have read much about the WWII concentration camps in Germany and Russia but I have never read anything about them in current day North Korea.  I am so angered after having read Mr. Kang's life story - about the abuses he and his family suffered and probably still suffer with the horrific conditions even outside of the camps.  I want to march over to North Korea and grab everyone in power by the shirt collar and make the suffering stop.  I want to shout at the top of my lungs here in America so that something will get done NOW!  Everyone with the power to do something knows what is going on there yet nothing is done.  I know politics play the most part and it is infuriating to me.  We stormed over to Europe with some of our friends in the mid-forties and ended the concentration camps.  Then we shed tears and told the world of the abuses and inhumanities.  Here we have Mr. Kang telling us such stories that are happening today! and we sit still.  I have told my daughters some of Mr. Kang's life hardships and they understand their freedoms as best they can, but I hope it doesn't take until the next generation to save the children and people of North Korea.  I can recommend his book to everyone I know and talk to people about his story.  But I do not know what else to do to help his cause.  Can anyone make any suggestions for me?  Thank you.  And \\"THANK YOU\\" Mr. Kang for sharing your story at such a risk to yourself to help your fellow brothers and sisters in N. Korea.  Lisa Morehouse  lkmorehouse@yahoo.com
B005XQLBU4|3.0|It's an okay game if 2-D, stylized, sparse graphics are appealing to you. It many ways it's closer to the original Missile Command (its inspiration) than the more elaborate remakes but fact is that there ARE better remakes for Android tablets. My favorite (I am rating it 'awesome') happens to be [[ASIN:B005023UTG Warheads]] as a paid game or you may try before you buy by downloading [[ASIN:B0058DHSA4 Warheads FREE]].<br /><br />These being said, Missile Defender is a decent game. It's responsive to touch and allows you to budget your post-bombardment earnings between rebuilding those apartment buildings and upgrading your anti-missile defenses which is fine but I can't see that it's the kind of game that would make me want to play it over and over again.<br /><br />Amazon's rating for \\"it's Okay\\" is 3 stars so three stars it gets for a decent, bug-free, tablet-optimized game.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app.  The game is fun and you can make it harder as needed.  It loaded to my Fire with no problems and I have never had a problem.  You don't need to be connected to wifi to play the game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|love this game on my kindle fire! started with the free version &amp; upgraded to the full version &amp; it was really worth the price!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|love this game!! I get better each time. so glad it's the free app of the day!! take advantage while it's free!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The first time I got this app I thought it was bad because I didn't know that you can download the versions which in a way makes me love it even more. the only thing that could make it better is if you could download the new international version
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Perfectly suited for a touchscreen device.  I'm going to be playing this a LOT.  It reminds me of atomic bomber on the market.  I highly recommend this, buy it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|My all time favorite (*****) spider solitaire game came with my Windows Vista several years ago - unfortunately, when I moved to the MAC platform, I have NOT found a decent substitute.  This version is \\"pretty darn good\\"! It has multiple suits, hint, undo, and tells you when there are no more moves available. It also acknowledges 'up front', that not every game can be won! The only thing i really don't like about this version is that when you hit re-play deal (i.e., the same game) you lose your statistics for the streak you are on...that is pretty lousy. To retain those winning streak statistics going forward, you must keep \\"un-doing\\" ALL of the cards played right back to the beginning of the game. But compared to the MAC versions of the game (and I have pretty much tried them all) - this version is over all pretty darn good!!  NOTE to the app designer, could you please add this feature I've mentioned, and also consider adding different designs to the back of the cards?  Thanks!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my 25 year old boyfriend, and it didn't fit in his luggage and I have promised to mail it to him...just as soon as I can beat it! The is definitely challenging, and fun and frustrating and impossible to put down. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle games.
B004S4AU9A|5.0|I haven't been this in love with an album in over a decade!  I love every song, I love every lyric and I am in absolute awe of the quality the Foo Fighters continue to put out... seriously, how do they keep doing this?!  Maybe its because as I get older they are putting out what I WANT to hear?  But I have to think it isn't just successful brainwashing and sucking up that has my 13 year old son as stoked about them single after single, album after album... they just plan ROCK!  Buy this album, YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|this.is awesome and amazing  it has so much to it. its so fun. its so cool I could play it all day long.
B000JIJPZY|4.0|This is a very nice gym with lots of fun, engaging activities for baby. It plays music and has lots of textures and colors. We never found it too small, it was just right and didn't take up the whole living room. It was also easy to wash in the washing machine. Once my baby was older (7 months or so) she would pull the butterflies out of the tree because they're only attached with Velcro.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|this book was so fun to read! im 14 years old and if u dont like to read like me then your in luck with this one.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Margaret Thatcher is one of the towering historical figures of the 20th Century.  Despite humble origins, she rose to be the United Kingdom's first  female prime minister, and the longest serving prime minister of the 20th century. She took the reins of power in London at a time when the British economy had been decimated by decades of extremist Labor Party policies (anyone remember when Britain nationalized just about every possible industry driving the British automotive and motorcycle industries into the ground?).  Her policies brought the English economy from the depths of recession to dynamic growth. Arguably, she did as much as Ronald Reagan in leading the West to a bloodless victory in the Cold War. As a historical figure of such importance Margaret Thatcher deserves to be the subject of a great biographical film. The Iron Lady is not that film. In fact...Not only is The Iron Lady not a great movie, it's not even a particularly good movie.<br /><br />The Iron Lady seems to be very poorly structured. Not having read the book on which it's based I can't tell if the fault lies with the writing, the directing, or the source material. Here were have a movie about one of the most important historical movies of the 20th Century and at least 40 minutes of the movie seems to concentrate on Thatcher the elderly woman in the grips of dementia. We get to see her buying milk, going to the doctor, and hallucinating that her husband Dennis Thatcher is still alive. We get to see her finally clean out his closet and send all his clothes to Goodwill (or the British equivalent).  We get to see her daughter and staff worry about her and fuss over her. And this goes on and on.<br /><br />Watching this movie was an exercise in patience. I wanted to see a biopic that told the story of Margaret Roberts, the daughter of a humble shopkeeper who rose to be the most powerful female leader in the world. I wanted to see how she developed her political philosophy. I wanted to see how she dealt with crisis. But all these parts of her life were no more than touched on, and only then in flashbacks. Alexandra Roach did a great job playing the young Margaret Roberts, a shopkeeper's daughter who got accepted to Oxford University. I wanted to see a lot more of her. But every time that (or any) part of the story seemed to be getting interesting the flashback ended and the audience is taken back to modern day to watch a senile old woman argue with her dead husband. At another point one of her close friend is murdered by an IRA bomb, but do we get to see how she deals with this? No. Immediately the flashback ends and we're back to watching a senile old woman again. Every important moment depicted in the movies is presented the same way, as a short flashback, and totally out of context, that ends just as it's about to get interesting.<br /><br />The complete and utter failure of this movie may have a lot to do with the choice of Meryl Streep to play Thatcher. With such an A-list character actress as a leading lady, the director and writers structured the movie to highlight Streep's acting, not to highlight the life of the person Streep was portraying. That seems to be the only explanation for why we only got a see a couple moments of Alexandra Roach's wonderful portrayal of the young Margaret Roberts, and a tedious 40 plus minutes of Streep splaying a Thatcher as a senile old woman.<br /><br />All in all, The Iron Lady is a disappointing mediocre movie that fails as a biopic and fails as historical fiction. If you go in expecting a movie anywhere near as good as The King's Speech, you will be sorely disappointed. Hopefully, someday, someone will make a great biopic about Margaret Thatcher.t all these parts of her life were no more than touched on, and only then in flashbacks.

0312641893|2.0|The concept of reselling Cinderella in a futuristic setting appealed to me. The setting was quite vividly planned and the characters intrigued me. I started reading and I was hooked. I finished this book in 4 hours. For all the discriptions in this novel (and there were plenty), I couldn't completely visualize Cinder. I mean, we know she is a cyborg, but the constant revision of her hand and foot consistently threw me off. She's plain. Well how so? That annoyed me. Anyway... The prince was charming and appealing. The doctor, who was Cinder's modern day fairy god FATHER entertained me. I was enthraled. However, the book gets 2 stars for dragging on and on before self- confidence and self- awareness finally take hold of Cinder. This book had so much promise. Fun concept. Amazing  characters. I could go on... But the story failed to do what it set out to do. The author could easily have made this novel a series book, but allowed the story to continue following the doctor, or the prince, or even Cinder, after she concluded this particular stage in her life. But oh no... It ends JUST when she discovers who she is and loses the trust of the newly crowned Emperor. It's more tragic than triumphant. So unlike so many who are enthraled with innovative and revised stories, I will NOT be reading book 2 in yet another young adult series. Many may not agree with me, but I truly miss the stand-alone novel of old. A novel should be so good that it doesn't need other books to help it along. When you accomplish that, you will receive 4 or 5 stars from me. Happy reading everyone.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game, much like the old Missile Command with updated graphics. Lots of fun to play, several levels to beat. Worth the price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is awesome and an addictive game that is fun and chlangeing game that puts you to the test and if your not sastafied then don't play it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great fun for all. Using it on the kindle fire and so far no glitches or anything like that. Kids will enjoy it as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this book on Kindle to see what the hype was about and I wasn't disappointed. I've read the reviews of people saying that it's just a pointless book, that the characters are heartless etc. and it is maddening. Not every book has to be literature gold. A book can just be entertaining for the few hours it take you to read it. There is a need to point out the flaws instead of just enjoying something. This book is not for children, but the young adult age group is appropriate, as by the time we are around 15 or 16 we are most likely well aware of how the world works and the problems that we could face if our country fell apart. We let 16-18 year olds watch violence, so why not let them read it and actually use their brains?  The fact that Katniss has to kill others to survive in the arena and doesn't seem to be overly bothered by it and stop what she is doing to ponder what she did does not make her a bad character. She was trying to survive and save a friend, and who's to say that any of us wouldn't do the same. If it comes to me dying, or killing the person trying to kill me, I'm sorry to be selfish; I pick me. Her most redeeming quality is that she sacrificed herself to save her younger sister, and she doesn't seem to get that much credit for that from the critics. Katniss doesn't want to kill others, or be the one to support her family at a young age, but she does what she has to do for her family.  Collins created a world that for all we know could be real in the future. Kids are slowly losing their innocence at younger ages and in her world, the kids hardly have any because they are forced to watch children kill each other for a sick form of entertainment for the Capitol. Collins is merely exaggerating on how children have to grow up too fast, and that our obsession with watching people fall apart on reality tv may lead to more extremes.   In the end, this is a good book if you're willing to open your mind and see that not everything is perfect and that everything we have can fall apart at any moment.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|Excellent movie. I haven't read the main book Oil by Upton Sinclair, but I think the producer took some artistic freedom to paint his own picture. When you watch the movie, you actually go through a journey--a journey through the landscape of time, terrain and human heart. You see valleys, open sky, dark oil and dark sorrow. Just another slice of humanity. I don't think the movie was meant to be a portrayal of Oil business or exploration--it's about the core humanity that lurks around all those activities. Very good show, I highly recommend it. Mr Lewis is a Five Star actor, as always. However, I gave the movie 4 stars, since the transition to future was just too fast for me.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|excellent graphics great storyline. just playing the demo now but I'm going to buy this. totally worth it I love this kind of games
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The app needs to be updated to support Android 4.0. The app becomes unresponsive at random intervals. It causes the phone to freeze and a battery pull has to be performed.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app! It is easy to use, lots of devotional reading plans, and available in many translations.
1466401885|5.0|Why in the Hell did I love this book so much?   The only explanation I can come up with: Morbid curiosity. A morbid curiosity is something that is pathologically unhealthy and yet still arouses intense, often addictive interest. Aristotle says, \\"we often enjoy contemplating the most precise images of things whose sight is painful to us.\\" Well this novel often hurt to read, not because it was poorly written, but because of the disaster that was Travis and Abby. The relationship between the two is at times pathologically unhealthy, and yet I was addicted and absorbed beyond logical reason. Despite all of that, I could not put the book down. I read it in less than a day, hanging on to every word and wanting with equal parts to finish the story, and also hoping that it would never end. Jamie McGuire chose the absolute perfect title for this novel; it really was a Beautiful Disaster.   Travis is a real bad boy and a definite player, and he makes no bones about it. He's exasperating and truly unapologetic about his penchant for using women for sex. One of my favorite scenes in the book happens one morning after Travis sleeps with a woman and then refuses to take her number. Abby, thoroughly disgusted, tries in vain to impart some morality onto Travis:   I stared at the couch with revulsion. \\"She's someone's daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?\\"   \\"My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let's put it that way.\\"   I crossed my arms, angry that he made sense. \\"So, besides admitting that you're a jackass, you're saying that because she slept with you, she deserved to be tossed out like a stray cat?\\"   I love these dialogues between Travis and Abby, I found myself laughing at so many similar arguments throughout the book. The strange thing is, even though Travis is the way he is, you can't help but love him. I could forgive him because he never lied about his intentions. He never made false promises orsaid one thing and then did another. He was open and honest, not only about his debauchery but also his feelings. And of course, I can love him because he never treats Abby with the blatant disrespect that he's treated every other woman.   Abby on the surface seems well put together, a good girl, completely opposite of Travis. Although, the more we get to know Abby the more we learn that she's just as screwed up as Travis--she's just better at hiding it. Abby, unlike Travis, does lie. Don't get me wrong she is not a dishonest person, the only person she really lies to is herself. She tries to pretend that she doesn't want Travis. In her attempts to convince herself of that fact she goes so far as dating another man, a man she thinks she should love. She insists that she and Travis can only be friends, but with Travis' help she finally admits to her feelings.   Looking back I feel like I shouldn't like this novel, but I loved it. I shouldn't like Travis as a hero, but ultimately he is one of my favorites. Abby's character would normally irritate me with her indecision, except I really liked her. Their relationship is all kinds of wrong, and I still rooted for them to make it work. Overall, I was equally confounded and enthralled by the story, and I can't stop thinking about it. Excellent job Ms McGuire!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|For .99 &ccedil;ents this game is excellent. For free it's awesome. Fun missile defense game. The limited but useful upgrades you pick up along the way add a little strategy without the game bogging down. Light but challenging and entertaining fun. Two thumbs up.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|puzzle type game, tricky, makes you think. Very different from other games. Try it, you'll get hooked. Awesome game, luv it.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|The show is great. My issue is with the packaging, it's crap. It's already fallen apart on me and I've only had this a month and I certainly haven't done anything to abuse it yet. Plus (and I'm not sure what it's actually called) the part that the DVD clips onto in the case is one of the worst I have ever dealt with.  Haven't had any real problems with the dvd's themselves so. great series and I am firmly in the Matt Smith as The Doctor camp.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|not that bad for a free game but it bored me to death! none of the games were worth coming back to, and the points required to unlock games started to become insane. the ads aren't as bad as the reviews will lead you to believe.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|OK, I love Evernote, but sadly can't download it even though it is free because the app store is not available overseas. Seems silly for a free app, doesn't it. On other devices such as iphone, and on the google app store, it's no problem, but Amazon has put to many restrictions on Kindle Fire, so I'm stuck not being able to download any free apps. Ridiculous. I should have bought a different product.

B006SV2LWA|2.0|An international traveler coughs a couple of times during a layover at Chicago airport. Four days later she is dead. Her young son dies shortly afterwards. Within a few days the mystery virus has struck down tens of thousands more and the world is looking at a rerun of the 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, only much worse. There is no known cure. Social order starts to break down and looters rip through stores, looking for food, water and a homeopathic medicine they think might save them. This is where we are half an hour into Contagion and the director hasn't missed a beat. We're gripped. What could go wrong next? What calamities await? Unfortunately, the film starts spinning out of control at this point, and by the end has turned into a shapeless mess which we don't care about. One reason is a sure-footed script that stumbles badly, another is a cast of characters we don't care about (they keep dying off), while another is the irritating fact that the director is trying to cram too much in. He wants to show us what happens, as well as what might happen, plus the personal conflict the (two-dimensional) characters are experiencing, plus what the long-term implications are, and let's not forget the protesters who are furious at what they see as official inaction and incompetence, and we have to find space for the so-called independent journalist-cum-blogger who casts doubt on the authorities' attempts to find a cure while peddling the homeopathic cure and hang on, is he independent, or is he shilling for a firm and making big bucks out of it? Let's also not forget the lone father trying to keep his teen daughter away from her possibly infected boyfriend. The film gradually collapses under the weight of the loose threads and some pretty bad acting, which is a shame, since this concept had promise. Next time they should focus on a smaller roster of more fleshed-out characters.
B002ZG9800|3.0|It seems, this movie is based on real personages who themselves care much less of their affairs than producers did.<br /><br />Father of a young daughter left family and job for police behind to be himself that is a top at some stages demonstrating nicely as one could suggest, artist's copulating skills.<br /><br />The rest is satire on the US both judiciary and penetrating system a prototype serves a life for his tricks with while movie-makers are looking forward to new cinematographic awards, perhaps.

1442346272|2.0|Plenty has been written about the book itself, so no need to go over that again... other than the fact that it is totally biased in Jobs' and Apple's favor.   I just wanted to review Dylan Baker's performance as the reader. He was a horrible choice. They really needed a performer, not a dull narrator. Every character sounds exactly the same. What kind of actor can't at least attempt a British accent for British characters? This was the best selling book of 2011 and they hire a little known character actor who put in minimal effort. He just the reads the book aloud with zero imagination put into it. I was very disappointed. I would rather listen to this book read by any other audio book professional.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|For all looking for a economical camera bag, this is the right one. Now i have D5000 with 50-200 mm lens, 50 mm prime lens, 18-55mm lens, Canon HF200, SB800 flash along with all accessories and an iPad. Really satisfied with the purchase.
0767817664|4.0|This review is strictly on the movie itself, not the DVD.  Fright Night, a 1985 horror film that combined the elements of horror and comedy, is another winner from the 1980's and is one of the best films that the decade had to offer.  This film offered a unique perspective from the point of view of a young man who lives in a very peaceful neighborhood, who one day, discovers that his new neighbor living next door is an actual vampire.  The film starts with a young man named Charlie Brewster(William Ragsdale)watching his favorite TV show, called Fright Night, with his girlfriend Amy Peterson(Amanda Bearse)when he hears and sees that there is a new person living next door that is strangely moving in during the middle of the night. Soon, after seeing a familiar face on the TV news, that of a known prostitute that he saw the previous evening and also, after accidently witnessing his neighbor Jerry Dandridge(Chris Sarandon)with fangs and about to bite a young lady on the neck, he realizes that he has a vampire living next door to him and tells people that he knows about it and the reaction that he gets is one of disbelief. After surviving an attack by his neighbor, where Charlie stabs his hand with a sharp pencil and in revenge, the vampire totals Charlie's classic Mustang. He first goes to his some time friend \\"Evil Ed\\" Thompson(Stephen Geoffreys)and asks him for advice on how to defeat and destroy the vampire living next door to him. Also, in desperation, he turns to his hero, the host of Fright Night, Peter Vincent(Roddy MacDowall, may he rest in peace), who was a big star in early films as \\"The Famous Vampire Killer\\" and hopes that Mr. Vincent will believe him and hopefully, help him do something about him. After a few failed attempts, Mr. Vincent accidently discovers that Charlie's neighbor is indeed a vampire as Dandridge cast no reflection in his pocket mirror. After that, Dandridge decides to go out and follows Charlie, Evil Ed and Amy throughout the town. Evil Ed abandons them and winds up becoming Dandridge's victim by biting him. Charlie and Amy try to hide out in a dance club, but Amy winds up under the spell of the vampire and doesn't notice that Dandridge casts no reflection and after a scuffle in the club that has Dandridge kidnap Amy and orders that Charlie and Peter Vincent come to his house if they ever want to see Amy stay a mortal, but it is actually a trick as Amy has already been bitten and it is up to Charlie and Peter to stop Dandridge before he does it to somebody else or the rest of the human race. Again, I won't give too much away as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might not have seen this movie as of yet.  Writer/Director Tom Holland effectively blends horror and comedy together to create a very unique viewing experience. The film will scare the daylights of you and will have you on the edge of your seat, but will also make you laugh a little because this film does teter on the edge of spoof. It doesn't skimp on the scares nor does it skimp on the laughs as you will both be scared and be laughing a little as this film entertains very well. The film is well acted, well written and wonderfully directed by Tom Holland as he keeps the pace going and the action never lets up until the bitter end. Tom Holland works wonders with his script and his direction. It all works. It is a fun filled scary and funny movie that never gets dull no matter how many times you watch it.  PROS: The DVD has the movie looking great with the audio sounding terrific. The soundtrack also sounds wonderful. The film is available in both FullScreen (Side 1)and WideScreen (Side 2)  CONS: No special features like a commentary by the crew, cast or both. No behind the scenes featurettes and no interviews by the cast and crew reflecting on their time working on and making the movie and the fun that they had working on it. The only feature is the theatrical trailer for the movie. I suppose that the theatrical trailer is better than nothing, but still, it would have been better if the DVD had a lot more to offer.  Despite the shortcomings, it is wonderful to have this classic 1980's film on DVD.  I watched this back in 1986 on HBO while spending the night at my sister's house and I enjoyed it immensely. Years later, I would buy a VCR and I would buy this film on VHS, alongside it's sequel Fright Night Part 2, and I still enjoyed it as much as I did when I first saw it on HBO. I now have the DVD and that is great as well. I still enjoy this film immensely as this film is a very entertaining movie from both their respective genres and from the decade that it was released.  Overall, Fright Night is one of the best films that the 1980's had to offer and also, one of the best horror films ever made. If you are a fan of horror, comedy or both, this movie is for you and if you saw this movie back in the day and enjoyed it then, get the DVD so you can rediscover it and enjoy it once again. No fan of horror, comedy or both should be without this classic film of the 1980's, which helped define what the 1980's were all about.

1439148813|1.0|I will not be reading this book. The moon landings were all Faked, end of story. I am not into reading a book touted as Truth, that I know is Faked.<br />Gene Kranz said that the sides of the LM were only the thickness of two sheets of Aluminum Foil,<br /> .OO6\\" or 6 thousands of an inch thick. Do you really think a contraption like that can go to the moon and back?

0525478817|5.0|I think John Green might just be at the precipice of being one of the greatest authors of the 21st century.   To say that this is a young adult book would be a shameful misnomer. Not to say that it isn't about young adults and can't be enjoyed by that demographic, because that is the complete opposite of the truth. I say this to counter the perhaps inevitable defamation of the young adult label in the wake of the \\"Twilight\\" series of rabble, and to highlight the fact that this book - like much of John's work - is universal in appeal and theme.   This book is incredible. I recommend it to all people able to read and appreciate it. Hands down, one of the best books I've read. It certainly hits you hard, a book that makes you wish that it wasn't over when it was.   I suppose that's the mark of great art - it leaves you wishing that it could just last forever. But, alas, we live in a finite, mortal world. But if ever a work of literature could be called great art, this work is most certainly worthy of that title.    I find solace in the fact that the Novelist Emeritus John Green is only early in his career, one that is destined for greatness.

1451627289|5.0|No, I'm not really a Stephen King fan.....don't read his books.  But the contents of this book intrigued me.  First, he goes back to my era....the 50's.  Second, I love anything about JFK.  Third, I love anything pertaining to time travel.  Fourth, the concept of changing history and the affects of it just fascinated me.  This is a really big book, literally, over 800 pages.  I bought the book because I had a gift certificate and if I was going to pay that much for a book I wanted the actual book not the Kindle version.  That all being said....since I'm so used to the Kindle, it was very hard for me to handle and hold this huge book.  I've been spoiled....just pushing a button...versus turning pages and holding......but, because this book was so interesting to me, I got through it and loved it.  Could not imagine how he was going to end this story, but in my humbler opinion, Mr. King did it well.  I'm a skimmer.  When I read a book and it goes. Into unnecessary and boring detail, I'll skim through.  I didn't do that with this book.  I'm still not a Stephen King fan.....this book will not make me want to read all of his other books....but I'm a little more open to the possibility now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it!  The tap feature is great...really enjoy playing!  I can sit and play for hours...time flies when you're caught up in this game.
B00007LTIL|4.0|I'm not a great old dead fan, but a recent one.  What I realize is that 1)they are best live; 2) i like Jerry's solo's.  This is a studio album and Jerry doesn't solo.  But there is a chunk of live bonus material of the songs they did in the studio...and here Jerry's brilliant soloing can be found.  This makes it worthwhile for me.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|If you're a fan of the short-lived series, this is a must have. I remember when I first saw it, I got those corny goosebumps after seeing the old crew back together. The bluray provides beautiful stunning picture quality that the series truly deserves. As for the story itself, I won't reveal too much but they answer a few questions the series was never quite able to do so. It's a very action packed film that shares everything which made the series what it once was.<br /><br />As I said, if you're a fan of the series, you have to complete the viewing experience with this film. It's well worth the price and the picture quality is amazing.

B004SIP7F8|5.0|i never received the item, nor received confirmation of shipment from provider. waiting for its delivery so i can view and provide an honest review.  anticpiating delivery.[[ASIN:B0001WTWCO The English Patient (Miramax Collector's Edition)]]
140053271X|1.0|First of all, I tried posting this review on bn.com, but they won't post because of inappropriate language!?!  (Or is it because I gave a bad review?)  I have never in my life written a review for a product- good or bad (even though I do a large amount of shopping online), but my experience with my Nook Touch has upset me greatly, and I would like to warn others shopping for an e-reader to consider my experience beforehand so that they make a well informed decision. My complains are:  - I experienced two major technical problems within 5 months of purchase.  - Technical support was clueless as to how to fix them, and instead suggested resetting and/or replacing the entire unit.  - The replacement experience has taken over two months and 3 lengthy phone calls to customer service, and yet I still don't have a replacement.  When I was shopping for an e-reader this past summer, I originally was going to go with a Kindle since they have a better selection of cheap and/or free e-books, but at that time, only the Nook had Touch capabilities, which ultimately won me over.  Everything was going great until the button for Settings no longer responded, which meant I could no longer turn on the wireless to download any other books. Technical Service had no idea how to fix it, so they walked me through resetting the entire device, deleting everything I already had on it. Then they suggested updating my software version to avoid problems in the future. Unfortunately, this completely crashed the Nook to the point that even the most drastic steps to do a full reset didn't work. They said that since it was under warranty they would ship me a replacement.  It never came. I called back every 2-3 weeks for the past two months asking for an update. I got excuses like: they warehouse is busy, and you have to send yours back first (even though the standard protocol involves getting the new one before sending yours back).  At this point, I don't even want it anymore. And even though the user manual says that you can get your money back if your device is found to be defective, I have been informed that this only happens if you return it during the first 14 days of ownership. Going as high up on the customer service ladder as possible, all they said is that I cannot get a refund, and a replacement should be coming 'soon.'  When and if it comes, I probably won't open it. I don't want to be reminded of this experience every time I pick it up. I'm going to cut my losses, and go get myself a Kindle. I have dealt with Amazon customer service in the past and have extremely satisfied with them. Lesson learned.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I really enjoy the different translations and having the option of a study plan.  Very easy to use and navigate. This is one of my favorite apps.
B0042X9L6A|1.0|many folks have complained about the battery door breaking prematurely. Mine has too so I thought I could get it repaired under warranty since it was less than a year old. I was wrong.

B000EUDAWG|4.0|My nephew who is 9 loves the spider. He doesn't use the control that much being that you can hear the spider approaching because it is a little noisy. He uses the spider to scare family members. It's a little fury and it moves somewhat like a real spider. I'm sure a little spider fan will like it.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|First, this book is rather sacrilegious. If that offends you, you will not like this book. Turn around and read something out of the religious fiction section. If you're open to sacrilege being a bit funny and having a laugh at the End of Days, this book is your ticket. Having a familiarity with Christianity helps a great deal with appreciating this story.  I've read Good Omens at least 5 times over the last 10 years, and every time it gets better. I recommend it to friends, and they've all loved it too. It is a great combination of Gaimain's dark, wry style and the slapstick, tongue-in-cheek approach of Pratchett. I love both of these authors on their own, but in this book I find they strike a cosmic balance and the result is even more awesome. You can definitely tell who wrote which bits, but it's a seamless single story.  I look forward to rereading this book many more times!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|soo fun, I love playing this game, I play all the time, I love getting new records, and getting over 200,000 points, I &lt;3 this game
0307279189|5.0|I love this book! It has completely changed the way I run and the way I go about my training. It was a gift from a professor, who knew I was training for a half marathon over the summer, and she could not have had better timing. The historical background and story were interesting, and the information about form, running shoes, and training was invaluable. I now follow the author religiously and recommend this book to everyone (from runners to inactive people who have persistent foot problems alike). If you want a great story combined with insight on how you can maintain a lifelong running career, this is the book for you.
0525478817|5.0|I've been a fan of John's work ever since I picked up my first copy of Looking for Alaska, so needless to say I was ecstatic to get my copy of The Fault in Our Stars.   I started reading as soon as I took it out of the package and couldn't put it down until I had finished.   I was laughing, crying, and 'awww!'ing my way through the entire novel.   It's beautifully spun with heartache, tragedy, and hope. John even did an amazing job as narrating through a 16 year old girls perspective.   Definitely some of his best work yet.

B005K17RU0|4.0|Has good up to date info. The only thing keeping it from 5 star is it runs all the time in the background. Only alternative is to force it to close and use only when needed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. I love it so much. there are so many games!!! it has games that are hard and some that are easy.
0446571415|3.0|This book started off slow repeating itself about the bomb in the park as all investigations lead from everything that happened in the park.Eventually the story started to move quickly but the story should have ended when the bomber was caught but it continued and got drawn out as the start for the chase for the bomber began.This dragged on so i skimmed to the end.Got bored

B005EHNEDO|5.0|I love this CD. It is an excellent listen for all level of Wilco fans. Most songs have a tinge of Summerteeth in their foundation, but have evolved with the integration of all Wilco members. I enjoy listening to the entire works multiple times because there is so many different layers of music to focus attention. Jeff Tweedy's lyrics are only the first layer of the song.  This CD has a song for all types of Wilco fans. \\"Art of Almost\\" contains Glenn Kotche's cliff hanging drum beat with Nels Cline's mind blowing guitar solos. \\"I Might\\" fuses John Stirratt's strong bass line with Mikeal Jorgensen's catchy piano tunes. \\"Sunloathe\\" has a feeling of Summerteeth's slower rock ballads with meaningful lyrics that break your heart while \\"Dawned on Me\\" and \\"Born Alone\\" forces a fan to reminisce about the poppy upbeat Summerteeth tracks which flow nicely thanks to Pat Sansone's incorporation of mult-instruments.   Feeling bouncy? Listen to \\"Capitol City\\". Want to dance? Listen to \\"Standing O\\". Need to chill? Listen to \\"Black Moon\\", \\"Open Mind\\", and \\"Rising Red Lung\\" (in a row). Crave a story? Dedicate 12 minutes to \\"One Sunday Morning\\", the mesh of lyrics and repetitive guitar hook will trap you in a trance until 11 minutes have passed and you start regretting the close of the song.  I'm so grateful for this CD. Everytime I think Wilco has shown its best works, they produce a new masterpiece. \\"Whole Love\\" is a song which encompasses the feeling of the entire album. This is a song that may need to grow on you, but after it starts, it can't stop.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|its so fun but its hard. its i don't know how many levels it has. u could play for hours and not stop

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I purchased the Fiio E6 because my Sennheiser HD438s weren't getting as loud as I liked using my iPod Nano.  I use this along with the Fiio L1 lod and love the sound quality, with plenty of volume to spare now.  I had issues with the lod, but that is a separate story.<br /><br />The E6 was smaller than I imagined (the same size as my iPod Nano).  This is a good thing, it just took me by surprise.  I will not be using it while out and about, but it seems like it would be quite portable.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone looking for a little more sound for their headphones at a great price.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Really enjoyed this app. Was able to kill a lot of down time with it. Also enjoy that you have to work to get new games, and therefore experience games you normally wouldn't play.
031261246X|1.0|As others have said this book is full of trite cliches and a mediocre and predictable plot. While the action moves right along there is not much to hook the reader - you've heard this story before in a half dozen Bond movies for 30 years.  The book reads like it was written in 2003 and I suspect it was but the author couldn't find a publisher to pick it up until 2011. That alone should be a warning sign. But the worst part is there is a gaping plot hole ( hint, change the time on your computer... No virus trigger ). As someone with a technical background, Mark shold know better. I'll also echo the distaste in the pointless and completely phony sex scenes. Lame.  If you want to read a truly engaging book in this genre with genuinely original ideas, a rollercoaster of action, and a plot that keeps you guessing to the last page, pick up Daemon by Daniel Suarez instead and skip this snoozer.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is perfect for a touch screen. The interface is very intuitive and it's super fun. I think this game makes me smarter.
B0063IH60K|2.0|this game is GREAT and works exceptionally well on kindle fire. but has adds spool bad that it literally closes the app n redirects you to webpages at random. very annoyong, really kills this
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Thanks for a really fun game! It's lots of action and has a few twists you don't suspect. 5 stars!
160094048X|5.0|I bought this book after tasting a cookie a vegan friend gave me. I am not vegan but my husband has high cholesterol and cookies with Butter  are not as good for him as those made with canola oil which is low on saturated fat. He could not tell they were vegan until he saw the book lying around.  Great book for those of us looking for a tasty healthier cookie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The main thing I missed in the Weather Channel app that comes on the Fire is that it doesn't have radar. The description says it's coming soon, but in the meantime, the Accuweather app has it now!  I like the temperature that pops up in the notification bar. One unexpected benefit of it is that when my Fire wakes up and I'm waiting for the wireless network to become active, the Accuweather app's temperature display is usually the first thing to pop up.  The interface for browsing the current weather data and the long-range forecast is super-smooth and it looks great with the black background.   The only thing I have found that I miss in this app is some of the news stories about the weather than you can read on AccuWeather's website (I'm already an accuweather fan because of the news and blogs posted by the true weather geeks there). I guess more mobile users prefer the videos (which the app has) though.  I didn't have any trouble whatsoever with it on my Fire.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I think that this is a good game most likely for younger children . I think it should be a little easier.

0316056863|4.0|Hey! how about that for your next book, Tina Fey! You could go with an entire \\"__pants\\" themed series!!   My intention for writing a review was to try  to \\"process\\" my intense feelings after reading Bossypants ... certainly not to pester anyone for a writing job [insert smiley face]. But I must say that I am a fan of hers; went into the whole thing a fan, of the human Tina, the writer Tina, the improv 2nd City Tina, the shows -- SNL and 30 Rock,women with scars, etc. She is, no question, one funny gal, but even more, she is one gifted writer. Excellent language skills on her and some real-life advice that I shall carry with me into the days (improv as a method for interacting with the world is great stuff).  I especially appreciate her humor as it is rather stealth-ish. She eschews the formulaic (sometimes) and throws one in there when you're thinking she's offering something everyday useful and/or sincere. Sure it's funny, but even more importantly, it's break-your-face-into-big-fat-grin-good. Her book took me out of my day of \\"how in god's name will I pay rent\\" and makes me smile from deep within.   Not unlike the many who've read this book, (I borrowed it from the Library) I inhaled it in one sitting (as I watched NFL) and am feeling sated and like I've spent the day with a warm and wonderful friend. I don't know about \\"bossypants,\\" but she is indeed one big honking smartypants and I'm an even bigger honking fan having read her book.  Mary, Berwyn  ps: Would that she could teach such comedy writing ... perhaps adjunct professor at darby community college? if indeed there is such a place.  pps: as for the cover of the book, not sure I'd want some sweaty manhands stuck on my face -- kinda skeevy. Must be her husband \\"Rod\\".
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I searched and searched for the right Bible for my kindle fire.  This is the best I found.  I love that I can choose whatever translation I want.  I use this app at home for devotion/prayer time as well as in church. Very easy to find the book, chapter, and verse.  I reccommend this to any Bible reader.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun at first but the amount of points needed to get more games unlocked is ridiculous. already bored with it because you're forced to play games over and over.

B004U52VPS|1.0|After finding this game on Amazon for 32+ dollars, I went to walmart the next day and it was 14.00!!!! You have to be kidding me! Why so expensive on the great Amazon? Lesson learned...look elsewhere unless you are a millionaire that has money to blow. Most likely we are not.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Great gift for anyone who enjoys games. A fun way to spend time together without electronics.  Gave it as a gift and my family LOVED it! We play all the time.

B001HN6922|4.0|My son bought it for a Christmas present for his dad.  My husband has watched it three times since Christmas.  Per my husband, \\"Love the animation!  Pixar delivers, as they did in the first one.  Also, love the bonus features.\\"

1591843790|4.0|This book is good. Really good. It has lots of actionable tips that will help you capture attention.<br /><br />I was hoping for a bit more based on the hype. It felt like disjointed bits of information organized by category. The tips were good, but I had trouble putting them together and figuring out what to do next after I'd finished reading. I'd have liked 'action steps' at the end of the book, similar to what Mari Smith did in The New Relationship Marketing.<br /><br />It's a solid book if you are primarily looking for inspiration, rather then creating a plan to enchant people. I learned so, so much.
B004289ZW0|1.0|I purchased this for my wi-fi only iPad and it seemed like a good buy.  The problems first raised their heads with the poor on/off slider switch (or lack there of).  The unit is constantly out of power because it turns on with the slightest of touches and can almost never be turned off.  Useless if it cannot be turned on when needed because its battery is dead.  I contacted customer support and they could care less if the unit works.  No help at all.  Beware of this item.
1591841666|4.0|I'm currently going through the dip. I read the book about a year ago and thought it was an interesting read.<br /><br />The dip is nothing but an intellectual exercise until you actually go through it. I recommend having it in the emergency section of your business books. I often go back to it to read bits of it to reassure myself that my current state is temporary.<br /><br />I also believe that this the type of book where Godin thrives. He's helping us address a problem rather then trying to create social change. It is also digestible enough to be read in a train ride, and not interrupt a workday.
B0053R3J7G|3.0|I miss lego's from when I was a kid where you could build a bunch of different items from the lego package. Lego's today are just so predertimed that all of the creativity has been sucked out. My kid liked putting it together. But then he's done and has no more use for it. Seems like a bit of a waste. The product itself is fine, its just that its replay value is nil and all it teaches is to follow directions perfectly.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|When I look for good art, be it music, movies, paint, etc.., I pay close attention to how polarizing it is as a subject. This film is one of those love it or hate it movies. You will know in the first five minutes if you like it or not. But that's a good thing. For me, it was an ultra cool trip back to the 80's. It is set in modern day, you just get the vibe of the 80s. There is extreme violence, usually at the hands of the Driver, and it even made my desensitized brain flinch. But it serves to break you out of the spell so you don't get caught up with the Driver, who is sort of an anti-hero, a monster himself. You feel guilty about cheering him on as he makes a bloodbath, but you want these sick people to pay. It is brutal but it is beautiful. Don't let all the talk of violence scare you off, there is a lot of thinking time. I was riveted even on scenes where Driver was rebuilding a carburetor. It was beautifully shot, little grunge, a little glam. The music is also excellent and fits the film perfectly, perhaps even sets the feel for the majority of the movie.   Give this movie a chance, you might love it(or hate it.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun. I love the games and how you can buy more. some are kind of tricky but its a good way to pass time.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|When looking at recipe steps it says \\"rotate for steps with photos\\".  When I rotate, it doesn't switch to landscape, doesn't provide photos.  I downloaded the 80MB of additional data and the kindle said the app was ready to use.  No luck.  It's really frustating because it's so close to being a great app.  Looks great, lots of instructions for kitchen-phobic folks like me.  Just wish all the features worked as advertised.
030726999X|5.0|This is a fabulous end to a great trilogy.  Highly recommended to all readers who enjoy mystery, suspense, and thrills.  You obviously have to read the first 2 of the trilogy first or you'll have absolutely no idea what's going on.
1609611543|2.0|I just finished reading \\"Wheat Belly\\" & besides all the wheat products recommended you eliminate from your diet, are many other food items I thought I could replace the wheat products with. These are also recommended you eliminate. So, to me, it looks really, really similar to the old Atkins diet I tried 12 years ago.  I feel it was a waste of my money to buy this book.

B003UESJEM|4.0|Critics raved about Wall Street drama [[ASIN:B005FITIGO Margin Call]], but I was more impressed with John Wells' \\"The Company Men.\\" Whereas \\"Margin Call\\" is told from the business owners'/crooks' side of the economic fallout, \\"The Company Men\\" shows what happens on both sides of the coin, especially to the \\"little guy\\" -- the guy who was let go because of the mistakes and greed of company bigwigs. Ben Affleck, who has often been a punching bag for critics when he first started acting -- has now really honed his craft, whether it be acting or directing ([[ASIN:B002ZG99N6 The Town]]). In this film, he portrays a mid-sized bigwig who gets fired and has to work -- any way he can -- to keep his life and family together. Of course, along the way, he learns that there's more to life than he thought. However, from that description and the look of the trailer, don't immediately think this is a sappy feel-good film. There's more to it than that as Wells' script (similar to the stuff he wrote for NBC's \\"ER\\") has good moments and bad moments, making a perfect balanced story.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Based on the bestselling novel by Kathryn Stockett, I was not really intrigued by this story. But I had heard great things about it and decided to give it a try. After all, it has Emma Stone in it, so how bad could it be? I was actually touched by the story and performances in this film. The true stars are Viola Davis ([[ASIN:B004SIP71M Doubt]]) and Octavia Spencer ([[ASIN:B004AV5GX6 Dinner for Schmucks]]), who play maids Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, respectively. Both drive this film with wonderful performances, bringing their characters to life. The previews make the film look like it revolves mostly around Stone's character Skeeter, but it is both of these maids who truly make the movie. Also noteworthy are Jessica Chastain ([[ASIN:B003Y5H4Y8 The Debt]]) as outcast socialite Celia Foote, and Bryce Dallas Howard, continuing her 2011 wretched characters (see [[ASIN:B004QL7KKC 50/50]]), as antagonist Hilly Holbrook; after seeing her confrontation with ex-maid Jackson, I will never look at pie the same way again. The best thing about this film -- besides the performances -- is the story, which provides a snapshot to a way of life that most of the newer, younger generation do not truly know or acknowledge. Some may argue that this film is a bit misleading of black history, but I think it shows just one instance of that turbulent, trying time for African Americans. And that's its strength.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Decent game considering its free. However I do wish some of the gamed were a tad easier. But I'm not a big gamer either.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Looking at the movie trailer for this film, I thought it would be another mindless romantic comedy (rom-com), but nothing could be further from the truth. Steve Carell as married Cal Weaver and Ryan Gosling as ladies man bachelor Jacob Palmer make a great team. One can watch Gosling and tell that if he continues to take the roles he does, he's going to be a great actor with a great career. There are twists and turns in this film that I didn't think were going to happen. And the wonderfully written ups and downs of the story are a credit to writer Dan Fogelman ([[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Single-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B004G600A4 Tangled]]). All of the actors in this film own the screen when they're on it; especially good (besides Carell and Gosling) are Julianne Moore as Cal's mid-life crisis wife and Emma Stone as Gosling's love interest, Hannah. Whether you like romance movies or not, watch this film. You won't be disappointed!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|it was so cool I loved this app I play it all night if I can you must get it and have a blast by
B005OK721G|5.0|So I wanted to see this movie in theaters but I missed it, but I managed to get it outta the Red Box and man am I glad I did!<br /><br />This is the classic story of the offspring of a killer that tried to get out of the game.  The little girl's father is killed by his former boss or partner, (I really can't remember which, my bad).  And the little girl witnesses it and she manages to get away and swears revenge.<br /><br />Throughout the movie she kills many people who are thieves, criminals, drug dealers, etc. in order to draw out the guy who killed her parents.  She finally manages to find where he is hiding and she decides to take off the kid gloves.  No more sneaking around, being stealthy, she breaks out the big guns and goes in with guns blazing and she cuts a bloody swath of destruction through the guy's fortress and takes him out.<br /><br />I really can't think of anything wrong with this movie or anything that I would change if I had the chance to remake it myself.  So if you like action, you've gotta check this one out!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This is a great book! I'm not usually a Stephen King fan but this is well written, and keeps you on the edge of your seat page after page. If you like suspense get this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is quick fun. I like that you can replay the same hand over until you win. Take a chance!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has lots of easy games and some not so easy games too.  it is a pretty good time killer.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Picked this up on the app of the day deal - and I love it! With the Gmail tie-in it makes managing your computers a snap. Some of the keyboard/mouse commands can be tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, its no biggie. I'm using an HP Touchpad that has been converter to an android OS, so I get a nice full screen view. This is great for when I'm at work and break the remote desktop capablitess in WHS2011 and need to reconnect to fix my 'oopsy'.

0553386794|5.0|What an epic tale developed by George Martin... A Game of Thrones.  I'm currently reading Book 5, so I've had this first tale as well as the next three.<br /><br />The storyline is fabulous.  This is an epic fantasy, the tale of two royal families battling for control of the Seven Kingdoms, while others have plans as well.  It is particularly interesting because, for the most part, it doesn't depend on magic or sorcery.  It seems to me (in my historical ignorance), the story reflects the dinginess and culture of Europe's 13th-14th centuries, decidedly before any Enlightenment.  The \\"smallfolk\\" are underfed, overworked, and terribly affected by these wars.  There is little for women other than marriage and children, working at brothels, life as a septa (a religious position), or a \\"silent sister,\\" preparing the dead for burial.  Knights (Sers) are usually completely uncaring about the smallfolk, always working to increase their own stature in the eyes of the Royals.  And so on.<br /><br />My title noted parental concerns.  So I'm reading this five to six years after my kids have finished them (the paperbacks are decidedly worn,thus well-read), and my eyes popped out.  Graphic descriptions of torture, rape, and sex are common throughout.  Without being prudish, I would say for the most part that these awful behaviors are essential for the story as well.  Women are cheap.  Life is cheaper.  George Martin develops this world as a grim place, and there are no apologies for it.  Chamber pots in rooms stink.  Hanging bodies feed the crows, eyes first.  I wonder how many kids learned about the vocabulary of sex as well as new curse words from this book?  Without being judgmental, just be aware.  Parents, why don't you read these books, so you can discuss them with your kids?<br /><br />One of the intriguing things about this broader tale, that I love and I hate, is Martin's tendency to develop interesting characters that you come to care about.  Then... they die, usually badly.  Waaah!
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|I have been practicing Yoga for more than 12 years and have always had a hard time focusing...until my instructor played this CD one day! I find myself humming away and before I knew it, the class was over and I was in a better mood. I have been searching trying to find this CD and am very excited to have found it now. It is very soothing and beautiful. Prior to hearing this, my favorite CD's seemed to be guitar or ocean sounds. The music from other countries sometimes made me too hyper. I never knew how melodic Sanscrit could be.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am not normally a huge sci-fi fan, but after I read this book I could not wait to read the next one. Orson Scott Card creates a true classic in the world of science fiction. I honestly could not find one thing that I did not like about this book. I could not take my eyes off this book for two days. A must read.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is quality story that captures the imagination and mind, staying with you long after the last page.<br />I couldn't put Hunger Games down - to the point where the moment I finished the first book, I immediately ran out to grab the rest of the trilogy.<br />Collins weaves an incredible tale in a unique post-apocalyptic world  where children from outer district are sent to the ruling central Capitol to be sacrificed in Colosseum-style games in which only one can survive.<br /><br />The story's main character, Katniss, is an unusual heroine with a unique ability and drive to survive. In fact, I think one of the few things that bothers me about this book is the ease with which Katniss kills. While her lack of sentimentality is what enables her to survive, it's a bit disturbing for readers to be presented with a world in which people revel in children murdering one another, while also having the central character ponder the death of her peers with only minimal remorse.<br /><br />But of course that's part of what makes Hunger Games such a fascinating story - there's a huge element of taboo and horror that's difficult to ignore. Collins writes a mesmerizing story while also delivering an interesting critique on present reality-TV-culture, warning readers that the cost of such entertainment could be one's own humanity.<br /><br />The world created by Collins gives enough detail so that one can become immersed, while leaving enough space for the imaginative reader to make the world their own.<br /><br />I originally was thinking of giving this book to my 11 year old sister, but quickly changed my mind once I started reading it. I'd wait till at least 14 on this one with such heavy and disturbing themes.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|pretty fun game to kill time. first levels are not very challenging, but gets hard fast. requires some strategy when selecting upgrades to your defenses.

B004MC8CA2|3.0|I use this app everyday for my daily reading.  It has an excellant selection bibles to choose from and you can also setup reminders for your plans.  I do wish it had offline capability for highlighting, bookmarks, and notes.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Lantern's got some good and some bad. Lantern resides among other tier-two superheroes like DareDevil, Ghost Rider and Thor. It's always a hurdle for filmmakers to dish all the backstory so they can get right into the action since the majority of viewers don't know GL's origin. We have to learn some history about him before he faces the Ultimate Bad Guy.  Goodwise, Reynolds has stepped up in acting ability as of late. He moderated the wise-ass routine enough here to let his character come through, but it's still Reynolds. CG is passable, and very emerald.  And there's Blake Lively - just another pretty face, but oh what a face (and everything else).   The guy who played Sinestro did a wonderful job, and Peter Sarsgaard (another top talent) did well too despite the giant head.  Badwise:  CG is sometimes low-grade, as would befit a movie like this. Superman and Spiderman get the best CG treatment.  Rushed story. There's just not enough time to define the character, explore his motives, understand the supporting characters, introduce a superhero universe of galactic cops, narrate the bad guy's motives and origins, and wrap it up in 180 minutes. Your brain can't process all the changes quick enough.
B0015AARJI|3.0|I rated this at the medium level because it is listed as a game, which it is not... But my son had asked for this controller to play his games with and he was very happy to get it for Christmas.  It arrived quickly and in good order.  Thanks!
B0000640VN|4.0|I love Kate & Leopold because it for once has a guy being a Gentleman. Modern movements seek to describe us men as over grown children, and here is where K&L leaves the pack behind.  Kate to be frank.... is not the most pleasant of people in this movie. In fact... I wonder why Leopold even likes her.  But I digress, he woes her over with the marks of true men and gentlemanly ways.  It is a chick flick through and through, though. So don't be expecting anything more.<br /><br />In short: it's a sweet romantic comedy that displays the lost art of being a gentlemen.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My little brother wanted this movie so i ordered it last minute for Christmas and it arrived in two days which is amazing. Our entire family likes the movies so it was a cool gift.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very satisfying game. you can try to beat your time record. the game is great for passing time. I love playing the game when I don't have stuff to do.
0385534639|5.0|I really liked this book. Well-written, beautifully imagined, and I love the ending. I love that an aura of mystery remained, even after the final page; that there is a sense of the bitter-sweet, resolution without perfection; for we none of us emerge from our battles unscarred. I've never read a book quite like this, and I love that about it. Bravo! Beautiful debut.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun, and you have access to different types of games within the one game. It you're looking for a more complex and customized game, then I would not suggest this app, but if you are looking for a simple time waster, then this is the right game for you. The ads aren't very annoying, either.

6304806418|5.0|As a fan of stage musicals, I generally consider Broadway and West End (London) actors to be the best vocalists going.  I generally lament Webber's Really Useful Films' choice of lead actors for their films, wishing they would draw top vocalists over charming and attractive actors less vocally skilled.  In this case, however, Madonna was the perfect Evita.  Elaine Page might be a slightly better vocalist, but she was simply too old to star in this film, in which Madonna reminds us that it wasn't just her pranks and hairstyles that kept her at the top for so long.  She is an outstanding vocalist.  She fits this role beautifully in every way.  I found Banderas' voice a little gravely at first, but once you accept that, you realize that it's a fine style, and his acting adds edge and drama.  Some of the songs were re-worked for the better, particularly \\"Oh, What a Circus\\"; the Spanish guitar works much better than the more traditional, non-distinct, and un-Latin versions of earlier recordings.<br /><br />I found the visuals stunning.  As a kid I hated Rogers and Hammerstein scenes in which the entire town breaks out in song.  In Evita's Argentina the masses singing, dancing, and marching through the streets serves a vital role, and the massive scale made possible by moving the production off stage only adds to its power.  Perhaps I've just grown up, or maybe Really Useful Films makes the 1,000 person street choir look more believable.  Either way, it works--all of it.
B0068RGVMK|5.0|Nightwish has been my favorite band ever since I first heard them back in 2003. I bought Oceanborn and Wishmaster and have been a huge fan ever since. The group is the keyboardist, Tuomas Holopainen's baby (he writes almost all of the music and lyrics), but the original singer's operatic vocal style on the first five albums made Nightwish even more unique. After Tarja was fired from the band for her ego, Anette Olzon took over and she has done a fine job on Dark Passion Play and this new album, Imaginaerum. I still prefer Tarja, but Anette's more pop sounding vocals seem to fit most of the new songs. Marco's singing as well as playing bass still makes a huge impact and Emppu, as always, lays down some heavy guitar riffs. The orchestration is nearly flawless.<br /><br />I enjoy every song on Imaginaerum and they are all so different, but I do wish \\"Song of Myself\\" didn't go from a really good song to a 7 minute poem. It was okay the first time, but now I just skip to the next song as soon as the guy starts talking. That is the only major negative I can say.<br /><br />The really good news is that a band that has been together since 1996 are still really young. Most are in their early 30's, so I can hopefully look forward to decades more of amazing material.
B000056NX5|4.0|As a devoted Andrew Lloyd Webber fan, I've heard JCS dozens of times, seen it live, and seen and heard its numbers done by performers of all kinds.  For whatever reason, Webber seems to save his best vocal performers for stage productions and sound recordings, and for his films chooses actors who can sing adequately.  The Jesus character has a good voice, but Judas--the main character--simply cannot measure up to the dynamic performance on my 1996 Original London cast recording.  Mary departs little from either Helen Ready, Yvonne Elliman, or the 1996 cast member (or ABBA's Agnatha Faltskog, for that matter - nice recording in Swedish); her vocals are solid and thoughtful if less magical than Elliman's.    Visually, Really Useful Films has done a commendable job of making a stage production captivating on film.  Modern costumes against Roman columns adeptly captures the historical yet current message of the production; bringing Jesus' final days into the present has a powerful spiritual effect.  The production also does a nice job of illuminating both the external and internal agony of the decision, trial, and crucifixion for Jesus and the internal agony of Judas's miscalculation and his suicide without resorting to gratuitous gore.    Hopefully this inspires increased interest in stage performances, which I have to believe is Webber's real objective in making his films.  If you like the films, give yourself a real treat and see a stage production.  Then, like me, buy the films because you can't get enough.
0670858048|4.0|Great way to spend 15-20 minutes with your kid. They pick up the obvious stuff and you can point out the minutiae. Fun for everyone, and very clever.
B0008JIJ2E|3.0|The movie is OK, but Ralph Maccio is just way too soft to be believable in the final fight scenes. And, as usual, a good bit of the movie is taken up with adolescent puppy-loving that does not advance the central theme in any way. Mildly diverting.
B004WN1A7S|5.0|I got this mouse pad to replace a cheap wal-mart pad. Before this pad arrived I was gifted a qck steel series cloth pad, but after getting the alumnic it was quickly shelved. I haven't found anything I don't like about this mouse surface. The only difficulty with using the alumnic is the free movement compared to cloth surfaces. It makes for a very light feel allowing unhindered movement. I like to do computer gaming which is mainly been skyrim and starcraft 2. I feel like the transition to this mousepad has helped a lot, specifically with SC2. I like to be able to mouse scroll over areas which I can do quickly with this pad. At the same time though I can have the precision to target fire. I will update after some more time on durability but the alumnic has a very high quality feel and finish. I would highly recommend the alumnic and in my opinion the price is fair for the quality of the product. I use a razer spectre optical mouse so use with other types of mice may vary. Looking into getting a laser mouse and will update with the compatibility.
B00005JXY3|3.0|Ralph Maccio is simply too young and too soft looking to be credible in the role of an ultimately super tough karate fighter. And the puppy love continues from the original film, only they had to ditch the first girl friend and provide a beautiful young (but older looking than Ralphie) Japanese girl who immediately takes to our hero for no discernible reason. In the end, the antagonist is just too tough looking and tough behaving to make the ending plausible. Like the original, mildly diverting if you have nothing better to do.
B0058VW36U|5.0|most addicting best game I have ever played. its so much fun! everyone no matter their age love it. coolii
B00005JKNF|4.0|This movie was funny in places. Historical in places. Very British in all over. It kept moving so you didn't get bored but also entertained you. It is worth seeing. I was shocked to see Ryan Phillipe in it. Clive Owen always seems to over power his characters with his deep voice and very confident demeanor but he was so thin back then.  The drawbacks for me were   1) I cannot understand what some of those people were saying with their thick accents (even after seeing it 2 times), especially the daughter that was sleeping with that one woman's blond husband.   2) I think it is weaselly of Hollywood (even if it may be due to free trade pacts) to \\"throw an American\\" in a British setting just because it is an American film. Americans don't have to be everywhere.  3) It had too many minor characters getting in the way to where I was asking \\"Who is that?\\". I don't mean the extras . . . obviously there was a need for them . . . it was a mansion with lots of \\"help\\" running around. I mean the blond guy and black headed guy who came late. Who were they? And the one maid who swore her allegiance to the drunken head butler. Who was she? What was all of that about? And for that matter what was the drunken head butler's problem? And which was the head butler? The drunk at the end or the older blond headed guy sobbing over the dead body? It was a little confusing. But not enough to be a distraction. Maybe some of those other characters mentioned who they were and I just couldn't understand them.   4) It seems that all movies like this (British, set in a previous error, of high society, very Hollywood centric, etc) (e.g. A Room with a View, Another Country, Atonement, Damaged, etc) seem to insist on showing British folks fornicating in stairways, libraries, cellars, basements, bushes, weeds, fields, etc. Perhaps the point is that they are not as sophisticated and refined as they pretend.  But does it have to be a part of every one of these movies? Showing the kitchen maid and thatblack headed dude doing it in the kitchen and then in some random servant's room etc didn't add anything here.  5) And the staid examples of the snobby rich being mean to the lowly poor. We get it. The British have a class system. We know already.   Even so it was a good movie.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I gave this product a try for keeping some of my notes and found to my happy surprise that it is a wonderful complex app that does so much more than I can mention here. I am still learning all the useful things it enables me to do. I love it! I have made a really great recipe file that I plan on using a lot. I have also created many notebooks that will help me to organize my life. I love the photo and web clipping features. It is a very worthwhile app to use and it is well worth your consideration. The upgrade works out to be a little less than $4 a month and is worth it.

B006SV2LWA|4.0|Very accurate. Better than most disaster movies because it did show how quickly the world can change but it did not immediately have everyone turn into non-thinking,non-feeling animals. It takes more than 4 months to destroy humanity. The characters were real and there were no superheroes or villains,just people. However, the movie did a decent job of portraying the desperation that would naturally accompany this kind of epidemic.  The characters were very real and the situations were very authentic.  It is easy to understand how people would behave given the threat of a disease like this. From leaking information to loved ones but withholding that information from the general public to testing a vaccine on yourself without approval.  Part of the social commentary in the movie was the situation involving treatment and care of the people who were chasing the origin of the disease and who risked their own lives.  In a serious situation like this, they became the true heroes just for doing their jobs.

1596680296|5.0|I've not been knitting long and actually am just doing my second pair of socks. This book has been an indispensable source for me as I progress through my project. The tips are great and the graphics are really clear and easy to understand.  The Kitchener stitch portion was especially helpful as I'd only closed toes in socks during a class and was nervous doing it the first time on my own. I would highly recommend this book to anyone knitting socks, whether you're a beginner like me or a pro. The information is just so convenient, appropriate for the task, and easy to follow. It's a smart addition to any knitting library. I enjoyed the way this book was written so much that I also ordered another Ann Budd Sock book, [[ASIN:1596680326 Favorite Socks]] and [[ASIN:1596683120 Sock Knitting Master Class: Innovative Techniques + Patterns from Top Designers]]. I've been looking through these books and can't wait to start my next sock project.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|There are reviews on this app ranging from 5 to 1 stars, however, for the Kindle Fire at least, disregard all ratings below 5. Very professional, excellent for simply writing and not being distracted by other features. Reminds me of Word 2010 set on XP appearance. If you have 10 dollars to spend, buy this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I use it daily. and so many great features for a free app. I love that its so quick and easy and offers so many reading plans. great for all ages
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are simple and fun. My young children enjoy, some can be addicting :-) good free app. Excited to unlock some new games

B0056BU3I2|2.0|I ordered and received the blu ray on time but it would not play. It kept freezing up and one time it stopped and returned to the main menu on it's on. I contacted Amazon and they promptly returned my money including shipping and even provide a return lapel at their expense. I was not happy with the disc but I am very pleased as to how I was treated by Amazon and I continue to purchase from them. I just wish that everyone treated their customers with the same level of customer satisfaction that Amazon does. They are a very reputable site and I am very pleased with them. I shop their site all of the time and just recently bought Richy Rich and two car alarm remotes and they were top notch products.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a fantastic devotional and scheduled through the Bible reading tool.  having it read to me lets me &quot;read&quot; any time, no excuses for not reading the Bible.  thanks!
B00006CXSS|5.0|My son is a soldier at heart and this series was one of his favorite Christmas gifts.  Not much has to be said about this series than it is one of true brotherhood in a time when one questions such things.
B0051QJ83S|2.0|Unlike most of the reviews of \\"Born This Way\\" (and many other new releases), this was written after sitting with the album for nearly a year. Most of the noise, both pro and con, concerning Lady Gaga currently exists in the form of hastily ejaculated, poorly punctuated ranting. I write this for people who are truly curious about this album's sound, more specifically its place in the wider music world.<br /><br />Lady Gaga's been enjoying immense success and popularity recently, building a reputation among the mostly uncritical press as a daring and original multimedia \\"artiste.\\" I thought Poker Face was a smart and sassy pop song, and am still impressed with the theatrical sound of Bad Romance, but I've largely been underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's output. Generally, her stuff falls into one of two categories: 1) \\"not bad, but it doesn't really stand out,\\" or 2) \\"this sounds WAY too much like (past pop hit) for my comfort!\\" She's loads better than Katy Perry, and no worse than someone like Christina Aguilera, but I've never understood where the fanatical obsession came from. Perhaps this is simply reflective of contemporary music culture, specifically of listeners who have abandoned earlier generations' standards of greatness in performance, yet are still drawn like moths to the flame to worship anyone who happens to be in the spotlight, as if they were the next (past legend). Whatever it may be, the fact remains that \\"Born This Way\\" is a largely homogeneous, forgettable affair. Many of the cuts likely sizzle in the clubs, but staying power is not the order of the day.<br /><br />The album's strongest song is the opener, Marry the Night. The stomping beats and sleazy, buzzing synths make it a perfect club anthem. The problem is that, save for the modern production, it's just a by-the-numbers Eurodance anthem from the early '90s. It's practically begging to have a corny rap interlude (eg: \\"gonna marry the night, cuz it feels so right; when I drive in my car, I look up at the stars,\\" etc). It's fun, but I've largely heard it before...<br /><br />From there, it's more familiar territory. The title track is a shameless rip of Madonna's Express Yourself (Madonna herself called it \\"reductive\\"), Edge of Glory sounds a hundred other Cher-styled disco stompers, Government Hooker is a lesser version of Britney's Gimme More, and Judas just \\"sounds WAY too much like (Bad Romance) for my comfort.\\" Most of the other songs are embarrassing exercises in style (Americano, You & I), rehashes of other songs on the album (Bloody Mary), or just nondescript dancefloor filler. Scheisse is kind of fun, but I doubt I'll ever think to play it a few years from now.<br /><br />The production is well done, but over the course of the entire album, it feels very samey, with almost no contrast or breathing room available. The net result is a competent, effervescent pop experience that, while great for the dancefloor, is wearisome and not likely to endure the test of time.<br /><br />It's obvious that Gaga has some talent, but this album shows no growth from her debut, only amplification. There may eventually be an album in her career that finally pulls me into her orbit of adoring moths, but this one isn't it.It's fun, but I've largely heard it before...

B000E5N6LG|3.0|I purchased this movie as a gift for a freind of mine. they are into older western movies and cowboy movies. I have not seen this movie.
1932100660|5.0|This book is very insightful.  I put off reading it because I thought it would be dry & boring, but it wasn't.  I highly recommend it to anyone who's confused about what's healthy and what's not.
B006SV2LWA|1.0|This movie is so slow and boring.   With all the big names I expected more but it fell flat, it was terrible.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This CD is great.  I loved every song on it.  I got a great deal on it when I purchased it too.  Must buy!
0446563048|4.0|This book is really just a book about the culture of Zappos. If that's what you're looking for then it's a good buy. If you're looking for him to go into detail about how you can fully create the culture yourself then this may not be the book.  As I was reading the book I was thinking about how effective this book would be if I was a brand spanking new employee for Zappos learning about the visionary of the company, the mission, and what they stood for. Either way, I would still recommend you read this because I'm sure you'll pick up something from this excellent success story.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great for sharing between computer and kindle. I use it for recipes, directions, shopping lists and to do lists.  favorite new app.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Good game to pass the time. nothing special. Sucks that you cant quit midway, or save to continue later. Oh well.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use, but lots of features if you need of want more.  Everything the average person needs.  The radar button is a nice feature. Really easy to go from a daily forcast to a 15 day, then to an hour by hour. Great weather app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has given me the opportunity to read the Bible in a year with a broad selection of plans. It keeps me on track and its even reminds me daily.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the best game on a ipod it cool it so good game it real good so so so so best
B000H6SXMY|4.0|I love watching \\"Friends\\" while I'm doing laundry or household chores. It's something I have watched enough times that it is still entertaining and familiar enough that I don't have to be glued to the t.v. so I don't miss anything. If you are a \\"Friends\\" fan, I highly recommend this set. Each season box has the show title for each episode, and I love the whole title \\"The One Where....\\" Definitely a good buy, though personally I bought the set for sixty dollars on sale at a used video shop. I would say that you probably have to be a pretty big fan to buy the whole series though, otherwise you pay a lot of money for a set you may only watch once or twice. That's just my opinion though!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|super awesome game! good graphics. no.complaints. hours of fine family fun. keeps kids entertained!!!! bright Colorado.. couldn't believe it was free!!! two thumbsu p
B00006RAKP|5.0|My husband and I ordered the Elton John greatest hits 1970-2002.  It is an awesome collection of songs that when played we find we know all the words.  Funny how it all comes back! Even our kids who are adults now love the old stuff!!
B000002HMH|5.0|The lead singers of metal's two heaviest bands, Pantera and Slayer, trashed this album big-time. Pantera's Phil Anselmo laughed on stage at a Dallas Pantera show about how much he thought the album sucked, and Slayer's Tom Araya said Metallica was breaking their fans hearts with this album that he labeled as a complete band sellout. Keep in mind these are the singers of two bands that only barely changed their sound over the years and didn't show much musical growth.  The biggest complaint about \\"Load\\" was that it was Metallica giving in to the grunge era and becoming a grunge band, themselves. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Dokken and their few open-minded fans had to deal with the same widespread complaint about Dokken's extremely underrated and diverse album \\"Shadowlife\\" that was released in 1997. Just because these two bands came out with a new sound in the middle of the grunge phenomenon doesn't mean they were making grunge, themselves.  With that said, \\"Load\\" is insane, scary, loud, powerful, addictive, and a huge kick in the ass of previous Metallica thrash found on albums such as \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\". Those older albums were very original and broke open the world of metal in a huge way, but the songs were empty of soul and based on just technical brilliance. James Hetfield must have walked into the studio as a man possessed when Metallica recorded \\"Load\\". His vocals and guitar riffs on this album came from a power source that could be equated with inner hellfire.  There's not a dud on this album. It's a complete improvement and upward abandonment from their previous \\"Black Album\\". \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" is a great opener for \\"Load\\" with an instant kick from all four members' instruments right when it starts that doesn't let up. \\"King Nothing\\" lifts the driving riff of \\"Enter Sandman\\" into new heights, and the song's guitar power is matched wonderfully by Lars' equally heart-pounding drums. Hetfield's vocals on this track are downright threatening in their warning and sarcasm towards a worthless power figure. Hetfield is even more threatening with sarcasm in \\"Poor Twisted Me\\", mocking some whiner who he's fed up with, just like the \\"king\\" in \\"King Nothing\\"... there comes a point in the song where things get so chaotic instrumentally and vocally that you just hear Hetfield screeching in a muffled, noisy musical environment at whoever this target of his attack is, and you pray that James never gets sick of you. The album's two singles (which can both be found on karaoke lists everywhere), \\"Hero of the Day\\" and \\"Until it Sleeps\\", should have THRILLED Metallica fans with the fact that this band can combine sheer metal with pure songwriting. Too many fans reacted to these songs with distaste, simply because they are actual SONGS... but how can one complain when you get to bang your head and sing along at the same time? I personally think these two singles proved the band DIDN'T sell out, because both tracks are still both just as heavy as anything the band had written before this.  The album's two long masterpieces, \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"The Outlaw Torn\\", demand the attention of entire cities, whether their inhabitants like metal or not. One time I cranked the chorus of \\"Bleeding Me\\" out of my car while driving, and a girl walking down the road, who must have been a fan, almost collapsed in shock and excitement at what she was hearing. The bridge at the end of the song lends itself to fist-pumping more than any other rock song I've ever heard. Hetfield's voice oscillates on these two songs from quiet and beautiful to loud and articulate. When his booming voice articulates, it resembles a carpenter slowly, but mightily hammering a giant nail into a giant coffin with a giant hammer. It is a wonderful thing, and his eventual wolf-like howling at the end of both songs begs for a rewriting of the term \\"climax\\".  I'm more than acquainted with Metallica's catalog released before this album, and I've seen enough of them live to know that their studio work on this album is far and away their greatest achievement. I wouldn't call it an experimental album like \\"And Justice For All\\" was, and I simply label it as a fantastic heavy metal album that contains actual song composition. They'd always been innovative and heavy, but those two traits shouldn't have left metal fans not craving something like \\"Load\\".
B00004XPPC|5.0|This film is one of the great war films because it does more than present blood and gore.  It is a film about what defeat is, and how one can turn even the most terrible defeats into victories.  Now, this film's ending is so very significant to the plot that it must be discussed, so I'm throwing up a big spoiler warning right now.  ----SPOILER ALERT-----   The ending is so very brilliant, because it showcases the duty of a soldier.  All along Alec Guinness has been helping the Japanese build a bridge because it gave his men something to do and made them feel like proper soldiers.  But when he finally meets the commando's sent to destroy it, he suddenly realizes what he has done.  In his dying moments, Alec Guinness blows up the bridge, and what this shows us of his character is astounding.  That for all his talk, he knows what needs to be done.  And what a trip up to that point.  Every actor's performance is top notch, from Sessue Hayakawa's Saito to William Holden's Shears, they all feel real and believable.  The bridge, (which was actually constructed) is amazing.  For a film that essentially all about a bunch of guys building a bridge, it is very compelling.  Leaving the audience with a good picture of what it really takes, deep down, to be a commander of men.  Over all, an excellent film.  Every aspect of this film feels epic, and it is.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Fast shipping. Everything I expected. Great experience overall. Great price. Easily found through search box. Best of all, we love this movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great to play to pass the time and keep your mind at ease when stressed. Easy games and progression make it so simple to play.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|AH!!! I love this CD!! It's just amazing!! I love Kelly Clarkson her music is so powerful and uplifting! Really makes you feel! I recommend for everyone to buy this CD! :D
0307891372|5.0|This book is a MUST have, and simply fantastic!  The amount of information on playing the game, and all the aspects of the games itself are throughly covered.  I can't begin to imagine the amount of time and effort that went into creating a book of this magnitude!  This is a guide that you will constantly refer to as you work your way through all the Quests, and want to find answers about all the many things you can do within this amazing game!  Buy it!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I got the game free and haven't updated, so I can't speak to that. I think it's a fun, sometimes frustrating and challenging time filler.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is assome it meets all my wants and is very good for people that like to earn and spend credits
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Man in taxi cab accident awakens in hospital to discover who he thought he was is nothing but a figment of his imagination... or so they want him to believe. Even his own wife denies he is who he is. (Now that I think of it, reminds me of Total Recall a little, without the sci-fi twist). I thought the suspense was well done, and the acting and filmography perfect. Action, mystery, suspense, intrigue... it's all there. Worth the watch.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|As a mom of two teens who LOVE war games--these are great.  They love them and think the sound quality is great.  But the best part is that I do not have to listen to the  shooting and games stuff.
B005VMVUAQ|5.0|I don't understand the bad reviews. This movie 'Trespass' with Nicole Kidman and Nicholas Cage has had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Everytime I thought I had the answer to what was going on and knew what the story was I found there was another twist. It was well worth the $7.99 I paid for it and had I seen it at the theater I would have felt the $10.00 ticket price was worth it too. Rare to say now-a-days.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good, simple fun. Short rounds make it a good game for when you need to burn small segments of time off. Good game, worth the $0.99!! :-)
B001TODCII|5.0|The movie doesn't take long to start putting the viewer on the edge of their seat. Right away I knew something bad was goign to happen. Daughter goes on european trip with friends, first time away from home, dad is very leery about letting daughter out of his sight worried about all of the horrible things he knows can happen to young girls... and his concerns come to fruition when she is abducted. Great keep you on the edge of your seat type of movie with lots of action and intrigue. Worth the watch.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I'm Glad I could find this cd It Rocks.  It came really quick during the holiday season.  It was a good find I am happy with it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|kindle fire, simple mechanics but addicting. I like being able to level up the misspent launcher. this adds a nice depth to gameplay.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is an incredible Bible app. there are so many features. most importantly,  I read my Bible a lot more because I have it. simply seeing the widget on my homepage reminds me dozens of times every day to keep up with my reading plan. everyone needs to have this app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thought the first book was good, but this one just doubles up on it.  Buying number 3 now.  Sucked in like no tomorrow!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game n easy to play. VERY ADDICTING!!! I finally reached lvl 20 then got a game over :(. Works great on phone n no force shut so thats another plus.
B000YABYLA|1.0|Boreing!!!! This movie from my sister in law at her advice. Could not have been more bored with it. For a teenage that thanks and talks like she is 30, she doesn't seem to have a brain in her skull. If you really want to be bored half to death this movie is for you. My advice rent or borrow it before wasting money on it. The script is so dry you could use it to start a fire with it. My husband and I got half way through it before we shut it off.
0385342063|5.0|I'm a huge Sophie Kinsella fan and I would say this book is probably one of her very best.  The main character is a girl named Poppy and the story centers around what happens to her after her cell phone is stolen and then she finds another phone in a trash can at an event at a hotel.  Turns out the phone is an important company phone that was thrown away by a personal assistant.  Poppy starts answering the calls and texts and next thing you know, she's all wrapped up in the office politics, etc. of the company the phone belongs to.  At the same event she loses her engagement ring, and since her phone is stolen, she starts using the phone she found to contact the people she was with to see if they've seen her ring. So, the story centers around this phone that ties Poppy to both the company - and the man the assistant worked for - and to her lost ring.<br /><br />The man she's engaged to is from a family of intellectuals, and Poppy is like all the main characters of Sophie's books, interested in fashion, gossip, etc and the interactions between her fiance's eccentric family and her are just hilarious. Since she's also caught up in the business of the company phone, she starts getting interested in the man she has to relay messages to.  He's a serious businessman, but he's nice and lets her keep the phone while she's looking for her ring.<br /><br />The two stories intertwine throughout the book , and I'm sure you can guess that Poppy starts to fall for the man who owns the phone.  It starts to become obvious towards the end which man she'll end up with, but there is enough suspense to make you really want to get to the end to find out who it is.  I loved the story and laughed all the way through it and cried with happiness a little bit at the end.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|There are many Bibles available as apps, but this one offers many versions, audio in some places, and what I like best, reading plans. The readings are what keep.me.reading the Bible every day. Although I wish using the.plans were a little smoother when offline (acts as if it cannot work).
1594744769|5.0|What an amazing story. I have just finish being in this world and I didn't want to leave it. I wish I was a peculiar child. Emma is my favorite peculiar... I can't wait for the sequel to be part of this amazing world once more.... The pictures are amazing!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|works great on kindle fire. I think this will b a great game for my son when he gets older.
B006MGDIAA|5.0|The author has done an excellent job of providing examples for almost every component of the Cocos 2D library. This is not a book for complete novicies, but if you have any experience writing code then there is something here for you. It is like it says, a cookbook, and provides a great jumping off place for pursuing your own ideas. If you are comfortable writing code but are new to the Cocos2d library then this is the book you have been looking for.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very fun and addictive, but you wont play for long before it gets nearly impossible to play. An option for difficulty levels might increase playing time, or different scenes. Also, building expansion might be interesting.
B0058VW36U|4.0|its fun and all but the levels r like wat to freaking easy but amazon is solo freaking anoing and slow at fitting new levels!!!!!!!!:/

B003EYVXXW|4.0|This film does take liberty with the historical record.  It's tempting to imagine the burning of the library and the lynching of Hypatia as the culture performing an intellectual suicide, moving the world from the wisdom of antiquity to the fear and ignorance of the dark ages, not to be dispelled until the Renaissance.  In one of his books, Carl Sagan described it in just this way.  It would seem that the library was so monumental as to require a cataclysmic explanation for its disappearance.<br /><br />The first accusation, barely remembered now, was to blame Julius Caesar for burning the library.  Apparently Caesar was trapped in Alexandria, and fired the harbor to excape, resulting in the accidental burning of a few books when the flames spread.  But the library obviously was still around for centuries after this.<br /><br />There is also no evidence that the early Christians burned the library, either, as evidence clearly shows many books surviving after this period as well.  What happened is that as tastes and interests changed, many of the works considered \\"pagan\\" were deemed not worth the effort of copying, so as the ink faded and the papyrus disintegrated, these works were lost.  Later, when Alexandria was under Moslem control, the Christian works suffered the same fate, with the result that the library gradually succumbed to the ravages of time, its contents gradually disappearing.  Yet many works did survive, there and in other places, in copies and translations by Christian and Moslem scholars.  If they had not, the Renaissance itself - a rediscovery and reapplication of the art and science of antiquity - may never have happened.<br /><br />The film's ending seems to imply that had Hypatia been allowed to live and continue her work, science would have been advanced 1,200 years, and the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\" (more properly, the Early Middle Ages) might possibly have been avoided.  I have wondered the same thing about Archimedes, who was reportedly on the verge of discovering Calculus when he was mistakenly killed by a soldier who was only supposed to capture him.  Had he been allowed to live, maybe we would already be in the world of Star Trek by now.  This thinking suggests that history is advanced by intelligent, powerful, or charismatic individuals with big ideas.<br /><br />We tend to accept this explanation because history does seem to be advanced by such individuals, who tend to take center stage.  After all, if George Washington and King George III had never lived, would the United States still be a colony of Great Britain today?  But this ignores the zeitgeist, where the masses of a particular time make a collective decision to move in a certain direction.  In Hypatia's time, her brand of inquiry was on the wane - it had no place in the new society that was developing, where knowledge was based on personal revelation rather than objective observation.  Even if she had survived and published her supposed discoveries, they really would have been a thousand years ahead of their time.  There was no audience for them, in other words, so they would have been ignored, or at best a mere curiosity.  And one benefit of this is that atomic weapons were developed in the 1940s, not the 740s.<br /><br />Science is not a disparate collection of facts - it is more like a jigsaw puzzle.  New pieces must fit into the existing ones, which can be modified or even discarded, but the entire picture is difficult to erase.  This may be why research into psychic phenomena seems so crackpot - it doesn't fit into the existing paradigm.  It may also be why great discoveries are sometimes made by completely separate and disconnected people at the same time - they are not sui generis, but are logical developments of the current scientific culture.  Hypatia's \\"discoveries\\" in this film were not the beginning of anything; they were the tail end.  It is fun to speculate, \\"what would have happened, if...\\"  But we would still be in the same place we are now.<br /><br />Leopold Bloom<br />\\"Thoughts thunk while thinking\\"ace we are now.<br /><br />Leopold Bloom<br />\\"Thoughts thunk while thinking\\"

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is Marissa Meyer's debut novel, and in this readers opinion she knocked the ball out of the park for a Grand Slam home run.  Cinder offers a futuristic, steampunk re-telling of the fairytale Cinderella. The world-building is magical with amazing characters and a plot that has endless possibilities.  Meyer's writing style is lovely and the tale was beautifully written. While some of the tale is very predictable Meyer's creates a storyline and world that are both unique and fascinating.<br /><br />Cinder takes place in the Eastern Commonwealth capital of New Beijing sometime after WW IV. After the war, the people elected a king to govern them.  While this is a peaceful time on earth, it is not without problems. A plague called Letumosis is infecting people throughout the world.  I found the way in which they handled the ill, deplorable. However, I had to keep in mind the size of the city and the rapidness with which spread. As if this crisis isn't enough they are dealing with another enemy.  The moon is inhabited by aliens known as Lunar. They are ruled by Queen Levana who is constantly threatening war with Earth. The king has been trying to negotiate a treaty for years but the Queen wants something he has been unwilling to give. The Queen wishes to form an alliance through marriage thus ensuring her rise to power. She wants to marry, Prince Kai the king's successor.  This modern world is filled with futuristic hover crafts, communications, and embedded identification sensors used for trade and tracking. The people have robots to perform duties and have healed the injured with cyborg technologies; thus created human cyborgs.  Sadly, they are considered second class citizens and they are even being drafted by the government as test subjects for research in finding a cure for the plague.<br /><br />The characters in this novel are delightful. Let me begin with Cinder. She is part cyborg. Her hand and part of her leg below the knee are completely mechanical. She has built in sensors, programs and a plate in the back of her head. She was in a horrific hover accident that killed her parents. When she was eleven she was adopted by a man and moved to New Beijing. Shortly after her arrival, the man died, leaving her with a step-mother and two step-sisters. The mother doesn't like cyborgs and treats her like a servant. She is unable to accept that Cinder has any human feelings.  Cinder is the type of protagonist you can easily connect to. She is bright, honest, strong, snarky and independent.  I quickly became invested in her story.  Cinder's only true companion is a bot called Iko. I adored Iko. Her programming, considered defective, makes her sarcastic and I laughed at the interactions between them. Prince Kai is a delightful, sensitive and caring young man. He shows wisdom beyond his years, and yet can still act like a smitten teen.  A character you will love to hate is Queen Levana and she oozes evil. She is selfish, childish, intolerant and greedy. She demands complete power and respect.  I will spend this series waiting for her to get her just desserts.<br /><br />The romance between Cinder and Prince Kai is sweet and for once we do not have a YA-novel serving up insta-love. Kudos to Meyer for letting the relationship build the old-fashion way. The relationship faces numerous complications which only makes it all the more delightful.  I look forward to seeing their relationship develop.<br /><br />Cinder is fast paced, and I finished it the same day I started. I became completely immersed in the tale and the outside world melted away.programs and a plate in the back of her head. She was in a horrific hover accident that killed her parents.

B004GYY714|1.0|This thing did not work  it loaded  on my phone ok but It never played one word from the time I loaded it until I removed it.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game is everything the 5 star raters say it is... its pretty fun for a bit and is a good version of this game.  The reason I give it 3 stars is that you have to play 25ish levels before it even starts to resemble w challenge.  By the time you get to level 30 or so you have nothing more to upgrade and it starts to get boring.  It does get pretty fast and challenging in the 30s but just takes too long to get there.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg. In a world where this is not entirely uncommon, Cinder is treated as sub-human, shunned by those around her. Ashamed of her mechanical parts, Cinder keeps her hands covered with gloves, her feet behind tables. True to the originally Cinderella story, Cinder is a mechanic to the public, and the only source of income to her uncaring and selfish step mother.<br /><br />Cinder has a terrific world that we slowly see unfold. In this alternate reality a plague is spreading. Unknowing of the cause or the cure to this deadly disease, plague victims are quickly quarantined away from their families and loved ones. War is also eminent as the Lunar race has waited for just the right moment for Earth to be at its weakest to strike.<br /><br />Cinder is an interesting twist on the typical Cinderella story. With worries beyond the normal 'will I go to the ball?' we get a much more complex character who is easy to identify with. I found myself cheering for her even when I was frustrated with the occasionally slow moving story. With large amounts of foreshadowing, Cinder could sometimes be frustrating as I just wanted the book to get on with it already. Despite this, the slow pace of Cinder and Kai's relationship made the story feel much more realistic and believable.<br /><br />I loved watching the relationship between Kai and Cinder unfold, because it is a much more reluctant and ashamed of who she is Cinder that is sought out by Kai. For Kai, Cinder is a breath of fresh air - untouched by court politics, Cinder is someone he can speak to without being judged, and for his self and not who everyone thinks he should be.<br /><br />Beyond the 'love story' however, is a much more political story then we often see for the Young Adult audience, as the choices between doing what's right for yourself and what you should do for your people becomes much blurrier. I am extremely eager to see the universe continue to expand.

0525478817|5.0|This review is just going to be a gush-fest, I know it.<br /><br />John Green is a writer that has yet to disappoint. His words hold more power than any other author's work that I've had the pleasure of reading. I love all of his books, this one taking first place, and recommend them all to anyone willing to listen. The Fault in Our Stars is a hopeful journey, taking a twist that I didn't see coming, and with enough emotion to make anyone feel for these characters.<br /><br />Augustus and Hazel's story is one of my favorites, probably my favorite. And, I must add, I have never before cried so much in a single book, but I knew going into it that I would be crying like a baby.<br /><br />Hazel is living on borrowed time, but she isn't really living. She doesn't have friends, at least not any that understand what she's going through, until she gives a boy with a gorgeous smile a chance. Augustus is a charming and worthy candidate of Hazel. Together they discover so much about themselves and the world around them. Augustus teaches Hazel how to go for things and together they live.<br /><br />I love Augustus' attitude, he was always making me smile. I have so many favorite parts of this book and I feel like everyone should read it and find their own favorites, but I love Augustus. Everything about him makes me grin. He's an amazing amazing person and friend and I hope to one day know someone with his remarkable attitude and witty humor. He and Hazel have this way to talk to each other back and forth that is adorable banter. If for nothing read this book for that.<br /><br />It's the kind of book that makes me want to get up and do something extremely meaningful with my life. I think it will make any reader reevaluate the things they love and those they take for granted. There is so much more to this story and all I want to say is READ IT, read all of John's work because frankly, what have you got to lose?<br />I Love, Love, Love it
B0063IH60K|4.0|works great, only down side is the ad between games try.....rate .....like.....tweet.... the app itself is fine and works well
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you know when your sitting there, thinking about clouds and stuff, and your dog comes and cuts the cheese near you and you can sorta taste it in your mouth?  this game beats that any day of the week.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fits great.  Low profile.  Seems durable.  A little expensive, but what isn't these days.  I don't have a complaint at all really.
0757302661|5.0|I researched information about natural childbirth from the beginning of my pregnancy. I knew that it was for me. A freind recommended this method to me. I read several different books and this was one of my favorites. I had less than 10 minutes of pain during my birth experience, and my entire labor was only a few hours. It was a wonderful because I went into my labor FEARLESS! I loved the visualization, relaxation and breathing techniques in the book, although I did not use all of them. For example the rainbow relaxation didn't help me. The book introduces a lot of tools to help you during labor and you can pick and choose what works for you.  I also let a friend borrow the book. She had a wonderful birthing experience also.
B0052VI2V6|5.0|I missed out on the dvd-audio version of this album when it was released a few years ago. Most reviewers seem to believe that Warners Japan have transferred this over without any further re-mastering. Anyway I have played the cd a few times and must say that the sound quality is really excellent. I have also just bought Fleetwood Mac's Rumours in the same format and this is equally as good in my opinion.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The UI on this app is great. It runs smoothly and is mostly accurate. It looks amazing on the Kindle and is super helpful. Overall I love it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is truly a precious movie that I hold dearly in my heart.  I definitely recommend it.  After watching this movie, I started watching Miyazaki's other movies, and all of them are just as amazing.  Miyazaki's movies are very refreshing, and they always make me feel better.  When something in my life is hard, I watch one of his movies, and I feel like I can deal with anything that comes my way, and more.  I realize not everyone will feel the same way, but do at least give this movie a try!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you're a fan of \\"How I Met Your Mother\\", than you will love this. It is just downright hilarious.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|There is little that I can say that has not already been said by the press and listener reviews. Of course, I am absulutely floored. Chris Cornell is the undisputed vocal master of his time and one of the greats of all time. He is one of my most deeply appreciated artists. And I am eternally grateful. So, that said, I want to weigh in on the masterul production. Hats off to the guys behind the board. Impeccable. Every vocal nuance, from quiet rasp to stratospheric scream, are caught in sparkling detail. The guitar is clarion clear. The capture of the live acoustics of the room are spot on. Without a doubt the finenest of live recordings. Thank providence that they were there to capture a master in his finest hour.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I haven't seen it myself yet, but the kids really enjoyed the movie. They must have, because they sat through the whole thing even with they'r friends over watching with them! With Blu-ray picture and sound quality, how can you go wrong?
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Classic missile defense with income and a repair/upgrade phase between levels. Polished, solid, and fun. Would be five stars, but it still lacks the same level of polish expected now. No animations when buildings are hit, and the sound isn't the best.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun until about level 30 when you break a sweat trying to save the city from all the bombs and missiles!
B005XQLBU4|2.0|super hard but a little fun I guess.... its impossible to get enough credits to upgrade stuff and its hard to gauge where the missiles go
B005TTEFRG|1.0|Having grown up with the Arnold version of Conan, as well as the comics, I had high expectations from this movie, given that it's about 30 years later.  The original not only had Arnold, but James Earl Jones as the enemy.  Now while Jason Momoa looked the part, his voice didn't match the character.  I expected not only a slightly deeper voice (like the one he uses in Game of Thrones) but, I don't know, MAYBE an accent?  Also speak a little slower, it's not a race to finish your lines.  Maybe knowing how badly the movie was going to turn out, they felt they had to get through their lines fast in order to get out of there.    And the people who watched it before release...you were OK with it??    I'd avoid buying this movie and just rent it if you want to watch it....or better yet rent the Arnold versions.  This only succeeded in making me want to watch those older movies anyway.
1451648537|3.0|For those with no real knowledge of Steve Jobs, this is a really great book. Rather than go over all the great things about it, I'm going to go over the negatives. What I was really interested in reading about was Steve's time between his stints at Apple. There isn't much at all covered here. There are a few pages where he says Pixar was in trouble, and then they created Toy Story and it was great.   Near the end of the book, it also attempts to demonize Microsoft at any period. There is a part where he is talking about what Balmer said after the iPhone launch. The author smuggly states immediately after how many iPhones Apple sold. The problem is that Balmer was making a comment when the iPhone launched at $600, when most phones sold for $200, and there is no mention of this. There was also no mention of the immediate price decrease of the iPhone.   The second to last chapter of the book is rather random too, it seems to be where stories which weren't large enough for the rest of the book were thrown, and it also seems to be put in because the author read the book, realized it shows Steve Jobs was fairly crazy and mean, and now he has to make him seem like a good guy. I believe this is the additional bit they added right before it was released. Near the end of the book, every chapter only says how great Jobs is, rather than really delving into the issues they may have had with the iPhone or iPad.  The book also goes backwards and forwards constantly, making it difficult to keep track of what is going on.   While it was an interesting book, I wouldn't call it enjoyable. My main issue is just how much of an ass Steve was to many, for no reason, and I really can't deal with that from someone who is as revered as him. I hope that others who look at the good he did do not take this from his track record.
0307292134|3.0|The series has marvelous character and scene developement.  The beings, both living and dead, are vivid and real.  The world they live in is alive even in it's fantasy.  It's fault is complexity for the sake of complexity and length for the sake of length.  It is so full of twists and turns in the plot that it is wearying.  There is cliff hanger after cliff hanger.  The story lines intertwine back and forth so much that it's hard to keep up with them.  By the time you finish the last book in the series, that one that follows the four in this set you can't remember what was written in the first books or how those stories relate.  Some story lines end with a thud, some just fade away, a few seem to be brought to some normal end, while some major story lines have no resolution at all.  Actually, after the fifth book, there seems a need for a sixth volume to bring all the loose ends together and actually supply an ending to the story.  The trouble with that is I don't think that I would have the energy left to read it.  I am tired of the story  This series is colorful and vivid in the telling but not worth the energy it takes to slog one's way through it.  It's about two books too long and still seems incomplete.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Spent a good while recalling the 80s thanks to this. Gameplay is smooth and responsive, graphics fun, and nostalgia thick. FYI: touch controls &gt; trackball! Was free, but worth a pay.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This wa a great deal for the price.  I shopped around and could only find a one-disc version for a higher price. Thanks Amazon!
B00006JSS8|2.0|With this one-of-the-best heartbreaking love song of all time absent, you shameless call it this collection \\"definitive\\"? If not fraud, it's definitely misleading.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I got it for the diet and I lost 18 pounds in one month.  I've also kept it off for six months.  Its helped me confront my sugar dependancy and cut my need / want for carbs.  Like he says in the book, take what you will from it.  But if you have an open mind and a little determination, you can get fast results and feel a better quality of life from it.  I didn't think this book need more support, but after reading some negative reviews I wanted to share my good experience with it.  I hope you enjoy and have great results too.

B005LAIGLE|3.0|Not an award winner, but this movie was ok and I enjoyed it.  As another reviewer said, \\"Forgettable [movie] but fun while it lasted.\\"  It is about smuggling/running drugs and counterfeit money.<br /><br />Scene 1 of this adventure begins in the harbor.  As a cargo ship is coming in, the police and Customs are swarming around in choppers.  Young Andy dumps 10 bricks of coke before the Customs agents board the ship.<br /><br />Scene 2 switches over to a wedding reception, where we meet Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) and his wife Kate (Kate Beckensale).  Farraday used to be a runner himself, but he got out of it and became legitimate.  Chris started his own business, Farraday Security Systems.<br /><br />When the bad guys show up at the harbor for their package, young Andy tells them he had to dump it.  It's a no-brainer that the bad guys bust Andy up, primarily a guy named Briggs.  Andy calls his sister, Kate Farraday, from the hospital.  Since Chris still has ties to the bad guy network, he meets up with Briggs and tries to talk.  But Briggs just wants his money, and tells Chris that the debt belongs to Andy AND his whole family.<br /><br />In order to make some big money quickly and protect his wife and children, and to try to help Andy, Chris gets temporarily back into the business, traveling to Panama and back to New Orleans.  As you might expect, things are not as easy as Chris thought they would be.<br /><br />The movie held my interest the entire time.  It was interesting and had a decent amount of action.  Wahlberg was in the typical type role I see him in -- tough guy/protect what's mine/get even.  Beckensale's role was blah.  (Not her fault, the character had little to do except scream.) It is probably a movie I would watch only once.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really really great!! you should try it!!!you will absolutely love it!!! you will have a lot of fun playing it!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun and easy games. you can quickly earn points unlock more games. great for passing the time, and kids enjoy as well
B000000H3W|5.0|Roots, Chaos AD and Beneath the Remains are good too but Arise is their best moment. The songs are more melodic and memorable than Beneath the Remains, but it's also faster and heavier than Chaos AD or Roots. They slow their songs down just a little and get to the right pace and speed. It doesn't have as much tribal influences as Chaos AD but it has some and shows a sign of change. It's a little more complex and unique than their earlier stuff. It's less death metal and more thrash, Arise takes the best of old and new Sepultura and it's the turning point in their career.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|i liked this game. good for passing the time. the upgrade system for your missiles was a great idea. worth the money.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Rob Halford is back and it's his first album with Judas Priest since 1990 Painkiller. Angel of Retribution takes them back to their early '80s roots. It's even better than Painkiller in my opinion and that's saying a lot. Painkiller was an excellent return in 1990, Judas Priest were reborn and it was a complete surprise to all of their fans. However, Angel Of Retribution is such an awesome comeback that it even surpasses Painkiller. It's the best that I've heard since Defenders Of the Faith, that's over 2 decades and it's amazing that they can still be this good after being over 30 years old.<br />It's a mix of a little bit of everything throughout their catalog but it sounds a lot like their late '70's and early '80s-era. It's progressive and technical but not extremely complex and technical. It's also accessible but not extremely commercial or pop influenced. Production is great and the songs have a bit of a more modernized sound to them, they kept their songs up to date and that's why they have so many classics throughout the years.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just Dl it. so cant say if I like it yet. don't know what else to say. really really don't know what else to say.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|Piper at The Gates of Dawn is an excellent album by Pink Floyd but the production was always a bit dated. The remastered has a more dynamic and cleaner sound. Personally, I think it's their best album right after Dark Side Of the Moon and one of my favorite albums of all time. It's a bit different from their more popular albums, it's more psychedelic rock than progressive. I never understood why their early stuff is so overlooked, Syd Barrett was a great songwriter and vocalist. However, Piper is the only album that he fully contributed to and he had to leave the band in '68 due to mental illness. The band started to fall apart but Piper will always be a masterpiece in my opinion no matter what time it is. My personal favorites are The Scarecrow, Chapter 24 and Flaming but all of the songs are good.

0307891402|4.0|I bought this guide to help me play through Skyrim. I don't get a lot of time to play anymore so i bought this so i only had to play it once. This book is very detailed and is a great help, BUT it is missing quests and missing certain unique items. I have also found they have some of the Items property listed wrong. The Wabbajack for example the book says it turns targets into something else. That is not the only thing it does. It does anything to turning your enemy into a mud crab to healing them to making them vanish to an instant kill. I still do believe this book is very good but they may have lacked the time to proof everything. Possibly because the game has so much content or because they wanted to get it shipped out and start making the money. All and all the book is still worth it just has a few errors
B005GVA2L0|5.0|Excellent CD  One of the best work the band evanescence,excellent vocals, heavy  I found it much better than other works of the band

B0059XTUVI|5.0|I did not expect to see anyone portray so thoroughly Margaret Thatcher as an elderly woman, right down to the walking gait and facial expressions that so clearly revealed her conflicting emotions as she looked back on her life and missed the loves of her life who got lost in the demands upon her as a political figure, still mixed with the fervor of a strong self forged in the fire. From the father who inspired her politically strong convictions and educational aspirations, to the warm-hearted husband who believed in her leadership and whose support gave her the courage to take ever bolder steps in leadership, this poignant story is profoundly acted by Meryl Streep. It touched me on so many levels--as an idealist, as a mother, as a woman whose career took her away from her family, as the daughter of a woman who is dealing with the onset of dementia and difficulty separating the past from the present. Margaret Thatcher's inner resoluteness matched the crises she had to face so bravely for so long, propelling her into history and onto the world stage, increasingly taking a toll on her till she mistakenly assumed those loyal to her party would always be loyal to her. The flashbacks are a realisitic experience of world history at the time, with actual news footage in the mix. This is not a biography. You FEEL what Margaret Thatcher felt, you SEE what she saw, you step inside the soul of the person and emerge changed in how you look at your own life.
0300169787|5.0|This book is fantastic!!! A must in all the homes of pople interested in fashion or arts!! Its full of great photographs with nice close ups and full information about the carrer of this great designer !!! Already one of my favs!!!

B005IGVYUG|1.0|I have been a Waits fan for near 40 years now.  Much to my dismay..this CD was a great disappointment.  I tried to keep an open mind as one must always do with Tom but I just did not enjoy the CD.  I have given it to three others to listen to and all of us are feeling the same vibe.  It would not stop me from buying his next CD but I highly suggest you preview each song before you purchase this.  Still loving Tom Waits.....

B004I8WLK2|5.0|This is a book for all European `baby-boomers'.  The author was born in 1948, as I was.  Anyone born in Europe since 1945 will enjoy it, especially if they have an eye for detail and an interest in politics.  `European' because the narrative is largely confined to that Continent, though Judt wrote in American English; but he painted on a wide canvas nonetheless - from Spain to the Urals and from Scandinavia to Greece.    If you are a baby-boomer and want to know the answer to the question of why the world was as it was, say in the 1960s, read this book.  Why did the Cold War `break out' in the first place?  Why was there a NATO and a Warsaw Pact?  Why was there détente and then renewed Cold War?  Why was there a West Germany and an East Germany?  Why was the Berlin Wall built?  You will find convincing answers here.  Then, moving on to middle age, why did the Eastern bloc fall apart?  Why did the Soviet Union collapse?  Why was Gorbachev such a failure in his own country?  Why did Communism fail?  Why did it not transform itself into `Socialism with a Human Face'?  Or again, why was it not replaced with something more Left-Wing, as many of the student radicals in the 1960s hoped?  Again, Judt provides an answer.  And again, why was there a `Common Market' and a `European Union'?  Why did Francois Mitterand turn from socialist to capitalist almost overnight?  Why did the Soviet Union allow Germany to re-unite?  Why were so many of the hopes of 1989-91 dashed so soon?  Why did Slovakia separate from Czechoslovakia?  Why did Yugoslavia fall apart so spectacularly?  It is a very profoiund as well as comprehensive book.  Judt wrote like an angel.  He was good on economics and culture as well as politics; but, if there is one lesson I took from the book, I suppose it is that, ultimately - and contrary to what Marx thought - politics is more important than economics.  Sadly, Judt died last year or the year before, from Motor-Neurone Disease.  It will be difficult for anyone else to equal his achievement.
B005HSL626|4.0|Not a bad app, it's fun with a lot of different achievements and Open Feint capability, but the ads do get annoying sometimes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun there are lots of games to play and most of them are really fun. if you are looking for games that are fun and challenging this is for you. : )
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use this alarm app every day to wake me up for military formations and for important meetings whenever I'm sleeping or need a reminder.   This app has never failed me. I got it as a \\"Free App of the Day\\" a while back, but I would pay $10 for this app because it does so much and never lets you down!   Get it! You will not be disappointed.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Wow!!! This was the best book so far. There were times I was like, \\"Okay, Rose, grow up a little bit quicker,\\" but that quickly faded as she did grow up. I learned so much about Rose in this book and I liked it. Liked her more in this book than I did the others.<br /><br />I guess that's part of the growth of the characters, right?<br /><br />Dimitri **le sigh** is a wonderfully crafted hero. I admire the depth Mead gave him. So complex, honorable, yet still a man!  Mead has done a masterful job creating these characters and weaving a wonderful plot that keeps me engaged to the point of losing much needed sleep.<br /><br />On to the next book. I can not wait to see how this unfolds.  I'm just glad the series is complete and I don't have to wait for the other ones to come out!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app allows you to control your computer from your phone/tablet as if you were on the computer itself.  It does definitely work, though the Gmail functionality didn't work for me. I will note that a desktop application must be downloaded and installed on your computer in order for this program to work.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|easy to play and hard to put down. great remake of old classic game.makes you react fast and plan your upgrades.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it keeps me occupied and all around it seems like a great game. I like it and I will reccomend it to my friends and everyone I know
B0040X46TE|5.0|I ordered this CD for the Over the Rainbow track, but I liked the other songs as well. I believe everyone will like it as well.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The ads displayed in this app were terrible. Loaded this game for my kids but was forced to uninstall once I saw the inappropriate (adult focused) content.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Not a bad little game.  Lots of tapping all over the screen type games.  Gets addicting when trying to unlock all the other games.  This is for the kindle fire, fyi.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|good remake. it gets challenging pretty quick. good graphics and easy controls. This 20 word min on the review really sux amazon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun!! I can't stop playing this game!!! I absolutely am in love with this game.I recommend that you download this game!!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a good remake of this classic game.  I only wish that there were upgrades to get new weapon types.  Also backgrounds could be better.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Very good variant of the classic game Missile Command. It's better than the original due to the accurate and responsive touch targeting. With better graphics obviously. Anyone who skips on this for free is just plain missing out. It would actually be worth paying for.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|*May contain spoilers* This is by far one of the best books I've ever read in my LIFE!!!!!!!!!!! Worth the money. I LOVED it. I DEVOURED it. I ADORED this book! The ending had me crying like a baby and I've never cried over a book in my life. Never. The ending was so heart wrenching. I refuse to believe Alex is dead. He's my favorite character and I don't know why (as brilliant of an author she is) Lauren Oliver would kill him like that. How could she do that to the readers?! But besides that, I loved this book. LOVED it. LOVED it. LOVED it.
0525478817|5.0|*No spoilers :)* The Fault in our Stars is a great addition to my book collection. John Green always delivers, and it is especially true with his newest book. I did not put this book down until I finished. My adventure with Gus and Hazel was a great one: I laughed, I cried, I had fun. TFioS is a moving in-sight into a different world. It may be a fictional story, but to me, there's someone in the world living that story. The story is literally perfect (incorrect use of literality?) and I don't think I'll need to search for a sequel to this one.
0553386794|5.0|I really should be reviewing other books--books that are coming out this month (there are so many fantastic ones). But I had to stop and talk about this book. I'm obsessed with this series. Have you read it? The first one came out in 2002, so I imagine a lot of people who like fantasy have already read it. Or, maybe you're like me and you watched the series on HBO, loved it, and wondered why you hadn't ever read the books, considering you love books and fantasy. Or maybe you haven't read this yet. Do it--but be sure to block out chunks of time because these books are long and detailed with many, many characters (don't worry, most of them are killed off within a chapter or two of their introduction).<br /><br />It's amazing, entrancing, horrifying, and, at times, difficult to read. The worldbuilding is incredible. It's an Earth-like world, medieval in time frame and beliefs, but with a hint of magic...just a hint, since it seems all magic died when the last dragon died. Told through a variety of different viewpoints--from the bastard son of a great lord to a princess in hiding to a young tomboy--the story seamlessly moves from the great frozen Wall that protects the Seven Kingdoms from what lies beyond to the indolent Kings Landing that basks in the South, telling the tale of deceit, courage, honor, and betrayal.<br /><br />This world, however, is not good to women. I've read a couple of places how the story is \\"true to its time\\". Really? Just because it's set in a medieval-style world doesn't mean women have to be chattel, sluts, whores, and pampered flowers sold to the highest bidder or richest lord. It's fantasy, which means the author could have done anything with his world.<br /><br />Still, the series has completely captured my attention and, until I get through the next three books (there are five total and I just devoured the second one), I fear I won't be much good for anything. Hey, good thing I have such a backlog of reviews!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app.  Use it on my phone, computer, kindle fire.  My wife and both use it to share to do lists.
B001AFF25W|1.0|Let's see:  8 yrs in the merchant marine, 1 year as a sales wonder, and 3 years as sales manager before becoming VP at age 25 ... so he must have gone to sea at age 13.  Pretty amazing guy!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book while simultaneously The Secret Holocaust Diaries of Nona Bannister.  Both were heartbreaking in their own way and it was interesting to see the war from the German and the Russian point of view through the eyes of two very special young girls.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I purchased this for my new grand daughter.  From the day my daughter brought her home from the hospital the baby spends 30 minutes to an hour just watching the critters go round.  She likes the Bach and Beethoven better than the Mozart.  She also is attentive to the jungle sounds.  Lights move, leave go up and down, remote to turn it on and off are really wonderful features.  The bright colors especially attract a baby's attention.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|brings back memories of missile command on the ole atari 2600! pretty fun game! worth it for free! I like the various upgrades you can do.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is really fun cuz u get freedom if ur anelgery its there for you to slice all the furits you love!!!!!!  XD
1594481717|5.0|This book makes such sense. Like it or not, many of the jobs and tasks that are considered \\"left brained\\" are now being performed in other countries or by computers. That, coupled with the need for meaning we develop as we gain an abundance of material things, means that the future requires a more \\"right-brained\\" approach. Daniel Pink tells this story in an interesting, convincing way, and he provides some great resources to investigate further.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing I love it!! this game provides me with weeks of entertainment I love it!! u should buy this game!!!
B006MPK9SU|5.0|I have never read a Michael Connelly book which I have not enjoyed and this is no different. I love Harry Bosch and how he is brought to life with brilliant writing by Connelly. Sometimes I wish the bad guys didn't just die but be brought to justice and have poor Harry celebrated for the great detective he is. 5 stars and looking forward to the next in the series.
B000YDPT4U|5.0|I love vinyl records.  I love Led Zeppelin.  But for me, the two don't mate well together.  I have the toughest time finding LZ on quality vinyl.  It's just tough to find copies that weren't played and played and played.  Same as Pink Floyd.  As such, the vinyl quality suffers.  That, compounded by the fact that these albums were recorded way back when, it's a daunting task.  My father's record collection would have been worth a fortune if they were mint, only he did what most of us do.....he played and he played.  Can't fault someone for listening to their music i guess.  So when i saw this compilation on heavy duty vinyl, remastered, etc., i was at first skeptical.  I suffered the brunt of these reissues when i tried to purchase a Metallica album reissued on vinyl.  That album boasted that it was \\"half speed mastered\\" bla bla bla.  It was horrible.  Terrible to listen to.  Totally reinforced my belief that all metallica music should be illegally downloaded.  So this was my fear was.....that this LZ reissue would suffer the same fate....a simple marketing ploy for the artists to make more money while the music is horribly botched.  Fortunately, Metallica is not Led Zeppelin!  Fortunately, i think Jimmy Page has  little more pride than Lars (tool) Ulrich.    Bottom line:  this is a fantastic LP release.  Top to bottom, the music is full, fast, clear, punchy......just great!  Exactly what i was looking for!  I have a great original copy of LZ II.....great for comparison.  Now i don't want to rush to judgement cause i've only had this thing for about an hour, but i'm leaning towards favoring the reissue over the original.  Isn't that the point of these \\"remastered\\" reissues?  Say what you want about the song selections.  Sure, i would have liked to have seen a couple more here and there.  Maybe we'll get lucky and they'll do another reissue in a few years.  Here's hoping.  But for what it is, it can't be any better.    As for the actual box set....very nice.  They dida good job.  Any LZ fan will appreciate it.  Four album covers with band members pics....that actually don't house the records themselves.  Good quality record sleeves included separate for that.  Nice!  Also a booklet with a nice article and song information.  Like i said, good for any fan.  There's a cool review on youtube...a British girl does a video review.  check that out.    Anyway, i hope this helps.  Well done.  Enjoy.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It will pass the time very well for you. I had no problems with any of it.

B004WGGQPQ|1.0|the drawing pad app is a waste of 1.99 I mean you can paint or draw and its not like you can hang it up on the wall if you do something really good you can erase it or save it I mean id rather pay good money and paint something and hang it up so don't waste your money for a app that should be free.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are so many games. I don't think ill ever get bored so fun! its a bit hard to get enough points to get more games but that's still fine.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is fun, has kept me occupied for at least an hour tonight... Simple to learn,.but gets more difficult as you go, so not too easy. Try it, it's worth a  &rdquo;shot&rdquo;

B006GG1KOC|1.0|horrible all u do is press buttons and once you finish you cant do anything else never get this app even if it os the app of the day like I got it
0439023513|2.0|The end of the book was so  rushed I had to re-read is several times to know what was going on.  I felt zero sympathy for the death of certain main characters because they were just rushed.  Ugh... the ending was terrible.  I feel so let down reading this book after the first two were so good.
0399224459|5.0|I love this book.  More importantly, my 2 year old son does too! I have read it too him every night almost since Christmas.  He loves to find the moon and balloon on each page. The black pages are hos favorite and he knows that the bubbles say \\"Night, night\\" as he says. He squeals at the zookeeper's wife when she hears all the nighty,nights.  This book is beautifully illustrated, and I find something new in the drawings a lot.
B005KAH7QU|3.0|The first 2/3 of the movie worked but the whole last ten minutes fell flat.  Spoilers.  Hannah shows no loyalty to anyone. She doesn't try to rescue the family that protected her, leaving them to be (presumably) slaughtered. She doesn't try to save her father. The last was the worst because you could argue that she didn't know what would likely happen to the family. They just have her run away. She doesn't even struggle with the issue on whether to try, unless some anguish on her face while while she's running is supposed to serve that purpose.
0553386794|2.0|Having read the first volume of this series, and now having just finished watching the HBO series, I'll stick to the TV version from now on.  That way I can avoid the tedious writing of this author, but still enjoy his well drawn characters and intriguing plot.<br />My major problems with the writing are the incredible number of characters and the ever so slow pacing of the author's writing.  Keeping large numbers of characters organized in one's mind is hard enough, but when the author gives these multiple characters MULTIPLE NAMES and then refers to them by their different names repeatedly, sometimes on THE SAME PAGE, well, that is frustrating beyond belief.  That author is asking too much of his readers.  For example, there is a character named Lord Petyr (Littlefinger) Baelish.  Sometimes he is called Lord Petyr.  Sometimes he is called Lord Baelish and sometimes he is referred to by his \\"nickname\\", Littlefinger.  And this can all happen on one page! You might think that one person is having a conversation with three different people, but there is only one person in the room with him, he is just being called by different names.  SLOPPY!<br />THen there is the pacing.  I can understand beginning the series with lots of backstory for the characters, after all this is your introduction to them.  But, as the novel progresses and the plot starts to thicken a good author will make sure the plot QUICKENS as well.  When your story is reaching its climax you want things to move fast, yet here we are expected to read MINUTE detail about what this character is wearing. Or we get endless dream sequences to symbolize something --which is fine at the beginning of your story, but the CLIMAX is supposed to be faster.  THink of climax in its sexual context; if you didn't quicken the pace,it would never end.  As an example, in one of the latter chapters in this book, young Bran is brought down to the dungeons where his ancestors are buried.  He then recites the history of all his dead relatives.  Again, this would be something a good author would do at the BEGINNING of a tale, not as the tale is reaching its conclusion! It slows things down and makes for VERY frustrated reading.<br />I will try the second book and see how things go.  But it is easier, I fear, to skip the books and watch the excellent TV show. THe folks in Hollywood know how to fix these things.relatives.  Again, this would be something a good author would do at the BEGINNING of a tale, not as the tale is reaching its conclusion!

B003MC5AV2|1.0|This review is going to be short and not so sweet. I'll be honest: this book is, well, crap. There's no other way to put it. There were a few good points, such as a female character able to be strong and happy without a man. So I guess it deserves a few points for girl power. But other then that, there was nothing to it. NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED. Everything can be summed up in the following-- Girl is wronged by boy. Girl swears off boys, because they are all jerks. Other girls are wronged by guys and join her, forming a club. Some people don't approve of the club. Girls discover not all men are scum of the earth. Girl starts dating her friend's ex. Everyone's happy. Woop-de-doo. That's basically all that happens. The book could be condensed to 50 pages and still tell the same story. It's SO predictable. There's no plot twists at all, and heck, there's barely a plot. Also, it's SO unrealistic. Characters say stuff like \\"what to the evs.\\" (?!?!) Was there even a time when ANYONE EVER said that? And there's no freaking way most of the girls in a high school would swear off guys. EVER. A handful of girls, yes. But dozens and dozens of them? Nope. No way. Penny's parents were barely present in the story, except to say stuff about the Beatles. (?!?!) Not that there's anything wrong with the Beatles, but it's like that's the only thing they ever talked about. I felt like this whole book was mostly \\"blah...blah...\\" filler crap to make the book longer. So basically, what I'm trying to say is that there really isn't any substance to story, making it a waste of your time, since there's barely a story there to read. I also read another book of this author: Prom and Prejudice. I wasn't too impressed with that book, either. It was better than The Lonely Hearts Club, sure, but not really worth reading. So, I'm most likely going to be steering clear of this author from now on. I found this book neither inspiring nor enjoyable nor well-writen. Seriously, don't waste you're money on this.
0525423656|4.0|Cassia Reyes is a sweet girl. She does as she is told and has never questioned the Society before. That's about to change.<br /><br />In the Society the officials make the decisions for you. Who you will marry, what your career will be, and even when you will die. Cassia is matched with her childhood friend Xavier in the first book, Matched, but her plans change when she finds out that her real match is to Ky, someone she knows but has never thought of that way. After spending time with him, though, Cassia falls in love with Ky, to Xavier's dismay.<br /><br />Ky is not allowed to be with Cassia because his father committed a crime, which makes Ky an Aberration. To remove Ky from the picture, the Society takes him to be killed in a so-called humane way: in battle, along with other Aberrations and Anomalies (the people who committed crimes,) given guns that have no ammo in them and sent to defend the borderlands from the Enemy.<br /><br />Ky and two of his new friends escape and they run for the mountains. Ky plans to go back for Cassia once he can figure a way back to the Society. But Cassia isn't waiting around to be rescued; she has run away to find Ky by enlisting herself in a labor camp nearby were the rumored battlefields are. On the way, she hears rumors about an organization called the Rising that is said to be consisted of people who survive by without the Society and are trying to take down the Society. Will Ky and Cassia ever find each other again? And if they do, will they be able to survive or find the Rising?<br /><br />In book one, Cassia begins to realize how much better life would be without the Society. Now, in book two, she begins to act and break free. This is displayed perfectly on the covers of the books. The society is the bubble. Cassia begins to break out of it in the second book, but in the first she is trapped. This book is packed with adventure and romance.<br /><br />Like many popular love triangle books (read Twilight,) the Matched trilogy takes readers on a ride through self discovery and through decisions that will shape all involved. Unlike some books (Twilight, again,) the heroine is not a wimpy whiner who sits around for seasons at a time frozen, unable to act until her love comes back for her. Cassia becomes a well rounded character through the first two books as she starts to act on her own outside the commands of the Society.<br /><br />The series borrows heavily from 1984, which is a good thing as every generation needs the message wrapped in generational language. Unlike 1984, love is the focus here and fans of science fiction may find it slow going at times. In fact, the biggest concern about the third book is how Ally Condie will finish the series in only one book. In Crossed, very little time passes from start to finish and most of the time is spent in one location. Some will be disappointed with the quick finish to the book, when the Rising finally comes into play only to have the story end on a cliffhanger.<br /><br />My twelve year old daughter, probably at the low end of the intended age market said, \\"I absolutely loved this book and the descriptions were terrific. I can not wait to read the next one and find out what happens next. The complex story structure insures that the reader never becomes bored. There is always something happening and some sort of looming terror nearby. The entire time I was reading the book I was filled with apprehension and suspense. I recommend this book for Middle Schoolers and up.\\"<br /><br />My conclusion: I found a complex science fiction world reminiscent of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451 with a love story good enough to keep young readers interested. Overall, a very good series so far and I am looking forward to the conclusion.<br /><br />This book was provided by the publisher as a review copy.

Sometimes it's hard to include the younger kids in games, not this one!  Strategy + Fast rounds = FUN!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|We gave one each to 2 families with kids ages 10-16 for Christmas. The 14 year old boys liked it the best, but the whole family tried it and like it. It doesn't feel durable, but they haven't broken it yet in the past month. If you like mechanical puzzles, you'll like this.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I bought the CD \\"Clear as Day\\" by Scotty McCreery for my girlfriend for Christmas.  She absolutely loves all of the songs.  We've had fun listening to it and relating it to our relationship.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I have this on my phone but the fire version has twice locked up and I had to wait until the battery ran down to get out of the program.  Hats off to lazy stupid programmers who ignore input from the User in a program.
B000W9DSVW|1.0|I ordered the Blu Ray Ocean's Trilogy, and it is horrible quality. It looks like it is a pirated version, which is too bad because I gave it to my husband for Christmas- and it was disappointing.
B001HN690O|5.0|I mentioned in my Kung Fu Panda review I was very leery at first about watching animated movies, but that and Shrek changed my opinion.  Kung Fu Panda 2 is also a great mix of action, comedy, and a great message about being yourself and even helps introduce the concept of life and death in a non-graphic way.  I highly recommend it.
145551389X|5.0|I bought this book for my daugther; I was surprised when I saw it!. In addition of being a big book, the quality of the pictures and the paper is great
B004KV92ZE|5.0|I was very leery at first about watching another animated movie, thinking it would be boring for the adults in the room. But Kung Fu Panda is a very well written story with lots of action, comedy, and a good moral about being yourself, so I have no problem watching this with my 3.5 year old.  Which is a good thing because he wants to watch it over and over again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games. A lot of variety. You have to play all the games to earn points in order to play other games.
B000W9399S|5.0|A great fantasy read that will get you started in a series of satire fantasy you can read any time. It is part of the series of Discworld novels but is so fun to read it does not seem like a commitment to read them like other fantasy series seem to become.
B0064X79JC|4.0|I never heard of this book until I saw the film.  I could be taking away from the book by discussing the film but the film brought me to the book.  I believe they are great complements.  It is interesting seeing how two different forms of media can make something their own.  The book does a great job of providing a history of the driver, giving back story the film lacked. As short as this book was, it provided rich characters.  After finishing the book I just wanted more to read. I plan to get more of James Sallis' work on my reading list.  I'm looking forward to the sequel of this book which comes out in April.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|this game is easy and intuitive. good time killer. gets harder as you go on and ability to level up features.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is amazing! Did you know that you can change your candy to a cupcake or a donnut by tapping it at the main screen?
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|I liked it very much.  Life is like this.  I thought the end was perfect.  To come to grips with the celebration of who someone was that you loved so much is how best to truly mourn them properly.  I thought the father's advise to just go on living as if the loved one is still with you was best advice.
145551389X|3.0|This photo journal was a bit of a dissapointment. The book is well produced, and is comprised totally of photographs, but a large proportion of the shots are candid type photos taken on tour and featuring Lady Gaga in situ. I had hoped to see more high quality photographs of Lady Gaga posing in her costumes. I wanted to look at her costumes, shoes, accessories, hair and make-up but unfortunately the photos of Lady Gaga in her costumes were often of poor resolution and quality so that much of the detailing was lost.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found his game challenging yet relaxing at the same time.  The music was a relaxing plus for me too.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this game only about 4 days ago and LOVE IT!  you people need to suck it up with all this freezing buisness./
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Gameplay is enjoyable and the upgrade system is a nice addition to the traditional missile defence style game. Only gets 4 star though because of middling graphics that could be better. Works well on the Fire.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love me some angry birds boyyyy its so awesomeful and I recommend it to people who like fun if u don't get this app then u hate fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|Downloaded the Weather Channel app when I first got my Kindle Fire and found it to be very limited. AccuWeather is great with quick access to current weather, five day forecast, realtime radar and weather alerts all for free.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|amazing,  I started with the free version of this game.  it was good,but I quickly decided that for 1.49 the paid version is super.  so many sounds to choose from and I love how sounds can be layered.  for years I have slept rarely more than a few hours at a time. I often wake 3-4 times in a night, but I set this app playing for a hour,  I was out in no time.  I did wake up about 6 hours later but that was due to sunlight.  so I say how wonderful.  maybe just coincidence, but the sounds are so relaxing. well worth it anyway.  I figure that sound machines can be pricey so, amazon could have easily charged more.
0385535139|3.0|I was not impressed by Litigators. It seemed to really lack the plot and the punch line at the end. Also, the happy end was a little too happy for my taste. Overall, a very average lawyer novel by John Grisham. On the flip side, the book is super easy to follow.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Addicted to the Vampire Diaries and the second season didn't disappoint.  Received this item quicker than expected.  Spent a lot less money for this on Amazon than local retailers.
B000002UTT|2.0|Two reasons why I ordered this CD from Amazon: I couldn't find it anywhere else & I was told it would ship fast. Ha! I ordered it on Dec 5, 2011 and my email that confirmed it shipped said I should expect it on Dec 10. Never came. In fact, it never came until Dec 22, a full 2 1/2 weeks after I ordered it, and a week after the Christmas party I wanted to give it at. The CD works great but I was definitely disapointed in the shipping. Going to do a little more research before ordering from this website again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is easy to use and works smoothly. It's challenging and fun, with a variety of options to make games easier or more complex.  Highly recommended.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|You can plug the enclosed USB cable into a Mac, download Audacity for free, and start recording. Unfortunately, the sound level is a bit low, i.e., you'll have to crank it up in the software which may enhance noise issues, and the software is a bit daunting to the newcomer.  Alternatively (and much better) you can set the built-in preamplifier to Line and connect the RCA cable to the Mac's Line-In. In this case you can use System Preferences/Sound/Input and set the input level to about 50% to match the device. All this takes is a RCA female to 3.5mm stereo adapter which, e.g., Amazon is happy to sell. The RCA cable attached to the unit is a bit short so you might want to invest in a RCA male to female extension cable as well.  Given these the unit works well although the construction is a bit on the plastic side.  The enclosed software is not specific to the unit and requires Windows. You could run it in a virtual box on the Mac but either Audacity or VinylStudio are much better alternatives for the Mac itself. Specifically the latter has a nice interface for all the standard functions to convert vinyl, e.g., track splitting, filtering, database lookup of track names, collection management, CD burning for CD or MP3 players, and communication to iTunes; all at a cost of about $30 and try before you buy.
0545128285|5.0|WE BUY THIS BOOK ONE YEAR A GO AND MY DOUGHTER READ IN ONE DAY SHE LOVE THIS KIND OF BOOKS, I RECOMMEND FOR YOUR FAMILY.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game only gives you 10 games initially....a little misleading.  The points system is very confusing to me.  I am still trying to figure it out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game for when I'm really bored, makes the time go by. my only problem is that some of the games have weird controls, I would like it better if they. fixed that problem,  but other than that. its good
1451648537|3.0|Lots of details and information good to know....Jobs life shows anybody can make it or do it being crazy and intelligent  same time more to go i am not finished.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The classic style has a polished and contemporary feel that allows for hours of enjoyable game play. The game can get somewhat repetitive at times but there's still enough variation with level ups and the like. A must try.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very good I beloved many people will find thatt this game is right for them because of the variety
1416955070|5.0|I love this series and highly recommend reading these books... I myself can't wait for book 5 to come out!  Then when I found out they were being made into movies I got sooo excited, until I realized who they cast for Jace!  Slight spoiler alert... Jace is supposed to be this kick butt awesome guy, and they cast the SUPER GIRLY Jamie Campbell Bower.  SO DISAPPOINTED!  They've completely ruined what would've been amazing movies.  Should've cast someone more manly like hottie Alex Pettyfer from I Am Number Four.  He looks the part of Jace and is what I imagined while reading the books.  So sad.  Maybe Cassandra Clare imagined someone more girly for Jace, but it sure doesn't seem that way when reading the books.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a ok app with all the random games. But what makes this app not good is that you have to unlock all the games, (the makers probably just wanted you to keep playing it) and I though that you can just see all the games on it but whatever. If you think you just get 101 games before getting this its not gonna happen so don't get it.
B003L77G10|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Julianna Marguiles is outstanding, and the writing is smart, engaging, and suspenseful. And what can you say to describe the character of Kalinda? She alone makes this show worth watching. I highly recommend not just this season but season one and the current season 3 on CBS!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have enjoyed playing the games in the game pack. A nice variety. I also like theidea of earningpoints to get more games.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I now prefer this app over the Weather Channel's which doesn't seem to have a radar map for the Kindle Fire like it does on my iPhone.
B005LAIGLO|3.0|Glum Mark Wahlberg sleepwalks through this role as he has in most of his other movies.  He is a retired smuggler of counterfeit money and other contraband (he don't do drugs!)  Now with a beautiful wife (Kate Beckinsale) and a couple of young children, he has his own security installation business.  When his brother-in-law gets in trouble with a mobster (a very effective and slimy Giovanni Ribisi) for losing a cocaine heist, Chris (Wahlberg) agrees to another run, coming out of retirement.  Surprisingly, all his enablers and companions are still in place from New Orleans to Panama.  This is one of those heist movies we've seen dozens of times.  You find yourself pulling for the success of the crime even knowing...well, it's a crime.  But of course, there is a noble cause.<br /><br />As in typical heist films, the plans are terribly complicated and convoluted, yet are created on short notice.  Also every detail must be pulled off without a hitch.  Timing must be perfect.  Yada, yada, yada.  Here's the kicker.  I got caught up in the intricacy and action sequences.  There are explosions and gunfights of course, but they don't overwhelm the film ala, Michael Bay.  If you are worn out from all of the award-worth films of November, December and early January, let this showy film cleanse your movie-watching palate.  You won't remember it in a few months but it's fun while it lasts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is pretty fun. I really liked all the different game choices you are offered. fun fun fun fun fun fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really. lots of really fun games to play and easy to get points hours and hours and minutes of fun games
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Just got old realy fast, fun classic game but no new twists or gimmicks to give it staying power, glad it was free
1439190275|5.0|Roberts Atkins tended to a great polarizer: either you regarded him as God's gift to dieting or he was a medical Satan destined to convert people into human beach balls filled with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obviously the reality is more nuanced and somewhere in between. These 3 authors have produced one of the most comprehensive discussion on low carb eating that is not only scientifically and medically sound, but also easily understandable by the lay public. Not only are the authors acknowledged experts in this field, they are also responsible for a considerable fraction of the peer reviewed literature supporting their interpretations.  During Atkins' time, low carb eating meant a largely meat, cheese, and heavy cream selection with little else which was primarily viewed by the medical establishment as food choices worthy of exorcism. Since Atkins' time, there have been three significant developments that impact the low carb field that the authors discuss which greatly impacts how a low carb diet can be implemented: 1) understanding the role of fiber, both as a healthy addition to a diet as well as it's effect on \\"net\\" carb intake; 2) the concept of the glycemic index which basically says that not all carbs are created equal with regard to their impact on insulin (which is now recognized as the real culprit in the maladies of modern life); and 3) recognition that all fats are not created equal and that fat composition (quality), rather than quantity is more critical to disease predisposition.   With all these evolving concepts in mind, the authors present an updated and fresh presentation of low carb eating that is less focused merely on entering ketosis (which seemed to fascinate Atkins) and emphasizes dietary alterations that will not only produce weight loss, but also improve overall nutrition and positively impact risk factors for the majority of diseases modern society is struggling with. Of particular note, the authors progress from initial weightloss through to a maintenance diet plan. As a result, the current implementation of a low carb diet is much more varied with an emphasis on inclusion of all the things that are regarded as healthy (fruits and vegetables, but only certain types and not necessarily the most popular).  As usual, there is the compulsory recipe section, but also included are recommendations for fast food restaurants as well as dining choices. Perhaps the only negative aspect (that may dissuade some people from this diet) is the emphasis on \\"counting\\" carb grams. Depending on how much strict adherence is required (an individual feature, unfortunately), some people may find the rigor too demanding.
B004G600A4|4.0|This is a great movie.  The kids and I enjoyed watching it together.  Great addition to our collection.  Can't wait to see the new Tangled Ever After that comes to the theaters soon.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my Mom for Christmas as she wasn't able to get out to see it. I had previously purchased the book to read before she saw the movie. I urge you to read the book before seeing the movie. Both are great, but the book goes deeper into detail that the movie doesn't. If you aren't a reader, then you will still thoroughly enjoy this movie!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I travel a lot and used to have to buy then abandon a fan everywhere I went. now I save a load of cash and sleep like a baby! you can set the number of hours, and unlike sound machines Sleepy time will run for the entire night!!!!!
B006SV2LWA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have seen several virus movies, and have been disappointed in them all. They are never realistic, and usually have long shot, unbelievable characters who survive against all odds, or get sick and are cured in the nick of time, or who have heroes who are never effect and main characters who never get sick. Not this movie. I found the scenario realistic, the characters believable, no one was perfect, even the good guys. There are several big name actors, and not all of them are safe, or squeaky clean.  I watched this movie because it came highly recommended by some medical professional family members. I was skeptical because of all the negative reviews saying it was boring and unrealistic and depressing. I found this movie was absolutely none of these things. I will say if you require a movie to be shoot-em-up robots or man eating aliens every five seconds to be enjoyable, this is not your movie. If you require squeaky clean heroes and a 100% happy ending where no one dies, this is not for you. If you like realistic true to life what if movies that make you think, this is definitely one that did that for me.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game to play it works well on my kindle fire, like misspent command from the atari 2600 days
B0043UCWA4|5.0|This is one of the most interesting series that I never thought I would watch. It has a true core story of honor, love, truth, and passion. Yes it has it's gore and hardcore moments but if realistic like events of this time bothers you then don't watch it. But I rather enjoy Spartacus in his continued quest for freedom and honoring his wifes death. The only thing that these episodes get that is a bit much is the slow mo CGI events in the arena. Still the background music score and crisp HD color is artistically and heart-pounding awesome! I should mention that both my wife and myself are hooked on SPARTACUS!
B0063IH60K|5.0|you could spend hours enjoying this game I love it and encourage everyone to try it. you will not be dissapointed.
B004UID2LC|1.0|!!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!$$$$$THIS APP HAS BAD LANGUGE IN THE TITLES DO NOT LET KIDS GET A HOLD OF THIS !!!! BAD APP!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|i like it and i am 11 when i read this in 2011 i kove it my new favorit book can not wait for the next one and i read it it is really good. not as bad as harry potter.
0439023483|4.0|As one reviewer put it, \\"You've got to hand it to Collins: No one can plot a fantasy novel like her. Nobody... She creates believable, likable and riveting characters, ridiculously addictive survival scenarios and a rich world to boot. If you aren't up until 4 a.m. finishing this thing, you're a corpse.\\"<br /><br />The premise for the series is familiar to those of us who watched grainy, black and white, sci-fi TV when we were kids: Think Spartacus meets Rollerball meets The Lottery. In a grim, futuristic world, children are randomly chosen, a boy and a girl from each district, to compete in games to the death.<br /><br />Collins tells a great story, without getting bogged down in the pathos of the situation. This leads many edge-of-their seat readers to second guess themselves, and to think, \\"Hey, wait a minute.\\" about the basic concept. Truth is, the Hunger Games is a story (well, the trilogy is actually 3 stories). A fictitious story. If you were able to suspend reality long enough to finish the book(s), then you cant cry Foul after the score has been counted.
0525478817|4.0|Bought this book for my daughter for Christmas because she raved about John Green and was thrilled that all pre-orders came signed. She has read everything that he has written so far and is a big fan because he is one of the founders of the \\"Nerdfighters\\", check them out!
B006C1DH92|5.0|Really love the new challenge mode they introduced. You also unlock challenges but as far as I can tell there is no way to see how you unlocked them. It's a fun game none the less.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app! use it all the time on my kindle fire and doesn't freeze or crash! great for typing long stories or papers!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Game is fun and a good time waster. Gets pretty difficult the further you go. Didn't have any problems so far and really enjoyed it.
B005HSL626|5.0|its... its... its... BEAUTIFUL!!!!! must i say more? &bull;.&deg; &hellip; great app i love trying to unlock blades and backgrounds and ITS FREE!!!
0307949486|5.0|Awesome book! A great mystery novel that really keeps you guessing to the very end. A lot of redeeming qualities about this book though I wish it was translated from Swedish to American English instead of UK English and the sub-plot didn't add much to the main plot but it was still a great read!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|Nice Features. All works well so far: Heart rate, GPS/tracks. The Garmin connect feature is very informative, plus it interfaces with RunKeeper. Unit itself is a little bulky, but the wrist band works wel.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|you run out of points quick and have to keep playing the same games over and over to move forward.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Really enjoy how quickly I can look up a word.  I use this frequently. With this app I am more likely to look up the meaning other than guessing.  Now I even have it on my iPhone too!
0062073486|5.0|You know the feeling, right before the last term of the school year ends you receive (sometimes as an email, sometimes in snail mail) the summer reading list. And boy, is it long. Looking back on the past years, you dread even looking for the books on your list in fear of how thick or how old they are going to be. However, when you do go on your quest to find these inevitably boring works of fiction, you stumble upon \\"And Then There Were None\\" by Agatha Christie. Intrigued by the description on the back, you begin to read the first page. And then the second. and then the third. Until, before you know it, you have finished the book in just a matter of hours. This has never happened before and you're pleasantly surprised at the fact that you finished a summer reading book without being bored to tears.<br /><br />This was exactly how I came into contact with this book, and I have to say, it is by far one of the best books I have ever read. Being intrigued by the murder and mystery that this book and many others like it has to offer, I was captivated by every page. If you're looking for a murder mystery that keeps your heart beating, palms sweating, throat gulping throughout the entire story, this book is for you. Agatha Christie's story includes very unique characters and a very original story line that will keep you guessing with every turn.
1603425381|5.0|Wonderful book, great ideas, pictures are very helpful, designs are inspiring.  I loved the information on how to make the border fit my designs, especially around corners.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|I have had a few seiko watches in my time so I trusted the company. I received the watch and I loved the look of the watch. I found out after I received the watch that it is not made in japan but Malaysia. The watch lost 2 1/2 min a day so you have to constantly reset it. After 2 weeks of this I returned the watch. They should state that it is built in Malaysia.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that you can earn points to buy other games. A lot of different variety. After you try a game 5 times you get 1,000 points.
0060873027|4.0|Allegedly, when Michael Chrichton passed away, he has completed approximately one-third of what has become \\"Micro\\", as well as notes and files. The estate retained Richard Preston to complete \\"Micro\\". The outcome is a pretty good techno-thriller, but is definitely not a Michael Chrichton work.<br /><br /> Like most of Chrichton's work, \\"Micro\\" wants to blend contemporary events and science with more than a dash of scientific fantasy to produce an unexpected - and terrifying - outcome, such as the dinosaurs in \\"Jurassic Park\\".<br /><br /> In \\"Micro\\", seven graduate science students at Harvard are courted by a glad-handing entrepreneur, Vin Drake, to come interview for jobs with Nanigen MicroTechnologies. The need for them is immediate and the seven are expected to put their studies aside to visit Nanigen in Hawaii and tour their facilities.<br /><br /> Eric Jansen, the brother of Peter, one of the students, is a Vice President at Nanigen. Peter receives a mysterious text message from Eric, saying only \\"don't come\\". Peter has also just received word that his brother Eric is missing and presumed dead after a boating accident.<br /><br /> Peter is suspicious, but doesn't convey his suspicions to the others or the police. The police are occupied in a mild way with what they presume are the suicides of three men who are found slashed to death.<br /><br /> The story moves quickly to the point where we learn that Nanigen shrinks people and things to microscopic size and sends them into the rain forest to search out new ingredients for drugs and other commercial uses.<br /><br /> Vin Drake, it turns out, is not a nice person - the seven students are soon shrunk to a half-inch high and set loose in the rain forest where they are expected to die within a few days.<br /><br /> I won't go into more detail in order to avoid spoilers. The book stands on its own, just don't expect it to read like Michael Chrichton.<br /><br /> The plot has lots of holes and depends on science, real and imaginary, to keep the reader interested. Character development is weak. The storyline becomes increasingly forced as the novel heads toward a conclusion.<br /><br /> I think the Chrichton estate has made an error here and diluted the reputation of Michael Chrichton. This doesn't have the feel of a Chrichton novel. It appears this posthumous effort was intended to exploit the Chrichton name for money. It would never sell as well under the solo name of Richard Preston.<br /><br />  It isn't an awful book by any stretch. It simply isn't what it pretends to be, a Michael Chrichton novel.<br /><br />Jerryk. The storyline becomes increasingly forced as the novel heads toward a conclusion.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|the game will have you in your seat for quite a while. a perfect mix of old school arcade fun and strategy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|these bad reviews confuse me because I dont think the adds are even that bad, and the minigames are fun.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Played well on my Droid 2 which has the Gingerbread OS but freezes up on my Asus Transformer Prime tablet which has the Ice Cream OS.  If I could play it on my tablet, I would give it 5 stars.
B000002HEM|4.0|Very short review because it's more of a question - WHY WHY WHY did they exclude \\"Let the Mystery Be\\" from this CD??  I was never a big fan of 10,000 Maniacs until I saw this MTV Unplugged show, and I was blown away by the music and Natalie Merchant's voice.  Though many - most, really - of the songs are quite dark, they are so well done.  Haunting, as several people have said - they've stayed with me for years, and Natalie's duo with David Byrne of Iris Dement's \\"Let the Mystery Be\\" was the highlight for me.  It was so much better than any other version I've ever heard (sorry Iris...).  I bought the CD and was SO disappointed to find that track missing, and I've spent a long time searching for an audio or video version with no success.  Used to be available on youtube but it's gone now.  I understand copyrights, but WHY is there no official released version?
B000MV9026|1.0|I am wondering if this is  pirated DVD as it skips and there are delays when it plays. The movie is great but the quality of the DVD is poor.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Enjoyable iteration of the classic missile defense category of game. Game play is smooth (on Samsung Galaxy Nexus w/ 4.0.2) and controls are intuitive. Didn't have to stare at the screen at any point and ask what the point of something was...
B0059XTUB8|5.0|I went in to this movie not knowing what to expect. I did find that it was an amazing movie that I think would be hard to fill the shoes of Marilyn Monroe in the first place but I think Williams did an amazing job and her voice and her physical appearance just made it so much more real. Seeing this movie made me want to know more information on Marilyn Monroe and I have more respect for Michelle Williams because of her strong role in this great film!
0060873027|3.0|I have ready every Michael Crichton book and was so sad about his passing.  Favorite Richard Preston novel is Cobra Event which I found both terrifying and plausible.  I was so excited to hear that Richard Preston had picked up the Micro mantle, but overall this was a plodding and predictable read.  And, not enough scientific explanation w/r/t the \\"shrinking\\" technology.  Suspend ALL reality at the door as there isn't even the smallest of explanation about how the shrinking can work on animate and inanimate alike.  RIP Michael Crichton.  Richard Preston write more like Cobra Event!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not the best app I have, but not the worst either. Some of the games are nicely challenging, but others are nearly impossible to complete.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun to waste time but controls aren't the best on some of the games .. other than that if u are bored it def works
B005KJZDXK|5.0|M. ward is a musical genius, Zooey deschannel has the classical undertone that makes She & Him one of the true music duo's of the more recent years. As in the past artists getting big feel compelled to put out a christmas album, this either goes well or incredibly bad. She & Him is one band who i will say nailed their christmas album, little saint nick was incredible. Cool Translucent red LP, great buy keep on rockin She & him.
B0058VW36U|4.0|loved it.  it kept me so occupied. I. love it on my kindle fire and on my ipad 2 I especially love how you can change the candy
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is very fun the amounts. of points are reasonable but high.  I love this game

B004J4WKTW|4.0|I first heard of [[ASIN:0385534639 The Night Circus]] because Erin Morgenstern had previously participated in November's National Novel Writing Month, and she wrote a pep-talk to participants this year mentioning that this novel came out of work she'd done during intense Novembers past. I have small quibbles with some repetitive adjectives and other ways in which her writing could be sharper, but have no complaints about her concepts.<br /><br />Celia and Marco, students and competitors and exhibitors and bewildered participants of magic, use the circus as a forum for a challenge they were entered into as children, without their consent. The ways in which they are bound to the challenge and to each other, and to the circus, is fascinating. But the greatest achievement of this book, I think, is that they are only the central part of this complete world of fascinating white-and-black tents, filled with and surrounded by an equally interesting cast of characters. The story jumps around in time quite a bit and could confuse readers who take lengthy breaks during the reading, but it continues to move forward, even as we see new people pulled into the spell of the circus and the magic of believing in magic.<br /><br />The novel is a romance, but it is also a rumination on the nature of time, of willful ignorance and curiosity, and the fact that no matter what we might construct to be black and white, the world is full of shades of grey (and, luckily, red scarves as well). I especially enjoyed how visual and, yes, magical the story is, without needing to create a new vocabulary (like, say, [[ASIN:059035342X Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Book 1)]]) nor being too academic and wry (as is [[ASIN:0765356155 Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell: A Novel]]).<br /><br />Again, there are times that I wish the writing itself was tighter and her vocab and sentence structure more varied, especially as the story ramps up to its satisfying resolution. Mostly, though, it makes me look forward to Morgenstern's next work, and what new type of magical world she'll create.xt work, and what new type of magical world she'll create.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is the best version of Emma to date.  Well cast, well written, and well acted.  The age disparity is not creepy in this version.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|The main reason I watched this movie was because Aaron Paul was in it. If you dont know, Paul is the co-star of what is undeniabley the best tv show in the history of television. However he was completely under-utilized in this film. It seemed he really only had a few lines and a little expansion on his character, simply for an opportunity for him to act, could have added a lot to the movie. The second reason I watched this film was because I am a fan of the original, which I watched after Quentin Tarantino listed it in his top 20 grindhouse films list. If you are a Tarantino fan you know that the bulk of Tarantino films are homages to 70s grindhouse films and it is cool to watch the movies that influenced him. The original wont let you down in this area. My problem with the remake was that it left out all of the scenes that made the original a good film. The most recognizable being that the remake contained no chainsaw, easily the most memorable part of the original. Instead we get a scene with a microwave, which was decent, but I couldnt help feeling completely let down by the fact that there was NO chainsaw anywhere. Also, in the remake, Krugers son does not die. I kept waiting for him to blow his own brains out and it never happened. FAIL!!! That was the most interesting scene of the original by far. Also missing was the absurd comedy provided by the police officers, who in the original hitched a ride on in the back of a truck transporting chickens. There was no comedic relief at all in this one. So basically every aspect of the orginal that made it unique was removed. Instead you have an average horror movie that doesnt really provide anything that makes it worth stomaching the rape scene.
B005WFWVL4|5.0|I was looking forward to seeing this film simply based on the director, Steven Soderbergh. I waited till its Blu-ray release and blind bought the film. I was hesitant due to the mixed reviews, however I was astounded by the perfectly flawless video and audio quality of the Blu-ray, and the well crafted story which quite quick and raw unfolds in Contagion. There is not a huge amount of character development as the movie jumps right into the horror of a virus which starts dropping people like flies in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining and brings up a lot of personal questions. What would you do? How would you act? Would you have done this or that? I love movies like this which are not only meant to entertain, but also to educate and possibly prepare you for a similar situation. I never really doubted the film. I think a lot of people didn't believe it, especially how the government would react. I for one must state that this is how the people and how the government would react to such a threat to America as well as the rest of the world. It is very interesting how it spreads and don't worry, throughout the film you will pick up more bits of information regarding how this all started. You must watch this until the very end. Don't get bored and turn it off as you are greatly missing the message and story of this scary tale.<br /><br />The Blu-ray PQ and AQ are amazing and up there with some of the best I have ever seen.<br /><br />A highly recommended terror film that even with its quick character development will be remembered and watched again.
0691152640|5.0|This Time Is Different is an excellent study of financial booms and busts by two highly regarded economists. Although events like the Great Recession and Great Depression in the U. S. are far apart they do have characteristics in common. Reinhart and Rogoff exam eight centuries of financial folly. All financial market participants should read this book!
B004IZMQI2|5.0|I heard the title of this book being thrown around on a webinar with a few popular bloggers.<br /><br />Then I saw it on a few sites here and there.<br /><br />I decided to purchase the eBook version for Kindle -- which opened up a whole new experience for reading on a laptop. The app is much better than I imagined.<br /><br />With that being said, this book was just incredible insightful, compelling, motivating, inspiring, and injected me with a incredible amount of confidence. This is something I always thought of, realized it was there, but could never put a word to it besides Fear.<br /><br />The book goes into the artist's creativity, tapping into one's self to unleash their true calling, their passion, their purpose for being on this planet. The Resistance, which has no shape or form, attacks and pokes at various times at our life, especially when we are believing to do what we are supposed to. It fill us with doubt, fear, and anxiety. How we overcome that defines our character.<br /><br />This is a book that must be read by all walks of life -- not just writers. Although it nicely correlates with the writing craft, I truly believe that this fundamental thought lies within all of us.<br /><br />This is a book of power. Knowledge. Insight. Inspiration. And sometimes, that's all we need.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game ...makes you think but not too much. good exercise for the noggin and can't wait to play reflect sequel.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Meh. it is an ok app. lots of content but the games are rather simple. some are more fun than others.
B0013FFMOK|4.0|When I first watched this movie, it nearly scared the crap out of me. This movie is not for young children and faint of heart people. This movie is VERY intese and there is a lot of pop-up scares.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I had a hard time to lay this book down and went through it in two days! It is such a sweet story which even gave me butterflies while reading it :)
B000000H64|5.0|Demanufacture is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. It's hard to find words to describe just how epic this album is but I shall give it a try. I'll start by saying that when judging Fear Factory albums, for me, the tipping point between a good Fear Factory album and a bad one is Burton C. Bell(The band's lead singer). See, the thing is, the rest of band always brings it's A-game on every album... However, Mr. Bell is hit and miss with me. Don't get me wrong, love the guy, but I do think he either saves or damns an album. The one exception I have to that rule is Soul of a New Machine, their one album I consider Death Metal. Burton has a death growl in that album that didn't really fit him, but Soul of the New Machine was still exciting because of the fresh overall sound it presented. Demanufacture was their next album and Bell decided to tone his voice down to something slightly less extreme than his previous death growl. He went with something similar to the bark that Pantera's Phil Anselmo was adopting at roughly the same time... And it's the perfect sound for them. After Demanufacture, he added even more melody into his vocals, which I didn't like because I thought his vocals were so perfect on Demanufacture. I've gotten used to the melody but I still think that this is Bell in top form. So that's the easiest way of me separating this album from the rest of the pack. There are other things I'd like to mention as well, though... This album plays directly to my psyche by adding all sorts of great industrial elements that just remind me of watching the Terminator flicks as a youth... There's even a sound-byte from Terminator 2 on the track Piss-Christ. Also, the song variety is stunning. We get some great melodic sections on the second track, Self Bias Resistor(By the way, Burton C. Bell invented the heavy-to-clean vocal style, not Robert Flynn of Machine Head, great as he may be... And even Robert Flynn would tell you this). Then we get a remake of Dog Day Sunrise, which almost sounds like a great grunge rock song... Think Alice in Chains. The final track on the album is a big, long, nine minute epic that sounds subdued when compared to the rest of the tracks... But Fear Factory manages to pull this off with out losing track of what they are... A kick ass industrial metal band. Demanfacture is Fear Factory's best album and should be in any self-respecting metal head's collection. If you haven't heard it yet, you are missing out on a masterpiece.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app it fun to play and doesn't get old til you get all.the games but it takes a while.
0060775858|5.0|My children enjoyed this book as children.  My mother bought it for them.  She buys this for all the grandchildren and great granchildren.  At 88 she is the one that asked me to get her this book to give to her latest great grandson.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great.  Does the job. No real bells and whistles. I would like for it to be on the screen rather than having to call up an app but it's still fine.
B000FGFUMM|5.0|I will try to make this as short as possible.  I've never been a huge Megadeth fan, as a matter of fact I've called them Megacrap for a long time. I never thought they were crappy really, but I just always viewed them as second tier Metallica.  I've always been an audiophile, and just recently I've finally gotten the means to begin buying \\"decent\\" equipment and looking for good media to play. I've been buying up every SACD that I could find at a reasonable price, and since my musical tastes vary so much I've had no problem finding and buying a ton of jazz SACDs (although I am a metal head, I did go see the Big 4 last summer, though I missed Megadeth's set and only made it to Slayer and Metallica), and of course a few rock SACDs (mainly Pink Floyd). When I read about the reputation Mobile Fidelity had with remastering music, not only did I pick Santana's Caravanserai and Love, Devotion, Surrender SACDs, but I went ahead and took a chance on MoFi's Santana I and Abraxas Gold CD releases. The Santana Gold CDs were the best versions of those albums I've heard (I owned the 97 remasters that featured those 3-4 extra live tracks at the end of the CD), convinced by MoFi's reputation and my experiance with the Santana Gold CDs, I figured some of the other Gold CDs would be worth a shot.  If you like metal or very heavy rock AND are an audiophile, then you know how RARE metal albums are on SACD or ever DVD-A format. So although I was not a huge Megadeth fan, I did like \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" a lot, and I remember that other tracks on Countdown to Extinction were all right. So when I came across MoFi's Gold CD of Countdown To Extinction for a very fair price, I said \\"why not? MoFi did a great job with remastering Santana albums on the Gold CD, maybe this release is worth a listen!\\"   My friend and I always talk about hi-def recordings and always say the CD can at best be as good as its source, and I always joked that if the source is Dave Mustaine then no matter the format,it would always sound bad! So the CD arrived yesterday and I did not bother to listen to it myself, I just grabbed it and my brand new Sennheiser HD650s and took it my friends house (who is a much bigger metalhead and actually likes Megadeth alot). I hooked up my Senns up to his system and put in the CD and gave it a first listen, and I immediately skipped to \\"Symphony\\" and within 10 second I was in total awe! I could not believe how AWESOME this CD sounds! I also brought over CD and SACD verisons of other albums to do some comparisons between formats on my Senns, and while I was certainly blown away by the difference in quality between SACD and CD versions of the same album, I was still in TOTAL AWE of how great this CD sounded.  When I got home, I played my lossless version of \\"Symphony\\" immediately followed by the MoFi version and could not believe the difference in quality! Not even the difference between my Albert King/SRV In Session CD and SACD sounded this pronounced! The difference between the original \\"Countdown\\" and the MoFi version, CD to CD, is simply out of this world! Today I really cranked up my Sennheiser HD 650s and played MoFi's \\"Countdown\\" from beginning to end, I could not stop listening to every single song, they all sounded to good! Even though I always joked (in good fun) about Megadeth, this was no joking matter, I felt like I completely ignored a truly awesome album for the past several years. This is truly a spectacular job done by MoFi.  Lets be clear, the \\"gold\\" in the MoFi Gold series does nothing for the actual sound. This is still a CD, and the CD format has a maximum sample rate rate of 44.1 Khz and 16-bit quantization, regardless of the material. This is a digital format, the laser can only read 0's and 1's, so no CD format, regardless of material, can have higher resolution. If you want a higer resolution format, you have go SACD or DVD-A, period. The gold MAY prevent oxidation, may be more durable than the typical aluminum and thus a Gold CD may last longer than a standard CD, but there is nothing about the gold that will make the CD sound better. What the gold certainly does do is make for a STUNNING LOOKING cd and a wonderful marketing angle. This does not mean that the sound quality of an album can't be improved in the CD format, of course it can, or else I wouldn't be writing such a positive review of this release. The REAL gold of MoFi's Gold CD releases is the MASTERING! MoFi knows what they are doing when it comes to remastering music. Its their quality remastering job that makes their releases so good! Its what makes the Gold \\"Countdown\\" sound so much better than the standard CD release; MoFi did such a good job, that it nearly reaches SACD/DVD-A levels of quality, such a good job that I can no longer make jokes about Megadeth!
B005UPOAT2|3.0|The transfer used for the Blu Ray is rather poor and, by the looks of it, old. No detail, no sharpness, no proper film look. Marginally better than a good DVD, but that is not good enough for HD on Blu Ray. At least it's cheap as it should be when a studio recycles old masters like this.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hi, I found The Hunger Games on the internet. Free download available here: [...]  It's compatible with Amazon Kindle. I checked it,   and in my case - it works normally.
B005KJZDW6|4.0|I was already a fan of She & Him prior to purchasing this. I'd call the tracks a mixed bag, but overall, a pleasant listen. I usually listen to your standard, traditional Christmas albums like Bing Crosby. The vinyl is a translucent red, which is quite fun. It also came with a code for digital downloads of the tracks - another win. I can't say it's the best album I've purchased recently, but I don't regret it.

0439023521|5.0|This book was absolutly amazing. I'm 13 and couldn't have picked a better book. it was just enough violence, romance, and action. Peeta was absolutely amazing and i don't think a person like him ever will exist because no one is perfect (except Peeta).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I first wanted to read this book (and its sequels) because of the subject matter...hunger games.  I was curious to see how they would turn out.    This was such a good, fast, interesting read.  I am not embarrassed to admit I am over 60 and this book is grouped with the children's and young adult books but the three-book series was very well written and entertaining.  The only difference between these books and \\"Adult\\" books was the omission of sex and cuss words...and they were not missed at all.  In fact, it was a refreshing change to read these three books--which includes Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  Another appealing aspect of these books is that they are written in the first-person, which I prefer because then I know the character is alive at the end.  I highly recommend...and am anticipating seeing the movies.

B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is one of the greatest movies for children.  The story, the music and lessons learned are worth repeating.  There are some parts of the movie that might be scary for very young children.  The first time this movie is watched with young children, it's a good idea for an adult to watch it with them in order to answer any questions that might come up.  My grandsons loved the movie, but had many questions about death and Scar at the end.  Even so, I highly recommend it.
B005XQLBU4|2.0|When you reach the higher levels, the game begins to make your missiles explode far off target and the game becomes unplayable.

B005F6NA56|4.0|Music critics unfortunately miss out on some solid albums released throughout the year.  Feist's [[ASIN:B005OUARUO Metals]] is one of those albums from a personal standpoint. With so many captivating efforts to cover, for whatever reason, Feist missed `the list.' It should NOT have by any means, considering how consistent, enjoyable, and well conceived it is as a whole.  The songwriting is strong, incredibly moody at times, while the production is always alluring and captivating.  While Metals may not quite compare to the `superhuman' strength of Florence + The Machine's exceptional sophomore set Ceremonials, it is pretty darn close.<br /><br />The album opens on the strength of \\"The Bad in Each Other,\\" which starts with nice thudding drums to open the cut. The folksy nature of the cut is unique and is capped off by understated vocals by Feist.  Feist's vocal tone is nice and clearly executed here.  The use of horns and strings on the refrain is a superb change of pace and timbre from the folksy rumination of the verses. \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" sets the overall tone and mood of Metals. \\"Graveyard\\" picks up where \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" left off.  Feist's vocals has a distinct presence within the production work, contrasting the timbre and mix of the preceding cut.  The acoustic piano is a nice touch, sporadically played and mixed to the left within the mix.  The change of pace with lush instrumentation following the second iteration of the refrain is a superb touch, yielding sort of an instrumental bridge. \\"Graveyard\\" turns out to be another gem.<br /><br />\\"Caught a Long Wind\\" possesses a nice understated sound with Feist's vocals never rising to a `boil.' The use of upright bass, acoustic guitar (panned right), acoustic piano (panned left) and strings is smart and beautiful in orchestration.  As far as the excitability, \\"Caught a Long Wind\\" falls short of the augustness of either \\"The Bad in Each Other\\" or \\"Graveyard,\\" but still proves to be a solid listen.  If nothing else, the intensification of the percussive aspect of the cut is a plus, noted by claps on beats two and four towards the end of the cut.  \\"How Come You Never Go There\\" opens with nicely harmonized vocals singing on neutral syllables.  The pop-soul vibe contrasts the pop-folk feel of the previous cut, which is smart.  Vocally, Feist's vocals are nonchalant, but pleasant, exerting only slight burst of belting and spirit.  The feistiness of this cut helps to sell it more than \\"Caught a Long Wind.\\"<br /><br />\\"A Commotion\\" is completely different than previous cuts and valedictory.  The busy rhythmic vibe helps to propel the cut forward while Feist's vocal lines still possess a chill, relaxed feel.  Eventually, the agitated rhythms combust into the dynamic spoken word \\"The Commotion!\\" which is both alluring and shocking.  Speaking of alluring, the use of horns on the spirited refrain only add to the the delightful, yet agitated timbre.  \\"A Commotion\\" is nothing short of brilliant. While \\"A Circle Married the Line\\" follows stiff competition, it holds its own. Feist explores her upper register delivering accurate, clear vocals.  The harmonic progression that underlies the cut is brilliant.  The musical ideas here are superb too; there are nice traces of rhythmic (stressed) and unstressed components, much like say a poem.  \\"Bittersweet Melodies\\" opens mysteriously, with Feist's vocals likened to a cooing bird.  The songwriting is solid, though at times the cut itself feels a bit too understated.  Regardless, Feist commits little crime on any cut from Metals.<br /><br />\\"Anti-Pioneer\\" is another virtuous cut, noted for Feist's chilly, enthralling vocals.  Organ is subtly mixed here to provide the cut with a more organic sound.  Strings are added to enhance the timbre nearing the 4:00 mark.  What makes \\"Anti-Pioneer\\" so interesting is that Feist oscillates between minimalist to maximalist vibes; the cut percolates from the minimal to the maximal and then simmers backdown.  Excellence is exemplified. \\"Undiscovered First\\" is even more captivating, noted by it understated four-on-the-floor thud to open the cut.  Electric guitar enters in with the minimalist thud, seemingly off from the rhythm established by the aforementioned rhythm (purposely).  Feist enters, in full-on minimalist mode, with only her voice.  Suddenly, the refrain yields more dynamic sound with tambourine and drum thuds squarely in tempo. By the 3:40 mark, the cut erupts into something gargantuan and different from everything else.  \\"Undiscovered First\\" is one of those `undiscovered' gems of 2011 that should last into 2012 and beyond!<br /><br />\\"Cicadas and Gulls\\" has a fine folk-pop feel, but the static nature of the cut makes it too predictable to be as cutting edge as its predecessors.  \\"Comfort Me\\" is perfect atonement, with clear, decipherable lead vocals by Feist.  The highlight of \\"Comfort Me\\" are the stomping drums and dynamic sound that pervade the cut after the 2:00 mark (in a positive fashion of course).  \\"Get It Wrong Get It Right\\" closes the album, but is less revolutionary or noteworthy than the best cuts.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B005OUARUO Metals]] is a well conceived and well produced effort.  Feist shows and delivers the upmost musicianship on this highly underrated 2011 effort.  Metals is easily one of the top releases of the year, no questions asked.ndiscovered First\\" is even more captivating, noted by it understated four-on-the-floor thud to open the cut.

B004XWMXX8|5.0|Okay, I was a bit skeptical about some of the music because it seemed ripped off of other tracks but changed up a little.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the lyrics and some of the songs.  This is a great, positive, wonderful CD that sends great messages and always puts me in a better mood when I listen to it. I could not recommend more! If you like trippy, eclectic music that makes you happy then you will probably like this CD.
B006INDTAQ|4.0|This is a fun movie to watch when your brain needs some downtime. Good actors and visuals with lots of action. It uses the standard Western motif (a mysterious stranger appears in a dusty run-down town) with a twist. Guess it won't be a spoiler by saying that it has some vicious aliens with buggy flying machines. After I watched the download version, I bought the Blu-ray. Good fun!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|great fun and a good time consumer this was a good buy all around.. mind bottling.. definetly need more like this one..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very cool! their are tons of great games. their are only a couple of hard games that I cant get past
B00005ATZT|4.0|Every time I'm in a Ross Store I like to go to the ultra-bargain DVD rack and see what I can find. It's fun! I know, I can afford the regular price but when I can pick up \\"The Fugitive\\" DVD for under four bills, it just makes the viewing all that more pleasurable. OK. I'm a bit eccentric, but one has to have some method of choosing movies to watch late at night.<br /><br />\\"The Fugitive\\" stars Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones in an action-packed chase movie. It begins with Ford (playing a prominent surgeon) having his beautiful and loving wife murdered and with him getting the blame, found guilty and imprisoned. Then, while he's getting transported from one site to another, he's inadvertently involved in a train wreck and freed. Enter Jones, a super-cop from the U.S. Marshall's office, and the  chase is on. Will Ford, the chasee, escape and be able to simultaneously solve the mystery of his wife's death and invalidate his prison sentence? Or will Jones. the chaser, and his super-efficient team catch the fugitive? Well, the chaser is amazingly close to the chasee throughout the remaining 3/4 of the movie until all is finally resolved at the end. It's a fun movie to watch. Lot's of spectacular action. Good visuals and interesting characters.<br /><br />The cops (ie., federal marshals) are just incredibly efficient, so efficient that it defies credibility. Well, it's just a movie, but if cops were this good almost all of us would be in jail. I know, I know, I can suspend belief in some movies but I had trouble with the federal police in this case. Funny, sometimes things will win me over and I won't even notice the discrepancies. In this film, I noticed and it distracted from the story. In any case, the film was a good value and I'll probably watch it again sometime in the future.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  I watch it each year around Christmas.  Must see Movie!!!  This is a great family movie, great entertainment.  Even tho this movie is black/white I still enjoy the message.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the games because they are really fun games if I could play them all the time I would. I won't do Kt all the time because I still have to do my homework.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|good fun. great update on a classic title. my kids even love the game. I wonder what the world wide leader's score is.
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Wow.  I laughed/smiled through about most of the album even wondering if Lou was able to keep a straight face when he sang/spoke the lines \\"Spermless Like a Girl\\". This album takes Berlin and Metal Machine Music to the next dimension. It definitely takes a few listenings to arrive in this new dimension. Only Lou could put out this type of an album.  I am also sure Lou is getting a big kick out of the over the top negative reaction of the Metallica fans.  The death threats from Metallica fans adds to the excitment and fits in well with the album. The response of the Metellic fans is similar to the folkies who cried and mourned when Dylan went electic.  As we know in 20 years from now this album will be considered a lost rock classic with cover bands playing it from beginning to end and threater productions in the East Village. Apparently as Lou approaches 70 years old in a few months he wants to continue to leave his mark with lyrics that burn into your brain...the ultimate rock and roll f... you.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a really good game for wasting time. A little bit of getting used to required. Fun to play while waiting on buses.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|cant even get it fully downloaded to playon my amazon kindle,its very frusterating i cant even play or take the game off its stuck on 78% has been all day.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|The story line is good, I really don't care for all the nudity and the sex but the story is good enough to look over that.  Defintly not for childern.

B004O5N3VA|5.0|This is the album that everyone was talking about in the year 2011!  This album features, in fact, the biggest hits of 2011. Includes \\"Hold It Against Me\\" - #1, \\"Till The World Ends\\" - #3, \\"I Wanna Go\\" - #7, & \\"Criminal\\" - #55, all on the Billboard Hot 100.  Buy it! All of the songs are amazing!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I found some of the games rather pointless. but isn't that the point of tablet games?  It wasted my time just fineq
B002NXSRVG|1.0|The biggest problem with this movie is its disregard with the fact that GIJOE is supposed to be fiercely American, thus the phrase \\"a real American Hero.\\"  This movie makes them out to be some sort of United Nations group.  I don't recall seeing one American flag in the movie, now granted I didn't pay too much attention after the first 20 minutes revealed the angle they were taking. The characters are all a bunch of paper-thin talking-head blow-hards with extremely bad dialogue.  I have been waiting for a live action GIJOE since I was 10 years old.  Alas, upon seeing the ads for this movie I knew then that I would have to wait another 10-15 years for Hollywood to re-load the franchise because this one was a blank.
B000P0J024|2.0|For anyone who has never heard the original recording this may be the way to go.  If you have the original, as I do, this recording sounds very thin in comparison.  It is bad enough that I contacted Rhino.  They were nice enough to send replacements but those sounded just as bad.  I absolutely love these albums and it is a shame that this recording is so bad.  If you want the albums look into buying used versions of the originals.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|smooth gameplay for kindle fire! upgrades makes any game that much better! its easy for most players because the concept of missle command is the same as its always been.
B00003CXCD|4.0|I knew this was an old movie, story very simple as was in those days.  I thought it was colorized by looking at the packaging and it wasn't, which was a bit disappointing, but it was enjoyable.
B004LWZW4M|2.0|I've been watching the original Planet of the Apes movies lately, and after you get past the cheesy datedness and Heston's atrocious acting there is actually a huge amount of social commentary in them- everything from critiques of bellicosity, militarism, totalitarianism, racism, and the human tendency to subjugate others.  Fictional parallels to real world situations of police states, internment camps, segregation, and military aggression run throughout.  Compare that to the thematically bland \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" that was still advertised as \\"a cautionary tale\\" even though it had little to no social commentary. The apes in the modern version were made intelligent by an engineered virus, because even Evolution is too prickly of a subject for the summer blockbuster crowd. And rather than widespread institutionalized subjugation, the apes break out of one particular facility where they are mistreated by a few people. The implied downfall of the human race in this new version was also attributed to the experimental virus that goes awry, rather than the intentional use of nuclear weapons. The titular planet in this case is more of a \\"woopsie!\\" than a direct result of humankind's poor decisions or flawed nature.    Yeah the effects were good, and there are some surprisingly poignant emotional moments, but any higher theme or message has been purged from the plot.  In conclusion, movies today are WEAK, and all of these \\"remakes\\" and \\"reboots\\" diminish the original films rather than making them relevant again.
0143039431|5.0|It arrived in new condition.  There was nothing written in it and the cover was not bent of wrinkled.  We were happy.
0312641893|4.0|As a prolific reader of Cinderella retellings in particular as well as fairy tale retellings in general, I knew this was a book I had to give a try. In my opinion, the Cinderella elements seemed a bit shoehorned in, perhaps as a gimmick for readers. The strengths were definitely in different areas in my opinion.<br /><br />One of those areas would be love interest Prince Kai, soon to be emperor of the Commonwealth where the story takes place. Lately I've found myself super frustrated with YA love interests and that didn't really happen here. Instead I saw a young man bravely facing his responsibilities and the pressures of external threats and a devastating plague.<br /><br />Another strength was the villainess, the terrifying Queen Levana of the Lunar, a people who live on the moon who is intent on marrying Prince Kai in order to take over his kingdom and subdue the entire planet under her rule. She has already murdered her family including the real heir to the throne, her niece, and controls everything with her bioelectrical powers (basically magic to you and me). She has a willing army, probably unleashed the plague on the population, seems to hold all of the cards and to be at least a step ahead of everyone else-that's scary!<br /><br />Now I didn't not like Cinder but I didn't love her as much as I loved the other two characters I mentioned. In fact I ended up liking her nice stepsister Peony and her android assistant Iko more-both seem very young and sprightly. Meanwhile Cinder is a cyborg orphan who was briefly the ward of a man and is now the loathed ward of his wife. She is also a mechanical genius and like many Cinderella retellings, she meets the prince before the ball allowing them some time to get to know each other instead of falling in love at first sight. I wasn't very convinced by the attraction he does claim to feel but I still like them as individual entities.<br /><br />But I didn't think much of its fidelity to the original story (Grimm, Perrault, or Disney) for two big reasons. The first is the threat of the Lunar Queen, an understandable change as she is very compelling and threatening as well as a good addition to create enough conflict to sustain a multi-part story. But I don't remember any external threats in the Cinderella stories; the evil person should be the stepmother.  The other reason was that Cinder has no memories of a life before being with the stepmother; in the Grimm version, she remembers and honors her mother which leads to her attendance at the ball. Here at least it seems like she may eventually be able to access memories.<br /><br />A few last notes: there is a bit of mystery around Cinder's origins but I found it fairly obvious (as have other reviewers). I found the world building to be average; it's supposed to be set in New Beijing, which I assumed would mean a very Chinese environment but it seemed pretty American to me.<br /><br />Overall: Fairy tale retelling seems to have been a hook to garner an audience when it's action and futuristic setting should have been plenty.irst is the threat of the Lunar Queen, an understandable change as she is very compelling and threatening as well as a good addition to create enough conflict to sustain a multi-part story.

B002NHIK1E|4.0|Let's me be honest here... I watched this series initially because of the fact there's some MAJOR eye candy. Yes, when it comes to Ian Somerhalder, I am amazingly shallow.<br />That said... I tried reading the book series by the same name years earlier and I wasn't really into it so I cannot comment on the transition from book to TV show. I will say however that these actors and actresses can act. In addition, the plot is very interesting to me (a 30-something year old woman), even if it's geared toward a younger audience.<br />If you enjoy shows like Supernatural, I think you'll like Vampire Diaries.
B0012HQKZE|4.0|Anthony Hopkins plays a tremedous role in this movie. His character is one that we can all learn from. His employee, played by Alec Baldwin had an ongoing affair with his wife and intended to kill Hopkins charatcer after the plane crashes in the wilderness. Hopkins saves this mans life twice during the movie, once during a bear attack, and then again after Bob (played by Baldwin) falls into a bear trap, after having learned about the affair by seeing the inscription that was on the invoice for Bob's and his watch, which was given to him on his birthday. His words at the end when asked what happened to his friends, \\"They died saving my life.\\" He still had forgiveness in his heart towards Bob.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Just what I was looking for. I also bought the suggested cable. I have a sony wireless head set and this works great.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Plays well. Intuitive controls. Good looking and fun, but a little too easy. Got to level 20 on the first try...
B0063IH60K|4.0|plain old solitaire good as ever. nothing fancy. could use a score tracker but other than that its good.yup, simple
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Combines skill and a bit of strategy for a solid old-school game revival.  Good graphics and sound, too.  Hard to put down.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Solid game. I like the ability to earn points that can ber used to repair cities &amp; upgrade the defense capabilities.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|Saw this film in the movie theater recently and I was pleasantly surprised by Gary Oldman's performance as Smiley. A number of other actors also did a great job, including John Hurt as control. The sets and effort put into re-producing the cold war era was also also very satisfying.  It may also have been easier to find good Russian actors for the more recent series.  However, I must say that the cast overall didn't manage, in my opinion, to equal the quality of the TV series. This was particularly true of the four \\"suspects\\", especially Toby Esterhase and Percy Adeline. Part of the problem was the acting but part of the problem was the script which, in any event, did not manage to develop these characters. With so much effort/time into Smiley/Control/Peter/Ricky/Irena, and only 2 hours available, there wasn't much time left to develop the four characters who are suspected of being the \\"mole\\". Where the six-hour TV series has plenty of time to give the viewer time to think about (and care!) who the mole is, this movie just jumps to the conclusion too quickly. Moreover, few people will take the six hours in one sitting...watching the old series one hour a night gives you a whole week to think about who the mole is!  Given that both are based on the same story and \\"give away\\" who the mole is, I would suggest that people look into renting the classic TV series first.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Got this for an anniversary gift for my husband on our 38th anniversary.  We had been on a cruise this past summer and enjoyed entertainment by \\"OH What A Night,\\"  a group which performed Frankie Valli songs.  The funny thing was, my husband ordered the same for me!!  So now we have a CD for the car and for home.  We love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games. love the simplicity of it all. children and adults alike can enjoy the playability. don't do the update if u don't want to lose points.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so great! it is so smart that you need points to unlock new games! I love all the games and I am trying to unlock all of them!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game helps you vent by hitting bombs with your bombs,  saving the city. I like trying to get all the upgrades for my missiles. By helping you vent you are happier and won't toss your aneroid device at a wall.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game if you have time to kill.the games are pretty short and they're pretty different from each other.like mini arcade games
B004EPYZPS|3.0|If you just like special effects and little else you may enjoy this hodgepodge of a film. I remember Spielberg reminiscing on a TCM special about \\"Epic Films\\", how he was influenced as a kid by Cecil B. DeMille's train wreck sequence in the film, \\"The Greatest Show On Earth\\". It's redone  here and it's even more spectacular, but it would have benefited greatly if there had been some suspense leading up to it! After that scene, the film deteriorates into every mediocre Sci-Fi film of the Fifties, except with much bigger special effects. The ending is much like \\"E.T.\\" and \\"Close Encounters Of The Third Kind\\", but without any of the charm of those films, or really making much sense! In fact the whole film borrows heavily on the \\"E.T.\\" theme of the misunderstood, but in this case, brutally tortured alien, just wanting to go home. The ending, despite all of the visual effects, is actually a little cheesy, although we're supposed to feel awe inspired.<br />The whole movie is disjointed and it really pains me to write such a bad review for any film that Spielberg is associated with, but the film leaves the viewer with way too many unanswered questions, and it's really a huge letdown in almost every department! I actually found myself \\"redirecting\\" and \\"rewriting\\" this movie in my head as I was watching it, and that's NOT a good sign!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the way this game plays.  I wish the face of the card showed the actual number rather than a single large picture of each suit.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love the progression of the game, that there's actually something to work towards. the games aren't too repetitive either and its re addicting c:
B0059XTTW8|5.0|I've long been a fan of John Le Carre's novel \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and the BBC miniseries that starred Alec Guinness as George Smiley.  The novel is very dense and I wasn't sure a two hour theatrical film could do the work justice.  It does but there is so much great character and story elements that had to be jettisoned I still wonder if a moviegoer who hasn't read the book will be able to keep up.  I'm fairly certain the patient and astute filmgoer will be able to, others may have a hard time of it.<br /><br />TTSS is not a film for the ADD set. If you feel you have to continually text or talk during a film then you should stick to something within your comfort zone because this movie will plow right over your short attention span. TTSS is a film about spies in the '70's Cold War but isn't REALLY about spies, it's about betrayal, political and personal disillusionment and whether or not there is a clear separation between right and wrong. It depicts a morally bleak landscape populated by gray little men and women who work in a field that has an inherent moral rot to it to begin with. It's a slow and deliberately paced film that demands you pay attention to it. I know this doesn't sound like a positive critique but TTSS really is a film worth seeing. It's a rich film with many layers to it and you will probably see something new in it with repeated viewings.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it it has so many games and rewards. I like how you have to have a certain amount of points to unlock one game but some of them are really challenging
0307959856|3.0|...that Austen observed the world with sense, sensibility and perhaps most engagingly, a sense of humor.  This novel is dull, plodding and very repetitive. Elizabeth, perhaps out of boredom, vacates the story for many chapters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is fun and challenging.  I like the different types of games available.  I would reccommend this app to those who like variety.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app! It's great to have so many versions of the Bible as well as study guides. I've found it to be a great tool.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This version of the old school arcade game is awesome. Game play is smooth. Graphics are ok. Options too rebuild city and upgrade your weapon of defense was a great addition on this old classic. I enjoy playing.  Samsung Galaxy SII.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun like missile command but the upgrades make it way better.  Goes from super easy to devastating.  Would like to see a little more variety besides just upgrades.  New terrains perhaps?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is okay.  it is all a bunch of simple games. it is a good thing to take up time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|not only does it work great and never glitches,  but it also provided you with everything you need to know about the weather!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Very good comedic take on Dracula/vampire saga...period costumes good, although could do without the fake looking show.  You have to feel sorry for Roman considering what happened to him.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I do not under stand why you have you have to be connected to the Internet in order to read the Bible. please fix this.
B000FAGGWQ|5.0|This is by far the best bonus material from any release of Star Wars. I own the blu ray set and there is nothing in there that touches any of the material from this set. The documentary \\"Empire of Dreams\\" is 2 and a half hours long and it is just amazing. This disc is seriously worth $50. This disc plus the 2006 trilogy (with the original versions of the films) is seriously all you need to experience the original trilogy. The blu ray set has great picture and quality, but if you are very against the changes, buy the 2006 trilogy and this. You will be TOTALLY FINE. Just fantastic!!!
B002QW7ALM|2.0|After reading the reviews, I was expecting more.  I was disappointed. Why?  Mad Max like weaponry with agrarian curved blades fashioned from tools we never see? Check.  Industrial like film staging with large riveted girder supports that appear to be completely superfluous? Check.  Impractically large spaces in the middle of a spaceship? Check.  Attractive token female who is a street fighter (and of course a bug eating eco-biologist when she's not kicking behind)? Check.  Spiky haired blood sucking aliens? Check.  Almost impossibly hard to kill? Check.  Daddy alien who gets annoyed? Check.  Walkway (gasp -without handrails) to a big thingy reactor like in Star Wars? Check.  Mediocre acting? Check.  Checklist to show it's an extremely mediocre sci-fi flick? Check.  Sadly, this could have been a great movie -the story behind it is an intriguing one (though personally the alien like figures didn't need to be there, the enemy could have been within).  However, for me, there are too many \\"checklist cheapshots\\" that really spoilt the movie for me.  From unbelievable aliens to the spaceship (and sadly not believable in a bad way) I felt opportunities were missed to really make it an engrossing great sci-fi movie.  The characters never really became either loathsome or sympathetic -resulting in a general apathy towards them.  So 2 stars -yes, I've seen worse, and in all truthfulness none of any of the facets of this movie were truly badly done, but all of them were mediocre -conspiring to create a thoroughly below average movie.  I did catch myself pressing the fast forward button towards the end; that says everything.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|I tried to judge this movie by the director's intent: to make a gory, low-budget drive-in style movie. But drive-in movies are fun because they generally aren't political, they're escapism. This movie is a political piece of white-hating garbage. Every white character is a violent oppressor; every hispanic character is a helpless victim.    I have no idea why DeNiro would attach himself to this slanderous project, nor Jessica Alba. Lohan probably took what she could get. One tries to be open-minded about the theme, but having DeNiro's character shoot down a pregnant illegal like he's poaching a buck can only be viewed as white hating. The ultimate conclusion is tragically clear: this director is an anti-white bigot. The movie is a disgrace. Save your money, save your time.

B005FI6IRG|5.0|Philippe Jaroussky's voice must surely be one of the most well-known in the world today, with a delicate timbre that puts one in mind of a fragile, tender morning full of birdsong and finespun sunlight.<br /><br />Teaming up with him on this album is countertenor Max Emanuel Cencic, whose tessitura is a little lower than Jaroussky's, with a sound a little more robust, as though the morning had wandered on apace and the sun had already evaporated the dew upon the green.<br /><br />The result? Wonderful - truly a magical match of voices, with of course the outstanding ensemble Les Arts Florissants conducted with detail and mastery by William Christie.<br /><br />The repertoire (duetti da camera by Bononcini, Mancini, FConti, Porpora, Marcello and Alessandro Scarlatti) allows both voices to exhibit their tone and sensibilities within and upon the music. Moving between solo and duet segments, it's nothing less than delicious pleasure to listen to. Both the tender and the sprightly movements are beautifully performed.<br /><br />The demands of this sort of music reveal just how much technical mastery was required by the castrati of the day, as well as the qualities of emotional and spiritual conveyance from performer to listener.<br /><br />Utterly beautiful. Recommended in the highest degree.

B00005N6KG|3.0|I'm a court reporter and I purchased these headphones because I wanted a pair of lightweight headphones that I could rest on my neck and use in a hurry for bench conferences at trial.   Before these headphones I was just using earbuds, but I didn't like fooling around for an extra ten seconds trying to untangle cords and figuring out which bud goes in which ear.  Every second counts in court reporting!  -- Positives:  They are lightweight and easy to slip on and off my ears quickly.  -- Negatives:  They are not comfortable at all.    They start to hurt after 30 minutes of solid use.  I guess it's lucky for me that bench conferences don't typically last too long.

B006IVBSBU|4.0|For those who like the type of movie (think: Outbreak, I am Legend, The Stand, 28 Days Later, etc.) where the world is essentially taken over by something uncontrollable, this was a great new addition. It doesn't at all have the supernatural/horror aspect to it like I am Legend or 28 Days Later, but I liked it for the same reason I like those -- it makes you think! Simple as that. The cast was good, and the storyline kept me entertained and interested through the very end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun and perfect for a road trip! the games are so fun! GET THIS APP!! btw it runs amazingly on my kindle fire
B0059XTUVI|4.0|It is traditional with reviews about controversial subjects (such as Tony Blair or books by Richard Dawkins) to declare a position so that the reader can make a snap judgment on it if that is their wont. This is precisely the reason I'm not going to. Why? Firstly such things should not be a factor when judging a film and, secondly, if you're less than the age of 40 (as ironically most people who debate the subject are), then your views probably have more to do with where you grew up, rather than firsthand experience.<br /><br />So, what is `The Iron Lady' like? As you may know from other reviews, Meryl Streep's performance is first rate and this is not just hyperbole as most of the post-cinema conversations I heard were of people saying the same thing.<br /><br />There is also credit due to the rest of the cast and the director as almost everything about the film comes off as eerily similar to the real thing (although Denis Thatcher seemed a bit more `wild' in real life than he is portrayed here, and many of the Conservative figures (except Richard E. Grant) are not as identifiable as they should be).<br /><br />The plot too is cleverly worked out, showing Thatcher's political life through the lens of a dementia patient. It struck me that even if all `Margaret Thatcher' had ever done was being a fiercely competitive flower arranger; the portrayal would still have the same - i.e. neutral and mostly fair.<br /><br />And this same strength - a fresh perspective - may also be its greatest weakness. In exploring Lady T's dementia, the politics are rather left aside. You almost feel like you want them to say something to offend you, rather than by mild inference, and the film may be seen as too much of a whitewash of the significant events of her premiership.<br /><br />That said, striking the right balance with films on controversial subjects is always tricky, as inevitably the bias of the director comes through. The fact that Lady Thatcher has refused to see the film may be a sign that the author hasn't pandered to her too much, just as the fact that the film is being boycotted on Tyneside shows that it is clearly too close to the truth for comfort.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, then, a good film, if a little light on politics. Although the film seems to have sparked a revival in Thatcher-bashing, it's good to see that someone has finally taken much of the venom out of the subject and given it a breath of fresh air.y be a sign that the author hasn't pandered to her too much, just as the fact that the film is being boycotted on Tyneside shows that it is clearly too close to the truth for comfort.<br /><br />In my humble opinion, then, a good film, if a little light on politics.

0783222149|5.0|It's funny with some early-mid 90's films - some of them are so good that, even after 5 watches, you will still see them again on TV and watch them all the way through again. Think [[ASIN:B001RIY4WE Terminator 2 [1991]]], [[ASIN:B000NQRE0K Braveheart [1995]]] or [[ASIN:B000WQWPKA Independence Day [1996]]] and you'll probably have had a similar experience.<br /><br />Which is why this film is such a mystery - it is so compellingly brilliant that it's like your eyes have been superglued to the TV screen and yet somehow it has not endured with time.<br /><br />In fairness, there are probably three reasons for it not enduring: 1st its rather unusual subject, 2nd its low budget and 3rd its slightly predictable plot. However, the excellent performances by the entire cast (most of all Meryl Streep, playing a similarly stubborn alpha female charactor to [[ASIN:B0059XTUVI The Iron Lady]]) and also the excellent soundtrack, scenery and direction more than make up for these flaws and leave you wondering why more people don't know about it.<br /><br />Still, sometimes its good to have films you know are good but others don't have a clue about. Just as [[ASIN:B000I186FW V for Vendetta]] will never be quite as popular as [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]], doesn't make any less of a good film, and the same is true of this.<br />So if you've never seen this film, or have been compelled to see it 10 times, do watch it again as it is still every bit as good as its first go and, best of all, it's a secret thrill...
0307595579|5.0|Delivery was very fast considering it was over the Christmas period. Have been listening to this series on audio book and so was really looking forward to getting the hard copy as a boxed set. Love the extra book on Stieg Larsson and read it all in one evening. Great deal as well.

B0002XV30Q|5.0|Say what you will about Saint-Saens's personal life (or his gripes against certain composers). It doesn't affect the fact that he created some wonderful music in his own lifetime. His piano concertos are some of the most beautiful he has ever created. They are filled with lyrical melodies and expressive melodies. I sometimes wonder why they're not as famous as Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, but anyway, Saint-Saens's concertos are marvelous.<br /><br />Jean-Philippe Collard, the pianist, is simply amazing with his attention to detail. He stresses lyricism and gives all five concertos a bit of an ethereal feel. He is especially careful with his choice of tempo. He never misses a step, and his overall playing is extraordinary. Maestro Andre Previn is magnificent with his steady control of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which performs beautifully alongside pianist and conductor. One small flaw: there's a bit of an imbalance between piano and orchestra (piano sounds fairly louder than the orchestra sometimes). But other than that, everyone involved in this 2-CD recording has done Saint-Saens's piano concertos justice.<br /><br />Grade: 9.3 out of 10

B001MEJY8W|5.0|I just finished Martyrs.  Taking the disc out of the DvD player, putting it back in the case and placing it on a shelf with my other DvDs seemed to take longer than it should have.  I was trying to absorb and digest what I had just seen.  Martyrs is not what I had expected.  It was hard to get through, but I am glad that I did.  By the time that I saw the credits roll, it felt like I had been hit with a brick.  I both love and loathe Martyrs.  I am never going to forget it, and I may never be able to watch it again, but it will always remain in my possession.  PoeBoy's review is better than anything that I can compose.  I just wanted to put in my \\"two cents\\" and give Martyrs the five stars that it deserves.

B0054JURZA|1.0|This is a joke, this whole Bon Iver experiment.  Surely this album was funded by a nefarious scientist who is trying to see if there is an inverse relationship between utterly horid music and hype.    That being said, if you actually inexplicably enjoy music with **painful** harmonized falsetto on the verge of instability, if you love Pitchfork so much you want to marry it, if whiny depressing music is just what the evening calls for, or MOST importantly, if you drink PBR, then this album is made for you.    And no, you really don't like Beth Rest, just as you really don't like PBR.

0061537969|5.0|Set in Seattle where it rains a lot, the father/husband/dog owner aspires to be a champion race car driver. He has learned to manuver his race car in the rain, besting those who come from a drier climate. This engaging story is told though the eyes of the family dog.  The story begins when the dog is old, but looking forward to his next life where, according to Mongolian belief, he will return to earth as a human. (He saw this on TV.) He is certain this will happen as he feels even as a dog he has the soul of a human. We see the lives of this family unfold along with the dog's life in flash backs. I was quickly caught up in the story and read it in one day, although I had to stay up long past my bedtime.   Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail

1439102813|5.0|Started the book this morning and read right through until I finished it tonight. Just a great book about how Alzheimer's Disease, especially early on-set, affects everyone in the family.<br /><br />Obviously I loved the book. The only negative thing I could say about it is to agree with someone else who thought the last chapter was not worth while. The book should have ended with the next to the last chapter. The last one sort of stretched it out and added nothing to the book.
B00006I53S|5.0|So I have been saving to get a nicer lens than what I have. I currently have 4, the 18-55mm kit lens being the main one I use because the others are telephoto. It worked okay for a while, then I got this bad boy! From the first day I took it out to now I have been nothing but impressed! It focuses very quick and the pictures are very crisp. I now have this lens and a 50mm 1.8 and this 28-135mm will be the workhorse of my setup.  P.S. I thought I'd miss those 10mm that the 18-55mm had compared to the 28-135mm, but I have yet to even notice it.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|I've gotten to know Adele's music only recently. Mainly because of a few songs that have been playing non-stop on the radio, Apple sampled \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" for the iPhone 4s launch and more importantly that my co-worker sings her songs every day and they got stuck in my head. I figured, why not get to know Adele and her music by watching her live performances. Hence, I bought the Blu-ray. And it was one of the smarter things I have done in my life.<br /><br />Artist-wise, I believe that Adele is a humble and talented person. I love her music and everything about her. You can really relate to her and her songs.<br /><br />As for the concert performance, it was an awesome experience. I enjoyed every second of her performance. I am sort of an audiophile and in my opinion, the audio was clean and video was sharp. We have a pretty good 7.1 setup at home and a large screen to watch it in. The recording was top-notch and I do not regret buying this blu-ray.<br /><br />Keep rockin' Adele!

B00003CXDB|3.0|Just an ok movie. It's kind of interesting, but certainly not a great movie. The acting is good. It exposes an important corrupt element of US financial markets which goes on as we speak and SEC was asleep on the wheel for 8 Bush years (not a single case of naked shorting was prosecuted).

B004EPYZT4|4.0|Most people won't agree with my assessment, but they will likely be people that only know Conan from the movies or possibly the comic books.  I read all the Conan books growing up, and this is the Conan that should have been.  It better captured his personality, as a rogue, that's fair, cunning, and relentless.  It doesn't show him to be \\"nice\\", but not a \\"bully\\".  It makes him interesting and likable, with a little more depth than punching a camel.  Conan wasn't supposed to be HUGE, but large, and athletic looking.  He was supposed to have black hair.  They still didn't give him blue eyes, but it can be forgiven.  The \\"bad guys\\" were quite appropriate for the setting, and fairly well done.  I don't feel that the weapons were grossly over-sized like I saw another reviewer say, but they weren't \\"authentically\\" sized.  This is a fantasy piece- while I suppose they could be more \\"realistic\\", I don't see that as being necessary, when you have necromancers and monsters in the story...  I hope they come out with others, but given the general reception and poor box office numbers, it isn't too likely.

B0064NTZJO|1.0|There must have been two versions of this movie released, those that the five star reviewers saw, and the one star version that I and other one star reviewers saw.  I envy those that had the option of walking out of the theater.  Being on a trans Pacific flight at the time, at 42,000 feet I did not have that option.  Other one star reviewers have already highlighted most of the lowlights of this movie.  I will just add what I would think would be some of the comments from a Tom Leykis review, should he ever switch from talk radio to movie reviwer..........  Number one, guys you never date a single mother, ever.  Number two, you don't date a single mother when you find out she's still married.  Number three, you don't still keep dating her when you find out her husband is in prison and is about to get out.  Number four, when he does get out, you don't go to the welcome home party.  Need I continue?  I just question how hard up Allan Brooks, Bryan Cranston. and Ron Perlman were that they needed to take on these roles.  There should be a zero star option for reviewing stinkers like this.

B005KELQEU|5.0|The Belkin Portfolio Sleeve Case for Kindle Touch was a great buy. I was looking for a nice case for carrying my Kindle Touch around in my bag.  I didn't like the idea of the flip book covers as they don't seem to give enough protection on the sides, especially from water.  It was a perfect fit for the Kindle Touch, with no scratching by the zip.  Like a laptop sleeve, it's not going to protect your Kindle from a big drop but I wanted a sleeve that wouldn't add too much to the overall size so it would still fit in my pocket.  The Belkin Portfolio Sleeve is a nice looking, light case which has kept my Kindle Touch scratch free and dry, I definitely recommend it if this is what you're looking for.

B0067TQQI8|4.0|I got the Galaxy Nexus phone which is a battery hog, mostly because of the screen. I tested the Anker Astro2 (8400mAh) battery in preparation for a trip overseas and found that it will give me about 2.5 charges on the phone before I need to recharge it. It's simple to set up and use. LED lights on the unit let you know how much of a charge is left. Starting with a completely drained phone, the Anker recharged it to 78% in two hours. I also tried using the phone standing up while it was plugged into the Anker and it was doable, just not graceful because the Anker is almost as big as the phone and thicker. You only need one wire to both charge the Anker and to use it to recharge the Galaxy Nexus. The wall plug adaptor for charging the Anker is detached when recharging the phone. I can easily see misplacing it, which is why I give the Anker four stars instead of five.  The reality is that Nexus should solve this obvious issue by installing a more powerful battery from the beginning and not leave it to third party vendors to come up with solutions.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great! It's sooooooo much fun. I play it all the time. Great games to play when you're bored.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|a nice twist to an old classic. I know I'm not very good but I got to night 40 and it was a nice little challenge to get there. Can't really say that I'd play this game for hours on end; it's not very exciting but the developers did a great job and they deserve 5 stars.
B006C45MRE|4.0|At a time when all Hollywood action movies are either sequels or remakes, even an attempt at something slightly new has to be applauded.  It's true that this movie pokes some fun at westerns and science fiction, which is like a stab in the heart for people who take all this very seriously.  But if you pick up from the title that this is a complete fantasy, it's also a lot of fun.  At least I thought so.  There's even a bit of character development with Harrison Ford turning out to not be such a bad guy after all.  My only gripe is that this would seem to appeal to younger viewers as it has less sex than any blockbuster movie I can remember but why is it that sex is so bad while vaporizing dozens of people is fun for the whole family?  I guess I just wanted to see more of the young lady rising from the ceremonial fire.  She says \\"Man, it got so hot in there I had to strip\\" and Harrison Ford rushes over with a blanket and quotes Groucho Marx, \\"I'm protecting your honor, which is more than you ever did!\\".  That would have make it 5 stars.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|Kindle Fire runs a modified Android Gingerbread.  One of the ways the Kindle Fire is different from most Android devices is it does not have the Google Android Marketplace; instead apps must be obtained through Amazon's own app store.  As of this writing, the DropBox app is not available in the Amazon App Store, but I was able to get it installed on my Kindle Fire anyway with the following steps:<br /> 'Click the gear icon in the top-right corner of the Kindle Fire home screen to activate the Settings window<br /> 'Click More<br /> 'Scroll down to Device<br /> 'Scroll down to `Allow Installation of Applications from Unknown Sources' and move the slider from `Off' to `On<br /> 'You'll be prompted to confirm you mean to do this; you agreee<br /> 'Switch to the Kindle web browser and go to [...], and click Download App.  This will download the Dropbox .apk file<br /> 'When the download is finished you'll see a notification in the top left corner.

1594202842|3.0|Full disclosure: As an Asian-American myself with Tiger parents (albeit less harsh and demanding as Amy Chua, I could certainly relate to many of the themes casted throughout the book: desires to succeed, put 110% in what you do, and of course, having to learn the piano! As a recent college graduate myself, I owe my work ethic to my parents, so I partially agree with the message presented by Amy Chua.  To all the critics of this book, the book is meant to be a satire of 'Chinese parenting', and in interviews Ms. Chua makes this very clear. Don't take the text's words too literally. While it may appear that Ms. Chua has created soul-less, unhappy robot daughters, one should check out her eldest daughter's blog, who appears to be a well-adjusted, intelligent and funny college freshman at Harvard (and pretty attractive too, I must say). Furthermore, the book is not a parenting guide or backlash against Western parenting. In the end, Chua admits to some of her flaws and (gasp!) relents in letting her youngest daughter quit violin and play tennis.   I will agree that some of Ms. Chua's language appears harsh, and many may claim borderline child abuse (eg. forcing to burn her daughter's stuffed animals), but one cannot argue or criticize her dedication and commitment to her children's success. Personally, I think that parents across the US should become more involved in their children's lives, checking and reinforcing their homework, along with encouraging them in their extracurricular activities (Note: I disagree with Ms. Chua's opinion toward school plays and sports, they are a valuable part of childhood and can instill a sense of confidence when presenting oneself in front of others, along with discipline which are useful in any career. I personally was reluctant to participate in a grade school play and in some sports, but now I realize the value in this.) Perhaps US schools would be producing more high-achieving, intelligent students, being able to compete with others, with some extra parental involvement.  While the book was meant to highlight differences in parenting between Asian vs. Western parents, I'm surprised very few reviewers mentioned about relating to the struggles and typical teenage bickering/rebellion that are present, particularly in the second half of the book. By the end of the book, Chua goes into excessive detail about the war between herself and her youngest daughter over continuing violin lessons, and the reader finds himself in the middle between this personal family drama. This is especially evident in the final chapters in the text.   Overall, 'Battle Hymn' is an entertaining, insightful and witty view of Amy Chua's parenting methods and reflections. Anyone who criticizes the authors needs to recognize this first.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.I appreciated it even more after seeing the behind scenes of the movie. Serkis was amazing.......
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Set in a futuristic China, Cinder is a retelling of the Cinderella fairytale.  The concept of retelling or updating the fairytales we grew up on is not a new one.  However, Cinder is one of the more original versions to come along in a while.  The main character, Linh Cinder, is a cyborg mechanic in a futuristic Beijing where cyborgs are definitely second class citizens.  There is no real need to give a lengthy synopsis of the story, more because of its popularity already, not necessarily because of the familiarity of the subject.  Suffice it to say, all the expected elements are there - the wicked stepmother, the step-sisters, the handsome prince, the ball etc.  Those are the background upon which Meyer builds her fantastical storyline, with a conspiracy that adds much to the drama of the story.  Cinder was categorically the best character in the book.  From the very first scene where we meet her taking off her too small mechanical foot while waiting for a more fitting replacement to arrive, to the end where she begins to understand her potential and to come into her own abilities, she is a character who you absolutely want to root for.  Her reactions to her situation are realistic and understandable, and thus very believable.  The stepmother and stepsisters, especially Peony, are wonderful and Iko, Cinder's android companion was endlessly fun and very delightful.  Some of the other characters are not as well drawn as Cinder, and their motivations are not quite as easy to buy into.  My biggest difficulties were with Prince Kai, who seems a bit of a carbon-copy Prince Charming.  He is the perfect reluctant future emperor, doubting his ability to take the place of his larger than life father.  However, the developing love story between Kai and Cinder was very interesting.  It was more because of how Cinder behaved than anything Kai did or didn't do, though.  Then there is Dr. Erland, to whom several major plot points are connected.  He is a difficult character to understand because he doesn't fall easily into the \\"good\\" or \\"evil\\" categories.  While this is actually preferable in a character, so that they are not cardboard, the drawing of him felt a little weak, as it was hard to get a handle on some of his motivations or actions.  Hopefully, this was only necessary so as not to give away his role in the future books.   The conspiracy surrounding the Lunars, and its relationship to Cinder was fairly obvious as well.  It didn't quite fall flat, but was much too easy to figure out.  Some of Queen Levana's actions were not quite believable either.  If the Lunars have as much power as they appear to do, it was hard to understand why they hadn't taken any more decisive action than they had done.  Still, despite those issues, Cinder was a fascinating, entertaining read.  The story is solid and the cliffhanger ending was, although sudden, necessary to set up for the sequel.  If you appreciate a story driven tale, with a solidly drawn, sympathetic main character, and a healthy appreciation for a futuristic story, this book is definitely worth your attention.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|really addicting everyone should give it a try. works great on my kindle fire. I'm giving this a five because I don't get addicted to these games easily
B004XQO90E|5.0|Solid characters, believable story line. (I don't care if the science is 100% accurate or absolutely plausible) - this film rocks, what a great ride. (pun intended)  The actors did a great job - infusing heart and soul into a tense, tight, escapist, thriller. I don't buy many DVDs these days - there are so many other options. Bu when I do add to my \\"analog\\" collection, my main criteria is multiple viewings.   I watched this movie at least 3 times when it first came out. I am amped to see it again. Great job Duncan, Jake, Vera, etc!
B003H90ENE|5.0|RECEIVED IN GREAT CONDITION.  VERY EASY TO INSTALL.  WORKS BEAUTIFULLY.  MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING IT FROM AN OFFICE SUPPLY STORE!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Basically a good game. Graphics aren't too bad. Controls are fine though some game controls are a littler harder than others. There are some challenging hard to beat games. I like it and play often.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Especially the mini games further in that are harder to unlock. Definitely get this game.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|So here I am, in bed with the wife, the dog, a big screen tv, and my 7 inch android tablet (yeah, it's a bit crowded in here). My wife wants to watch the Miss America show (bleh). I'll just throw on my headphones and fire up the, \\"Splashtop\\"! Enjoy the pageant, Honey. I'm streaming a movie from the computer.
1440503257|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3IGH8A0WSJNHC]]This was a gift to a friend who is obviously a POTTER fan, but I'm not sure exactly how much she liked.  As far as the product itself, it seems like a pretty good product.  It has a wide variety of recipes, sure to find many that would indulge any POTTER fan.  The parchment style of the book is also a cool look.  I took away one star because the book lacks any visuals or really any color at all.  It is a pretty recent gift, so no recipes have been tackled yet, but I'll be sure to post an update when they are.   -Thanks  kingkhan13
B004ZNACA6|4.0|This Pink fLoyd Discovery box Set is great, before this the only pink floyd i owned was dark side of the moon, and the wall, the discovery box set, is \\"Designed to introduce people to pink floyd\\" this is why there is less art in some of the pakcets, like the wall, but I also think the remasterngs, stand out in certain albums, like dark side of the moon, the main thing that stuck out to me, was it was just a little bt louder, not al that great, BUT everything BEFORE the dark side album, was remastered great, especially ummagumma! but i noticed some albumd like the wall, has a very SLIGHT increase in volume and defintion, wish you were here, couldve done so much better, when it came to the remastering. i mean it sounded almost exactly like the original, which disappointed me. The main reason i got this, was just because i was going to set out on collecting all the pink floyd albums, (yes i was going to buy dark side, and the wall again, despite already having those two) and now its all in one box set, I got his for christmas, so i was ecstatic, i really wanted to tke care of these, because the albums are packaged individually inside the box, so i cut the plastic right down the middle, slipped the album in and out once i was starting/done with it. I wish there was more added extras rather than just a 60 page booklet, that isnt all that great, but now i have all the pink floyd cds, i was saving up for the, oh by the way box set, but i got this for christmas, so i think i am just gonna buy, meddle, dark side to the division bell again, and not even open those, this just really depends on your situation, if you have the money, and youre a dedicated floyd fan, then you will buy this, if you want all the pink floyd cds, then you will buy this, if you already have all the pink floyd cds, then dont buy this, like it says its designed for people who want to \\"discover pink floyd\\" if people want to discover pink floyd, i highly doubt they will buy a huge box set like this. if you already have the pink floyd cds, then i suggest heading into wal mart or target (wally world is like1-2 dollars cheaper than target) and just re buying your favorites, i probably will buy, dark side, animals, the wall, the final cut, the division bell, wish you were here, meddle, momentary lapse, again, i will probably, buy the three imersion sets of the floyds most well known 3 albums (dark side, wall, wish) and the expierience editions as well, so it really just depends on your situation, if youre one of those people who will buy this, and then because you bought it you have to figure your financial situation out for the next month, then either just dont buy it, or save the money, and buy it later, OR buy the mp3 collection from amazon, and then just get the hard copies of your favorite floyd classics. the box itself is cool, its different, i was expecting something like the size of the immersion sets, but its relatively small for a collection box, i did like how the cds were packaged inside of the box as well, but if you just get the mp3 of ALL of these, then just buy the hard copies of your favorites, youre not missing out on a lot with the book, its not all that great, and it its just something the company needed to throw in witht he set to make it \\"bettter\\" if this come to you as a gift, then for sure keep it, if this comes to you as a gift, and you already have all the floyd cds, dont even open it! :D if its coming out of your pocket, just give it some thought, youre not going to be TOO disappointed in this set, but there will never be a box set where everything about it is PERFECT so, just give it some thought, like i said, it depends on your situation
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This one has great graphics, game play and options.  It works fine on my Acer Iconia and is very addicting!  Better than the original missile defense game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is great because it has many games on it and it is the best game ever.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|Not alot to say got this as a christmas present for my nephew and he is loving it, but i think his dad is loving it even more. Fun toy for kids of all ages
B005XQLBU4|4.0|i enjoy this game and how it works. i feel that it is well made and fun to play. i would recommend it to anyone.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I love most of Spark's books but this one was not what I thought it would be. I want a love story that has a positive ending, why does he have to kill someone in almost every book he writes?  Im not going into detail because this book really upset me today. I could predict the ending on several hints he gave in the story. I was annoyed by the ending I wanted something different and happy. I read books to escape reality and read about a love that only exists in books. I dont read so I can have reality of someone dying at the end. I gave 2 starts out of respect for the writier otherwise the book its self is worth NO STARTS. If you are thinking of reading this book, read the reviews and get an idea... it's not worth the money and save your self the heart ache.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|the great thing about this game is the ability to upgrade your missiles. it's really addictive and you will not regret spending the 99 cents to buy this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is pretty fun, but some of the first level games are so hard to beat! shouldn't be that hard just starting out.......
B0036EH3U2|5.0|This is TV! Since this ended, I have hardly watched TV. This show had it all. This is a must for anyone who likes to be entertained!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Used to play this as a kid on windows 95. Works great as a touch screen game on my samsung galaxy s 4g.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|nice game, good time passer, kids love it easy to use. I find it a little easy for adults. would reccommend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun and it makes you want to play more because you want to get points to unlock new games! highly reccomended!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the best way to read (or even listen to) the Bible online. -- all for free.  includes all the easy to read versions.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I recently became a fan of this TV series. Very funny, as long as you can deal with the amoral attitude of the show. I wouldn't recommend for youth without adult guidance. Still, it can be very funny and reveals how there is probably more \\"nerd\\" in each of us than we care to admit. The DVD set makes it nice to watch whenever it is convenient.
1592533868|2.0|I received my order 1.5mth after I first made an order for it. The 2nd disappointment was, it came with dog ears on almost every page of the book except the back page. I was so ashamed to give it away as a gift ( as I have originally intended to) that I kept it for myself.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|It is fun but gets difficult faster then it should. Replay value is always a big part of this game, trying to see what works best.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun I got addicted to it though. It was hard at first but once u practice. it gets easier.
0471043729|5.0|Classical textbook. Famous and is on the table of almost every electrochemists. Onlycomplaint is that the price is very high... But this goes true for almost every textbooks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a really fun app and especially cool because its FREE!!  I just wish it was easier to get coins. I have to play boring games over and over again just to buy a new game......but anyways its really cool. good time killer!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|This was the shortest short story that went nowhere. It's almost like he had 1/2 an idea jotted it down and sold it. Not worth the $2.99. Written by the biggest S. King fan- what a letdown.

B0054XOMX4|5.0|My son loves Beyblades and this is definitely one he wanted as it beat every other Beyblade so far with the exception of Hell Kerbecs (Hades Kerbecs sometimes in the US of A, match ended 2:1 for HK). We went to a Beyblade club meeting recently at the local library, and the kids were ogling at this bey. We have a tournament this Saturday and my son really wants to win the tournament with this bey.  Anyway, if you can't get Hell Kerbecs get this as it is the best after HK.  A bit on the pricey side w/$20+ yet you get rewarded so much by your kid which makes it worth every penny.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Nice packing.  The only problem is that the video format does not adjust well to wide screen tv´s.  Other than that, it is a very nice gift for a fan.  Total satisfaction.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love that I can access my info from any of my devices! Great to help keep me organized and to keep ideas that I want to come back to.
B001HN6922|4.0|this movie came to me in excellent condition, the movie was entertaining and exciting, and played off the Cars 1 well.  Mater is hilarious and suspensful never knowing what is coming next.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app I have it on my kindle fire and my Ipod touch. this is an awesome game.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars has some good lessons on life for the younger generation,concitdness does'nt get you to far, needing friends and a good work ethic can carry you a little further than just your self.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games have been keeping me entertained so far and its free so I cant complain! I would recommend it to my. any of my friends!
B005K17RU0|5.0|much better than other apps. provides an active notice of weather and visually much nicer. would suggest over weather channel app.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|awesome game.  ever since Qatari we've been waiting for a format worthy of the idea.  this is it. very cool
0525478817|5.0|I will keep it short and simple: I had high expectations having read all of John Green's other books, but were easily exceeded. Everything was fantastic and it was better than I ever could have imagined. With TFiOS, John Green has surely left his mark.   DFTBA :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this adicting app. I believe it is fun because you can play many different difficult and addicting games. These games are easy and hard but when accomplished you are really happy wheither its easy or hard.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This is definitely better than the post holiday crush of movies that are currently playing at the movies as I write this. If you take exception to this statement, understand that I saw all the good ones around Christmas and that's why I am here talking Contagion.<br />I actually liked this movie despite the fact that it didn't deal with a personal core story as much as fit was a story about how rapidly really bad diseases spread. It reminded me of one of my kids early books called Gossip. The moral in that book is that a little bird tells a larger member of the animal chain something and the information passed from animal to animal gets larger and changes until it is off the charts.<br />What the viewer sees here is akin to the process of something getting spread around. The disease starts out as a sneaky and inexplicable malady that kills and when it picks up momentum, it becomes a race to identify its source and come up with an antidote and manage its spread.<br />Without much more than the slightest thread that links people to one another and make the viewer feel an emotional investment, it still manages to get the viewer squirming. I'm dealing with a cold right now and I felt myself feeling sicker as I watched this on a cushy couch in the family room. Talk about the power of suggestion or am I a closet hypochondriac? Watching the people from the CDC added to the suspense as well as my anxiety.<br />The acting was good as was the script. Though not a weeper, this movie was effective and good. I enjoyed it, it presented me with things to consider given the current political climate, and I did feel better once things got under control in no small part due to the unrelenting efforts by the CDC. Needless to say the environment was ripe for mob violence and depression and there was plenty of that thrown into the mix.<br />Label this as an effective thriller where the bad guy is disease.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is an awesome game very time consuming I could play this for hours at end.   Very good app totally worth it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is really fun, especially on larger screen tablets.  I wasn't expecting much based off of the apps icon, but after reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  Just as you should never judge a book by it's cover, you should not judge an app by it's icon.  This is the perfect game for large touchscreens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very useful and easy to use. easy to move from one book &amp; chapter to another. works well anywhere. ability to save notes is very helpful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun little game to pass time. Plus it is free so you can't beat that. Should have a few more available games on it to begin win.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I have yet to view this DVD but have heard wonderful things about it from my daughter who has seen it during her Christmas visit with us . I received the movie in a timely manner and have a hunch I'm going to love it!
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Yes, \\"Damn dirty humans!\\" And that's what they were. For an ape film, that's not a bad thing as you might know. The original POTA inferred that us dirty humans brought all this hell upon ourselves. This version continues in that same vain by emphasizing how bad we can still be. The actors were a bit one dimensional and flat at times but movie makers sometimes dumb down the banter to reach a profitable audience. All be it, that problem wasn't enough to rip away at the driving intrigue of the film. OF COURSE though, the apes are the stars, as they were in the original and succeeding films. Heston from the 1968 classic, being a star of such talent and magnitude, is an exception to the \\"apes only\\" star rule. The original POTA stands alone, I don't think it can ever be replicated. As a huge ape fan since \\"68, I could see this was a decent way of retelling the apes saga. Because really, that's what this film is, another first in a series that could get very deep with the ponderousness of religion, science, etc.. After the Wahlberg disaster, it's good to see some creative & intelligent minds at work trying to put an acceptable newness to POTA.<br /><br />The film is more a blend of \\"Escape\\" and \\"Conquest\\" (\\"Conquest\\" being the superior) than a remake of the \\"68 stunner. I know some got hung up with medication being the catalyst that advances apes, but it makes sense for a couple of reasons. The evolution model is more fun to play around with, that's true, but with that idea, your possibly doing another Burton bomb remake.<br /><br />I think because most fans were digusted with the Wahlberg mess, the makers didn't want to go down that road again. To counter, rather than duplicate apes evolving over ages, Csears awareness and self growth became it's own mini-evolution overture. POTA 2011 slowly reveals itself to be a pure revenge film. Csears creepiness played well off the wicked zoo keeper. A smart ape staring you down has a viseral punch. Well captured scenes of brooding terror among the apes made me harken back to an old school style of film making. The verbal references to the original were mildly distractive but I realize though there is such an affinity and desire for connectivity to the core, that I took it in stride.<br /><br />CG can either make or break a movie. In this case, for the projection of real apes, it works. Otherwise, it's unlikely I'd get to see a gorilla jump on to a helicopter and the like. POTA 2011 sets the stage for what I can only think will be some mind boggling sci-fi, which is what made the original so powerful.<br /><br /> The real physical bodies of raging apes marauding through streets, bashing windows and crawling along rooftops is grounded in enough purpose for the Planet Of The Apes of this generation to succeed. I will always enjoy the original films (except \\"Battle\\")on a different level. Time and cinema march on. As long as POTA is still alive, we get to indulge in other variations of it's concept, and this interesting film is one of them.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Great game had a lot of fun.  everything was easy to understand and the app worked great on the kindle.
B00009MGGI|3.0|The greasy pole is extra greasy in this trilogy. If one is expecting a grand contest of wills commensurate with a Disraeli v. Gladstone one simply will not find it here. The chief opposition party is almost non-existent throughout the series, and perhaps the greatest threat outside of the party Urquhart - Ian Richardson - leads himself comes from the King who just happens to be an inept buffoon surrounded by equally callow handlers.<br /><br />When surveying Urquhart one is reminded of the line in Plutarch's biography of Crassus just when Crassus is described after his embarkation from Rome on his military adventure against Parthia as 'being old, and looking even older.' Only Urquhart's Carrhae is pitiless Cyprus not eminent Parthia. Good satire is supposed to be plausible, and this trilogy has far too many loose-knots to make it that. A journalist leaps to her death - she is in actuality thrown by Urquhart - from the very place that the prime minister has just exited and no one of consequence suspects any connection even though the woman leaked to her best friend - another journalist - just days prior that she had been having an affair with this very same prime minister? Then of course her journalist friend cannot dispense the story to any newspaper or news outlet because they all think he is crazy. Such a sequence of events begs the question: is every news source in the UK affiliated with Urquhart's party, or does there not exist a single newspaper, journalist, political party, or politician in the whole of Britain that may be intrigued by such a juicy coincidence? This development may be plausible in a banana republic with Urquhart as a caudillo, but in the UK with freely elected politicians, a free-press - with unscrupulous tabloids - and a contentious multi-party system it is not even marginally plausible.<br /><br />The trilogy is also furnished with cliché masquerading as an endeavor at witty irony throughout. One example of this is when a Turkish lobbyist gives Mrs. Urquhart a book as a gift for her husband, and surprise surprise it is, The Prince! (A less anticipated choice for the audience would have been On War by Clausewitz since Urquhart tended to focus on extirpating the center of gravity of his various opponents first.)<br /><br />Despite all these failings - among many other bypassed ones - the trilogy is entertaining and has a sort of sardonic humor to it.
0307891372|5.0|First off the shiping was fast and impeccable.  The guide I recieved was not sealed in plastic but brand spanking new. Great buy, especially at the price!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are a little confusing right off the bat but overall I just couldn't bring myself to put it down
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Don't let the negative reviews sway you.  If you have a small space and want to make more use of your Kinect, then this may be your solution.  This thing worked like a charm for me.  I am able to stand as close as 4 feet away now (instead of 6 feet), and I am fully recognized by the Kinect without issue.  Read the instructions carefully, make sure the Zoom is attached properly, run the Kinect Tuner programs (very important), and understand that Nyko recommends placing the Kinect in front of the TV at between 2ft and 4ft high for best results.  I am very pleased with this attachment.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Today, 01/16/2012 at the \\"[...]\\" they are giving away a great version of this program for your PC.  Works very nice and fluid with many other \\"office\\" type products including the MicroSoft empire's pack.  A very nice option is the seamless connection to \\"box.com.\\"  Work on a document or spreadsheet on your pc, save it to the cloud, and then open it again on your android machine (phone or tablet) with this app.  Seems to be working very nicely on my Kindle Fire and will test it further in the coming days.
0757302661|5.0|I have always wanted an unmedicated birth.  During my second pregnancy, I attended the hospital's \\"Birthing from Within\\" course, only to find it disappointingly useless once I was in labor.  So, after she was born, I joined a few online natural birth communities and saw \\"Hypnobirthing:  The Mongan Method\\" recommended often.  I read it quickly in my third pregnancy, then re-read and savored just a few details.  I'm a visual person, so there were a few things that really stuck with me.  That was all I needed, too.  My son's labor was a 4-hour peaceful event!  The Labor and Delivery nurses didn't believe I was in labor when I waddled in there, until they hooked up the monitors and checked me.  When I received a letter in the mail a few weeks after the birth, there were several comments from the nurses like, \\"Wow, you made that look easy!\\" and \\"You were so calm!\\"  I have to say, it was so awesome compared to my first two labors.  I'm even looking forward to getting pregnant again soon because I'm not afraid of childbirth anymore.  I've loaned my copy to a few friends since my son was born and they liked it, too.  A must have, in my opinion, and I didn't even use the CD.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|I have been a big fan of Magnet Releasing(part of Magnolia)for a long time. They always find the best films that the big boys turn their collective noses at. This movie is just plain funny. If you are a fan of slasher films, this will be a welcoming surprise. Once I watched the trailer, I couldn't wait for it. The film never came to my hometown-most films don't-so when it was realeased on DVD I went for the buy. I was not disappointed. If you like to laugh and you like some good ole fashioned gore...go for it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun. Addicting little app. Great fun. Reminds me of the old Atari missile command game. Here's my extra five words.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Love it! I can't stop playing with this thing. Reminds me of the good old days. I like the multi touch too.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I would recommend this headset to anyone who enjoys good quality products for low prices!

B005HSL626|3.0|Fruit ninja was a good game to play when I was bored but each time I finished playing, I got a &quot;You are today's lucky visitor &quot; or &quot; You won an iPad 2, &quot; which was very annoying. Also when I did get these pop-ups, they usually didn't have a way to close them. Fun game but not worth the time it takes to play the game.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|Despite being a fantastic and beautiful series, the DVDs that we got from Amazon are of very low quality - they continually skip or simply refuse to play. The series itself is excellent but be careful to get a good copy.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds works wonderfly on the kindle fire. The zoom is great espescially with the size of the screen, so you can choose the distance you want while you shoot birds through the air. The ads aren't a bother because they are very small in the corner and will go away. I play this game almost every day and will continue to do so.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I ordered this because of the dog \\"Hachi\\".  Had a dog very much like him that recently past.  My husband and I kept the movie for almost a year before we could watch it.  I cried through most of the movie.  It was a great movie and a good rememberance for me also.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its a great app for killing time, I just wish all the games were open and you didn't have to unlock them to play cause I don't like all of the games.
B0062KJ1Q6|3.0|We rented this from Amazon Instant video and it was fast & simple.  I like the main theme of this movie, but this fell short of being great.  This movie was dependent on slapstick humor and bad language and it was pretty slow getting started.  We kept waiting for the good part to get started, but it never did.  The highlights are in the trailers.  Too bad the story-line had real promise.

B0000B1OFN|5.0|Just watched this movie again after many years...awesome movie! Bought it as a replacement for the DVD we lost sometime and never found...just the case...so glad to have found it on Amazon!
B0006213WG|5.0|In the beginning there was a mixup where I received the incorrect CD which was a gift for my grandson for Christmas.  I wrote a review which prompted Bob Tully to take action and send me the correct one in time for Christmas.  I appreciated the extra effort shown by Mr. Tully. My grandson was pleased getting both CD's by SUM 41.  Thank you
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I realize that other reviewers have noted that the book could have more depth in places. I too would have liked more depth here and there, but then the book would have ended up as long as War and Peace. I was given this book as a gift. I only knew the usual about Steve Jobs prior to my gift, but enjoyed the book immensely. It was both inspiring and sad. I had the impression that the biographer was brutally honest in his portrayal. It makes a marvelous gift.
B005ZUR724|5.0|The 7 inch display is a great size for this game, not too small like on my iphone but not as awkward with the controls like a larger 10\\" display. The game is worth the money (and certainly worth the very small monthly fee) graphics are good and game play is smooth, the User Interface is better than I hoped and you can see Gameloft's history with mobile touch screen devices come through. Everything can be hidden easily or taken out and utilized quickly.  Cons? It is going to use a large chunk of memory on your device. I believe more so than any other Gameloft game I have tried on the Amazon app store. Not a problem with some devices but the Kindle Fire's hard drive space will be feeling the pain of this large download.
B004J4WL50|4.0|This book was great and I read it in a day. Very easy read. I was hoping it was going to be more about the story of Tom's Shoes. I am a sucker for the full story of someone's success. The book has parts of Tom's Shoes story as well as stories of others who are creating change in the world through social entrepreneurship. Great read all in all. Inspires me to create something that creates a profit while giving back.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Excellent remake of the original....kind of. Great cast and special effects and was also left open for a possible sequel..kind of I guess. I liked it and all the other Planet of the Ape movies.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty fun with nice touch controls. Reminds me of the old fashioned version but better. The game could probably use a soundtrack though.
0756405890|1.0|I just finished reading this book and it was a real struggle to complete it. I found the story plodding and formulaic.  The author constantly feels the need to tell you \\"if you've never been really poor then...\\"  Once or twice I could understand, but continually throughout the book it gets very tiresome e.g.  poor lad makes a bit of cash, spends it all, worries where he is going to get his next bit of silver, talents or pennies or whatever.   For such an apparently clever guy you'd think he'd be able to figure out a way to get out of debt. Its these inconsistencies that make this so frustrating.  There is virtually no characterization outside the main protagonist apart from the love interest and the main villain, who are also bot incredibly one dimensional.  But in saying that the main protagonist is also very predictable.  All in all I won't be buying/reading the sequel. My advice, leave this one on the shelf.

B005YDLJ76|2.0|During the behind the scenes concert footage, Beyonce said this isn't about the choreography or the costumes, it's about the music. I don't like to be negative, but this is where the show falls short.  At first glance, it seems Beyonce is going to sing lots of songs. Technically, the Destiny's Child and her older solo hits are sung as listed in the first half. Here's the catch. Most of them lasted between 20 seconds to a minute, with lots of chit chat and video footage intertwined in between. Oh and she got the audience to sing Irreplaceable while she did not do a note of it. Maybe, she did not want to exert herself due to her pregnancy or it was simply a great way to conserve energy. Anyway, the first half with that long set list ends in just 30 minutes.  The second half features tracks from 4. It was a real contrast to the first. Songs are performed in full. The real Beyonce kicks in full throttle, with all that mane tossing, body jiggling and rapid legwork. (This is evident in the first half too but the songs are way too short). Again, there are lots of video footage. Strangely, one of them occupied only a tiny slice of the TV screen, leaving large black borders in between. Did the camera crew do a banged up job, so that they have to use all those unnecessary fillers?  Ironically, clothes horse Beyonce only wore one outfit for the whole show while the DVD booklet is filled with photos of her playing Barbie doll, wearing many different dresses, tresses etc. I, for one wouldn't fault her if she wore them onstage! Fashion shows work for me too, Beyonce Honey!  The show ends after a breezy 75 minutes. On the whole, it was way too short. If I had paid for tickets, I would be very disappointed. I don't think Beyonce is out to shortchange her audience but people could get the wrong idea.  I don't understand why this is called a deluxe edition. Content wise, it does not feel deluxe. A more appropriate marketing term would be extra features. Disc one is the concert and avery brief documentary. Disc two contains seven videos from 4 and a 19 minute behind the scenes. Couldn't Sony put all these into one disc? It felt like they stretched the skimpy contents out on two. Perhaps, Beyonce will go double platinum faster.  Yes, Beyonce is talented, sexy and beautiful and the second half was way better. But I would hesitate to recommend 4. Save your moolah for her other DVDs instead.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Works perfetct, original product. Arrived inside a original apple plastic bag with all identifications. Im saying this because I've bought apple products from other sellers and they work, look original, but they arrived in a nameless cheap plastic bag. This one didnt. Highly recommended
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I rarely review books or app, but this is SO WELL DONE I HAD TO DO IT. The app give you many chooses of the bible and also give you an audio version too. By far my favorite app. If your goal is to read and understand more of the Bible this app is for you.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|Well after a couple months of using it, it works great, but when it arrived I thought it was not an original apple product. It came only in a plastic bag, no brand no nothing, makes you wonder. Fits good, works but I dont think its original.  Oooohh, I almost forgot, I ordered this and the VGA adapter, but when it arrived I only got the VGA adapter, no camera kit. I was so mad, but actually after contacting the seller, they just sent me the adapter back again. I guess they care for customers, but they were not very happy about it.

B005KLAB44|5.0|If you found this item and review you had to brave the amazon maze. WHY is this worth the extra $$?<br /><br />1) It has the original mixes PLUS the bonus tracks from the remix remastered using DSD (a higher definition format for transferring to CD but the CD itself is still 16 bit)<br />2) The replica of the original artwork (which admittedly is the least impressive of the Japanese reissues but then again this was a pretty vanilla release when it came to that)<br />3) It's a limited edition (I'm not sure what that means. You do get a numbered card with YOUR number on it BUT the Japanese roll out these reissues pretty regularly in repackaged forms frequently. Still that doesn't mean this will be reissued like the other titles)<br />4) It's a SHM-CD (the polycardon used to create the CD results in better resolution according to the manufactured with less jitter, more accurate \\"transparent\\" resolution. As with everything, you may or may not believe this but the publicity about the SHM-CD BUT this does sound pretty darn good).<br /><br />Ultimately, it's all for the original mixes of these songs combined with the bonus tracks for this edition that makes this worthwhile. You can however get this for less at CDJapan (but you do have to pay for the shipping which is a bit more expensive from Japan).<br /><br />There are some minor problems with this remaster done by Jon Astley. It's all about the condition of the tapes. They still sound pretty darn good.<br /><br />\\"No Road Romance\\" is a different take than the one on the remix as far as I can tell.<br /><br />There's a glitch of some sort at the beginning of \\"New Song\\". I'm not sure if it's due to tape damage or not (there's some speculation about this) and there might be some minor drop outs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, aside from the Mofi THIS is probably the best I've heard the album (and the Mofi has some alternate takes with some slightly different overdubs for compleists).<br /><br />The production by Glyn Johns is solid throughout but the arrangements and production style is a bit more dated than other Who albums (in my opinion). Townshend still has enough strong material here to make the album interesting and Entwistle has the most songs on an album ever (3--he would equal that amount only on the band's last album \\"It's Hard\\")for a Who album.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks \\"No Road Romance\\" would have made a nice addition on this (or \\"Face Dances\\") album during its original release and while \\"Empty Glass\\" doesn't quite have the lean power of Townshend's solo version on [[ASIN:B000002J6J Empty Glass]], it suggessts what we might have seen if The Who had done it.<br /><br />Recommendedlid throughout but the arrangements and production style is a bit more dated than other Who albums (in my opinion).

B00260HH3K|1.0|this movie is just awful. i feel like i'm repeating what i just typed 2 minutes ago because i just wrote a review for \\"the last airbender\\"  Both movies completely ruin the cartoon. they're a disgrace to the cartoon and they both shouldn't have been made.   Now, i saw this movie a long time ago and if i remember right, goku is in school, i remember him learning how to use ki and shut or opened all the lockers, i dont remember which. . . Why is goku in school to begin with? i remember being excited for this movie to come out. i was so excited to see and the ki blasts like kamehameha and galick gun. but if i recall right there was none of that except like 2 blasts at the end.   I loved the anime. i grew up LOVING the anime, i even spent $40-$45 on each of the 9 dragonball z seasons, 5 of the dragonball seasons, and 2 of the dragonball gt seasons. i even went out and bought all the steel cover movies for like $20 each, point is im a huge fan! and this movie left me disappointed. i love the cartoon so much im even trying to get my girl friend into it since she has no idea what dragonball z is. The movie consists of a lot of shock wave things when goku is learning ki, even though they never do that in the cartoon. now i dont remember much from the movie, but that just shows how awful it is if im a huge fan and dont even remember the only movie that came out. buy the seasons first, dont buy this movie, its as awful as the last airbender
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Three episodes make up the second series and they build to a sensational climax. I'm quite a fan of this modern take on the Holmes character and stories and would allocate 6 stars if they were available. This is because the scripts, direction, acting, plot and so forth are, in my view, streets ahead of anything in the same genre.  I wasn't keen on episode one which introduces Irene Adler. I think there may be two reasons for this. Some of the story seemed silly and I felt a bit let down by the childishness of it all. Secondly I just didn't feel there was any true chemistry between Holmes and the saucy Ms Adler. I was eager for him to admire her mind but we saw too much of her body and I felt very let down by that. Scenes at Buckingham Palace come across as being for an American audience so I'll forgive the producers the eye to the commercial potential across the pond. Episode 3 is so superb it counterbalances my view of episode one hence the overall 5 stars.  Episodes 2 and 3 are fully back on track and just wonderful. Sheer escapism, witty, fast-paced and with memorable performances. Episode 3 had moments of shock and surprise. I would have prefered to be left on a total cliffhanger rather than a partial one but I won't say more to spoil the denoument.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|As a writer of fiction I cannot abide cheesy plots by experienced writers. This is not to say that the plot is bad. It isn't totally. Firstly, it is formulaic. Tweak it a bit and it might as well be Dear John all over again. In writing to get around a plot disconnect I would accept one consequential event per 400 print pages. When they come in bunches and are unbelievable to boot I cannot complement the plot. For example how improbable, even to connect paranormal events, is Jared getting Amanda's lover's heart as a lifesaving transplant after the lover is shot dead? I don't know the odds but the number has got to exceed a million to one, let alone the likelihood of Jared outliving a blown heart valve and heart failure while he is waiting for his mother's lover to get shot in the head by a lout who is so badly concussed that he can hardly stand much less see straight! And the plot sickens.
B0012GMV76|4.0|I am a jazz guitarist and bonafide, card carrying, Jim Hall nut. This is, perhaps, the slickest (typical CTI), big production album Jim Hall has done. I personally feel that smaller combo outings are where Hall really shines, but this is a great listen due to the heavy weight cast (including Paul Desmond, Chet Baker, and Steve Gadd). I would imagine, with it's robust and spirited presentation, that many listeners would view this as his top recording. As a guitar fan, Jim's solos are all very strong and well crafted on this album. I particularly love his solos on \\"You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\\", and \\"Two's Blues\\". He also has some especially nice chordal moments, in particular, his comping behind Chet Baker on \\"Two's Blues\\", and his chordal intro to \\"The Answer Is Yes\\", are classic Jim Hall. It's a must have for any decent Jim Hall album collection, with stellar Jim Hall moments, though not my personal first, or second choice for Jim Hall albums. I will say, as I mentioned in a review of \\"LIVE\\", it took a while to \\"get\\" Jim Hall, and this was the album that helped make him click (I first was grabbed by the entire package and learned to dig Jim). A friend of mine, who took lessons from Hall, reported that this was not one of Jim's favorites, but that's hearsay, and wouldn't hold up in jazz court. Bottom line, it's Jim Hall, so I love it.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is awesome. A wonderful Will Farrell movie if you don't like him. Hilarious. You must buy this great Christmas movie.
B005V4X8JA|2.0|The music is classic.  This review pertains to the quality only.  I purchased this new and the title side appeared to be deteriorating.  The play side had some defects but did play.  I have higher-end equipment and really couldn't tell that much difference between the standard CD and the gold (I owned both).
B000002J6H|5.0|I, like the previous reviewers of this great album, am completely shocked at Mr. McNett's remark underating Stephen Still's accomplishments with CSN AND CSNY.  Without Stills' incredible musical talent, I honestly don't see these 2 albums being the great success that they were.  Stills certainly carried the first album in production and musical instrument participation(just take a closer read at the credits), and,in my opinion, his songs seem to stand out more, both lyrically and musically, in comparison to Crosby's and Nash's.  I certainly don't place him above the others, they were a unique sound and teamed talent TOGETHER, but to say that he was the least accomplished of the 4 is inconceivable (and I'm not the guy from The Princess Bride, either)!!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|What a great way to pass some time! Really enjoyed it. Brings back a few memories of many past hours protecting a town from an unavoidable doom.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|I liked this one. It's one of a handful (so far) of superhero/comicbook adaptations that are actually good. This origin story for Marvel Comics' \\"Mighty Thor\\" has a decent script, good special effects and a simple story arc, with a beginning, middle and end that (hooray!!!) doesn't try to pack too much into one movie. We meet our hero, he faces difficulties, discovers who the enemy is, and defeats them, with modest character growth along the way. Although the bad guy is beaten, they aren't explicitly killed right off the bat (as in so many other super-movies) and by an large the original Thor scenario is preserved from the comic book format.<br /><br />There is some minor tweaking of the Thor and Jane Foster characters (he's not stuck magically switching bodies between the disabled, mortal Donald Blake, and she's a feisty modern career gal, not a wimpy, lovelorn nurse) and although I didn't sense tremendous chemistry between the lead actors, I'm okay with the retconning of their characters: the old '60s soap opera was one of the elements that made the original \\"Thor\\" comic a bit dull. This is a welcome change of pace.<br /><br />Most of all, I appreciate the simplicity of the script, as well as the genuine humorous beats and groovy special effects. I also like that this is a superhero movie that was consciously made to link into another film (\\"The Avengers\\") later on, with plot continuity and room to leave a few loose ends dangling. What kills all the other super-movies is the perverse urge to cram everything in all at once - tell you too much and kill off major bad guys in order to give us a big Hollywood ending. We don't want that: we want The Joker and Loki and Magneto to come back a bunch of times and make life miserable for our heroes. That's how these things work. And, that's what they did in this \\"Thor\\" film. Kudos. Hope they can get Kenneth Branagh and his crew on board for the sequel or sequels. They did good. (Axton)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to write songs i lose notebooks easily and when i find them only the pages i wrote on are ever ripped (how convienent) with this i don't have to worry about it getting ruined if your looking for an app related to making notes or storing information i recommend this
B005IZLPMY|4.0|-----------------------------------------------------  \\"Captain America\\"  (2011)  -----------------------------------------------------  Note: spoilers below  -----------------------------------------------------  This \\"Captain America\\" film has been hailed as the best-est comicbook movie ever: I would say that it's certainly in the top five, and it's pretty good, though there is room to nitpick. It tells the story of Captain America's origin well and telescopes his WWII career into what looks like one big adventure.  This last detail is problematic for me: although there is an action montage which suggests other adventures that could be set in the 1940s, for some reason they bend the original boyscout origin into a scenario that has Steve (Captain America) Rogers sidelined from the action doing USO tours and war bond shows instead of cracking heads on the front lines: he has to prove himself to his cranky, old-school commanding officer Tommy Lee Jones first. Which is fine, except they also have as the climax of the film the semi-death of Captain America: one big battle and then he's literally frozen on ice until thawing out decades later. So... then how does he become the iconic WWII legend that all other Marvel heroes live in awe of??    Once again, Hollywood undercuts its own superhero franchise by cramming too much into one movie. They could've skipped the neutered-hero subplot, then shown glimpses of numerous other battles and *then* had his big showdown with the Red Skull, but oh no, that would have been too much like the comicbooks. Oh, and did I mention that they also (apparently) killed off the Red Skull as well? I'm guessing he comes back via magic, but they made it look like he burned to a crisp? Why? Why \\"kill\\" the hero's arch-nemesis in the first film? Why does Hollywood keep doing this? It's unnecessary and it damages the long-term prospects for building a series of movies around the hero. And why grind your way through so many plot points?  Give the story room to breathe, and the franchise room to grow - don't burn so many bridges right away.  To be fair, this \\"Captain America\\" is much better in this regard than other super-movies and is generally quite enjoyable. I liked the depiction of the silly super-baddies in the Hydra secret army (even though there wound up being too much anachronistic high-tech weaponry in this World War II origin movie) and I thought the prologue where Cap got his powers was well-handled.  I'd like a little retconning of the retcon so that maybe we could have more WWII adventures, maybe even a little Invaders action with the Sub-Mariner and the original Human Torch (who is glimpsed briefly in this film...) Also, it would be nice to see Cap in his bright, primary-colors superhero outfit.  What's the point of wearing the old Red, White & Blue if its buried under layers of parachute straps, canteens and khaki canvas rucksacks? WTF? I know Marvel currently loves the strapped-up Captain America look, but I doubt many fans share their enthusiasm. Let's see him all bright and cartoony! Why wear the flag if you don't let it fly?  Anyway, I thought this was pretty good, all thing considered. Make Mine Marvel!  (Axton)

B0032KNA4I|3.0|Since it's the end of the world,everything must go wrong.So they all go wrong and the movie's makers had to stretch it to more than 2 hours to accommodate the disasters.I've watched it once and that'll be it.Actually I was saying to myself ,enough,halfway thru' the movie.Suprisingly, I never tire of Independence Day or Day after 2moro,both by the same director.If I remember correctly,Roland E said in an interview that this would be his last disaster movie.Now, that's light at the end of the tunnel for you.
0757302661|3.0|The book comes with a CD of guided relaxation, and outlines some breathing techniques in the book itself. I didn't find it as useful as I was hoping. In fact much of the text referred to classes, so if you are interested in reading this as a sole introduction to Hypnobirthing, rather than as an accompaniment to a class you're taking, then it's a little frustrating. I found the assertion that there will be NO PAIN in childbirth rather spurious. I'm also not sure about the author, who seems to have a masters in Education and Hygiene, but is not a midwife or doctor. She has experience as an educator and teaches hypnobirthing instructors (presumably for the classes the book refers to), but after reading several books to prepare myself for a natural birth, I got more from texts by CNMs, and women who have practiced \\"catching babies.\\" Personally, I found Ina May's writing and stories of natural childbirth and midwifery more helpful and informative (even if the language is a little hippy by today's standards).

0553801473|4.0|It took me quite a while to read this book,<br />and I must say that I'm happy about that.<br /><br />After reading several of the reviews posted here,<br />it dawned on me that I should not expect the major plot advances and twists<br />we came to know and love in the series' previous books.<br />This was, indeed, the case.<br />I can fully understand why people gave this book such bad reviews,<br />but for myself I cannot do the same.<br /><br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable book. The plots, intrigues and character building are superb and gripping.<br />I have also enjoyed the magic & mysticism that are beginning to play a much more prominent role in the book,<br />and the fact that very distant parts of the world finally have contact with one another.<br />I think that we are still very far from seeing \\"the big picture\\", and as some have pointed out,<br />it appears we are in the \\"setup\\" stage of the plot. A bit frustrating, but it's my belief that the way will be worthwhile.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that I know<br />we're going to have to wait a very long time before the next book.<br />I'd hazard a guess that many people share my feelings, secretly or openly.
