B0076UXKDG|1.0|The multi-selector and command dials have been inoperable since coming out of the box, so all I have been able to use it for has been the shutter release. For the price, I'm deeply disappointed and plan to return it.  Nikon should be ashamed of itself for this release.

0062206281|3.0|A good read, but doesn't resolve to the level of Shadow of the Wind.  Not in the same league with Shadow of the Wind.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is a great book!! Funny characters with witty banter. A great story line. Amazing chemistry between the main characters. It was so good I couldn't put it down.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Wasn't expecting much from this movie but it really delivered.  So turned off by the Twilight Saga didn't think I would ever like Kristen Stewart again, not so.<br />This was no Snow White for the kiddies.  Charlize Theron is Creepy Bad!  Her acting depth far exceeds the other skinny blonds in Hollywood.<br />I thought Thor was in this movie - who knew there were two of them?
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We have DVD and we enjoy watching it but now we have blu-ray we like it even better.  The picture is clear, crisp and it make you feel like you are part of them.  You have to watch it for yourself.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I admit, I didn't have too many expectations with this film, I thought it would be nice but nothing special--however, I felt like I experienced a bit of disney magic with this story. The characters made me smile and laugh, and I just loved the tender moments in the film where I got a little teary. The HEA was nicely done, with just a touch of romance to make this film even sweeter.<br /><br />Lovely.
0525953728|1.0|Well by the rating and title, if you've gotten this far, I'm sure you might appreciate how uncomfortable I am with such human beings.  Dehumanizing anyone leads to enemy behavior and depersonalization (e.g. \\"fighters\\") rather than engagement and socialization (practically the last things these young men learn from their fraternity).  This allows for them to \\"take out\\" anyone, children, women (and from accounts personally obtained many such have been killed by SEALS despite the clarity of those safe house clearings that the author almost jokingly takes us through.  Don't get me wrong, the SEALs are a prestigious organization and I am proud that they exist.  Perhaps most, if not all, should have enforced family time to become human (but that might redact their taught instincts).<br /><br />I am quite happy OBL is gone, given the account of this character who says he became a SEAL because of such a book, I would think any intellectually capable child would think getting to play war games and act like a bunch of imbiciles during off time a perpetual childhood without a conscience.  Not a choice I hope for for America.  Good work group 6, but how you got to be who you are is reprehensible and disgusting.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i liked it, it was nice :) it isn't that bad. i think that it's helpful. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah :)
B008J344BQ|5.0|This is a great album. Although the songs titles and swearing are geared towards the young (\\"Blow Me (one more kiss)\\", \\"Slut Like You\\", \\"Walk of Shame\\") who want to rebel, this is a very melodic and catchy album. Given the trend towards all this manipulated electronic junk that comes through, this is a refreshing album with a strong voice and instrumentation.<br /><br />This doesn't have the edge or the rebellion of her previous work that had focussed a bit more on the pressures on girls/women to fit in and appeal to others. As the album title suggests, these are all about love from a variety of perspectives.<br /><br />Some songs rock, some are mellow, and some are very clever. I imagine it might be too mellow for some fans (do I sense Ben Folds or Joe Jackson in some tunes? I love the piano and the duet, although the man in the duet is a bit weak), but I love it. I listen to it a lot, and when I'm not, it is going through my head.<br /><br />The last three songs aren't as strong as the first ten.<br /><br />I also bought the clean version because I have kids and wanted to be able to play it on the stereo. I generally don't censor music (e.g. we play Green Day unsensored, also her prior ablums) but this was just seemed a bit too much like cursing just to curse.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love the Percy Jackson series. And the Heros of Olympus has added to the love. Mark of Athena actually overwhelmed me. I laughed I cried it was insane. I couldn't put it down.
0978545095|5.0|A priceless body of work. It's not easy making photographs of \\"real life\\". Vivian makes it look easy. The printing is also first rate. Bravo!
B0086449YA|3.0|OK, here goes. These are my observations and impressions of Mark Klopfler's newest, Privateering. Please keep in mind that I am not a professional reviewer and that when I make observations that I just jot down whatever comes to mind as I make my observations. If you are interested in what equipment I am using to make my observations on? Dodd MLP, Jolida JD100, Musical Fidelity A3cr, 2 custom Tyler Acoustic subs (stereo) and Tyler Acoustic Signature Series Linbrooks with Transparent Reference IC's and AudioQuest CV-8's w/72v BP upgrade. Everything is spiked and/or isolated and subs are on Target stands a little under tweeter height. That said, these are my observations of the newest double CD offered by Mark.<br /><br />The imaging is good, nothing stellar but nothing to shake a stick at either. The noise floor is quiet enough to hear some subtle details and not really be of concern. I can definitely hear influences of a little bit of blues, jazz and a touch of country in this album. It's definitely relaxed, tight and fun. The instruments and singers are well blended with nothing that really overshadows other singers or instruments playing. There are a wonderful selection of instruments that produce a pleasing sound throughout the album. There are many crescendos within the music and each instrument which is very pleasing to listen too. Also, each instrument is easily detectable and clearly heard even during busy passages with the exception of the bass guitar which doesn't seem to be clearly defined and is lacking in detail and texture [compared to other recordings] throughout the album.<br /><br />The beginning of song one on the first disc, \\"Redbud Tree\\" does seem to be a little thick and restricted if you will but does seem to slowly correct over the course of the first minute. Unfortunately, this song is only a 3 minute long song. Overall, the album does seem to shear off a little top end and the overall sound would be what I would consider as relaxed. It doesn't sound bad but it isn't really what you would expect from an in studio recording(s). It almost sounds more like an analog type sound than a digital, even though this review was observed with the CD being played. This is the exact opposite of the first CD's that hit the shelves decades ago. Even though the top end seems to be shaved off, the details and subtleties still exist without exaggeration of anything within the upper registers.<br /><br />With regards to the percussion, I was impressed, as they were recorded well on this album. Pretty much throughout the entire album. The natural rolloff of the percussion instruments equally impressed me as the recording was able to capture this aspect well. Some of the recordings on this album seem to have been either mastered differently or recorded in different studios even though the only mention of a studio is British Grove Studios which would leave me to believe that all of the recordings were done in the same recording studio. Throughout the album it seems as if no trickery or phasing manipulation was added. Just the music which on songs like \\"Kingdom of Gold\\" [one of my favorites] make the background singers sound quite real.<br /><br />I noticed before I started my review that peak limiting had been mentioned. Yes. A lot of times, many instruments will play simultaneously but throughout the album it never seems to get busy or congested as if it were a heavily compressed album. In fact, the album doesn't seem compressed much unless what has been aforementioned is the end result of compression. The musicianship I found to be top notch. The musical content I found to be on par with other MK offerings butpersonally I was hoping for something a little bit newer with regards to the developments but it is definitely nothing to discount just because I was hoping for something that I didn't get. I will say this, with regards to developments? Maybe this is a good thing because he still plays music and doesn't just sing throughout the entire song like most all of today's \\"developed\\" music. Yes, you actually can just sit back and enjoy much of the album's actual music without having the singers constantly taking over the scene. To me, kind of an \\"old school\\" type album which some may like while others may not. Overall, it is a very enjoyable album and a must have in any MK collection....even though I honestly feel it's not his best work. Regardless I found that many times during my observations that I was unknowingly tapping my toes often and I find myself yearning to go ahead and order the deluxe set so that I can see more of the rehearsals, live concert footage and outtakes.<br /><br />Well, there it is. A pure and unadulterated review of Mark Knopfler's newest.<br /><br />Tom

006135323X|5.0|I first purchased this book three years ago and find myself going back to it again and again for a refresher.  It is without a doubt the book I've told more people about over and over again since I've read it.  If you're in sales or marketing this book should absolutely be required reading.  If you just want to understand human behavior and why we make the decisions that we do then it's also a must read.<br /><br />This book takes an in-depth look at why we make the decisions that we do and the reasons behind them.  The author uses a variety of experiments that he oversaw and explains some very surprising results and also talks about some real world examples.  My favorite real world example actually involved Amazon.com.  When Amazon.com went to the model where you could get free shipping with a $25.00 purchase they saw their sales rise across the board overall over all of their businesses across every country except France.  They couldn't figure out why at first and went on to find out that for some reason the French Amazon went to 1 franc with the equivalent of a $25 purchase instead of free shipping.  One French franc is about one penny in US terms, but sure enough when the 1 franc shipping was changed to free shipping in France the sales went up to match the other countries.  Amazing what the power of \\"FREE\\" can do, isn't it?  Even though 1 franc (1 penny) is nothing at all it was still enough to keep people from buying where \\"FREE\\" sent them to the virtual checkout in droves!<br /><br />If you're interested in how the human mind works, you will truly enjoy this book from an educational and entertaining level.  It's not dry and analytic but in a very easy to read and fun manner.  One of the books I think I could recommend to just about anyone!
B00457WZEI|5.0|Through family conflict, war and life concerns, a horse unites people from different backgrounds and countries.<br />Characters are real. The horses bring a beautiful incite to life around them.<br />Nice read.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this book on a reccomendation from a friend and was not dissapointed. A solid science fiction tale following a gifted student picked to go to a interstellar battle school. Excellent on all accounts.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I have enjoyed everything about this the variety of the games involved and would recommend this to anyone who loves to search or enjoy a good mystery!

1932735410|5.0|This is an excellent book for studying for the pmp. Almost all of the activities do a great job of preparing you for the exam. The questions asked in the book are not the exactly the same but very similar. I have read a lot of material both online and text for the pmp exam and this was by far the best book.
0345803485|1.0|As so many people told me this is a \\"must read\\" i gave it a go. Sad, really, that a book of this quality is so popular. In a nutshell, I found it to be a pubescent, utterly predictable romance with an B & D tutorial overlay.The Bondage/Discipline subject is covered with great depth and sensitivity in many other works of art. I can only assume this {s&m, b&d} is the draw for '50' as all other aspects of this pathetic tome adhere to a {very common} formula for romance fiction.
B009SIZHMG|5.0|This episode played just fine, I had no issues and I was pleased with the overall show. I don't know if there was an issue before but it has been fixed. No breaks in the Episode.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|This album is hard to explain. It is a hodgepodge of music pieced together from her entire career. The breadth of the work is unimaginable and quite amazing. From old standards such as \\"Willow Weep For Me\\" and \\"Didn't We\\" to Broadway ballads like \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\", \\"How Are Things in Glocca Mora/Heather on The Hill\\", and \\"Home\\" from the Wiz, this album is top notch. Her vocals are impeccable on every song, with the only questionable one being \\"Lost in Wonderland\\" that I must confess is growing on me. If it wasn't for her perfect pitch and phrasing, the song would have been lost to me, no pun intended. A favorite of mine is \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\", which she recorded in 1970 with the song's composer, Randy Newman, backing her on piano. It is a haunting take on the song and Barbra excels. The wonderful thing about Barbra is that she can really take any genre of music and make it special. Even her most recent recording, \\"If It's Meant To Be\\" a song meant for \\"What Matters Most\\" in 2011 is terrific. Marilyn and Alan Bergman are the perfect duo to construct a song for Barbra. Their lyrics are always paired best with Barbra's stunning voice. The song is beautiful and I'm so glad it has been released on this album.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor...buy the album. If you are already a Streisand fan, this is a MUST-HAVE. If you are not a Streisand fan...get ready to become one. It's hard to resist her incredible gift...no wonder she is the best-selling female artist of all time.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The light and sounds are dead on, but it does not feel solid at all. i am afraid to break it every time it extends. It is just a toy so what can you expect though.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|This movie is about a family who maybe never died but were born from a family of creeps, ghouls and monsters. It is about how they have to fight for their house and money. It is fun to find all the creative things they did to make the house unique and scary. They have a chemistry room, a torture room, an empty ballroom that manifests into a halloween party with all their friends who aren't human. They eat creative yucky food from a cauldron hot with recipes from the other side. Doors that turn into twisty turny slides that lead to a sea in the dark except for white christmas lights swinging on a dock with a gondola ready to take Mr. Adams and Fester to a special vault. Little doors that open out to the front lawn if you pull on chains in the ceiling. Ricci plays the pretty younger girl who is stern and likes to play games that scare her younger brother. The motel where they sit and eat pizza and all sorts of junk food with their pet thing uncertain of where life will take them.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is a very informative and addicting in a good way website. You can find almost anything you are looking for.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read The Hunger Games in 2 days leaving only enough time to sleep and take care of my son. Did I shower? Anyway, this book is just as addictive as the first! I've refused to watch the movie until I've finished them all. In my head, I picture Katniss as the girl in the movie, but only to a degree.  I think I managed to avoid it just enough to create my own faces for the characters, which is easy to do. The way Suzanne Collins has written this... you have a vivid image of every character, every scene, every \\"muttation\\" which makes the book that much more irresistible.
0525958002|3.0|As a lifelong fan, Jt was the reason I picked up the bass guitar. I could not wait for this book but at about a 1/3 way through realized he was going to skip a lot of things. After reading Andy's book I was hoping for as much detail but sadly doesn't even come close. Definitely worth a read for a fan but there are many well known D2 events he completely ignored. Hardcore fans may be disappointed.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan has create another master piece.  The Percy Jackson series was awesome and the Heroes of Olympus series does not let you down.  The action flows and the swtich between the characters keeps the reader on the verge of their seat.  Cannot wait for the next book
0307744434|5.0|Mystery, magic, romance, and a constant wonder at where the plot is taking you. What's not to like? A great read.
B009AMALLM|2.0|A big fan of this series (my name even gets a fan credit in #1!), I thought the trailer for PA4 was awful. And the \\"viral campaign\\" never took off like it did for #2 and #3. It was as if even those involved simply weren't very committed/interested in the film they were making.<br /><br />The reviews were ALL tepid--even those that sort of praised it--and word of mouth was dismal. The \\"actual people watching the film\\" TV ad was so over-the-top, it became a joke.<br /><br />And then the film itself was a mess. Why have the wink-wink \\"in jokes\\" of the kid riding the bike like THE SHINING? It takes us \\"out\\" of the movie we're watching...and ads zero to the film. Same with the first<br />fake\\" drag scene of the girl. Again, why remind us that we're watching a movie, why take us out of the experience?<br /><br />And NOTHING happens for so long into this movie, it's just people talking and talking and talking. The few little scares are already shown in the trailer, which they have done before...but those are the ONLY scares! So we are not surprised.<br /><br />And it's clear that the writers/directors had no real ideas of what Toby was to do this time. In other words, WHY does he levitate the girl? If the goal is to kill everyone, that just do it. The levitation scene is simply to impress US, the viewers. But we've seen that before, in a dozen films...and in the trailer! So there is no shock or surprise. And why bounce the ball down the stairs? And why is there scene after scene in the dark with the xBox? Toby is \\"better\\" than moving some dots around but they feature that xBox feature into the ground.<br /><br />Finally, the ending (no spoiler, if you've seen PA3)...is the SAME ending as PA3. We learn nothing. In fact, you can remove PA4 and you've learned NOTHING. When PA5 comes out, hopefully the filmmakers have learned from the dismal box office, word of mouth and reviews for PA4 to PUT THE SCARES BACK IN. And have a REASON for the film.<br /><br />All the above being said, I WILL buy PA4 and here's why: I wasn't that impressed with PA3 in the theater but the extra footage--not much, just a few scenes of Toby messing with the girls more--made for a MUCH more \\"sinister\\" film. Not sure why they were cut from the film, but they really add to PA3. Same with PA2--and maybe these movies are just better seen at home.<br /><br />So, here's hoping that PA5 will really deliver. They know what a mess PA4 was, so let's hope they have learned their lessons.

B001HN6922|1.0|The Cars 2 DVD was sealed from the factory (or so it appeared) but when I tried to play it for my son's third birthday it would not play past the third chapter/scene. I inspected the disc and found no scratches or imperfections in the disc. I don't blame the company that sold it or Amazon I think it was just a flaw from the DVD factory in China.
1455527475|5.0|Liars Poker is one of my favorites, but Greg Smith goes even further. He not only takes you through the detailed ups and downs of a demanding career within Goldman's Equities Division, but he puts the economic and political environment in perspective. This book serves as a powerful insider's rendering of 12 years of survival and success at this storied investment bank during multiple tumultuous periods. Strongly recommended for Wall Street insiders and others curious to learn about what goes on inside  !
B004XANKVO|3.0|There are many nice things about this backpack.  I won't repeat some of what others have said.  The disappointing parts based on my long experience using backpacks for laptops everyday:<br /><br />- Some of the outer compartments have only one zipper.  Two are necessary to use a small lock for secured items.  One compartment does have a fabric loop to use a lock on.  Fabric and lock is not secure nor smart for a design.<br /><br />- The zippers themselves have a slide off plastic holder on each one.  There is no easy way to use a lock for any of the compartments.<br /><br />- The backpack lacks smart like pockets beyond iPod, IPad, and Laptop.  With all the space, it is not well utilized.<br /><br />- The side pockets are not big enough (nor do they stretch) to hold a simple Ice Mountain water bottle - let alone any reusable bottles I have.<br /><br />- The cross-body strap is annoying and in the way when not used.<br /><br />- Although the laptop holder is suspended from the bottom slightly, there is almost no cushioning on the bottom of the backpack.  I had to add padding myself on the inside of the two main compartments.<br /><br />- While the bottom compartment seemed like an interesting idea, it is almost useless.  The entire backpack contents and most of its weight sit on that compartment.  It is difficult to get my Apple 85w adapter into it.  Once I do, it fits ok but creates a hard element at the bottom of the bag which is not wise for between a hard floor and the internal contents.  The bottom compartment is better not to be there at all.<br /><br />- The backpack is not self-standing on the ground or table surface.  Surprising for such an expensive and large backpack.<br /><br />- No strap management for the front straps for the front open-ended compartment.  They stick out five+ inches if I don't manually pin them to the bag.<br /><br />Summary:  While the main compartments and padding (not the bottom part which lacks it) are nice and the straps comfortable, there a design flaws that make it a 50/50 chance that I will return it (I just received it a day before this review).  Many of the issues listed above I can avoid with half-price bags at OfficeMax and the like.  (Of course, I would still buy those from Amazon - cheaper and good return policies.)
B004EPZ070|1.0|The movie started off ok and though Kate Hudson's character was a little one dimensional it wasn't bad. Then it changed. What I really did not like was the relationship that formed between her best friend and her fiancee. After I watched the movie, I was so upset because it brought up all the feelings of my ex-husband cheating on me and ending our marriage. I was not prepared for the cheating and coverup in this movie of the fiancee and the friend's sexual encounters and I did throw this movie away. I would caution others and I did my friends of what to expect.
B00177E1Z0|5.0|For those who loved the music of the 1980's this is a must have.  One of the top movies of the 1980's.  This is one of the best soundtrack with some of the greatest artists.  Highly recommend getting this!!

B001IF252M|4.0|I have two of these -- one I bought from this retailer and one I got from Apple store.<br /><br />I have two external screens.  One is a newer Dell and the other is an older Dell screen.<br /><br />Using the one adapter I got from Apple, both screens light up well.<br /><br />I tried the adapter from this retailer on my newer Dell and the picture looks bland (enough that I was ready to return the adapter).<br />I tried it on my older Dell and the picture looks as ok as when I used the adapter from Apple store.<br /><br />I don't know why it works on one screen and not the other.  But, since it works on one of my screens and seems reliable (had it for a few weeks using it 5 days a week), I'll keep it.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I had been seeing advertisements for Sons Of Anarchy and thought it looked interesting but never really sat down and watched it. When I became a Prime Member, I noticed that I could watch the first three seasons of SOA for free. Well, after watching the second episode of the first season, I was hooked. I was SO glad that I had three seasons ahead of me that I could watch anytime I wanted to because I flew through them. One of the most striking things I noticed about Sons is that main characters in the show get killed off regularly and it leaves you shaken because it's rarely done in most shows. But because all the characters are strong, you are not left with a gap when one of them is eliminated. You never know what to expect with each episode. My original plan was to watch the first three seasons for free hoping that by the time I got to the fourth season, it would be free also. Didn't happen. I ended up paying $20 to watch the fourth season (totally worth it), and now I am recording the episodes of the fifth season. On the last episode, Jemma wrecks the SUV with Jackson and Lara's kids in it because of her drug use. Again, it's that OMG feeling because you never think that Gemma would do something like that with her grandkids in the vehicle, especially after Lara's hesitancy to let Gemma be around the children. Now you're thinking, what is Jackson and Lara going to do?....what will Wendy (the mother of Jackson's oldest son) do? Gemma harassed Wendy unmercifully and now she (Gemma) is doing pretty much the same time. I can hardly wait until the next episode...

B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I haven't written a review on here before, but i just had too for this movie. What else can i say other than this is probably one of the greatest, if not greatest, Christmas movie I've ever seen. Christmas is my favorite time of the year and the holiday has a lot of meaning to me. When watching this I've never felt more Christmas spirit come alive inside of me. It was also the first time I've ever balled my eyes out from watching a movie. I had to wait until everyone left the theater so i could keep some of my manhood intact haha. But anyways if your on the fence about this movie DON'T BE! It's that good! I definately will be watching this every year during the holidays until the day i die

B004J4WLB4|4.0|This is about a girl who has just about every disadvantage in life you can think of.  She finds her niche in working with flowers.  The story takes the reader through the ups and downs of Victoria's life, as she discovers what works and doesn't work in getting along with people.  Flowers help her explain her feelings and communicate with the people she comes to love.  Flowers really do have a language all their own.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I pre judged based on the title, thinking it was some horror movie, but was introduced to this wonderfully creative movie by my children. We would watch it every Christmas Eve when they were little, and have had the chance to introduce it to their younger cousins. The music and lyrics are fun, the story amazing, it's just a great movie all around.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Every time I re-watch Contact, I see elements used in films that followed. Twister comes to mind because I just watched it last night. The fisty little research team leader (Jodie Foster) who has \\"problems\\" related to the early loss of her father. Her movie love story. The excited scenes on the part of  her all-male team of young, quirky, support staff, and the characters that include the crazy, dressed in flowers, curly-haired, blonde, junk-food eater, details that make for the action and the characters. Contact is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I guess it is many others' as well. This copy is in great shape, including the sound, which is so important to the film. Color: excellent, and what can I say? Thank you, Rasputin, for the quality of this product!
B00634GHJA|5.0|Well as a newbie with very few resource available, at least ones with an almost non-existant learning curve, I really appreciate this app.  It let me transfer photos with minimal fuss.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a truly heart warming story and I fell in love with both main characters instantly. I eagerly awaited bedtime so I could find out what happened next.Overall a good read.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Too much confusion at the beginning. Story line finally sorted itself out and was a good read until the summation.  When did our hero get the opportunity to confer with the police to set up the sting at the end?  Is this \\"Kindle Condensation\\" of the novel?  I am assuming I am purchasing a full length novel.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I use it everyday.  Its interface is much better than the source article's which makes reading information and navigation much easier.
B008NABUU8|4.0|I am running this app on a HTC Detail with 512MB of RAM and the Android 2.2 OS.  I am telling this information because the app runs very slow for me between screen transitions.  I do not know if it is the app or my phone that is the issue on this.<br /><br />The app is very simple; there is a chasm, build a bridge.  Once the bridge is built, see how much weight it can hold by driving either cars or trucks over it.  You have certain materials you can use to build each bridge and a budget that you cannot exceed.<br /><br />Personally, I find the app to be fun.  It reminds me of the engineering class I took in high school where we would have to build model bridges and have them tested for weight load.<br /><br />The slow transitions between screens is the only downside I have found so far (hence the 4 instead of 5 stars).
0385344333|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book I was disappointed because it didn't have enough of the usual Jack Reacher violence and sex like the other books. I thought it was a little flat and somewhat predictable. Usually Jack Reacher is knocking people around and the plot twists and turns until you're not sure who ALL of the bad guys really are. Jack was not heroic enough in this for me and there wasn't even a romantic connection. Lee Child didn't get enough into the guns and shooting and velocity of the bullets and how to aim his gun and all......which I don't really understand when I read it but I love it that Jack Reacher knows all of that stuff. That, to me, is thrilling to read and a turn on but it was pretty much missing in this book. It was good and I'm glad I read it but it wasn't the best and actually is pretty close to the bottom of my list of the Jack Reacher series of books.
B00004W221|5.0|Let me start by saying I've been a Notre Dame fan my entire life, so this review will not exactly be objective.<br />First off, any major Notre Dame fans will love it.  Great movie that will inspire and motivate to work hard, persevere and go after your dreams.  That said, in trying to peel back as best as I can from the ND bias, I would offer the following<br /><br />The cast is fantastic for what may seem to be a fairly narrow plot line on the surface.  Though several movies have taken a similar angle in recent years, 20 years ago this was a fresh spin on the sports tie-in to perseverance and individual will.  The music has become iconic, used in commercials as recently as 2011.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It was a little slow to me and the ending could have been better.  It wasn't as racy as I thought it should have been.  The previous book was better.
B00846REIS|3.0|If you want to read another Christian/Ana tale, read this Gideon/Eva book. Exact same thing, just shorter and not as good.
B00563M11M|4.0|I enjoyed Snuff a lot more than the last few books in the Discworld series. This latest book was a bit lighter and enjoyable to read.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I usually dont mind musicals but I couldnt get through this one. I would not recommend this movie. There are better movies out there.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Follows the nicely organized previous four books in which each character's and its environment at every stage of the whole story is neatly presented. Can't wait for the next book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I knew after playing the free version for about five minutes, that I would buy the full version!  great animation.  wonderful storyline.  and its not the kind of game you will solve in 30 minutes.  every time I thought I was close to finishing, I was given a new mission.  well done Big Fish - looking forward to the next installment very much!!
B008NAFU9A|4.0|I bought this book for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. I even started reading it when she isnt home and its actually pretty good, has a great story line and I cant wait to finish it lol.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I'm  addicted to this game on facebook now i have it on my kindle fire my husband is never going to get me off it lol
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read much, I just don't have the time. In fact I don't have time to be writing this review but I felt it was my duty after reading this masterpiece of a book. I could not put Wool down, and for me that was a bad thing because I ended up spending a few late nights reading where I wasn't able to put it down when I should've been sleeping. For the money, buying this book is a no-brainer and I appreciate not wasting my time or money on boring or dull reads. Wool will have you trying to guess what's coming, wondering what you would do, and connecting with characters that are completely relatable (Jules).<br /><br />Loved the book, can't wait to read the rest of the series, as I have time that is.
B0028T6XXY|4.0|The man has a smooth, easy-to-listen to voice.  Anyone who like a &#34;crooner&#34; will love Michael.  A really easy listen.
B005SAV9SO|4.0|Cameron Diaz, while not one of my favorite actresses to be honest, performs a pretty hilarious role in Bad Teacher. She's probably one of the worst teachers ever (or best depending on your perception!)<br /><br />She humiliates, criticizes and degrades her middle school students and makes it a daily occurrence.  She tells one boy for example that he'll never get it on with a girl until he's 29 since he wears the same shirt 3 times a week.  Hey, maybe that's why I never scored with the ladies- they don't like it when you wear the same shirt everyday.  Oh now I get it. :)  She doesn't like this one female student either because of the high and mighty way she acts, so Cameron criticizes her rot gut cookies, the girls uptight tattle tale demeanor, and basically throws her out to the dogs.<br /><br />So, why does Cameron Diaz even HAVE a job if she treats her students like crap and does nothing but plays movies for them all period because she's too drugged or lazy to teach?  Because just *look* at her.  Nobody can resist that body!  Just watch her moves at the car wash for goodness sake!<br /><br />Of course there's one person that doesn't like her.  Another teacher played by Lucy Punch.  When Cameron has eyes for the new hot teacher, Lucy's character is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure Cameron can't have him.  Lucy Punch actually makes this movie watchable.  Cameron's acting is questionable and on several occasions doesn't even feel comfortable portraying this kind of character, but I do admire raw and offensive humor so the movie gets a free pass from me.  It's honestly not *quite* as offensive as I thought going in, but it's crude enough.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Love this app. its easy to use and better to navigate through compared to the website version. i am glad I purchased this app. it makes everything easier- tweeting, viewing trends, favorites, etc. it has actually made me more addicted to twitter then i was before.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story line in book two is more engaging than that in book one. It's interesting to see the relationship develop between Christian and Ana...and the reader really feels invested in finding out more about Christian's back story. It's a quick and good read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The only reason why I rated Mockingjay 4 out of 5 is because i read all three of the books in the series and my favorite is the second one. they are all good books but this may be my least favorite so far. then again im not finished with it. the books are cheaper here then in the stores and its a very good interesting easy read. i would buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome... nothing I have to say about it is bad! you don't need internet!  like everything eltse on here! its worth the money get it its awesome!
B007REA0SO|5.0|I gotta say being the fact I always wondered who sung that song in the helicopter scene in Predator, google, and boom Im on Amazon. My jaw was open at how awesome his music is, if you don't stomp your feet and groove along your dead. Being many generations too young to even know who this guy is I gotta say wow good buy for fans and the casual or accidental fan like myself. Love this collection.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Absolutely amazing! What a gift she has given to us all by sharing her experience. We are all blessed by her words.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|I like this game..I would probably purchase the full game in the near future. I will also tell my friends about it
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Awesome album! If you're a lover of the first album, like I was, you will love this album too. Before you listen to the previews and decide you hate it, realize that it takes about three full listens to the entire album until you can really appreciate it. Then, you will love it more and more each listen. Give it a chance and you will NOT be disappointed.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This book was excellent. I love the characters and the story I just found the book was too short. I didn't want it to end :( and I hate having to wait for the next one, which I guess shows how much I really enjoyed the book.
B004OC07GM|5.0|I got the kindle version. Was recommended by many and I found it very helpful. A must for everyone who want to innovate.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this. whomever created it was a genius. I've planned my wedding &amp; birthdays with this. I've gotten meal ideas. just great overall.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book has taken me longer than usual to read, partly because of my schedule and partly because it was a bit hard to get into it. However, it is SO worth the effort. This is a fantastic book. The world building is phenomenal! Down to the last, tiniest details, this world is fascinating. It also has a new (which shouldn't surprise anyone with Mr. Sanderson) system of magic. Stormlight captured in jewels provides power. There is quite a cast of characters. The plot lines developing are interesting and complex. I can only hope that Mr. Sanderson is a fast writer; I NEED the next installment!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|I am so glad to finally own this movie.  It is such a classic.  All the extra features were fantastic except the feature that is supposed to show you all the audience participation prompts.  It was a live video of a theater with the audience screaming out their portions...not easy to understand or follow.  Even with that, it was a good purchase.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Technicians tell me that the instructions for preparing a book for uploading aren't helpful to Mac users. I find that for the PC, the instructions work. If Mac-using technicians are left out, then I suggest revising the book to include that platforms menu commands.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Love the concept of this movie and I believe in it totally.  I've had similar experiences.  It's the kind of concept that we don't talk much about in life.  We talk about making choices, but never really review what chance can do.  Fantastic movie!!!
B0019IB0II|5.0|For all of us who are left brain thinkers--highly organized, logical--this book is a must.  It gives a clear description of the magic of the right brain and encourages us to exercise it more.  The book has definitely helped me to rethink my thinking.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Book is similar to 50 Shades but a little more graphic.  Gideon and Eva are both trying to hide problems from their past.  Their problems surface when they start a very fiesty relationship and their past problems bring out many conflicts between them.  This book was a great read and I could not wait for the next book to arrive.
B003XU02QG|3.0|McNulty (Dominic West) should have been the lead, but was still awesome here. The female lead was eminently watchable, even if she didn't speak much. Well cast, again. Quintus however was unconvincing, and by the end I didn't feel much for him, but it's not the actor's fault. They should have spent more time developing his character. All of the characters could have used a little more attention. Needless to say, the movie was action-packed, even if a little over the top. If the movie had been a little bit longer and spent a little more time examining the characters and it would have helped. Although the movie touched on it, I would have liked to have seen more treatment of how the politics back home conflicted with the legionnaires' struggles and in-the-field experiences to create an untenable situation. Not unlike Washington's politics and our own challenging foreign problems leading to difficult, nightmarish situations for our military. 3 stars.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I have been caught up in the Crossfire series.  Second novel in the Crossfire series is just as good as the first \\"Bared to You\\".  Gideon and Eva continuing in their relationship but while Eva has revealed her past problems Gideon is still having trouble talking about his past which causes great problems in their lives.  A great read and I cannot wait for the third novel in this series to become available.
B00005JL96|5.0|Fun movie, service could have been faster. My five yr old twins love it, but it is a bit too \\"old\\" for my three yr old to understand.
B0001I55NS|5.0|I tried to get this movie on Netflix but it was always .....waiting a long time....I'm glad I bought it and can watch it anytime.  I received the movie very timely and the quality was outstanding.
B008GVD6D8|1.0|I understand that the theme behind Fifty Shades of Grey was popular and I myself loved the series, and I was looking for an equally erotic series but this series offers nothing original!  Sylvia Day writes well but has basically changed the names of Christian and Anastasia and followed their storyline. Something new please!!!
0156027321|4.0|Knowing only that this novel has been incredibly popular and that some have claimed that it is proof of God's existence, it has been on my \\"must read\\" list for a number of years. And so I finally read it. I was prepared to read a rousing adventure story of an Indian boy's survival in the Pacific Ocean aboard a life boat he shares with a Bengal tiger. And in this respect, the book supplies abundant rewards. Martel is a magnificent storyteller. He creates remarkably genuine characters, and he relates events in seamlessly beautiful, artistic prose that is at once clear, stunning, and sublime. What I was not prepared for, however, was the postmodern metafictional nature of this narrative. Although it may not become apparent until the very end of the novel, when Pi tells his incredible story of survival to a couple of Japanese government employees, Martel's novel is all about the creation of story--about the ability of language to construct \\"truth\\" from mere words:<br /><br />Isn't telling about something--using words, English or Japanese--already something of an invention? Isn't looking upon this world already something of an invention? (p. 302)<br /><br />As Martel implies, nothing is true or real until language legitimizes it. The novel itself is a construction of embedded narratives--it begins with Martel (or a Martel-like narrator) telling of his encounter with a man who directs him to Pi, who then tells his story to the narrator--who in turn relates it to the reader. For a portion of the novel (the first quarter of it), the narrator weaves his voice together with Pi's and tells the story of how Pi told him his story. And the novel ends with the Japanese agents' rendition of their meeting with Pi, during which he tells them two vastly different versions of his story.<br /><br />All of this meditation on the nature of narrative and story prompts me to reflect on the way in which I read this novel--as I read it, I was looking for evidence that this novel was about the existence of God, the meaning of faith, etc. What I found instead was a very well-written and entertaining adventure story that--like the subject of religion (which is surely present in the novel)--serves as an extended metaphor for a much broader theme: the eternal question of epistemological uncertainty and the various ways we choose to cope with that uncertainty.existence of God, the meaning of faith, etc. What I found instead was a very well-written and entertaining adventure story that--like the subject of religion (which is surely present in the novel)--serves as an extended metaphor for a much broader theme: the eternal question of epistemological uncertainty and the various ways we choose to cope with that uncertainty.
B000001EL7|5.0|i had this album back in the day... i think i was in 7th grade. it was good then and its still good now. sounds is much better than the old LPs. love gun is one of the best songs paul stanley ever wrote !
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Move over chicken tikka masala, this is fiery hot lamb vindaloo! Amazing epic of modern India in bold masterful strokes, Gregory Roberts pours molten passion and painful reality into his writing that makes this a most readable and enjoyable book. Fast paced yet deeply philosophical, this is Herman Wouk meets Eckhart Tolle. The pain, the sounds, the smells, the love and yes the dance fairly jumps at you from this book. More than just a great read, this is definitely a personal library piece! I rarely hope to come across two books in a year that would make me gush, this definitely is one of them.
B000001ESF|4.0|i used to listen to this album every moring while i was painting the house in 1981. it blew me away then. it blows me away now. overture and the temples of syrinx are just incredible songs.the vocals are raw and angry. the drumming is non-human! the end of the song gets a little wimpy and some of the other songs are not as good in my opinion. that's why i give it 4 stars.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Great song. So good to know that Adele can still sing after her recent health challenge. I hope that the movie is as good.

B003YV64OI|5.0|This is a serious question......why would you?!  For the performance/dollar ratio, it's unbeatable....<br /><br />Like most other reviews will point out:  this is a quad core!  Most motherboards should not give you a problem unlocking it.  If they do, upgrade your bios and you should be set.<br /><br />A 3.2ghz quad core that runs quite cool (about 43c idle/55c load with limited air flow and a stock cooler, around 33c idle/45 load with a $20 cooler) for $65??!?!?!?<br /><br />I never thought I'd see the day.<br /><br />Many of my friends and I run these chips and LOVE them.<br /><br />It won't beat out my i5 750 @ 4.2ghz under tests and heavy loads, but at the same time I won't ever really notice the difference.<br /><br />Any time a friend is thinking about starting a build I get them to get one of these.  Save $100 on just a chip?  Yes please.  I'd rather put the money into a SSD boot drive, a better GFX card, and/or better power supply.  If you run this chip in an extreme gaming rig with the same exact setup as another computer minus the fact that it had an i7....you would see very little difference (in gaming).  Anyone that wants to argue about this will do so all day, but there's no point in listening to elitists when it comes to this CPU... just get it.
B0002HN14I|2.0|This is a SACD that sounds bad. The violin work is very nice but the recording is not good. If you are into sound quality I do not recomend this CD.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|Promtheus(released May/12)stars Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers,Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw,Michael Fassbender as David,Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland,Logan Marshall-Green as Charlie Holloway,and many others in this solid cast.<br />The film opens as we float over a barren and desolate landscape.Standing on the edge of a precipice beside a Niagara like gorge,is a humanoid looking alien who drinks a strange black potion.As it courses through his body he literally falls to pieces and into the water,which reforms in it as new strands of DNA(ours?).Fast forward to 2089 and the Weyland Corporation has hired two archeologists to accompany one of their space ships to a distant galaxy/planet,which matches the grouping found in an ancient cave in some wall art.Of course this demands the use of cryogenic pods,as the distance takes over two years to reach.A lone android by the name of David,presides over the ships functions and reawakens everyone when the ship nears its destination.<br />They enter the planet's atmosphere,which is covered in clouds.As they finally get close to ground the sky opens up,and as they search they spot a large long \\"runway\\" which leads to a larger dome like structure;obviously not natural.Part of the crew exits the ship and enters the dome.They have artificial round drones that start to automatically map the interior.It is a huge complex and the Android David,who has spent much of his alone time deconstructing a myriad of languages,scrolls and ancient texts,believes if they contact any life,he can more than likely communicate with them.They run across some strange symbols on the walls and in short order David is gaining access to the inaccessible.He first activates a hologram which has holographic images of giant humanoids running through the corridors.They follow them which leads them to a large door with one of the creatures actually dead in front of it(decapitated).David gains them access through the door and into a chamber with a large head at the back of it,human like in shape.Leading to it is an area filled with sleek short stubby topped tubes with something in a black liquid inside them.Around all of them are shallow trenches into which the excess liquid drains.The rest of the crew takes the disembodied head of the dead alien back to the ship,while David secretly takes back one of the tubes.<br />Most of the crew make it back but two members stay behind because of a storm that comes up very quickly.David asks Charlie how far he would go to find out the truth of what is going on,and he answers as far as he would need to.They both drink a toast to that,but David has slipped a tiny portion of that alien black liquid into his drink.Back inside the dome the two men are roaming the room with the head and tubes.Suddenly a long thin neck with a bulb like head pops up from the liquid trench.At first the one thinks it cute until it latches onto him,envelopes his arm and eventually gets inside his suit and his mouth.The other man had tried to cut the creature off and got sprayed by its \\"blood\\",which ate through his helmet and he collapsed.The crew from the ship make it back to aide the two men,too late of course,but by now Charlie has become seriously ill.By the time they make it back to the ship ,he is in real dire straights and looks terrible.The ships head,Ms.Vickers,over rules everyone and won't allow him to contaminate the ship and carries a flame thrower to back herself up with.Charlie asks her to go ahead and incinerate him and she indeed does,as his girlfriend Elizabeth screams in agony.<br />It is around this time we learn that company founder/owner Mr Weyland is alive and on board.He is dying but is anxious to see if the alien on board,what they now have determined is an actual alien ship,can help him cure the disease he has.David had discovered(on his own of course)the ship control room and an actual alien pilot in stasis there.In the meantime Ms.Shaw has learned she is three months pregnant by her late boyfriend Charlie,whom she had relations just a day before.David refuses to tell her what the fetus looks like so she takes it upon herself to have it surgically removed by an on board medical machine,after David refuses to perform the procedure.What comes out is a small snake like creature which is held in the tube after she leaves it.<br />Shaw accompanies Mr Weyland,David and others over to the alien ship's control room where they awaken the alien.He is not a happy camper and sets about killing as many as he can before the rest flee,and then starts up his craft.Shaw and Vickers flees the craft,warning that the alien ship must be stopped,because it is taking its payload to Earth,which will be infected and destroyed.As the huge alien ship lifts off,the captain of the Prometheus puts his ship on a collision course and brings his ship and the alien one back to the ground.The huge alien ship kills Vickers as it settles back on the ground and Shaw barely manages to live through it herself.She makes it back to the wreckage of the Prometheus but soon hears Davids voice over the intercom.His disembodied head is still lying on the floor of the alien control room and he warns Shaw the alien pilot is coming her way and looking for revenge.When he arrives they struggle near the sick bay where the creature taken out of Shaws belly has now grown into a huge tentacled monster.She opens the door and it grabs and envelopes the alien pilot,depositing its egg within its stomach.Shaw escapes to the alien ship and retrieves David's disembodied head and his body to take with her.David claims he can pilot another alien craft,of which there are others on the planet.To Davids surprise,she wants to find out where the aliens are from and wants to go there to seek answers.The film ends as a young alien(the type we are more used to seeing)bursts out of the dead alien pilot's chest,standing on its spindly legs and screeching.<br />I recall Ridley Scott being so very coy in avoiding any comparison of Prometheus to the Alien movies before its initial release.But I think it safe to say that this is defintely part of the Alien franchise,a pre-quel if you will,and what a doozy.Like the first one it slowly but surely pulls you in and from then on you cannot help but be a \\"prisoner\\".The film begins with alot of questions and ends with as many.I like Scott's editing and pace.A fine example is the scene where David brings up the alien holographic schematic of our galaxy.The music rises in crescendo and it is a gorgeous moment of discovery(and visuals)by the character,and instead of lingering on and enjoying the moment to its fullest,the schematic suddenly ends(sooner than one would expect)and we're off once again.Scott had alot to tell and obviously didn't want to get bogged down in any one area too long,which enhances the entire dynamic.<br />Along the way we are seeing hints and visual cues of the familiar,from the Alien cannon.The egg shaped cylinders in the \\"head\\"room(not unlike the more rounder versions the later Queens laid),another android(David)which,if you know anything about the Alien franchise,you NEVER trust,the Weyland company name(pre Weyland-Yutani)and for a bonus Weyland himself,the alien head they found and took back to the ship,we first saw in the original Alien,which turns out to be a space helmet,the aliens themselves,their attacks in which they go for the mouth and their manor of incubation in the stomach,the alien ship as seen again in the first Alien,and on and on.It is obvious how much new ground there is to mine regarding the Alien franchise and this back story.The franchise has pretty much been run into the ground these past few years and I am so glad Ridley Scott came back triumphantly to tell and sell a new chapter in the Alien history book.It is intriguing and absorbing and I cannot wait until the next one.Just an aside,I would like to see an extended version(which I am sure exists and will be released sometime)of this movie.It would certainly flesh out more of what we saw.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp.There are no extras here.<br />In conclusion Ridley Scott regains the Alien helm once more and breathes new life into this grounded franchise.The actors,the plot and the pace are all there.It's full of questions,some solved and others later posed.But you will eat it all up and be left wanting for more.Highly recommended.parison of Prometheus to the Alien movies before its initial release.But I think it safe to say that this is defintely part of the Alien franchise,a pre-quel if you will,and what a doozy.Like the first one it slowly but surely pulls you in and from then on you cannot help but be a \\"prisoner\\".The film begins with alot of questions and ends with as many.I like Scott's editing and pace.A fine example is the scene where David brings up the alien holographic schematic of our galaxy.The music rises in crescendo and it is a gorgeous moment of discovery(and visuals)by the character,and instead of lingering on and enjoying the moment to its fullest,the schematic suddenly ends(sooner than one would expect)and we're off once again.Scott had alot to tell and obviously didn't want to get bogged down in any one area too long,which enhances the entire dynamic.<br />Along the way we are seeing hints and visual cues of the familiar,from the Alien cannon.The egg shaped cylinders in the \\"head\\"room(not unlike the more rounder versions the later Queens laid),another android(David)which,if you know anything about the Alien franchise,you NEVER trust,the Weyland company name(pre Weyland-Yutani)and for a bonus Weyland himself,the alien head they found and took back to the ship,we first saw in the original Alien,which turns out to be a space helmet,the aliens themselves,their attacks in which they go for the mouth and their manor of incubation in the stomach,the alien ship as seen again in the first Alien,and on and on.It is obvious how much new ground there is to mine regarding the Alien franchise and this back story.The franchise has pretty much been run into the ground these past few years and I am so glad Ridley Scott came back triumphantly to tell and sell a new chapter in the Alien history book.It is intriguing and absorbing and I cannot wait until the next one.Just an aside,I would like to see an extended version(which I am sure exists and will be released sometime)of this movie.It would certainly flesh out more of what we saw.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r and is clear and crisp.There are no extras here.<br />In conclusion Ridley Scott regains the Alien helm once more and breathes new life into this grounded franchise.The actors,the plot and the pace are all there.It's full of questions,some solved and others later posed.But you will eat it all up and be left wanting for more.Highly recommended.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|They are my favorite band and this is a great album. They do it again. This is there best album yet.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|someone wrote this is not a good 3d movie! they really need to check their tv and make sure it is working because on my samsung 3d tv it is unbelievable! i liked the movie before but in 3d it is really explosive! love it!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Ms Rowling can write well. I was involved with her characters by the second page. But what a sad little story she told. When I finished the book, I wanted to read it again and have it end differently, but that would not have been \\"authentic.\\" What ever she puts out next, I'll be in line to read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it! !!!!!!!! I am without a doubt addicted to pinterest! I have found soo many things I want to try :)
B004TSXUWY|4.0|Slow to start and needs u to really read the book with out distractions but a gripping end that gives u opportunity to reflect
B008LY5VHE|1.0|I have not received the DVD that I ordered instead I received a link to watch the movie through my computer. I will not do this  since it will not give you the impact of watching on a large screen. This is a mistake and I have been unable to talk to a live person to correct the problem. Amazon is getting out of touch to handle a change like this so I will wait for my Credit Card bill to contest the charge so I can get somebody's attention. JOS
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|The Uruk-hai Army is a great addition to the much larger and more expensive LEGO Helm's Deep set. On its own though, it's little more than just a small wall and siege weapon with a ton of figures mixed in. I will say it does make up for some of the shortcomings of Helm's Deep. This is mainly because it includes just two figures less than than it's larger cousin.<br /><br />Construction is pretty quick and simple. You build the Uruk-hai and siege weapon first, then the wall section and Rohan minifigures. You get some great pieces, although you will be pretty limited in what you do with them other than building the actual set as instructed. I enjoy the fact that the wall is completely brick built. It's so much better than relying on the large wall panel pieces that dominated older castle sets.<br /><br />I love the figures from the LotR line and all of the ones included here look great. They have detailed printing and tons of accessories. None of these should disappoint fans of the Lord of the Rings and LEGO, so no worries there. I do wish the set came with one less Uruk-hai and an extra Rohan soldier though. The battlements of Helm's Deep are pretty barren when it comes to generic soldiers, and a different mix would give you some extra defenders.<br /><br />Bottom line: Get this set if you have Helm's Deep or are buying them together. On its own, it's probably not worth getting as just a generic battle scene.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Movie is awesome first and foremost. Best Marvel movie to date. The combo pack is cool with both Blu Ray and DVD. All the special features are on the Blu Ray disc, so just remember that. Nice to know I can take this movie anywhere and watch it with any player.
B005FITIGO|3.0|Good acting as you would expect from this cast. But the plot and resolution has no strong resolution and leaves you feeling incomplete and a bit ill at ease. Perhaps that was the intention: to wake people up about the dangerous financial misconduct happening in America.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game because to this day I have not figured out how to get past the 2nd level. This makes the game challenging to me and keeps my mind occupied and relexes fast. I've only played it about 7 or 8 times but will get back to it again soon.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Well... I had originally wanted to buy this book on paper back. I saw how thick it was and originally intended to read it on my travels back to Florida. I figured there was no way it would fit into my carry-on, so I decided to go ahead and invest in a Kindle Fire. I bought the book that night.<br />I have been wanting to read this for ever since I learned of it.<br />I started in earnest on reading it. I had no idea how much I actually was going into it. I wasn't expecting a love story too, so I guess it was really two stories in one.<br />This is also only the second book that made me cry.<br />Overall I was quite impressed being a  Kennedy assassination buff.
B00004RI87|5.0|Just a great group of guys that made music I really dig. Different for me cause I'm just now trying out the Stoner rock genre but very rewarding. Love the vocals and it so fits with the sound of the band. It worked!
B006ZDU7QI|3.0|I was pretty disappointed in the album as a whole. Other than the song we all know and 'Eyes Wide Open', nothing else for me here.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good app to have when u r trying to pass the time because of all the different games on here.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|It's a Muse album. It doesn't have a 'slam dunk' single like the last one ('Uprising'), but it is an engaging album. The production and audio quality might be the best of any of their albums-which is really saying something. A worthy addition to their catalogue.
1451695195|5.0|This is an important book, but perhaps not for the reason(s) you suspect.<br /><br />The most significant thing about this book is not whether the Dr.'s experience is true, but rather the scientific evidence that his neocortex--the part of the brain generally considered responsible for producing NDEs was entirely shut down. The standard explanation for NDEs is that some kind of brain malfunction while the brain is under duress, such as oxygen deprivation or physical trauma, causes people to think they're seeing something, or are somewhere, supernatural, when in fact it's just an illusion.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's case is unique because none of those explanations work. The evidence reveals that his experience could not have had a physical cause. His brain was being monitored minutely, and his neocortex was shut down. So his experience must have a non-physical cause.<br /><br />Hence, his experience (whether it's objectively true or not) provides empirical support for the mind being distinct from the brain. Consciousness as it were, does not require material sub-strata to operate! While this does not prove there is life after death, it greatly opens up the possibility by demonstrating there's a part of us that exists (our mind/soul) even when our physical body is not functioning.<br /><br />This is why the book does not go in-detail about the content of the experience itself. That's not the most profound part (to answer the negative reviews saying it needed more fluff). And additionally, this is what makes the book unique among NDEs, and not susceptible to the casual criticisms and dismissals (to answer the negative reviews from those who haven't read it).<br /><br />Read it. Souls separate from our physical bodies are real. :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Devin
B0086700CM|5.0|Running for your life, jump or slide and quick turns are challenging as it speed up.  Collect coins as you run so that you can buy ways to win awards. Enjoying the challenge.
B00000IQW5|5.0|My sister-in-law requested this DVD as a gift. I haven't seen it myself but she was thrilled with it. Thank you.
B008N1LL42|5.0|A real pick me up action packed movie with quite a few surprises. You'll come away full and satisfied, I will be watching this again.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie!  If you are a fan of Shaun of the Dead, or Hot Fuzz you will enjoy this.  Me being a geek, I really enjoyed the geek humor and jokes.  Not high brow, but a lot of fun!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I really like playing this while sitting around doing nothing reminds me of games at an arcades. its great cause I'm not spending real coins
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I liked this product in the beginning, i thought the color and price were good. but after a month or so, the edges started fraying. it's frayed all around the edges, and doesn't look good, something other people have noticed, which is embarassing to me. i will probably just use a sissors and trime it, but i hope it doesn't keep fraying.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|We all wish we could go back in time if only for a little while .<br /> This book is a page turner but a depth of insight that is about how to live today. I am not a great reader of S King's novels but enjoyed this very much.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|A Monumental Masterpiece for A Debut Album. BOSTON came in the Music world in  1976; to prove that Rock N Roll can be Melodically,Harmoniously, and Magically Beautiful. Brad Delp's wonderful Voice, and Tom Sholz's unique Guitar Riffs and Playing outlines the Power of this Great Rock Band. Every Song is excellent,and this is a Completely \\"Feel Good\\" Album.  A  timeless Classic that will uplift you everytime.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I LOVED this game when it first came out on the PC. so happy to see it comeback on the kindle :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|We have played this game since we purchased the game and we find ourselves playing the game for hours trying to better our scores.  We do enjoy the game and find it quite amusing.<br /><br />Thank you
B003ODIZL6|5.0|it was very nice and helps me write stories. it also lets me find the meaning of different words and sayings
0316143472|5.0|I had just finished reading two serious novels back-to-back. Where do I go when I want to be amused and entertained, and know I will laugh out loud and guffaw and gasp? David Sedaris! This book did not disappoint. From This Old House to Memento Mori to Mrs. Peacock (\\"That's just Keith.\\") Too, too funny. I highly recommend this book. It's one of my favorites of his.
0307591549|1.0|I first heard about The Happiness Advantage on a fundraising special Shawn Achor did for PBS.  He had I think it was seven exercises you could do every day to increase your level of happiness, but since I tuned in late and didn't realize what I was looking at for the first 10 minutes or so, I only had the opportunity to write four of them down.  When I saw that there was a summary of the book, I figured it would be primarily a list and short explanation of these seven steps, and since that was the only thing I wanted, I bought it.<br /><br />Since I knew what I was looking for, I was able to pick out a couple of them, never clearly identified as such, from this summary, but the rest of it was stuff that held no interest whatsoever.  So if you're looking for a summary of the exercises you can do to increase your happiness quotient, this is most definitely not it.  And now I have to go back and buy the book anyway because this was a complete and total waste of my money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was worried that with so many characters the readers have grown close to over the last two books Riordan would have trouble giving them each the attention their fans wanted them to have, but he manages to put most of them in their own spotlight while leaving room for his famous action-packed and heroic scenes. Scenes that echo ancient mythology so well. The Mark of Athena was a joy to read, I eagerly await more work from Riordan's pen.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i think its good but this is like just another temple run.... still is good for a long car ride.
B0053O89KG|5.0|We absolutely love Castle.  We are so excited to see how it will go next season.  How will they put it all together and keep the story going?  They have not disappointed us yet.  Very fun show!!!
B007TK77QE|3.0|A thought provoking,disturbing and often very accurate look into the human condition. The Casual Vacancy explores small town prejudices, presumptions and ego with a view to exposing our own failings. This novel is vastly removed from JK Rowling's previous works and though at times a little tedious is still worth the read.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|Not an album I was close to until I read about and watched a brief video for the 'So DNA' disc. An amazing, immersive experience that I am now obsessed with. I can't wait to explore the rest of this box of treasures.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have used this app for my older 2.2.2 Android phone since April 2012.  Out of nowhere *poof* its just totally gone. I can't install it any more. I suspect that there must be a very large number of people who are wondering what happened to their Kindle app on their phone?<br /><br />If this is an attempt by Amazon to have phone users install their App Store, what a disappointment.  The old standalone app was brilliant, simple and makes it easy to read books even on a tiny 3.2\\" screen.  Why did you have to break this App? Please fix it.
B009WJX10G|1.0|I think they simply tried to save money on this episode. it looked cheap and i agree with the guy above it is a rip off of the chronicle. all i can say is that if they showed this during Halloween i would have dropped the series completely and i have been a avid watcher and die hard fan since season 1 episode 1.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I like Krall's \\"standards\\" but her album \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" has always been the dark-horse in her catalogue in my opinion.  It was a deviation from her \\"norm\\" and it was a brilliant album that received a lot of unnecessary criticism by fans.<br /><br />\\"Glad Rag Doll\\" reminds me a lot of that album.  I wasn't ga-ga over it on the first or second listen, but after five or six lessons I can hear the \\"vision\\" of the work.  For a person who enjoys Krall's less mainstream sounds you will like this album.  It's not as stellar as \\"Girl in the Other Room\\" but it is in the same vein.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app os loaded with levels it is one of the best apps I have ever baught. I would definitly recommend thos to a friend or anyone really. I think this is Disney's best app yet!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Can't stop listening to it over and over again. One of my favorite CD's of the year. Favorite songs: Babel, I will wait, Holland Road, Broken Crown.
B009LZFXDO|5.0|Love this ingenious show! Full of wit, you can never guess what Sherlock noticed or deduced. Watson is okay, prefer work Jude Law has done for this character over Lucy Lu's contributions, but hey, she can only get better, right? Very entertaining show overall, my favorite of all this season's pilots!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read on about the up and down lives of Gideon and Eva! I find myself losing track of time while following them through their days.
B002NXOQF2|1.0|I purchased this book in Kindle format for my dyslexic son. He uses the text-to-speech function to listen on his Kindle. Watership Down had that option greyed out, so he was not able to listen. I have read the book multiple times and know it as a classic. I want my son to be able to enjoy it as well. Unless the text-to-speech is allowed, he will never get to.
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|I must say this one surprised me. Having liked Deadwood, despite the attempt to insert \\"JAYSUS F-ING CHRIST!\\" in every sentence in a western, this one was a welcome diversion from typical, cookie-cutter Hollywood cliche.<br /><br />Awesome scenery.<br />Awesome costumes.<br />Awesome display of period props.<br />Awesome Blu-Ray quality (unlike others).<br /><br />Excellent dialog.<br />Excellent storyline elements.<br />Excellent casting.<br /><br />While there is a hint of anti-christianity, it is nowhere near as vicious as most other tellyvision programming.<br />There is some lesbian elements, but there is heterosexual content enough for those of us still kicking.<br />There is a hint at super-smart black man out-playing all the white men, but just a hint.<br />There is a slight inaccuracy that moonshining was more powerful than political crime, but still a good story.<br />There is a poor Jewish victim, even though most major mafia figures in American history were Jewish men.<br /><br />History is history. Sometimes history can be overlooked to create an entertaining story. This appears to be one of those times.<br /><br />Of this first season,<br /><br />worth the time<br />worth the money<br />very enjoyable for a Hollywood production!<br /><br />Recommended.
B009GED1IY|4.0|We saw this first at the movies and we enjoyed it so much, I purchased it for us to watch at home.  We really thought Alec Baldwin was hilarious and laughed so much throughout the movie that we knew it would be fun to have at home.
B0081BU42O|2.0|I have read everything Mr. Banks has published and this is his worst. Very difficult to read. Confusing, and a weak attempt at being clever. So sad as I have loved his other works.
B0091REZMW|4.0|most games ive tried that were free are no fun. but the mystery manor is pretty good for a freebie!
B008J34466|5.0|I enjoy her Blow Me One Last Kiss.  I've not had much time to sit and listen to the rest of the cd, but I don't doubt that it's wonderful.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|so much fun. and the cutscenes have pretty impressive graphics for a kindle game. I definitely reccomend this game to anyone.
B00902MCVY|5.0|I was a little disappointed after the first time I listened to this album a couple days ago.  It's relatively short, a small chunk taken up by mellow instrumental intros to songs, and the lead guitar work that blew everyone's mind on the first album is sparse.  What the hell, we waited all those years for this?<br /><br />Like every album that grew on me, I gave it another listen, than another, now I can't stop listening to it.  Seriously, I'm listening to it right now as I'm writing this.  Once you accept that it's a different album than it's predecessor, the songs have that rare magic that transport you to an unexplored majestic place.  This album is epic, ambitious, and at times almost too much to take in, but Wintersun pulls it off.<br /><br />The lyrics are a little repetitive, but the music is good enough that I'm willing to forgive Jari for that.<br /><br />If you don't like it at first, give it a few more listens.  You'll be glad you did.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Here's the thing: this show is amazing. To say anything less means you are a terrorist. And Americans hate terrorists. Are you an American? Or a terrorist? The acting is superb, the drama is exhilarating, and the suspense is so thick it can be cut with a knife and served with Thanksgiving dinner. I can't think of a better TV show at this point. Waiting the two days to get this in my mailbox was two days too long. We really need to develop teleportation devices so when you buy this award winning, face melting, life altering show, it can immediately pop itself into your DVD player and play itself. Why are you still reading this review? Buy it now! Only you can prevent the zombie apocalypse.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was very surprised by the twists in this book! Not the typical predictable suspense novel. I enjoyed it and can see why it is on top of the bestseller list.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I WANT ALL OF MY MONEY BACK FOR ALL OF THE ANGRY BIRDS I PAID FOR. BECAUSE THERE ARE AD'S STILL IN THE GAMES. ALSO TO GET AN UPDATE I HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS TO GET IT.... IM SICK OF THIS. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. AND NOT TO MENTION SINCE I UPDATED THIS ANGRY BIRDS I CAN'T GET IT TO WORK. IT KEEPS SHUTTING OFF.ARGGGGGGG
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This series is great! It is an interesting premise about whether a POW was turned into a spy by the Taliban during his 8 years as a prisoner. It has lots of twists and turns that leave you thinking about it well after it's over. Watch it! btw, not suitable for kids.
B00845POUO|5.0|very inspirational movie about how you can do a difference in life. not for the faint of heart very graphic very sad moments in the movie but all inspirational and makes you want to go out and save more orphan kids.
0385535147|2.0|I haven't read a Grisham mystery/thriller in a while and after this, I won't be again anytime soon. Contrived,implausible plot and except for the protagonist,cardboard characters. The first third or so is promising, but it goes totally off the rails when the \\"real story\\" begins to unfold. If you want to read a decent,recent Grisham book try \\"Calico Joe\\".
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This show 'Castle' is the best TV show that they have come out with in a Very Long Time. It gives you the suspense, murder and intrigue and offers some fun as well. The actors do a great job with their parts. Everyone should watch this show at least once. I prefer watching 'Castle' over other shows that they put out for TV.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|New all time favorite book! Can't believe I hadnt read it before now. Such an inspiration to follow your dreams.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Neil Gaiman himself said that people either love it or hate it, I've read both versions, the original and now this preferred edition and loved both of them.<br />The book starts slowly, and progresses bit by bit but, once it's started you go along with the story. Due to the fact that I'm not from USA I might lose sight of some of the more subtle references, but the gods are totally enjoyable and the story is great.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|This is a long book...but, from whatever direction you hit it, it could be much longer, I suppose.  All the high points are there: the childhood sexual abuse, the early days of the band, Tommy, Lifehouse, Moon, Entwhistle, the kiddyporn...but we never really learn much more than we already know.  I was hoping for more about the writing of the songs, the process of recording, the inspiration, but these stories are glossed-over.  Lifehouse is there, but Who's Next gets a fraction of the pages that Psychoderelict or Iron Man have.  Who's Next is a masterpiece, Pete.  You've earned (and still earn) a fortune from that album.  Tommy is there, but there's more about setting up studios and buying boats than Pete's writing and recording of Tommy (Pinball Wizard is mentioned in passing...he was friends with this guy who liked pinball, so he wrote a song about it and it fit in the Tommy story...that's it?).  If you want to hear about the women he slept with (as long he was in America, it seemed to be ok with his wife back in the UK), and there aren't many, that's there.  If you want page after page details about buying houses and setting up his studio equipment, that's there.  But, if you want to know more about Entwhistle and Moon and Roger and the dynamics of the group, there's little to be found.  Just some more Moon stories about jumping out windows, Entwhistle stories about dying with a hooker in Vegas, and Roger stories about his anger issues.  Nothing new.  And, I kept thinking about Pete's song \\"Slit Skirt\\" from the early 1980s with the line \\"Let me tell you some more about myself...\\"  I'm still waiting.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|loved it, but just did update and now gives me a force close message and wont open. have had it for 3 yrs. help
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Battleship was the greatest alien movie that has been made so far. It will definitely never get old. Thank you mom and dad for a great birthday present.
B00846REIS|3.0|I was not as impressed by this book as others in the genre. Too many similarities to overcome right away. However, I decided to read the second book in the series anyway and LOVED the second book. It became its own novel with all of the pieces fitting right into place.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|i love this game. i think the graphics are well executed and the storyline is well written. I really enjoy playing this on my kindle. I will probably start the game all over again once I have conquered it the first time around.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I only wish things were less expensive. $90,000 for one counter is insane! Love the new recipes and items though.
B00466HM28|4.0|The keyboard part of this device works very well, but the pad part could have been better. I did not use this myself but my brother did because I bought it for him.<br /><br />He said that the drumpad signal has a lot of noise and is not very usable. But the keyboard part is perfect. I would have gotten the version without the drumpad but this one was quite a bit cheaper.<br /><br />1 star knocked off for the drumpads.
B008R14YBK|5.0|This has to be the best album of the year. Arguably better than Taylor Swift's 'Red'. And I L.O.V.E. LOVE that album. The fact is the haters hate this album 1: because Bridget's a Disney Channel star. 2: it's such a different sound from all the manufactured plastic crap pop out there. ( yes I said crap most of it is because its ALL dancy and very similar) Now on to the sound of the album. Contrary to the haters the songs do not sound ALL EXACTLY THE SAME! They are very different from each other, just in the same style. LIKE ALL OTHER ALBUMS ON EARTH! An Album has a specific style to it and the songs on said album are going to sound similar, like LIGHTS 'Siberia' any Bjork album and yes even LADY GAGA does this. Also there is very little autotune on this album which may have people think there is a lot becauese so many artists just autotune the crap out of their music, if you think i'm wrong about this album not having much autotune just go watch bridgets live performances. SHE SOUNDS 99% THE SAME LIVE AS THE ALBUM. The album is one of those to take on a road trip with your girls (guys can too i am one) and just jam and have fun all day long. now i say something bad about every album, and in this one i only find two problems. 1: in song 'I Forgot To Laugh' she references Reese's Pieces twice in two seperate verses witch did throw me off, But the song is STILL one of my favorites. 2: the song 'Blonde' is a great song but at times it sounds like Bridget is making fun of herself. I hope this review is helpful and i Know it was long just haters that hate for stupid reasons make me rant a little :)
1603425381|5.0|This is a gorgeous book.  It has great instructions and is beautifully illustrated with what the border stitch will look like.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00866JL96|5.0|Was great! I really liked the book read it twice and bought the movie of course the book was soooooo much better.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The DVD had no cracks or stops to it, when played in my system. it was also neatly packaged that ensured no physical damage to the DVD so i enjoyed watching the movie. Thank you.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its really fun. I finished all the levels and worldsnno prob but I got a new kindle fire cuz my old one broke but now leps world wont download :-( really wish I could play
B007U4DIM6|2.0|As a followup of the First in the series it was less than I had hoped for. If a Number four is made it will not be on my Wish list.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is one of 2012's best films.<br /><br />Director Wes Anderson, famous for his idiosyncratic, ironic, well-acted films [[ASIN:B004LL86QO The Royal Tenenbaums]], [[ASIN:B0016JBCJW The Darjeeling Limited]], and [[ASIN:B003DNN0L2 Fantastic Mr. Fox]], directs a stellar cast (Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances Mcdormand, Tilda Swinton, and Jason Schwartzmann) in this romantic comedy-drama.<br />The two young leads - Jared Gilman, and Kara Hayward, act their mature roles nicely, and the supporting cast are expectedly awesome!<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful and warm and rich, tinted yellow and with splashes of red and brown, and the score is filled with typical Anderson music - folky, using a lot of Mr. Benjamin Britten's excellent music.<br /><br />The story is extremely funny, warm, and poignant, with memorable, typically quirky characters, and some good dramatic scenes.<br />The result is a visually beautiful, well-acted, very funny, way above average, Wes Anderson film.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation!
B008SVFX96|4.0|While the music was not what I expected, I did enjoy listening to the CD.  I have enjoyed Richie's previous CD's and also those of his bandmates - Bon Jovi.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Excellent!  Babel is a fabulous turn after Sigh no More....I can see why it's number one on the charts.  This CD is wonderful from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is nothing I could say that has not already been said about this wonderful book. You should stop reading reviews and go buy it right now. It's amazing and deserves all the acclaim that it is getting. If this book does not win something (Hugo, Nebula, etc...) than someone needs to be sent out to clean.

1616960922|5.0|A review in three parts:<br /><br />First, I loved it! It pulled me in at the very beginning with the idea of writing a soul. It asked the great question, what is a person really made of? Sanderson explores that theme throughout the book and does it so well that it should be a primer for fantasy and sci-fi writers. Characters are not black and white; their motivations are never surface level. Seeing Shie trying out motivations for the Emperor and having to go all the way back to his childhood to discover them was not only clever, but accurate. While much of the book was about objects and their true identity, what they were made to be; it is plain that these were allegories for people as well.<br /><br />Second, the magic system was very classy. The idea of ornate magical stamps changing something's identity was truly original. Having read the author's explanation for how and where he got the idea for the system only makes me more impressed.<br /><br />Third, yes I know it is short; I also knew it was going to be short. It is marketed as a novella and the author even has a word-count on his blog. You knew (or should have known) what you were getting into before you started. There really should not be any complaints though. Sanderson packs more story into a short novella then most authors do in a full sized novel.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Fifty Grey of shades put me on the edge. Why would a person continued to accept the physical pain and get turned on sexual. You can feel the pain that was inflicted and get hostile on Grey and at the same time with the sexual moment you actually get turned on. I call Grey Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Even though I knew the ending it was like reading a good mystery of events leading to the conclusion. I do not think he gave away anything the enemy did not already know about how the seals work.  It was just a good insight to how Owens viewed his chosen career. I do hate that his identity was leaked as the people we differ with today are back stabbers and this means always looking over his shoulder.  Good read!

No,it isn't Gone With The Wind but I is a \\"pull you in with the first line,grab your heart,pulse racing,stomach in your throat,sobbing,laughing,white knuckle,joy to read. The roller-coaster ride you take and the twists and turns along the way make for an addictive good time. Imagine a world that is decimated and only a chosen few have survived. Their survival is almost worse in some ways than what fate could have dealt. These strong survivors must overcome the challenges to live,and make the best of what they have. The rules are strict, the punishment tough, but they have created an almost normal world somehow. I am now off to buy the 6th installment to find out how the world ended and began again.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is one of my favorite hip-hop albums of the year. Great production, lyrics that vary from playful to profound and a range of vibes results in a track for most every mood or disposition. And since they're self-produced, you can feel good about supporting the little guy.

B0074V33MK|5.0|A superb insight into the little discussed plight of British POW's in the WW2 Pacific theater. My great uncle died one month before the Japanese surrender in the very POW camp mentioned in this account.
B008BM9L72|4.0|First book of a trilogy, book initially good but becomes repetitive and after the first 3 chapters you pretty much know the outcome, it really is bad boy falls in love with good girl, bad boy comes good and they live happily ever after, with sex , kinky sex. The story could have developed depth with some thought but it is on the level of a TV soap opera. Nice easy read
B008NEMPTO|5.0|This movie ruled.  The 3D is some of the best I've seen (including Prometheus and Avengers.)  If you're going into this expecting a whole lot of serious business, you're probably watching the wrong movie.

B009DZDJU6|5.0|This movie was quite well executed. Most of the negatives are from people who read the book and presumed it would be magically transformed into a movie on a one-to-one basis. The British have a word for such notions: Poppycock!  I am a big fan of co-star Dominic Cooper, who plays the son of Saddam Hussein in the movie THE DEVIL'S OWN (also highly recommended by yours truly!). He is a great actor and lends much to this movie as you will no doubt see. If you are a fan of HORROR and a fan of vampire movies, you will like this. If you have read the book and are able to divest yourself from loyalty to that work and view this as a stand-alone piece, you will admit that it is a roller-coaster ride of a great movie. It is, in the end, also a great BUDDY movie and love story. It is a patriotic story of a man who became a hero, who championed the cause of freedom and liberty.<br /><br />The concept of a martial arts trained Lincoln, wielding his axe against blood-sucking monsters from hell is pretty unique. (Side note: I see there is already an Abe Lincoln Vs. Zombies movie out! Let's not get carried away! What's next: Washington Against Werewolves???)<br /><br />There are some extremely intense moments. Some horrifying moments. Some great fight sequences and a lot of gore (though nothing too harsh or just plain disgusting).<br /><br />Now, some belittle the movie as being historically inaccurate. I am no history major, but I am a student of both politics and war, and I did not see any glaring inaccuracies. Considering that this is not a History Channel documentary, I cannot fault the director for making \\"adjustments\\" to suit this work of fantasy/fiction. Good lord people. It's a vampire movie. It CANNOT, by that definition, be historically accurate. Clue: Vampires are not real. Sorry. I hope that didn't make people not want to see the movie. LOL!  Professional wrestling is not real either. 8-) FYI.<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln was all about freedom, liberty and the ability of men to think for themselves. I therefore leave you with this: Go pop up the corn, get some chips and dip, grab an ice cold beverage (I prefer Pepsi!) and  E N J O Y  this very creative, spectacularly made movie experience. Don't forget the Milk Duds and Snickers!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Thanks for reading my review.

B002APU580|5.0|Kiera Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen give absolutely exquisite performances! This is one of my favorite movies! If you're like me, a hopeless romantic,you won't be disappointed!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I won't recount the plot. If you're here, you're probably well familiar with that. I was along for the ride, enjoying much of it, though not as much as the original, and then we get to the ***SPOILER AHEAD** possible murder of the evil stepbrother, which everyone, including the cop investigating it, thinks is ho-hum, well-deserved, moving-right-along, nothing-to-see-here-folks. With the exception of our female protagonist who thinks it's a \\"gift\\". Yes, you read right, a \\"gift\\" from her paramour. I was HORRIFIED. \\"Who ARE these people???\\" I wondered. I started reading a passionate and erotic romance about two people who are damaged and difficult (as are we all to some degree)and was heartened when they seemed to be learning to trust each other (growth! character development! yay!) and then comes the cliffhanger, where it turns out they both may in fact be sociopaths. Talk about a damper on one's libido.<br /><br />The other issue I had with this book was the transformation of Corinne into some evil, manipulative witch. It would have been so much more interesting to explore the challenge to their relationship Corinne might pose as someone who was - as she was described in Bared to You - the antithesis of Eva, because of her poise, calm and serene presence.  In this installment, Corinne was reduced to some caricature of a villainess. Must we hate EVERYONE who poses a threat to their relationship?? That device feels a little sophomoric to me. Perhaps having us feel somewhat conflicted about Corinne might have been more fascinating. And through that, we might have learned something more about exactly what draws and binds Gideon to Eva, other than the fact that they have great sex and are equally effed up.<br /><br />But having said all that, the sex scenes delivered the goods, which, let's face it, can save even the silliest plot points in romantic erotica. I'm on the fence about whether I'll read the third. But, on another high note, I highly recommend Seven Years to Sin, which thankfully is one self-contained book, apparently the inspiration for the Crossfire series.n, which thankfully is one self-contained book, apparently the inspiration for the Crossfire series.

This DVD is part of IP man film series and I have watched all three and was not disappointed with the fight scenes. I think showing the developing Bruce Lee at the end was a nice touch. I grow up watching Bruce Lee films and because of Bruce I am still a martial arts fan today. I recommend this film to those who enjoy a good martial arts film.

0307592731|5.0|The world is a better place because of Cheryl. Her story has made each of us more human.<br /><br />After watching a beautiful video of the Pacific Crest Trail on PBS, I came upon this book by accident and was immediately awestruck. This is a personal memoir, a mental journey towards acceptance and transcendence, interwoven with a grueling physical journey through 1100-mile exotic wilderness.<br /><br />Attempts to describe the book inevitably diminish and trivialize. I cannot impart what David by Michelangelo is. The experience is uniquely mine and you have to go there to experience it yourself. Oprah Winfrey called the book \\"inspirational\\". But I think it oversimplifies. The author herself says if there is one word to describe the book, it's \\"acceptance\\". But that leaves out an important word: transcendence. Acceptance of the loss and the transcendence over it, is what weaves together her story.<br /><br />Some readers are disappointed that her journey didn't end with big revelations in bullet-points. It rather ended with anti-climatic complex emotion of \\"healing\\": relief, anger, a sense of permanency in loss, happiness and sadness. Her authentic style is unmistakable: the real meaning of her journey was not revealed to her for years to come. The end of her journey was the beginning of her new life. She met her future husband nine days later on the Bridge of Gods. She settled in the new state. Years later, her future children would sit on the same white bench where she had sit slurping ice-cream, listening to mom's story of hiking the wilderness alone.<br /><br />Since finishing the book, I have been avidly reading her anthology \\"Tiny Beautiful Things\\", and her many interviews as a writer. Through her \\"unprecedented\\" honesty and openness, I pieced together her life story with details as minute as the outstanding student loan balance. The process blurs her individual writings, but brings forth her life story as an art form in my mind. Cheryl's life has been carvedby unpredictable merciless torrents, but also sculptured and shaped by her unrelenting drive to make sense and make something out of her dealt hand. Her literary work is the window to peek into her life as art, and to touch her better self.<br /><br />Being of the same age as the author, tracing her story naturally made me contemplate and compare my own formative years of the 20s and family losses, and reflect upon friends who suffered immense tragedy with a new life-long reality to cope. Many of us have had unbelievably privileged and sheltered lives. Others are not as fortunate (see \\"Tiny\\"). But we are all united in that we all have our own metaphorical PCT to trek, and the opportunity to climb the staircase of self-transcendence. As Cheryl put it, neither exciting life nor tragic life is art. Transcendence is. She calls upon us to make our life an art.<br /><br />Our world today does not need yet another shiny tablet, or faster stock/bond trades and GDP growth detached from the reality. Nor do we need a glib leverage-buyout-specialist-turned-presidential-candidate, who would demand his pound of flesh, and is as principled as a weather vane. The world needs you, the modern day art benefactors, and artists like Cheryl to make us grounded as human. Steve Almond eloquently wrote in his introduction to \\"Tiny\\": \\"Late-model capitalism is working overtime to keep us focused on products, not people. And the ultimate dwindling resource in our human arrangement is not oil or precious commodities, but mercy.\\"  Cheryl's literary art is what counter-balances our modern empty and soulless pursuit of growth and technology breakthrough.<br /><br />Cheryl's work would expand a reader's perspective on the vicissitude of life. For older readers, it allows them to taste their life a second time. For young readers, it offers the rare gift of traveling to the future to reflect, and then come back to re-examine the unquestioned assumptions about life, and live it differently.k to re-examine the unquestioned assumptions about life, and live it differently.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|First of all, this is a beautifully written book. Whether you like the story or not, the book itself is GREAT and I'd personally like to read more from this author because I enjoyed the writing style so much. My book club at school had chosen Perks as our first book of the year so although that is the main reason I bought it, I had been wanting to read it for awhile now and figured I would purchase on my kindle. As I stated before, the book is written very well, as I could clearly picture each scene in my head and really get an honest sense of what the characters were feeling. I will say though, as much as I enjoyed the story, it had a much darker feel surrounding it than I had anticipated it to so younger readers should proceed with caution as there are frequent mentions of drugs, alcohol, and sex. There are also frequent uses of swear words. However, I thoroughly recommend this book :-)

0307346617|5.0|This is not your common zombie book, it is not your common book! It is written like a mock documentary, which is recording the survivor of War War Z, hence the title: The Oral History of World War Z.<br /><br />The zombie (and war against zombie) is viewed from several genuine angle. Some interviewee plays key role in World War Z itself, while some are just victims or just spectators.<br /><br />Since it is written as an interview, it is quite personal. You might sympathize some characters, while loathe others.<br /><br />The genius of the writer lies within his way in describing many aspects of the war from personal views of the interviewee. From this piece and bits, we can start to construct the whole event of the war.<br /><br />What makes it truly remarkable is the fact that this book is not about zombie after all! Zombie war is just a pretext the greater issue: human ignorance, greed, heroism, global warming, and international politics. We can see this book as a satire of our real and present world!<br /><br />Final verdict: only one word. Wow! Mr. Brooks must have done a very intensive research to come out with this book. Everything looks so real, the international politics, war tactics, mass behavior, everything.<br /><br />This is one book that really effects me. It makes me think again about the future of mankind, for better or worst. Can we really survive as a species, given our trait of ignorance?

B0079XPUOW|4.0|When I picked up Redshirts I was expecting a parody/deconstruction of the much-beloved, much-maligned Star Trek formula. Being familiar with Scalzi's work on the web, I also expected it to be engaging, clever, and funny.<br /><br />I got all that, of course.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was for Redshirts to be poignant, emotionally resonant, and deeply satisfying. Scalzi presents not only the silly sci-fi and narrative tropes of Trek that we all love to poke fun at-- chief among them the OSHA's nightmare of a work environment for the eponymous red-shirts-- but also the well-rounded people and interpersonal themes that have drawn so many to Trek's setting and characters.<br /><br />I picked up the Audible version to listen to while doing tedious and repetitive work. The narration by Wil Wheaton is masterfully done to the point that it would have been criminal to give the job to anyone else. Wheaton's voice hits just the right tones and attitudes. There's a particular scene in which a character is drunk, and I had to rewind and re-listen because Wheaton's drunk-voice was so funny.<br /><br />You don't even have to be a fan of Trek to enjoy this book-- anyone even passing familiar with the sci-fi genre could roll through this story and come out the other side feeling not only entertained, but uplifted. It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book this much. Thank you, Mr. Scalzi.
B005EGXM7I|4.0|When picking up a series like Pretty Little Liars you have some expectations, you're hoping to be entertained but you aren't expecting great literature.<br /><br />Well Pretty Little Liars books 1-4 was exactly what I expected, fun, twists and turns, some resolutions but more questions arise as the books progress and some over the top scenes. I got all that and had a good time reading the books.<br /><br />I liked the liars, I liked the fact that their secrets meant a lot to them, but most of them weren't really life threatening and that's as it should be. I liked that they all had a bit of personal growth! I even felt a bit for A and As reasons for enacting revenge. At the end of book four we find out who A was and why A wanted revenge so badly, but as with all serials that wasn't the end.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|As you read through the reviews of DKR here on Amazon, one thing that will immediately strike the dispassionate buyer is how many reviews will compare \\"Rises' unflatteringly to its predecessor in the trilogy, the Dark Knight. There's a completely irrational and almost obssessive need by the fan community to exalt the qualities of \\"Dark Knight\\" to something resembling mythical proportions. This tendency was also evident among many professional movie critics.<br /><br />To a degree, the strong emotional connection of general and fan audiences to Dark Knight is understandable. As Heath Ledger's last completed film, Dark Knight stands out for his incredibly engaging performance. In the Dark Knight, Ledger disappears into a role and simply mesmerizes on screen, in a way that few actors ever do.<br /><br />And while Dark Knight is legitimately hailed as simply one of the best movies ever created period, rather than merely a superb 'superhero' film, the unfortunate fact is that the esteem with which the movie is held is out of all proprotion to its actual achievements. Yes, Dark Knight is that good, but it is also flawed in some very important ways, and what's more, Dark Knight Rises is a superior entertainment in every way that really matters. But few viewers will ever admit it, because to do so would almost feel like a betrayal of their devotion to the former film. Allow me to explain.<br /><br />As a film, Dark Knight suffers from three major (and one minor but significant) flaws. In the first place, careful viewers will note that, the plot of DK doesn't quite stand up to close scrutiny. There are swathes of the film where the Joker's machinations strike at first as brilliant, till you begin to consider the sequence of events and realize, they don't quite make complete sense. Why precisely police officers behave the way they do in connection with the threats to the hospital or precisely how Joker is able to anticipate certain things that seem completely unconnected to his actions never quite makes sense, but these are minor boggles that don't quite undermine enjoyment of the film. More problematic is the reversal of Harvey Dent from hero to villain. While the character makes a similarly villainous transformation in the comics, in the film he's presented as an ernest and genuinely benevolent fellow who somehow manages to fall so far as to threaten children... He does this while letting the Joker, who is really the person responsible for his grief, survive when he has an opportunity to kill him. But the really troublesome part of Dark Knight and the major reason that film will never achieve the heights for me that others claim, is that in the DK, Batman is the least interesting character in the movie. As if everyone is oblivious of the fact that this is a problem, DK suffers because Bruce Wayne is overshadowed and nearly marginalized by his villains!<br /><br />Which brings me at last, to the Dark Knight Rises. In Rises, not only is the plot immaculate and completelely logical in every respect, not only do the characters behave in a manner that never strains credibility, but at last, Batman is again the most interesting character in his own film. As a movie watching experience, Rises is leagues more entertaining that the DK, (which was occasionally slow and even a little boring in parts, the minor flaw I mentioned), with set pieces that compel and stakes so high that the movie feels less like a film in places and more like an honest chronicle of something happening in a very recognizable part of the world. The cast is superb with amazing performances by Tom Hardy as Bane and Ann Hathaway as Selina Kyle. The standout however is Sir Michael Caine who is so amazingly good that I challenge anyone to watch his performance and not be moved every time he's on screen. In Rises, Batman goes through a true arc, one in which he overcomes his arrogance to find the strength to face his greatest challenge. Executed with style, aplomb and just theright dose of speed, Rises is an eminently more watchable film because it has more going on, has more interesting characters involved, revolves around incredible stakes, and makes Batman the most compelling figure of his universe.<br /><br />To be sure, it's not a perfect film. Michael Caine is absent for too long a stretch and the film makers missed an opportunity to seal the ending with an even more compelling emotional cap, but for me, even those sins are less glaring than the flaws of Dark Knight. Both films are among the best movies ever made however, and both deserve your time!
0525958002|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book and John Taylor did not disappoint. His is a riveting tale.<br />John begins at the beginning...his childhood in Birmingham and his upbringing as an only child of loving parents. By his own account, his childhood was normal and he was a happy little boy. He meets Nick Rhodes at 13 and the rest, as they say, is history. A fascinating history of concert-going, glamming it up, dreams of a band and stardom, great anecdotes. John's dry and self-deprecating British humor remains intact as he recounts his teenage years.<br />Duran's beginnings are extremely interesting and their singular vision and lofty goals amazing. Getting an inside view of Duranmania and the fallout that ensued was sobering, no pun intended. This was a band that always appeared to be having the time of their lives, smiling at us from exotic locales, sashaying about in Antony Price suits, exuding a joie de vivre.<br />John writes frankly and honestly about his substance abuse, which began out of loneliness and spiraled out of control until he entered rehab. I had no idea the depths of his illness. His recovery and triumphant return to life, love, and Duran Duran are recounted here with grace, humor, and honesty. He is self-aware, humble, and grateful. Sober, he faced the loss of both parents and his recollections are extremely touching and poignant. Sober, he also met the love of his life and his happiness is palpable.<br />I was very impressed that John dished the dirt, as it were, only on himself. He made it very clear he would not air Duran's dirty laundry, dish on any of his bandmates, nor go into reasons surrounding Andy Taylor's second departure from the band. Andy has written his own book and John seems content to let him tell his story. In our \\"let it all hang out\\" culture, his stance is honorable and admirable.<br />John is an extremely talented writer and I felt like I was sitting in a cozy living room with him, listening to him chat. I was sad to turn the finalpage but well chuffed, as he might say, that he has come out the other side, wiser, happier, and authentic as all get out.

B007THA4FI|5.0|It's true that this book is NOT Harry Potter and if that's the world you're looking for then you will be sadly disappointed. I must admit that I wasn't immediately hooked but if you keep reading beyond the Kindle sample, the book becomes hard to put down.  The characters are very human and realistic, the story is compelling, and the end will trigger many feels.<br /><br />If you live in a fantasy land where people don't swear, teenagers don't have/think about sex, etc., then don't read this book as it will leave you scandalized.  It's also not aimed at kids.  For those complaining that it's too adult for eight year olds, try actually previewing the book before you hand it to your children.  Rowling has been up front that she wrote this for adults.  I hope she continues to write more adult fiction.

Prepare to be transported into a world of unknown adventure and pure adrenalin rush. Reading right through the night and forgetting to stop for breakfast is the norm when I read a Tom Clancy book.

B00156ZWV0|5.0|I read over the reviews concerning this work and I do give it 5 stars because it deserves it.  I don't think VW was a poplar composer back in the 70's but I liked him alot.  I bought several recordins while I was in college and was always amazed at how \\"English\\" his music sounded.  I love it so much.  As far as these recordings, I am happy they are available.  There will be no more Dame Janet Baker, John Shirley-Quirk.  The two songs that Ursula Vaughn Williams are exquisite.  Never heard them before buying this set.  Not all works had librettos due to copyrights issues so you will need to buy biographies to get this. I still have vinyl recordings which contain the words so I will hold on to them.  It is too bad that EMI did not think enough of the customer to at least place the texts on one disc to be printed out by the purchaser but I guess that had something to do with their financial issues going on at the time of this and other boxed releases.  I am glad to have this.

I loved it. All the characters were rounded out, the main story flowed even though it was made up of lots of threads that would all tie up at the end. It may not be Harry Potter but then it was never meant to be, nor is it a children's story. I would definitely recommend it as a damned good read! A cup of cocoa, a rainy day, a warm fire...and A Casual Vacancy. Yep, it's a winner.<br />Valda Joy Anderson NZ
B007GCY8FS|2.0|While readable in typical Lee Child manner , it is so like his other more recent Jack Reacher books that it hardly seemed with reading. Time for some variety.

B009MO5E10|2.0|When I first saw trailers for this movie I was thinking, \\"Why do I want to see a movie about bike messengers?\\" Then I saw some reviews which were for the most part, positive. So what the hell? Well, I should have stuck with my initial instincts.<br /><br />Here's the deal. In New York City, the town is flush with in-person messenger services and the quickest delivery method is via bicycle. Evidently, the small companies are very competitive. One such company has law school grad Wilee (as in coyote) employed. He is arguably the fastest and most dependable. As he says numerous times it is because he doesn't use bikes with gears or get this...brakes! More on that in a minute. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his all-in earnest way, Wilee is given an assignment to carry a ticket used by Chinese money launderers given to him by the 23 year old roommate (Jamie Chung) of his girlfriend (Dania Ramirez). It's worth about $50K and is to be exchanged for her 4 year old son who is being smuggled into the city from China.<br /><br />A crooked cop played with relish by Michael Shannon has an unusual name, Bob Monday as opposed to Joe Friday. Get it? Bob is up to his eyeballs in debt to Chinese gangsters for his gambling losses playing what appears to be pai gow. He's tipped off about the \\"laundry\\" ticket which is as good as cash. So the rest of the film is him chasing Wilee after Wilee refuses to give up the ticket.<br /><br />Back to the no brakes thing. Wilee uses this exclamation seemingly dozens of times throughout the movie which is why it drove me crazy. In an early scene as he whizzes in and out of traffic, he skids his back wheel into a controlled slide. Clearly the bike has a form of braking. An example of which was on all those bikes people of a certain age will remember. And yes, some bikes still have them today*. He uses it throughout the chase scenes. He doesn't have the caliper style brakes which are used by the other messengers, but you know, it's still a brake! In one scene his girlfriend goes flying over the handlebars when she has to brake suddenly. Seeing this Wilee exclaims, \\"That's why I don't use brakes.\\" It's hard for me to believe that profession bike messengers don't understand the concept of what will happen at high speed when you ONLY apply the front brake. I only rant about this brake thing because it is used throughout the film. Wilee doesn't use brakes. Bullspit.<br /><br />Director David Koepp also uses the flashback concept which takes us back to see the set up and add some explanation. It all just seemed unnecessary, especially when we're just talking about 1 day. I also had a hard time understanding why an injured, beaten, confused and demoralized Wilee wouldn't just hop in a cab and take the ticket to its destination if it was so important.<br /><br />One more rant and I promise I'll stop. One of the reviews I read spoke of \\"shards\\" of glass flying around after the bike messengers collides with a taxi. Sure enough, you can see them in the scene, coming from the vehicle. Well, cars use safety glass or laminated glass on their windows. And yes, they can be dangerous when broken. But they won't unloose \\"shards\\" of glass. That's why the vehicles have that type of glass. On a positive note, many of the bike tricks are pretty cool. I especially liked one in an impound lot where Wilee jumps his bike all over the place. Should be a good candidate for the next \\"X-games\\" contest. The acting is fine. After all, they didn't conceive or write this ridiculous script. And certainly, Oscar nominee Michael Shannon hams it up for all he's worth.<br /><br />*I suspect Wilee is using what is known as a fixed gear bike. Technically there are no traditional brakes. In practice, the rider locks the rear wheel by resisting the forward motion of the pedals and crank. This type of bike does not coast. Still, it brakes. The filmmakers give the illusion of an out of control rider with no way to stop.n one scene his girlfriend goes flying over the handlebars when she has to brake suddenly.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|The long anticipated animated telling of Frank Miller's masterpiece is worth the wait.  I wish that we did not have to wait so long for the second part and I wish that Frank Miller had participated in its creation.  Either way a BIG THANK YOU goes out to both Frank Millar for the vision and then to Bruce Timm for helping create the animated BATMAN that we all have grown to love.

B008NABUU8|5.0|for days, I couldn't stop playing. sure, it takes a sec it load, but every puzzle is fun. I beat the whole game and only have about 5 bridges to improve enought for trucks to cross. got it free, but would have gladly paid for it. Gladly give 5 stars.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|It was just ok. I grew up listening to -and loving - every song in this movie (in the 80's, when they came out!), and that was why I wanted to see it. I wanted to like it more than I did. I was surprised at Tom Cruise actually being a pretty good singer, but his acting in this was AWFUL. He moved like he was very uncomfortable with every single move. Totally stupid plot, but that's fine, to be expected - it was made for the love of the songs, not the plot! Drew (Diego) was really good, probably the best as far as singing goes in the film. Glad I watched it, but not something I'll ever want to watch again. *sigh*
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is a cute and fun game for all hello kitty lovers but the character you start off playing the game with is not hello kitty herself you have to earn points to get her It may take awhile but you can obtain enough points to get her for free nevertheless it is still an adorable and fun game and I would recommend it for all ages

0446580848|5.0|Never been disappointed with any of Nelson DeMille's past works, that trend continues with this new novel.  \\"Panther\\" brings together DeMille's strongest characters John Corey and Paul Brenner.  That alone made the book a must read for me.  If you are a DeMille fan, you should thoroughly enjoy this one.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi is a wonderful adventure that takes on deeper and deeper meaning the further you get into the story.  At times it felt like Hemingway and I found myself assigning new meanings to each of the objects and characters.  The story was never slow and always enjoyable through to the end.  I would recommend it to any adventurous reader.
0399157565|5.0|As an old fan of Patricia Cornwell (I have read ALL of her books!) I was eager to get my hands on this recent edition.  Although I have enjoyed each in their own way, I am (as many others seem to be:) a huge fan of Scarpetta back in her \\"Richmond days\\".  After reading the previous book, Red Mist, I was excited that the style and tone of the book was almost a kick back to those that drew me to them in the first place.  So I loved that it was not only still there in The Bone Bed but there are even a few hints back to the \\"old days\\".  LOVED this newest book by Cornwell!  Highly recommend!!  I'm even planning it for my next book club selection:)
B008MM9630|3.0|This is a fun game with cute graphics and easy game play. You are assigned tasks to complete on your farm that get you rewards like coins and points so you can buy more items for your farm. The problem is eventually you start getting tasks that require diamonds which you must buy with real money. You earn diamonds every now and then but not enough to complete the tasks. For example right now I'm on a task that requires me to buy an item that costs 120 diamonds. It would take me at least a month to earn that many diamonds. I don't appreciate being forced to spend my real money if I want to keep playing the game. I have no intention of buying a single diamond so I guess eventually I'll have to choice but to stop playing the game.

1451620829|4.0|So finally we have it, original KISS drummer Peter Criss's autobiography that he's been talking about since what seems like decades now. I used to kid around with people that it was Peter's Chinese Democracy, but even that came out four years before his autobiography did. KISS fans are attached to the original members and the personas they portrayed, but when I was a kid I wanted to be Peter Criss. He was the reason I wanted to play drums and when me and my friends put on the KISS makeup for Halloween I was Peter. You cannot deny that Peter was an original member and was a part of what made KISS and what made the band special, his jazzy drumming style, his voice; he was an important part of what initially made KISS. I was glad to see that his book was finally released, Gene's and Ace's books are good reads but you get a sense that just scratch the surface (Gene's first book is largely about himself, his second business and Ace's book he seems to have forgotten things and skims through years towards the second half). Peter Crisscuola I knew would be honest to write it all down, the good, the bad, the madness and he's not shy about his drug addictions, his near suicide in 1994, depression, battles with cancer, even his band members (I think this may be the final nail on the coffin for any fans that still had hopes of seeing the original four reunite once more).<br /><br />The first chapter already sets into the some of the madness in Criss' life. The book starts in 1994 when an earthquake destroyed everything he owned and he was about to pull the trigger on his life. It's a rather dark chapter to start the book with but it's good in that it makes you want to read the book and find out all you can. I loved the part about recording Destroyer and how demanding producer Bob Ezrin was, out of all the books that have come out on the band Peter goes into the details and things that aren't as talked about. He sheds insight on the money he made, how much money KISS made. Peter is very vocal and I was captivated to read his thoughts from about 1978-80 when he was about to leave the band and it was clear that they were not longer a unit (he wasn't fond of Love Gun either turns out). He was against doing the KISS Meets The Phantom of The Park '78 made for TV movie and the way he recalls it he was really direct about it too and thought it wasn't KISS anymore and hated doing it. Same with the Dynasty album in 1979 with \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" going disco even though he didn't play on that album except for his one contribution. I think he sums it up best when he said \\"To me KISS was a Rock and Roll band and we had become a kiddies band, a circus and it became about the merchandise and not the music, I was in for the music from the beginning man\\". I think that echoes some of the KISS Army's feelings too.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I didn't know or had only read about but without any real insight. His wives, his going to basically an asylum, his near comeback to KISS in 1980, suicide attempt and so on. It's definitely a must read for a fan. I loved reading about Peter's childhood and growing up, playing clubs before KISS, his attempt at a solo career, the reunion with KISS up until now. It's all covered make no mistake. Sometimes it's easy to see how fragile and emotional Peter could be, deep down the cat is sensitive. Yet reading his book and all the stories he tells he really was the original Tommy Lee in a sense, there's a lot of immature fun and stuff that will make you go \\"what?\\". There's swear words throughout but then again its rock and roll and sometimes it can be offensive.<br /><br />The most interesting parts of the book may very well be the dirt on Gene, Paul and Ace. I don't think anyone would be surprised by what Peter had to say on Gene. Ace's is a bit more surprising and I'm sure he wouldn't be happy to know some of the things that were included about his subject in the book even though they're more goofy than anything else. The worst though, is definitely Paul and Peter tells it all, how he used to see shrinks and talk to them on the phone every day, his sexuality, certain physical aspects and things that he did (particularly funny and exaggerated during the KISS/Aerosmith tour). What made me respect Peter's decision to make this book was that he intended to reveal all the behind the scenes about KISS and he had no problem telling this as they were. He gives credit where credit is due as he talks a lot about Bill Aucoin and Sean Delaney, the tour guys and acknowledges whoever did what. To sum it up at one given point he says that Gene and Paul like to take credit for certain things while it was others who came up with the ideas, or mess with \\"KISStory\\" as he puts it. He's utterly honest about touring, his wives, the sex, drugs and all the crazy things he did. He tells all about growing up, his family and personal things really. Sometimes you don't even want to know some of these stories in the book because it's plain filthy and immature, but this is Rock and Roll and Criss'book is a wild ride.<br /><br />I love how he doesn't hide his feelings on KISS, the band members, producers or anyone else. When he talks about why he quit the band you understand it more, why he decided to leave and the events that pushed him to do it. His feelings about KISS now are clear as well and he really doesn't like Tommy Thayer. He's vocal about decisions that were made and what some band members did and tells it all like it was. Ace's book was a good read but Peter's goes deeper and offers insight and his personal feelings and there is a lot of \\"dirt\\" so to speak. The book is not just about KISS, there's a lot about Peter himself. His personality and how he is, his solo career and the bands he played with, the near suicide and more recently his breast cancer battle and its all things that would of interest to a KISS fan and it's all in this book.<br /><br />Peter's book was well put together and comes across as honest and very readable. I know Peter was known for exaggerating sometimes and crying wolf but even he acknowledges that, and he doesn't try to make himself or anyone come off as angels or any better than anyone else. Makeup to Breakup is a great read for anyone who is or was a KISS fan, Criss'book does the best job of telling it like it really was and goes into things that other KISS books do not which would make it required reading for the die-hard. I have a lot of admiration for Criss putting this book out slamming himself, his bandmates, the decisions they made. An entertaining book and a solid read, it delivers and informs certainly answered some questions I had and others I didn't have. 4/5.hing else.

B006CHML4I|1.0|It's a very nice looking watch, the band is quite comfortable, and the self-winding mechanism was what persuaded me to order it. But after a week of following the directions every day for setting the day and date (do it in the morning, etc.), they still keep flipping over to the next day and date prematurely. If you don't mind a watch that shows the wrong day of the week and the wrong numerical date at least half of every day, order this one.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon's good customer service has enabled me to return the watch for a full refund. Thanks for that, Amazon.
B000UZQI0Q|4.0|This is the second book in the Mistborn trilogy. If you haven't read the first, go read [[ASIN:B002GYI9C4 Mistborn: The Final Empire (Mistborn, Book 1)]] first. I'll avoid talking directly about the plot of the book, but it suffices to say that if you enjoyed The Final Empire, you will like The Well of Ascension too. The first book was a better stand-alone novel than the sequel. Once you finish this book you will probably want to dive straight into [[ASIN:0765356147 The Hero of Ages: Book Three of Mistborn]].<br /><br />I read all three books on my Kindle and I can assure other Kindle users that the books are formatted well and don't seem to suffer from any bizarre errors. The Kindle \\"chapter breaks\\" correspond to the \\"books\\" inside of each novel, so you can't jump between chapters as easily as you might like. I never felt a need to flip back and forth in this book --- although I can see a few reasons some might --- and so I had no problems with that formatting choice.<br /><br />All in all, if you enjoy Brandon Sanderson's world-building and liked the first novel in this series, you should continue reading. Although the ideas introduced in The Well of Ascension don't come across as quite so novel as they did in the first book, you will enjoy further exploration into the world of Vin, Elend, and Sazed. The story arc carried across the final two books is rewarding and surprising --- especially the end of the second book.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but not quite as good as the first.
B0065FFMR0|5.0|This show is amazing, the story line is great, and after watching an episode it makes you want more and more! I highly recommend this to any and all horror fans!
0345803493|5.0|This took a lil bit longer than the others to get here but it was worth the wait...so much happend in this book.. ordered # 3 before I was half way done wit this one which was 2 days after it arrived :-)
B0011WL8MK|5.0|A truly great film. Making Hitler an object of ridicule and derision in the wonderful Lubitsch style, right at the start of the war. Carole Lombard's best film (sadly, her last) since her earlier social satires, Nothing Sacred and My Man Godfrey. Jack Benny's best film by far. A wonder. Hilarious and frightening. Lubitsch's insight into human behavior is amazing.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|thumbs up,loved it,can't wait for another one to come out,i hope iron man 3 is as good as this one
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I bought this cd after listening to her music on a commerical. I can honestly say I really enjoyed all the music on this CD. Not what i was expecting but glad I purchased.
B002VISN9E|5.0|Great Dahl book, in the spirit of BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I can identify in many ways with Matilda (though not her special powers or parents).
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I haven't made it through all of the book but it definitely seems like a teen focused book!  I regret paying 7.99 for this book but will reserve judgement until finished.  Maybe I got on the wrong Amazon thread?
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Many books in this genre either start out well but fail to deliver or drag out after the most obvious end has already been delivered. In contrast this book is exactly right, lots of unanswered questions that drags you in and a great ending (that is a complete surprise), but without a lot of end fluff. Highly recommended as a suspense novel or as fiction with a taste of science.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game was a great throwback to SNES style RPG games. This took me about 20 hours to complete and the only complaint I have is that some of the translation is a little bit off, though never so off that you can't understand what is happening. (It's such a non-issue that I didn't even knock a star off of the score)<br /><br />One nice feature is that once you complete the main story of the game you can continue on. There are several secret dungeons and even an option for New Game +. (That allows you to begin a new game and retain all your levels, items and money from your previous playthrough)<br /><br />The only other bad thing I can think of is that this game doesn't support Amazon Game Circle. I would really like to be able to transfer my save data to my future Kindle devices and hunt achievements for this game. Maybe it will be updated at a later date!<br /><br />Overall I recommend this game to anyone who wants to enjoy a good old school RPG.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of those handy little apps that make life so much easier.  I use this almost everyday and can't imagine not having it on my Kindle Fire. It's so much more accurate than that tiny battery graphic in the upper corner of your screen.  Plus you can even change the colors of your image whenever you get the urge. I highly recommend this clever, useful and yes, even lovely to look at, app.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son loves minecraft and this set can only be bought ONLINE.  (I called LEGO STORES EVERYWHERE) and they said they will not have it in any stores and will only be available online.  I would not have bought this set if it were not my son's bday wish. He finished the whole set in less than 10 minutes (he's 5yo) and after that went on to his lego ninjago set.  For the price, i would get the biglego sets which will take you about a week to build.
B008NABUU8|2.0|Don't buy if you're using a Kindle Fire HD - the program misinterprets the gyroscope feedback from the kindle, resulting in an inability to get the screen to display rightside up (it's always upside down).  No way that I can see to fix.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I played at the regular (not expert) level and it kept me busy for hours. The graphics are very good.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|In all honesty this book took me a while to get into. There is a lot of confusion in the beginning, simply because there are many characters to get to know and understand where they are coming from. Admittedly, by the end of the book, I was hooked I simply had to get my hands on the next book so that I could know what happened to my favorite characters and whether the villains were really all that bad and whether they would get what was coming to them. The twists and turns of this first novel are masterfully done, and by the end it leaves you wanting for more. The authors is extremely true to his characters, and gives each of them equal attention, weaving all of their stories together into a grand tapestry.<br /><br />The only drawback to this book, is that it is definitely not family friendly. This is not a book I would recommend to anyone under the age of 18, and I definitely would not allow children to read it. The reason being that there is a lot of sex and violence in this book, that is inappropriate for an immature audience. For the most part I just skipped over those scenes, and frankly don't think I missed anything. I understand writing for an older audience, but I believe the book would have been more accessible to more people if it did not have all the sex and innuendos. And it would not have compromised the story.<br /><br />Overall a splendid book.<br /><br />Check out [...]

1476712042|1.0|I hated this book.  A lot. Every page to the end hurt my brain with horribly written characters that I could not like.  Every word in conversation felt contrived, forced and fake.  If you like terrible books, this probably isn't good enough to be considered terrible, so you should still avoid it.

1932735410|4.0|Very good book, easy to read, tracks along with the PMBOK but adds much, much more that is on the exam and NOT IN the PMBOK. Highly recommended for anyone preparing for the PMP exam. The only draw backs are that (1) the CDROM only has 24 test questions on it, there are usually almost twice as many at the end of each chapter....so the CDROM does not add any substantive value (2) there is no 'comprehensive test' in the book covering all the processes and knowledge areas. This would be a nice feature to test yourself with a comprehensive review of all knowledge areas and processes.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed this book - has that continuing underlying message that we have to be aware of what is going on in our government.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I'd say this story is nearly perfect in the time and situations created, written and fleshed out.  There are some problems in the storyline itself, but they do not detract from the incredible craft of an astonishingly suspenseful debut novel.<br /><br />The story is simply written all while quite complex, shifting back and forth in time.  (No spoilers but I discuss somewhat.)<br /><br />Catherine Bailey is a free spirited single, enjoying every minute of her life.  She's independent, attractive, gregarious, sexual, intelligent and has confidence.  She's a woman like many of us, having a great time searching for Mr. Right except the card she draws is Mr. Gorgeous Scary Wrong who is very attracted to her,and he systematically lures her in.  He appears on the onset as hypnotic and quite luscious, a great looking, physically dominant man.  But she soon learns he's a lot more than that: secretly obsessive and even psychotic, manipulative, possessive and ultimately untouchable.  Lee Brightman is a detective using the ins and outs of security, bugging, tracking, investigating and tapping into the system he's an officer of.  He makes sure she becomes well aware that he's violent man, quite capable of any action if he thinks she has betrayed him.<br /><br />I would become so frightened at certain junctures of this book, I'd stop reading it for the night.  There was something real and familiar and true in this story, particularly as a woman who knows a little about this, so any flaws were minor because the overall feeling reading it was that it is stunningly accurate and compellingly presented.<br /><br />The writing in this book is just gorgeous!<br /><br />There are major imperfections in the storyline: Catherine makes enormous leaps of progress in her mental health and emotional strength, just in the nick of time AND in a relatively short period of time, too - going from a woman who can't walk from point A to point B without checking the doors and windows 75 times, to someone who is fearless and willing to engage.<br /><br />How does this miraculous recovery occur? Well, she has a dedicated band of men holding her hand and lighting her way.  Men are the extreme alphas and omegas of her existence in this novel, the real primary drivers.  Her life is taken charge by one obsessive man who nearly kills her and then she attracts yet another man who turns out to be an obessive saint who takes charge of her recovery, \\"directing\\" her to yet another man, a singularly brilliant therapist who fascilitates her rapidfire recovery.  Most of the men closely surrounding Catherine are nothing less than completely focused on her care and existence.<br /><br />When I thought about it, it's as if every man in her life was a woman because it's women that are so emotionally available AND so detailed oriented.<br /><br />For me what makes it worse is her closest female friends are for the most part flibbermagibitty and clueless, callous and indifferent to their long time friend's emotional state, utterly insensitive and unsympathic and even predatory towards her.  These extremes detract because they're frustrating and are not real.  Not for men.  Not for women.  There are a few good women floating around this book but it's as if they're sketched in, and it's the men who are fleshed out and the REAL standouts.  (Note that the main heroic character besides the main one, has a man's name.)<br /><br />The resolution is satisfying but at the same time the means to the end detracts from the brilliance.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this book is brilliant.  And for a first novel, more so for it is nothing less than one of the best suspense novels I've read in a long long time.  I can't wait for more from Ms Haynes.<br /><br />PS....if this is a movie, it had better have Daniel Craig as Lee.one who is fearless and willing to engage.<br /><br />How does this miraculous recovery occur?

B008ROGZUU|5.0|This recording of Tosca created from performances on July 14 and 17 in 2011 brings together artists of considerable renown for a short run. These are Angela Gheorghiu as Tosca, Jonas Kaufmann as Cavaradossi and Bryn Terfel as Scarpia. To these must be added the considerable expertise of the conductor, Antonio Pappano. The production by Jonathan Kent has become a staple fixture in the Royal Opera repertoire and is unashamedly `traditional' in its concept.<br /><br />The combination of such talents raised expectations that something very special could be achieved. As one who has a number of recordings by all of these artists, I can honestly state that, in my opinion, none of them has delivered anything finer individually and that this combination has resulted in a recording of Tosca that is gripping from start to finish and may well have exceeded even the most optimistic hopes of all concerned.<br /><br />It must be made clear from the start that this is certainly not the performance that anyone other than purchasers of this disc will have seen as this is a combination of two performances, and presumably the best of each, uniquely available on this disc. Others attending the same production will crucially have heard different combinations of the cast so are not in a position to comment about this particular disc. Even attenders of either of these two nights or those who watched the TV broadcast will still not have experienced this particular edited product. The editing is seamlessly done so the whole final product runs as if it was one live uninterrupted performance.<br /><br />The production, as mentioned above, is traditional but very well observed and convincing. The slowed down, and thus more chilling, entry of the execution squad in act 3 would be one of many examples of dramatic flair. Perhaps the most controversial part is the decision to show Scarpia in an unkempt guise as that would not fit with a serial womaniser. There is another interpretation of this though. Scarpia's libretto makes it clear that he is not interested in wooing any woman but simply exults in his power over them. What better way to reinforce this than to show his utter contempt additionally through his personal appearance? Any woman thus abused would feel doubly defiled.<br /><br />This is a more theatrical production than the fine Verona alternative which was effectively tailored to a much larger canvas. In more general terms, this new recording appropriately offers a more intimate and more subtle rendering of the opera in countless ways throughout and which can only be briefly touched on in a short review such as this and as follows:<br /><br />The outstanding contribution of Pappano and his orchestra cannot be overstated. This is a very flexible account of pace, phrasing and dynamics creating great emotional contrasts. Moments of chilling or dramatic power are contrasted with swiftly following gentle and sensitive passages. Everything is tailored exactly to the drama being played out on stage. A small example of this detailed attention to precise coordination, just as you would expect with a ballet, can be observed after Scarpia's death as Tosca places the two candles by Scarpia before exiting. The very moment that each candlestick bottom touches the floor is precisely accompanied by a soft woodwind chord. Tempo is withheld throughout this sequence as it is performed in free-time and the effect is extraordinarily powerful. Other performances simply are not this accurate.<br /><br />The main cast is of the highest calibre, although there have always been those who do not warm to Gheorghiu as either a singer or as an actor. In my opinion she is on superb form here and delivers an astonishing degree of passion, either in full voice or sotto voce. The tingle factor was high for both me and my wife. Bryn Terfel manages outshines his earlier fine performance of Scarpio under Riccardo Chailly. He exudes evil and has just the voice and body mass to match the intentions of Scarpia as he effortlessly towers over both of his victims. This seemed to be casting against type with the earlier Dutch recording but, even thus prepared, I have been struck by the development in the role. This must almost be definitive. Jonas Kaufmann has the enviable ability to really live his part while delivering singing of tonal magnificence. This has led him to considerable world renown which is fully justified here. His voice has a similar tonal silkiness to my ears to that of Gheorghiu's and thus makes an ideal vocal match between the two. In addition, both Gheorghiu and Kaufmann have the right degrees of physical attraction and relative ages that make this a dramatically convincing coupling thus reinforcing the effectiveness of the drama.<br /><br />The supporting roles are equally effective. The Sacristan, well sung and acted by Jeremy White, has far more character than usual. Little details like his tongue protruding as he concentrates all add to the impression of a subordinate character that could easily be controlled by Scarpia. Lucas Jakobski's Angelotti is also more strongly drawn than usual which is in line with his dramatic role as a suspected revolutionary. Hubert Francis, as a slim Spoletta, brings a level of vindictive evil to match that of the far larger physical presence of Terfel.<br /><br />The camera work is totally engrossing and fully engages with the production. The imaging achieves a state-of the-art HD crispness and colour definition. The sound spectacularly captures the outstanding performance of the orchestra and the balance of the singers seems excellent to me. The sound is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo. There is an 8 minute introduction included which is well presented by Pappano.<br /><br />This is a star-studied production and has obviously aimed high. In my opinion it has hit all the targets and now stands as an outstanding modern version to join the fine but totally different modern production at Verona plus other fine recordings from previous generations. The audience were justifiably and wildly enthusiastic at Covent Garden in my opinion with a marked absence of the famed English reserve! On that basis, it seems likely that most purchasers of this disc to be equally enthusiastic and therefore a 5 star rating seems totally reasonable. This will not be a disc for those who do not respond to this sort of production or these singers of course, but that is not the remit of this review.<br /><br />In conclusion I would suggest that this disc should warrant at least serious consideration from any purchasers looking for a fine modern recording of this popular opera.<br /><br />........................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Hi Ian<br />Just ordered this for Christmas !<br />Colette (UK review)<br /><br />Keep on writing reviews, please, this is just well done.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|As a fan of the books I was a bit nervous about seeing the movie but it was very well done. Diehard readers might get bummed about missing a couple specific scenes and some changes at the end however the impact and quality of the movie is very similar to the book. Minor details might change but the feel of the story remains the same. Also includes some interesting extras in the special features, my favorite is Jennifer Lawrence missing the explosion- so funny, her pout afterwards is priceless. Completely worth purchasing for your dvd collection.
B000007UTN|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my friend and he was most satisfied with it! No scratches on the case or the vinyl itself. No regrets :)
B009X5IL36|5.0|I loved this episode.  The ending was a little unexpected which made it fun.  They developed a bit more of the Holmes-Watson partnership.  I like that Watson is a woman.  It gives it a cool little kick.  I like that she stands up to him, but is also starting to get how he thinks instead of just being offended or awed.  They threw in some classic Holmes \\"moves\\" in the boardroom.<br />I think you would be OK watching this episode out of order.  You might be a little lost, but you'd catch on quickly.

For someone whom has a deep affiliation and so called understanding of Kenyans, I find it hard to believe that there was not and has not been a mention of aparteid. Watch The Rising Son if you need a reminder.  Not only is there poverty and socialist ideals, there are grand scale MURDERS.

B00008BXJG|5.0|This is my favorite AC/DC album of all time.  I like it better now that thirty years have gone by since I first bought it as a kid.
B00008WT5C|5.0|Had this on LP as a kid.  More awesome today. Don't know if they've surpassed the Beatles in popularity but can't see why they shouldn't.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|Enjoyed the movie- but this is a fictional account. Everyone knows Abraham Lincoln was a werewolf hunter! The mistake is forgivable as his training for vampire hunting was cut short by his untimely death. The movie couldn't take all of this into account- I would love to see a non-fictional sequel dealing with his \\"zombie years\\" which began the day after his trip to Ford's theatre!

We have been enjoying the discussions. My husband read the book several years ago and had told me about it, but I had never read it for myself. Opens up your perspective of ways to express love to your spouse.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|This is one of the better retellings of the Bram Stoker classic. The movie begins with the background story of Count Dracul (Gary Oldman), a brave and noble warrior who is loyal to the church and deeply in love with his bride, Elisabeta (Winona Rider). While fighting a battle, a false message is sent to Elisabeta informing her of Dracul's death. In grief, she commits suicide. When Dracul returns to find his beloved dead, he goes into a rage, denouncing God and the church and cursing the world, pledging his vow to rise from death and live by blood. The movie then takes us to an asylum in England, 400 years later, where we are introduced to Renfield (Tom Waits), Count Dracul's loyal servant, incarcerated and quite insane. I won't outline the whole movie... it's a complex story, rich with horror and sinister nuances. Suffice to say it's a very good retelling of Dracula. Gary Oldman is absolutely perfect as Dracul; whether he appears as the historic warrior Count Dracul, the ancient and aged vampire Count Dracul, or the aristocratic vampire Prince Vlad (another persona of Dracula). Tom Waits is superb as Renfield... perhaps the best portrayal by any actor in that role. Anthony Hopkins plays the vampire hunter, Professor Abraham Van Helsing. The weakest link in this movie is the choice of Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. His portrayal is bland and lifeless... and as he is one of the central characters in the movie, his performance diminishes the impact of the movie. Winona Ryder is somewhat below par in her portrayal of Elisabeta/Nina.  Despite the poor performances of those two central characters (the only reason I give this movie four stars instead of five), Francis Ford Coppola's directorial retelling of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a vivid and engrossing tale and a very good movie.

0375507256|5.0|The current edition of this novel was recently released as a tie in with the movie starring Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon.  I did not have an opportunity to read it when it was first released in 2004 but was now caught up in Mr Mitchell's command of the language, his ability to capture completely different moods and delineate a wide variety of characters.  The novel involves six different vignettes loosely allied  at the beginning of the book and than returning to them in reverse order in the last half of the book.  It becomes apparent that there are tie ins from one to the other in spite of taking place in different times and places.  The first involves  an opening in 1850, another in a setting where clones are created to handle the grunt work of civilization and are trying to take their place as equals to normally born human beings.  Settings in most cases involve the south Pacific and Hawai, also touching on England and the United States.<br />  I was made completely aware of Mr Mitchell's ability to change choice of moods and reactions in each story making that section unique in the overall novel.  He is also a wordsmith with a unique command of the English language and an ability to make the reader totally aware of the nuances involved in the story. His moving back and forth through different times and diverse characters in the various sections classifies him as not only a good writer, but perhaps a great one.<br />  A fascinating read and one that will leave the reader very satisfied with what he or she has just read.

B000FC1HBY|5.0|The characters were so real to me in this book, and I felt like I knew them intimately. So when one of them died I was so upset about it, that I refused to read the book any further past the revelation. After I had cooled down a few days, I picked it up again and lets just say by the end of it the entire story had turned on its head again, and nothing was as I had thought it to be. My two favorite characters in the book is Bran and Aria, simply because greatness is thrusted upon them with high expectations, and they admittedly make mistakes all along the way. Often times the external world has big impacts on their lives outside of their control, but they each want to survive, and make right what has gone wrong. For me the two of them are the true heroes of the book, I only hope that this trend continues and that they don't turn out to disappoint in the end.<br /><br />Similar to book 1, I gave this book a rating of 1 out of 5 for family friendliness, because of all the sex and innuendos. This is definitely written for a mature audience, so please be warned. I typically skip over all those scenes, and find that the story does not lack because of it. That at least is one redeeming factor.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, however it was extremely lengthy but I could not imagine cutting anything out.<br /><br />For more reviews go to [...]
0385737955|3.0|Where to start on a review of The Maze Runner? First, a short synopsis:  Sixteen year old Thomas wakes to find himself inside a box that lifts him into a world where teen boys must work on their own to survive (well, they do get weekly supplies) and run through a Maze in hopes of finding a way to escape. All memories previous to this awakening are erased; the large living community is surrounded by giant walls which close at night to keep out the Grievers--a hybrid mechanical animal with the power to both sting and kill. And these boys who are trapped in this community (the Glade) are angry, and doubly so when Thomas's arrival signals a shift in the routine. Follow that up with the arrival of a girl with the note that says she is the last one ever, and the need for escape intensifies.<br /><br />Great, great premise. The idea that a moving Maze somehow must be escaped by boys with no adult supervision is genius. Lots of tension and the threat of danger and death that's real...awesome. There's a bit of gore but not much, and lots of unanswered questions, including why is Thomas so different? Why does a girl show up? What happens when a boy is bitten and goes through the Changing? Lots of good stuff there, and there are sparks of brilliance along the way. The chapters often end on cliffhangers that defy you to stop reading, and the idea of a Griever attack is creepy stuff. By the time I was halfway through, I knew i would have to finish the book because I needed to know how they got out of that freaky Maze.<br /><br />And there goes the good news.<br /><br />It was a struggle to finish this book, but I committed myself halfway through and I meant to keep it. But the characters...I really only liked Chuck, and mostly I just felt sorry for him. Thomas was meant, I think, to be a strong, mysterious boy, and yet he was just clueless and frustrating, as were most of the others. I never warmed up to the \\"leaders\\" Alby and Newt, and Teresa...well, if I knew who she was, I might've been intrigued but really she was a throwaway character because she neither added to nor helped the storyline. Biggest issues beyond those? Lots of the story was transparent including (spoilers....) the names of the characters and WICKED's signs in the Maze. But mostly it was the style of writing, which was supposedly geared to young adult but in actuality is much more for the younger end of that spectrum (perhaps twelve/thirteen). Thomas was said to be sixteen and yet he acted much younger; I never warmed to him because he just didn't seem to be real. And the substitution of \\"shanks\\", \\"klunk\\", etc., for the words we *know* they are saying was just odd and irritating and only led to the aura of a younger mind-set.<br /><br />Worst of all, however, was that non-ending. If the author was trying to ensure that we'd go for the next books, he underestimated his intended audience, because of the five friends I know who have read this book, four of us will not go ahead to the next one simply because of that ending. I won't detail it here, but I will say that the lack of answers and the forced march into The Scorch Trials is a huge turn off.<br /><br />I initially gave The Maze Runner two stars because I *never* take two weeks to read a book of this size, and for the reasons I mentioned above. However, upon reflection, I decided it warranted 2.5 stars (there are some gems in there, and the excitement, when it's good, works well) so I'm allowing that to round up to 3 stars. Consider yourself gifted, Mr. Dashner.ght've been intrigued but really she was a throwaway character because she neither added to nor helped the storyline. Biggest issues beyond those?

B004HW7JH4|1.0|I've just received my DVD box set, and while I have yet to watch a single episode I'm totally disgusted with the cheapness of the packaging design. Inside you have the usual setup, with discs that sit in plastic trays on cardboard that folds out. HOWEVER, the exterior cover is a cheap plastic sleeve open at top and bottom , I had to fight to get the folder out of the sleeve. And putting it back inside the plastic sleeve is near-impossible. Am I the only one who finds fault with this? C'mon AMC, I'd like to believe that you can do better than this. So while I may end up giving five stars for the season itself, I'm assigning one star for presentation. Cheap cheap cheap.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Gorgeous 3D movie.  I own many 3D blu-ray and this one is better than them all.  I went to the theater a few years ago to watch this movie and can honestly say I enjoyed the 3D effects here at home more than in the theater, although this time I was really wishing I had a larger screen.  They did format the movie (1.78:1) to fully fit the screen of my 55\\" HDTV which I really appreciate with 3D movies.  Audio is top-notch as well, so clear and very dynamic.  The excellent 3D and sound of this blu-ray made this so-so movie very entertaining to watch.
140120841X|5.0|All the great things about this comics have already been said in previous reviews, I just wanted to add another 5 star to this amazing comic.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Ok so this is a very exiting book and has alot of  twists and turns, this book is also a Greek/Roman mythology book, it is the third book in heroes of Olympus so make sure you have read the other 2 books, if you like these books you should read the other Percy Jackson books.<br />I hope this has been helpful
B002SZAU1Y|2.0|It was a nice story, a little sad but it lacked depth and substance. The book was predictable so you are better off watching the movie

B0071MQBX0|5.0|I have seen Phantom twice in London and have been a besotted fan ever since!  I first saw this on PBS and decided it needed to be in my home library. The staging is fantastic and all the \\"Phantoms\\" make it even better! Not as good as being there but a wonderful remembrance!

1400067820|5.0|Readers of Nassim's books may have noticed a trend in the direction of his writing, from the street-level view of Fooled By Randomness to the refined prose of The Black Swan. But the route seems somewhat circular, with core ideas revisited in an attempt to refine via more current examples and more simplified prose. Nassim is, in a way, getting simpler, and getting closer to the central point we all knew he had.<br /><br />We saw signs of this central point with Nassim's web-based documents on what he called antifragility, or the ability to get stronger, smarter, faster, or otherwise better when exposed to disorder in all its forms (AKA \\"The Extended Disorder Family\\"). Now, with the book Antifragile, we get to truly see a full rounding of Nassim's ideas complete with their logical conclusion - that we cannot predict black swans or determine what their impacts will be, but we can develop systems that benefit from the inevitability of such events.<br /><br />I suppose I should have seen this book coming, and in a lot of ways I feel foolish for all the side research I did after reading The Black Swan in 2007. I studied complex systems and got in my share of fights with mathematicians who claimed that quantification was the only way to understand how things \\"are.\\" Making mathematicians angry almost seemed worth it, but at the end of the day I just wanted to know what I could do, as a practitioner of the art of living, in order to not just survive but make a lively affair of it. After all, not cracking up is one thing, getting stronger when other things crack up is a whole other kettle of seamonkeys.<br /><br />So here we are, with Nassim's One Book. You can read this and capture all you need to know about black swans, the avoidance of sucker games, and the art of living well in spite of everything that would seem to indicate that you can't control anything in any respect and thus should hit the panic button, visit a iatrogenician for a lifetime supply of thought suppressants, and find a nice \\"safe\\" job where you can make PowerPoint presentations without the fear that you may one day have to pay for the results of your actions.<br /><br />It's all here - Nassim's full scope of antifragile methodologies, given from his uncompromisingly personal perspective. You'll feel like you always do when you read his work, that what you see on the page is very likely the exact thing he'd tell you in person, assuming you can find him and somehow bait him (perhaps with Lebanese wine?) into a conversation he is no doubt growing weary of having. We're lucky he didn't give up in disgust after the financial markets blew up and he started getting pulled into the \\"what do we do now?!\\" rhetoric. So I feel it is our obligation, as humans living in these very interesting times, to read Antifragile as both an antidote to any pessimism that has rooted itself in our guts and as an antibody to protect us from the \\"if this kills you then I'll stand corrected\\" tendencies of educators, policy makers, historians, businesspeople, health care providers, and babblers of all stripes.<br /><br />You get all this and more - a full glossary of virtually all the terms Nassim has introduced us to plus a whole section of technical notes which could be read in lieu of the rest of the book should you have the right pair of eyes to do so.<br /><br />If you haven't read any of Nassim's previous books, I'd advise you continue to do exactly that, and leave them alone until you have pored over Antifragile. All of his other works are supplemental to this, and frankly unnecessary if all you're looking for is the practical application of his ideas.<br /><br />Cheers, Nassim. You just made the book of the century. Humanity owes you one, and if I ever see you on the street or in a cafe I'll do my part and kindly leave you be.ants, and find a nice \\"safe\\" job where you can make PowerPoint presentations without the fear that you may one day have to pay for the results of your actions.<br /><br />It's all here - Nassim's full scope of antifragile methodologies, given from his uncompromisingly personal perspective.

0345803485|2.0|If you have a curiousity about S&M, maybe this book will give you a glimpse inside that world.  Beyond that, it's pretty much a waste of time.  The author chooses to have her characters American and living in Washington state and yet they all speak British language, you can even hear British accents in your mind as you read the dialogue between them.  No surprise to notice the author is British.  Why not just have London be the backdrop if she isn't familiar with American English?  OR... how about getting an American to edit?  So many small mistakes that added up to a poorly thought-out, and poorly written story... why is it that a multi-billionaire as well as everyone else in the book still carry BlackBerries instead of iPhones in 2011?  Um, maybe because that's what everyone still carries in England?  All the formality.... so un-west-coast.  Everyone addressed as Mr. so-and-so, Miss so-and-so.  The American girl's parents also are very formal \\"Mr. Grey, I DO hope you will visit again\\".  Can't you just hear the British accent?  \\"Well done; clever girl.\\" would translate in American to \\"Good job; smart girl!\\"  Couldn't get past this.  I really think it's a dangerous endeavor for British and American authors to attempt creating characters from the other culture without a careful editor.  When the characters are unbelievable, then so is the story.  I love British novels and love to see characters true to their roots. James Herriott did such an amazing job of bringing a Yorkshire accent to all the farmers and townfolk in his beautiful stories for example.  Additionally, while I was initially interested in what S&M is all about, chapter after chapter of it actually got to be boring and redundant.  The formality between Mr. Grey and Miss Steele got old as well.  I am not even remotely inclined to read the sequals to this messy story.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was a wonderfully delightful trip away from the \\"usual flick fare\\" I've been seeing lately. The beauty of the characters and location are what sold me. I just felt like I was wrapped in a favorite warm, fuzzy blanket while I watched. No edge-of-the-seat action or tension-building plot. Just a sweet story played out by some of my favorite aging actors. I'm definitely \\"over the hill\\" and this movie helped me enjoy being here just a bit more.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My brother told me he really like Lee Child books.  I totally enjoyed reading this book. And now plan on reading all his books.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Video quality, acting, story, special effects, ... this has it all included in a package that is riveting ( thought not believable at times).  Better than the Sopranos.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game but slow on coin regeneration. great time passer and coin strategy game. the giant coin is cool. I like the walls too.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had started reading this in paperback form while on a trip and decided to purchase the Trilogy Bundle for my ipad. I am very happy with this purchase and the books are hard to put down. Didn't get much done once I started reading them. For those that don't want anything rather spicy don't buy this as it is HOT in places.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|I have a couple of older Gaslight albums, but I don't even know them by name, which is to say that they were fine, good even, but not memorable. Handwritten, however, is amazing. It is so much better, as a whole, than anything else Gaslight Anthem has put out... I can't recommend it enough.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I thought the movie was really good. I never saw the first Dark Shadows movie, probably never will. Many are comparing it to the first, but without the comparison I though it was very entertaining.
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|I purchased Hooray for fish to download to my kindle fire.  I wanted to have it to show and read to my 8 month old grandson.  He loves it and I love the pictures so bright and colorful and eye catching.  He grabs at it and loves the bright pictures on the screen.  I love the polka dot fish!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I had seen the stage version and was very familiar with the music but this video brought the story alive and made it clear which songs were being sung by which characters.  I would highly recommend this movie version of Phantom.
B002GJU54E|4.0|Love these fun books! A great way to escape reality. Diesel shows up again and is larger than life along with the rest of the great characters from the Stephanie Plum Series. The laughs kept me turning the pages. Great stress-relief!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the first book I've read by this author. I'm definitely hooked. I grab a lot of sci fi off shelves only to be disappointed. What a thrill to find this series and this author. I hightly recommend.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app because it is so helpful I don't go to my settings to look at my battery
B009FZZK8I|5.0|This show is very well acted and you really can get into the actors characters. The story line is great and interesting which makes you coming back for more. They do a great job with the makeup..sometimes I even have to look away during some parts of the show, LOL.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|I saw this film when it came out in the 50's. It is a classic and loaded with superb actors. Peter Sellers plays a multitude of characters and all of the other stars also give memorable performances. There are so many notable quotes that came out of this cold war classic that it is almost impossible to mention them all. A truly great film.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I think Ive watched this movie 6 times on the blu ray and a couple on the dvd.  I wouldve been happy with those at ths price I got all of it.
B001V7SME2|5.0|This film is an absolutely superb rendering of the classic vampire tale but in a modern way. The story is frightening but in a manner that draws you into it. The characters are in their strange way, appealing. I feel it will become a classic.
B007THA4FI|2.0|As an avid HP fan, I was looking forward to seeing what JKR would come up with in her first adult novel.  Although the characters (especially the teens) are rather interesting and well developed, the story itself is weak and more than a little boring.  I found that I was having to force myself to keep reading which is never a good sign.  I would recommend that anyone interested in reading this book not fall for the hype-wait and borrow it from the library.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing story! Loved every minute. What a great bunch of heroes, all the special ops folks are. A great family!
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I love this CD!  Some songs I'd never heard before and there are a few that have now become favorites.  I enjoy this CD every time I listen to it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Having a busy lifestyle, for the last five years I primarily watch movies in my home theater.  Therefore, I wait to read reviews to see if I want to purchase of rent.  Most reviews of the Avengers were so positive I just bought it  - WOW, what a great movie.  This Blu-Ray has great cinematic and Hi-Fedility Surround Sound. The story line was well integrated brining in the Marvel Characters from all the stories into this movie.  Great job Marvel Comics.
B007R4ZNWW|5.0|To reveal any plot or story of this film is a crime.<br />This is the one of my most satisfying cinematic experience of 2012.<br />It is intricately plotted, meticulously written and directed, expertly and selflessly acted (Elena) by the two lead actors<br />and other well cast supporting actors, great cinematography, art direction and music.<br />The film is captivating from beginning to the fitting end.<br />It is engrossing, sexy, shocking, twisted, improbable, bloody but with mature restraint and comment on the present day anti-aging culture.<br />Many prominent filmmakers have passed their prime in their recent works.<br />Almodovar continues to produce his more mature works with his masterful strokes.<br />This is one of his best films and one of the best of the world cinema of the past 2 years.<br />Do not miss the interviews of Almodovar and Banderas in the bonus segment.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|This has been stated a few times already in previous reviews but it bears repeating because this game is the epitome of poor taste.  This game is designed with the intention of leaching money from its participants AT EVERY ANGLE.  Most free games you try will allow you to get your feet wet and enjoy yourself before they move in to slit your throat.  This game does it from the start and you will have to either decide to spend a lot of money quickly and constantly for a game that has very little substance or delete the game and find something that is worth your time.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|For worst movie ever...in close running with 21 Jump Street 2012!<br /><br />Is it just me, or does no one else notice a trend of the main `hero' of movies like this being not only unlikeable, but generally obnoxious screw-ups? (the fact that they're 'over the top' is apparently a given these days).<br /><br />Heck-I can suspend belief for the sake of a good story, but aliens capable of interstellar travel having ships that hop on water (you'd think they'd just fly) and large can openers for weapons?<br />And the bad part is I actually found that more believable than the main character, screw-up that he is, going from beach bum to whatever rank he held in the Navy. Apparently he was still a screw-up, as he was set to be booted from the Navy, but does anyone think someone like this would actually rise to his rank before somebody gave him the boot?<br /><br />Ah well...they say movies these days are created for the 18 to 35 demographic - I guess this one is proof?<br />BTW- even back when I fit that demographic, I would still have thought this was a complete waste of time!
B008TMA1LY|1.0|DON'T BOTHER GETTING THIS APP.  FOUND IT STUPID AND BORING.  PLAYED IT ONCE THEN DELETED IT FROM MY KINDLE. THE FREE VERSION ISN'T VERY INTERESTING AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY JUST CLICKING ON THINGS.  NO SKILL REQUIRED.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I got more than a little bored with this book.  The first of the trilogy was great, the second was ok, but this one, I found myself slogging through just to finish.  I dont recomend it
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Found it much better then the last book. Quick want to read. Characters strong. More like her old self. Read and enjoy.
0345803485|1.0|This book is utterly ridiculous. Some lovesick teenager with an overactive imagination could have written it. I don't get it!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I haven't brought it yet but my friends have it and love i, but now I cant get it because I don't have enough money to pay my parents back :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to get on kindle for a very long time and now its on!!!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Scott is definitely a kindred spirit. This book helped me to get back on my own two healthy feet and start running again. Great book, very inspirational.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this app soooo much right now I'm going for the update for it cant ware to play it!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Overall the video was exciting and well done.  The exception being the contradiction of the Hulk character.  Earlier in the story, he was out of control and would not respond to Scarlett being on his side.  Then later in the street battle with the aliens he seemed to be able to comprehend and co-operate. ???????
B006OCM0G0|5.0|very easy game. I like the multiply choice to make it also nice I do not have to play the whole day. great for any one of any age. try it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|There's nothing I can say about the book that hasn't been said, so I'll just say THANKS AMAZON for making it free
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Yet another brilliant addition to the Heroes of Olympus; bringing more creatures and people from mythology, Rick Riordan has outdone himself with the latest addition. Fantastic novel!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this is a very fun addicting game. Jewel matching with a theme. Challenging without being over hard. Greek history theme is kind of cool too.
0425263908|5.0|I was hesitant to order this book because some reviews said Fifty Shades was better. But I didn't want a book that was replacing Christian Grey, I wanted the same passion that was in Fifty Shades and this definitely did it for me. It's just as intense and just as passionate and though you could compare the two, why? They are individually great books and I recommend both. If you love one, you'll love the other. The only upside to Fifty was that I bought it as a trilogy and now I have to wait until May for the third book of this set to be released. My anxiety builds because I need to know what happens!
034580404X|5.0|EL James writes very well you can picture every detail.  The story is more than just about bondage; there is a love story.  Can not wait to find more books from this author.  Her written work results in the reader not being able to put the book down.
0529064847|1.0|I searched for an enlarged print bible.  When this one came up in the list, I trusted that it was indeed large print. It was not.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Actually, I can't understand how the writer of \\"The Pillars of The Earth\\", and many other outstanding books, might disgracefully have fallen into such a plain uninteresting and disappointing novel.<br />The first two books of \\"The Century Trilogy\\" (what a pretentious overpromising title!) seem to have been written by another - rather simpleton - author.<br />Are they the end result of a team-organized (marketing-oriented) vain work?<br />Do not even try to read it!<br />You'd end up hating a once distinguished paramount novelist.<br />Shame on him!
B008H5J510|5.0|Prior to seeing this movie I was ambivalent about Katy Perry.  After seeing it in the theater as a random movie choice one night with my wife, I can now count myself a fan.  The movie was really well done, multi-dimensional, and the 3D was great.  Everything holds up well in the 3D Blu-ray package.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Great way to pass time & interact with your neighbors as little or as much as you want to.  You are not required to purchase anything but you can buy gems or coins if you wish to.  I've been playing since last winter and still have plenty of improvements to make & dishes to create.<br /><br />Some neighbors take it too seriously and forget that it is just a game.  Don't mind them and your good neighbors will be loyal to you even when the real world takes you away from the virtual one.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Thumbs up!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|At first I thought this was the dumbest gift for someone to buy us, but lo and behold, my son's Wubbanub monkey is his favorite lovey.  It's great for his small hands and I think even after he's done with the pacifier part, he'll still love snuggling and playing with it.  I advise getting two of the same kinds though, right from the start, so you can easily wash and let one dry and still have one to use.  Highly recommended!
B0096DZKZC|5.0|Sonic 4: Episode 2, vastly improves on Episode 1 in every department, and I'd dare say it is the best 2-D Sonic game since Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was released 19 years ago. The game's physics have returned to Genesis-era goodness, and the artwork has a lot of shading, giving Sonic and the stages a strong illusion of depth. Most importantly, the stages are a blast. The level designs (including a flooded castle, an abandoned roller coaster and a desert oil field) and bosses are unique instead of looking like just rehashes of the Genesis games, and their layouts naturally mesh with the art design. The music is also totally original and quite fun. The game requires frequent use of Sonic's usually useless ally, Tails, as they must join forces to overcome obstacles. Tails can carry Sonic in the air for short distances with his helicopter-tail, and the duo can turn into a giant spinball which is needed to break through tough walls. Sonic 4 has the best boss battles in the series by far; I'd dare call the two battles with Metal Sonic \\"epic\\", and the final two stages had my heart racing.<br /><br />If you're an old-school Sonic fan like me, this game will likely live up to or surpass your expectations. In my opinion, it is far superior to the recently re-released Sonic CD and Sonic & Knuckles, both of which have been considered follow-ups to Sonic 3. If you're a newer fan of the 3D-era Sonic games, then this game will feel very different in that there is no dialogue or real story: it's \\"Hedgehog and Fox v.s. Mad Scientist and Robot Hedgehog\\", which is just fine with me. Either way, with 12 normal levels, 7 bonus stages, and 6 very elaborate boss fights, the game is a steal for the price. And, if you bought Episode 1 on the same device, you get Episode Metal, which allows you to play as Metal Sonic through 4 new levels based on the first episode's designs! Give it a spin!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game, its got a lot of twists on the traditional hidden object game, but its yet another one that includes quests which require at least one online friend and that just irritates me.
B0086AYAQ6|5.0|I just saw Valentina perform at a piano store in the Atlanta area.  She played Rachmaninoff's second and third piano concertos through WITHOUT orchestra.  It was an unforgettable performance.<br />This CD is her debut recording with Decca, and I can't recommend it highly enough along with her DVD of the same debut recital.  The Rachmaninoff playing is especially memorable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like this book so much better than the 1st book. This one caught my interest right from the start.  I think that Christian and Anastasia make a great couple.  There is so much chemistry between the two of them and the both of them have so much to learn about each other.  Really keeps my interest. Am looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B008Y212PI|5.0|there are many puzzles on each painting.  there are four or five paintings. a good value for the price. I would recommend.
B004NOH9LC|2.0|This movie was terrible.  Terrible flow.  Didn't like the characters.  Not funny AT ALL.  Rachel McAdams was annoying in it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My wife and I love this movie, which we saw at the theater. We knew we had to get it on blu-ray. We ordered it through Amazon and werent disappointed at the price and the excellent quality of the bllu-ray version. Having viewed it several times now, we are still amazed and look forward to our next viewing of this entertaining movie.
B0067R0APK|4.0|This is a good app if you don't run it all the time If you let it on in background a lot it drains your battery trying to resolve location or connect to internet.
B009I0QTF8|4.0|Fly lo delivers his best yet. It's perfectly paced with a beginning, middle, and end. I read somewhere that this album represents the journey of his life. I can't seem to listen to an individual song. That makes this a rare feat nowadays, an album that carries narrative and has a flow that is bigger than any individual song. Buy this album, it represents the best that electronic music has to offer.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved reading these books.  They took me right there to the scene.  Love!!!! I would recommend these books to anyone.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I never knew that Henry VIII took Mary Boleyn Carey, a young newly-married woman from her husband to be his mistress before he married Anne.  It is well-acted and is historically as accurate as Hollywood can do...Anne and her family are shown to be the schemers that they were.  Benedict Cumberbatch is William Carey, husband of the beautiful Mary played by Scarlett Johansson...he actually resembles a painting of William Carey.  He is only shown in the early part of the movie.  They don't show her going back to him, and the birth of their son Henry.  Eric Bana plays Henry (who I might add never looked that good).  I highly recommend this movie.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Well, I can't believe it's come to this. The author must have fallen asleep between his signature page turner end of chapter lines. I would turn the page, expecting some sort of excitement, and end up with the equivalent of a print ad for antacid. Honestly I fell asleep over and over. What was the point of this. It makes bad tv, specifically sitcoms, appear appealing in contrast. I only finished it because I paid for it on Kindle, usually I chuck this sort of thing in the garbage after a rapid riffle thru to see if there is anything remotely interesting. In this case, there wasn't.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|****Whats going on why aren't the kindle fire users getting the holiday editions of games? the last holiday edition we received was Thanksgiving, what happened to the Christmas edition? my husband was able to get it on his android phone but it never appeared in kindle marketplace, are we getting the Valentine edition and this goes for all other team lava games as well, were is the kindle updates?!?!?!?<br /><br />love the game just wish I could be able to play when not near an Internet connection,
1451695195|3.0|If near-death experiences (NDEs) interest you or if you are skeptical about the veracity of NDEs, Dr. Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven may be your book-- although an investigative report in Esquire has raised doubts about the accuracy of Alexander's account.<br /><br />Proof of Heaven is of special interest in this genre because the NDE is reported by a Duke University-trained neurosurgeon, who taught neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School; has written and published numerous peer-reviewed papers on neurosurgical techniques and outcomes; and has practiced neurosurgery at Boston's acclaimed Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard teaching facility, as well as at Lynchburg, Viginia's Lynchburg General Hospital.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander's NDE occurred during a seven-day medically-induced coma induced by an extremely rare case of E. coli meningitis.  The detail and authority of Alexander's medical account is at the core of Proof of Heaven, and adds immeasurably to the impact of the book.  According to Alexander, his neocortex (the area of the brain that mediates consciousness), was rendered inactive during his coma and was incapable of producing or assimilating the rich, variegated experiences that he encountered during his NDE.  Of keen interest as well is that Dr. Alexander was hooked up to monitoring equipment during his coma, and that the reported data are presumably inconsistent with the NDE that he reports.<br /><br />Equally of interest is Alexander's ability to evaluate the scientific theories of NDEs against his own experience.  The doctor believes that current medical theories of NDEs are inadequate to explain his experience.  Briefly, according to Alexander, current theory would explain brief, disorganized or confused  memories or thought patterns during an NDE.  Alexander reports, however, that his own NDE was lengthy, coherent and richly detailed-- a seemingly impossible medical outcome in the absence of a functioning neocortex.<br /><br />In an afterword to Proof of Heaven, Dr. Alexander notes that he has co-founded an organization, Eternea, to collect data on NDEs and other spiritually transformative experiences (STEs), to conduct scientific research in these areas, and to bridge the gap between scientific theory and spirituality.  This is a hopeful, constructive and immensely important endeavor.<br /><br />For the above reasons, I recommend Dr. Alexander's book with caveats, as discussed below.  As for the actual NDE, I found it relatively flat and impersonal, especially when contrasted to other books in this genre.  (Dr. Alexander notes that he experienced the NDE largely from a perspective of disembodied consciousness, rather than as Eben Alexander.) During his NDE, Dr. Alexander moved repeatedly between three areas:<br />  (1)An \\"underworld\\", characterized by a feeling of imprisonment in a primordial sludge;<br />  (2)A \\"gateway area\\", that would roughly conform to most human conceptions of heaven; and<br />  (3)A \\"core\\", an area of simultaneous darkness and illumination, which embodied a sense of advanced consciousness, all-encompassing knowledge, and a presence that many might identify as God.<br /><br />While Dr. Alexander's NDE is conceptually interesting (to me, it relates to the ongoing human struggle to transcend limitations, and the account roughly corresponds to religious accounts of purgatory and heaven), it was this aspect of his book that I found the weakest, owing to its somewhat impersonal flavor.<br /><br />CAVEATs:  Alexander's account has been investigated extensively by Esquire magazine. Esquire reports that there are a number of concerns related to Alexander's personal history and the events depicted in Proof of Heaven:<br />  1. Alexander fails to disclose multiple malpractice suits against him.  Of these, the most serious was an operation in which Alexander allegedly operated on the wrong surgical site and attempted to falsify related records to cover up his error.<br />  2. The ER doctor whotreated Alexander during the coma described in Proof of Heaven denied to Esquire that Alexander lost the underlying ability to reason consciously during his coma.  The ER doctor also notes that the coma was medically induced, not spontaneous-- an important detail that is omitted from Proof of Heaven.<br />  3.  The National Weather Service, according to Esquire, partially refutes Alexander's account of the local weather conditions prevailing during and immediately after Alexander's coma.<br /><br />The caveats reported by Esquire do indeed diminish the credibility of Alexander's  NDE account.treated Alexander during the coma described in Proof of Heaven denied to Esquire that Alexander lost the underlying ability to reason consciously during his coma.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was an amazing book about the importance of friendship. Without friends there to support and guide us, we would get very off track and do some pretty horrible things. The perks of being a wall flower was a great book that really makes me cherish the friendships I have.

0307730697|5.0|An amazing captivating story. A rags to riches outcome that demonstrates that nothing is impossible to those who persevere. Brutally honest. True. Forcing the reader to appreciate the sacrifices that are made by selfless warriors to overcome evil and maintain the freedom that we take for granted. I am a kiwi but acknowledge with gratitude the sacrifices that brave men and women make for their country, their family and others in this worls. Adam - thank you and thanks to your colleagues and their families.<br /><br />The book was moving and drew me to tears in its closing chapter. That has never happened to me before. Rest in peace and enjoy the Lord.<br /><br />what a life and what a story.

B003PBB4ME|3.0|Pretty good product for the price.  Kind of annoying that it doesn't fit my camera w/ the battery grip and even more annoying that it came with a broken stand.
B008BDZP30|4.0|I purchased \\"Chunga's Revenge\\" based on user reviews. To me, it's not as good overall as \\"Hot Rats\\", but I'm very glad I made the purchase.  The first cut, \\"Transylvania Boogie,\\" by itself is well worth the price of the album. I also find the more I listen, the more I like the album.
B0078XHAB4|5.0|Brilliant wee book, didn't want to put it down! Nice easy read with a heartwarming story.<br />5 stars from me

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have stuck to this workout from the very beginning. Which I am not good at sticking to anything. I started off with Level 1 for 10 days, then to Level 2 for 10 days, then Level 3. I love how it is only 20 minutes, plus more with the warm up and cool down, and it's the 3-2-1, strength, cardio, and abs. I saw a difference after 2 weeks, and now I can fit into a pair of jeans that are 2 times smaller than my normal size. I was looking to do that before my birthday so I can wear those jeans. Jillian Michaels delivers. You do have to push yourself and go stronger each day to get the results. You do make it as hard or as easy as you want it, but like Jillian says you have to keep pushing yourself to see results in just a 20 minute workout, and she's right. If you do you will see some results. Now I'm ready to move on to her 30 Day Ripped to see what I can accomplish before Christmas, and make certain cousins mad.

1601251556|4.0|Good thing for anyone who does rpgs that need something to use either for combat, or as a map or something. I've been pretty happy with mine, the only complaint I could have is that it's quite folded up from travel, and it really needs to be held down by blocks for each corner in order to get the best use out of it that you can. But, it's exactly what's described, and I'm happy.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|This book is mind numbingly awful.  Women should not find  this kind of man attractive. The protagonist is irritating and not someone I would not want my daughter to be like
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|What if your entire life was a fabrication? Watch the movie and see it happen. Loved the show. Loved the premise.
B007RV6X2Y|3.0|this film had everything needed to be great but missed the mark...not by much, but still; missed. The cast, music, editing, etc. was up-to-par & it beat many expensive films....but still. The director did a great job (first film?) and I hope he gets better stories and bigger budgets.  Would I recommend renting?  Wait until it's on HBO or Showtime.

B009VB97EY|1.0|I went with girlfriends, I'm not a prude, I saw the Sex in the City movies with girlfriends, too - I saw MORE in Sex and the City, and we were laughing and had a great time. This movie made me feel sad and a little dirty. It tried to be more than it needed to be, or was, it wasn't fun. It never found it's footing and it was just depressing. There aren't enough half naked guys in the world to make it worth watching. And really, I don't get that grinding stuff anyhow. I think Gilles Marini was hotter in a few seconds of washing himself than all those guys were in the hour plus of torture this movie was. You won't listen to me and you'll still watch it, but don't say I didn't warn you.<br /><br />And maybe it's my age or that I'm a Mom, but the fact that one of the main strippers is 19 really bothered me.

B005DF2QMC|3.0|This little jewel does exactly what it says it will do.  Well, for about two tapes, maybe.  You would really be better off paying a professional to convert  one or two of your favorite tapes than to spend the money on this thing that goes into the trash very quickly.  I was hoping to convert all the wonderful music I bought in the eighties along with the irreplaceable things that I recorded myself.  Not going to happen.  I was able to convert my college recital performance tape and that was it.  The drive motor gave up the ghost during Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique.  I knew this when the oboe started playing with a really weird and slow vibrato that you could drive a truck through.  If you want to do your own conversions, buy a really good machine.  Otherwise, pay someone who has to do it for you.  It was worth a try... but that's all it was worth.  Sorry, but I can't recommend this machine.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This CD is wonderful!!!! I can't understand why Rodriguez wasn't known at all in this country!!! His lyrics are great and the total musical experence is awesome!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Avengers brought together all of the earlier roles from Thor, Captain America, Hulk and Iron Man creating a cohesive hero evolution.  It started fast, and it doesn't slow at all.  I also liked the diner scene at the end.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|nice movie ....would recommend this to a friend. may even rent this again, keep me on the edge of my seat
B000I5X81A|5.0|I'm diggin' this album. I sometimes like to see where my musical sensibilities are relative to others, so I looked at the reviews. Generally, I find the critical reviews more interesting and revealing. It was curious to note that the most critical feedback came from serious Clapton fans who were anticipating more of a Clapton trademark studio effort. If I was expecting raw Clapton while listenting to The Road to Escondido, it would be like taking a swig of milk while expecting orange juice to hit your pallet. If a listener isn't familiar with or doesn't appreciate the genius of JJ Cale (which permeate all tracks), it's not surprising the appreciation for this remarkable collaboration wanes. On the other hand, if one digs JJ Cale, this album starts as 4 stars, and if you like Clapton's flavor, this album is a 5 star gem.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is one of the best of the genera, with excellent graphics, dynamic sound, good music that is interesting to listen to without getting boring, very natural voice acting, and game play that is challenging without being tedious. Highly recommended!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|it grabs your attention from the first page, but when Ethan is trying to escape Wayward Pines, it drags out a bit to long for me. But still a good read
B008EZVNO0|5.0|I have probably listened to nearly a dozen Van Morrison albums in the past decade since I \\"discovered\\" him (my first love was \\"Meaning of Loneliness\\"). While it can be said that Morrison is always at his game, this last album sounds like a culmination of the very cream of all his last albums. Each song will remind you of a favorite from way back (Goinw Down to Monte Carlo, for example, is somewhat reminiscent of the title I mentioned above). The orchestrations are superb and at times surprising, and Morrison's velvety voice seems to be richer and more comforting than ever before.<br />With some classic Blues sounds thrown in (e.g. in Pagan Heart), this is without a doubt the best new album of 2012.
B008B92U32|5.0|Awesome!  Swapping faces is easy and you can make quick adjustments.  Nicely done!  Swapped my wife's head with my six year old.  It allowed me to change the size of their heads to match body.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Riveting! I couldn't put it down. I cannot wait to start the next book. This one was so full of excitement. I can't wait to see what's next.
1401235417|5.0|Batman is rebooted back to #1 in this new series and DC has released this really neat hardcover containing issues #1-7 of the new series! Batman takes on a mythical Court of Owls and must fight a force that has been haunting the Wayne family for over a hundred years! Batman, and his family, must take down these owls before they hunt down every last bat in Gotham!<br /><br />Here we have arguably the best series to come out of the new 52 reboot. Batman takes on what was a nursery rhyme and now an army of reanimated corpses fighting for an organization that predates Bruce himself! The mystery that builds up in these issues is very fun to read as, more and more, you see owls in the background stalking Bruce and his family at every turn and when they strike, it's made all more epic as they get the jump on the great detective! Issue 5 is by far my favorite as Bruce is drugged and as he becomes more confused and delirious, the comic reads like a calendar and then moves to reading completely upside-down! The art here by Greg Capullo is fantastic and works very well for this series and Snyder is writing a grade-A story here that will spill over into the Night of the Owls crossover event that will be collected into a hardcover volume and scheduled to release in February. There's also a script, character sketch gallery, and a really nice variant cover gallery as well as all the normal, textless covers within the book. Overall, it's a very, very fun read to go through over and over again and never dulls out.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'll loved the book, it was very well written but not as good as the previous. Thank you Rick Riordan!
B000EDQCC8|5.0|As others have mentioned in their reviews, I paid $250 for this collection in 1990. At the time it was the premiere version of the films.<br />The set contains all 3 original films in mostly unaltered condition (before George Lucas started playing with them) plus a couple of frames of film from one of the prints (35 mm print) and the hardcover book  \\"The Creative Impulse\\" by George Lucas.<br />The picture quality is superb, only bested by the Blu Ray collection, but the Blu Ray's have been heavily modified by Mr. Lucas.<br />They are packaged in a sturdy box and have no known defects.<br />We've all seen these movies a zillion times so I won't bother to revisit plot, I will only say that if you have a working laser disc player this set it a must. Although the value hasn't increased over the years, when laser disc becomes a faint memory and landfills are littered with discs, it should command an astronomical price since the is the last time these motion pictures were released before George's tinkering.
B009PAETCG|5.0|it is really fun and if you use the tutorial than you can learn a lot more and then the game will be a lot more fun than it already is.

B009QW6ZT8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows. It has action and drama and strong characers. At this point and the next episode the crew is fighting to survive and must battle their way into a prison full of zombies. The action is tense and the effects gory as you would expect from this show. There isn't much room for deep character discussions like the ones you saw in season 2, but we know these characters very well by now. I am sure they will have a slower one around the bend sometime. But maybe not. At least we get 8 episodes , then a break and 8 more. But in reality something this popular could go for a twenty ep run easily! The acting is as strong as ever and that's a big plus.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Very good toy and a good gift for boys. If you are looking for a gift for boys from 7 to 12 this is a good toy for them.
B009UQC7NS|5.0|This remains a drama first about people. This episode is more about their fight to take the prison from not only zombies but criminals as well. It moves much more quickly than some of this shows episodes. Obviously the eps will slow down a bit when they are more secure. I loved season two even during it's slower episodes. SOme guy on here , wants every ep to be like those but it's not possible and it doesn't fit the story at this point. They need to take the prison , they can't slow down and have intercharacter drama at this point.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan and his books have always held a special place in my heart, and each one was extremely fun to read, and very engaging. This one was exactly that- fun and engaging. despite the fact that he hits on some complicated subjects, like being and outsider, Riordan manages to keep it light most of the time (and family friendly as well). can't wait for the next book!
B009SRJA0W|5.0|I lvoe this show , but my favorite episodeas were always the ones where the boys were out hunting down monsters. the big world saving arvs were fun but they would lose sight of this fact. This episode is simply the boys tracking down monsters who eat hearts and they are interesting because they are actually human!.  I have yet to see a bad episode of this show and that's a testament to it's actors and writers.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Kendrick Lamar's debut effort [[ASIN:B00913P6G0 Good Kid: M.A.A.D City [Deluxe Edition]]] materializes just at the right time to give West Coast rap some renewed notability. Kendrick Lamar is one today's most unique rappers. Left of center, he joins the likes of Drake and KiD CuDi, paving his own pathway. Good Kid m.A.A.d City is not only one of 2012's best rap albums but also one of the year's `crowning achievements.' Conceptually structured around its title - Kendrick is ultimately a good kid trapped in Compton, which is chucked full of vices within the sins/demons of a bad, rough city - Lamar details his early life experience.<br /><br />\\"Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter\\" opens with a prayer that ultimately alludes to the title of the album. Featuring soulful, old-school production by Tha Bizness, \\"Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter\\" finds Kendrick narratively lusting for a 'no-good' girl. Lamar's rhymes are agile and well conceived, eliminating need for a hook (there is none).  As customary throughout the effort, an interlude (skit) foreshadows successive tracks, much like a novel.<br /><br />On \\"B*tch, Don't Kill My Vibe,\\" producer Sounwave's production incorporates a Boom Clap Bachelors sample (\\"Tiden Flyver\\").  Over a lush, west coast characteristic sound,  Lamar is on autopilot, admitting his improprieties while also admonishing anyone to attempt to block his individuality as a person and artist. Lamar's vocal inflections and athletic flow help to make this cut another brilliant contribution.<br /><br />\\"Backseat Freestyle\\" sports some of Hit-Boy's best production work.  The Intro/outro is particularly notable by Lamar: \\"Martin had a dream, Martin had a dream, Kendrick have a dream...\\"  Lamar's hook is equally confident, where he desires 'money,' 'power' and 'respect,' with more colorful terminology of course.  Lamar remains relevant and uncompromising, managing themes of childish fodder (desiring material things like money) yet also lofty self-esteem and aspiration ('I can be the greatest').<br /><br />\\"The Art of Peer Pressure\\" begins with production yielding a 'stoner' vibe. It changes upon the first verse, accelerating the tempo and opting for a less lush/lazy sound.  Playing like the `tone poem' it is, unpredictability here  parallels `unpredictability' of peer pressure. The outgoing interlude, confirms this notion, referencing drug-use. \\"Money Trees,\\" produced by DJ Dahi, samples indie-pop band Beach House (\\"Silver Soul\\"). The cut continues to possess a characteristic west coast vibe. Jay Rock guests on verse three (\\"Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree...\\") while  Kendrick holds it down with numerous clever lines (\\"I f___ Sherane then went to tell my bros/then Usher Raymond \\"Let it Burn\\" came on...\\")<br /><br />\\"Poetic Justice\\" eclipses the former two cuts, featuring Drake in top-notch form.  Lushly shaped by Janet Jackson's \\"Any Time Any Place,\\" Scoop's production is terrific. Anchored by a simple, though effective hook (\\"You can get it...and I know just, know just...what you want/poetic justice, put it in a song\\"), \\"Poetic Justice\\" is one of the album's strongest moments.<br /><br />\\"good Kid\\" is produced by Pharrell Williams and features Chad Hugo (The Neptunes) on the hook. Soulful yet mysterious, as always, Kendrick continues to compel and lure in the audience. Companion track \\"m.A.A.d City\\" contrasts \\"good kid's\\" soulfulness in favor of harder production.  Kendrick's rhymes are incredibly emotional while fellow Compton rapper MC Eiht delivers a compelling verse.  Both \\"good Kid\\" and \\"m.A.A.d City\\" are `A' cuts, like the majority of good Kid m.A.A.d. City.<br /><br />Breakthrough single \\"Swimming Pools (Drank)\\" finally appears, featuring exceptional production work from standout T-Minus.  Kendrick Lamar manages to tie swimming pools and alcohol together incredibly, most notably on one of 2012's most memorable rap hooks: \\"...why you babysittin' only two or three shots? I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch/first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/pool full of liquor, then you dive in it...\\" Despite its reprised greatness on the album, \\"Swimming Pools\\" may not even be the album's best song!<br /><br />\\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\\" clocks in at an incredible twelve-plus minutes. The first portion (\\"Sing About Me\\") samples jazz guitarist Grant Green. \\"When the lights shut off/and it's my turn to settle down/my main concern, promise that you will sing about me...\\" Lamar sings on the hook, matching the mysterious, somber vibe of the cut. The next portion,  \\"I'm Dying of Thirst,\\" contrasts the production and opts for quicker tempo. Quite mysterious though captivating, \\"I'm Dying of Thirst\\" loses no momentum A notable skit closes the cut, in which Kendrick's grandmother urges Kendrick and friends they are `dying of thirst' in relation to their `faith.' Cleverly, the opening prayer from \\"Sherane\\" is placed in context.<br /><br />\\"Real\\" proceeds, featuring lush and soulful production. Not the cream of the crop, \\"Real\\" is above average. Closing cut (standard edition) is third single \\"Compton,\\" featuring Dr. Dre.  Produced by Just Blaze, \\"Compton\\" samples Formula IV (\\"What's This World Coming To\\"). Kendrick and Dre cleverly split verses, ultimately summing up the sentiment of \\"Compton\\" via its hook: \\"Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine...\\" The Deluxe Version includes additional cuts, most notably single \\"The Recipe,\\" also featuring Dr. Dre.<br /><br />As previously stated,  [[ASIN:B00913P6G0 Good Kid: M.A.A.D City [Deluxe Edition]]] as it is one of the year's very best albums, easily. Lamar ultimately conceives the next great concept album, which is no easy task. With no misses of note, good Kid m.A.A.d City is even better than advertised.u how to turn it up a notch/first you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it/pool full of liquor, then you dive in it...\\" Despite its reprised greatness on the album, \\"Swimming Pools\\" may not even be the album's best song!<br /><br />\\"Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst\\" clocks in at an incredible twelve-plus minutes.

B0083SBMBM|3.0|The movie itself was awesome! Seen in the theater, the movie ROCKS! Hulk vs. Loki was my best part!! However, the DVD's a whole 'nother story!<br /><br />The DVD was disappointing. The movie was still good, but that's all it had. I expected it to be like Iron Man or Spider-Man...all the other frills included. How the Avengers came to be, maybe a gag reel or deleted scenes. SOMEthing besides JUST the movie!! But, nope- that's all you get. Disappointing would be how I'd sum up the DVD.
B008ENA74E|2.0|Many better books have been written about Wall Street and the crisis  In this one, Greg portrays himself as a hopelessly naive but upstanding rising star of Goldman Sachs who becomes more and more disgusted by the firm's increasingly mercenary culture.  Greg's complaints about GS are very vague, he never gives any real detail of dirty dealings that we can judge.  I had three problems with the book:<br />1.  The writing is dull, there's no humor, insight, interesting anecdotes or ability to set a scene.<br />2.  Much of the description of developments at GS are dumbed down summaries of things that have been covered extensively in newspapers before.<br />3. Greg comes across as an insufferably annoying protagonist: frequently telling us how great he is, expecting to be extremely well paid but looking down at anyone who pushes hard to make money for the firm, humorless and self-righteous.<br />While GS and Wall Street deserve a great deal of analysis and criticism, this book doesn't deliver.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Another great legal thriller by grisham. I chose this one to see if it was also suitable reading for English learning teenagers and it bas certainly proved so. Well planned and nicelydesigned, it develops into a credible schoolcentered series of mates legal and social issues. The leading plot is a mastterpiece of the genre but well adapted to the family situation, which adds to its feasibility.<br />Lots of interesting by,topics arise from the reading for further classroom debate
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like these types of games & of all the 1s I've tried, this 1 is the best. the only downfall is that when u run out of energy it takes a long time 2 build back up, especially if u don't have any $ 2 buy the snacks. other than that it is a very fun & addictive game. plus it is free so u cant go wrong downloading it & giving it a try! the worst that could happen is u don't like it, but its not that hard 2 uninstall it :) The only complaint I have is......WILL THEY EVER GIVE US KINDLE FIRE USERS AN UPDATED VERSION?? ****ADD ME AS A FRIEND, I PLAY ON KINDLE FIRE. MY PLAYER NAME IS: NinaKay. I had 2 start completely over again cuz I bought a new kindle, but it doesn't save my progress, as I was on level 132!! But now I'm clear @ the beginning on level 2 :'( SUCH A HUGE BUMMER!!!!
0316212377|5.0|This is the latest book set in Iain M Banks' \\"Culture\\" universe, a far future pan-galactic civilization composed of many races (only some of them humanoid), sentient spaceships and artificial worlds, machine intelligences, malleable bodies, and other wonders. Every Culture book is different, with different characters and civilizations, only the general universe is the same. This book concerns events surrounding the desire of one race to \\"sublime\\" and transcend normal corporeal three dimensional existence and a conspiracy by part of that's race's ruling elite to suppress information that could upset those plans.<br /><br />Interstellar intrigue, dastardly deeds, a beleaguered heroine far out of her depth, cynical spaceships, quirky humor, thrills and chills.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game is alright. getting all those points is annoying. takes forever to get new simple games. at least it was free
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A good Jack Reacher Novel with a twist. If you like Jack Reacher, you will enjoy this novel. Another good story by Lee Child.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This is the first book I have read where I can only hope the movie will be better.  It was a slow read and was not detailed enough.<br /><br />The story line was interesting and I read the book because of the movie previews.  I just wanted more.
0316223239|3.0|this book was more than a little creepy. at first the 5 year old seems quite immature then the story unfolds of the captivity and the planned escape. the mother is a 19 year old frozen in time and does not relate well to her family--hard to feel empathy for her because her personality is over=mothering or angry. the dialogue being from the child and a very verbally stunted  child is tedious after a few pages. I kept reading as we are discussing it at bookclub but it does not live up to the hype unless you enjoy children and young adults being terrorized and their subsequent functioning being reviewed. The characters although very interactive seemed 2 dimensional
B0068TJLSY|4.0|Not sure what the image difference is from a TV to a laptop, but watched this on my Macbook and a lot of the scenes were very dark. If they were outside at night or in a dark room, it became very hard to see everything that was going on.<br /><br />And for some strange reason this reminded me of something like the Goonies, an adventure movie with kid actors. Interesting movie, it's a good watch.
B000FA57US|5.0|For some strange reason, this one has always been my favorite in the series. Particularly from the forest scene onto the end. As a child, it had really stuck in my mind.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This sequel seems very contrived.  I quit reading it about 1/4 through the book, and haven't been interested enough to pick it back up.  Oh, well.  I thought the first book was very good.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. Having recently travelled to England fro New Zealand it was great to relate to the route that Harold took. Who would have guessed the trauma that Harold  had endured. I will be recommending this book to everyone who loves a good read.
1451695195|5.0|What a wonderful, intelligent book. The story goes back and forth between the afterlife and the author's personal life as he lay in the coma. I was deeply touched by the discovery of his sister's guiding role.<br /><br />We end up with a vivid picture of a very real human being with unique gifts and struggles. He includes medical information because that's part of what he is, a doctor. He talks about how mistaken scientists are who claim that science and spirituality can't coexist.<br /><br />I loved his natural descriptions of the afterlife without using traditional words from religion or science; the fundamental role of consciousness as the basis of all that exists; the sensation of being above linear time; the message that our eternal spiritual self is more real than anything we perceive in this physical realm, and has a divine connection to the infinite love of the Creator; and how unconditional love is the single most important truth of all.
B006NXI58M|5.0|I couldn't put it down once you start clear all plans you wont be able to stop! My friends said it was good so i read it and will tell others about it .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After hearing both negative and positive reviews from family and friends I decided to read it myself. I personally love the book. There's much more to the story than BDSM. Yes it is a part of it and if that's all you think it's about then you should most definitely not judge a book by its cover. There's an actual story behind it about two people who fall in love with each other despite their flaws and what society might think. Yes it's a book and nothing in such detail would ever happen but the over a;; tone and theme is that loving someone for who they are flaws and all is something everyone should aspire to.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Ordered it the day it came out. And i got in2 days.<br />Such a great movie. I've watched it like 50 times already.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it and read book 3 also! Can't wait till book 4!!! Had me hanging on the edge wanting more!!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My whole family loves it.  My three boys and my 2-year-old girl sit down and listen to it like they're watching a movie.  They'll even pretend to play the cello while they listen.  The youtube videos are great!  ...but they don't need them to enjoy this CD. I love the music.  I hope they keep making more of this music!!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Ok,  not a huge fan of these books its all weird sex and not much eles that worth reading but this one is the best of the Best Of the first two any way. Sill not a great read but ok there's a little more of a story then the first one.so if u read the first one you mite as well read this one is.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Beautiful product. Interface is smooth and efficient. The only thing that comes with a few quirks is the profile interface on the Kindle and the lack of editing ability the app gives you straight on. Interfacing with the site itself though is a breeze.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wow I'm so happy that I gone have this game because I was a gonads get this game because I'm gone get it because this kindle
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were some of the best books I have ever read. I am about to read all three again. Fifty Shades are some great books and if you have not read them, you dont know what you are missing.
B005S9EJ46|4.0|Great acting and good story as many movies, less is more.  Editing would make this a very good movie.  I gave it a 4 star but to be kind more of a 3-3.5.  Subject is a bit disturbing of elderly facing golden years with cooper saving accounts.  On a high note; there are great places in the world to retire besides the USA, so very inspiring.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easy
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the game options like random or winning hands. It works great on my kindle fire. the only thing I don't like are the ads.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|Ridley Scott's prequel to the Alien franchise is not quite as in your face scary as Alien, but it's obvious he wanted to set the stage for the rest of the Alien creepfest. Charlize Theron is stunning (as always) and Noomi Rapace looked great even without all the piercings she sported in \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\". Overall the acting was on pace with the genera and the directing was every bit as good as one would expect from Mr. Scott. The visuals were state of the art. I look forward to watching it again. I give it a solid 4 stars. I liked it enough to buy the Blu-Ray version for my library.

B00984668E|5.0|First and foremost, I must say that this album is worth it just because of the amzing ZZ Top cover, \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\".  It's f'n GREAT!!!<br /><br />Typical Sword, but with some great synthesizers and more of a Black Sabbath feel than the previous three Sword albums.  Nothing slow or depressing here, just straight up ROCK.<br /><br />All I really have to say is if you liked the last three Sword albums, you'd definately want this one.  BUY IT!
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easy
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Fantastic movie!  This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who is a fan of the eighties rock era.  All of the stars pay incredible homage and due justice to all the songs.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Quick read in only 2 days. I couldn't put it down. The only small issue I had with it was that the  \\"scenes\\" seemed to go on and on a little too long.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I picked the first book, The Name of the Wind for a casual book club and it did not disappoint.  I was weary of picking fantasy as there are plenty of tropes that are reused endlessly and numerous cliches.  It was a refreshing book -- there were familiar fantasy elements, but the originality shines though.<br /><br />So I picked up the second book and I must say I'm extremely pleased with this book.  The story, the pacing, the dialog, the characters -- all of it.  It's strong sequel to the first book and I would easily recommend it (after reading the first of course).  Rothfuss has a really excellent story telling ability and it's a refreshing change from so much of the fantasy drivel out there.<br /><br />It was really, really hard to put this book down; I found myself up till 3-4am reading despite work in the morning (no regrets!). I can barely wait for the third!
B0029O08WA|5.0|i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easy
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game has great graphics &amp; lots of levels so you will have lots of play time. It's a bit repetitive though.
1401322786|5.0|I rarely write reviews,  but I rarely read a book in just one day. ( okay, it's only 200 pp, but still) Started it before work and couldn't wait to get home to finish it.  The characters are well developed, and while some have less-than-redeemable qualities, I found myself rooting for them. the writing format made me anxiously, but pleasantly, await events to come.  Thoroughly mesmerizing , captivating, and uplifting.
B007R41E8O|2.0|What dick-brain envisioned the apathetic, cigarette-smoking mannequin in cocktail dress &amp; stilettos? And where are these supposed &quot;bloodcurdling visuals&quot;? Never mind that it crashes &amp; restarts after every hidden-object mini game. Also, PRE-PURCHASE notice of the additional 350MB data download would've been nice, instead of AUTOMATICALLY initiating download w/o even ASKING first. Because if you're not prepared, meaning 'connected via Wi-Fi or 4G', forget it. Watching paint dry will be faster.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This was a truley scarey movie.  Very informative and utterly terrifying insight into what the government allows corperations to do to us.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Flawless top to bottom. I get the feeling 5-10 years from now this will be looked at as a Hip Hop Classic and will leave a footprint that will stand the test of time for years to come. This is a brilliant masterpiece. Any fan of Hip Hop should own this whether digital or physical.
B007WULJ5G|1.0|This is the worst tasteless film I have ever seen,  I literally snapped it in half and tossed it in the trash where it belongs,  disgusting.
B00846REIS|1.0|The novel was a copy of the Shades of Gray novels. The characters were too similar to not notice. I would not recommend this novel at all.
0345525558|4.0|For those of you who work or live with someone who has attachment challenges, clinical tomes can get old.  Sometimes it is nice to actually read a story.  This book serves two purposes.  First, you get to learn the language of flowers which is a lovely way of using horticulture to express oneself.  In addition, it is an opportunity to see, from a child's perspective, what is like to have an attachment disorder.  We often get the point of view of the family or the clinician so this is a chance to see the experience through the eyes of a child.  Diffenbaugh did her homework!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Up to the standard of the rest of his books, will definitely be waiting for the next book to come out.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I bought this book pre-ordered, so I did not have to pay for the current 20$ price, only 13$. For a good Follet it did not seem much. Unfortunately, the book is worse than the first in the Century Trilogy and certainly overpriced. A typical example of basing the price on one's name and not the book's merit - but we live in a market economy where the price is defined by demand. Until demand lasts.<br /><br />Characters are less believable than in the Book One of the trilogy and the storyline is less exciting. There is a lot of research behind, no question about it, so it is a pity that the author did not work more on the story.<br /><br />I read 5 other books by Ken Follet and all of them was better, some even exceptional (The Pillars of the Earth). I just hope the third in the sequel will improve the author's reputation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun cool and awesome. you should get it<br />it really has 101 games its awesome in my opinion its awesome

1468161660|5.0|A beautiful heart wrenching EMOTIONAL story,.. a MUST read!!<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has really written the most breath-taking story about Layken and Will, Layken's father passed away and her mum and little brother have moved away to be closer to her mothers new job, (or so Lake thinks), on their arrival she meets a handsome young neighbour Will who she enjoys an amazing first date with, but everything she thought she knew soon gets turned upside down!<br /><br />Get the tissues ready for this one it is my all time favourite series because it converted me from a non-reader into a readaholic! and Point of Retreat the next in the series is even better!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game needs online.its so cool that you get to bould whatever you want.its good thet they atleast put local wifi.i recomend you buying this.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I am a therapist and am usually bored by unraveling stories of \\"family dysfunction\\" so, normally, I would have avoided this.  However, I am also writing a dissertation and finalizing a divorce while passing my 60th birthday.  So!  I find her story of inept but courageous strong-willed persistence with uncertain outcomes to be a wonderful touch point after long days wrangling at the computer.  The catharsis of physical hardship emboldens me.  My book group had mixed reviews, but the like/dislike had more to do with opinions about the life (\\"Why did she throw the second boot away!!!!!\\"), not complaints about the writing.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I loved how Anastasia ended the last book. I thought YES she is finally growing up and sticking up for herself but no! This book was a huge disappoint just as the first one was. I skimmed the whole thing mainly to miss the repetitively boring and immature sexual acts but also to see what everyone is raving about. Turns out, nothing! I won't be buying the third book. I hate that because when I start a trilogy I like to finish them. it gives me satisfaction. However I just can't with this book. Ugh!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|NOTE: THE COMMENT BELOW THAT MENTIONS SPOILERS DOES GIVE SPOILERS TO SEASON SIX AND SEVEN, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE SEASONS, DON'T RUIN IT FOR YOURSELF BY READING THE COMMENT.  So far this season, every show has been intense and you're constantly kept on the edge of your seat. I don't want to give anything away, but those of you who haven't been able to watch Season 7 on Showtime, you will go through a gamut of feelings for Dexter. If you have been collecting the Dexter series, you must purchase this season. You'll love it!
0345803485|2.0|I heard about this book on doctor Oz as a book that spices up the sex lives of adults. I read the reviews on amazon that rave about this book, so I bought and read it. First, this book is so poorly written I was constantly distracted. Second, I felt like I was back in high school all over again. This book borderline grossed me out. I am not a fan of reading about some messed up nympho that prys on younger virgins. Anastasia constantly pisses me off with her whiny childlike behavior. Grow up! I hated the way she let him treat her and the way she thought it was her. By the end of the book I became so excited and proud of her decision only to be more disappointed in the second book, which I had to skim through. I never bought the third book and definitely won't. Good luck.
B008XG1X18|4.0|As a rule, I don't rate software or write reviews about applications I've tried or currently use.  This, however, is my one exception.  In the past, I have avoided any program or application that is even remotely associated with social networking.  Truthfully, I'm pretty sure that when I downloaded Pinterest a month ago I thought it was a photo-management program.  Well, it is that but so much more.  When I finally tapped on the Pintrest icon, I found my world expand exponentially.  However, Pinterest is not a program for everyone.  Pintrest is for people who are intelligent, curious, imaginative, have a sense of humor and love beauty in many forms.  It is an absolute treasure trove for those who like to look outside the box - their box that is - and are open to discovering a world of many shared treasures.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|excellent movie- great action- being fron new england i am very familiar with boston- but did not know its history w/ bankk robbery.  Enjoyed psychological aspect of love story as well as he being aware that what he is doing is wrong and wants out!!!

B004ZISVWC|5.0|This movie was a really well made film. It put forth the effort for good CGI and a good cast. It is definitely worth watching.
0316227706|1.0|I am very disappointed to see a photo of a bulldog in this book!!!  Bulldogs are NOT good swimmers.  Because of their short nose and respiratory system, it is very dangerous for bulldogs to be around pools.  I pray that this book does not give bulldog owners the idea that bulldogs are natural swimmers.  They will drown.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I've been waiting anxiously for a new Stone Sour album and this was worth the wait.  Corey and the gang continue to evolve their music while maintaining the SS sound and feel I love.  I can't wait for part 2 to come out!
B0073U2F2Q|4.0|I wanted to see this in the movie theater, but lacked the chance.<br />I believe it is performed in the truest sense of Science Fiction.<br />I find it compareable to \\"War of the Worlds\\" or \\"The Time Machine\\" done by H.G. Wells.<br />This is not - \\"Die Hard\\", or \\"Alien\\".<br />This was not meant to be an ultra action film. More of a \\"what if...\\".<br />The effects are good, acting is good. Plot is plausible, in the situation as it was presented.<br />The Science behind the sci-fi was equally good. Electric fields and Faraday cages are plausable as well.<br />So, I also consider it a thinking type of Sci-fi.<br />The ending wasa wraped up too quickly - thus the 4 stars.<br />Sequel doubtful.<br />Overall - good, and better than most B-flicks.
B0037KMHRY|1.0|This is a black CD.  That means it will not play on several systems, including my Xbox and PC.  I couldn't hear any of it because it was unreadable.  F.Y.I.
B002NVS25O|5.0|I watch this show with my class at lunch everyday. They love it!  Hilarious characters and we have such a blast watching it together.
0345803507|3.0|This book is good but at times it was hard to read without laughing. I would read parts aloud to my husband and we would share a good laugh. Seriously, who says some of those things? Lol. Anyways, it was not bad but I would not call it one of my favorites.
B004PGO25O|5.0|If you suffer from a little self-doubt, and chronic procrastination,then this book is for you.<br />It's  a launch pad for life!
0525953728|5.0|Great insight on the life of a soldier that I as one my self can relate to it. Weather a Military fan or service member, great read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|What's a review?<br />My dislike about the book is how there is a lot of people who lots a people love who gets killed like Wirres and I thought that there could be only one winner first there were two winners now there are like (this is a spoiler) 8 .<br />What I love about the book is the clock function that was cool and the planning of the (another spoiler) rebellion at the end oh and I really like the tributes from district 4 .
B00821PBIK|5.0|I think that Falling Skies is by far, the best show on tv right now! You really get engrossed in every episode. I personally don't feel that way about anything else on tv.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My only complaint with this game is that it is addictive.  I can play it for hours without even realizing how much time has passed.  My kids just love it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my friend had this on his ipod and he let me play and it was SO ADDICTING!!! 18 19 20
B000CCBCAS|4.0|Awesomely funny, love the Brittish wit, could do with a little less of the F-bombs, though (especially when viewing in the presence of my folks)  Weddings are stressful and this puts fun into the event.<br />RBII
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A lot of people don't like this series and claim it's too much like Harry Potter, Buffy, and Twilight. I actually don't agree. Clare may have borrowed some of the concepts as most writers in the paranormal/supernatural genre do, but she DID NOT steal someone's entire plot as hers was.<br /><br />Amanda Hocking basically stole major chunks and even characters for her own Trylle trilogy and nobody's mentioned that. Read this article [...] and come to your own conclusions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has so much more action compared to the first book. I can't wait to read the final book.
B005CWRB44|5.0|Shipped quickly and shockingly bright!!  I have a lot of different flashlights and this is by far the brightest for its size!  Would recommend it to any of my friends or family.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I haven't played the game much. I am still trying to get use to how it is to be played. Will update review when I get a better understanding.
B001IWV030|5.0|Great cast, hysterical plot, ridiculous twists. I don't know who done it but they did it well. One of my favorites
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Not phenomenally different than any of the other match Three games, but fun enough to play all the way through.
0143106465|5.0|This is my second attempt at reading Emma. When I got it in late August, I got about twenty pages and had to put it down. Now, I picked up where I left off, and I really enjoyed this one. I don't know why I couldn't get through it before. Maybe I was just in the mood for a different genre.<br /><br />Emma is the story of Emma Woodhouse \\"handsome, clever, rich\\". She is also extremely spoiled, and her favorite pastime is making matches for all her friends; pairing them up with men. Her beloved tutor, Miss Taylor, was recently married to Mr. Weston. Now Emma's attention has fallen on Harriet Smith. She pulls Harriet away from Mr. Martin, the man she truly loves, and tries to match her up with Mr. Elton, a wealthy handsome young vicar, with disastrous consequences. That's the main plot.<br /><br />There are several other side-stories: that of Jane Fairfax, an orphan taken in by a friend of her father, Frank Churchill, Mr. Weston's son who was adopted by his uncle, and of course, Emma and Mr. Knightley, a long-standing friend.<br /><br />Emma is a character that you don't like; I kept wishing that she would just mind her own business. Mr. Knightley redeems her a bit; he's smart, and realizes that Emma should not be interfering. But there's not much he can do about it. But he is a great character. Austen's writing is very light and witty, which I enjoyed.<br /><br />I read the Penguin Thread (Deluxe) edition, and I've got to say, it was just beautiful. Seeing the image doesn't do it justice. Penguin uses 3D imaging to scan a woven pattern. So basically, you can feel the stitches on the front of the cover and the back of the cover (and the back side too.) Beautiful, beautiful design, and I look forward to reading some of the other books from this series.<br /><br />Emma was an enjoyable read; though I didn't love it as much as Pride and Prejudice, I definitely liked it more than Northanger Abbey.<br /><br />4.5 stars.<br /><br />You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is the best it is so addicting and it is free but I don't like how they limit how much energy you get but other than that the game is great

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Ugh. I hated this movie. Huge Batman fan here, but not an invested comic nerd who can't accept certain liberty taken upon the comic book mythos. Sigh. I despised this movie deep in my gut. For the record, I never brought Christen Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne. His Bat voice was just annoying, and I loathed the costume. Loathed it.  Nevertheless, let me just talk about this movie. In a nut shell, it's boring, over long, pretentious, and has no internal logic. Yes, even in a comic book / sf world, you need an internal logic. Especially when Nolan goes on record stating this is a \\"Batman in a real world\\". This nonsensicalness is accepted because the false deity Nolan made it. Take off the ruby glasses people. Spoiler Alert>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><br />So Bane breaks Batman's back. Brings him half way around the world, and puts him in some underground prison. A montage of sit-ups, and with the help some eastern yoga guru, his back is fixed. Wow, all that was missing was the playing of \\"Eye of the Tiger\\". He then climbs out of the hole, (with a rope sitting on top, while the prisoners cheer him on) and heads back to Gotham. Meanwhile some cop who is standing in for the the Robin character, is taking down the bad guys by himself. The MacGuffin in the movie, is some computer program thing which can wipe one's history. Though the infrastructure of city is destroyed, so this program would be useless.<br />Batman, who is supposed to be the world greatest detective, not only allows all this chaos to happen, gets duped by Catwoman, at least three times, and by Bane and by Ra's al Ghul's daughter. On his return fight with Bane, he engages him in hand to hand combat again, the same tactic which got his back broken the first time. Now logic would say, that Punch for Punch, Bane is stronger than Batman, so has the world's greast detective you think he would find another method to take him down. Sigh. It just gets sillier. Bombs in the city, car chases,Com Gordon acts like he has superpowers. Not the greatest superhero movie people. Stop the love train on this piece of c...

0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy takes some getting into with lots of characters, mostly fairly unsympathetic middle-aged people with teen-aged kids. Until I had everyone settled in my head, I kept having to go back to remind myself who was who.  Once that was sorted out, the plot moves along and definitely engages the reader, at least this reader.  If you're bothered by casual profanity and strong adult themes-- and I do mean strong, domestic violence, hard drug use, rape, brutal bullying, to name a few-- this is not your book.  All the characters are flawed, some more than others, most are not very nice and some are outright vicious.  Once I got into the book, I really could not put it down, and the complex plot resolved itself satisfactorily although certainly not happily.  It can only be unimaginably difficult for a writer to work with a monkey on her back as enormous as the monumental success of the Harry Potter books; Rowling long ago showed herself to be brilliant at creating deeply unsympathetic characters.  I could have wished that at least a few of the dramatic personae in The Casual Vacancy were a bit more likeable
0393080269|5.0|I loved the book and found it fascinating.  The author was very knowledgeable and gave very useful<br />insights on each country.  I even sent a copy of the book to my investment portfolio manager.
B008RYN44U|3.0|I'll be honest and say that \\"Push And Shove\\" is neither No Doubt's worst effort, nor their best. It's not one star and it's not five. I like to listen to an artist's catalog before reviewing their latest entry. In revisiting all of No Doubt's previous works along with Stefani's two solo outings, it's apparent that they have never quite hit their stride. I remember at the tail end of 1995 when I was working at a Blockbuster Music and a promotional copy of No Doubt's \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" arrived at my store. I took it home to listen to because the cover looked interesting, like something I might want to listen to. I remember thinking that \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" wasn't a great album--I mean a landmark recording. It was overlong and filled with filler. Well, not much has changed. No Doubt have never made a solid album of five star quality. All of their albums have hits, sure, but all of their albums also have annoying filler. In fact, I'd be bold enough to say that both of Stefani's solo albums have the least amount of filler among the lot.<br /><br />So, \\"Push And Shove\\" finds the band doing nothing new. No real risky experimentation here, which is a shame, a wasted opportunity for a roaring comeback. Instead, what you get is a continuation of 2001's \\"Rock Steady\\" mixed with Stefani's solo work. There are tracks here that are pretty good like \\"Settle Down\\", \\"Looking Hot\\", \\"One More Summer\\", \\"Push And Shove\\" and \\"Heaven\\", but the rest is that annoying filler problem. You know what I mean--\\"Easy\\" through \\"Sparkle\\". They all sound the same with little variation. You know it's true, don't lie to yourself, don't give the band a break just because you think they are the greatest band in the world. They're not. They never have been. They are a singles band, as we like to call them. No Doubt make better singles than albums.<br /><br />At this point, I'm not sure the band has the potential to make something amazing. The fact is, they started as a retro band and they have stayed on that course their entire career--not really pushing the limits of what they could be. Instead, they play it safe every album. Could they make a five star ska-influenced rock album that blows everyone's mind, I think they could, but they don't seem to motivated to do so. The only track here that shows what they could have done is the interesting title track. The title track has a thumping beat with a ska rhythm slinking in and out. That track shows some promise, some inventiveness, some attitude and playfulness--which the rest of the album is seriously lacking in.<br /><br />Now, I like No Doubt, but they aren't one of my favorite bands, but now what does the band have to lose by trying to push their limits? I mean it has been 11 years since \\"Rock Steady\\". Most of their audience is gone now except the core followers who might be interested in what the band is up to now. \\"Push And Shove\\" likely doesn't keep the core base hungry for more. As I said, it's good, but not great. Average No Doubt fare. I don't know about any other fans, but I'd rather the band ditch trying to make hits and revert back to their ska/new wave roots and somehow find a way to blend that with a more contemporary sound, and experiment with it, stretch it as far as it can go, bend it, break it, reconstruct it. As far as I can see there are no ska bands right now that are really doing anything interesting with the genre, so why not No Doubt? It's like they've forgotten who they are, and have instead jumped the Pink, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Avril Lavigne, Kelly Clarkson, Carly Rae Jepsen gravy train. The thing is, No Doubt and Gwen Stefani influenced all these latest crop of ladies, and now they/she sound like them rather than turning to something original and fresh and trying to create something newly influential.<br /><br />So, it will be interesting to see if this is it for No Doubt. If they decide to lie down with the dogs and fade to black. Or, will they read any of the critical reviews here and regroup and rethink their future game plan and come roaring back with something they could end their career on and be happy like, say, The Police, another ska/punk influenced classic band? Time will tell.<br /><br />Here is how \\"Push And Shove\\" compares to the band's earlier works:<br /><br />1992 No Doubt: One Star<br />1995 The Beacon Street Collection: Two Stars<br />1995 Tragic Kingdom: Three Stars<br />2000 Return Of Saturn: Three Stars<br />2001 Rock Steady: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Push And Shove: Three Stars<br /><br />Gwen Stefani Solo:<br /><br />2004 Love Angel Music Baby: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 The Great Escape: Three and a Half Starsnd regroup and rethink their future game plan and come roaring back with something they could end their career on and be happy like, say, The Police, another ska/punk influenced classic band?

B007MDB71O|4.0|I read the books so I was happy they made this movie. Could it have been better...yes, but I still enjoyed it and the kids liked it as well. I hope they make the follow up.
0142419303|5.0|This large, glossy, well-made version of \\"Charlie\\" has special 3-D and pop-out illustrations, along with a nice summing up of each chapter, re-telling the story, in Roald Dahl's voice. I teach 2nd Grade, and each day I review the previous day's \\"regular\\" chapter with this wonderful edition. Then I read the next chapter. A terrific addition to the Dahl legacy.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|So far they are doing a great job with this franchise. The story,action and sp. effects are good here.Great flick can't wait for the next one.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|I did not purchase this version of the product because I have no desire to purchase the digital download option for the movie.  I have not seen the movie and do plan to purchase the version without the digital download option.
0439023521|4.0|I saw the movie first and liked it so now I am reading the books. It's a quick read and good story,you definitely can't wait to start book 2 when your done. My one complaint is it seems I can't get through a paperback with out it falling a part these days. All my game of thrones books now this one.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game. Its like Temple Run. I had it connected to Facebook and I was at x29 multiplier and 8th place out of 33 and a score of over 700,000 and I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it because the theme wasn't changing and so then my score got wiped out and now I have to start all over... but I do like the game! I just think that whatever score you get should be saved on your Facebook just in case something like this happens..
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This 'story' can never happen again. In our current world of social media (Facebook, Twitter,Google),no person or event can be hidden or stay un-noticed from the public if it is noteworthy.This story goes beyond noteworthy in oh so many ways. Most of the people writing these reviews have, of course, seen the film. There is no need for me to re-hash their summaries.They are excellent 5 star reviews. I had the good fortune to help with sound for a performance by Rodriguez a few weeks after the film came out. Sold out venue (900) in Washington, DC. What became instantly evident is the man you learn about on the screen is no different from the man off camera. Since I was working the show, I waited until all the other paying patrons went through the meet and greet line before saying hello and thanks. This took about an hour and a half. Rod actually was apologizing to his fans for having to have them wait so long to shake his hand, grab a hug or a picture. The man is 70. And those hardscrabble 70 years have taken their toll on his body as you will see in the film. He needed assistance getting on to and off the stage for this show. Rodriguez may have helped to topple the racist South African apartheid policies. Yet, at 70, this humble shaman lets you know that he is sorry that you had to hang around soo long to say hello.To today's sports stars and politicos: Take heed and learn your lesson here. In conclusion, the cds are great with very fine songwriting. The film is outstanding. Give this to someone you love.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This is what Sci-Fi should be. Great Special effects great cast, great plot that is not obvious or predictable until the end and great villians. A movie that will make you jump in your seat and yell at the screen.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|You know a book (series) is epic when...<br />1. You cannot put it down. Literally. All life around you becomes unimportant. Sleep? Don't need it. Food? Will accommodate as long as you can eat one-handed while holding your Kindle in the other.<br /><br />2. You invest in the characters. You dream of them. You wish you could meet them. You want to be them. You miss them when they are gone. More than you miss your family.<br /><br />3. The story comes to life. You are driving down the street expecting to see a rhino-boy at any moment (or insert fictional creature of your choice).<br /><br />4. You are in love with one of the characters and if he showed up on your doorstep you could die happy. Jericho Z. Barrons. Enough said.<br /><br />5. Even the secondary characters that you know next to nothing about pique your interest so much that you want to stalk the author until she promises to write a book about them and then stalk her until she actually writes it and you have it in your hands.<br /><br />This is what the Fever series did to me. I finished Shadowfever two days ago and I am craving more. I miss Barrons so much. *Sigh* There's not much else to say. I knew it was going to end eventually but still I went through it as fast as I could because I had to find out what was going to happen. As they say, don't cry because it's over, be happy because it happened. I'm happy.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|cant wait for the final book in this series. Have fallen in love with Eva and Gideon. Looking foward to seeing how there love story ends.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Sounds like they went back to the basics and just had fun. A few songs even reminded me of the Ramones.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This collection of The Piano Guys songs is wonderful!  Since I've seen all the videos, I can picture the Star Wars fights in the \\"Cello Wars\\" song.  My favorite is \\"Peponi.\\" I like it even better than ColdPlay's \\"Paradise.\\"  If you like The Piano Guys, you will love this CD!
B008NEMPTO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! The 3D is great just like many other reviewers have said, it adds alot to the movie. The fight scenes were fantastic and I think that is where the 3D worked the best, it was also cool watching the little pieces of dust fly in 3D. I have never read the book and have never even heard of it before until reading the reviews on here. I thought the story line of the movie was really good though. The actor that plays Abraham looks alot like him in my opinion, so that really added alot to the movie. There were a few nice twists in the story that keeps everything entertaining. I think it is definitely worth checking out especially in 3D, and if you do get to see it in 3D, check out the vamps eyes!
B0062O85IW|4.0|Very good reference material.  I think even a pretty experienced Excel user could pick up some good tips.  I would recommend it.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|it was an excellent sequel to the origional. lots of action and a decent plot. i really liked the urban camo. hope they make more of em.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A well-developed game that has more than the simple line three-of-a-kind going on. Four stars only because of stability issues, but the game is easy enough to conquer that it's not devastating to have to reinstall. I hope bug fixes continue to come so I haven't hesitated to recommend this game as worth the $ to friends.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was wonderful. A true work of art. Can't wait to read the next book in the series. I recommend it highly, great read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a good app for all ages. my kid loves it. nice way to exercise your brain power specially the hardest level
B008AX1HD8|5.0|Really disappointing when I finished Jo's last book 'The Phantom', realising that maybe that's the end of the series - but now along comes his first one -'The Bat' which fills in the unknowns of Harry Hole's often referred to early times, his true love Birgitta and how he earned his reputation as a serial killer dectective. Wow - really loved it - on a par with 'The Snowman'. I don't normally read a book twice but this one I will! I 'rank' my own reads and have never awarded 10/10 but this one made 9.5! But tell me something - how can we get Jo to serve us up a new Harry Hole ? Come on Jo - give us another - pleeese!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game this game is very addicting too.I also love this game because it just keeps going and going.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I use Tune in radio pro every day!!!  Love this app!!  Only desire would be for connection not to drop and since I payed for the app would like to save to HD  and use on multi devices.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|free and fun to play! what more do you need? works great on my kindle fire. easy for my kids to play too.
0786888628|5.0|An excellent book about the Forgotten War, both factual and engrossing as a story. There should be a lot more books on this subject.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|A good campy film and enjoyable if you are a Johnny depp fan then worth buying pretty close to the series and in keeping it in the seventies genre made it worthwhile
1589946901|5.0|I have been looking to get into blood bowl for years, but had a hard time finding the miniatures online and affording them.  This game came along and I quickly picked it up.<br /><br />This game offers you six teams to play with, as you are a general manager trying to come up with the best match ups to increase your star power.<br /><br />There is a mix of strategy and luck involved in this game and getting the right cards to improve your match ups.<br /><br />It is a quick play (under and hour) once you get the rules down and is a blast with two people.  I have yet to play with more than that, but hoping to soon.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great card game with a good theme that is fast and fun to play, pick it up.  It's less than thirty bucks!
0307383415|1.0|It's too bad that he has admitted to having \\"composites\\" in this book. For those of you who don't understand what that is, it means some of it never happened. One of them is when he talks about his mom being called stanley steamer when she was a kid. Stanley Steamer didn't become that until the 1970's. His mom was a kid in like the fifties.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I just love this movie.  Even though there are many things left out from the book, this was a great movie.  Can't wait for Catching Fire to come to the screen!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This is a very enjoyable game but somewhat too easy. There are plenty of levels to enjoy and the price point is great.
B008NNNF7G|4.0|I love this album. It's fun, catchy and hands down, the best I have downloaded in a long time. Definitely my new favorite!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|the film itself is brilliant.  It is not a direct prequel to alien it is the origin of the xenomorph species.  the film gives you a few direct answers to questions that fans have been debating for decades.  but it's brilliance really comes through by asking more questions that us hardcore fans will be debating for a few more decades.  Overall though if you're not a fan of the alien franchise and haven't seen Alien you will be completely lost, there is no back-story or hand holding you get dumped in the film and off you go.<br />the blue-ray looks excellent and if you get the 4 disc collector's edition you get a really insightful doc about the film.<br /><br />I love the alien franchise as much as a Trekkie loves star trek.  this film and blu-ray is great.<br /><br />A must buy for all Weyland-Yutani employees.
1582701709|5.0|Good information. So glad i found it. Words to live by, practice what you preach. I highly recommend this one.
B003AXAS60|5.0|great, price was good, grand child loves the toy. would order more of these items if he shows an interest in them
0470876417|5.0|I enjoyed working through this book. The various aspects using the model to create a meaningful Business Plan that satisfies all the groups associated are lucidly explained in the book. It is probably the best book on the subject I read.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|I really liked Morph The Cat!  It had more of the Steely Dan sound than his previous (funk/jazz) Kamakiriad album and the songs had a really nice breeze to them.  It was just more catchy, better songs, better production! Sunken Condos just doesn't do anything for me.  It starts off ambitious enough with Slinky Thing, this is the style I like Fagen to be doing! I'm Not The Same Without You is pleasant too but it's sounding a bit too much the same as other songs he has done in the past. Memorabilia is really boring, it's the same tone over and over throughout the entire song with the rephrase repeated again and again and again!  Weather In My Head gets worse, super boring and generic.  Again the same tempo over and over, the song never changes, same instruments, reprise, terrible!  The New Breed, Out Of The Ghetto, Miss Marlene, and Good Stuff are all just poorly written songs and boring musical pieces that have the Donald's Fagen sound and style but sound totally uninspired! The album ends with Planet D'Rhonda which is a pretty good song I like the guitar work at the end! This is his worse solo album other than Kamakiriad which I don't like because of the style.  This album I don't like because most the songs stink!  I've heard the album 5-6 times and I don't wan't to hear it again.  It doesn't stick with me, it isn't catchy, it isn't fun or lively!  Now don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with the voice, you can't tell his age at all from his voice.  But other than perhaps a few decent songs, this one is a loser for me!
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Hunger Games series keeps you entertained at every turn of the page.<br />The love triangle of survival is a real draw card. A must read by everyone. Fantastic!!
B0098VYCCE|5.0|after seeing only 3 stars, we chose to watch the movie and we did like it a lot. cool effects, nice story, great acting, costumes, camera, music.... well, what else would u want? have fun!!!!
B00117S4GS|2.0|Like so many modern TV shows, they feature actors with the right \\"look\\", but no acting ability. Put actors such as these into a story line with nothing really to do and you have a waste of 45 minutes.
034580404X|5.0|After all the hype about these books I purposely kept my expectations neutral. After reading them twice, I must say the story held my interest. It is not a grossed out sex plot that is portrayed in some reviews. I rather enjoyed the story behind the sex and how the main characters adjusted their lives to adjust to their Nature vs. Nurture feelings for each other.<br /><br />As with reading any new Arthurs books, I had to get use to Ana's subconscious, but by the end enjoyed her thoughts as well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book as a good read and for good discussions.<br /><br />Last, if you did happen to be a Twilight fan and read the Twilight books prior to reading these, you can see Robert Pattinson and Twilight's warm thoughts all poured into these books. This is a good thing because I like Robert Pattinson. From the colors of Ana's clothes, Christian's personality, jealousy, possessiveness, the fascination with cars, the twilight view from their new home, the gentleman he is and many other verses from the books. Ana is Bella. Clumsy,  tom-boy in dressing and so naive.<br /><br />If and when the movie comes out. They really should think of Robert Pattinson as Christian. After Cosmopolis, I think he could play the part.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|Not as good as the others he has written.  The characters didn't seem very compelling.  I read it all anyway but was slightly disappointed.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is probably the most comprehensive and well written nutritional study I have ever read. The science is sound and extensive. The references of the scientists behind it are impecable. It establishes beyond a shadow of a doubt the fact that what we eat influences our health directly, not only from a preventative point of view but also as a means of curing illness. A must to read!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|A smooth easy to use calculator.  So smooth and simple it's better than other handhelds.  But the best nice touch is the memory of commands.  Lists in order all entries, and saves it forever so you can go back if you screwed up or you  see what entries you did a week ago.  I am a little OCD and like to remember things like that, you know, just in case, so I thought that was great.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|[...]    Over the past half decade or so, Bruce Timm and company have done an amazing job of creating these DTVs. Ranging from completely original stories to adaptions of popular story, so it was no surprise that The Dark Knight Returns was one of the most highly requested films for the group. With much joy, and a little reservation, we finally get The Dark Knight Returns. A story so dense that it becomes the first film adaption to warrant two separate DTVs!  The Dark Knight Returns retains the style of the comic book fairly well. Which is both a blessing and a curse. The style loans itself to animation well as we've seen in both Batman: The Animated Series and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, but it's also not a style I'm personally too keen on. Well that is a bit strong, I really don't care for the overly bulky Batman design that this book used. It's just not a style that makes sense, and not many characters actually retain it. It really stands out when Batman is interacting with the new Robin in this film. His hands are also as large as her body!  My dislike for the art-style aside, the film does animate and look fantastic in motion. Some of the more memorable moments, and especially some of the fights, look extremely wonderful when animated. Some of the shots for shots from the comics feel a little forced in motion, but it was cool to see that they included all of the iconic moments (from the first half at least) while building around them.  I'd be honest, I haven't read the actual source material in nearly a decade so when I tell you it follows the story pretty straight-forward, I'm only going off of what I remembered. I'm sure there was stuff cut, but I couldn't point you to exact moments or pieces of dialog off the top of my head. I have read enough Frank Miller stuff to know that almost all of Batman's internal monologues had been cut from the film. Though, as a rule, a character speaking in their head isn't as easy to convey in animation. It's really a comicbook thing.  The writing on the other hand is a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it, I will chalk up to the source material. Frank Miller is a lot of things, but the most elegant writer he is not. A lot of the dialogue comes off as a bit hokey or stilted not only in their delivery, but just how they are phrased. Granted, I'm sure some of it is a product of the era. Slang from the 80s probably hasn't carried over well nearly 30 years later!  On the bright side, the voice cast they got for this film is top-notch. While I have already expressed my love for Kevin Conroy as Batman, Peter Weller (Robocop!) as an elderly Batman/Bruce Wayne though knocks the performance out of the park. He just works so well for me, and he has a voice that is kind of serious and gravely without coming off as a bit of parody (still love you Bale!). And it's not just Weller who shines in this cast, David Selby as Commissioner Gordon and Michael Jackson as Bruce's loyal butler, Alfred, are perhaps have some of the best parts in the movie for me. Alfred is his usual dry self, but he does it with such charm that it is endearing. Selby brings a nice warmth, but toughness to Gordon, who is now up there in age, but dealing with a more reformed Gotham.  The rest of the cast does a decent job, but aren't giving as much screen-time to work with aside from Ariel Winter as Carrie Kelley, the new Robin. I think she does a great job in the role, but there's nothing in this film that makes me believe that she should have been Robin. The whole idea of Robin has always been a bit of a stretch since Batman deals with really bad people. When Carrie first dons the costume, which is just a Halloween costume, we see her come off a bit clumsy and reckless to the point where you fear she may get herself killed. The fact that she is able to take down the Mutant Leader, or at least distract him long enough for Batman to do his thing, seems a bit contrived from what little we had seen of her up until that point. Yes, muchlike any Robin, she eventually does get training from Batman, but she hadn't earned much up to that point!  Which brings us to the final point, the actual story in the movie. If you've read the comic, you pretty much know all the beats. We're about a decade out from the last sighting of the Batman. Gotham is in relative peace aside from a new gang calling themselves The Mutants, and Bruce is dealing with his life beyond the cape. Slowly, the pieces of the peace start to fall aside as the return of an old foe, Two-Face, triggers some events that leads to the return of Batman. Batman does battle with the mutants, which eventually escalates to an all-out assault planned on Gotham City.  That's pretty much the extent of the plot. A lot of the political undertones from the source material have been removed from the adaption, though you still get discussion on whether or not Batman is better or worst for society.  Ultimately, it is an odd talking point since a lot of this is focused on Batman and you see how much good he does for Gotham, but it also does mean he tends to bring out the wack jobs...  And that's where The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 leaves off, it is a very smartly done cliffhanger. You are given a really solid movie from start to finish. It has a complete plot, but it dangles a very juicy carrot in front of you so that you will check out Part 2 when it drops next year. Sadly, I wish they would have been able to time the two releases closer together!
B00932HEX2|5.0|This pilot show really grabbed my attention right from the start.  Just when you figure out the plot, they change it up and you think it's the other guy. Great new show and I can't wait for season 2!

B003MVJG8Q|1.0|Bought the card. Installed it according to the instruction sheet. Plugged the hardrive power plug into the jack on the card.<br />Powered up the computer and the device was not recognized. Instructions indicated driver must be downloaded from web - no CD with card.  Went to website given in the instructions, download the appropriate driver and the device still was not recognized. After an hour of installing and removing various versions of drivers, I found the 3.0.20.x driver worked.<br />Of course, that driver is not for this card, but, for a similar Transcend card. Transcend get your act together. Mistakes happen, but, I'm sure someone has reported this to Transcend and they have not fixed it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I put off using pinterest for a long time. Finally caved when it became an app that I was able to use on my Kindle. Love this app! I haven't had a whole lot of problems with it.

B007HGPBRC|4.0|This review is for the Kindle edition of the book. I have heard and read about Christopher Hitchens, but have never read his work. This is his autobiographical account of the end of his life after diagnosis and during treatment for esophageal cancer. Hitchens is an outspoken atheist and it is interesting to read as he remembers his life and faces its end with courage in his conviction that there is nothing further for him. He does a good job of enumerating the difficulties inherent in the treatment of this serious disease, and its effect not only on himself but also on his family and the people who know him. Unfortunately, his course after diagnosis was brief, and the end of the book is comprised of short notes and thoughts, followed by an afterward by his wife. Hitchens lived hard, and by his own admission earned his cancer, and he offers no apology for his behavior as he regrets the truncation of his life. It is an affecting if brief memoir, and I recommend it as a chronicle of illness and death seen unsparingly through the eyes of the affected person, regardless of the theological implications of Hitchens' atheism.

B008AS5UAO|3.0|I like this recording. I would love to like it more. Sonically, it is great. But there is very little energy. It seems fine when I listen to it on its own, but then I had a listen-fest with Mitropolous, Furtwangler (1953 M&A and the EMI), Krips on Decca and a few others. Honestly, I like the soundstage less than Krips (stereo). The performances fall short on all counts. From the get-go all others have more drama than this. If you need modern sound, go Gardiner, Davis, or Karajan with Ramey. But I can assure you, Krips, Mitroupolous, and Furtwangler all surpass this by miles, and in most cases the sound deficiencies are negligible.

Enhorabuena Don Murray, una vez más, te has superado. Los temas, por supuesto, magníficos; el tema 6 \\"La By Bike\\" es, para mi gusto, el mejor. Se agradecen las colaboraciones de músicos tan importantes como George Duke, Vinnie Colaiuta, Dave Grusin, Marcus Miller y muchos más. Sólo digo, que es indispensable tener este disco.

B0000C3I6U|5.0|I was just a little boy reading a 1980's issue of Ironman Magazine. They featured in an article a look back to Pumping Iron documentary film. Growing up in the Philippines and a third world country you really cannot find a copy of this film. I was then so amazed by the bodybuilding sport. Not just the body sculpting but the discipline and nutrition, the research studies, and pretty much getting healthy and ageless throughout the years. Hey look at them at the present time now, especially Lou and Franco. Arnold himself, what an achievement! Now I am 37 years old trying to workout again and my best motivation...The 25th Anniversary Special Edition of Pumping Iron. To be honest when I watch the VHS copy of this film long time ago, I saw the future of gyms getting crowded, dance studios, people buying excercise videos, home gyms, excercise equipments etc. Now I received the DVD from Amazon and watched it several times already. What can I say... I need to get back to pumping iron again. Get your copy from Amazon especially if you were from their era...and get in shape, it does not mean you need to be a bodybuilder. A great video documentary from the Golden Age of Bodybuilding. An amazing motivational factor!
B000YXMMAE|5.0|End to end, this is the most perfect album I have ever come across. I once heard it described as \\"More than music, this is a 3D landscape of sound\\", perfect.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I was skeptical about this game but was pleasantly surprised. It is a great upgrade from the classic bejeweled. The story is Meh but the cut scenes are cool and give some purpose to the game. It gets very tough by the end.
1592332803|4.0|I purchased this book after reading other reviews and am pleased with it so far. I have made the corn muffins, coffee cake, pumpkin bread and oatmeal cookies. The cookies were a hit with the whole family and my personal favorite is the coffee cake, so moist and delicious! I would highly recommend this book.
0307592731|5.0|I expected the book to be about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, with funny stories about the mishaps of a hiking beginner, but I was absolutely astoneded at the authors ability to be so honest about her emotional state; how she got there and how she walked her way out of it. It takes more bravery to honestly reveal so much about ones self than it does to sleep out on the trail.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|What a delightful book!  You know that Harold suffered great loss when he started his pilgrimage, but you can't imagine what it was.  He and his wife are two lonely individuals who are suffering and have shut each other out.  In the end there is hope for everyone.  Well-written!

B008LY9AWG|4.0|The stories were well written but a little too short.  I am a BIG Micheal Connelly fan and used to his full length books.  Classic Connelly style but left you wanting more.
B006XOBFB0|4.0|I adore Klimt. Perhaps only Horace can rival him in his ability to celebrate our transience - our daily blazes of being - whilst the forces of disintegration, nothingness and oblivion edge ever closer like the predators they are. Klimt's love of gold is no accident. However illusionary our kingship might be, we are sovereigns; and how quickly it passes away.<br /><br />Over time, many a designer has turned to Klimt to provide the likes of Mahler, Schoenberg and Berg with a front-cover for one of their compositions. It's an easy kill. I staunchly maintain that Mozart merits the same treatment if not more so. That is not to say that his music should be overly romanticised (if at all). But no-one is more sapient than Mozart - no-one. No matter how courtly they might be, each one of his concertos is a carnival of life and humanity. In doing so, they are framed by the same adversaries that besotted Klimt. At times, Mozart addresses the abyss directly. The singer and his song \\"O, Come Sweet May, and make the trees green again,\\" will come to an end and the rest is not even silence.<br /><br />I have never connected with Murray Perahia. The failing could be mine. I must be the only dude on the planet who does not kowtow to his Goldberg Variations. I am equally mystified by his Schubert. For years, I scratched my noggin whenever this highly acclaimed cycle came to mind. It was only upon the advent of [[ASIN:B0038AMC0K Mozart Piano Concertos: The Complete 78rpm Studio Recordings 1933-47]] in my life that MP's placement in the scheme of things became less unclear.<br /><br />Everything here in this Sony cycle is accomplished and poetic. There is no narcissism. This is Mozart played as Mozart, not as Telemann, Haydn or Beethoven. The virtuosity displayed by soloists and orchestra alike is laudable. None of these recordings is (particularly) state of the art and the 24-bit remastering has optimised their impact. And yet I never sense that Murray and his accomplices are `betting the house'.  I don't detect any desperation. They're not a communiqu&eacute; from Sinai - there's no transfer of kergyma. These are performances to enjoy and cherish, not `postcards from the edge'.<br /><br />Fischer and others offer contrast. One wonders whether the great Swiss-German pianist will make it out alive in K 491. It takes a Lipatti to parry oblivion in the great C Major Concerto, K 467 but do it he does ([[ASIN:B000063UN6 Piano Concertos]]).<br /><br />Quite rightly, Sony will never allow this cycle to fall out of print. It will be continually revamped with new technology. Until the end of our days, Murray Perahia will regale us in his shiny suits. But I bet you a penny to a pound that Sony will never call upon the services of one Gustav Klimt in reissuing this cycle to the market.<br /><br />Style and substance do not equate to gnosis.the house'.

1451696191|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one book that will never leave me. I consider myself a book nerd and as a book nerd I connect to books with incredible intensity, but I have never connected with a book like I have with this one. First of all, I found the writing relatable and easy for people of all reading levels to read and understand. The main character, Charlie, has such a distinct voice and to read everything going on in his mind was massively refreshing since he is so unique. Besides that, I think the plot and morals of the story are inspiring and can truly help people through rough times. This book made me feel like I had someone that understood me and I think that's something so many young people (even older people) need. Overall, I think this is an excellent story. I would recommend it to anyone of any age because the story, the characters, the emotions, the struggles; they're all so universal and relatable. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.

B002JIOQCO|4.0|When every member but frontman/founder Andrew Stockdale exited the band in 2008, two years after performing on 2006's full-length, self-entitled debut, many thought the end of Wolfmother was near. Not so. Stockdale recruited two new, very competent musicians in bassist Ian Peres (who also plays keyboards) and drummer Dave Atkins. The band's rhythm section was also completed and made fuller and better-sounding with the addition of a rhythm guitarist named Aidan Nemeth. And with this new band in tact, the Australian four-piece released a sophomoric full-length effort in 2009, \\"Cosmic Egg.\\" As a result, their Seventies/Eighties-worshipping hard rock/heavy metal sound (which is heavily influenced by the likes of Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Deep Purple, UFO, Rainbow, Dio, Pentagram, and Jethro Tull) is not only present, here, it sounds as sharp as ever. Simply put, on \\"Cosmic Egg,\\" Wolfmother sound more Wolfmother-y than ever before.<br /><br />With its \\"Ace Of Spades\\"-era Motorhead-esque bass intro and propulsive, swinging bass grooves, \\"California Queen\\" is bass propelled-opener -- although it does make plenty of room for some unexpectedly shrieky, whammy-bar-guitar soloing and Robert Plant-meets-Chris Cornell-esque vocals. By doing so, Wolfmother created an insanely catchy, feel-good, and nearly-danceable modern hard rock classic. Although not quite as irresistible as the above, lead single \\"New Moon Rising\\" is a keeper because it marries bluesy, bottom-heavy, Tony Iommi-derived riffing, tasty wah-pedal licks and more propulsive and powerful bass lines with bluesy, Southern-tinged crooning and memorable melodic choruses. \\"White Feather,\\" despite mostly playing like a full-on White Stripes ode, does retain some catchy, bobbing guitar hooks and a pulsing bass throb. And it is all capped off by more memorable vocals and lyrics, as well as a terrifically epic, wailing, 40-second long solo to cap it all off, too.<br /><br />The really tasty, Tom Morello-inspired \\"wah-wah\\" guitar licks of \\"Sundial\\" hooks the listener into a deep, crunching guitar/bass groove. Meanwhile, the guitarists are ripping out UFO-styled unorthodox, shredding solos. The tune does retain some melody, though, as some cool, jazzy piano keys and soaring melodic choruses are sprinkled into the mix, too. Next up, aside from featuring some acrobatic soloing in the background, and a strong, prominently grumbling bass bottom that flows along with the whole song, \\"In The Morning\\" actually plays mostly like a pretty, laid-back, Beatles-esque ballad. But this is then followed up by perhaps the heaviest song on the record, the thunderous \\"10,000 Feet,\\" which features a wealth of surprisingly metallic and viscerally satisfying, chunky, grinding, Sabbath-y, pure doom riffage. And it is all augmented by a strong, chugging bass line.<br /><br />Two later tracks, the title song and \\"In The Castle,\\" both play like oh-so-Iron Maiden-ish tunes, with their rhythmic, galloping grooves, simple, chugging licks, powerful bass bottom, and terrific, shredding solos. And if that weren't enough, the latter of these tunes also features an extremely trippy, proggy intro, dramatic-sounding drum rolls, and noteworthy lyrics. (It deals with power metal-type fantastical storytelling about going places \\"that you have never been,\\" etc.) \\"Far Away\\" is the perfect accompaniment to these two tracks in that it is a very psychedelic power ballad with nicely melodic bass lines, a wailing, classical-sounding piano line, and Stockdale doing his best Ozzy Osbourne impression (if Ozzy's nads were in a vice, that is). A whopper, crunching stoner metal eventually kicks in, though, taking things into much heavier territory.<br /><br />And \\"Pilgrim\\" is great continuation of THAT song because it, too, features some big, sludgy, distorted, hard rocking, deeply grooving Sabbath-meets-Zeppelin guitar and thundering bass riff slices. And some Jimi Hendrix-inspired licks and a bout of surprisingly blistering solos are also included, here. Then, following the nearly five-minute long exercise in exceptional soloing that practically makes your fingers itch to play along with on air-guitar (\\"Phoenix\\"), comes the album's fittingly very progressive and epically epic closer, \\"Violence Of The Sun.\\" It is a six-minute long closer centered around siren-like guitar melodies and deft, crashing cymbals. Sure, the odd big, doomy power chord occasionally comes smashing through, making its arrangements heavy and momentous -- but only occasionally.<br /><br />In conclusion, it may have taken an overlong amount of time (three years) to produce, but with this album, Wolfmother have definitely created a very worthy follow-up to their eponymous debut. \\"Cosmic Egg\\" may not take many huge -- or even substantial -- musical leaps and bounds for the Australian band, but it is definitely a hugely enjoyable and memorable, hard rocking good time. As such, it is easy to recommend all Seventies/Eighties revivalists, and fans of hard rock/heavy metal, in general.los are also included, here.

B008XBCJ34|4.0|I saw this is 3D in the theaters and thought at the time that the film's 3D was good, but I was just never blown away, no matter how much people praised it (same for the story, actually).  I had hopes for the recent home version because I have discovered that many times films I saw in 3D in theaters looked better in Blu-ray over an HDTV.  But, honestly, I felt the same lack of thrill with the Fox 3D Blu.<br /><br />Some moments are good and show depth, but so many times I wasn't sure I had it on 3D settings and had to check.  There were only a tiny few moments when I felt anything coming out of the screen, and these proved to be \\"leaves\\" after the great tree explosion.<br /><br />Audio, on the other hand, was a definite 5 out of 5.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I love Johnny Depp, and I like Depp/Burton collaborations. (Not all, Alice In Wonderland and Charlie and Chocolate Factory were extremely bad in my personal opinion.)I followed the IMDB news since November, and I won pre screening tickets via a radio contest. The movie was good, not quite like the original show but then it'd be hard to cram years worth of 20 min daily soap opera into a two hour movie. The movie did not exceed my expectations, or meet them, but the movie was good. The makeup for Barnabas is a little extreme but I understood the look they were going for. The jokes were generally funny, not all but enough to keep me entertained. There are some plot holes, and I still don't see the chemistry between Victoria and Barnabas but what movie doesn't? The costumes were fun and Alice Cooper was nice. The beginning ten minutes were amazing, and the end fight scene was good. There is definitely room for a sequel, too.<br />Watch it for yourself. I liked the movie, but if you don't like Burton/Depp humor or movies, don't see it.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The item arrived on time, and works just fine. I have used it in a few YouTube videos, and the sound is very clear. These mics are very sensitive, and will pick up sound from other things nearby, so make sure you are recording in a nice, quiet area. There is a very slight hum in the finished recording, but if you have even half decent software, you can remove the noise in post production. The audio is very crisp, and the mic is nice and small. I would recommend this mic to anyone who needs a small, inexpensive mic for doing videos, or live presentations. If you are looking for a professional mic that will have noise cancelling and all that, then you will spend over $100 easy. This one is good for someone looking to have very good sound quality, and is willing to do a little cleanup in the final mix. I am very happy with my purchase, and would gladly buy this item again.<br /><br />Here is a link to one of the vids I recorded with this mic:[...]

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm a fairly new fan of \\"The Piano Guys\\".  My son introduced me to them last year and I can't get enough of them.  My favorite way to listen to this CD is driving down the highway.  But I have a link to the YouTube version of \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" on my Kindle so I can listen AND WATCH it anytime I want.  So talented and so entertaining! I was very excited to learn about and order this CD.

B005HEWK1Q|5.0|The crew is on an away mission on a planet they are gathering food supplies.  There is another ship in orbit around the planet and the alien ship is shielded. Voyager uses a burst of power to expose a Kazon ship.<br /><br />As the crew begins to quickly beam up for safety reasons they realize that Ensign Seska is missing.  Chakotay is looking for her in a cave and sees Kazons walking around. The Kasons shoot Chakotay as he and the ensign shoot both of them. The Voyager leaves orbit but Chakotay was injured as is recovering in sick bay.<br /><br />Shorty later the Kazon ship sends out a distress call.  The voyager responds but finds only one survivor on board as they appear to have been killed while testing a Federation piece of technology.  How did they get it......<br /><br />It appears that the crew of the Voyager may have a traitor on board and Tuvok and Chakotay begin an investigation.  Can it be that a trusted member of the crew is really selling Federation technology?  This is a really good story and the action begins to pick up in this episode.  I recommend it to you as a one worth watching.
1439152802|5.0|I leave the detailed reviews to others and will just simply say that this book is a keeper! I started it last night and finished it this morning over coffee. The characters are still with me and I keep replaying parts of the story over again and again in my mind.  The author writes extremely well and her characters are so real they seem to be performing their parts in the intricate storyline right before me as in a play. Give yourself a gift and read this book! Nuff said.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Without giving too much away, the 23rd installment in the James Bond film series, \\"Skyfall\\" opens with a terrific, fast-paced action sequence in Istanbul employing 4 wheel drives, motorbikes, trains and a Cat digger.  A hard drive containing the names of agents embedded with terrorist cells has been stolen; agents have died, more will die and M (Judi Dench) is being scapegoated.  But not only is M's job at stake, but so is her life.  Bond's mission: retrieve the drive, save M, save England and the world.  His accomplices include a fresh faced new quartermaster whose arrival is explained by events in the first half hour of the movie (played by Ben Whishaw) (Layer Cake; Perfume), and a stunning and capable female agent (played by Naomie Harris) (28 Days Later, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), whose true identity is only revealed at the end.  Rory Kinnear, reprising his role as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner, the creepy villian, Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem)(No Country For Old Men; Biutiful), his employee and Bond's short-lived love interest Severine (the beautiful Berenice Marlohe) and M's politician boss Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes) are all excellent players, but even Daniel Craig's moody Bond cannot detract from the real star - the iron lady of British intelligence.<br /><br />Getting back on the horse after a near-death experience proves more difficult for 007 then he imagined.  Q may have presented him with a special new Walther PPK, but what good is that when Bond can no longer shoot straight?  He's out of shape, he's got shrapnel in his shoulder and, as M reminds him, in desperate need of a shave.  How can he hope to compete with Silva, a former agent who, well funded by selling his services to the highest bidders, has been plotting his cruel revenge against M and the agency since 1997?  Mallory asks Bond why he didn't just \\"stay dead\\", but he already knows the answer.  Silva will stop at nothing to kill M, and Bond is not just going to let that happen.<br /><br />Bond follows the man whole stole the drive to Shanghai, where he first spots Severine by chance.  When they next meet in Macau, she is afraid - not of him, but of the sadistic Silva - who not only has penetrated MI6's secure firewall, but commands a wide range of inventive ways to wreak havoc.  Silva admonishes Bond and MI6 for being out of touch with the present.  But Bond proves that, even with the latest technology, you just can't beat some old fashioned tools of the trade - a knife, a sawed-off shotgun and an Aston Martin DB Mark III.  And as he admits to Silva in their first meeting, resurrection is Bond's forte.<br /><br />Most of the story takes place in the UK - in London (including subterranean) and the mist-covered Scottish moors.  And there, in Scotland, is Bond's childhood home and the games keeper Kincade, played with quiet dignity by Albert Finney.  The grand, but derelict stately home - the secret it holds - and the defense Bond and Kincade mount against overwhelming odds - offers more evidence that sometimes older is better.<br /><br />However, at the end, we get glimpses of the future - which will feature in the next installment of the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games on my kindle. This game  electrifies anyone who plays it. This is truly addictive and amazing.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I like the features that it has compared to the other headsets out there  from other companies. These have a list!<br />-Bass Booster<br />-Chat Booster (for when the game gets too loud it turns up the chat volume but it can get annoying at times and you cannot turn it off)<br />-Chat and Game Volume.<br />-Compatible with all gaming systems (Just for PC, Xbox, And PS3 so its all around)<br /><br />Theyre a good headset for those features. But my problem is that they break too often! Ive had to replace mine 3 times already for the same problem. so I finnaly got tired of it and deciding to buy a wireless bluetooth mic from Microsoft.<br /><br />Overall they're Great. But if you get them, be ready to have all shipping information needed for repairs. Oh and get ready to pay too because they won't pay for you.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I read the first book shortly before the 2nd book came out and could barely wait to see where the story went. I can't put my finger on what in the 2nd book left me disappointed other than I was confused thru most of it as to where it was going. When I read the first one I ended up re-reading it just because I missed the story - didn't feel that way about the 2nd one. I had already pre-ordered the 3rd and I'll read it to see what happens next. Just hoping for more of the interaction between the 2 main characters in the next one. They seemed too apart for too much of this story for me.
B009VB97EY|4.0|Confession.  I rented this movie to take a peek at Channing Tatum's physique, and mighty fine it is.  However it caught me by surprise how much I enjoyed the movie.  It has a sweet story line and the acting was top notch.<br /><br />Not a bad way to spend Friday evening--if you know what I mean ladies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has a variety of games so you can chose the game you like best in one app. its easy to find and beats downloading a bunch of apps.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My few game apps are all word games but saw this and decided to give it a try.  It is really a fun diversion and the higher levels can be challenging.  My son just downloaded it on his new Windows 8, and other son has it on his iphone.
B009B0CZXU|4.0|Bare, compelling tunes that leave Ms. khan out there more than ever.  There isn't the musical depth as her last album, that put her in a more electronic goth vein, but every song holds up well, even if a bit too sparse at times.<br /><br />This album reminded me of the Hounds of Love by Kate Bush, with similar atmospherics and lyrical depth, without the tacky 80s synth element, of course.  Khan is a true artist.<br /><br />If there's any criticism it's that her voice might need a little more music to fill in the empty spaces many of these songs evoke.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As a long time Pillars of the Earth fan disappointed by World Without End the Century Trilogy was a nice surprise. I tend to skim reviews while considering buying or not so...<br /><br />Cons are:<br />Typical character development of a Follet book. No spoilers, but little things like choices characters make or their attitude and even physical descriptions are similar to previous works. Plot development can be familiar as well. Can be distracting and lack creativity but to me was not overwhelmingly so.<br />Too much foresight, heavy handed foreshadowing. The story flows through well-known history and the characters confusingly switch between naivete and uncanny foresight while navigating the events they're caught up in. Knowing \\"winks\\" to the reader while a character considers the future can be a bit cheesy.<br />Politics discussed are pretty biased, \\"good\\" characters are more progressive and \\"bad\\" characters are either against change or in favor of radical change away from freedom. Obviously a theme from the time frame but can be a bit overly simplistic.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Huge historical events that shaped our modern world are humanized and personalized in a way I haven't seen before for the time frame. Much like Pillars of the Earth this book brings to life what was previously just dry text in a history book or a black and white photograph. Fascinating levels of detail, invaluable insight into the Lost and the Greatest Generations.<br />The character storyline blends with history well, neither overshadows or relies too heavily on the other.<br /><br />Overall just a great read I think is worth it in both education and entertainment value. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in history, politics, or the world around us in general.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons have done what very few artists have been able to do in the recent decade. These songs are heartfelt and honest and real. For once, a band sounds like they are playing for the love of music. \\"Babel\\", \\"I Will Wait\\", and \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" are three of the best songs on the album. My favorite line of the entire album is in \\"Babel\\": \\"I cry Babel, Babel! Look at me now!\\" He sounds so real; he manages the same effect in the entire album. Congrats to Mumford & Sons for another amazing album!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|This work is a disjointed and nonsensical treatment of a grubby English small town.  It is impossible to like anyone.
1593081545|5.0|Jane Austen's writing, in my opinion, allowed woman to speak their mind.  Her writing of society and balls being drab and the heroine wanting to break away from what a woman should be is feminism.  The heroine enjoyed taking longer walks than they \\"should.\\"  They didn't succumb to petty giggling and gossips.<br /><br />Fanny Price is all this and more in \\"Mansfield Park.\\"  She isn't afraid to talk about politics and slavery.  Something woman at this time didn't discuss with men.  But Fanny does.<br /><br />Fanny's family is of middle class with a large family.  Too large a family (9 children - Fanny is 2nd eldest) that the parents had to send Fanny away at age 10 to relatives for her reception into a society lifestyle.  The 8 years that Fanny lives with the Bertrams, she shows to be more responsible and intelligent.<br /><br />The Bertrams are very wealthy because of a slavery business they own.  Tom and Edward Bertram are complete opposites.  Tom is a free spirit with some drinking and gambling problems.  Edward wants to become a clergyman.  Their sister, Maria, is a romantic.  She marries Mr. Rushworth for his money but is still hopelessly involved with the rake Henry Crawford.  No surprise that the youngest sister, Julia,  is jealous of Maria. But she learns from Maria and uses the sister's mistakes to her own advantages (marries a man her father doesn't approve of).<br /><br />The Bertram children (except for Edward) are all spoiled and selfish.  The father, Sir Thomas, is rightfully ashamed of their actions.  The eldest son, Tom, however is the only one who changes his life for the better.  The two daughters still remain selfish and spoiled (Mrs. Norris, the aunt, encourages this behavior).<br /><br />This is a well written Austen book. I would very much recommend.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This allows you to easily see and pin all kinds of things! The app does force close every other time you open it on Kindle Fire but if you try opening it again immediately afterward it opens and functions great. Overall I love it but the small issue is a little frustrating.
B0063GORYU|5.0|When I need to just 'chill out' and relax, I go to Spider. Have this App on my Smartphone and my Kindle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I just couldn't put the book down!!!  The characters felt so real and it was a great follow-up to Bared to You.  It was very well written that I could feel the emotion that both Eva and Gideon were feeling through the words. There was definate tears shed while reading this.  In fact, I finished reading the book and reread Bared to You and Reflected in You all over again!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyable enough, got a little old by the end. Almost read more like it was written by a man!  Wait for the price to drop
B008O9V4C2|5.0|What can one say?  Most everyone says, reflexively, \\"It's all good\\".  Well, here the word is: \\"It's all great\\"!  By the way, did anyone read the Fagen Bio by Stephen Thomas Erlewine (designated representative for Donald Fagen, Amazon says)?  How could he possibly describe the career of Fagen, in and beyond Steely Dan, and not mention AT ALL the triumphant Grammy-winning album, \\"Two Against Nature\\"?  (He doesn't neglect mentioning the second \\"Everything Must Go\\", so what's up?)  He'd better worry that the \\"New Breed\\" Fagen doesn't find out and \\"liquidate\\" this absent-minded biographer altogether!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The BEST program on television in years. So easy to get involved with the characters. Season 3 cannot  come soon enough for me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It needs portals wolves ocelots and dungeons. Beside the facts that it doesn't have these qualities its a great game. Does anyone know how to install mods on MC PE?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is an interesting game so far, I hope it continues to be interesting as I keep playing. that's it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm breathlessly reading yet another book of this trilogy, the final one, and though I am sad the series is soon to be over, I am really enjoying my time reading... This is yet another great book, full of mysteries and surprises, and I am anxiously waiting to hear the end of the love affair between Ana and Mr. Grey.
B004H4XAXO|5.0|Excellent reading.. the only problem is it leaves you hungry for more.. but there isn't any more, yet!! Thoroughly recommended read!!
098478280X|5.0|Nice book that wrong answer of last version has been fixed. And it is good for you if you want to be sde
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Great book great detail l, loved the Characters, just loved the entire book in general. Happy hunger games and may the odds be ever in your favour
B008OOYALE|1.0|the game has lots of potential. but after you start going u have to spend real money to progress. very disappointing
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game that both you and your children can enjoy playing.  The game does freeze sometimes when you visit other villages and it doesn't always give your hearts for friends, but it's just a game and still very fun.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I strongly recommend this book. Classic Grisham. Told at his normal fast pace and very well put together. U won't regret it.
0307730697|5.0|The ultimate sacrifice that a Navy Seal must make on occasion. Makes me want to cry for them. But it also encourages me to work hard to earn the freedom they protect with their lives. Buy it!

0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter . This was on her request. She got this well before the movie was released.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|but I already finished the game that coated 2.99.<br />oh well. I don't mind Cu's this game is DA BEAST!!?
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Good but I expected more from Johnny Depp and  Tim Burton.Guess my expectations were a bit too high.....Johnny Depp's performance was outstanding , but the story itself needed a bit more flesh.
B00004RFG0|5.0|One of the few movies that improve with age.  I loved it when it first came out and I'm buying it again to keep and never resell.  I'm surprised you don't hear more about this movie as it appeared right before the outbreak (like a rash or virus) of TV reality shows so it has a new relevance now.  But Truman is about more than just that--it is about what everybody's life is becoming.  And best of all it shows that Jim Carrey had the potential, sadly wasted, of becoming a fine actor under the control of a director the caliber of Peter Weir.  I can watch this movie or and over--and frequently do!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great read and highly. Motivational, if you are a runner or not this is a fabulous book. Never underestimate what we are capable of.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|What can I say as an avid fan of SOA- not finished Season 4 yet! This is one of the best dramas I have seen in a long time- well done Kurt Sutter along with the fantastic cast who make the show incredibly believable. If you have never seen a SOA & are sitting on the fence- jump off & grab yourself a copy- you will not be disappointed. On the delivery side- thank you Amazon- prompt & reliable as always- :-)
B00280LYIC|4.0|This is what I call popcorn reading. Light, fun and nothing to really take too much energy. I like the use of the gods and the research behind the books. The characters are likeable, typically teenager, and interesting. I decided to read these because so many of my students had read them and liked them.  I can see why they liked them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!! I have found some great ideas on this site!! I would recommend it to everyone!!! Try it!!
B000N6UERK|5.0|Delivered quickly. Good price made the purchase appropriate for my collection of movies. If you are in the market for suspense and \\"out of the Box\\" premise, this is the movie for you.
B004SBX112|1.0|I bought this app. I do not have the 30 extra games for the haunted house. I wasted $2.99 on this, please do not waste your money on this. I love angry birds but I am really really disappointed about this. This is not even worth the one star I gave it and if it was up to me I would give it a negative 5 stars.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|The Movie Prometheus, starts off with a scene of one of the God aliens, ingesting a compound that kills him, and he falls over the raging water Fall, into the river below.  The compound the alien ingested rips apart his DNA, and causes new sequences to form, this is clearly shown in the video.  We are left to assume that his Dna being dispersed down the river forms, the basis of life.  A river being the source of all life in many cultures ancient writings, keeping with the theme of the movie.<br />  Then we meet the two Archaeologists who are researching the origins of man, documenting many cave paintings that have appeared throughout many cultures in time.  This part of the movie takes a hypothesis from the strange painting and carvings that have been discovered in Hopi Indian, Sumerian cultures to mean that Humans are an engineered species by extra terrestrials. Reminiscent of Erich von Dänikens' Chariots of the Gods.  The story is well done.  The quest of man to meet his maker to know God, then to discover that their God is flawed, with violent tendencies, at the same time you have a little drama taking place where the owner of the corporation that is paying for the expedition has secretly gone along for the voyage so he could meet his God, find a cure for his illness and become immortal, another example of a man with no faith, and comes to the end one would expect.<br />  The story of the God alien is obviously taken from Zacharia Sitchens research on the Annunaki carvings and Sumerian Cuneiform tablets.His book series on the Earth chronicles are a fertile ground of ideas, his research has been known for decades now.  I have long wondered why no other Sci-fi writer or movie maker has borrowed from this man before, obviously the writer of this film is very familiar with his work.  Overall Ridley Scott is an excellent story teller, the film was handled very well, the ending with the Captain of the ship and what he has to do was an example of mans nobility.  The special effects are not over done, which If they were it would  detract from a good story. From a Christian point of view the movie is incredibly blasphemous, but it is a fantasy movie not to be taken to heart Overall I say Ridley Scott did a fine job of story telling.
B009OYTIXS|1.0|The movie is great!highly recommend it, BUT DO NOT TRY AND WATCH ON AMAZON. the player is lousy, does not work. customer support is useless, ad does not help. Told I may not meet the system requirements, I do. Told I may have the wrong software installed. ONLY IF YOU TOLD ME THE WRONG ONE! unable to watch on amazon, so I had to watch on a competitor, which worked first try. Wish I could get my money back, at least it was cheap.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Loved it, Child continues to bring a great story with the Reacher series and leaves the reader wanting more - If you like Jack, you will like the Wanted Man.  Note to self, do not hitchhike at night, you'll understand
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was excellent!! Very well written and good story. Didn't want to put it down.  Can't wait for the next one!!
B005S9ELM6|5.0|Based on a true story with few historical inaccuracies compared to most Hollywood pictures.<br /><br />This tale will likely resonate best for those who lived during the period of the Iran Hostage Crisis or those who are students of History. During the Iranian Revolution a group of younger and fanatic revolutionaries storm the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, and take all but six Americans hostage. Those six escape into the residence of the Canadian Ambassador but it's only a matter of time until they're exposed and what begins is a tense thriller in which every hour puts them at risk.<br /><br />Ben Affleck, who also directed, plays the main character, a CIA operative sent in with an unusual cover of being a movie producer who wishes to film a SciFi picture in Tehran. It's so<br />crazy it might work is one of the arguments and it's basically the best of the bad choices. Affleck's character plans to pick up the six Americans and have them become a part of their movie covers for this movie and then escape through the airport.<br /><br />There's a very impressive cast in this picture. Some of them you won't recognize immediately because everybody is in 70s clothes and hair styles (hard to recognize some people through the beards or mustaches). Some of those people were: Bryan Cranson, Ben Affleck (took a couple of minutes to recognize him), John Goodman, Alan Arkin, Tate Donovan, Kyle Chandler and Zeljko Ivanek.<br /><br />As the credits roll you get to see a comparison of the actor who played a particular character as well as some movie shots in comparison to the actual news shots. I was impressed with the attention to actual TV footages of the time as well as the \\"horrible\\" suit outfits and hair styles.<br /><br />In the limited time this picture has been at the theaters it has made more than it's budget of roughly $44.5M.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: A minus to A; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; HISTORICAL ACCURACY: B plus toA minus (compared to other Hollywood movies); WHEN WATCHED: end of October 2012 (at the movies); OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is bananas.  Totally bananas . I pin stuff all night. I'm like a pinning machine. Bananas. I like turtles.
6305558175|1.0|This movie could have been so wonderful. But instead of making one smile and feel good, they ended it just like all else in this world seems to be ended. If you are looking for a happy ending...do not watch this movie. If you just want to believe in a legacy... at the cost of martyrdom... then watch it. Acting was wonderful though.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed all of 3 books in the series, and the writer leaves us with a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, so therefore I read each book in about 2-3 days, so nothing else got done around the house.  Being 60+ and living through so many wars and so little peacetime, I realized from the beginning that these books were actually references to the way our government has put our children into war generation after generation.  I think the writer is wonderful, but it's such a sad thought to know that even when I'm no longer here on this earth my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will still be suffering through probably more wars. At least the book had a happy although short ending, but you were left knowing that the children who survived would really never be the same. The books must have been good for me to read them all so quickly, but here 2 weeks later, I'm still depressed about the way our country's future could and probably will end up. Also, I did watch the Hunger Games movie and because of the author's intricate details of each character in the book, and the amount of and the detailed violence in the book, I don't believe there was anyway anyone who hadn't read the book could really realize what the writer was trying to get across to all of us by just watching the movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's great. There's so much variety and it's hard to get bored when the next level is a completely different game. :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so strong in the writing that every episode keeps you glued to the TV. The acting is some of the best I have seen. Now a days it is so hard to find a TV show that can keep a persons interrest and keep you wanting to come back and watch every week  but THE WALKING DEAD has done that.  Ken Thomas
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it, this site is Amazing. You'll deff get hooked. They have everything and anything. Everyone I know gets hooked.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love the show. Always get a kick out of it. Can't wait for the next season. Can't go wrong with getting these movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I spend so much time on the app.  I really like the different things you can find on this app.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This was a great movie. I love it, they actually put the USS Missiouri out to sail again after 10 years for this movie.<br />Great effects
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was good. I mean I liked it well enough but it was not as good as Hunger Games.  However, I liked it better than Mockingjay.  Trilogies are often hard to maintain that initial impetus of the story.  I read these as discussion opportunities with two granddaughters to whom I had given the books last Christmas... it worked.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I am  not one to read but couldn't put this down:) I have now read the trilogy and enjoyed each of them
B008B8DY2O|5.0|I have just red Gregory David Robert's Shantaram. I enjoyed it very much. Contemporary classic. Lately no book attracted me as that one.

B001MEJY8W|1.0|This is such a senseless movie. I do not like this movie at all. Not recommended at all. I do not even give this a one star.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I think that this,book can help you and your spouse if you are willing to try. Knowing what makes your spouse us great, but acting on it takes time, effort, desire, energy and commitment. Many people won't change.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|This movie is awesome. eddie murphy is hilarious i found this movie very amussing and heartful. this ia just a great film. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do

B0011Z32KI|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. The best song on here is undoubtedly 'Feeling Good'. This song is big, brassy, and full of attitude.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A new yet interesting take on Vampires and Witches! Its a bit more intellectual. I liked it. this one isn't a tween's book!
B007THA4FI|5.0|The Casual Vacancy by J K Rowlings was a powerful look at politics at work and how it influences peoples lives, for better or worse. I thought it was excellent and would highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Good bible for reading two versions at the same time! Enjoy it alot. The audio portion is also neat to hear while reading.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I really like Bared to You although it contained so many similarities to Fifty Shades that I was slightly turned off.  I pre-ordered reflected in you and read it in two days.  About 1/4 of the way through the book I predicted the ending and turned out to be right.  Those who wrote it was a shocking ending I am a bit surprised by.  I saw the ending coming a mile away.  In the first book I really like Eva and Gideon however in this book they came across as petty and childish.  Eva's passive aggressive tendencies  were very unlikeable and it makes it impossible to believe someone could be so enamored by her pathetic childish insecurities.  I also think it is totally unrealistic to believe that they could have had encounters for 10 hours straight in their car ride to NC, PLEASE!  After reading the second book I am not so excited about the last of the three books.  I have a strong suspicion it will be more unrealistic marathon sex, unlimited orgasms even with little contact and more childish, selfish, passive aggressive behavior.  Gideon would do anything for Eva even though she acts like a complete child.  Oh, I forgot to mention her constant nagging behavior which indeed caused more orgasms.  SARCASM

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is a great game. Its a game where you can fight and build. You can go on survival or creative. Creative is no fight and just building. Survival is where you can fight build and dig. You can also dig on.creative. This is my opinion but j think EVERYONE needs this game.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I bought this for my kindle then realized I had already played it awhile back on my desktop. enjoyed it just as much. Excellent graphics. A good length of play. Puzzles challenging enough. Definitely recommend this game and having played both..,think they did an excellent job of modifying it for the kindle. Very fair price for this game. Looking forward to another from this Polish studio and Big Fish Games.
0316228532|2.0|I expected that Rowling's latest book would contain some wit and humor. These magical characteristics must only belong in the young adult genre. Rowling has written us an \\"adult\\" book, which I suppose is coded language for \\"boring.\\" I did, however, find it ironic that an \\"adult\\" book could be so juvenile.<br /><br />The characters are clich&eacute;d, and The Casual Vacancy is so laced with profanity that it's almost laughable. Rowling comes across like a middle school child who has just discovered that he can \\"cuss\\" with friends and get away with it. She uses her newfound vocabulary to the point of absurdity. The ubiquitous sex and vulgarity make the book awkward and clumsy.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the book, however, is its cast of characters. I admit that a few characters are interesting, but as I said most of citizens of Pagford are clich&eacute;s. None of the characters, however, are likeable. From page 1 to page 503, I genuinely didn't care about one person in the book. The only person that I thought might potentially be likeable was the councilman whom Rowling killed off on the second page. At times I realized that Rowling wanted me to view certain characters sympathetically, but she never managed to convince me.<br /><br />Though I believe the lack of a sympathetic character to be the unforgiveable sin in a novel, Rowling compounds her transgressions by offering a fairly boring plot. Not only did I not care about the characters in the book, but also their deeds were tedious and unrelated. The book claims to be about the election to fill the dead councilman's seat, and a number of pages deal with that theme. But really, the whole election could have been left out of the book and not much would have changed. The political maneuverings that attended the election spark a few interesting events, but alas, these events go nowhere.<br /><br />All these wasted pages left me with one simple question: \\"What was Rowling's editor at Little Brown thinking?\\" And then I realized. The editor at Little Brown must have known that this was a train wreck of a book. Any editor worth his or her salt could see that this book was at least 200 pages too long. Any editor could see the problems with character and plot. But it didn't matter because this was J. K. Rowling. The Casual Vacancy would sell amazingly well no matter how bad it was. No editor would dare suggest improvements to the book, because no editor would risk her taking the project somewhere else.ized.

0385738765|5.0|This book lived up to it's expectation after the first book. Great reading and I'm not even a teen. Hope next one is just as good. Would recommend it greatly.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|We've been hearing the hype for months about the \\"bombastic drum sound\\", the \\"Destroyer mixed with  Revenge\\" comparison, the \\"paying tribute to our influences\\" and the \\"Thayer really out did himself on this one\\" comments.<br /><br />I LOVE IT.  It is a logical progression from Sonic Boom.  It has elements that draw from Carnival of Souls, Rock & Roll Over, Love Gun, Revenge, Destroyer, etc.  First thing noticed was that Hell or Hallelujah had some speed and intensity to it which reminds me of the exciting \\"I stole Your Love\\" album opening vibe.  Second thing noticed was the classic rock twinges: \\"Outta This World\\" has a Mississippi Queen riff twisted in, \\"Long Way Down\\" has Zeppelin influence throughout reminiscent of Out On The Tiles or something from Physical Graffiti,  \\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\" has guitar/vocal trade offs like the mighty Zep,  \\"The Devil Is Me\\" guitar solo is incredibly different for Tommy and reminds me of Whole Lotta Love Jimmy Page. \\"All For The Love Of Rock N Roll\\" sounds totally classic rock.  Even Though I see all these great influences & roots, when I step back and look at the big picture: MONSTER is uncharted territory and unlike almost any of their other albums......this is why I love it so much.<br /><br />Paul's songs are very solid and riffs give me random flashbacks to Mr. Speed, All American Man, Take It Off, King Of The Nightime World, Danger Us,  Etc.  While Paul's voice may be a little shaky live lately, this is not apparent on the album and he can still put down some great vocals in the studio.  \\"Last Chance\\" rocks!!<br /><br />Tommy's guitar solos are different from the Sonic Boom, Ace Frehley style safe & predictable sound.  They are definitely stepped up and all a little different.  This is THE BEST PART OF THE ALBUM.  More guitar and better guitar tastefully squeezed in keeps the songs intense.  Outta This World is great but Tommy needs to realize that not all his lyrics need to be about outer space or lightning.<br /><br />Gene's voice sounds incredible.  Gene does what he does best and his songs were written well enough to allow him to sing/scream at us like we all deserve.  Wall Of Sound, The Devil Is Me & Back To The Stone Age are classic Gene..... all rooting from his songs like I'm An Animal, Within, Not For The Innocent, And On The 8th Day, Etc.<br /><br />Eric's drumming is great.  The songs on this album allow him to deliver the goods.  More up-tempo and more changes/fills on this one.<br /><br /> - \\"Freak\\" may be a little weak compared to the other songs.<br /> - I've heard people complaining about \\"corny lyrics\\"......this is KISS !!!  Remember \\"Take Me\\", \\"X-Ray Eyes\\", \\"Rockin' In The USA\\", \\"Love EM & Leave EM\\", etc.  Elements of Schlock Rock have been around since day one!  \\"I TOLD HER THAT I HAD A SUBMARINE\\"...........Great Stuff !!!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I have been buying Hiatt's CD's for the past 10 years or so (had to catch up on some earlier ones).  I felt the last 3-4 were pretty lackluster.  Mystic Pinball is a return of the great John Hiatt of old.  Each song is really a masterpiece of its kind and bear repeated listenings. Hiatt's singing has never been better and he has a really great players in the studio with him.  This would be a CD for a Hiatt-newbie or the most weather-beaten fan. Cannot recommend this too highly!
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Gary Moore since I discovered him on a wicked cut on Paul Rodgers' Muddy Waters tribute album from the 90's. I was very saddened when Gary passed away in 2011, but his work lives on. This release of his live \\"Blues for Jimi\\" performance in 2007 is just what I needed to remind me of how freaking good Gary was.<br /><br />The selection of tunes is to be expected, but so tastefully done that the CD excels even though I've heard all of these songs so many times before. I was never much for Gary's vocals, and this does not change my opinion. However, his guitar work on these Hendrix tunes overcomes his voice. Simultaneously, Gary stays true to the original guitar work by Hendrix but adds his own flare with mastery. He stays surprisingly close to the Hendrix versions of these songs, but he takes his solos, intros and outros farther ... into Gary's strengths. His control of the feedback and effects is stunning. Sure it's 40 years after Hendrix did this same stuff, but it is a pleasure to hear it again in the hands of someone who obviously cares about the original artistry and wants to pay homage with his own talents. Highly recommended.

Now, I decide to send them back to get them replaced (AND obviously they don't want to give me a refund on my shipping costs... another con.) I get the headest (a new one) and of course it stops working after 1 month. This product is very disapointing and trust me it's not worth your time, effort and mostly money, get them Astro's, so much better. [[ASIN:B002BU0DPE PS3 Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset]]
B004XKVPG6|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The picture is sharp, with a good level of detail.  It is a dark transfer, however, with deep black tones and strong contrast.  I do not remember the DVD being so dark.  Whether this was the director's original vision for the film or simply a darker-than-normal transfer, I am not sure.  But it actually works, adding to the gloomy and creepy atmosphere.  Some film grain was evident in low-lit scenes, but it did not detract from the sharpness of the picture.  The sound was more problematic.  On my system, the music occasionally overpowered the dialogue.  I had to adjust the settings in order to minimize the score and bring the dialogue to the fore.  From that point on, it sounded fine.<br /><br />So should a person who owns the DVD upgrade to the blu-ray?  It is a judgment call, but I would say yes for the quality of the visuals.  But you might need to adjust the sound some.

B008JH5CVS|4.0|This action-packed film taking mostly place in outerspace was exactly what I expected  - and what I was looking for. As another reviewer mentioned, this is the kind of film who see, lay back and \\"grab the pop-corn (or chocolate, or coke, or whatever you eat or drink when you watch a film...).<br /><br />The story is not original. As others have mentioned, it is basically \\"Escape from New York\\" with a new set of actors, the prison set in space rather than New-York, and the President's daughter swaped around for the President himself. There are however a few additional twicks, such as the 500 prisoners being put into stase and this having so rather unpleasant side effects on at least some of them, or some rather nasty things happening to some of the horrible misfits which make up the guineapig population of this space prison. There are indeed references to a number of other similar films as well, many of which are from the 80s and 90s. Outland is one and having the space prison about to crash back onto Earth makes you think of one the Aliens series (the last one, if I remember correctly). As others have also mentioned, there is a bit of \\"Die Hard\\" in it as well, if only the wisecracking hero who gets bashed about all the time but somehow survives and wins, of course.<br /><br />The science fiction bits and pieces are rather interesting, even if \\"d&eacute;j&agrave; vu\\", for most of them at least. I liked the space prison's automatic defenses although you cannot help wondering why a space prison would have top notch military defenses as if it was some kind of space fortress. This, however, is precisely what you should NOT start doing: start thinking and wondering whether it makes sense. It does not, or at least not always. Neither is this a wonderful piece of filming with superbly original roles. It is an unpretentious action-packed film with \\"goodies\\" and baddies\\", just in a good old John Wayne cowbow film, except that here we are in space and in 2079.<br /><br />It is just meant to be entertaining, and it certainly is that, but only that. So, relax and enjoy: I did...just meant to be entertaining, and it certainly is that, but only that. So, relax and enjoy: I did...

0596804822|5.0|This is simply the best book on iPhone game programming i've ever seen. This is not an ordinary book on this topic. You can pick any other typical iOS GameDev book, learn it and you will be able to write something with it's help. But once you will decide to switch to another platform - Android, Windows, etc. you'll come out with a bunch of gaps in your knowledge. Philip does deeply explain all the stuff from cross-platform standpoint and goes down to iPhone platform. That's it - you can pick this book and learn OpenGL programming for Windows at the same time! The code, that is supplied to this book can be quickly ported to other platforms, like Windows, because Philip does show you the best way of writing game code - c\c++, platfrom independent code.

I also want to know exactly what happened to Christain in his early years to make him feel the way he does.

B008G12ERC|5.0|It took listening to the album about 2 or 3 times before the songs could really sink in and once they did I have been playing the album over and over and over again.  I love every song except track #3.  That's my least favorite, but the other songs are just pure awesomeness.  There seems to be some debate over this dubstep thing or at least about what Muse is doing with dubstep.  I love it.  They made it sound amazing.  I'm one happy fan.  I've never been disappointed by any of their albums.  Seriously, after 6 studio albums that's kind of something to be proud of Muse.  One hit album after another.  I think it's possible that this album may not sell as well as the last album, but I love this album. Love it!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I honestly do not remember reading a book for 550 pages before anything significant happened. Nice writing style and a quick read, but if you are looking for more than a few action sequence and 500 pages of Arab history and cute one liners , I would pass. Demille is always entertaining, but not so much here. Sometimes it is possible to be too witty, to the point of nauseating.<br /><br />I like a good backstory as much as anyone, but this book could have been 150 pages less.  Not his best work.
B000SEIKIW|5.0|I have not read the first book so I cannot compare; however, I really enjoyed this one. Easy read, a book I could not put down and I enjoyed shared with my friends. It made me want to find out more about string theory as well as Stephen Hawking's work.

Stay Stay Stay, Holy Ground, and The Lukcy One are among her best.  In fact the second half of the album is much better than the first half when she write the soings by herself and does not work with co-writers.  Highly recommended!

0307341550|4.0|The author Gillian Flynn did a good job writing this novel. This is the second novel I have read by this author. The novel is written in first person. The main character is deep and it took some time to get an idea of what she was all about. Once I started to understand her point of view the novel started to take off and turn into a page turner. Although I do not like the subject matter it was a good read. The author did an excellent job when she was describing Camille's emotions. The emotions that she was feeling and having the words flash across her skin. That was a real good part of the novel very descriptive and well written, very good! It drew me into the character even more. There was one typographical error. I have and would recommend this e-book to a friend.
B007SGM084|3.0|The story is good so far, but there are definitely elements that are extremely parallel to Twilight. Right down to the hair color on Christian. Even some of the situations, and the descriptions of feelings. It's a little difficult to get past. But when you do, the story is interesting, and keeping me curious. I am only on the second book right now, but I do intend to keep going, so that must be a good sign...
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Riordan combines reality with  fantasy, and adds a fascinating sense of wonder and humor to The Mark of Athena, making it a book that will make his fans forget their dinner and stay awake late to read the very last word.  He modernizes heroes of the past, and revives ancient relics, triggering a new curiosity in young minds, and attracting a whole new legion of fans that will praise his books long after they have been written.  Riordan is truly amazing and inspiring for bright future minds.  In some people, such as old, he brings out the child in them and restores the spirit that once lived so freely in them.
B005FISBTO|2.0|The unskippable channel preview is bad enough, but the video quality is horrendous.  Blocking artifacts everywhere, blurred images, and poor color-tone.  I love this show, but I'm horribly disappointed by the DVD mastering.<br /><br />All of the previous DVD collections had excellent quality and I anticipated the same from this season.  Considering this season was shot in HD, this is really inexcusable. Buy the BD or just skip this season entirely.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I am sad to say that this is my last Logitech purchase I'll make in my lifetime, this product had overall good reviews here at amazon.com, and I listened to the community, however in hindsight I should have looked at the Logitech forums to see clearly what has happened to me and many many others without a real solution or fix presented by Logitech, which in turn would've saved me the money spent on this product.<br /><br />When it worked, the 7.1 sound was great, however even when working the sound/signal would pop, screech and cut-out sometimes for minutes before beginning to function again, and sometimes would require a system reboot to function at all once again.<br /><br />The software seems to be completely ignored by Logitech, as most of their \\"solutions\\" to these issues are: change the wireless receiver to another USB port, restart your computer, run the battery completely out and then charge completely before using again, uninstall and reinstall the Logitech G930 software...To all those \\"solutions\\" none have provided a real fix, as the problems resurface not long after resuming use of the G930's.<br /><br />Currently I've uninstalled the G930 software, and they work just fine, HOWEVER- PLEASE NOTE, that without the software, features such as 7.1 surround, hotkey's on the headset, and headset volume dial WILL NOT FUNCTION.<br /><br />I will now be looking into purchasing a product that WILL function as advertised and is supported by it's developer to actually fix issues that may arise- instead of ignoring them which Logitech seems to now do.<br /><br />I rarely review purchases, but in the poor experience and support I've gotten from Logitech concerning the G930 I had to speak up and warn any would-be consumers looking to purchase this unsupported and buggy product.

B005H2IAM6|5.0|The very premise of this movie, and indeed the Iscander story, is so rooted in the history of WWII Japan and the 1945 Battleship of the same name that it is hard not to be moved by it. In 1945, as the US was approaching Okinawa, the Yamato was all that was left of the Japanese Imperial Navy. Setting forth on one final mission to beach itself on the far side of Okinawa and fire it's huge Canons across the island at the US fleet,out of range of return canon fire, but not out of range from carrier-based aircraft, it's junior officers were essentially embarking on a Naval Kamikaze mission.<br /><br />Space Battleship Yamato parallels much of this. Nagasaki and Horishima are seen in the way the Planet Bombs are decimating Earth. The last Battleship of the Earth Defense Force bears the same name and is built from the ruins of that very ship. Setting out a Junior crew on what many thought was likely a suicide mission.<br /><br />What makes this important for Japan, is that this time it worked. Yamato out-fought all it's foes to save Earth.<br /><br />To understand the impact in the 1970's when many of the Japanese still remembered what their valiant soldiers did to try and save them, is to understand how Space Battleship Yamato aspires to continue the life of the largest and arguably greatest Battleship ever built, and give them the victory this time around that they never had back then.<br /><br />In many ways, I wish the telling of this story had been spread out a little more across 2 or 3 movies. But for those who appreciate the cultural impact of the original story, and even those who were excited as children to see the flying battleship in space, this is an impressive movie. I love the passion the Japanese have in movies. Over the top and blush worthy at times, I actually enjoy watching it. And the special effectswere fantastic. Combined with the authenticity of the musical score, I felt goosebumps on my goosebumps at times.<br /><br />Exceptional movie. I hope thereis more to come.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved the books!!! At first it was a lot of sex which was fun to read and  wow was it fun lol ! anyway, I was waiting and hoping for a romance and As I got to the second book, it was still a lot of sex but also the story started to unfold.  By the last book I fell in love with the characters, the love story and to be honest Maybe a SOFT  limit here and there wouldn't be so bad :)
B007NESBK2|5.0|I was so Excited when I saw this was Finally available!<br />I've been to 3 Sade concerts and I have to say, This Was My Favorite! My husband and I went to this concert in Indianapolis, and all through the show we kept saying, \\"They have to be taping for a DVD!\\"<br />The stage production was so elaborate and the sound was superb. She's back with the original band members (Sweetback) and it's like putting on your favorite jeans or those broke in shoes...Perfect! They sound phenomenal; and they do ALL THE HITS... Old & New!<br />The Blue-Ray quality made me feel like I was back in the arena. I even got to see some different things on stage, thanks to the different camera angles. The extras are cool to watch as well. You get to see Sade & the band behind stage and behind the scenes, and witness the production come together.<br />This is a MUST-HAVE for EVERY Sade fan! If you're not a Big Sade Fan now, you will be after watching this! If you've never seen her live, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!

B007THA4FI|1.0|I have never read any of the Harry Potter books, so I'm not biased toward the author one way or another, and I didn't expect anything because of Rowling's prior success. For that I am glad, because the book would have fallen short of my expectations, undoubtedly.  It is a boring story that draws on and on, and the entire plot is extremely depressing.  The only character in the book with any redeeming qualities dies in the first few pages.  I would not want to live in the town of Pagford, nor would I want to be friends with any of the characters. I have to scratch my head and ask, \\"Why?\\"  She could have written any book imaginable and it would have sold copies because everyone expected greatness.  Shoot, I even bought it and I hadn't ever bought a book of hers before.  The problem for Ms. Rowling is that I'll never buy another one of her books again, and I wish I could return this one.  If this had been her first published novel, she never would have gotten a book deal for Harry Potter.

0316926345|5.0|Brideshead is the ancestral home of an aristocratic British family dating back hundreds of years. In the period between the World Wars we are introduced to a family who are being torn asunder by stresses related to failed marriages, alcoholism , and loss of religious faith in some of it's members. The protagonist of Waugh's masterful novel meets the youngest son while at Oxford and the depth of their attachment to each other leads him to be intimately involved with the rest of the family , so much so that his affection is ultimately transferred to his friend's sister. The numerous characters in this novel are sympathetic to the reader for a variety of reasons and the depth of their characterizations draw the reader into the story in a very personal way. Waugh was a master at demonstrating the random ebb and flow of human affairs and relationships.<br /> The decline of the home itself is symbolic of the disarray of the lives of it's inhabitants. I loved this book and highly recommend it to fans of classic literature.
B009JBZH54|2.0|I know most people don't really care about the Commentary or Deleted Scenes anymore but I feel like for this trilogy since we've all already bought the movies \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" before it would be nice to throw us a bone and say, hey, here is an easter egg where on this box set you get Director Commentary and Deleted Scenes which all you fans have been asking for since 2005.  It makes me feel like eventually they will release another box set with those particular features when they want to make a little more money off the franchise.  I know I am going to get slammed for this on the internet but I still feel as a film that Batman Begins was definitely the most complete of all the movies, meaning, without all the plot holes and the most solid story.  I'm not saying that HEath Ledger wasn't great as the Joker, and that The Dark Knight Rises wasn't a massive scale movie beyond the likes of most in the genre, but as a film Batman Begins is the most complete.  Just my opinion and we are all entitled to our opinion.  That being said, the Dark Knight Rises is a Batman movie that is the most \\"Comic Booky\\" of the franchise and I think it hurts the franchise and has massive plot holes that never seem to make any sense what so ever.  The Dark Knight has some blaring ones as well but yet, that's why it didn't win best picture.  My biggest issue with the 3rd installment is that you make a Batman Movie to end all Batman movies so to speak and it is almost 3 hours long and, spoiler alert, Batman's barely in it for 10 minutes...  They destroy Gotham City and Bruce Wayne has a broken spine that gets \\"Punched Back into place\\" and has some mystery leg issue in the beginning of the movie that amazingly goes away mid way through the movie and he is trapped in a hole in what I guess is supposed to be either Afghanistan or South America, they never really establish that, he climbs out and then is hundreds of miles from anything, with no money, no Alfred, and no way to communicate with anyone, and he has to get back to Gotham in under 12 hours before the city blows up, and he does, and has time to light a GIANT gasoline Bat Symbol, oh yeah the city that the Army and Navy Seals, and Marines, can't even get into, write a will and leave items to people who he would have had no clue what they were doing in the first place being in a hole for 3 months, and frees all the cops who have had the ENTIRE POLICE FORCE OF GOTHAM, trapped underground for a month with little to no food or water and they come out ready to fight without facial hair and clothes in fine shape...not to mention he gives access to his \\"Clean Energy Nuclear Bomb to basically anyone and oddly to turn it on or remove it from it's top secret holding area without BATMAN needing to be there to enter the final access code, the guy who created a sonar system to spy on the entire city??  I could go on for far to long on this but it's not worth it because I know as well as anyone who reads this that though I was so disappointed with The Dark Knight Rises, where Batman abandons protecting Gotham for 8 years and then after defeats the bad guy leaves Gotham in worse shape than it was before I am still going to buy it because I need to round out the trilogy and complete my set as a movie fan and a Batman fan.  At least I am honest about it.

B0048LPRCS|5.0|I don't think we have enough time and distance yet to realize how new and singular Enter The Void actually is. Singular here is a very important adjective. Gaspar Noe's vision may vaguely conjure up David Lynch; particularly the yarn within the yarn of Mulholland Drive and, in turn, Inland Empire. But this is a film that sets out on its own two feet, that ventures into a world of memory and posthumous viewership. It addresses death in a manner that would make Georges Bataille proud, which is to say that dying becomes a renewal of spirit as formative as a second arrival. But, as with Bataille, that doesn't automatically mean that all is right again. All is lost.<br /><br />I part with many critics who say that Noe's cinema is always one of nihilism and strained edginess. I Stand Alone is, in my opinion, the least of his efforts. It coasts on a wanton desire to shock, and suffers for that reason. But Irreversible, especially known for a few graphic scenes (and we all know what they are already), merges this transgression with consequence. Many people forget that, in the rewind that is the movie, we wind up in a bedroom with a naked couple in love. It seems as though the city decided to bleed all over their plans. You don't need to take a graduate level film theory class to see the dissonance. It's an inwardly beautiful world for two lovers; it's a chaotic, inconsiderate turned malevolent one once you step outside.<br /><br />Likewise with Tokyo and Enter The Void. Tokyo doesn't care, just as Los Angeles, New York, London, and Paris don't care. It is a canvas for loss and disappointment, especially when one is sent there already adrift. And Oscar and Linda have always been adrift. There is no city, no concrete or neon, that is going to replace what's gone. In the west we like to see travel or exotic locale as generic enlightenment on screen.  Don't come here for that. Our characters' places are quickly defined, and as soon as that happens we are carried into a numinousspace. Tokyo becomes the metro of dreams, not some sightseeing tour to give us false revelations. And the rest of the film is one big dream or nightmare, twisting within itself and crawling back to pivotal moments.<br /><br />This is now one of a handful of films that perceptively captures the subconscious or unconscious state. Film buffs can see its influences, most notably the pinks, oranges, and reds of Kenneth Anger's short works. And, yes, it evokes 2001 in its grand, albeit fractured scope. But it is also terribly sad and affecting, which is something I don't hear often enough from critics and reviewers. \\"Trippy\\" does not begin to do it justice, and is a term we probably should have retired in the sixties. It comes with more than that, with sibling separation, with love that flowers in death, with things that we can't get back. As with Irreversible, which this film surpasses by leaps and bounds, there is consequence here. The feeling of a void is palpable.<br /><br />Directors do not owe us happy experiences. Noe doesn't give us one. I recall reading an article many years ago about something called \\"the impossible loss,\\" referring to the residue a nightmare leaves us with. That is contained herein. It transcends the violence, the graphic sex (what sex isn't?), and anything else that is distractingly tangible. Everyone's enfant terrible is not just provoking in these two plus hours, he's kicking open the floodgates for new and unexplored textures. This film is about the impossible loss, and it moves along the columns of a dying mind. Take time with it. Watch it more than once.

B007THA4FI|5.0|I am one of many 50+ years old people who bought this book because I was smitten by the writer over a decade ago, and cannot stop re-reading her. I wanted some fresh material, from her pen, about love. About complicated relationships, darkness and light, loyalty and fear. I was not disappointed. I've never been a reader of novels like this, so it took me one reading to understand the form. In the second reading I am able to recognize the richness of character, subtlety of story, and was left wanting to know more about the fall-out in this small town around the events that unfolded. I purchased the book, and the e-book, and continue to explore the details and turns-of-phrase throughout both versions, which seems to reaffirm, for me, the brilliance of Ms. Rowling.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I purchased this so that I could have serial access to a nearby computer (the iLO port of an HP rx2880, to be precise) from my USB-only iMac desktop machine.  This is the first USB-to-serial cable that I've found that works with MacOS X.  It came with up-to-date drivers, which were easy to install (by the comprehensive instructions, also on the disc).  After installing the driver and rebooting, I was able to access the serial port via /dev/tty.usbtoserial as follows, from the MacOS X terminal program:<br /><br />screen /dev/tty.usbtoserial 19200<br /><br />where the 19200 was the baud rate (yours may vary).  Note that for some applications you may need a null modem and a gender changer (as I did).

B00285K1KE|4.0|Hey what can I say - I knew that another Hulk movie was around and as it goes I stumbled on this. Do not remember seeing it and read alot of the reviews prior to renting. As a few folks mentioned its not all action or infused with comic lines, however it was a first class movie. More likened in the genre to Captain America instead of Iron man, Avengers so on and so forth. I thought it was  good in it's detailed presentation of establishing a history and have no complaints. Acting was good, and all the usual items one looks at in reviewing a flick. A Joss W. movie it isn't, but if your a superhero fan it doesn't fail at all. For a 3 buck rental or I believe 10 buck buy it's a worthy flick for the collection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good cast, good acting, good special effects, and very good cinematography.  I appreciated that it followed the book as much as a different medium can.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It took a long while to get into it, and then when I did, it definitely had twists and turns and all that!  HOWEVER, I think the ending was a total let down, I can imagine SEVERAL other options and ways to end this story other than how it did end.  I loved the twists and shockers, I wasn't thinking the way the story was going, and I love books that keep me guessing.<br /><br />Other than the slow start and the abrupt ending, it was a good read!

B000QCS8TW|1.0|The one star is not for the story, but the price.  I saw the paperback in Walmart for $6.74 and didn't buy it because I'd prefer it on my Kindle.  I also thought I'd save money by not purchasing a hard copy.  Boy was I wrong.  It seems buying a virtual copy of this book is at a premium.  But I'm sure that's because it costs the publisher more to make digital copies than actually print books.  I doubt very seriously the author receives any more money even thought the publisher charges more with less overhead costs. Hence the Amazon disclaimer \\"This price was set by the publisher\\"  It's not like the publisher is price fixing or anything...Go Random House Digital, Inc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the publisher's slice on the kindle version should be slimmed down the to cost of disk space it took up.  That'd sure lower the price.  Or even cut the middle man out all together and give the author their take and Amazon's hosting fee.  Screw the publisher...they don't seem to mind sticking it to us.<br /><br />For the record I love this book and I highly recommend it...however DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION AT 133% THE PRICE OF THE PAPERBACK.
B0086213XW|1.0|I'm halfway through this movie and I keep looking to see if it's almost done. I kind of like Michelle Williams and of course I like Seth Rogen and Sarah Silverman rocks, but, man oh man, this movie just inches along, driving me crazy. I'm sick of the babytalk between Michelle and Seth's characters and I don't think the neighbor is sexy at all and it's hard to believe she never noticed her directly across the street neighbor and Seth's character isn't developed at all. He sure looks hotter than in previous movies, though! Michelle's character looks like she is in existential agony all the time. I feel like hurling her or my own exhausted head against the wall! So passive-aggressive.<br />Save your money.<br />I feel like I need to watch a James Bond movie to detoxify.....

B005LAIHQS|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie, I bought the Men in Black 3 (Two Disc Combo: Blu-ray / DVD + UltraViolet Digital Copy), and has great effects, but Will Smith looks so old, the blu ray technology and full hd isn't good for his wrinkled face.<br /><br />The blu ray comes with a shooting gallery game.

0985081821|5.0|This novel grabs you nearly from the first page and it drove me nuts that my schedule didn't allow me to indulge as I wanted to.  I am completely and utterly exhausted now as I had only read about a quarter of the book before I picked it up today, but plowed through the rest as if it were nothing at all.  To give you an idea how exhausted I am, I woke up at 6:30 a.m. for class and it is now 2 a.m..  It has been a long day, but I've also thoroughly enjoyed myself.<br /><br />The Forever Girl details the extraordinary events in the life of a young woman named Sophia Parsons.  The novel is paranormal fiction with a healthy dose of romance thrown in there but not the formulaic nonsense that some publishers spit out.  There's action and drama and suspense and past life regressions, special powers, and supernatural creatures that are up to no good.  All in all, a fun read (and yes, it made me laugh and smile at times).<br /><br />I loved the depth of the characterization in the novel.  Sophia is by no means a simple character and, like anyone you truly get to know, she contradicts herself upon closer inspection.  She made me smile and laugh at her inner thought and dialogs, many times because of how relatable they are to everyday life.  Secondary characters Ivory and Charles are equally deep, even though the Hamilton rarely deviates from Sophia's perspective.<br /><br />Rebecca Hamilton creates a unique world of supernatural creatures that isn't quite like any I've ever read and pulls it off with an entertaining flair that draws the reader in and keeps you until the last page.  I thoroughly encourage you to pick up The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton.  Just make sure you have enough time so finish it as you won't be able to put it down!

B006FE83UE|5.0|I had forgotten, what a meaningful movie this was and how wonderful and actor Gregory Peck was! I really enjoyed the movie;  it showed how the kids and the adults could really get along and not worry about \\"the race stuff\\"! (I especially loved how the kids sat with the African-American townspeople in the court house upper level and it wasn't \\"wrong\\") The story of how a African American was accused of a Caucasion woman's rape, was the main focus of the plot. The man was put on trial and sentenced. Gregory Peck was the man's lawyer and really his \\"advocate\\" for justice! In the end,there was a second death;  the sherriff was called in, and  wanted the possible \\"murder\\"(it was really self defense in my book), to be forgotten or put on the books as an accident....sooo after all the pain and tribulation,  he had changed and wanted people to come together, to forget their differences and to \\"get along\\"! It was truly a great story of UNDERSTANDING!!!! LOVED IT! LOVED IT! LOVED IT!!
B0095R76EW|3.0|Eh, it was ok. The plot takes about 2 seconds to figure out, and you just have to wait about 2 hours for it all to happen. It didn't have any charm or other qualities you would expect from a romantic comedy.

B00004XPPE|5.0|This movie scared me 'back in the day' and it still holds true today.  The players in our more modern world might be different but the tension & the possibility is still real.  As another reviewer said: \\"Henry Fonda provides a superb performance in this powerful drama which keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very last image on the screen. The tension unfolds minute by minute following the ill-fated crew from the beginning of their routine flight to their terror-filled battle through Soviet airspace towards their target - Moscow! Will they succeed, will they be recalled, will they be shot down? Superb acting and skillful writing combine to produce one of the best (anti) cold war films of our time.\\"

1616960922|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has graced us with yet another wonderfully creative fantasy tale.  Shai has been imprisoned for her use of Forgery in trying to replace the Moon Scepter while stealing the original.  While imprisoned, Shai is tasked with Forging a new soul within a hundred days for the emperor Ashravan who has been left as an invalid after an assassination attempt that took the life of his wife.  Knowing that she will be killed as soon as she has completed Forging his soul, Shai must plan an escape while trying to conform to the task given her in order to be allowed to live long enough to see her plan through.<br /><br />This is a fairly short novella, but is brimming with brilliant concepts and interesting characters.  The idea of Forging is unique, Forgers being able to rewrite the history of objects, and even souls, and by doing so, changing them.<br /><br />Shai's character is full of depth, being painted at first as a simple thief and later as something much more.  Her emotions run deep, and her pride in her Forgery serves as her motivation for her actions.<br /><br />With the amazing concepts introduced in this book, I hope that Brandon Sanderson will one day expand upon this story with a sequel or two.  There are a couple small threads left open to provide the opportunity to do so with the story still working perfect as a standalone such as Elantris.  Don't be put off by this novella's length - the quality of the story and characters make this book worth every penny.

0316067598|4.0|The book is easy to read. Written in almost a conversational style (with a bit of a Texas accent seeping though) but that's ok with me yal.  It was a good book that went into a detail about the whole seals training process as well as the mission that placed luttrell in harms way. However it was the time he was recovering from his wounds waiting to be rescued that spoke to me the most  I found such tender compassion and beauty in the villagers who defended his life. It was astonishing to me that they would go to such lengths to help another human soul who they really had no obligation to at all.  That's why I loved this read. Not just because the heroism of those soldiers who lost their lives (which is amazing) but of those who were neither soldier nor American yet risked their lives for one of ours.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I purchased this book because I read the entire Harry Potter series and had come to love the writing of J.K. Rowling. I did not expect this to be anything like the Harry Potter series but I was curious to see what this talented author would write next. I was not disappointed at all.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy takes place in a small, fictitious town in England. The characters are people we all know and deal with in our every day lives. This story is not action packed and will not leave you at the edge of your seat but it is the kind of story I enjoy very much. It deals with every day issues, some of them quite volatile, and she deals with them in a very realistic way. She takes on the issues of bullying, child abuse and neglect, parent/child relationships, poverty, the pettiness of local politics, and so much more. She explores marriage through many couples in this town and shows us through her very detailed descriptions that no one really knows what goes on behind closed doors. She is able to write the teenagers as well as the older generation and the characters, to me, were completely believable.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the story away so I will leave you with this one last thought. If you are interested in reading a book that delves into the lives of people in a small town, deals with relevant social issues, and is not tied up in a pretty little bow at the end, then this book is for you. If you are looking for action and adventure and something along the lines of the Harry Potter series, do not read this book. You will be disappointed.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|If this movie was named \\"Magic Michelle\\" and had a mostly female, barely clothed cast, we would see those male reviews rise signficiantly! Someone FINALLY makes a mainstream movie with a sexy cast AND a story line & men are whining, whining, whining! Good grief! Let us enjoy all Channing & the guys have to offer without the bellyaching! Me & my friends made this one of our \\"girls night out\\" get-togethers & we had a BLAST watching it. I wouldn't have drug my husband to see it as I knew he wouldn't enjoy it anymore than I enjoyed \\"Showgirls\\". However, I plan to buy the DVD, download it & watch it every chance I get because ..... Good Lord, Mike IS MAGIC!!
B007G92QGO|5.0|Great read so many twists and turns increbile insight into families.Keeps your attention to the end , just goes to show you have no idea the background of the families living in your suburb
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I would like to use this app to install other apps like netflix on an android tablet that came with \\"getjar\\" that my son uses. I don't want to finish the instilation because I don't want him to be able to purchase stuff with out my signing in. Why does \\"one click ordering\\" have to be a requirement and is there a way to block purchasing without the entering of a password with this app?
B008NABUU8|5.0|Fun! I love this game and I love the concept but it is a tad unstable. I've had it crash on my Kindle fire (original) twice. I hope updates are released to stabilize it but the game itself is awesome.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|You need to be a little conservative when you start out or you'll quickly find yourself out of coins and having to wait for more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it is just like temple run but better I recommend this to every one please play!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much, even if it was the second time I read it. It has the perfect balance between death, hatred, and romance. I gave it 5 stars because it keeps you on the edge and wanting more. It has a perfect ending that makes you want to continue the series. I would recommend this book to people who aren't faint of heart, love action, and want a little romance.
B0091REZMW|5.0|really good game for those late nights when nobody else is awake. I play it almost everyday in my doom room
B001NLKT60|5.0|Awesome story.  I loved this one more than the first one! Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
1432794426|5.0|I just loved the book. It was very insightful. I would highly recommend it to all fans of Michael Jackson.
1451620829|5.0|As a huge fan of the original four,I preordered this book and was not let down when it arrived. I couldn't put it down, and read it in two nights. Peter Criss comes across as honest and really human. I can only imagine the emotion as he had to recall in detail all these painful memories. Granted, he did get to live the life of a rock superstar, but there were prices he paid. The book really has some laugh out loud moments as well. Although ultimately the book does provide a cautionary tale about trusting people close to you. Great book! Surpassed my expectations.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It's a very good read! It kept me interested. I will read the the third. The only thing I didn't like was that it reminded me of 50 Shades of Gray. Rich guy, plain girl........
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire. It is very reliable. I like that I can set it up to wake up to my playlist.

0525952926|5.0|Book was interesting and exciting.  Very well written and everything I expected from Ken Follett.  Can't wait for the next one.
B0091REZMW|5.0|if you like gardens of time then you will LOVE this game.the graphics are cool and it is worth the effort to posy.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|When I first saw Subway Surfers my first thought was that it was a \\"Me Too\\" clone of Temple Run. Well, Subway Surfers is a clone of Temple Run but it's a surprisingly good clone and I have to say I am enjoying it.<br />This game has a cartoon urban flavor and the gameplay consists of your character running away from the screen to evade a conductor. Right now there is sn optional Halloween theme so my character is fleeing Frankenstein's Monster. You run automatically and swipe to the sides to switch paths, up to jump and down to duck and roll. As you run you collect coins and items such as powerups and bonuses. You can run on the ground or on top of subway trains and if you hit an obstacle the conductor catches you or a subway train smacks into you.<br />Coins can be used to buy things like a hovetboard for hit protection or even new characters. As far as I can tell new characters don't impact the gameplay but they help to keep the game fresh. You can also buy coins with real money and the prices range from 99 cents to one hundred dollars. I'm not sure if you really need to buy coins as you get a lot from the game and can earn more by looking at video ads or using social media functions. Just be wary of those in-game purchases if you let your kids play this game.<br /><br />My only gripe with Subway Surfers is the repetitive music. Odds are you will be to focused on the game to notice. It's a great time killer but long play sessions will probably get tedious.
B008NR91DO|5.0|I am a Gary Moore fan.  I would have loved to have seen him live in concert. This video is great, it is a must have for any Gary Moore or for that matter, Jimi Hendrix fan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like to play this app in my spare and extra time.<br />I love how it is really a challanging app not just an easy to beat and can be done in an hour, it lasts a while compared to some other apps! :)
0312117337|1.0|Many people may be unaware that \\"Osho\\" is Baghwan Shree Rajneesh, the self-styled \\"guru\\" who established an \\"ashram\\" in Oregon in the 1980s, and gained notoriety for his stable of Rolls-Royces in a quantity comparable to Imelda Marcos' shoe collection, for bringing in busloads of homeless people in an attempt to fix the vote in a nearby town, and the poisoning of the salad bar at a local restaurant in The Dalles.  Amazon lists the publication date of this deck as 1995, and Baghwan died in 1990, so he personally may have had nothing to do with its conception and execution.  It may be nothing more than an attempt by followers to profit from his name, a fitting tribute to a so-called spiritual leader who, typical of most of that ilk, was as materialistic as the crassest Wall Street hedge fund manager.  As a guide to the higher life, Baghwan's pronouncements were worthless; in addition to his disgustingly opulent lifestyle, he also advocated the euthanizing of disabled children, and his virulent, anti-gay pronouncements rivaled those of the Rev. Fred Phelps and the Westboro Baptist Church.<br /><br />Artistically, the deck is attractive in a sort of New Age bookstore posterish way that some may find appealing.  But that doesn't justify sending any more money to these phonies, differing only from your typical televangelist in their choice of religious denomination.
B009LZDGSI|4.0|I'm a sucker for Sherlock Holmes. I was shamelessly addicted to the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett and the BBC's 'Sherlock' is one of my favorite shows still running on TV. Needless to say I'm enjoying 'Elementary' so far, even if I think there's room for improvement.<br /><br />One big thing 'Elementary' has going for it are the main characters. Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are a terrific team as Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson and their sober-companion relationship (both are recovering drug-addicts) gives a unique dynamic to these familiar characters; Watching Holmes explain his brain functionings to Watson after a sober meeting only to have her counter his ridiculous logic (\\"the brain doesn't even work like that!\\") was a hoot in this episode as well as seeing elements of the traditional Holmes (Watson finding his violin) shine through. I hope there's more familiar elements to come though; I like the idea that Miller is the traditional Sherlock who's completely fallen off the wagon but is now trying to put himself back together.<br /><br />While the character-work by the leads is first-rate in 'Elementary' the mysteries are all over the place, as is Holmes' deductive process. Perhaps it's an attempt to separate itself from 'Sherlock' and 'House' but the randomness (and unlikeliness) of 'Elementary's solutions makes everything feel cheap and artificial. That the supporting cast seems to be phoning it in doesn't help (and while I like Aidan Quinn and Jon Michael Hill I wish they had more to do than butt-heads with our detectives).<br /><br />So two episodes in I still like 'Elementary' even with my gripes. I love watching Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu and it gives me something to look forward to each week. I do hope the show gains a bit more confidence with it's stories and dips a bit more into the Sherlock Holmes canon (we have hints of Sherlock's father....perhaps an alias for his brother Mycroft?). But for now it's a fun enough show with two great main characters (and one awesome opening sequence!).racters (and one awesome opening sequence!).
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Although I have not quite finished the book, I find it extremely well written, and addictive.  A page turner and a MUST read.  Excellent!!
B009WJX10G|2.0|After watching Supernatural since it came out, this episode was one of the worst Ive seen. I found myself mostly uninterested and bored with the premise and nothing about it was a surprise. I have a difficult time staying interested in an episode that has almost nothing to do with the Winchesters. Ever since the Blair Witch Project it seems everyone wants to try their hand at this style of entertainment and it just doesn't do it for me.
B000SVZIGC|4.0|I liked this movie... it wasnt my favorite and it was slow in spots for children but all in all it was a lovely movie with a small historical touch.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 7 year old lives playing it, real close to the Xbox version.  Keeps him busy in the car and waiting at restaurants.
B008NEMN0K|1.0|Yes I,Robot is a very good movie and fun to watch.  but I ordered the movie in 3D and it is by far the worst 3D movie that you can buy.  Where's the 3D in this movie I don't know.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is an excellent movie, both in it's take on a classic tale, and the wonderful artwork! A great transaction, seller, and movie-
B0046H95PO|3.0|I love trying to figure out the whodunnit and Agatha Christie does it pretty well. After watching the TV series, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had stuck pretty well to the book, with a few changes.
B008220BW0|5.0|Here is my own review:  The movie was not only about riding the huge swells of the California coast but about life's ups and downs.. Relationships and having a mentor .. The cinematopghy was sweeping.. Capturing the magnitude of the waves.. The cast was great with Gerard Butler playing Frosty.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|I don't know how many times I have seen this movie, and each time I love it. \\"Having a 'Boo Radley' moment, are we?\\" is a phrase that I will never forget, nor the expression interchange between Juniper and Sam here. He was so nutty and surreal, and yet he was grounded in reality, and worked between the lines with that aspect. \\"Joon\\" was crazy, yet lucid in unique ways that enabled her to see the weaknesses in others and know the why of it. The \\"sane person\\", Benny, was the one who was least 'in touch' with what was really going on in life, although on the surface it would seem that he was the normal one, who was able to do things \\"right\\", to function the way society says that we must. This interesting and complex story brings out the brilliance that can be found in the most unlikely spots of humanity, and the humor that you can find in the most dismal circumstances, if you really try.
0761171703|5.0|Thanks to Amazon, my copy was waiting for me when I got home from work last night. I spent several incredible hours with it, couldn't put it down! Jordan Matter's art is spontaneous, sensual, emotional, and truthful. A background in dance is not needed to get enjoyment from this wonderful book. 5 stars for sure!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very explicit and helpful manual for the do-it-yourselfer or the person who simply desires total control of a project.  I would recommend this book to any of my friends.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|I fell asleep though my husband made it to the end.  Never took off for me even though I lasted at least three-quarters of the way through.  Yawn.
B007THA4FI|2.0|The book was filled with characters who were hard to like.  Perhaps the only person who was a positive force was the character who dies in Chapter 1.  Throughout the first half of the book I often thought of not finishing it, but having paid for it, I kept plugging along.  The second half of the book begins to tie all the characters and loose ends together.  I kept wondering, who is going to die here.  It was obviously coming with all the people in this small town in Britain so self centered, conniving and unhappy.  Very British, I think!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|You should probably stay away from this. You are bound to lose loads of personal time. I can hardly put it down.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is do awesome its all I want to do<br />its so great I got my big bro hooked on it hoot hoot
B004GYY714|5.0|WE HAVE REALLY ENJOYED THE PRODUCT.  IT HAS MADE HEARING DIFFERENT RADIO PROGRAM EASY AND ENJOYABLE.  WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.  WE SPECIFICALLY LIKE HEARING THE BRUCE WILLIAMS TALK SHOW
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this was my favorite game at the fair as a kid and I love it just as much playing it on my kindle fire. an awesome freebie.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|Even though this movie is not one of my top personal favorites, I do see why a lot of people love it. The love story is deep, emotional, and just, you know, Disney. I really enjoy Belle, she's just so beautiful. Yes yes, I know, the message is not to judge people by beauty, but she's also beautiful on the inside. She's strong-willed, independent, and does not let people drag her down. The Beast is also an enjoyable character for this love story. The villain, Gaston, matches the movie's style and message. He's handsome yet arrogant. His plot and henchman make him similar to my favorite Disney Villain, Ratigan from \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\" which I've seen a lot of similarites to. The music is just right for the film, the score AND the songs. The side characters are very memorable; Mrs. Potts the teapot who knows exactly right from wrong, her cute teacup son, and of course Lumiere and Cogsworth. I'm not sure if this movie was also meant to be a comedy, but Lumiere and Cogsworth's time on the screen together is the funniest of this movie. Overall, I understand it's definetly one of Disney's greatest films for good reasons.<br /><br />However, I did not like it as a kid. I thought it was the 2nd scariest Disney movie in my life, behind Aladdin. The prologue was creepy, and the Beast losing his temper scared me, especially when he yells at Belle to get out of the West Wing. That scene scared me the most. And besides, kind of like Little Mermaid, I thought it was too much of a girl's movie with the fairy tale, prince and princess, true love and all that stuff. I just felt more attached to animal- ish Disney films, such as \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\", where there were no \\"stereotypic themes\\".<br /><br />However, despite \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" not having the same impact on me the way it impacted everyone else, I am fairly respecting it nowadays, to watch occasionally. Still not one of my top favorites, but definitely worth watching once in a while.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Another thrilling edition to the heoes of olympus series incredibly well written and its really clever how it all fits up 5***** read
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I love this movie! This is my all time favorite computer animated film! I love pandas, I like tigers, I like vipers, I like Chinese stuff, this movie is so awesome! Plus, I thought it was WAY better than Dreamworks' last movie\\"Bee Movie.\\" I gained an interest in China and pandas a year or two before this movie came out and a lot of it entertained me! Hans ZImmer and Powell's score for this was great, the drama was great, and even the comedy was great too! I will admit, I didn't quite enjoy the way the Five treated Po when he first got to the palace, particularly Tigress, but I like how they changed their minds about him over time. I expected Shifu to hate Po as well and he did know he had to change his ways toward Po when Oogway died. Tai Lung is a pretty cool villain too. He actually reminds me a lot of Shere Khan from \\"Jungle Book\\". I don't know what else to say about this movie. I just love it so much!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I installed this on my Kindle Fire HD shortly after i received it. I haven't had any issues that the others have said. It charges in roughly the amount of time the app says. (The amount of time can be a bit longer.) But I do like the breakdown of time that you have if your playing a game, reading a book, listening to music, surfing the web, etc. I don't plan on getting rid of this app any time soon!
B001AQR3JY|4.0|I really enjoy this movie AND the DVD. It provides me with minimal bonus features, the right amount for me. The movie itself is great. I like how it takes place in wild exotic Africa with absolutely NO humans. Simba is surprisingly interesting as a cub. He's not reluctant to accept being king, he's very eager. Plus, his relationship with Mufasa is not a strained arguing kind. What else I like about this movie is that is starts off kind of \\"episodic\\", like the water hole scene, or the elephant graveyard adventure. But when the wildebeest stampede happens and Simba's father dies, the movie says \\"Okay fun's over! It's time to get down to the real serious part of the story!\\" Timon and Pumbaa are also a fun comedic duo, and the hyenas come up with very good takeout puns. The songs are pretty good too, especially \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King.\\" This is one of the only Disney 2-D movies I approve to be the highest grossing 2-D film in history. This is a product I definetly do not regret buying.
0385535147|4.0|Though John Grisham consistently has improved as a novelist, and not just a legal novelist, in recent years, this latest book is somewhat reminiscent of some of his earlier work. As he has in some recent novels, Grisham uses this story to make some editorial comments about the criminal justice system.  Like \\"The Confession,\\" he is extremely critical of the interview techniques utilized by the FBI, as well as the cost and futility of the \\"corrections\\" system found in federal prisons. Once again, his opposition to the death penalty emerges. He is right on the money (perhaps from his own previous period of defense practice) in focusing on the unlimited range of threats federal prosecutors can employ to encourage a \\"confession\\" if there is a lack of \\"cooperation\\". In my opinion, he is also on target in disclosing how the FBI seeks to outmaneuver U.S. Attorneys through its extensive political influence within the Department of Justice in order to control, and not just support, federal prosecutors.<br /><br />The structure of the book is surprising, because at times it seems like two separate books woven together by a skilled craftsman. The main story, which is quite engrossing, focuses upon someone who escapes federal prison by \\"ratting\\" on a former fellow inmate, leading to some unhappy folks seeking the ultimate revenge. Grisham has not lost his ability to absolutely grab and capture a reader--a skill evidenced in his first blockbuster novel, \\"The Firm,\\" which I (and many others) really could not put down. Here he sends shivers up your spine just with two sentences (on. pp. 161 and 275) that left me feeling like a needle had just been stuck in my eye.<br /><br />Then suddenly, at page 209 or so, it is like we have jumped into another novel altogether--the central character's efforts to manipulate and hoodwink a simple West Virginia bar owner as part of some manner of sting operation. In fact, the antics of the central character and his girl friend reminded me extremelyof similar activities in the \\"Firm.\\" Eventually, 100 pages later, Grisham links up the two stories quite effectively, but the transition between the two parts of the story is not smooth and I found it somewhat confusing until I eventually caught on.<br /><br />Hey, but what else can you say but that Grisham can really tell a legal tale, perhaps better than anyone. Suspense abounds (as do some legal errors) but I whipped through the 340 pages like I used to do when much younger and reading his early novels. This is a great read even if repetitive of some of his earlier work.  Read and enjoy--I did!
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|Well, I don't think this movie is terrible, I don't think it's the greatest of Pixar movies. The choices they made to go with this story are just too dry and made up as it went, like the Mad Libs of Pixar movies. Carl is going to fly to South America in...a house. Ok, err..Carl and Russel face an army of...dogs. There's not enough dialogue, though I admit more than Pixar's last film, WALL-E, but whoever wrote the script was not putting much effort into this. The relationship between Carl and Russel is bland and uninteresting. Carl is a typical old man, and Russel is a typical little boy. I think I have seen this relationship before. I don't mind seeing it again, but it has to at least be interesting ,but it was not. Yes, they have pasts and problems but they're still not interesting. I have to admit Dug's \\"please be my prisoner\\" line is catchy and the alpha's chipmunk voice was funny, but it's not enough to save the movie. Now how about that villain? Charles Muntz the guy who's after a rare bird...wait a minute! They already did that with McLeach in \\"The Rescuers Down Under.\\" McLeach was much more interesting than this guy. And other scenes in this movie are just bland, forgettable, and pointless. I don't hate this movie, I just think it's overrated. Personally, I'd skip this bland forgettable film.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I just keep listening over and over.  I haven't been able to pick a favorite, yet.  Each track is as good as the next.  Worth the price and more. I am glad I didn't wait for the US version. For those who don't know these two teens, check out the video on Youtube where they appeared on Britain's got talent.
B0061QD88S|4.0|This is the best movie about dogs I could ever ask for. The music if good, the fact that it's a simple film about dogs, and the events of the film. I've watched the 1998 Masterpiece tape a lot when I was a kid, and now I find myself watching this DVD a lot, too. Just like \\"The Lion King\\" Diamond Edition DVD, there's a a few minimal bonus features that match my expectations. Tramp is an enjoyable dog character, carefree, but fun and heroic. My 3 favorite parts in this movie are when Tramp fights the alley dogs that chase Lady when muzzled, when Tramp attacks the rat, and when Jock and Trusty (though mostly Trusty) saves Tramp from the Dogcatcher's wagon. Though I really wish people would stop acting like Trusty could have died from the crash; after all, the wheel only crashed on Trusty's leg, not his whole body! Oh well, it's a minor thought. Overall, if you love dogs, a simpler romance, then I recommend this movie to anyone.
B00999VI0Y|4.0|I bought this Bluetooth receiver to breath new life into my original (first generation) Bose Sound Dock which I have for background music and podcast listening.  I have an iPhone 5 and now I am able to stream to this dock via Bluetooth.<br /><br />A couple of things of note:<br />- You can adjust the volume on the source device like an iPhone 5; recommend somewhere in the middle and then use the volume on the dock for the regular volume adjustments.  Do this the dock is plenty loud and will distort if cranked up too loud as with any normal source.<br />- The instructions have a method to do automatic re-pairing and this seems to work with the iPhone 5.<br />- If you have the original dock like I have you will need [[ASIN:B001HN6CVA Scosche passPORT Charging Adapter for iPod & iPhone (Black)]]  to power this device.  Its because the original 30-pin specification transmitted power in a different way and (akin to Firewire) and is the source of the \\"this device is not supported for charging\\" message you see on the screen.<br />- There is some extra hum I noticed and this is reason why I knocked it down a star.  It may be the Bluetooth receiver or the specification or  the environment but I don't get any hum in my car when I stream via Bluetooth so hence the four stars.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|This is my example of a simple Disney film done right! It's not too spectacular or intense, it's just supposed to be a really good movie about cats. I like cats, and if this is the only cat movie I really get sucked into. George Bruns' musical score is as great as always, the villain is up to no good, but not sadistic or brutal, just following a simple plan to get money from his wealthy mistress. My 2 favorite parts of this movie are the dogs' motorcycle chase scene, and the other is Thomas O'Malley's fight with Edgar. I realyl like how this climax is not intense, just an animal attacking a man.This is what the climax to \\"101 Dalmatians\\" should have been like.  I also like how Duchess and O'Malley are alot like Lady and Tramp; a female domestic pet meeting a male love interest on the street, carefree, but becoming a couple in the female's home. Personally, I still really enjoy this movie.

B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I won't review the movie because you can find a plethora of that on the internet. I will add my 2 cents about the 3D. It's pretty amazing. The clarity is great, detail is amazing, and the 3D is eye-popping. Some of the night scenes are a little flat but just a little. The action scenes are done beautifully. If you have a 3D tv, I highly recommend this.
B001GST11O|5.0|I enjoyed the production values on this recording. I was glad that the camera focused mainly on Gilmore while being sure to give nice beautiful closeups on the oh so missed Richard Wright. Its hard to describe Floyd music or Gilmour guitar to a non fan. Let just say that once he starts he could play for 24 straight and you would be so wrapped up in the voice of his guitar you would never know time passed. I'm glad to see that he had such an appreciative and cheerfully vocal audience, yet polite enough to quite down when the next tune revved up Unlike many concert films this ones camera stayed put without twirling all over the stage in case it might miss something. From Zoom far away to closeup it was well done. His voice on the Pink Floyd sets was strong. Shine On You Crazy Diamond was more spoken then sung but I think he meant to do it like that because when it came to comfortably numb his voice was in form again.<br /><br />Turn off the lights put this on and when its down don't forget that you are listening to a master musician who comes around only once in a great while. There are plenty of Guitarist but there is only one David Gilmour. There can only be one.

0385535147|5.0|I bought The Rackateer the day it was released, and I bought the hardback, which I only buy if the author is John Grisham or Jodi Picoult. Otherwise, I frequent our library or buy kindle editions.<br /><br />I started reading this book sitting in the car waiting in a drive thru, and basically could not put it down until I was finished. The times I had to stop reading, I was anxiously waiting to be able to pick the book back up. I have a 10 month old daughter who has a sinus infection right now, and she has been waking up a few times during the night and waking up for the day VERY early. I greatly value my sleep. I do not stay up late reading anymore for ANY book. It's just not worth missing those precious minutes of rest for.<br /><br />I stayed up to read The Rackateer.<br /><br />I read until the early morning hours and finished it within 48 hours of starting it, which is very difficult to do when you have a young child. I literally could not wait to turn the next page and see what Malcolm was going to do next.<br /><br />Loved it. 100% loved it. Gave it to my parents this morning to read while they're on vacation. John Grisham outdid himself!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Fast paced - easy reading without requiring a great deal of attention.  Ideal for reading on a long plane trip when you can doze off and pick up again without missing a beat...
B0091REZMW|2.0|Boring. Also,another game that wants you to pay up. Who are those people who are willing to pay for hints? I don't mind paying for games, but I will Never pay for hints. The game itself is just ho hum. I quit after about  twenty minutes or so.
B0040I09RM|5.0|no issues at all with this product. actually now on season 5 and all prior seasons were just as good of quality as the 1st.
B009VB97EY|3.0|I shake my head because this movie could have been much better. It was boring. The only really good parts were when Channing Tatum was stripping and naked.... which I can die happy now because of but I honestly wish they hadn't cast Matthew Mcconaughey, he wasn't right for this movie and is very unattractive, He should of kept his clothes ON. The girl who played Channing Tatum's love interest was not right for the role either, she wasn't who I pictured him. I wish Adam Rodriguez had a better part, he is a really good actor and very sexy. The thing that made the movie soooo boring was there was barely any music. Any successful movie needs good music and the only time there was any was during the dance scenes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like temple run because its challenging and fun to play with and I really like it because its on kindle fire becuz sometimes some good games on iphone usually don't come on kindle fire so that's why I like it
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|I dont think i've ever been that good with words so how can i describe a movie that is clearly a masterpiece, a work of art, a life lesson, and a beautiful film. I really dont know what to say except to say watch this movie. please watch this movie and someday you will understand. I love the way this movie was filmed cinematography is in itself art. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is breathe taking. Because i cant think of anything else to say ill just leave you with my favorite line from the movie.<br /><br />\\"It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it. Right? And this bag was just dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever. Video's a poor excuse, I know. But it helps me remember... I need to remember... Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.\\"

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Finally, I loved that Mrs Robinson got what she deserved. Ending I could sense that from the turn of the story. Lots of drama in this one, looking forward to the next.
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather has good forecasts.  I like the layout of the current situation.  But the reason I chose AccuWeather over other weather apps is the maps.  For my location te map is more accurate than other apps.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is great. Six heroes who need to work together to save the earth. The 3d part of this movie is great. I watched it 3 times and love it each time.

0544045203|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a quick, thoughtful read, with some charming peculiarities. Just as started thinking about fanciful and light this book was, it started to get vividly grotesque, so queasy beware.<br /><br />I did think the writing style was pretty funny (as in odd and surprising at times). It's written very much like a person telling a story verbally, and sometimes there are comments thrown in that catch me off guard...things that would seem like spoilers if someone was speaking casually to me. But no. It's something like \\"And we started our journey to Canada\\" and then the first sentence of the next chapter, without any other story in-between is: \\"The ship sank.\\" Said so simply and directly... no long drawn out descriptions of the journey before that instance. I liked it. It's refreshing to just get down to the meat of the story sometimes, I suppose. And it fits the age of the main character, a 16 year old boy.<br /><br />The chapters are very short in this book, which makes it great for picking up and putting down when you only have a second to read. The shortest chapter made me laugh out loud, as it was only one sentence long.<br /><br />I especially loved the themes of the novel. Pi is a lovable character...curious and youthful, with a non-discrimiting mind. The way he thinks about animals, humans, religion, and his relationships with them...truly a fascinating mind.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing the movie soon when it comes out! I'm always very curious to see how books adapt to films.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br /><br />I have to say, this book really creeps up on you. I kept finding myself thinking more and more about this book...all of it's symbology, how truly deep it is. Its powerful theme of faith... It's incredible. The more you think about it, the more questions you have, and the more you see.<br /><br />This is one of those books I could read again and again and see more into it each time. It's the perfect book for a class or a bookclub eager to debate.<br /><br />I absolutely adore the forums on this book... this book can mean so many different things depending on who you ask.<br /><br />Incidentally, I just saw the movie, and I thought it was incredible. I thought it did justice to the book, which is a hard goal to achieve. Absolutely stunning.or a bookclub eager to debate.<br /><br />I absolutely adore the forums on this book... this book can mean so many different things depending on who you ask.<br /><br />Incidentally, I just saw the movie, and I thought it was incredible.

B005LLX582|4.0|Terrence Malick's films are not for everyone.  You cannot expect traditional story telling forms, sex, romance, action or any of the other elements that guarantee a blockbuster.  Malick wants more from his audience, and he demands with The Tree of Life.  After watching it quietly I was amazed by the beauty of the film and the performances of the actors.  Penn's part in the film was rather small, and often turned from the camera, so the high praise for his standard wrinkle browed performance puzzles me, but everyone else was brilliant.  Pitt,  Chastain, and especially the children were wonderful.  More specifically young 'Jack' as portrayed by Hunter McCraken.  This young man carries a large portion of the film, beautifully and movingly.<br /><br /> After finishing the film I sat for long time thinking about the juxtaposition of the beginnings of life and the resulting intimacy of life for a human.  I wondered if I had understood Mr. Malick's message, and it's a question that I still ponder.  After all, a director is giving us his own world view.  But one thing I can be sure of; I don't think the viewer was given quite enough information about this family in a small Texas town.  We begin with the knowledge that a son has died.  But we never know how, along with other many small details.  Given the era portrayed, perhaps it was Viet Nam, with the emphasis on his age of nineteen.  If it was, then Mr. Malick overlooked the fact that military officials always come in person with the news, not a hand delivered letter or telegram.  Strangely, I came away more moved by the images of nature's amazing biological forms and a moment of mercy between two prehistoric lives, a precursor to our own.<br /><br />Watch it for its beauty, and because it's unforgettable.
0375507256|5.0|David Mitchell is quite the impressive writer, I must say.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is a wonderful book...6 different stories in different time periods (past, present, and future), all connected in some way. I love how the language and style change from story to story! The author is obviously highly educated in history, language, geography, music, sailing, and about a million other things that relate to this book.<br /><br />I'll admit, this book can be confusing at times...and it leaves you hanging a lot. Since the stories aren't marked with a date and place, you have infer by the clues in the text to figure out what era/place we're in. But, overall, I thought it was very clever and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out next week! At the end of the Nook book, the author wrote about the experience of taking part in the film, and I was delighted to read what he had to say because I myself am a filmmaker. The way he describes a book's journey to film is so perfect... I'll have to go back to copy it and save it for later.<br /><br />If you're looking for an intelligent, high-concept read, this is an excellent choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. It really keeps me entertained throughout my day. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes to use a little brainpower.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|You know it is a great book when you start reading and have to finish the book the same day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its a pretty awesome game its a lot like temple run but somehow somewhat easier and much more fun!?!!!<br />its free too so totally get it! GET IT NOW!!!! :)
B001HN6922|4.0|This was an enjoyable movie, I will probably watch it several times like I did the original. The only downside is like most sequels, it didn't quite meet the bar the first one set. Overall it was a good buy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I want more! I bought the first book for free- it was recommended to me because I love post apocalyptic and existential type reads. After reading the first Wool I had to know more about this world and the people in it. This series would make a great movie. I need to know more- write more books please!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I think that Rick Riordan did an amazing job writing this book.  After reading it i feel like i know all the characters better and, being a percy-annabeth fan, i loved all the time the two of them spent together.  The ending was a lot like the ending in The Son of Neptune.... a cliff hanger, and the next book, The House of Hades, doesn't come out till next year....grrrr.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved Gideon and Eva in Bared to you, this 2nd book continues their story!!  We learn more about Gideon and now I can't wait for the 3rd book,,,
B009UX2YAC|3.0|All my friends have it like I said but um... second review says VERY glitchy if you don't have good battery! love it but it was freezing my kindle! Sorry ill have to give a three.
B009RI4ZKC|2.0|It's a cute film, but a trifling, insignificant one.  Loaded with talent -- Norton; Willis; McDormand; Murray.....all of whom are kinda window dressing on a story of a goofy scout, and his serious-acting girl crush, who run away together.  Charming as the two kiddie-leads may be, I can't recommend it......a quirky film that I had almost forgotten having seen once the credits rolled.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'm not a book reader but I picked up this book and couldn't put it down. I read all 3 books in 2wks. I surprised myself. Love it.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|Channing Tatum shows some great acting & dancing chops in this film, but the plot is fairly formulaic.  Tatum is the next big thing who will take Matthew mcconaughey's stripper troupe to the next level.  He recruits a sexy dope, Pettyfer, to the team....but soon he succumbs to the hedonistic pleasures of the stripper lifestyle.  Pettyfer and his overprotective ( but not very good at it) sister, Cobb, weight the proceedings down with really, really bad acting.<br /><br />Worth the five bucks, but don't expect this one to perch atop your Best of 2012 list.
0385360169|3.0|I do too, but he listens to a lot of audio books and seems particularly offended, but that was before she got to the \\"good parts\\" so we'll see how he feels after that. What really killed it for me is that when she voices Christian Grey, she tries to do a low, husky voice. Oh, i'ts awful. It really is. But if you want in on the trilogy & are compelled toward audiobooks over ink on paper, that probably is not going to stop you, now is it?
B0013O123Q|4.0|What a disturbing movie! It takes a while to get used to the choppy way it was filmed, especially during the beginning 20 minutes or so. The subject matter is disturbing and like watching a train wreck... I was equally repulsed and intrigued.
B007ZI06FE|3.0|I've given the book three stars because it's well written, the characters are well-drawn and there's enough action that it never lags or seems slow. I can't go any higher than three, though, for two reasons: First, the by-now stereotypical idea that having your blood sucked out of your body is in any way erotic and pleasurable. Just can't wrap my head around that, and if I had realized this was one of \\"those\\" types of stories, I wouldn't have bought it. Second, the steampunk elements take a distant back seat to the romance. Remove the few robotic arms and flamethrower attachments and you'd have a Victorian vampire story, period. It's as though the \\"steam\\" in steampunk was reinterpreted here to mean \\"steamy sex scenes.\\" I have no objection to the sexy scenes- they're good- but all in all, I prefer more science in my steampunk fiction. I would have liked more development of the underlying plot: That the virus that turns people into \\"bluebloods\\" (quasi-vampires who feed on blood without killing the donor, but eventually succumb to the \\"Fade\\" and turn into full-fledged, crazed killers) might be curable. Honoria's interest in finding this cure falls by the wayside too many times, and is only given lip service near the end of the book when she finally figures out what the solution might be. There's a sequel, which might develop this part of the story more, but I probably won't read it, as all that blood-sucking has left me a little queasy.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Held off buying the paperback as have had a new kindle. Having already read the reviews of this book I was really looking forward to reading it. I was not disappointed another roller coaster emotional ride. I really felt for each Character and have been left wanting to know more. I really hope the next book gives,the happy ending we all want.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|One word for this game...............EPIC!!!!!!!You get to slay dragons,goblins,and other amazing creatures with upgrades and awesome gear and weapons I appreciate the creators.Im so addicted I play at 12:00p.m to 9:00p.m and repeat I only get 2 hours of sleep thats how good it is.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|great apps. excellent alarm clock. would recommend to my friend's<br />I have it set to music and if music ends it goes on to another feature until I wake. up to turn off the alarm clock. I also like setting it at a different time each day of week.
0385340540|3.0|I found the plot a little weak and also a little incohesive/hard to follow.  I enjoyed the backstory a bit more (about a guy hiding out  in Italy from unknown people who may or may not be trying to kill him).  I actually enjoyed the parts about learning the language & culture so that he could fit it (I'm a student of languages myself, and appreciate the challenges of learning a language).  I enjoyed the book somewhat because of this, but wouldn't rate it as one of his best by any means.  If you're not interested at all in learning a new language/culture and that sort of thing, I don't think there's much in this book for you.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app and how you navigate through the different pages. It does crash a lot though which can be disappointing
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This movie was suspenseful from the beginning to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie.The actors of this movie portrayed believable and realistic characters, which could easily pertain to real life scenario of today's events.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am the kind of person that hates to read but this series kept me up for days. I couldn't put it down until I read all three books. A must read for anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|1.0|I didnt really like this percy jackson book I mean the story was good but with so many vharacters and telling the story in all of their perspective was a little confusing and I think Riordon did a poor job on telling the romance between characters the development was too quick and it got boring as the story continued it was also boring because we know what most of the characters do in this book. it would be better if Riordon kept it a secret by limiting the character's viewpoint to 1 or 2 characters.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|tempest is as good or better than anything he has done since(time out of mind) which he won a grammy for. whats not to like about the bobster.
B0091REZMW|3.0|mystery manor. is a fun game. however there are a limited number of items to find so you end up searching for the same things repeatedly. it idont think I could get too hooked on this as you cant play very long before they want you to spend $ to buy coins or diamonds needed to move along more quickly.

B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have 2 different tablets One android and one Webos and 2 pc,s.This app is on all of them and it was free from amazon. It is my favorite app for entertainment.It has hundreds of stations it seems, I realy don't know for sure,I just have about a half a dozen i listen to all the time.I live in the boonies and it even has several of my local stations on it. But the ones i like the best are the commercial free ones. There are dozens of different styles of music to pick from. each having numerous stations to pick from the music style you like. There are station that play only old style radio with all the old mystery and comedy shows on them.Their is music and commentary from around the world..all for free. I even bought a bluetooth stereo system to use just for this app..Its wonderfull. The quality of playback is excellent also..You won't be disappointed.. I think the negative reviews I see are bogus..  I got it for free but I see the premium one is for .99cents at several places..Can't go wrong for a buck with this one.. If your on the fence,,hey its just a dollar..Give a try I think you'll like it..
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is awesome at first I thought it would be boring but then I got totally addictied to it! A must get app!:{)
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|This is a bait and switch app.. It does nothing unless you purchase the premium one..Just thought people ought to know..
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As usual you can expect the unexpected. I would have liked a little more interaction between Brennan and Ryan but that is the romantic in me. As a Canadian born I always enjoy the descrirptions of the local areas.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|I would have walked out of the theater if I had been in one. My worst DVD purchase ever. Loved \\"Wanted\\" but I think this director peaked there. Amazing to see so many wonderful actors insuch a numbing, souless, bland, mess.
B009UQC7NS|2.0|I love post-apocalypse books and movies, and, like most people here, I also like Zombies. So one would probably conclude that when combining a zombie apocalypse with the end of the world, it would produce a reasonably entertaining television series.<br /><br />But the catch here is that I have to care about the characters and how they deal with the menace.<br /><br />But I don't. In fact, I'd like to see \\"Rick\\" eaten alive as soon as possible so I don't have to deal with his mind-numbing, angst-ridden arrogance.<br /><br />I spend more time wondering whether or not he's going to lose lose it than I do what's going on with the zombies, which makes him a bigger nightmare than all the zombies combined.<br /><br />I also dislike his co-star, Lori, who I find to be just as difficult to like, but in a very different way. In the end, they both ooze melodrama, and the long [seemingly endless] dramatic pauses which feel I'm watching Days of Our Lives make me want to watch commercials.<br /><br />What I want from a series like this is fast-paced action with dialog that is not drawn out to a fault. I don't care that Lori is pregnant with Rick's best friend's child. In fact, I hate the pregnant women characters in action movies period! Because everything becomes so burdensomely predictable. I also don't care that they hate each other. I care that they are written out of the script so we can start with a fresh cast and more exciting plot structure. Falling Skies is a great example of a show with characters I care about, and plot structures that are tight and exciting. But this is not Falling Skies. The first season of WD was the very best of this series, for those who want action at the end of days.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is okay - not a must read but if you have nothing else to do and you are curious how this story continues on from book one; I say read it.  The end of the boook does make you want to pick up book three.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this rating because it sucked i don't know why i read it i must be dumb bye !

B00845MRKE|3.0|... if it's your first final cut Blu-ray collection, if not don't waste money on the tiny booklet and toy car. From the pictures of the product I was imagining the packaging as oversized and the book being much larger, it's not... it's the same dimensions of the Blu-ray case etc. It's tiny and so is the little spinner toy car, the lenticular collectible is nice. Overall it's a decent set of merchandise if you don't already own the previous Blu-ray release. I already own the other basic set so this turns out to be a waste. I honestly thought the art book would be more substantial than it turned out to be. If I hadn't opened it in a blind rush to check it all out, i'd probably return it.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Safe House is a full action film with lots of twists and turns. I like any film that Denzel Washington is in.
B000TERI3O|5.0|I bought the download and it worked exactly as it should. Very easy and has great quality. I then downloaded into my mp3 and I can now listen to Merle on my motorcycle. Perfect!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great!!! my kids live this game. they play it all the time. just like Mario. I highly recommend this game to you.
B005LAII8K|5.0|It's fast, incredibly-well paced, makes sense and delivers.<br /><br />It's visually striking. Perfect use of scifi. Amazing acting (seriously.. put that kid in Ender's Game).<br /><br />This is an almost perfect movie (perfect by my standards, but those are my own).<br /><br />See it. See it twice.
B000001FSP|5.0|An old classic that I can hear again in perfect clarity !! The old album was just to wore out .
1609613937|5.0|Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr and Mary McDougall for this new book. I have been vegan for over a year now, and though I initially dropped 40 lbs by becoming vegan, my weightloss stalled. I have seen several videos on YouTube by Dr McDougall, but was hesitant to restrict my diet further for fear of some nutritional deficiency. This book made everything so clear to me. If protein and fat were the wonder nutrients that we have always been led to believe they are, then Americans would be the fittest and healthiest nation on earth. I have only been following this for one week and not following any of the recipes. I've been eating potatoes, roasted squash, homemade chili, oatmeal with fruit....simple foods from the approved foods list. First thing I noticed was a huge increase in my energy level. I worked a 60 hour week due to staff shortages at the hospital and was worried that the lack of sleep would drag me down. Not so! I have been more efficient than ever. Getting off work at the normal time today, I thought I would want to crash when I got home, that was 4 hours ago and I'm not tired at all. Best part, lost 13 lbs this week!!! Wow! I can't wait to try some of the recipes this weekend. For the work week, I made a huge batch of baked potatoes, roasted squash, brown rice, and chili so that all my food was prepared ahead of time. I have really been testing it with the portions. He tells us to eat until we are full and I have. I don't have any desire for in between meal snacks either. Love, Love, Love this plan and plan to stick with it for life.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Smart, clever. Characters complex and flawed, but true to who they are. Plot intricate and unwinds in a way that makes you think and consider, but never gives anything away.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|This was a huge disappointment...not what one would expect from Follett.  Too much \\"teen\\" type sex and rather poorly written in most instances.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|I was excited to finally get the cd after waiting so long.  I think she is a very talented girl and enjoy her music greatly.  With that said I was disapointed.  I wanted so much more.  I listened to the cd about 4 times and haven't listened to it again.  Needless to say I probably will put it on the shelf and call it a loss.  There was not one song on it that I can remember the lyrics to as I'm writing this. Although I will still be listening to Speak Now and Fearless cause they are great works I just can't say that about this new one.  Sorry Taylor I was hoping for a lot more.
B009KHCT94|5.0|This was laugh-out-loud funny. It is a fun Sci-Fi comedy that may offend you if you are a true Nazi. Who gives a sh*t what their budget was, more room for profit. I really enjoyed this movie even if it never hit theaters in the U.S. &lt;3 Vivian's flip-out!! Glad I bought it instead of renting it, will watch it again.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|Accept are easily the most famous band out of Germany not named Scorpions or Rammstein, and this is the zenith release in their catalog. This cd is filled with the best music the band ever wrote, from the anthem \\"Balls to the Wall\\" to the haunting \\"Winter dreams\\" the ten songs all very from damn good to \\"OMG!\\" Singer Udo Dirkschneider's painful scratchy wail sells the songs with their tales of lust, depravity and desperation. The twin guitar attack would give Iron Maiden and Judas Priest runs for their money. Power metal at it's finest in my own humble opinion...<br />This was a good time for metal, with Iron Maiden releasing POWERSLAVE and Priest giving us DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH around the same time, all three are classics, but this one really holds my attention best. If you love metal and want to experience something new and original, this one is for you.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Recent Grisham story-writing formula:<br />1. Great story for 95% of book<br />2. Unrealistic, unsatisfying ending in last chapter<br /><br />Formula for this one:<br />1. Great story for 45% of book<br />2. Jump shark<br />3. Write about small Caribbean countries<br />4. Implausible wrap up in last few chapters.<br /><br />A lawyer stupid enough to get sent to jail for money-laundering breaks the trust of a fellow inmate, and fingers him for the murder of a prominent legal luminary.  Of course he wants a \\"Get out of jail free\\" card and his lump sum for passing \\"Go\\", and he convinces the Feds to play along.<br /><br />Naturally, he has a bigger game plan, and runs circles around the Feds while he plays an elaborate chess game with several pawns.  Somewhere along the line it becomes checkers as he hops around sacrificing game pieces while racing to get to his goal.<br /><br />Although there's enough to keep the pages turning, the characters are unlikeable and the plot implausible, and this turns a story of theft, greed and manipulation into something that makes the reader feel a little dirty by the last chapter.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 27, 2012
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I bought this movie as a regular DVD and it leapt from my computer screen and kept me in its grasp to the end.  What a production!  Note the hundreds of names in the final credits.<br /><br />Lincoln's special prowess with the axe is a surprising, yet fitting, feature of this unrestrained and fantastical \\"biography.\\"  At least two of the incredible special effects had me rewinding to see them again: the horse stampede and the train.  However, intelligent attention to detail and character development trumped the action, violence and gore in the long run, and there were some special \\"sweet\\" moments.  In real life, I would like to think that Lincoln and Mary Todd had just that kind of relationship.  We are reminded of the value of having devoted and reliable friends, and that aspect never gets overplayed for its own sake in this movie, as the actions do speak louder than the words.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|I love the movie, but the disc set was somewhat disappointing. The bonus features come on a separate disc, and I could not get any of them to work except for the digital copy of the movie. When I tried to get the comic from the Marvel website, the site created my account, then kicked me out of the site. When I logged back in, I did not have the comic book and my code for it had been cancelled. I had no better luck getting my copy of the music or the bonus features.  I ended up having to purchase the movie again from Itunes in order to be able to get the music video, gag reel, and other bonus features.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The absolute, no question, total best buy in the entire watch world. Runs great, looks better, and for anyone interested in learning about timekeeping, it's a wonderful primer for automatic watches. Couldn't recommend this higher.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|The description makes it seem like this is a movie about a triad- Jung, Freud, and Spreilrein. If that was the goal, it falls short. The characters intersect, but not in any dramatic way. What I saw was a movie about the relationship between two giants in the founding of psychology. I found the clash of ideas, the class differences, and the struggle between rivalry and respect very interesting. The diversion caused by the insertion of Speilrein and her sexual and mental health issues was just that- a diversion. It was a topic of sufficient interest to merit it's own movie, but only served to distract from the story told here. What's worse was Knightly's presentation of her. I don't know whether it was her interpretation or the direction, but I have worked in an in patient setting treating seriously mentally ill people and have never seen anything like her performance. It made me want to roll my eyes and turn off the movie. Not only that but her weird accent was off- especially given that she was the only one to attempt an accent at all despite the fact that none of them were Americans. You've really got to create a cohesive picture and when something is that wrong, it effects the whole feel. Is it worth seeing? Yes, if you are interested in psychology or mental health in that time period, but probably not if you are looking to be entertained. It will make you think, but it won't entertain you.
