B0000029LF|5.0|This is perhaps Michael Jackson's most reminiscing album, because it includes all the legendary songs of Jackson since the beginning of his solo career like Billie Jean, Wanna Be Startin' Something, etc. This collectible item will sure be last forever.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love the game but the save me doesn't always work. I've experienced using the save me and it kicks me out of ten game but it's few and far between.
B001GBUD4A|5.0|Ecliptica is arguably Sonata Arctica best album to date. The album is prominent for its mature sound as a debut. In contrary to many other bands' debut, Sonata Arctica wasn't on a path of shifting towards a more mainstream or genre transition, but instead had stick with the same genre since this album.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Works flawlessly.  Just have to figure out some of the buttons as I'm use to the PC reader, but it does what I need it to do!
B002C39TTG|5.0|The Smiths is most legendary for its jangle pop style of Johnny Marr and the deep throat of Morrissey. The vinyl version is arguably the best format out there for listeners to be able to hear everything instrument piece crystal clear. I highly recommend this great collector's item to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this lets me pretend that I have one. I recommend it to most anyone. Just remember to be patient when waiting for tasks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this read ..... twists and turns that I never saw coming!  Kept me engaged the entire book and wanting more!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A great game, especially since it's free. Much better than the first. It includes the ability to level up, you don't have to buy powerups, only upgrade them, and different characters do different things. The only reason I didn't make this a five star is because five means perfect, but believe me, this came close.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is app is awesome! It changes its theme about every month! It went from NYC to Rio! It is really fun! I'm glad I got it!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not what I thought it was  going to be. The  ending made everything else make sense but through the rest it i felt like it wasn't going anywhere. And it really didn't.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This movie was enjoyable, but definitely slow.  The picture quality was great, just don't have think it needed to be 3patient hours long.
B00A12VW86|4.0|Like Uno and Tre, these were solid efforts by Green Day and I was excited to see them tour and had tickets to their show in CO. I am hoping that Billy Joe gets healthy and we can see them perform some of their new songs.
0141040343|5.0|Great quality, love the penguins hardback classics. You won't regret buying these, worth every penny.<br />A great gift as well for any reader, especially a Jane Austen fan.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Pink's best effort from first song to last song by far. Every song is a good song and I was incredibly impressed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead is my favorite band. This is yet another amazing album produced by them. They will never fail to make amazing heartfelt music. I love every single one of their albums.
B009FOBZL0|4.0|I really questioned as to whether The Wallflowers would ever get back together after Dylan left for his solo career. I am glad that they did, as this is a really solid CD.
0141197706|5.0|Great quality, love the penguins hardback classics. You won't regret buying these, worth every penny.<br />A great gift as well for any reader, especially a Jane Austen fan.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|I did not ever think that Evanescence would get back together again. So happy that they did. Solid CD from beginning to end, although some songs sound very similar to each other.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Without going too much into detail about the movie I will say I was shocked how poorly executed the project was considering it's budget.<br /><br />It's basically the continuation or revisitation of Alien (which I never cared for)as it just reveals the origin of the creatures.<br /><br />Overall it was 2hrs of my life which I wish I could get back.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|Like Uno and Dos, Tre is a solid effort from Green Day from beginning to end and gets back to more of their roots. Any Green Day has been good. Each of these CDs would be good additions to your Green Day collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is too addictive I want a second one to come out wish all the characters were free though !
B009FOBMBI|4.0|A good CD by Three Days Grace. Not up to the par of their first 3 CDs. Definitely a bummer that their lead singer, Adam, has abandoned the band immediately after its release.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I don't like having to use this block to review my purchases.  If iut continues this way I will refuse to review
B0099G3I96|5.0|Excellent CD showing the maturity and getting back to the ska and the funkiness of the No Doubt from many years ago. I loved every song on the CD.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|good one. very enjoyable. couldn't put it down. cant wait for more. I love all of your games. want more for kindle fire
B0092SPYQG|5.0|I have followed Papa Roach for years and this probably has to be their best effort from the opening song to the last song.
0307346617|5.0|no book ive read has ever went through scenerios like this does and actually has an ending like no zombie story does.
B009NCM248|4.0|I did not know much about Stone Sour and decided to download all of their CDs because they are touring with Papa Roach and I have tickets. I was very impressed with their unique sound and style. Not like any other band.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was the BEST GAME EVER .A game best for all ages like Temple Run u will love it (:  ............................ My Name is Savi  it's free and fun
B009UX2YAC|4.0|i mean this is a good game and all but my game glitched up twice! i lost all my coins,characters and my high score! im really mad that this happened because i had this game for a long time. my warning is to be prepared to lose some things!
B00AREIAI8|1.0|we installed this game for my kids. it worked the first time we played it and never again. we have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it still wont work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This final book, like the others was filled with suspense, bravery, action and romance. I couldn't put the book down. Such a wonderful read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game, I'm so addicted to it. It is sometimes glitchy though but I give it a five star rating.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Jennifer Laurence is superb. The plot is interesting and keeps you wondering. Not your predictable suspense film at all. HIghly reccomend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Totally love this game. Its fun and addictive. My dad even got catch up in the game so it proves to be an amazing game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing story.  The words flowed of the page and made you hungry for more.  This was my first book by college Hover, but definitely not my last.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is wonderful.  I can't seem to get enough.  This is a must play game. Very addictive. I look forward to the daily challenges and the missions.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Corrected the problem with the kindle not charging for now. Hope this is all that I'll need for the kindle. Thanks!
B007THA4FI|1.0|How do you top Harry Potter; you don't! I was so looking forward to Ms. Rowlings New book; something new, fresh, different, a departure from Harry (though I am still going through \\"Harry Potter\\" withdrawals books and movies; though books rule!!!). Pre-ordered Casual Vacancy on my Kindled and waited; when I received it I wanted to dive right in, but personal matters prevented me from doing so. It was total agony; though during my wait I began to hear rumors of disappointment over the book. No longer could I wait, leaping head first, locking myself away, not to be disturbed until further notice. My joy was short lived, after a few chapters my mind began to wander,to a grocery list, laundry, etc., anything but the book I was trying to read and rarely ever do I get sidetracked when reading. I'd been ill, so I decided to put the book down and wait a few days refresh and feel better and begin anew. So three days later I attempted to try again, and again I just could not get into Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />It's as if I'm reading two entirely different authors, because the person who wrote the incredible books about a boy wizard named Harry Potter and the person who wrote Casual Vacancy seem to have two different writing styles. Yes, I understand it is supposed to be completely different, BUT NOTHING flows in this book, it makes no sense, the language is aweful, like she's trying to make up for what she didn't get use in the HP Books.<br /><br />To finish my diatribe; Jo, I DO love you, but this one was not your next best. I am still a fan even at 50 yrs old and am praying for your next great story idea. In the mean time I will try for the fifth time to finish Casual Vacancy, it has become a quest now, though a tough one.
B001UAX56A|5.0|This albulm is absolutely amazing. Lauryn's ryhmes against her smooth melodic voice is a great combination. She talks about real life & relationship issues on this album. It proves to be a timeless body of work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game but sometimes it get stuck so you have to go out and restart the game. I highly recommend it.
0061367036|5.0|Supernatural is a great show. This book helps adds to a great experience by expanding on the universe. It details things that Sam have Dean hunted in the show, along with entries on other monsters and demons the brothers faced. There is an interesting section on the names of different demons and another section on plants that have magical qualities. If you are a fan of this series this book gives fans a fun look into the lives of their two favorite hunters.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved the WWII history and the character development. I did reread the last fifty pages of the prequel before beginning this one to refresh my memory of the storyline from first book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is epic I don't no y the first one ist as good if you no wat I mean. Heck yeah this game is awesome.PS WWE rules
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I have to watch this movie during the Christmas Season.  It is my tradition.  I can really relate to some of the things in this movie.  I know that sounds scary, but it makes me nostalgic especially since most of my family has passed away.  This movie makes me happy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the storyline, love the actors, and their ability to portray the writers story effectively. The cinematography and period costumes just adds to this series watch ability.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|This doesn't work on kindle fire. I am very disappointed . I should have been told.I want a refund. thank you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the story line. Kept me reading til the end!..  Can't wait for the the third book!.. This is a Justin your reading list!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book overall, it was suspenseful and kept me guessing for a good portion of the book.  I thought some of the details once the jig was up were overkill.  I thought there were some obscure words used mid-sentence that were wholly unnecessary.  Perhaps a person smarter than I would appreciate the use of uncommon words for common things/situations, etc. but if I cannot figure it out in context, I prefer not to see it in my fiction novels.  Save it for non-fiction, but that is just me.  : )
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Finally a book about a hot, bad boy that finds someone to bare his soul to. Raw emotions, bad attitude, and throw in a good fight(s) that's what make this book THAT good!
B00355L2TU|5.0|The reason I like this workout is because it works you really hard, but for only about 30 minutes. I can usually talk myself into doing this video because it's so short, but it gives results.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so cool i love it it is so easy to play it is never blurry vhhvc fghhhjh ghjjbvg ggvhhhbvvvvvvvvgh bhhghhhhbvvvg ghgg
B004SMD4H2|2.0|the way the disks fit into the holders is terrible! You have to bend the disks just to make them fit and I live in fear that I will snap a disk in half if I am not super careful. This has to be the worst disk packaging I have ever seen, and I own MANY DVDs and Bluerays. The 2 stars is for the packaging.... the show in its self is amazing and I would give it 4 stars if there was a spot just for the show its self.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The pace of this book is like a murderous  avalanche! Killing Floor definetly delivers on time, from the first chapter to the last. It will be hard to put down!!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The packaging is fab, the show is fab, and due to a machine error I have 2 disk ones! Now, just to clarify, I have all the other disks as well, but the 1st disk had a double setting on top of it. At least I have a back up!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this app but it didn't work on my kindle fire so I had to buy the $2.99 version and that worked for a while but now I cant get to my account:( u should get this app but not for kindle fire Bc it doesn't work:(
0765356147|5.0|The Hero of Ages is probably one of the best fantasy books I've read in a long time. I recommend it to anyone who has read the first two and anyone else should read the first two books before proceeding to this one. As a whole, however, the series is incredibly satisfying and the final volume is probably the best of the lot.<br /><br />As far as plotting goes, Sanderson is a master. Plotlines are incredibly compelling and progress at a reasonable pace. The main action is split into three or four different plotlines from the PoV of different characters throughout the world. Sometimes, I felt disappointed when the PoV would switch to a different character, as I would be so engrossed in one character or plotline that I did not want to leave that character. The tension and rising of dread is insane and it is impossible to know until the ending how things will resolve. There are plenty of revelations that answer most of the burning questions of the series, along with a number of twists that come out of nowhere.  The ending was incredibly satisfying, even as it left with me with more questions.<br /><br />One of Sanderson's greatest strengths is his ability to create unique and engaging worlds and the Mistborn trilogy is no different and this is easily the biggest strength. The world, its history, and its systems of magic are absolutely fascinating to explore. Especially engaging is the explanations provided for many of the secrets of the Mistborn world.<br /><br />The characters are generally complex, well-plotted, and sympathetic. However, there are a few characters that get short shrift in this book that had the potential to blossom into more major characters, or at least into deeper ones. Allriane in particular is rather stagnant, which is unfortunate as I believed her to be one of the more interesting additions in Well of Ascension. There are some serious deaths in this book and you will almost certainly feel sad for their passing, which speaks to how Sanderson has built up these characters over the course of the novels.<br /><br />Sanderson's writing is utilitarian and functional; it is the story and world that drive this novel forward, not his ability to write.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first two books, you will not be disappointed; Hero of Ages fulfills the promise of the Mistborn world and makes you sad to leave its misty, ash-ridden confines.
B003NWS5AO|1.0|Hoping for something much more up beat. The Majority of the music felt weak and labored to end with exception of Silva, I would pass on this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I chose it because I loved this book. I did not dislike anything about this book. I would recommend this book to someone who likes the hunger games and who likes suspense.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The DVD works great! Love the movie too. Very happy with the product which came factory-sealed. Very good quality movie/DVD. No worries.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is pretty cool! I just wish that the characters cost less. Overall it is pretty good! :)
B0001WE6U2|5.0|This is the original replacement lens hood for Nikkor lenses. Just like the one that came with the original lens. Great product.
B005HSL626|3.0|It was not what I was expecting, but it's a good free app.There's nothing wrong with it I just didn't really like it as much as some other apps.I got bored of it after a few times of playing it. I don't know how helpful this review is, but it's just my opinion.
B008JH5HCW|1.0|This was actually painful to watch. I was so glad when it was over! Normally, when I hate something this much, I just turn it off and never go back, but I gave this one a chance and watched it all the way through.<br />The writing was awful, the characters completely one-dimensional, and I even felt sorry for Guy Pearce (I like him as an actor, but what the hell was he doing in this travesty?!) and the idiotic \\"chemistry\\" they tried to build between him and Maggie Grace's character.<br />I could see the potential in this movie, which I think is why I kept watching...hoping it would get interesting. The only time I was remotely entertained was when it was finally revealed what Guy Pearce's character's first name is. But even that was trite and contrived.<br />This might have been better in the hands of a better director, and I thought I saw Luc Besson's name in the credits...if he had directed it, it may have been better. But still, the dialogue was so freakin' lame it was unbearable, and I doubt even the most talented director could have saved it.<br />I can't recommend this movie to anyone, and all I can say is STAY AWAY!<br /><br />You have been warned...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This has been on  of the best books I have read in a while.  If you had any gaming console in the 80's, you will get a kick out of this book. If you like some of the iconic pop-culture movies of the 80's, you will get a kick out of this book. If you like some reference to some 80's music, you will get a kick out of this book. Great characters, creative writing, I just wish Ernest Cline had another  one out there as I finished \\"Ready Player One\\". Thoroughly enjoyed it, couldn't put it down. WELL done! There has got to be a movie and I want a part in it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|and it is free, more than I expected easy to use, very user friendly product with must have features...yes a must have
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Many hours of free fun. They give you enough stuff to earn to keep things fresh. The graphics, controls, and game play are top notch.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Great story of great men and their experiences.<br /><br />I don't understand why you must use a certain number of words in order for your review to be submitted.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the original and this is definitely an improvement. Better graphics, new obstacles, just as addicting. I would recommend this for anyone.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Arrived on time. Every song is a hit. I couldn't love this CD any more if I tried. And I liek that it's not a hardcase cover.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We like this series. Seems to work well now, but the first night we purchased we were not able to view it.<br />Quality is good, no problems now.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's an okay game I like how you can get a game that you want to open. I also like the fact that you earn money by playing games...
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this movie is really cute/you have to like these type of movies to enjoy this movie. There was a good lesson taught for children in this movie also. (Be careful what you wish for--well most kids, the daughter  (princess) turns her mom into a bear and her dad is a BIG bear hunter!!) But I like animated movies and it was good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is my favorite game on kindle fire and it works great! The graphics are amazing and the controls are simple for all ages. There are no glitches so you can play non stop. The characters are cute but a little pricey, still an amazing game
B004G600A4|5.0|again I really like animated movies and this is cute movie. Not for everyone BUT it's cute. My type of movies.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Fun game to play my zoo is huge now.. I rescued a lot of animals which means a lot of cash to update your zoo and make it much better.. love this game pretty cool game
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|I don't regret buying it BUT nothing to write home to mom about, If you like Seinfeld -- which I do. It was okay
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I think its great. It blocks out outside sounds so you can concentrate on the music itself. And you can hear the underlying texture of the song and not just the overall beat.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this app is awesome I have used it now for over three months and it has not failed me yet! I love the music feature and it is easy to use.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and I play this game everyday!!! This game is also some like temple run because you can change your person and everything!!!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|While reading this book you might think...\\"this is so interesting!\\" or \\"I wonder what's going to happen!\\" or \\"How is this all going to be resolved?\\" But then you get to the end and you will most certainly be thinking, \\"I wasted my time reading this entire book for THAT?!?!?\\" You will be left feeling disappointed, cheated, and just generally pissed off. It seems as if she got the to end of the book and just gave up during the last 20+ pages. She didn't care anymore and that's obvious. For a book that gets you extremely invested in the characters it is an EXTREME let down. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. Spare yourself!!!
B00B7G3BUW|5.0|The movie wasnt what i expected it was even better. i would watch it over and over again. will definitely rent it again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Thiz app glitches too muchand the prices are too high to buy characters but its a great game overall a
B00006FMAW|4.0|One of those movies that I, quite a seasoned fan of horror of all kinds, found very unique and unusual. A graphic thriller type with social commentary...not fitting in was definitely a dangerous thing in this \\"society.\\" If only horror still had this kind of imagination today instead of being redundant and mostly all remakes. The orgy scene at the end is obviously called the most disturbing part of this film, but there are plenty of what-the-hell? images here. Definitely something I would watch more than once. Lastly, are people really serious about the prices for this movie? $299.99?!! Are you out of your damn minds?! It's a MOVIE! If you're charging that much, the disc should be made of pure gold! $60 is still kind of nuts. I know it's kind of rare, but seriously, quit ripping people off you movie nerds. Sheesh.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this game for my 2 year old daughter whom loves horses...I'm impressed on how fun it is for her and me as well. we both play it and genuinely love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfers is not very interesting but very adictive if you like temple run,temple run 2 or brave you'll love this
B000U0O9FM|5.0|First off, i had such a good time reading this book. I vaguely knew the story from seeing the movie a while ago (which I also really enjoyed). After reading the book I can't stop telling my friends how much better the movie is after you've read the book. There's things in the movie that just blow by really fast that have so much more back story that make reading the book worth any Fight Club fans time. I myst say this was more of a work of art than a book with the reoccurring themes and memorable phrases dispersed through the book. I also think if you have trouble getting through books, this is a really good one to get you in the mood and really amped to read (as foreign as that feeling may be to those don't read often)
B006C67NP6|3.0|Wonderful aid to the jazz musician. Took me several hours to download, as instructions, which they call a tutorial, are totally inadequate.  Very frustrating experience. They need to talk to customers and revise the download instructions start to finish from the customer's viewpoint. In the end, I'm happy to have these 3000 gig-ready tunes on my PDA.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty good even though it shut down for a week or more .... But it is worth the wait you should get it thumbs up!!
B00B2166BS|5.0|After getting spoiled with the wireless charging with an HP Touchpad (it runs great with Cyanogenmod Android on it), I couldn't imagine using another tablet without it. But this POGO charger is the next best thing to wireless charging. It magnetically clamps on to the tablet and charges faster than a micro-USB. The first time around it seems like I had barely turned around and my Nexus 10 was at a 100% charge again !
B004QX07G4|5.0|I really loved this book! So funny and easy to read. Couldn't put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Maybe I'm not the best one to judge, as I LOVE Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol in just about any shape or form.<br /><br />This is a good movie, though.  You can really see Jim Carrey in the animation.  They've done a great job.  Nice to see a &#34;new&#34; version of this classic.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I like the idea that there are so many different games you can play, but I guess I didn't expect them to be so short.
B007G51UV0|5.0|I built a new system:<br />i7 processor, 32GB RAM, this motherboard, 1 SSD drive, 5 SATA drives, Cooler Master HAF XM 932 Case, Seasonic X750 Gold power supply, MSI GEForce GTX 650 1GB OC and Windows 8 64 bit.<br /><br />I have had zero issues.  It has worked flawlessly from unboxing on. In fact, all of my hardware and software has had zero issues. Fully updated, everything is installed and working like a dream!<br /><br />I highly recommend this board!
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I like to play this one quite a bit but I have recently gotten to where I cannot expand my restaurant any more until I invite friends to be my neighbors...I have no friends that play this game : (
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Another entertaining volume in the series.  After five, you would think he could bring the story to some sort of closure?!  Alas we still await the conclusion of this saga.
B00A03WBVI|5.0|They are so adorable and the music is definitely meant for the target audience, screaming seven year olds and teens.
B006LSZECO|3.0|i really had high hopes for this and why the psychology behind it and writing was stellar, i felt like it just &#34;ended&#34; and i hate that empty feeling when you feel like there should be more but there is not.  anyway....it was interesting for quite a while but the lack of climax or resolution ruined the entire experience for me.  don't bother.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Very sweet story. I enjoyed the characters and their depth. The ending was perfect for the inevitable fate of the characters.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I love this show. We bought the first season so he could catch up. Another great series from USA
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was not just outstanding, but out of this world. It made me cry and smile at the same time. John Green, you are now my favorite author. I love your writing, it is emotionally beautiful. I hope to read more of your books, such as;Looking for Alaska and Paper towns.
B00573YVVY|4.0|.DREAMS FROM MY FATHER by barack Obama.<br /><br />A good title, understood by the end of the autobiography.<br /><br />Obviously a ghost writer was not used as It is not well written.  Perhaps the portmanteau words are acceptable in the US but I found them off putting. The story is told in a simple chronological mode, quite gripping at times. The introductions to the editions are fascinating and worth reading on their own.<br /><br />Obama's recall and interpretation of early events as well as what he was told then and later is clear and credible, if confused as it would be.  His account of growing up black in a white household without a father is heartbreaking and hilarious. It aroused memories of my growth in awareness of colour prejudice in Australia and that of my children. I was laughing aloud at Obama's teenage and young man antics when he tested rebellion; smoking, drinking, drugs, hanging around, dropping grades.  What is new except that he is black and trying out another world. And that he became President of the the US. Throughout this time he had images of his father which varied in depth and accuracy.<br /><br />Things become more confused when Barack travels to Kenya and meets the surviving relatives of his family. Barack strives to get to know his father through his sister, brothers, aunts, uncles, grandmothers and people who had known his father. We hear different and conflicting stories.<br /><br />It is at the graves in Kenya or the wedding to Michelle that we see that the search for a father is over. Perhaps we see it more in Roy who has accepted his African name and heritage.
B004Q0SQ24|4.0|My son loves theses train characters however they are too tall to fit under the wooden train bracket bridges that we have ( not chuggington brand)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|making me wish I had a horse. Ive always wanted a horse since I was a child. well very fun game

B00B2V66VS|3.0|The app is great. I love the graphics and it's just as addicting as Temple Run but after about a week the app just stopped loading on my kindle fire. It will not even load to the play page. I was so excited when I first downloaded it because I absolutely loved the first one and I am having no issues with the second one on my Iphone but I am disappointed that it is not working on  my Kindle.<br />I finally removed it from my device and re downloaded  it and wound up losing all of my upgrades. Not very impressed at this moment.

B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.<br />It's so well written, it's simply captivating. It's so easy to become so invested in the characters that it just drives you crazy when something goes wrong

B000SEIDR0|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma is a book I would not have gotten on my own.  I never even heard of it before.  I had to read it for a major research paper for college.  At first I did not like it, but once I got into this book, (and it didn't take me long), I did enjoy it.  This is a book I would recommend anybody to read.  You know where the writer is coming from and it has great detail that literally takes you to what the writer is speaking about.  In the opening the writer is speaking about a farm job he had and how the work is very hard and he has shed a whole new light on farmers and their everyday work they have to do in order to keep up with their farm.  How there is never a day off.  This is a &#34;MUST READ&#34; book for sure.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|screw who ever made this this game takes up to much space i cant even DOWNLOAD IT it is soSTUPID
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have never read a book that gripped me as much as The Book Thief has. It's a wonderful blend of hopes and fears and colors and emotions that left me virtually clinging to every word - I didn't want to miss a single thing. Or thought. Or exquisitely painted picture.<br /><br />This book isn't just another war story - it's an entire experience.  I feel like I lived it; it was so vividly portrayed. You're there. You feel it.  You know the characters - you feel their hope. You feel their despair.  You feel their words.<br /><br />I know this sounds like a mash of random words and thoughts - there's a reason I'm not a writer. But I AM a reader - and this book, out of the thousands of books I've read through the years, is the one that will stick with me.<br /><br />It's a must read in my opinion. I know you'll love it.
B008OJIBH8|5.0|I love this item since i am big on aliens ufo stuff the ship is a good size and made well and plays the theme song from E.T.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game that I have ever played on my tablet. This was the awesomest game I have played

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|One of the best books that I have read recently. I felt like I was on the journey with her. I read this book over the course of 36 hours. I couldn't put it down except for the fact that I bought it on Thursday night and had to take time out to work on Friday. It's almost like I have met Cheryl. I am considering going on a backpack adventure on PCT myself!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think this is a great game but it is easier then the the first temple run .still you should get this game.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm finding this series to be totally addictive. I love the costumes, the scenery, the characters, and of course, the story.  This season has some reolutions, and more surprises. I couldn't stop watching  episode after episode.  My husband and his Suppers, or lack therof, are grateful I finished.<br /><br />I don't know how I will wait  a whole year for the new season.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Good graphics and game play.  Familiar to playing Mario.  Have only played a few levels, but I will continue to play it
0060786523|5.0|Just today, at a junk shop, I bought a hardbound copy of this book, which I read maybe five years ago in soft cover, a task sort of like trying to eat a spiral-cut cantaloupe: doable, but not recommended.<br /><br />When I first read *A Suitable Boy*, I was reading a lot of Indian fiction. I had just read *A Fine Balance*, and had convinced myself that Indian fiction was the finest fiction of the day: heartbreaking without schmaltz, rendered in language uncluttered and beautifully transparent without suffering the usual reduction to bourgie NewYorkerese deracination, delicately aware of the power of family without lapsing into the tedium of social socalled science or into rituals of bitchery about being misunderstood.<br /><br />I like long books, but even so, I wondered about 1488 pages devoted to discovering a \\"suitable\\" (merely that?) fiance, I assumed. I dove in, built up a good head of steam (1488 pages!), then slowed down, then slowed down again. To read this book is to share the lives of its characters, and what foolishness to rush through something that,like life, however long, is over all too soon!<br /><br />I love this book, and so I am thankful that I am old enough that I have forgotten most of it, so that I can live through it all again with the same sense of discovery I felt the first time through.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love it.  If you liked the first album from Mumford and Sons, you will love this one too.  More of the same great music.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|All games should be this fun. Great graphics, sound effects, and music. Looking forward to part 2! I downloaded the game when it was the free app of the day but will gladly buy the sequal on day one.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|This was a very pleasant read, not as thought-provoking as expected, but well- written, a bit of a tearjerker but not overly sentimental, actually despite somewhat sad ending, left me feeling optimistic!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a decent time killer. a bit annoying that u have to replay old games to get enough points to open new games.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game for kids. Helps teach animal responsibility without the actual mess. I recommend this app to parents with young kids.
B0085157B8|1.0|Don't even think about buying this. Quite ossibly one of the worst creations mankind has ever been able to make.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This novel is worthy of its readers' time because of the manner in which Rachel Joyce paints one man's struggle to come to terms with who he was and who he will be. It does not preach. It's agenda is to vividly portray Harold Fry's personal developmental struggles and moments of truth.  It deftly balances the heaviness of family relationships with lightly comical scenes. It is a book easily put down but eagerly picked up again.<br /><br />The author weakend the story by having Harold walk too many repetitive miles.  Harold's wife's journey to an epiphany within their relationship was not adequately substantiated by the author.  The story's climax was somewhat contrived.  However, despite these weaknesses, its strengths made it an entertaining and moving read.
0143117009|5.0|Jared Diamond tells the fascinating story of past societies that are long gone, however the moral of those stories is very applicable for today, as the world becomes a global village. if we want to survive in this world - we have to learn from mistakes of the past and how societies that refused to change eventually brought the end upon themselves. they disappeared not because an external enemy but because of their own actions.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|I purchased this app last month because I loved the screen shots; I was really unhappy to find that the ones I specifically wanted WERE NOT INCLUDED. Uninstalled,<br /><br />Today I thought I was not being fair -so l downloaded again.<br />This time I have download protection that lists ALL<br />permissions!,<br /><br />This app requests to send email.to your contacts without your knowledge !. SHAME!! Reporting to Amazon.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|You must see these guys on video to fully appreciate their energy. Hopefully they will be around for a long time.
B009MO5960|5.0|I enjoyed every second of it. Unfortunately always there are people who ruin movies with their one dimensional reviews and point of views. This movie is based on a video game lets not forget about it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice, quiet, calm game for anyone looking to pass the time away in a relaxing manner. Good for everyone including young children and older folks. Spend time with your horse, feed it, groom it, clean the yard, etc and earn coins and gems to buy treats and other goodies. Work your way to a horse show, and/ or buy more horses and different locales.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|Out of the PC into the E17 dac then out of the E17 and into the E9K desktop headphone amp, and out of the E9K via banana plugs and into the AUX in inputs of an Onkyo receiver. You'll either have the cops at you front door or neighbors toting beers thinking there's a party going on. lol
B00992CF6W|3.0|the game is incredible and a real joy to play.  I only wish it would hurry up and update on amazon the other app stores have allready received the updates and I'm no longer happy playing we need new equipment we need the game to update
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have had a lot of fun playing this game.  It is so much fun to play solitaire without any shuffling or dealing.
B001PPGAJE|5.0|Hugh Jackman as the wolverine...need I say more.  This is a pretty good super-hero film.  I love that they finally put it in Blu-ray.
0525421580|1.0|I don't know how you ever got the good reveiws on this book.  The chapters written in little type were hard to read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great plot, characters, dialog, setting.  I only wish the US television industry could develop similarly compelling series that offered solid plots, great writing, brilliant acting...and didn't rely on sex, vulgarity, and ultra-beautiful models to carry the show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever made. spend hours playing this game. so many things to buy and unlock. everyone should play this game
B006LSZECO|3.0|Plot was slow to develop.  Failed to captivate.  I never really liked or hated the major characters...which is important to me.  Disappointed.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|this is a very great figure and is well worth is price. it comes with faces hands and is just an all around good figure only problem is that if u think this figure will be around a 6-7 inch figure u will be mad because it is around 6 inches to the top of his hair
B003Y5RLR8|5.0|Elvis on Tour- This was a great film. The audio and video looked great. What an incredicle peak into the Kings world.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Only start this book when you have time, as you won't be able to put it down!!  From the first page to the last, I was on an emotional roller coaster ride - I laughed and cried and smiled and blushed - many times on the same page!  It starts out feeling like a great romance novel and ends up so much more - It was amazing how the author wove such serious, mature subject matter into a young lover's new romance.  Just like a good roller coaster, this story will keep you anxious to know what lies on the next page, but also not wanting it to end. Can't wait to read more from this author!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|The entire album is fantastic.  I guess Adele's 6 Grammies speaks for itself.  I bought a Mini Cooper<br />convertible just after I got this and I will always think of her when riding with the top down.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|my friend loved it squeezed the s*** out of me thanks alot it made her happy and that made me happy.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I love books that reel you in right from the beginning. This one did that for me. It was sad, but never sad enough that I cried. I think it would have been better if it had brought out more emotion. I didn't like the parenting style at all. The mom and dad allow their daughter to drink, have sex in the house and stay out all night long. Because the book portrays these activities as acceptable for a kid, I don't recommend it for your teenagers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very fun to play when you're just sitting around doing nothing. I really enjoy it as you jump and slide on the trains
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE sudwaysurfer because it is a game that you just can't stop playing and it is a challenge that I LOVE
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game really good I recommend it hugely it is absolutely amazing get it right  now no seriously right now

B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun!! Why do you think I'm up at midnight playing!! I can't sleep :]<br />I'm just so addicted! ¥® since my brother showed me this and I immediatly downloaded it on my kindle!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how much I loved this book. Colleen Hoover is a terrific writer, I loved her previous work, but with Hopeless she went above & beyond any expectation I had. Hopeless is a beautiful yet terrifying story about a girl, it gave me hope at the end of the day, but it also made my heart wrench with the harsh reality Sky had to go through. It's hurtful, sicking and even disgusting, but Colleen Hoover did a fabulous job bringing the characters and their emotions to life, justifying their actions, and giving them a good ending.<br /><br />  Sky was the most strongest and bravest person I've ever come across. She's funny, sarcastic, easygoing, and just full of life. I loved that she wasn't too serious with her life, and had fun with it. Breckin was the best gay friend ever in the whole wide world. Enough said. Karen was the sweetest mother ever, I loved that she wasn't very strict with Sky and let her do what she wanted but still kept her weird rules. Six was the biggest slut in town & proud of it. You always need friends like her who will keep you grounded. LOL. Holder. Holder. Holder. Now, he wasn't any prince charming, but black knight works great sometimes. I loved him! He had his Travis-moments in the beginning, but it all made sense as we get to know more about him. Holder was Sky's rock, her supporter, her confidant, and her forever. Their relationship was beautiful, a little rough a times, nevertheless a one that was meant-to-be.<br /><br />  Hopeless is one of the best NA I've read this month, and I highly recommend everyone who love that genre to give it a go. I'm so glad I read this book, and the only complain I had was not reading it the day it was out. Shy & Holder deserves their story to be read, so don't miss it out!<br /><br />  PS: This is probably the vaguest review ever, but I didn't want to spoil anything for you.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|U should be able to buy things with coins or gems. It is a fun game other wise with great graphics.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|SO much more than I even hoped for from these three songwriters - a perfect blend of talent - memorable music

B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a great game where you can build anything but every other device has 6.0 except kindle. I love this game it is awesome, just needs an update
B00B2V66VS|5.0|omg the only thing I can say is swaggers I love the graphics this is the fest game ever buy it
B001BANK32|5.0|A great book and masterful storytelling, a true testament to the innocence of a child; and a triumph of the human spirit, the shining takes its reader on a ride through hell and back, if you are disturbed by blood and Gore this novel is not for you, if you are offended by excessive vulgar language this novel is not for you. Now my advice to you if you are not disturbed by those two aspects, read this novel it is a true masterpiece
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I love this movie and haven't seen it in the longest time! It plays just fine in the DVD player too.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game sucks, after I collect 2500 coins, it starts me all the way back at 0.Good thing this game was free because it's worth nothing.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game of its kind. I play with my friend always making sure that they dont beat me. subway surfers has a world tour so it changes. Love Subway surfer
B004IJY4L0|2.0|I purchased this under the misapprehension that this was electronica of some sort. Amazon's recommendation system as well as other reviews steered me wrong, this time.<br /><br />In fact, it is a truly bizarre mix of styles that varies so much from one track to the next that the album itself is nearly unplayable as a mood piece. Individual tracks may find their way into your playlists, but this is not an album I can imagine listening to from beginning to end more than once.<br /><br />First of all, there are vocals. If you listen to electronica for those times when you want music without vocals, this is not your album. The vocals themselves vary from early art rock style to guttural metal styles. Nothing on this range is particularly pleasant or inspired, but it's not poorly done.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the musical style itself which ranges from orchestral to electronica and back into the seventies again.<br /><br />Kansas meets Flock of Seagulls? Yes meets Metallica? Boston meets Juno Reactor?<br /><br />Individual tracks are interesting, and, if you don't mind the retro feel with anachronistic future references, it is a sort of musical time-travel adventure. But as a whole, it does not hang together well.<br /><br />And it's definitely not electronica.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is so fun. It makes you feel like you actually are taking care of a horse.<br />It doesn't require any of those games where of you don't check up on it, it expires.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Unable to update app on S3. Update is broken. Tried it multiple times. But unable to install the new update.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Amazing game, but sometimes glitches and uses my jewels then foreclosed without me being able to save myself. All in all great game jus please fix the little problem
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|This game is a major hit in our house.  It would be nice to be able to do subtraction too.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is good and informative on the current and upcoming weather. Has every county and is convenient when in hurry and need weather details! Worth the download..
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This movie is a great movie. I had just recently watched it on television. I had never seen this movie advertised until a short period ago. I am glad to have it in my collection.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|As I stated in my review of Season One, I am amazed at the picture and sound quality of these disks.  The difference between these and the Standard Definition disks is nothing short of amazing.  I will have all seven seasons as soon as they become available.  These are worth the price and the enhanced sound and picture surely increase the pleasure.  If you are a Trekker as I am, then these are a must have for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Quick read. Very good story line. Loved the varying viewpoints. Read w a group of coworkers and we can't wait to go see the movie!
B00006J9OT|5.0|I can't get enough of Diana Krall. I didn't realize that she was playing the piano AND singing until I saw her live. Krall's music is in my &#34;happy place&#34;.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game! Reminds me of the online game just like it. Hard to beat brutal mode. But definitely recommend =)
0979019710|5.0|Hal Elrod's energy is contagious.  It emanates from the pages of his books.  His story is inspiring, captivating, and courageous.  Hal is a rising star and along the way he will change thousands of lives.  I not only would recommend his books, but if you have the opportunity to hear him speak, do not pass it up!
B009AOFNU4|3.0|I honestly don't know why this thing costs so much; however, it is very well built and works like a charm. It is likely a bit smaller than you expect upon ordering one, but it doesn't take long to get use to its size. With that said, it's up to you to determine if it's worth the price.
B002RI9PS6|3.0|I enjoyed this book - it was very different with the story being held together by the history of tractors and yet the main themes included troubled family relationships; seeing an elderly parent as an individual, a sexual being and not just a parent and  reacting to his exploitation. it was a worthwhile read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I personly think it is very very fun I like it a lot you can run on trains and go on graffidy jetpacks how cool is that!!!!!
1401922732|5.0|I recently read some of Doreen Virtue's books on angels.  I enjoyed them very much.  Being that Ms. Virtue is also clinical psychologist, her writing seems to make some logic and sense to me.  It was not like reading fairy tales.  In any case, when I realised that she also has developed Archangel Michael Oracle cards, I immediately decided to purchase them.  For one thing, who does not need protection?  Archangel Michael offers them to all who seek it.  And then, when I received the cards, I followed the instructions on how to prepare them for the reading.<br /><br />I was delighed with the message(s) I got.  I was debating for some time if I should take (energy) healing classes.  I got the answer and I knew immediately what my next step was going to be. I do not know who to thank first: Doreen for making these cards available to the general public, or Archangel Michael for responding to my question so clearly and precisely.<br /><br />Finally, one does not have to be an expert to read the meaning of the card(s).  Set comes with booklet that provides instructions and explanations on how to use the set.  I am delighted I made this purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|no glitches and very fun and realistic. as if your in it you can train and play and the horseccan be changed. I totally recommend it

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a very good game, it did not take me a long time to understand controls, the Survival Mode is good, yeah it does not update on Kindle Fire, but they will fix that, I know , this does have multiplayer, and it let me upload it. I am a person, I am not fake, and I have a life out of this, but I could see the price going to around $5.00.

B000EGF0QY|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is a hilarious book. I've never read a funny novel before because I never thought humor could be as good in a book as in a movie. I won't say I liked all his essays. There were one or two i didn't care much for, but the rest were so much fun!<br />I will buy more of his books!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game about creativity. Minecraft has 2 game modes. first creative then survival. survival has nocturnal monsters. creative has unlimited blocks and all the blocks minecraft has.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|I have never been an avid Speed Racer fan, but it was one of the first animes I was exposed to.  I remember very little about it, so I can not vouch for its faithfulness to the anime itself.  However, I have watched more anime than most will watch in their life time, and I can honestly say that I have never seen a film capture the spirit of any anime so well before.  The cinematography, the acting, the visual style, everything creates the atmosphere that you are actually watching an anime and not a movie (which is probably the biggest reason this film didn't do as well as it should've financially).  I have to give the Wachowskie brothers kudos for this, as it is not an easy feat to achieve, especially to be able to do it well.<br /><br />  The plot revolves around Speed Racer (This is his real name), he comes from a family of racers.  His father, Pops, has his own racing company, and his brother raced for his father previously prior to a tragic accident.  As Speed grows up, he struggles with the same things that his brother previously struggled with, should he sign with a major sponsor which means better gear and a sure financial backing?  Or should he stick to his roots and continue to help support his father?  To tell you anymore would completely ruin any surprise in the film, so I will not divulge anymore.  The major themes in this family is supporting family vs. big business and supporting small businesses vs. big business.<br /><br />  The cast is perfect; Christina Ricci is adorable of Speed's girlfriend Trixie, Emile Hirsch is great as Speed, John Goodman is Pops, Susan Surrandon his mother, and Pauli Litt plays Speed's little brother Sprittle which could have been extremely annoying, but instead comes out as a typical child in any anime series.  I have to give the Wachowskie brothers props for being so faithful in spirit to the material, regardless of whether or not the story is faithful, the spirit of the project coincides with the spirit of the Speed Racer anime or any classic anime for that matter.<br /><br />  I could not ask for a better live action film version.  The visual style is stunning, and comes off a bit kiddish at first, but that was obviously intentional, and eventually finds a groove as it enters in the racing scenes.  The colors are splashy and bright, there are no dark colors and no earth tones (even the desert race scene is bright!), just brights and neons.  It is a shock to the eyes, but in a good way.<br /><br />  The blu ray transfer is crisp and clean, it is a truly beautiful film, and beautiful transfer.  It is too bad this wasn't made when the Real 3D got in to full swing, it would have made an amazing 3D film.<br /><br />  If you like fun movies, that are a little bit serious, but not too serious, than you will probably love Speed Racer. It is a great diversion and worth the time too watch.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyanime or any classic anime for that matter.<br /><br />  I could not ask for a better live action film version.

B00AB0AR2U|1.0|just all over the place, sad. did not understand it at all. what a waste of my time. just one movie to much
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved the book.  I couldn't put it down.  This book is very different from the other two books she's written(slammed & point of retreat).  This was a super intense book with some rather upsetting subject matter.  In the end I just didn't want to stop reading, I just had to know what was going to happen next.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a okay game definately would not have spent money for it so I was glad it was free. a good way to just pass the time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|allmost every time I use a save me with the diamond. the app shuts down. and I lost a lot of money like 5grand.  or more.  but don't let my review spoil your game. it is so worth it.  verry great game
B004GHNIRK|1.0|I didn't like it any better than when I had to read it in high school. I'm not into that type of reading.
B003BKZW7C|5.0|This was a terrific read, although I have read it many times before.  Stephen King's ability to write a great story never ceases to amaze me.  He can take up three pages just describing the character of a new person being introduced to the story. With any other writer this would be terrible over-kill, but Mr King has the ability to keep you mesmerized to each word.  Even though I am not a fan of the horror genre usually, the abilities of Mr King in writing so many amazing novels overrides that, and I read all of his works.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so great. It had love and suspense. I didn't want to put it down!! This is definitely at the top of my lost favorite books!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. Its a game where nothing is round. Even when I did'nt know anything about it I was excited.Survival is my favorite mode.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Oh my gosh! It's like a super great movie about singing! (Except it's full of racism, (hehe!) sexism, (those silly girls!) and otherwise lackluster special effects. Seriously. Not once did they use pyrotechnics. My high school choir did better.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|The clarity in tone quality is AMAZING!!!  I can hear ever instrument, every vocal and feel all of the energy generated while creating this album.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book has ruined contemporary literature for me. I just want you to know, this is preventable.<br /><br />I was pregnant, hormonal and the roads were icy. Taco Bell  and ice cream weren't viable options. So, OF COURSE I ordered the book everyone was talking about. I'm hip! I'm with it! Look, Barnes and Noble carries this, how bad can it be? I can get it for my ipad, read it in the bathtub and pretend I'm young and skinny again! Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />After about 5 pages in, I knew I had made a life- changing mistake.The author is like Anne from Accounting who always tries to chat you up in the breakroom. While she's actually 53, has a split-level ranch-style home with a garden in back and likes to watch Dr. Phil, she casually takes two names and puts them together. (Like you haven't heard, &#34;Brangelina&#34; for the millionth time.)<br /><br />After about an hour of reading, I realized I spent almost $10 on this. I knew I had to make a decision, do I admit my defeat, pack up the child I birthed 6 years earlier, apologize to my unborn fetus, (for what he may have heard inside my head*) and go for Taco Bell? NO. I am a woman of conviction. I'm going to finish this debacle. I can't drink, but my god... I can cry.<br /><br />Finish it, I did. And, I cried openly, (mostly out of shame that an &#34;author&#34; submitted this manuscript with as many errors and misconceptions about actual human beings as she did.) Sadly, this made me sob more powerfully. SOMEONE HAD EDITED THIS. Someone paid someone else ACTUAL MONEY to go through and MAKE THIS WORSE. This was when I basically gave up on literature, publishers and humanity. Regrets. I haz them.<br /><br />Here's the deal with this book: This book is like the time you got to make out with the football player and then you guys were going to get married and have golden-haired babies and he was going to work for METALLICA! And you were going to make fashions and sell them to JCPENNEY's and stuff. (It was the 90's.) What actually happened is, you threw up in his mouth when he tried to kiss you and then your mom had to pick you up from the movie theatre showing of, &#34;Titanic,&#34; and you refuse to watch that movie to this day. That about sums it up.<br /><br />For anyone who posted that this was &#34;Hot,&#34; or &#34;Steamy!&#34; or anyother play on any sort of word that means, &#34;GOOD,&#34; I fear for your soul.<br /><br />*I do not think my unborn fetus heard the horrible text in my head. But, the book was so bad if he did, it explains his colic and penchant for pooping his pants RIGHT BEFORE we are leaving the house. Thanks, E.L. James.at actually happened is, you threw up in his mouth when he tried to kiss you and then your mom had to pick you up from the movie theatre showing of, &#34;Titanic,&#34; and you refuse to watch that movie to this day.

B00395ZYVS|4.0|The characters were believable and well developed.  I found all the characters sympathetic.  Though it may have been a whole other story, I had hoped for a different resolution for Asha and Kavita by the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Two thumbs way up on this one. Everytime you thought you had the rest of the book figured out, BAM! The story takes a turn and you are drawn right back in to see what happens next. This is a book that really make you get attached to the characters and may even make some of you feel like you relate to them. Awesome book!
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|I didnt know about this movie until a could years ago, and i had watched pretty much all of eastwoods old westerns. THIS however may well be his masterpeice. When he walks in that Bar at the end of the movie, and take on that entire posse by himself. The hair stands up on the back of your neck, LITERALLY. You can see the shock on there faces when they realize what they'll awakened
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Laughed a lot! Fun story line! Can definitely tell its a Seth Macfarlane movie and would definitely recommend for a good laugh :)
B007PS0X0W|4.0|Not quite as good as 1 and 2 i didnt think but, just because kates so SUPER fine i'll still give it a 4 star
B000IDEORY|5.0|This movie is by far one of my all time favorite movies! Absolutely love it! And Patrick Swayze is always super delicious!! :)
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|The movie was phenominal in its day. But now looking back and watching it new, its interesting to see how nieve mankind really is in some of the things we assume in that movie.<br /><br />I also, have to say i do not like the fact that they see to demonize christianity at every chance in that movie
B009A9BEHU|5.0|By far one of my favorite current bands.  Each CD is unique in it's &#34;mood&#34;.  Chris Martin's voice is so calming.  Love to listen to on my iPod with the volume cranked up!
B001E75QH0|5.0|And Of course everyone knows these are excellent movies i just got them to have them on the shelf again
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!  I really enjoy playing I can't put it down! It keeps you wanting to beat your friends once you hook iyup tofacebook!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Probably one of the best books I've ever read. I'd recommend it to everyone. Great characters and great story line
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its great game and really addicting but the ads are annoying sometimes when I'm at main menu. Overall its a good game I guess
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great movie that built on and closed out a perfect TV series. Sure the series didn't get more than 1 season out of it but I leave the rationale of that up for others to ponder. I now have this on both BR and DVD. It just makes me feel all shiny inside!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Favorite book in this trilogy. Keeps you reading and not wanting to put it down until the book is over.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This TV series is one that was underestimated and should have gone much farther than it did. This said, I will say that I have completely enjoyed the BR & DVD's of the series that I own. I just wish they would have made more than one season of the show!!!!
B005DN5BE4|5.0|I had my daughter watch this movie with me for part of her American History.  At 13, she didn't quite appreciate this movie the way her dad and I do.  It is both touching and heartwrenching.  Truly brings the whole issue of slavery to a new perspective and depth - especially when you consider it is still going on in the world today even if it isn't in such a covert form.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I can't say this is any better than the other RE's.  I like action and this fit the bill.  There did seem to be some gaps in the story line from the other movies.  It could be that it was too long since I watched them to remember about her losing her powers, but she was still awesome.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I bought all three and couldn't put them down that is why it had to be 5 stars for me...I would recommend this book and the other two in the series to everyone.
1616550414|5.0|For only ~$20 this makes such a great gift for friends and family.  The pictures/pages are great quality and for a hardbound book, you can't beat the price.  Completely up to date (for now) and has definitely already come in hand as a &#34;wiki&#34; to settle disputes.  Love it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Subway suffers is similar to temple tun. It is a game I enjoy very much. So when I play this game I know I will have fun no matter what.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|When you tell about history in a way that you have never read before it is enlightening.  This is a story not just about a few people but a nation of people and there story as well. Wonderful and heart wrenching.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I extremely enjoy this game. I love horses but don't own one myself. This is the next best thing. The gems are sometimes a little difficult to get, but its okay because there's plenty of things you can buy with coins. HELPFUL: click on the little person in the top right hand corner to change your username and your horses name from beauty to whatever you want it to be.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the story. It kept my interest until the very end.  But I was disappointed in the ending. I would still recommend the book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great book! I'm.not a big reader and and trying to read more and this was a great start!! Loved it from beginning to end!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very fun because it's endless! there is no final level, you just keep going! I like when the updates bring new scenes, characters, and boards, so you can never have reasons to stop collecting coins! and it's free?? totally amazing!
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|This was not the book I MEANT to read, but it is the book I WANTED to read.<br /><br />Not that I was aware of that fact when I bought it. I believed this to be the book they just adapted into a film. Having no idea what that story was actually ABOUT, going only on a friend's recommendation that the book was good, I did a search for the title, saw that there were numerous options, and picked one, without reading the summary of either, based on some fleeting hunch or logic I can no longer remember despite it having happened less than 48 hours ago.<br /><br />48 hours? Alas... I would have finished it *sooner* had I not been otherwise engaged hauling several thousand pounds of seed at work during what is normally the slow end of my shift. Which is to say... nothing other than my boss or my spouse (...my other boss ;) ) could have convinced me to put this book down. If I'd had the option, I would have simply let the thing take control of my life for an entire night, from the first page to the last.<br /><br />It's THAT kind of book.<br /><br />And as for what I meant about this being the book I WANTED to read? More than being true simply as a turn of phrase suggesting that this was a story I wanted to be told but didn't realize that desire until it was fulfilled (which is true as well), there's a coincidental, more literal element: I'd just finished reading \\"The Terror\\" by Dan Simmons, which was a satisfactorily engaging novel that might be better described as a compilation of all known facts about the lost Franklin Expedition seeking the Northwest Passage in the mid-1800's with occasional dialogue thrown in oh and P.S. there's a monster or something. While I liked the book, I was a bit disappointed, since I'd gotten it hoping it would be more like \\"Hyperion,\\" another book by Simmons whose central monster was the first I've read about since I was 8 or 9 years old that LITERALLY gave me chills and actually scared me. Sadly, the titular Terror (which refers to the monster as well as one of the ships) appears only a handful of times in the near-1000 pages of story, never for long, and its explanation felt anticlimactic after so long being built up. However, that book seemed to find its strength in the last 5%, which focused on a surviving member of the expedition as he fell in love with an Inuit woman and became a member of her society and a sort of shaman, having had to set aside his lifelong devotion to his Christian God to do so.<br /><br />I wanted to read more about THAT. It seemed to me that the book had ended just as it was finally getting to the good part.<br /><br />\\"The Cloud Atlas\\" is that missing \\"good part.\\" Engaging, haunting, beautifully tragic, with characters who are magnificently-described and astonishingly alive, this book masterfully weaves together themes of propaganda, religion, and shamanic magic during a time of war in a place where survival is so much its own war there may be no way to tell the two apart... or to decide which one is real.<br /><br />An easy 5 stars, which is a rating I give out sparingly.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I was looking for a Mario type game for kindle fire and this is the one! Great levels and different powerups give it variety. Story isn't bad either. I highly recommend. Fun for kids and adults.
0399160450|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Threat Vector\\" by Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney.  This was one of the most enjoyable Tom Clancy novels I've read in a long time.  While I enjoyed the getting back to the characters I'd come to like when \\"Dead or Alive\\" and \\"Locked On\\" came out, I felt this continuing story from those two was even more suspenseful, action packed and well paced.  It started out with a bang and continued right to the very end.  The 835 page novel could have gone on like it did for another 800 pages and I wouldn't have minded.<br /><br />The story picks up not long after the events of \\"Locked On,\\" and all of the major players are back.  President Jack Ryan, Jack Ryan, Jr. and the rest of the campus regulars John Clark, Domingo Chavez, Sam Driscoll and Dominic Caruso are all accounted for.  Other familiar faces and of course new ones show up too.<br /><br />There are twists, turns and surprises, and a technological threat that almost makes one not want to be connected to the world wide web any longer.  I liked the mix of technology and old fashioned spy tactics and military action.<br /><br />Some have criticized Tom Clancy and his newer novels that have been co-written with others, but I found \\"Threat Vector\\" to be up to speed and as enjoyable as many of his earlier works.  Bottom line, it was a fun action tale.  After reading this one, I'm hoping it is not the last we see of these characters we have enjoyed reading about for several decades now.<br /><br />Review by Alain Burrese, author of \\"Lost Conscience: A Ben Baker Sniper Novel\\" and others.
B004VQK9XW|5.0|Awesome, Great CD for anyone whom grew up listening to Nikki with Crüe, Nikki and SixxAM have produced some great music.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|On Thanksgiving week-end, my ten-year-old nagged me to go see \\"Rise of the Guardians\\".  My response was \\"No way, I didn't like that first owl movie\\".  But he persisted and I so I grudgingly took him to a movie I had never heard of and which turned out to be not about animated owls at all.  Two hours later I left the theater thoroughly enchanted.  An animated \\"kids\\" movie had made me laugh, had me sitting at the edge of my seat, gaze in wonder and ultimately moved me to tears.  Since then I've taken my sons three times and counting - and we keep enjoying every minute of it.<br /><br />\\"Rise of the Guardians\\" is visually and creatively stunning.  The story of our childhood icons battling fear seems so simple, but it is told in a way that not only captures kids' imaginations, but also helps cynical adults get in touch with that inner child hiding somewhere inside.  This is not just a kid's movie.  This is a movie for all ages...  In our house it's already a classic.<br /><br />One of the best movies ever, should have been nominated for an Oscar.  The first movie I ever felt compelled to pre-order...<br />Go, Guardians.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers! It is the best app ever! Buy this app now, don't just stand there reading this review. Buy it!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Graphics was excellent and the story line was good. I became totally involved in the game. Got the game at a good price. Worth it. Cant wait for sequel.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Did they ever get out of the building? Don't waste your time on this movie. A poor attempt at a remake.
B004U52VPS|1.0|The reason I only gave this game one star is simple I purchased it for my 5 year old grandson. After going over the rules with him and playing with the game a few times he hardly gets the game out. He says he doesn't like it because he has to keep setting it up. I feel like I wasted my money when I could have purchased something more engaging for him.
0525953728|5.0|Such an amazing book. You'll get hooked on the first page, and as the story progresses you are not going to want to put the book down
B00B2V66VS|1.0|do not get it on kindle fire because when you turn to get the coins it wont work and there is way to many graphics.  do not get it
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Mother of God... It is a brilliant piece of work ever filmed! If you're a real batman fan since the comic book you'll know that there has been some changes, but it does not matter because you're so into these trilogies.  The director decided to make his modern path of these batman movies and i got to tell you it is phenomenal
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and I couldn't quit playing it because I couldn't wait to see what happened next!!!!!
B0036EH3XE|4.0|By this time Lost viewers and fans can pretty much be divided into two camps. There were those who liked the show and it's characters and there were those who mostly wanted to see how it ended so that they could hopefully have all of their questions answered. Nothing wrong with being in either camps but in the end Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof had to decide which group to satisfy. Needless to say they went with the former and the later have been feeling betrayed ever since. I for one enjoyed the entire series from beginning to end but I can certainly see how some fans might feel like they were ripped off. After all the topic continues to crop up on various websites and message boards to this day and it's been nearly three years since the finale was first broadcast. There was even a fella who penned an entire book length rant on the subject and published it on Kindle. All I can say is that it's high time to move onto something else and give up hating Lost.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Updated version works and looks better than before.  I have not run into a single issue. The look and feel is better than before.  And I have not been freezing up like with the older version.  News feed works great!
B00APUQH0W|5.0|What a great movie!!! No bad language, no nudity, really refreshing! Clint Eastwood knows how to produce, direct, and star! This movie hit it out of the park!!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Husband read it and we are getting along so much better. Love the fact we are able to feel more loved than before.
B009329ZF2|5.0|great adventure and safe for everyone to watch. I hope they enjoy it as much as my family did yahoo.
0316172324|5.0|Um livro que traz uma excelente hist&oacute;ria atr&aacute;s da outra sobre diferentes aspectos da vida humana. Se isso j&aacute; não bastasse, todas as hist&oacute;rias, narradas de uma forma brilhante pelo autor, servem para evidenciar sua tese de que n&oacute;s tomamos decisões num piscar de olhos iguais ou melhores do que as que tomar&iacute;amos depois de muito tempo para pensar.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|So glad they humanized and expanded the parts of Mrs. Hughes and Tom Branson!!! Someone in a store let out that they had killed off Sybil, so I was prepared for that ahead of time but I certainly did not expect the end of Matthew Crawley (when he was so deliriously happy).  That was so .....I don't know the word.<br /><br />Loved the whisper in O'Brien's ear about 'my lady's soap' (as only devoted followers of the series will know what that is about)!
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Wow, a great Disney movie that I never heard of until my kids found it.  We have already watched it twice in one week.  The kids loved it so much (8 year old boy and 5 year old girl) that they convinced me to watch it with them.  I'm not normally a fan of the genre but decided to humor them.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was, engaging, sweet, good plot, good animation, cute story, I have a feeling we'll be watching it again soon.
B0034JYC7G|1.0|Bad voice quality but still expensive. Bad bass effect. Same quality like any headphones you randomly buy from walmart for $5.
0547848412|4.0|This is a great book! I only read it since it was a book club selection.  The first 100 pages were slow to me but overall I found it to be an interesting read with great imagery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game!!!!!!! The kids love it and they can not get enough of it. Would not mind paying for it
B000002VSN|5.0|I love this soundtrack. I love \\"Joy\\", \\"I Believe in You and Me\\", and \\"Who Would Imagine\\". If your a Whitney Houston you have to own it. You will definitely hear her talented vocals singing these gospel songs.
B004GYY714|5.0|Great app,what ever you want to listen to it's there. So much variety it's crazy! I'd definitely recommend especially because it's free!!
030758836X|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first pages. It was an easy read and it will invoke many emotions. The author did a great job weaving the story together. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book. This book needs to be a movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me love your game so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers© is a super fun, challenging game that will keep you entertained the whole day! I give it a 5 out of 5!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is worthless..............joking!!!! This game is beast I love it it's so addictive and I lovelovelovelovelovelovelovelove it!!!!!!<br />Get it now or you'll miss out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Yeah it's great. I like it very well.  Can you tell? Play it for yourself.  Maybe it will be fun for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is perfect for my 5 year old. She loves it! It is a good game for her age group.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first,it sucked.Then I liked it because I saw how crappy the first one was.Iike it now because it is awesome
B007SGM084|5.0|Hated to put it down and didn't very often!  I enjoyed the series very very much and so did my husband, but he didn't read it, if you know what I mean!
B003TH14H4|5.0|I really like this show but my schedule does not allow me to catch up... I was hesitant to try the Video Library but did and I am in love with this idea and ability to watch at my pace. Better value than buying the DVD, plus I actually can watch when I want and as many times as I want. I look forward to purchase more videos through this service.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. First, I was Jake. Then,I was tricky. Know, I am lucy. I hope YOU LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS AS much as I did.<br />  Love,<br />  Gina

Please someone - someone please tell me where Holden learned all his moves especially that first kiss........OMG OMG OMG.  I cannot wait to finish this book.  It's like I am reading about a grown man and woman and not teenagers...........They have to make a movie from this book!!!<br />Just finished this wonderful book.  OMG OMG OMG. Will someone please recommend a therapist to Holder and SKy/Hope.  They are in dire need of a therapist who is on top of their game.  THIS BOOK IS SCREAMING SEQUEL!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, very addicting.  Gems are hard to come by tho.  Real life graphics.  Everything looks good.  Wish the gems were available easier but makes for a challenging game.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This movie is great but many people fail to see that the real subject is reincarnation. Phil is tied to one day simulating how we are tied to to the wheel of reincarnation by incarnating on this plane until we get it RIGHT! We reincarnate in many different bodies, ethnicities,  countries, and possibly worlds. We have to find the truth about ourselves and who and what we are. The movie \\"Arabian Nights\\" has this same teaching. The part where the Sultan makes a lowly drunk a Sultan and then trows him out to be a drunk again follows the reincarnation pattern. Sometimes we may incarnate rich and others poor. It is up to us to find the \\"truth\\" of our circumstances. We may keep in mind Buddha or the Christ when we ask \\"what is it we are supposed to find?\\"
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Downy Jr. before he was famous.  Unique and rather amazing.  It's ridiculously dirty and hilarious in a rather unique sort of way.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|At first, when I realized that it was a YA book, I almost set it aside. But by then, I was hooked. Ms Stiefvater is an excellent writer, weaving enough scenery to give your mind a stage and enough character development to give the characters form, but substance is layered on over the passage of pages. I love finding authors that I haven't read before. I'll mostly buy the next book, if I don't get distracted while looking for it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ein sehr gutes Spiel und die Maps sind sehr abwechslungsreich es lohnt sich sehr eine der aller besten apps ein musthave
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is better than the first one I would definitely say you need to play it play it and you will say the same
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play subway suffers all the time even when I am on the plane I love the game subway suffers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and addicting game. If you want to kill some time in an amusing way... this is how to do it!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've been looking for a lot of free games but this is the best one yet you don't have to buy the . App and it updates almost monthly
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome I love it if you need two expand your imaginasion do it it is worth it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg it is soo cool and awesome and I luv how u can upgrade it so its not boring like any other games I love it any way get this app please
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Are these guys actors????<br />Well done . a very strong insite as to be an Elite Soldier. Will definately recommend..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it's better than an other game I know. The creator(s) did the best game.subway surfers all day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is a lot of fun. They were in Nyc and that was awesome. Y u u u I
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game I recommend it for anyone who enjoys games of life or games where you take care of animals
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best mini series made in a long time, I can't wait for the next show to watch, I actually count down the days until it shows.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|It was great for people who game more than like 3 days a week but besides that there is other things to buy with the money you spend on this.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love it. it works ok I have had to uninstall and reinstall after only two runs. I was very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much! Seriously like one of the most addicting games EVER!I will never stop playing it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|OKAY first off its great second off its awesome third off its fantastic fourth off omg IT IS AWESOME OMG AWESOME
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This site is so easy to use. It helps keep me in touch with friends and family at any time of the day.
B003A9584Q|5.0|This is a really good live album and it has a lot of their good tracks. I am happy I got this at the sale price what a deal.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Goes well beyond the standard After Death Experience. Linking solid science and medicine with a. Beautiful description of &#34;heaven.&#34; A great read.
B000002PH1|5.0|Fantastic album!  Great travelling music for long car trips, vacations and more.  Can't resist singing along, even if Belinda needs no help from me! :-)
B0091Q82L8|5.0|There is a lot more here than on the original Live at Leeds.  I guess if you have the deluxe L@L CD set this may be redundant.  As my only copy of L&L is the original vinyl version, this one is quite a bit more comprehensive.  One CD is Tommy live and the other is similar to L@L, but expanded from 6 tracks to 12.  I would prefer a vinyl version, but this is an excellent set and CD and MP3 are the only options.  If you are a Who fan don't hesitate, you surely won't be disappointed!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome series can't wait for part 3. Really tells a story. Gideon and Eva were made for each other. Lots of Omg and awww moments. Be prepared to gasp a few times. Not as hot and wet as bared to you but still awesome
B007BFSYMS|5.0|my husband and i slept with an industrial fan running year round just because the noise helps us sleep.  This app means that i no longer have to freeze to death every night because the fan is on!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Like! For this as it lets me take quality pictures better than with the default one. I am an artist and publish my own work, so with this and the free photo editor is enough for me. I also share a lot, a great $1.99 to treat yourself, as  photos aren't awkward any longer.<br /><br />Nice developer response came out with a free camera app now, as well. Love the scene, and still recommend!<br />PPS Make art and music! Spotify premium for the win!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the best grisham book I've read and I have read all his work.  The author did a great job maintaining my interest.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed it, but several puzzles required going to the walkthrough. That, and zero relay value, keeps it from a higher rating.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This is not the Larousse Gastronomique (which I also own). Instead, it's a collection of different techniques and tips, from choosing a Chef's knife to survival skills and from simple soup to &#34;molecular&#34; cooking. It's not all good, but the book is cheap, it is a very pleasant read and would probably be amusing even for people who don't want to cook. That's why it feels like visiting the flea market: a lot of content is worthless, there is some very good stuff if you look around but anyway the whole experience is fun.<br /><br />On another level, Tim Ferriss has the soul of a scientist. I say this as a researcher myself because I see that he enjoys putting theory to the test and he has a constant flux of ideas. Many people will tell you that you need to boil an egg 7 min, but he actually boils several and takes photos. He even cuts steak after different resting times to show why resting is good. Many readers don't care for that level of detail, but I find it refreshing. Even the short excursions into biochemistry and molecular biology, for example discussing the GLUT4 receptors in the context of avoiding weight gain, are welcome additions to the text for the curious.<br /><br />Finally, I would caution readers to take health-related advice in the book with a grain of salt. Not that it's plain wrong, but rather it's not yet, in my eyes, sufficiently backed by evidence. It is material open to research but not (again, in my eyes) proven for everyday practice.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I think this app is actually pretty cool. I think it should be a little cheaper, but it is still a good clock. It doesn't wake me up, but mostly because I listen to music every night, and let it play all night, so my body can't tell when it goes off. But other than that it's a pretty decent app.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great app and i would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and survival or who loves to create structures. I can't waiy for 0.6.0 to come out on the Kindle Fire. Im only giving four stars because it occasionally crashes or slows down at times but it is tolerable
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Had played angry birds on a friends tablet, it is entertaining.  Will most likely purchase Star Wars and other Angry Bird games.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The gold stars are of course the higher currency but you can get along the game just fine without them it is a time consuming game but it IS fun.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|LIKE THE ADDED DISK WITH EXTRAS ON HOW THE MOVIE WAS MADE, ADDS TO THE ADVENTURE. OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO GET THEM ALL.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is much like the first but as much different to its fun an addicting I recommend getting this game plus its free
B002BWP49C|4.0|A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AFTER I PURCHASED IT THEN SET WITH BOTH PART ONE AND TWO CAME OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. BUT LOVE THE MOVIE.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I had to remove it since was a virus on my fire.  You might want to check the app to remove that virus from this app.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Nice easy read with a good story line.  Makes me want to go right out and get book two, the son of Neptune.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|ok so one minute I have 6,000 coins and then the next they are all gone!!! would anyone like to tell me what is happining because I don't like it
B0076DELIG|4.0|Excellent. Classic Harry Bosch. Hope he never retires. Keeps you guessing. A good who done it. Enjoyed seeing Harry get a break.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Omg I love this app. its just like its a real horse!!:) and I need more wordsssssss overall a great app.,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I rate subway surfers for five out of five stars!! It was amazing!! I loved it!! I couldn't possibly live with out it!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show has you on the edge of your chair....every episode! I can't wait to see what happens next....just riveting !
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great to have all my stuff accessible on my Kindle Fire.  But a little bit clunky compared to the standard version.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is the first novel by  Gillian Flynn that I have read, and i was so engrossed i couldnt put it down.The plot twists and turns and builds up to a finale that I didn't expect.  It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat, I just wish it had been a bit longer! I would definitely recommend this novel, so much so, that I will be purchasing  the next one by this author.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Such are the questions this thoughtful book provokes. The science, food, and myth - all bound up the personal relationships, parents, friends - so different yet the same, teachers, books. A full life to admire, learn from then run on.
0760703329|5.0|This is a beautiful volume of the classics.  I thought I had read everything Shakespeare wrote, but I found some new pieces in this volume.
B001KEHAI0|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, and not the film itself.  I was pleased with the quality of this edition of Groundhog Day.  Although this is not the type of film where hi-def makes that much difference, it nevertheless provided an enhanced viewing experience for someone who has seen this movie many times (my family typically watches it every year around Groundhog Day).  It provided a fresh look at the film.  If this is one of your favorite films, and you are considering an upgrade from DVD, I think it is worth it.  Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Do you like Subway Surfers hit me up on Twitter or Facebook Daunsha like and rate.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00194WY3C Alvin and the Chipmunks: \\"How We Roll\\" Music Video]]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this all the time.I love it!  It comes in handy with the kids homework as well. You will love it too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is the best beacaue there's a lot to do and I like animals and this game if you have a houres or want a houres it wold help you understand what it would be like
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This system came with the v2 motherboard and latest BIOS, and installing Win7 Pro 64-bit, then drivers from included disc was pretty easy.<br /><br />I upgraded to the Shuttle PC63J 500 watt power supply and added a GTX 650 ti graphics card.  Not necessarily a top-shelf gaming system, but I'm pretty satisfied with the performance on 1920x1080.<br /><br />i5-2500k<br />Corsair XMS3 4x4gb RAM<br />Crucial m4 64gb SSD<br />WD Caviar Black 1tb HDD<br />Samsung DVDRW<br /><br />The GTX 650 ti runs ridiculously cool, even at load, compared to other GPUs.  That, along with its relative shorter length make it a great fit for this compact system.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My kids loved it I however did not get to watch it, so my review is based off their opinion
0143112724|4.0|The cover was bent but I had to use it anyway as it was a gift, a slight bit embarrassing!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game loved the first one. Soon as I got this game I played for a decent hour or so and put it down, but when I came back to play some more my Kindle won't open it all the way. I hope I simply have to restart my Kindle but otherwise the game was amazing!
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is an ideal cover for a particular type of user. First it is a hard poly carbonate shell that has been `fused' to the rubber sleeve. This rubber bit bends in the middle for a landscape viewing of the Kindle, but only in one angle of about 45 degrees, which is ok for the train and desk etc. It also has an elasticiated handle which aids when reading or using in portrait mode.<br /><br />It is very light but if you were to drop the Kindle Fire then would not afford too much extra protection, but that would be your own fault. The standing for hands free reading mode is also not all that. All it does is stand up without being able to tilt so you have to have it at eye level or very near to it, so not really all that fab to be honest. It also could not be accused of being undersold and there are some much more inexpensive ones out there.<br /><br />All that said if you want a minimum fuss, lightweight cover that allows hands free access for movies and the like for commuting or related activity then this is probably a good choice. The handle is very good and very well attached too and despite the lightness this has the feel of quality.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|the first jack reacher that was hugely disappointing.there were long boring periods spent in a car with three dull colourless characters.the plot stumbled along and was more of a geography lesson than anything else.finally the author deemed it was time to bring things to an end ( maybe he was also bored) . the final climax was way over the top even for reacher and the explanation given for the bad guys existence was just silly - almost an afterthought to end the book.<br />very sad to see an excellent series stoop so low
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It's a great game and I really like it! I would recommend it to anyone who likes temple run, because they are very alike.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Downloaded this app on my kindle fire. Each time I try to launch using Facebook Connect it gives me an error &amp; forces close.
0446580848|1.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers who said, \\"enough is enough.\\" The wisecracking, sarcastic attitude of John Corey was so annoying that I was hoping the Panther would slit his throat just to shut him up. I,too,am a Nelson DeMIlle fan but if he stays with John Corey I will never read him again. It's so sad when some of these successful authors just crank books out. This book is below mediocre.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Got hooked on this by watching random episode that were available and fell in love with the story =D<br />recommend it, you won't be disappointed if you like this kind of genre
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Im not into techno or house music but this cd simply blows me away each time i listen to it!  I have never heard a producer encorporate so many different styles.  He is literally genre less.  MR moore u sir deserve all the credit u get
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Third season really took off from the first two seasons.  Wish there were more than 13 episodes.<br />Film quality TV show.
B003L77FYS|5.0|i love this series. writing and acting are superb. fillion and katic hilarious and hot. supporting cast is also excellent.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Looking forward to fifth season.  This will keep you guessing to the end.  The acting was superb.  The<br />bad guys seem realistic.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|even better than season 1, actually. i like the bonus features but would like to see more of the hilarious outtakes
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|cuteness overloaded has came!!!! best game ever i hate that you have to have facebook account. also takes so long to load on my kindle fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Then graphics were great and the characters were good fit not speed of the game. My cousin tried to play but only got ate by the monster.(Before she spent all 509 gems.)
B00571F26Y|5.0|All I can say is read this book and then share it with friends and family. I thought this book would be gimmicky-- another diet fad. Not in the least! Davis explains the perils of wheat consumption in great detail, spanning every question the reader may have along the way. I would learn something, then form a question only to have it answered soon after; as if this book were a conversation between patient and doctor. LOVED IT! Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A good game I can play forever I strongly recommend this game for any browser.you can do a lot on it like buy characters or boards good work kiloo
B005IQZB14|3.0|I expected more of this book-- not that it wasn't good-- it was. I love her complete honesty. She just brought so much trouble upon herself. There were times I wanted to scream at her for putting herself in such precarious situations with men. I had to remind myself that this novel is a coming of age story and some of us have to find danger before we can appreciate the value of caution. I love that she tackled something so huge on her own!! She just could have been so much more thoughtful and careful regarding her own safety and well-being. She was very lucky in the face of so many near disasters.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If i could give more than 5 stars i would for this product! It brings All three movies plus the special edition blu-ray disk as well for each movie, plus it includes ULTRA VIOLET where you can instantly stream and download your movies on any computer. A total of 5 Blu-ray disk and also the 64-page Art of the Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy, for a price like this, was surely a easy steal.
0817439390|5.0|Book is great with beautiful photos. And arrived very promptly Thank you.  Lots of good information. Can't wait to delve into it in depth and gain lots of knowledge.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|One of those books where you know you are going to miss the characters for quite some time. . . . Stephen King rarely disappoints.
1608871045|5.0|This is a really neat book lots of cools photos and art work to go along with it. Highly recommend for any nolan/batman fan.
B002PMPTIO|3.0|The movie is obviously five stars; the quality of picture and sound in the streaming version left a lot to be desired.  The connection seems strong enough not to lose the movie part way through; therefore, it should also buffer to a higher quality picture faster than it does.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a health care professional (although retired), I have cared for, and grieved with families, and loved so many in such grievous states as Dr. Alexander. And I have watched and listened to others of our profession, as they seemingly unemotionally told families that their loved one was brain dead and should be taken off life support.  To read this book, written by a physician in such straits, and to read the heartwarming, inspirational story of his journey beyond the gates of life was..........well, I'm lost for words to describe the experience.  It was indescribable.<br /><br />If you want to read a book that will bring you hope, and love, and life...this is it. Read it and see.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|One of the better find object games I've played recently. Great graphics, and an excellent storyline. Not so difficult it gets frustrating, just hard enough to keep you thinking.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a cute little game and the horse's movement are real looking.  It would be a great game for a young child
B000FC10IO|5.0|The trilogy was an amazing read. It was very hard to set it down. I could easily read it again.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|So this is what a couple hundred million dollars can buy you in special effects these days.  I generously rate this collage a 3 for the beautiful imagery and moody score.<br /><br />Only die-hard Alien fans, who have longed for an origin story, need apply. Scott barely tickles their fancy with a feather.<br /><br />For the rest of us, Prometheus is a mish-mosh of a missed opportunity.<br /><br />I don't mean the trivialization of human existence to being a botched experiment by the &#34;engineers&#34;. Or their witty idea of eliminating said experiment by creating a bio-weapon, that backfires on them.<br /><br />I'm referring to the major whiff by Mr. Scott. The bonafide sci-fi Pinocchio story that was lost in this over-cooked soup. The android was birthed before our eyes, and snatched away, with a dreaded tease of resurrection by sequel.<br /><br />Hopefully that sequel will represent a rich attention to character, and set design.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Amazing cast.  Beautifully framed and filmed, like all of Andersen's films.  Have seen it twice and will probably watch again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and the challenges...great game to play to pass time. I have my entire household addicted to this game.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|It didn't really conclude the story very well, or answer anything at all.  It was worth watching for the few times I did jump, but I'd suggest waiting for this to be on netflix or free on tv/cable, I wouldn't suggest paying for it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game<br />Like it to clean the horse and make training. Finde diese Atmosphäre und die Umgebung sehr schön.  Mann kan sich sehr gut in die Rolle des halters.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie, really funny for kids and I definitely recommend this movie in Blue-Ray. This is a must have for all.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|What is with all of the helpless female main characters lately?  What does it teach young girls?  The boyfriend is just plain creepy.  Terrible book!
B000FC1QQU|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  I love the way the African culture permeates the story.  I really enjoyed some audio books by this author as they were read by an African woman.  It was a very pleasant listen -- prompted me to check out other audio books in the series.  I love the way the love of country comes thru & the values of Mma Ramotswe are revealed in her speech.  I may be a little bit African deep inside.  I love the folks in this book.
1468179993|5.0|The author did an excellent job analyzing some of the best TED Talks and picking apart what makes them so good. Things like having a memorable \\"catchphrase\\" and setting up the MC for a relevant introduction are interesting subtleties which can make your talk more impactful. Many of the lessons in this book on having a strong opening and delivery could be found in other guides on public speaking, but this book is much more engaging because it references some very interesting lectures that you can view and learn from on the TED website.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a great story, I'd love to see a sequal!  I love the connection and surprises this book offers... Not too steamy but great all the same!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was a good precursor to viewing the movie.. well written story.  It was fun to read with my wifre!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like cards game and this is a must for the Kindle Fire in my book. I have played it quite a while after getting the app.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Proof of Heaven is an interesting account of a near death experience by an MD ....makes hopeful reading about our after-life..
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put these books down!!! I was in awe. The first book caught me off guard, but I kept reading and oh my!  I read all three in one weekend.  They were the best books I've read in a long time!!!!! Loved, loved, loved them!
B007SUW24W|5.0|Enjoyed every track on this record.  Vocals, music,lyrics and instrumentals all terrific. I reccomend anyone looking for something fresh to purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game to play you can use jetpacks and hoverbourds and u can ride trains it is an awesome game
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|May the force be with you if you get this. You will be stuck for days battling it out with the Empire.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun and,in my opinion,is better than temple run.Overall a great game.love the the characters and likes the Rio update.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Romance isn't my usual, however book was well written and had an edge of suspense. Ended abruptly, but then you can imagine the rest.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is very interesting! Most of my school friends love this game! My parents also love this because it teaches children skill, eye and hand skill as well..
B00992CF6W|4.0|All of my friends have the new 0.6.0 update on their Apple devices BUT THE STUPID KINDLE DOESN'T HAVE IT. Please fix this. I only rated four stars because there is no update. Otherwise you should totally get this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have Minecraft on the kindle,my ipod, and xbox.Personally xbox version is better,but this version is awesome 2.I think this app should be 5 stars.
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|1. The movie Expendables, was lame.<br /><br />2. The Copryright holders of this movie, went on a suing spree, they extorted/blackmailed $3,000-4,000 from ~20,000+ \\"illegal pirates.\\"<br /><br />3. You can verify #2 with a simple google search..something like.. \\"expendables lawsuits torrents.\\"<br /><br />4. Innocent people get sued constantly, much easier to do than 1 would think.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Imagery  had me right there on the trail  with Cheryl. some parts of the book were a little slow and I found myself skipping ahead. Overall Cheryl had me rooting for her the whole way!
B005NJU8PA|1.0|Sorry, this book wasn't for me - couldn't even fishish reading it. I would suggest you go to a book store and thumb through before you buy, if you are still interested go ahead and buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a great time killer and also a competitive game with the option of connecting to face book there you can post your high score and compete to see who has the better score. The world tour is also another good thing about this game. So if you don't have this app you have got to get it
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy playing.  The game seems to never end. It keeps me busy for hours.  Would really like to do more without the diamonds though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun app for anyone of age. You can jump dodge and buy characters. It is just like temple run.
B009G78EE2|4.0|I enjoy his flow and the beats are awesome. Would buy his next one. Would love to see him live.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a very good game I've been playing on pc and Xbox I love it. It runs just like pc my only complaint is that it needs to be updated and it would be cool if you could make your own skins.
B0032Z93J4|3.0|Screenwriter David Loughery and director Steve Shill would have us believe that \\"Obsessed\\" is some absorbing psychodrama. It's actually a Psycho-Comedy, with Ali Larter as Psycho Lisa; the \\"office temp\\" from Hell at the center of it all. It's all been there, done it before as \\"Fatal Attraction\\"; with Larter less intense than Glenn Close, but equally demented and deranged. In retrospect, \\"Fatal Attraction\\" is a misogynistic, retrogressive piece of junk-- with smug, cocky Michael Douglas allowed to have his extra-marital affair and get away with it! \\"Obsessed\\" is obviously the same piece of junk; but it is a much more fun, \\"popcorn movie\\" piece of junk.<br />  Derek's (Idris Elba) marriage to Sharon (Beyonce Knowles) is so stable and hot-- they make love on the bedroom carpet of their beautiful new house-- he, unlike Michael Douglas in \\"Fatal Attraction\\", won't even THINK about having an affair.<br />And twisted Lisa tries so hard to seduce him (in the Men's Room, parking garage, etc.). Elba is such a dull actor, he's not the type anybody would flip their lid for.  Now, L.L. Cool Jay would have been perfect casting--AND PERFECT eye candy in the role. Jerry O'Connell co-stars as Elba's office pal with a very liberal attitude towards office \\"hanky-panky\\", and Christine Lahti is an investigator who needs a few more brains in her head.<br /> Don't worry, though, Beyonce is not going to play the \\"victimized wife\\" to any degree. Beyonce brings her \\"Diva Attitude\\" to the \\"wife\\" role-- and thank God! Things don't get interesting until Larter attempts suicide; and Beyonce tells dull Elba to get the hell out of her house! The fun part is just about to begin; because the movie is just an excuse for a \\"girl fight\\" between Beyonce and Larter. Beyonce and the fight do not disappoint! Beyonce does a GREAT job of whipping Larter around like she is a rag doll (\\"I'm gonna whip the floor with your white ass!\\"). Beyonce's triumphant song over the end credits, the ironically/hilariously titled \\"Smash Into You\\", did however leave me in fits of uncontrollable laughter.itled \\"Smash Into You\\", did however leave me in fits of uncontrollable laughter.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good and fun game! Appropriate for all ages! Love the world tour! Overall this game is very fun and exciting!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really like the acting and feel that the movie is beautifully made.  Commenting from the perspective of visual effects, I  especially like the scenes in which it appears that worlds are being created in a beautiful, elegant web.  I found the plot to be too uneventful and even predictable at times, however, and I would give the movie only 2 stars because of the plot were it not for the acting, which I felt was very, very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|In my opinion is that it was a really fun game to play also its hard because I can't go to the bonus mystery box
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw my kids playing this game. One of them downloaded it to my Kindle Fire. One day I was bored saw it started to play this game had me hooked from day one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. I recommend this game for all ages. You have to get this game. You will be happy you did
B000W93CHC|4.0|I enjoyed trilogy II but not as much as trilogy I. Great characters but the book seemed to lag at the end.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Awesome game it is really fun and exciting I love this game  can't wait to play it again it's better than most
B0076DELIG|4.0|Classic Connelly. I love Harry and his daughter. Not Michael Connelly's best story but a good one just the same.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was so sad, and made me cry! Don't get me wrong it was amazing!, but I wouldn't recommend this to someone who doesnt like contemporarys. Great book, highly recommend, and would go see this if it was made into a movie opening day. Jay Asher makes you feel what it's like to love a girl and have her commit suicide. You felt everything the characters felt, and I finished the book in a day, I just couldn't put it down.
0061673730|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from a friend. I was always turned off by fiction or a mix of non-fiction and fiction type books because of a false belief I held that I wouldn't learn anything of value from them. Well this book has shattered that belief for me and has opened my mind. I have learned to understand things about people that I could never put my finger on before. If you like read enlightening stories about the underlying psychological ways human thinking than this book is a great start!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I wasn't going to read this book series and it is not what I normally like to read. How ever I won a copy of the movie for book 1 so I told myself I would make myself read book 1 and nothing more. HA I could not put it down. I loved it. One of my all time fav book series now. I am reading more books by this wonderful author :)<br /><br />5 stars all the way a million stars if I could.
B0078Q2HAA|2.0|I never cease to be amazed at the manner in which Meryl Streep transforms herself into a totally different human being.  In this  case she &#34;becomes&#34; the famed Prime Minister in manner and speech.  It's a performance worth time and investment.  Unfortunately the film lacks coherence.  The story line is confused and the continual &#34;visions&#34; of her dead husband become tedious. The script seems incomplete and the editing is absolutely dreadful.  What evolves is a character study of Ms. Thatcher rather than her life's story.  Watch this only if you want to see another great performance by America's greatest actress.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I downloaded this game and when it was installing it stiled and downloaded the whole thing again but os still fun
0316228532|1.0|I absolutely loved the Harry Potter series and have read them several times. This book is awful. It is boring, depressing, not a happy book. I read quite a bit of it and then skipped thru' trying to find something to like. Even the last couple of chapters were not worth the read.  I was so so so disappointed. I probably  won't read another one of her books. I feel so sad that this was such a disappointment.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|It was a great movie...for adults. The streaming kept messing up...I know it wasnt my computer because I played SOA to make sure. That was the only issue I had. We finally got to see the whole thing last night .
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|Don't understand the slammers. This thing lopes along smack dab in the pocket. Great groove. Fat 'n' juicy bass line. Big ole hook! Clever lyrics. And Mr. Nelson's voice is in top form, squeals and all. This is a nearly perfect \\"hit\\" song. If this doesn't make you want to move your a$$ I don't know what will.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is fun and addictive, which is not always a good thing. I am on the world tour now and am excited to go to different places.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Bought this for the kids to help teach them a bit about building structures and and gravity. Plus sling shotting little birds at what they build gives them a good laugh.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is amazing and i love defenetly recomend it to anyone but i sjouldnlet you knownif you have a kindle the updates can take longer to get than an i pad
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Glad I was still alive to get this Edition. Been waiting 50 years. Greatest motion picture of all time! Wow!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing story.  Touching and such a great author.  So excited for it to become a movie! Hazel's character is captivating and strong.
0061997811|5.0|I have been a long time Harry Potter fan. And this book makes a great edition to any collection. Now, this is a big and heavy book. But it is filled with all kinds of information, pictures, and stories. If you love behind the scenes stuff, then this book is for you!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of da best games I played so far n I love how dey always changing da theme so u wont get bored like with some games!!!!!
1608870081|5.0|I am a long time Harry Potter fan. This book is a fun edition to any collection. The pages are quite beautiful, and well thought out. Well worth the money!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Enjoyed all three books. Would recommend all for older children and adults. Wished story went a bit further. Collins is a great writer.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I have always loved this movie, every since I was a little girl. Which is funny since I hate cats, but I really love this movie! Cute story line, love the music, when Disney was good!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Go to the very bottom for just the product review<br /><br />I have used many brands of mice including 2 microsoft intelli, 2 razor gaming mice, and about 4 logitech mx/g mice.<br /><br />Microsoft iintelli is known for plain, yet very durable mice. Ergos are just ok, and materials are abit tacky but still work very well these last years and years<br /><br />Razer mice are very flashy mice. ergos are very specific to how you hold mice, palm/clow. Terrible costumer service and broken mice are common. lost me as a customer after i paid $60 on a mouse that broke in 3 months, could not reach them for RMA warranty services no matter how many times I contacted them.<br /><br />Logitech is the leader of the industry with a wide array of award winning mice. Been a loyal costumer until my brother and I were experiencing issues with the latest g400 mice. they wear out real fast and have terrible cords that short. the Mx518 and g5 of yesteryear were much better quality, but still have some issues.<br /><br />after going through 2 g400 mice in less than a year I decided to give this brand a shot because of the glowing reviews<br /><br />The fit and finish of this mouse puts many $60+ to shame. the flat scroll wheel is FLAT! and it works brilliantly. The ergos for this mouse is best with palm grip. Center of the mouse has a matte rubberized coating with is smooth and silky feeling. thumb rest is a nice grippy rubber. Blue lights are pleasant and not intrusive.  The mouse has 3 thumb buttoms which is in an arc formation so misclicking  is not a problem. Who ever engineered the mouse really thought about form and function. Its great to see that they arent just copying other companies and sell something inferior that looks similar to the big brand names.<br /><br />Pros<br />has a mouse wire damper, reinforced woven wire covering (huge problem with logitech mice)<br />Customizable light (just the anker part)<br />Great feel for palm grippers<br />Weighted well, used all the weights<br />Ultra slick mouse feet<br />Laser tracking!<br /><br />Cons<br />Wish the 3 side buttons were ruberized black or dark grey, or semi translucent white, the silver colored paint seem to lack continuity. not a huge issue since looks are subjective. otherwise a very good looking mouse in my opinion<br /><br />used for FPS and MOBA games
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I love anything Sherlock Holmes! And I love this movie!! Robert Downey Jr. does a great job acting in this, funny and witty, and everything else you would expect!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|all must like temple run but them change every month and have trains.I love this game so much.My nephew call his self playing talking about he going 2 beat my high score and in temple run.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It is a good game to pass the time, it is challenging enough so you don't get bored with it and easy enough so you don't get annoyed with it!
B005C0DHEY|1.0|I am a nature lover and consider myself to be a protector of our environment. I have many concerns about our environment, especially our land and water.  My business is built upon leading a healthier life and protecting our environment.<br /><br />However, I am tired of these so called environmentalist with their flat out lies.  We have real environmental problems, yet people like Al Gore and Josh Fox can barely open their mouths without lies pouring out.  It saddens me that so many Americans believe anything that is in the newspaper, on TV, etc.  The media would lead you to believe the USA is pure evil.  United States has some of the strongest environmental laws in the world and yet people like Josh Fox would rather make the US energy dependent on other nations that have almost no regulations.  For these people it is all about money, fame and power - NOT the truth!!!<br /><br />If you are concerned about the environment but uncertain of the truth I would encourage you the watch or read \\"Cool it - The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide To Global Warming\\" by Bjorn Lomborg.  I do not agree with Bjorn on many of his opinion.  But he is not trying to manipulate the facts, he is attempting to present the facts in an unbiased manner.<br /><br />Fracking is a real environmental concern that we need to take serious and look at the pros and cons, solutions and even compromises. But when documentaries like this are filled with lies it only hurts the discussion. We should be open minded to the potential of safer alternative energy.<br /><br />I don't believe we should give big oil the freedom to do whatever they want. We should move forward with caution and concern for the real environmental issues, not make up fabrications that are nothing but bad propaganda. The real safety and environmental issues can only be won when people know the real issues, rather than surrounding the real issues with a bunch of half-truths and lies.<br /><br />The sensationalizing of these serious issues only divide American citizens from being able to have productive discussions. And the people who are profiting off the sensationalism and lies are not being held accountable.  We need to educate ourselves and start holding big government, big business and big media accountable.<br /><br />I love documentaries by small independents that try to give an unbiased perspective, but this is definitely not one of them.  It is time for us (WE THE PEOPLE) to stop playing party politics and start communicating about realistic solutions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really great. It is soooooo much better than the original version.....really great app! I loved all the cool graphics along with the different patches and the rope. GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is my favorite weather app ever! Very user friendly and accurate.<br />Would recommend to everyone in a heartbeat for all weather related info.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game Is Really Really Fun !! I Reccommend it To All Ages !!! Every One Should Play This Game I Love It !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun. me and my cousin and my best friend Hayley's like this game so much we love playing o. the kindle with this game
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Everyone else who reviewed this said that they didn't really care for it, due to a few problems. However, those problems didn't really occur to me while using this app. So, the only thing that I found wrong with this is that the news feed shows things in a random time order, even when you check off the area that says &quot;Most recent first&quot;. That is why this app is getting only 4 stars, otherwise it would be a strong 5.
B00AXA5BXS|1.0|This case is a fake! it comes in a life proof case and all but is a complete knock off and the company does false advertising! for one its pink and black, it says it was pink and grey, also, the whole thing is cheap plastic!, on the real lifeproof, the grey rim is rubber and the case is a lot thicker and a lot more protectant. all there is to say really is its a FAKE! not a real lifeproof by NO means at all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is by far the best game in the world but the new update hasn't came I really want it plz
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Good awesome book love it very very badly I would recommend this book to you in love! XD cool g
B00992CF6W|1.0|The game is tarable only because it won't update to version 6.0 if it would I would have  gave it a better review
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I found myself relating to a number of examples in the book.  From my cravings for a certain type of food, to the difficulties of relating to a person who's had a severe stroke.  The method for how to re-engineer your habits is straightforward, but not so simple to implement.  I enjoyed the book.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|My only regret is that they didn't make this movie right after they found him, 15 years ago.  We'd never heard of Rodriguez till we read Roger Ebert's review.  The one advantage of the time gap is that the film shows that fame doesn't seem to have gone to his head (he's been performing regularly in those 15 years, and presumably making money - which he seems to give away).  Mr Rodriguez, thank you for this wonderful music.  May you live long, and prosper, and may your life be filled with joy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is brilliant and I love playing the different maps and I hope there are more of them to come
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|I loved part one but part two is even better, I didn't think it would even be possible but this film pulled it off. I've read the source material several times and always wished I could see the biggest fight of all played out on the screen. This film doesn't disappoint in the slightest, Peter Weller once again nails it as batman. The comic book was written in the 80s and this shows in key scenes, Reagan is president and the soviets are still around terrorizing the rest of the world, so keep that in mind as you watch this. The dark knight returns is the comic book that's responsible for the batman we have today, it brings a gritty and angry batman to the forefront. The fight is actually better than I always imagined it would be, and as far as I'm concerned the question of who would win was answered with this movie. I've watched both parts multiple times now and it never stops being cool, definitely worth checking out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You should  make Africa with green trains and a thing In the mystery box double coins or you can buy it for 4000 coins
B009GEON22|5.0|I'm always wary of movies like this because they always seem to be missing something. But this is the animated movie I've been waiting for. I read dark knight returns several times growing up and was really excited when I heard about this. It's gritty and rough with a great soundtrack and is exactly what a batman fan would love. Peter Weller was the perfect choice for the main role. This is a break from the animated comic book movies we're used to seeing, we need more animated movies like dark knight returns!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Like this book Had to have to complete the series. Would reccommend these three book series to others. Amazon service is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved subway surfed from the beginning and it is almost guarenteed you will too. I love it so much that even my brother wants me to play his for more money.
B00B935SUY|5.0|The film is really good. It was similar in illumination as a documentary as the Tom Dowd documentary. This follows a classic Neve mixer rather than an individual, and is like seeing backstage of many of the Classic Albums DVDs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its very relaxing and very easy to play.keep it up. more updates please after the newest version  good work.nice job
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|Fun addiction but has bugs were blocks progress and you have to wait to play lottery wish they would debug and speed up progress
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Ok, so if you are frustrated with the ending on book one.....you HAVE to read number two.  Christian and Ana continue to evolve and I enjoyed getting to learn more about them.  Keep reading, it only gets better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its differnet. but by a little.  it has new things but a ton.  new land scape... ok.  one gaiant monkey...cool looking.<br />lol JK ITS EPIC!!!!!  FINLY ITS HERE!!!!  IV BED WAITING FOR UPDATES BUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Too dark; no substance .all abot sex.  Don't think I wll read book 3 as it is said to be pretty much the same.
B0015AARJI|5.0|product quality, all very good, very good price. for ps3 lovers, this would be an excellent purchase for compatir with family and fun!. Recommended
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I bought the core i5 processor for a PC I was putting together in hopes it will meet my processing requirements since I couldn't afford at the time a core i7. It turned out that this processor exceeded my expectancy. I compared it to the Intel Core i7-3770 and it turned to be nearly as fast. You can't tell the difference and for 100 bucks less its a better choice.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is one of the coolest books I've ever read! It's awesome how Rick Riordan incorporates Greek mythology with fictional characters. I love this series of books. You won't be disappointed.<br />;)
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is a fun game to help pass the time when there is nothing else to do I would recommend this game to anyone
B007SGM084|5.0|i have been reading it over and over again. best book ever can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|harder than the first one but still really fun. I don't think I'll ever stop playing it. so addictive! love it!
0316069434|5.0|This was so hard to put down between times.  I thought the dogged pursuit on behalf of the victim was most compelling.  The resolution felt a bit contrived butwe don't want to lose Harry, do we?
B008TRUDAS|5.0|College Hoover, it took two books for me formalize  that I had found my perfect space. The Avert Brothers have seems  to play a cord on both of our hearts a time or two. Perfection.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|I like movie that keep you guessy what gone to happen next and you doing what and why? With this movie you have all of that and some sad part and people finding love in all that is gone on around them you don't know you next or what gone to happen, this movie is like The Happer you next know what happen and you next.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was an awesome game especially for an adult and avid mystery lover.  I have a difficult time with my eyes so this was just what I needed.  So hope to see more of these soon.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|When I started this book I had no expectations.  I had read WOOL and enjoyed it.  On to the next chapter so to speak and I got this one the day I finished the first book.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting it down.  It was excellent with very few dead spots.  Since reading Hugh's work I have started writing myself, he being the inspiration.<br /><br />\\"It's not rocket science\\" as they say and the book is elementary or will be to some but it's a spectacular story.  Worth the time.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|What differentiates this game from others like it is the order you need to do things in makes common sense.  You don't need to randomly go back to places you had previously examined.  The game understands how a real human would think.  Puzzles are challenging and different but not too hard.  Great graphics and entertaining story line.
B00B01XDTI|4.0|I'm a huge Silent Hill fan, from the video games to the movies.  I was pleased to see that Amazon allows you to buy movies for Instant Streaming before they are out on DVD.  While I didn't think this was as good as the first, it was still a good movie.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|Back in the 1972, I already had The Moodies albums \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\"  Then a high school classmate of mine (Thank you Mary Smith Hegna!) loaned me this earlier release from the Moody Blues in 1973.  I was pleasantly stunned and moved with Moodies creative juices on this album!  From then on, I was forever hooked as a \\"Moodies Freak\\", and proceded to obtain all of their releases!  The rest of my personal Moody Blues journey from that point is history and very predictable.  I'm still a full fledged Moodies Freak, have all their albums (group and solo) and have enjoyed seeing them in concert a number of times over the years!  But repeating, this wonderful album from Justin, John, Michael, Ray, & Graeme forever cemented me to this wonderful band, and my life and my love for music was NEVER the same!<br /><br />Alright, enough of all the alocades, and now the lowdown for \\"On The Threshold of A Dream\\" which originally released on the Deram label in early 1969.  The opening track \\"In The Beginning\\" with it's computerized greeting is a terrific liftoff and slides right into \\"Lovely To See You\\" written by Justin Hayward who, as usual, writes the strongest tracks on the album.  \\"Never Comes The Day, which originally opened Side 2 of the LP record version of this album is another winner written by Justin.  Those two songs, in my opinion are my favorites on this album.  Michael Pinder's haunting closing themes \\"Have You Heard (parts 1 & 2) with \\"The Voyage\\" inserted in the middle is perhaps his most stirring work with the mellotron on ANY Moodies album.  All the other tracks written by the group are equally top notch and enjoyable.  Like all The Moodies Classic 7 albums, one track slide effortlessly into the next in one continous flow.  All the bonus tracks included with this CD version are a neat addition here.  For the Moodies fan, another winning album and collection from one of the best rock bands in musical history.<br /><br />Now howabout a nomination for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for these guys????
B00122OCQI|5.0|This is a great example of musican who have been able to transend time and the all the other crap in the music industry.  If this is missing from your collection, add it today.
B0018BB21G|5.0|In May 1964, the Moody Blues formed their group which included Denny Laine (who in the 1970's became a member of Paul McCartney & Wings) and Clint Warwick. Their first album included a big hit with \\"Go Now,\\" and thereafter every attempt at having a successful followup single fizzled. In frustration, Laine and Warwick eventally left the group.  At that moment, The Moody Blues could have thrown in the towel and permanently called it quits.<br /><br />Nope. Didn't happen.  THANK GOD IT DIDN'T.......  When The Moody Blues in 1966 \\"reorganized\\" their group in adding lead guitarist/vocalist Justin Hayward and bassist/vocalist John Lodge, the band then ventured out with their debut album with their new lineup.  With the huge success of 1967's \\"Days oF Future Passed\\" which contained the hits \\"Tuesday Afternoon\\" and \\"Nights in White Satin\\", The Moody Blues serious attempt to duplicate that success in their followup album takes a very sharp turn of direction with \\"In Search of the Lost Chord.\\"<br /><br />Unlike \\"Days of Future Passed\\" which also featured The London Festival Orchestra, The Moodies on the 2nd of their \\"Core 7\\" albums didn't need an orchestra on this album...THEY LITERALLY BECAME IT, playing something like 33 instruments by themselves.  If there was an instrument they didn't know how to play that they wanted to incorporate into their recording, they would learn how to play it on the spot.  That, my friends is called REAL musical talent.<br /><br />\\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\" is perhaps the Moodies release that stands far apart from all others.  The songs have a lot to do with the social fabric so prevalent for its time in 1968, namely the drug culture (\\"Ride My See Saw\\" and \\"Legend Of A Mind\\"), astral projection (\\"The Best Way To Travel\\"), and trancendental meditation (\\"Om\\"). In fact, all the tracks on the original album of \\"Lost Chord\\" have been influenced in one way or another by these attributes.  \\"Legend of a Mind\\", which eventually became a Moody Blues staple and was performed at every Moodies concert until writer/flautist/vocalist Ray Thomas retired from the group in 2002 actually is poking fun at LSD guru Timothy Leary. \\"Ride My See Saw,\\" written by John Lodge has been the Moody Blues encore and closer at their concerts for many years.  Both are distinct highlights from this album.<br /><br />All the bonus tracks added onto the CD version of this album are an added plus and will truly be enjoyed by the Moodies fan.  \\"Simple Game\\", which was originally released as a single many years ago, but never appeared on ANY Moody Blues album until their \\"This is The Moody Blues\\" Greatest Hits package was released in 1974 pleasantly makes it onto \\"Lost Chord\\" as a bonus track.  Moodies fans will find lots here to enjoy in this entire set to appreciate while perhaps overlooking all questionable references listed previously. A nostalgic and \\"trippy\\" Moodies album release indeed, but another true classic from this legendary British band.<br /><br />As an added note, this album turns 45 years old this year.  How time flies when you're having fun!<br /><br />Now how about honoring these guys for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame?
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Also comes with 2, multi-CD made-for-TV movies as a bonus. Great price! Loved to watch Columbo growing up! And &#34;one more thing&#34;...buy it, you won't be sorry!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful, well written series! Combining history and romance giving us an insite into British life. The actors are amazing, the wardrobe, jewelry, scenery, all breath taking!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Frankl was a well respected scientist making great strides in psychology and neurology when, in 1942 he was taken to Auschwitz. He spent the next three years being moved around four concentration camps. During that time he studied himself and his fellow prisoners, looking at the factors that helped people survive such brutal conditions. He was already advocating a practice of logotherapy; people need to feel a purpose to their lives in order to overcome grief, guilt, and death. Through this lens he writes about his imprisonment and the importance of finding meaning to get through the experience.<br /><br />Frankl asserts that people can find meaning in three places; through some great work or achievement, in the love they hold for another person, and through suffering for a purpose. The first half of his book narrates his experiences in the concentration camps, while the second half details his his work and advocation of logotherapy as a &#34;humanized psychotherapy.&#34; I found both parts of the book to be intriguing.
B005KGPC4S|5.0|Red State is that rare thing a satirical romp and torture-porn set up,full of foul-mouthed zing,a riotous send-up of teen horror genre combined with an attack on religious fundamentalist and right-wing political ideologies.Kevin Smith has returned to his indie roots,a sparky-hazardous return to form.This is his best movie for a long time. Three young horny college boys looking for 3-way internet sex get lured into a honey trap with Melissa Leo,are drugged,tied up by an extremist,homophobic, Christian hate-cult.Mike Parks as the prophet figure Abin Cooper, a brilliant,Phelps-style cult leader,sinister,charismatic,simian who is the father of the inter-related group.The young guys are in cages and witness the killing of a gay man,scary,real.They attempt escape.They are to be made examples of to the congregation.A sense of an outsider anarchy and being out of control in a rapid turn-over of scenes, at the eye of the hurricane is along sermon scene which Parks makes magnetic as he spells out the evils of fornication and sodomy.Smith here and elsewhere does not play it safe,he takes chances.A storm is gathering.John Goodman is fun as the world-weary straight-talikng ATF officer Joe Keenan,who says the remarkable line,\\" You said this was going to be simple in and out sir?Simple just s*** itself.\\"  A chaotic energy ensues as Keenan leads his troops into an ear-splitting Branch Davidian-style shoot-`em up show down.It is violent,thought-provoking and funny.There are great action sequences,no punches are pulled,events are unpredictable and raggedy,issue-based and relevant,a judgement on our world today,a shocking ride through the minefield of middle America.The endingworked extremely well,loud trumpet blares,disarming the surviving congregants as if the Rapture has come.I wont say any more short of saying it's a beautiful wind up!Smith bravely distributed the film himself on a bus tour of cities and Sundance outside of the studio structures making his money back before it went on general release($4m). Maybe he run out of money and had to cut short the film,but it works.See Mike Parks om Youtube singing songs from the film.

B00B0NDF26|5.0|Tegan & Sara's album \\"Heartthrob\\" is the indie duo's attempt at a more mainstream pop sound.  Now is a good time to do so. Many artists (fun., Gotye, Ellie Goulding) that have achieved number one hits recently have done so with songs that find a middle ground between indie and mainstream pop. And Tegan & Sara do the same on this album.  It's mostly pop, but still retains indie elements. And it's a nice formula.  Pure indie music can be too challenging, and pure pop music can be bland.  Instead, the best of both worlds are combined - the catchiness of pop and the creativity of indie.<br /><br />All of the songs here have a synth-pop formula.  Most are upbeat, some are mid-tempo. Unlike their previous releases, there is little acoustic guitar.  The title \\"Heartthrob\\" is appropriate for this album.  The lyrical content of every song deals with love - sometimes heartbreak, sometimes joy.  And the lyrics are pretty introspective. Unlike other synth-pop albums, none of the songs deal with partying. The songs have some similarities to Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, and Robyn. Tegan and Sara's new sound is more indie than Katy Perry, yet more pop than Ellie Goulding.  To an extent, Tegan and Sara echo 80s synth-oriented new wave bands on this album. The synth beats sound both retro and modern.<br /><br />The stronger tracks on this album are \\"Closer\\", \\"I Was A Fool\\", \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\", \\"How Come You Don't Want Me\\", \\"Now I'm All Messed Up\\". \\"Closer\\" has the best chorus.  \\"I'm Not Your Hero\\" has the best lyrics.  \\"Now I'm All Messed Up\\" the best beats.<br /><br />Tegan and Sara have always been underrated as an indie band. Sadly, as a pop band, they'll likely remain underrated.  If you haven't checked them out, do so.

1878424319|5.0|This book will give you peace and help you on the quest for bliss and enlightenment.  I am now onto Don Miguel Ruiz's Mastery of Love.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A vibrant time and it was done so well to even see the clothes style change with the times.  The story line is captivating and not overwhelmingly sappy. Bravo!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great game it is so much fun to play, but when I go on and then just exit it won't let me go on the game anymore so I have to uninstall it and then reinstall it and lose all my saved stuff on it and it's really annoying cause I've had to do that twice and I just got this game last night
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Although the idea for the film isn't as original as when the Arnold version was released, its still a great film. The effects and scenery has changed, but still it plots a madman against the only man whom can bring him down. Great film.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! I also  love  the dragons I hibrid.But  I got  a gemstone island  and  the gemstone dragons cost gemstones wich cost real money;lukuly thats the only bad thing about it!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I have to say that I love this app the most. It really does make you concentrate and to challenge your skills.
B008SLAXGO|5.0|What I loved about it, is that I ordered it on the 29th and received it on the 1st, that's about the quickest I've ever gotten a package. I ordered two copies and both are flawless, the quality of the books are praise worthy. All in all, great purchase.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My oldest loves the crap out of this game. Everytime I see him he is playing this game. One of his favorites.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app is very intuitive.  I really am enjoying more restful sleep.  I used to wake up 2 or 3 times in the evening and sometimes have trouble falling back to sleep.  No more!  I wake up much less often and when I do I almost always nod right back off upon hearing the calming sounds of &#34;Ocean Waves&#34;.<br /><br />I had been thinking about buying a white noise generator for sleep, but now instead of a separate device, I have this wonderful app.<br /><br />Thanks TMSOFT!!!
B006OCM0G0|2.0|Didn't really like the game itself because sometimes it seemed confusing as far as the placing of some of the food.
B001MKQS4O|4.0|I know that the lead actor won the Academy Award for this, but I thought he overacted the part. There wasn't quite enough time for definition of his character as Capote for me to get a real sense of the personality. The movie itself was overall well put-together, but not riveting (although definitely disturbing) so I give it 4 Stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would recommend this to other that I know would love it. I think it's great and my husband likes it too.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Entertaining, nice futuristic special effects and plot twists. I give 4 Stars since it was well done, but not extraordinary, transcendent
B009PNQUXO|2.0|Haven't used the app fully so I cannot say whether I like it or not. I plan to use it soon.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|Clever mash-ups of well-known and not-so-well-known Beatles songs. And even among the most familiar tunes, (evidently) some of the source material comes from alternate (&#34;Anthology&#34;) takes. So this is a cry from the &#34;Beatles Movie Medley.&#34; I expected more outcry when this came out: messing with history, etc. Maybe George Martin's presence softened the blow. But you know what? If the Beatles were at their height today (i.e., during the mashup/remix era), they'd probably release something like this themselves.
0765325950|5.0|A great book, that brings together all parts of the story and a terrific build-up to the finale. Sanderson did a terrific job finishing Jordan's masterpiece.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|game is fun. time consuming, but fun. both of my kids like to watch the horse walk around the pasture. a little too complicated for young kids.
B003MDDGTE|4.0|Atmospheric and moody but they don't sound like everybody else. The guitar interplay is interesting: sometimes funky and sometimes brooding. The best examples of this are on the tracks &#34;Blue Blood,&#34; &#34;Black Gold,&#34; and &#34;Spanish Sahara.&#34; Well worth listening to.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a lot of fun you earn money and unlock characters the Rio map is interesting and fun! It's like temple run but more fun and for little kids!
B008MM9630|3.0|I haven't played the game long enough to give a full report but I find the buying of gems is really inconvenient. Especially since I bought this game because it was free.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great write.  A very hi tech story where nothing stretches the imagination and all the tech falls within what is possible with today's equipment and know how.  The character is challenged to survive in a hostile environment with the available resources. His training in the sciences chemistry/physics/botany are well applied in his effort to survive until a rescue mission is sent.  I was engrossed with the story and read it almost straight through.  I look forward to more stories by the author Andy Weir.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't put these down, Im on book three now, and all I can say is WOW :)<br />I wish everything I read kept me so entranced... and my Husband is more than happy letting me read...

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Finished 11/22/63 by Stephen king........finally.really enjoyed it. If it a fan of his I recommend it! Took me a long time as it is a long book.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|The storyline here would have been great on its own. The addition of those Others and the walking dead makes it ten times cooler. Great read if you're a Tolkien fan.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate. I like that I can read it in so many different versions. I also like the many plans I can choose from.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I bought this book as it comes quite highly recommended from a local bookstore that I have got very good books before. The book really started out great. The details of the flowers, the meaning, the use of the flowers to make the meaning brings in the sentimental value of everything that happens in the book to another level.<br /><br />Until... Maybe I'm cynical, maybe I am not likening the ridiculous, miraculous transformation of the character. Or maybe because I am not a mother, and to read about the experience of finding her child annoying, and she was barely even taking care of the infant, I checked out. I cannot stand to read the book after that point.<br /><br />The first half was very captivating, but I struggle to take the second half of the story to heart.

B00005MCX2|5.0|This is one of the best bands of the era. Not as well known as they should be. However, they get enough love from record collectors to make up for it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's a great time waster and has solid graphics. It's kind of like Temple run on steroids. There's 3 rows in which you run away from a cop after he catches you spray painting subway trains. You use missions to increase your multiplier up to the max (which is 30x). There are about 20 or thirty characters that you can buy with coins. And also several hoverboards. Hoverboards will give you a second chance if you crash or if the inspector catches you. The game designers are doing a \\"world tour\\" which is quite cool. First was New York city and now the game is played in Rio. With every new place you visit there are a special edition board and character. This is an awesome game.I highly recommend it
B00005MCX0|5.0|This is one of the best bands of the era. Not as well known as they should be. However, they get enough love from record collectors to make up for it.

B009AMALGM|1.0|Horrible entry. I was never scared one bit, even though I'm rather jumpy. The worst part is the ending. I wondered the whole time when some sort of climactic scene was coming. The 8 year old I watched this with found it more humorous than horror. I would not recommend this movie.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing is well below what I think most people would consider standard.  It's a fun and intriguing topic to read about however the author makes it painful by always using the same descriptions for the same movements of the characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is awesome, but beware the last show of the season. The last scene really made me so very mad! LOL
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoyed this story from the beginning... hooks u right away. Great plot twist. Can only hope that Amy got what she deserved in the end... Great characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game<br />I beat my friends scores<br />Brilliant game it has loads of characters to chose from and boards!<br />Also good on iPad Apple and iPod touch<br />Easy on KINDLE it has a big screen
B0035OC7PO|4.0|Bill Bryson is funny and entertaining. I like his quirky way of looking at things. This book is like a guided tour through Europe, with plenty of witty anectodes and observations. Educational, entertaining and well worth a read.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I bought my kindle to read books but once I downloaded Angry Birds I play it constantly.  My name is Linda and I'm a birdaholic!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A real page turner. Hard to put down. Liked the suspense. I give it 5 stars. John you know how to write them. Keep them coming!
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|When I first started the game it was a lot of fun.  Then I found myself just going around in circle and not getting anywhere so I deleted it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very enjoyable it is worthy the money spend. I did not pay for it, because it is free.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is fun daring and AWESOME... I love it so much my kindle is in love
B00APUTEBG|2.0|Not the worst chase movie I have seen but it is very close to it. With all these veteran actors it is such a big disappointment. Henry Cavill has mastered his American accent but does not have the skill to carry an entire movie like this. Not sure how he will do as Superman. Only recommended if you are really bored.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The story stayed strong through the second book. It gets tough to read with all the details sometimes but it wouldn't  the same without them. On to book three!
034580404X|1.0|I am at a loss to understand how these books could ever be introduced to the book market.<br />They have no evident plot, the characters are boring, the language is on kindergarten level and even the highly praised sex scenes are average. I stopped reading the first book at page 100 and never opened the second and third. The books' success can only be explained by the fact that no one has had the nerve to finish them and tries to recommend them to other people to see how much they can suffer ....
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My friend said to get it i got it and its perfect i love it its the best thing ever who hates it i mean come on its perfect
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It seemed very easy for Kevin to find her.  I thought it could have stretched it out more.<br /><br />I liked how descriptive it was with Erin and Kevin.  When she prepared dinner and so on.  You felt her tension.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This was a great book. I can't wait to read the rest of them..... I am starting to think that the book may be better than the tv series....
B000FBFN1U|3.0|If this was not the third book in the series, I don't believe it would hold my attention. That being said, I found this one a decent read. Martin certainly holds no character safe and gives no quarter to the commonly followed practice of keeping major players alive. There are answers here to some questions that I thought were already answered, and now new questions that have compelled me to pick up book number four.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really love this book it had me wondering what's going to happen next<br />I recommend this book to everyone who loves excitement and romance
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I saw an interview with Lucas claiming that artists during the renaissance painted over their own work or added to it all the time. He used this as justification for why he adds to his original Star Wars films.<br /><br />Lucas doesn't seem to understand that those artists did so for time and space reasons. They didn't get a new type of paintbrush and add in a joke or two to their piece. They didn't get new types of paint and make their past creations into cliches.<br /><br />That's what he has done. It's a nerd with a hobby...a billion dollar hobby that he can play around with. He forgets the people who made him and why, then makes it worse by acting like they are fools.<br /><br />Stay away from this until someone decides to remaster the original theatrical pieces and put them out. All we are doing is feeding the billion dollar hobby. With terrible added music, effects and high-jinks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it is so tn kiloo you guys really did y'all thing on this game I love this app.
B004RE29PO|5.0|I just watched Aliens again. I watch it every two or three years and every time, come to love it in a different way.<br /><br />Cameron had an interesting take on the film...he knew that he couldn't simply repeat what Scott had done on Alien and instead of trying to simply amp up the horror, added in the perspective of an advanced civilization taking on primitive enemies outside of their comfort zone. Truly a nod at Vietnam and now tied into wars like Iraq and Afghanistan.<br /><br />Like many Cameron films, the story is a bit weak in areas; for instance, it seems odd that no one was left on the Sulaco in case of emergencies...no crew or even an AI. However, one could pick out those small things and do a forest for the trees...the movie is good at taking you away though and putting you in the moment. Coupled with one of the sexiest and toughest female leads ever and you have a great flick.<br /><br />The only thing that didn't go over well with me in the special editions were the inclusion of several missing scenes that added little. Sometimes, they even made it worse, such as the added clip of Hudson droning on about the types of weapons they have while they are dropping. One of the best add-ins however, was showing the remote-turrets...revealing the firepower unable to stop the advancing aliens.<br /><br />Often copied and never equaled, Aliens was the epitome of what the great films of the 80's were good at minus the abundance of CGI now drenched over movies cut from the same cloth.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its fast its really cool and challenging thanks imangi studios. plzzzz get this app this app is woo amazingggggggggg
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Paul Krugman once said of Newt Gingrich \\"He's a stupid man's idea of what a smart person sounds like.\\"<br /><br />In that vein, Prometheus is a stupid man's idea of what a smart film is like.<br /><br />The constant comparisons to 2001 are ludicrous, as if by having a space-guy dissolve himself into a body of water and then not answering why is somehow \\"deep\\". The argument I make is that the film isn't actually mysterious nor intelligent but actually completely dumb. Add lazy as well...if you are going to be \\"smart\\" and \\"deep\\", don't waste time on useless story bits and dues ex plot movement just to move to the next scene. Put effort into it.<br /><br />I'm not going to rehash over everything that everyone else has said, suffice to say that the film could have been just as mysterious and beautiful without the terrible story thrown in. The roles that fill little purpose and do not move the story forward; the \\"gotcha\\" moments that were cliche when Alien came out. The twists that don't add up to anything at all.<br /><br />Scott still has a master's eye. That is not in doubt. What is in doubt is Scott's ability it seems to pick terrible stories or terrible writers to tell those stories. This is one such example. Where is the man who created Blade Runner?<br /><br />I give the film 2-stars if only for its beautiful rendering and eye for detail over CGI.
0385535147|4.0|i don't compulsively read john grisham, but i appreciate his writing skills and usually enjoy what he writes about.  this book had a good blurb and i decided to give it a try.  but, as is often the case, the blurb was misleading... it is really about how the government deals with informants and how convicted criminals manipulate each other and the criminal justice system.  the two murders were rather a parallel matter.  the suspense and the pace of events are exceptional for grisham, i believe.  it was a good read that was a little difficult to put aside.  it was also difficult to know just how likely such a scenario would be.
1594487154|5.0|I've been a professional seller my entire life, and wish I'd had this book to provide the lessons that have taken years to learn (usually the hard way). And I can tell you that Dan's thesis is not only correct - we ARE all in sales now - but his approach to the craft of selling is also correct. Highly recommended!
0988262592|5.0|It didn't take me long to read this book because as I read it, I kept finding a project I have worked on in there along with all of the foibles associated with it and the people who have done the work on it.  It was an accurate, though a bit more exaggerated description of the release cycles we dealt with.  I was able to see several people associated with that project in each of the characters.<br /><br />I would love to have some of the people who were on that project read this book.  The problem is, they wouldn't learn from it nor would they understand it.<br /><br />If you're an IT guy or gal, whether you're in Development, QA, or Operations, you will appreciate this book.  In fact, you can probably predict exactly where and why things will go wrong during the early part of the story.  The later stuff gave me some valuable insight into why we ask for some things and possibly some new things to start requesting from the developers and even the business folks in future.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although it wasn't the best of the series, it was second best. It was an interesting and entertaining read , but it did drag a bit in some areas.  I thought too much time was spent \\"underground\\" and not enough on the rebels' fighting.  The killing of Coin wasn't quite clear when it happened, but maybe because too much time was spent on Snow 's last moments --he was going to die, so kill him already!!  The series was entertaining and pleasurable to read...Am just sayin...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. It is cool you can go to Rio and. And it is free that is cool no games that is fun has not free. But only temple run and temple run 2 you. Should buy this game.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Very fun game.  I have only just started the game but I'm enjoying it soooooo much I think I'm already addicted to it.  Well worth the price.  Fun, fun, fun!!
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Cute, family-friendly adventures with a wealth of buried treasure scattered about for long-term arcade denizens. It's a fun twist on the sentimental framework established by Toy Story, but when the sight gags, winks and grins run out it feels a bit thin. The prologue hints at something really dense, vivid, expansive and bright, especially in the bad guys' support group scene that's featured in all the trailers, but the story never truly delivers on that potential. As a small-scale adventure it's just fine, and I certainly appreciated the efforts it made to secure so many cameos from classic gaming characters. It looks great, both in full 3D and pixelated 8-bit facsimile, and the voice acting is a series of loose, warm, top-notch efforts. The concept feels like it never gets fully off the ground, though, and a long layover in one particular game world puts the brakes on what was, until then, a slick, snappy pace. I guess at the end of the day, the comparisons to recent Pixar and Disney epics are inevitable, and it's a clear step or two below that level of prestige. A good, safe effort that's worth a lazy watch, but not exactly what I was hoping for.
1449410243|3.0|I got this for my daughter in law and looked through it. It had some fun things in it but it really didn't need to be for crude. Not sure I want to give it to her now.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Great cast and a fun little story.  Very much an independent film.  Not for kids, though.  If you liked Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this one.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I liked the book much better than the DVD, because of the close captioned in the movie.  The book flowed much better.  I could picture the scenario thru her eyes and her wanting to know about this child and followingit thru and having a child late in life herself and wanting her own &#34;sara&#34; so much and sharing it with the son who never knew his Mother and I believe it helped him accept her death much better.  I was 10 yrs. old when all this happened to Sara and her brother.  I have always been interested in that time, my Dad was in WWII.  When I went to school we were taught these things that happened, not like today.  Children have no idea in History that was taught in my era.  It is a lost generation to so many.  Since I am 78 yrs. young, I have a lot of history I have experienced in my life.  Several wars, of course.  Not a book or movie for just anyone, but it was a very good to remember those times again.

044654759X|5.0|I loved this book! It has to be one of my favorites that Nicholas Sparks has ever written. I always read his books and I was getting kind of tired of them because they seem like the same thing over and over. This one is different..it's still a love story but it has many different elements to it. If you are a fan of this author you will enjoy this book.

B0090SI4FG|3.0|Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is a policeman who murders a killer/rapist who has escaped the criminal justice system. He gets off using a self defense plea, however the mayor (Russell Crowe) has evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />We jump to seven years later. Billy, now a private detective, is living with the sister (Natalie Martinez as Natalie) of the victim of the man he killed. Natalie is an actress who is excited about her up and coming indie movie debut. Note to self: If you get naked in a film and make love to a man, tell your boyfriend before he sees it.<br /><br />Meanwhile Billy is asked by the crooked mayor to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who he believes is having an affair. It is an election year and he is running against young Connecticut carpetbagger Jack Valiant (Barry Pepper). Billy takes photos of the mayor's wife and Jack's campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) together. BTW the police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) doesn't like the mayor either.<br /><br />This early twist sets things up for later twists as Billy finds himself in over his head with feuding factions while trying to cope with his newly broken relationship.<br /><br />This film left me unfulfilled. Russell Crowe didn't sing, which is a plus. The characters were stiff and the dialouge stale. This is just another \\"me too\\" crime drama. Wait for the rental.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. Quick on screen sex scene, which may of had some even quicker nudity.

B0083Z6AH6|2.0|Like all Jane Austin novels, this was very class conscious, overly verbose, and difficult to relate to for a modern audience. It lacked the charm of some of her other books and the story dragged excessively. A long and wordy read, I would recommend reading \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" instead.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|i think this app is pretty good!  i love how the base of it is,<br />1) u were doing grafiti on a subway car<br />2) a fat police officer and his boston terrier caught u<br />3) u have to run for ur life while doging and jumping over signs, bushes, and trains.<br />i also think the officer needs to lay off the donuts.  hes really putting on weight.

0385537670|1.0|After reading this book, I tried some \\"new things\\" in the bedroom. Well, my husband did not enjoy them so much. All my girlfriends were saying how much their own husbands loved that they were reading this novel because it was turning them on and expanding their sex lives. Well, I was turned on, so I kept persisting with my husband. He wanted our sex life to be what it used to be, boring! Not only did he hurt my confidence and feelings, but made me realize I wanted a new man in my bed. After reading this book, I divorced my husband, joined a gym, got a Victoria's Secret credit card, and have casual sex with strangers.

B0075MFS9Y|2.0|Really? THIS is a hot Americana band? I added an extra star for decent musicianship, but this is not an impressive effort. The lead vocalist is just plain irritating, the lyrics are beyond obscure and the tunes all sound the same. I'm not wild about Mumford & Sons either, but that group outshines the Lumineers in every way.

B008JFUUQ2|5.0|If you're a fan of musicals and dance flicks, you'll love this movie. It's quirky and fun, the music is amazing and the dialogue is hilarious. The movie follows the Barden Bellas, an all-girls a cappella group who went from all-star to bottom rung due to a disastrous event at the a cappella finals. The main character, Beca, comes to campus as a freshman who's reluctant to get involved in anything at college, as where she really wants to be is Hollywood, making her way into the music industry with the goal of producing music. She joins the group as a new recruit and begins trying to mix things up, wanting to introduce new music to help the Bellas make it back to the top. Add in Jesse, another freshman who joined rival all-boys group the Treble-makers, as a potential love interest, and you've got a great story. Definitely recommend. *Note: Some of the humor is a bit crude, so stick to the rating suggestion and older audiences.*
B0045HCJQW|5.0|As someone who likes all kinds of movies, I thought that this selection would be a worthwhile watch. It was classic.

B000F1IQNM|5.0|Oh, how I wish life was so simple that a tap of a cane on the floor would bring about such improvement in children's behavior!  Every parent and teacher should be so lucky as to have a cane like Nanny McPhee's.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I read this book pretty much knowing how the book was going to end and yes, I do agree with the &#34;subtle Pygmalion storyline&#34;, but I must say that some of the reviewers who are obvioulsy quads or paras, are biased and understandbly so, but I must say this. My own Mother was 65 when she became a para after surgery for an aorta anuersym. And it was devastating to her. This to say, you don't know how anyone REALLY feels, even if you're (somewhat) in their situation. She had walked the earth all these years to be bedridden, etc.  Therefore, I could really, truly understand Will's feelings as to what had happened to him and sometimes, what you want, doesn't fit with somone else's vision of what you SHOULD want. I'm not saying this was great writing here, but it was productive, because it makes you think and yes, some people do want to die after being altered in that way. And that is their right. Read the book with an open mind. I personally enjoyed the book and it made me understand my Mother all the more.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I like this game because it gives me a little variety of levels.  The game is very similar to applying the stained glass in a shape.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Sexual descriptions are overdetailed<br />The plot, particularly the ending is overcontrived<br />Much inferior to his previous books such as Saturday and Atonement
B004GYY714|5.0|I wanted to listen to a local community radio station. On top of that, it was a secondary HD channel. I have a Kindle HD and could not get it to play. Thought I would just try this, since it was free and highly rated. Opened the app and the station I wanted was already listed in the options. So to reiterate, does exactly what I wanted.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I read a sample chapter and had to find out what happened. I enjoyed the way the author played the story out going back and forth between the past and present in order to give you little hints as to what was coming.  Sky's story tore at my heart and made me grieve for her when she came to realize what had happened in her past.  Holder is a teenage boy who had to face things that caused him to grow up so much faster than most and made him a more mature character than most teenage boys his age.  I love the meaning behind the name of the book, very creative. Some of the material in this book is difficult to read because it is so heartbreaking, but the author did a good job of not being over descriptive. Instead, she wrote it through the POV of a child, which made it more heartrending due to the innocence of the way it was told, but didn't force the reader to read descriptive information regarding such a topic, like some books have done. All in all, I gave this 5 stars because it never lost my attention even once! In fact, each time I had to put it down was torture!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Okay, I finally read this story. I kept hearing about other stories reminding people of Beautiful Disaster because this book was so good. I'm sorry although this book is good in its own right I didn't see much different with other books. There is always the bad boy using girls and getting tamed by the one girl who disses him in the beginning. It is so typical of these kinds of books. That being said I loved the story for what it is and I wish there was a part two.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I absolutely LOVE this game! it is better than the last and I love the mines. but the only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I'm constantly having to delete it then get it again on my kindle fire because I click on it multiple times and it just goes back to the home page. but other than that A-MA-ZING!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun and enjoyable game. Great for just relaxing around the house. It's really real in the aspect of taking care of a horse.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Was there no ending? The story was interesting and the characters were easy to get to know. The abrupt in was odd.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|After finishing this terrific read I topped it up with a visit to Salisbury Close and Cathedral.<br />It doesn't get much better than that.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Domestic abuse is a cancer on our society.  It pervades every social level.  This book gives another look at yet another person who is forced to find a safe haven wherever it can be found.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game nothing to complicated or challenging.  plus its an easy way to pass the time. five stats ....!
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I accidentally put in a random pin number and I can't fix it someone HELP ME OUT WITH THIS.but other than that it's not a bad game.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|A book that reminds us to appreciate, to keep our Faith, and to never stop believing for something better.  And, to never be scared to learn and experience New and better things.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is awesome..although I wish it was easier to gain energy for trainings and competition's..other than that good game
B00992CF6W|3.0|Where is the 6.1 version?  My son's friends are playing it and he can't join their games because this version is outdated... I uninstalled and reinstalled but it's still 5.0.. 6.1 version is available from Google play store but I dont want to pay for it again...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Way better than any temple running swipe and jump game out there. The coolest part is how they change locations as long with extras you can get, solid game.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The first temple run is much better, the second is to too confusing. Although different scenery, won't be playing it as much.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|At times it gets a bit repetitive with all the massacre going on but the story really envolves you making it hard to stop reading. I just loved it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have this on my iPad and phone and the update is not out yet on the amazon appstore.  I'm wondering when it'll come out. Can anyone help me? MOJANG I'm talking to you!
B0038M61BE|5.0|This would probably be the best one to recommend to someone just beginning to become interested in jazz instrumental music. Every track was played with passion you can feel. The biographical information about Art pepper on the sleeve was very interesting and inspired me to read more.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love the show and the books and just now read this comic....Amazing!!!!!!!! Better than the show!!!!!! Buy it buy it buy it it's sooooo worth it!!!!!
B000EWBKK8|1.0|This is my favorite movie and i ordered it and couldn't wait to get it. It came packaged just like any other REAL blu ray but when i popped it in my PS3 it wouldn't work so i tried 3 other blu rays i had and all 3 worked so i know it wasn't the PS3. Still i tried it in our BRAND NEW LG blu ray player and same thing. This is a junk fake foreign made rip off! Do not buy!
B00992CF6W|5.0|When will the 0.6.0 upgrade appear in the appstore, I'm getting annoyed and tired of waiting. Awesome game though.<br />Its very fun though, the action and the consept of building is amazing,
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|This is more of the revisionism that seems to be rampant in our media now. Instead of concentrating on our guys getting the very unpleasant duty of war done in the stoic manor that that generation had, it concentrates on making our troops look weak spirited, whiney, undisciplined, and just plain mean spirited to the enemy wounded. While there were some instances of that kind of behavior, the majority were not like that. The Japanese enemy, meanwhile are shown in a very sympathetic manner. THEY are brave, tenacious fighters. After four chapters, I have had enough. I will not watch the rest of this insulting crap! Shame on you Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.

B009ANP4F4|1.0|This wouldn't play on computers or TV.  Must be a different version.  Very confusing trying to determine which format fits which device.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun I can't quit playing no matter the age I think you'll love to play it on your free time<br />Subway surfer is amazing so many people play it
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games, but this series is better than The Hunger Games. I'm not kidding. You can cut the suspense with a knife and the action is blindingly fast! I read the series over the summer last year and since then about a dozen of my 7/8th graders have eagerly read it. They LOVE it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played on my kindle fire<br />I wish they would make more games like this one
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter insisted I read this so I already knew it would be wonderful--however,  I did not anticipate this little gem of a book would be THAT good.  It caught me off guard.<br />Fresh, snappy dialogue, compelling characters and true love.  Just read the book!
B003R5C5JE|5.0|very good, my soon is extremtly happy, he is a fanatic  soon he is playing a lot traveling throw time
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy doesn't disappoint in this thriller. His character development is top-notch and the story lines are totally plausible in the current world climate. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Making a zombie series rather than just a 1-1/2 hour movie allows the writers to add more character development and plot twists.<br /><br />This plus great casting, great camera work and cool zombie makeup make &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; better than any Zombie flick I've ever seen.<br /><br />Highly recommended for zombie fans!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This is, like other Wimpy Kid books, a spirited good read with a few laughs in it.  Not as enjoyable as \\"Cabin Fever,\\" but up to Wimpy Kid standards nevertheless.  It's all about Greg going to a school dance.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|Years ago my sister gave me the book \\"The Secret\\" and I put it on my bookshelf and forgot about it. Eventually I donated it to goodwill, never reading it. Fast forward to now. I saw the movie through my Amazon Prime and knew it to be worthy of trying.  I ordered \\"The Power\\" on my Kindle and have already noticed an improved outlook on life. I am full of anticipation as I begin practicing this new lifestyle.  I can only imagine the blessings in store for me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game's awesome I'm hooked!! The horses are pretty realistic and the scenery is amazing. I reccommend this game to any animal lover out there.
B0053O89U6|5.0|great show.  very funny and family friendly.  it's better if you watch it in order rather than here and there, so we get the seasons
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I really enjoy this game. If you like puzzles then this game will entertain your mind for sure. I would suggest any Big Fish game on the market. I downloaded this on to my Kindle Fire HD and it works just great.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I Love the app just, I did not get a update on the kindle fire when all my freind s did. I'M greatly disappointed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! My husband and our kids play also. We usually compete on who get the highest score.
B008B92U32|4.0|its good since i got it for free. It doesnt do what it can really do.  It is not so good with swapping, but i have to get used to it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love the game and I like they have to take care of the horse. I know show they will be fine if we get one of are own.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|when the upgrade happen with the subway Rio. It took my game back to the new start of the game and I was on<br />level 39 took away all my upgrades and all my character's I bought was a bunch of bs.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the game its basically the same as the first one just more challenging. I love the tunnel its honestly the best part. but it lags sometimes and it crashes often. :(
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.Demille is one my favorite authors and his sense of humor is in line with some his other works.
B00004YTXH|4.0|A very relaxing CD by a well known artist, one of his best.  Pity he is not well known in Australia
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I do not have much time to read do, I am still reading but it seems to be very good so far !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Between working a full time job and going to school I don't have much free time. Yet I was able to read an entire book from this trilogy 3 weekends in a row. This book was certainly worth the investment.<br />Great read.
0785829466|5.0|My book is beautiful and in perfect condition, I have always wanted the book,and love all movies on the title
0802473156|5.0|Wonderful book! It really explains how people love in different ways. It  shows how couples need to understand each other's love language and learn to be &#34;bilingual&#34; in order to  help their relationship succeed.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I loved the game at first, but then I tried to open it back up and it just kicked me off when it had the green 'I'm on the screen. do not get this game for kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think it was ok, the graphics are good but things are really expensive! that's just the game I guess.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Finally a physician has an experience that can't be explained away by science!<br />An easy read.  Couldn't put it down!  Read it in 2 days.<br />Great Job Dr. Alexander!<br /><br />g

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This the perfect idem to help as I work on confermation classes at my church. It helps me concentrate and organize my work.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was a quick read. I really enjoyed it and loved the characters. I wish there was more romance in it though.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Fast paced action with beautiful visuals of an Historic London.  Robert D is excellent with his side kick Watson helping.
030758836X|4.0|I could NOT put this book down. Honestly. It was such a page turner. It had a twist that I never saw coming in a million years. Wow. It's a great read. Do yourself a favor and read this. It will go quickly!
B00B49L7JY|3.0|Searching for Sugar Man tells the story of a singer songwriter named Rodriguez, who in the early 1970's wrote songs in America that were held on a high pedestal by top members of the record industry. Find out through this heartwarming documentary why he never achieved much notoriety in the U.S.A., but where his music did make an influence.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|An interesting and seldom-told history of Bob Marley and reggae with amazing archives and tour footage. Could this be love? YES!
0810996596|5.0|One of the best put together picture books I have ever seen (and also a great read), take an inside look into the collection of Kirk Hammett, guitar player for legendary rock band Metallica, boasting a mass of memorabilia from horror films past present and future.  This book will especially appeal to those who grew up in the 50's and 60's, who are still young at heart.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Nicely done spoof on Star Trek and similar space shows, but Galxay Quest also stands on its own.  Unlike some spoofs, this is not just a series of short gags which is thrown together to make a movie.  It has its own distinct plot and tempo.  If you've never watched Star Trek then some of the more subtle points may escape you, but the movie works fine anyway.  Galaxy Quest contains a winning combination of fun, clever, when you want to veg in front of the TV set and be entertained.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son and I love Star Wars and Angry birds. Great combination. If you just want to burn some time, this is a great game.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I liked this book because it gave suspense about what would happen to Thomas next. I especially liked the ending
B00992CF6W|2.0|Payment suck this app is to expansive can u even sign in to your real minecraft account  this app sucks
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I hate Facebook.  This is great for people who have no life and who want to share all the dribble and boring aspects of their lives.  For me it is a complete waste of time and plan to delete soon!
0698116496|3.0|When I got this I was thinking along the lines of goodnight moon but it is not as good.  My daughter doesn't like it as much either. It's ok and the pictures are cute.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is OK...not exciting...needs some work.  Might recommend to some of my friends and co workers.  If improved could be a viable product.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is a nice story. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer. Enjoyed the book on a quiet snowy day.
B005ZOCF5E|4.0|Review<br />Blue Remembered Earth.<br /> This is a different tack for Reynolds. His writing is just as good, albeit a little less dense.
0765325950|5.0|It kept up with the quality of all the previous books.  Was a good conclusion to the tale.  Loved it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg I'm so impressed I luv the game so much I've even bought coins with my own real money as far as I'm concerned it's the best game ever
B00B2V66VS|5.0|game is awsome cool amazing fantastic and the best part two to any game you have to get this game its awesome.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The characters are extremely flat and unrealistic. The structure and style of the writing seems quite odd as most sections are structured as a contract for a woman to become another man's sex slave; that's not okay. The writing appears extraordinarily simplistic; your IQ might drop a digit. This isn't contemporary literature; it's porn that's more sickening than sexy.
0596009208|4.0|This book absolutely served its purpose for me. I bought it because I had learnt java a long time ago and wanted to brush up on it. It's for anyone who is familiar with basic programming-oriented things like \\"what is a float/byte,\\" but who actually wants to LEARN JAVA. So, it doesn't waste time explaining these basics (which all programming books annoyingly do) but explains all the overarching concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand, yet detailed kind of way.<br /><br />Frankly, this book cleared up doubts I had from many of my Java textbooks from college. So, I would absolutely recommend this!<br />And I would also recommend it for beginners. It's not hard to google \\"what is a byte,\\" but it is hard to understand bigger concepts in Java!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's amazing! I love this game!! I love it anywhere an  on kindle it's better. On the iPod it always crashes :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a very great thing but I think you should make the Gus like different in speed and jumping ability. But other then that I think it is a great game and I want keep playing it. Good job.
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|The game is great but the pieces are smaller then I thought they would be. I still love playing monopoly.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it teaches u how to do it in life. I like it a lot yiyhigug huhugugu jhuhuguhuh hjhuihjjibj. bhhjhjhj jhhibj jhhub uhuhu
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent! After seeing the film, I knew I had to read the books.  Very well written! A joy to read!
1616550414|5.0|Being a hardcore Zelda fan, I couldn't wait until Hyrule Historia came out! Well worth the wait, as it is really great! The book is filled with reasons why the producers and whole Nintendo team made things they did. Reasons as to why certain characters wear what they do and what they resemble are explained. That is only the beginning! Excellent read to further your understanding of The Legend of Zelda franchise!

You can bookmark passages and create labels for easy future reference. Also, many versions are included. I have the app on my smartphone and computer, now to download on my Kindle Fire!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazingly inspirational and incredibly religious. I think we all long for Pi Pascal's ingenious mind. I expected this book to be very much like a regular survival guide, man against nature type. I was proven wrong and instead blown away. I would suggest this book to anyone and everyone. It does have some advanced vocabulary, but using context clues I think almost anyone could deciffer this piece of literature. I am fourteen years old and enjoyed this book very much. Well worth the cost.
B002ZG974M|5.0|This compelling and informative look at babies growing up in different cultures reminds you that babies will be babies no matter where they are.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put the book down! I have to say this is by far getting better and more real every time I read. I can't wait to download the third book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey - can't wait for each new program on Sun. night.  Really like Mary and Matthew plus Maggie Smith steals the show.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I don't have a lot of time to watch a series on TV so I tend to buy them as they come out.  i wish this was one I was watching as it goes on.  I really need to catch up first.  Great show and I like how you meet some people and then don't see them again for a nother few episodes.  Keep you on edge.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Although the plot hooks are heavy-handed and fairly predictable Downton remains one of the best TV shows to grace the screen.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Movie was pretty good but the effects were awesome.  I normally don't watch the extras but seeing how they did some of the fight scenes was cool
B006FE83UE|5.0|My family love this old black and white movie.  The children where heart warming and so was Peck.<br />I wanted this movie for a long time.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|One of the best musicals ever made by far, so unique and emotional. I definitely recommend this to anyone who can appreciate great acting. I promise  you won't be disappointed with this amazing film.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|This was funny and exciting.  I enjoyed it from start to finish.<br />I would say yes buy it.  great fun.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This game is amazing very addicting and I always wanted to play it if u want a game that will last quite a while this is your game
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one<br />Follett is a talented author<br />A master of moving history and peoples emotions
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's too small. Hurts your eyes. Screen should be larger, as well as the tiles. It should explain the difference between the different tiles when you are choosing your game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfed is the best game in the world no best game in the universe. I think that the Subway Surfer world tour is super duper fun. And it should get infinity awards.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It is my favorite game. It's done really well, but there are too many glitches. Credits are lost, or proper amounts are not credited. I have had a lot of problems with this game, but it is still my favorite. I see by the chats, that other people have the same problems.
1452110581|5.0|Initially, I bought this for me. After I read it, it was just so reflective of a cat's point of view, that I re-gifted it to another cat lover in the family. But now I miss the book, I may have to order another copy for me.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's a good time filler. I don't understand how you get rewards. It's not clear on that. When it shows the prize screen, it doesn't explain it, and also the carnival scene. What are you supposed to do?
B00AHXIC50|5.0|After his first album, i couldn't wait for the 2nd.  Gotta love it!<br />I too bought this song for his \\"locked out of heaven\\" single, but couldn't stop listening to it from start to finish.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book hit right to the heart very spectacular novel and highly recommended. My beliefs is the novel is better than the movie it's self but both stupendous.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven draws you in and doesn't let go. It takes you on an exciting ride with Katie as she starts her life over and learns to trust again. You will experience every emotion possible as the story unfolds and your heart will be pounding as the tale twists and turns in every direction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an addicting fun game!!! Once I got the game I couldn't put  it down!! Works great on a kindle fire! Has great quality! Over all a great game!
B007SGM084|2.0|I read a lot and wanted to see what the hoopla was all about with this trilogy. I haven't even finished the first book and doubt that I ever will. Too much of the same thing throughout. There are too many crazy people who act like Christian Grey, and too many women who go along with them just to get attention. Just read the newspaper, and you will know where these folks end up. Guess I'm used to reading a book that has some substance.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its a great app, but it needs to get the latest update. Overall though, it's one of the best games in the appstore
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is one of the most complete sets of Beatle recordings available. All of the CD's are terrific and if you are a big Beatles fan (like me) you will absolutely love this boxed set. A bit pricey but hey you can't beat the quality of the recordings. Be sure NOT TO BUY the cheaper knockoff version CD's as you will be extremely disappointed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Hard game. You don't do much. It's hard to earn money. You basically do the same thing. Still kinda fun. Passes very little time.
B0002HZLWI|5.0|I was very pleased with the Haba Block set. The blocks are nicely sized for small hands. In addition the blocks are very smooth and actually feel nice in your hand. Bought these for my grandsons and they love them.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I'm a guy from the US. I need GIRLS to talk to.not into boys. Not gay. Kik me bkentz1 thanks

B00992CF6W|5.0|If u get this, your AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Right Awesome dudes!? Creepers rock! POCKETINVEDITER pro rocks! I wish I can get 0.6.0 AND P.C. PIGS! PIGS! PIGS!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved the book so much because it really explains how it ess as to live in Brooklyn back then and it has a really good ending
B0059XTU1S|5.0|I teach students the book \\"The Hobbit' so I know it practically by heart. Eleven year olds have a strong identification with Bilbo, as you can imagine. I was a big fan of all the Lord of the Rings movies, so was very anxious to see this movie. I took the day off school to go to the premiere ! I got my big bag of popcorn and sat down to enjoy. And, enjoy I did. This movie is really good. It was easy to like the characters, feel for their motivations, and follow their journey to a homeland. I cried at one point, laughed at others and the three hours passed so fast I was sad when it ended. I hope to use the DVD in teaching (I currently use the old cartoon, the music in that is truly wonderful) as it will give good visuals to accompany the book. I even laminated my popcorn bag with the pictures of Bilbo and Gandalf to put over my Middle Earth tapestry map in the classroom. Put me down for notification when the DVD comes out, and I will pop out of the Shire to buy it.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Good story, plenty of action. Somewhat predictable in places, but with enough twists that it moved beyond being just another time travel story.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|These are not stories with a plot, but rather almost all are first person reminiscenses, observations, reactions.  The characters are very introspective.  Story endings often come without warning - the ending could have come several pages before or after.  It seems to depend on when the author seemed ready to stop rather than at a particular moment in the character's life.  The language is excellent and the stories are good literature.  In many cases, you just have to be ready to drift along without knowing where the story is going and focus on the identifications you can make with the descriptions of life circumstances the characters encounter.  You also enjoy insights into the Canada of small communities where the characters dwell.  There is a melancholy that runs through many of the stories.  Characters are complex, interesting, and varied.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow, just finished viewing Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  I love this show!  It was worth purchasing the entire season to view it in its entirety.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The writer's style is reminiscent of Malcolm Gladwell, weaving in ideas and stories in an engaging and interesting way.  I enjoyed examining both my personal and professional lives through the lens of the author's myriad examples of how and why habits form, change, and stick -  and I made a significant change in my exercise habits as a result of reading this book.  I've been recommending this book to others.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read lots of books on NDE's.  This one is different.  Great descriptions in wonderful detail of the other realms.  Lots of stuff to hold the attention of many different types of people.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|i think that this game is ok I needs a lot mote levels cause I beat the game in like a week
B009CPES4I|5.0|This movie will move you.  Actors are true pros.  Script is goood, touching and funny in parts...<br />liked it a lot!
0802130208|5.0|This book seems to be polarizing from what I am reading here-I adored it and yes I did laugh a lot<br /><br />on the other hand I have had recommendations to read David foster Wallace-I tried but unfortunately I didn't like his work at all<br /><br />Ignatius rocks that is all there is to it<br /><br />I'll put my mirrored sunglasses on and puff a cloud of smoke<br /><br />ooh wee-night of joy ;)
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|If I wasn't self employed,I would have lost my job.  Just couldn't put this book down. Thriller from front to back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You have to play its so fun!! You can try and beet your friends high scores and it can get hard to play but with the snow bored it will bring you back to life and there pretty! :)
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My five year old really enjoyed exploring this game, and I enjoyed helping him solve the puzzles. Is a classic adventure game, with an interesting gameply mechanic of changing the seasons. For ninety nine cents, five stars for sure.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Great movie for the entire family to sit down and enjoy a clean movie with jokes and quips that both young and old enjoyed.
B00280LYIC|4.0|The story is captivating and there is never a dull moment. A great choice for middle school level readers, especially boys.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! When I first played it I was shocked how funn it was. I thought it would were off but this game is great. whenever I get on the bus I always play with my BFF Drake. We all try to beat eachother. This game is great good buy.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|And looking forward to Season 2 - One drawback - do not like the OPENing credits - all the flashing of gross pictures - It takes away from the great series. I fast forward as I do like flashing-jittery pictures -  they are not in the stories.  Love that the same actors are playing different roles in this season.  Great acting and story-line - Alfred Hitchcock would agree.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Absolutely love it for my 160GB Ipod classic.. Works like a charm with my Jawbone Jambox!  Make sure you clear the Bluetooth history of any device you are attempting to pair.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game in the whole world! its awsome. I love how you can play against your friends on facebook. cool!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|If I had been a member of this band, this is the way I'd want to be remembered. Much thought and effort went into this very polished performance, it's refreshingly intimate style, and it's production value. Though some accuse it of starting out too mellow, particularly with an acoustic version of Hotel California, it was a good choice, showcasing the finger-picking talents of Felder and Walsh. To those of us who grew up in the era of 'that 70's Southern California sound', this one performance may not represent all the best songs but it does capture the feel of them, the way it was, and the way it will never be again. Walsh's \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row\\" is particularly poignant, and \\"The Last Resort\\" is very heartfelt here and doesn't even appear on the soon to be released on blu ray, \\"Farewell Tour in Melbourne\\", where Felder's absence is felt. Although I will purchase the Melbourne blu ray (it's still fabulous), it's too bad this one wasn't filmed in wide screen high definition as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is good but to slow to load mossy of the time. Bit for the most part good.Ra Ta Ra.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game I have ever played. Very fun to play. Am addicted to the game. You gotta play it.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Horror movies these days don't really scare people. The only horror movie to really creep someone out more recently is the<br />first Paranormal Activity. But that's now been done to death. All horror movies now a days are either remakes or go for shock  and become what is the newer term, \\"torture porn\\", until now. Sinister came along just in time for all of us to get our<br />Halloween chills and scared the crap out of America. I have seen a lot of horror. I even go for those really bad SyFy B-rated<br />ones for laughs. The newer horror doesn't scare because it's predictable and instead it disgusts me. The over use of torture and gore that have nothing to do with the plot. Sinister however does something different. Ethan Hawke plays the character of a true crime writer desperate to live his glory days, almost at the cost of his family. And he plays it well. The violence that actually has to do with the plot was creatively filmed. And because the story was unique and not a rehash, the creepy atmosphere and scare wasn't predictable. Halloween 25 is predictable. Michael Myers is going after a family member. Texas Chainsaw Massacre is predicatble. Leatherface is going to kill people with a chainsaw. Saw 10 (or whatever number they are on<br />now) is going to torture people in weird contraptions. The list goes on and you get the drift..... With Sinister, I didn't even see this movie coming. The trailer gave nothing away. It scared me. And that is what a horror movie should do.
B003K16P50|5.0|The story was original, the presentation of the Middle East and one of the leaders was quite enlightening, and the style was quite engaging.  And the addition of humor and poking fun at the West was a fresh touch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it and fun<br />I love it and cool<br />I love it and funny<br />l love it and exciting<br />I love it and crazy<br />I love it and woundful<br />I love it and amazing
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Amazeing its just a simple amazeing album the beats the songs just amazeing if anything i recomend this to anyone who loves techno and house music its just a wunderful album .:)
0141345659|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in some time.  John Green's channeling of a very bright 16-year-old girl is believable and engaging, and his humor highly entertaining.  The story tugs at my heartstrings, of course, and prompts me to think about death and dying from the perspective of kids with terminal cancer who mostly do not live past their teens. More than that, the book focuses on the meaning of life, what we leave behind, whether or not we make a mark in the world, and does it matter?  We are drawn into the everyday pain and challenges these terminal kids face, as well as their parents who must deal with the reality of losing their children and find ways to cope.  The story is brave and honest and real and so well-written that I can't help but love the characters and experience their joys and sorrows along with them.
1465001107|5.0|Love his yearly calendars, I collect them all (anything MJ) for that matter. They are collectors items; a keeper always
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really like this game of solitaire.  I like that it will complete the game for you when you reach a certain point.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Everyone in my family enjoys playing it. Easy enough for my 5 year old nephew and for me, his old aunt.
B0086700CM|4.0|A challenging game and never the same run.  However there is not an end to it, which leaves a feeling of incompletion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow, this release is a very worthy means of improving on the great work of the first. This version is pushier on the in game purchases, but still restrained and balanced, and obviously these guys deserve to be compensated fir their great work.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|When I first loaded this game, I reached a point and it froze up.  Had to delete and reload.  It does not credit the daily coins.  And I will not pay money for peanuts!!
B001GMH8RO|5.0|Loved  it i can watch this movie all the time its one  of the  best all time i liked it better in  blu ray
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More challenging than Temple Run.  Have not played it a lot yet, but I do enjoy the challenge of the chase.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Real science, real characters and extraordinary fun. I just finished it and I have yet to catch my breath.  Please Mr. Weir write another one soon.  G. Otte
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the most beautiful stories that I have ever read. A true love will always find a way even with the help of angels.
1451638450|5.0|Enjoyed this as I have all her Vor books. Unfortunately I had to buy the hardback. Last time I'll do that the Kindle is so much more convenient.  From now on I'll just skip books until they come out in the Kindle format.  I travel a lot and hardbacks are inconvenient.  That's why I haven't bought Memory of Light  and have stopped purchasing from the SF book club.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is enjoyable for horse lover's people who are looking for an intertaning game and whoever I enjoy hope you will to
B001I8A76A|5.0|I can't get the music out of my head or my car. Pink, where have you been all my life?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have been waited with baited breath since Temple Run 2 has been announced and the game did not let me down. I'm addicted!
B005636EA6|4.0|Run to this music. You won't be sorry. I love this cd b/c it makes me run faster. Suggested by someone else too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is a very fun game.  Temple run 2 is a different story.  Even better! It's very fast and fun, so be sure to play it.  I know you'll love it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Terrific tale told by the master storyteller.  King,s ability to convince his reader that this is really happening never ceases to amaze me.  Like Stevie Ray he never runs out of notes and just gets better with each performance.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|Good service and not a bad price either.  Well satisfied with price as well as quality of merchandise.  They produced what they promised.
B008N1V11U|5.0|with only a few failures to launch over the 3 weeks it took me to play through this game, this is by far one of the best games I've ever played on Android! Very much like some of the fun Superhero games on PS2. Very good quality graphics, and fun game play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesome I couldn't stop playing it there are zombies creepers skeletons and spiders trying to kill you awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lot's of fun.  Very quick.  Never a dull moment.  Keeps you on your toes.  Just remember to tilt, slide, and jump.

B009UX2YAC|3.0|Lack of response to touch screen makes game very frustrating at times...or is it supposed to respond that way;not jumping or moving latterly at times?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy this game! I just got it and I've made it past the 8X8. if you buy this, you won't regret it!
B00AKCJB44|4.0|So good. The Django soundtrack has swagger, drama and much much more. Listen to a few songs before you go the whole way. Freedom, Django and the song that plays while he is killing some dudes are all great.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Fun to read. Great for relaxing and thinking about nothing that might turn in to something that could actually be profound. . .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it!!!!  its really fun!!! its so fun like the gocart part its sooooooo fun u guys should all try it!!!! if u like it send me money!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Of course it's awesome, it's Temple Run 2, duh! Stop reading the reviews and just play the game already! I'm only taking the time to write this review cuz i wanna be part of the reason that they make a part 3!
030758836X|3.0|I really enjoy Gillians humor and her understanding of marriage. Although, I did feel the plot<br />was lacking.  Story did turn a bit far fetched.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I normally don't write reviews but this game is so addicting and I really love the different sceneries each month as well as the new ideas they come up with for power ups.  The creators of this game should receive an award not only for their creativity but for the detailed art work going into each months background, boards, and characters.  This game to me is way better than Temple run or Temple run 2.  If you like those games then you definately should check this game out.<br /><br />To give you an idea of how creative they are with this game.  In December they had Santa Claus and his raindeer chaising you.  In January you were running the tracks through New York City.  February you are running the tracks through Reno.  Each month you can purchase a limited edition Pearson or board.  If you don't buy them before the time runs out then they will not be available again.<br /><br />If this game was a game you had to pay for to up grade I would be one of the first to purchase it.  Truly awesume game.  And my thanks goes to the creaters and their very creative ideas.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|this is the best purchase that i had ever made, this is awesome, i will buy another one soon .

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an amazing game!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love trying to get more coins and trying to go as far as I can!
B001F6TXME|5.0|Not a whole lot to say other than it does what it's suposed to do. If you want your longer exposures to be sharp, I recommend getting this remote.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!!! Nicholas Sparks is an awesome writer!!!  I am addicted to his books!!! Can't wait to read more!!

B0052GACNM|4.0|Great mix of singers with Tony Bennett.  He should make more CDs like this.  His fans would love it lots.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. loved the original and feel like the brought a lot more to the table with this one
0743270754|5.0|I knew Lincoln was a great President before I read the book, but, until I read the book I never knew how great. His skills in dealing with people was extraordinary, especially his cabinet. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, all 700+ pages of it.
B001R1SUY4|4.0|I love this movie series, but I do not understand why some were on Amazon Prime, Instant Video and this one not.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had never read the comic books and yet am head over heels for this series.  The walkers have improved so much over the seasons, they appear to be decaying nicely over time.
0061726834|4.0|I stumbled across this at the library, and recognized the title as being suggested to people who liked Hunger Games.<br /><br />A few pages in, I'm intrigued by the premise and the writing. It does seem odd that 18 is an absolute cut-off for the procedure. Once I sat down to continue reading it,m I finished it quite quickly.<br /><br />At first, the logical part of me wondered \\"What's the problem?\\". Lena describes bad parents, and lawbreakers meeting a grisly end, but that also exists in the real world. It's great how the setting is sort of disturbing at first, but keeps on getting darker. Interesting how Lena's opinion totally changes instead of being a rebel from the start.<br /><br />Rebels interrupting the evaluations wearing cow costumes was amusing.<br /><br />The concert scenes and the bike riding details really seemed personal to me.<br /><br />I'm wondering if the Alex romance developed fast enough - perhaps what they did was limited by the age of the target audience. It sure was hot when they did meet. That seemed over the top at points, but it would be particularly special to Lena since it's a foreign concept to her. I was amused that he really did need to take his shirt off to use it for bandages.<br /><br />Hana was very interesting as a less committed rebel character.<br /><br />The complications at the end seemed realistic. I really wasn't sure how things were going to work out. Nice twists, Lauren Oliver.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|This horror movie is a definite must see by anybody who likes suspenseful thrillers/horror movies.  Jennifer Lawrence is definitely becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch for in movies coming out.  She's definitely great in this one.  I don't want to give the ending away because it's definitely different then movies I've seen lately.  I highly, highly recommend this movie.  The last thing I really liked about this movie is that it's not a gory horror film at all.  I was expecting it to be that way, but it's definitely not.
B00A2LOAKI|2.0|The Joker, a known psychopath and serial killer, is allowed on the set of a talk show, with no security inside. He has always used makeup to kill people and guess what- He brought his own! The \\"suspension of reality\\", necessary in all sic-fi and fantasy, is simply over the top and rates right up there with the ability of Hobbits to knock down Uruachi warriors with a few pebbles. (and before you say it- David had a slingshot!)<br />The psychiatrist is as shallow of an idiot as you will ever see- absolutely predictable and just plain silly- poorly written.<br /> One of the best things about the movies and other Batman titles is how the secondary characters are better developed- The more believable they are, the more \\"real\\"they are- the better the story. Are there really any \\"layers\\" of storytelling here? (Rhetorical question- answer is \\"no\\"). The new police commissioner is angry and predictably angry. Yes, she stands in contrast to Gordon- but that makes her shallow.<br />One final point- I'm generally conservative in my politics although NOT Republican (\\"the stupid party\\"). Despite this, I do not like the attitude of disrespect toward President Obama- I disagree with him on a number of issues, but I respect the office. Be mature and even gracious when voicing those disagreements... soooooo, what do you think about the writer's portrayal of former President Ronald Reagen?  When the writers decided to \\"take their shots\\" at him, they let us know beyond any doubt how they feel. Go back and look at how he was drawn. Look at his dialogue. This reveals a level of immaturity that all of us can fall prey to. Simply put: \\"Show some respect\\". Beyond the politics, a storyline is almost always disrupted when a writer has a clear agenda. When you dislike Reagan so much, it just bleeds through the script and the artwork. I didn't vote for president Obama, but I hate to see cartoon drawings of him with huge ears and a dopey look on his face. It goes both ways, and when you do this,you receive praise- but only from those that agree with you- all others simply tune you out and turn you off. It never leads to real change; besides, I bought this movie for Batman, not for a political viewpoint. I give 2 stars, rather than 1 for the artwork, and that alone.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|After a slow start, the story kicked in and proved to be as great a book as I had been led to believe...in fact, I've now read it for the second time. Can't wait to read book two in the trilogy.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|As a whole I enjoyed this trilogy. As with the other two books, it took me a while to get in to. The first half of the story was a lot of details, and trying to put them together... the action doesn't really start til later in the book. Elizabeth remains one of my favorite protagonists, all the more because she is such a strong female. She finally learns to trust...
B000P0J0G0|5.0|I haven't seen these shows in years, living in the states.  Still make me laugh until I cry.  What a great way to relax after a stressful day in the office!
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Absolutely hilarious!  Great Family film.  It's a classic film about a father being overprotective of his daughter.  The just happen to be Vampires.  Very funny movie.

B005OCHOZS|5.0|I have been a fan of Scott Jurek for years. I found this a fascinating memoir with some great vegan recipes mixed in.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|If you like raw bloody action this has some.<br />If you want to see one unlikely love triangle there's one of those.<br />If you like some mystery about who's going to kill or double cross who this has plenty.<br />Not for every one but definitely for the hardcore action lovers.
0345534379|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my grandson and he was very pleased to add this book to his collection.
B00AMS38YU|5.0|The story is fun and has some cool twists and turns, the bike riding action is great, the love interest is more of a side note which is nice for a change, in all I think this movie will surprise most folks and keep you interested.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This should have come with the plug. Disappointed  with the waiting and the omission of the plug. I should have read the description better.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It's a fantasy action flick, with vampires and action. The action scenes and special effects are top notch, throw in a secret life of good old Abe and you have a cool movie. If you are a strict historian look else were, this movie is for the Vampire / secret  soc. movie lovers.
0800141806|5.0|Another GREAT MOVIE, a roller coaster of feelings. The ebb and flow is tragic yet Love rise's to the surface.  Washington and Hanks are two of my favs. Almost Every movie is worthy of whiching.  LOVE IT
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|If you have seen the previews you get the story gist. Now sit back and enjoy the unfolding of the story, good action, good acting and a cool creative story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most epic game I have downloaded. Sure it costs alot but it's worth the money :). One thing... how do you upgrade it?

B00B2V66VS|3.0|I just got the app today and it has really changed my opinion.  The first temple run sucked, in my opinion, but this one is so much better!  Really addicting and fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot Bc it makes you feel like you are really there taking care. I like the different varieties

B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you were a fan of Temple Run, then you will love this game. Much smoother then the first one and being able to use power ups at will when you fill up your bar is always nice.<br /><br />Just a great game all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game it is so much fun wish it would link up with my phone through would be better

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever but all it needs is the end and armour but besides that it's Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008LV8TSU|1.0|I've only heard good things about this book from my nieces so I was disappointed to find it struggle to read this book. It has a great plot going for it, but I found the main characters of Sophie and Howl very tedious and dull. I was so bored that I was actually surprised and relieved when the ending finally came.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so so so so so great<br />fun to play so so so so so Sos os os so so so Sos Sos s Sos so so so Sos spa ss
030758836X|4.0|This is a fun, frustrating rollercoaster ride of a mystery. I was alternately cheering for the wife and then husband during the bulk of the story. I would turn to my friend who recommended it to me and say \\"these people are so effed up\\", \\"he deserves better  than her\\", then \\" no, I was wrong. She deserves better than him\\", \\" no, they're both crazy!\\".<br /><br />It carries you along and is quite engrossing. And then it just fails! The ending is so disappointing, but you can't stop yourself from staying on the ride until the end. As good as it was up to that point, I found myself feeling \\"why did I spend so much time with these people?\\" Yet, I don't truely regret reading it. Just be ready for a let down (which my friend did not feel).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good game because it is all about skill and there is many updates like the last one Rio subway surfers so it is a good game
B000F8O35U|5.0|When I purchased this it was about 15 dollars. I never used the second disk. I just loved the little mermaid when I was a little girl and I decided I wanted to have this as well as the other Disney movies I grew up watching. Someone borrowed it and never gave it back so I will be buying another copy...when the price goes back down.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I chose this rating because it was really funny. I liked how Jeff Kinney makes Greg so funny. I recommend this book to a lot of my friends who like Diary of a Wimpy kid books just as much as I do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Really loving the Pinterest app on my Kindle Fire. Easy to navigate. Easy to pin items from other websites. My only complaint is that the search function in the app is not as versatile as on the actual Pinterest website. One thing I absolutely LOVE though is being able to pull up one of my pinned recipes and have my Kindle propped up on the kitchen counter while I'm cooking!
B002XMGGJM|5.0|What can I say that someone else hasn't, this action packed movie was really good. All action movies that come out should be seen in blu-ray.
B00AU2B0DE|1.0|It is amazing having more than 2 weeks with no knews neither and asewr about the package. I need either the product or my MONEY BACK please
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Another good movie for blu-ray, sound and the action in the movie was just great. A must see in blu-ray format.
B000002JSP|3.0|After \\"Physical Graffiti\\" I just lost confidence in Led Zeppelin.  I don't know, maybe it was because they continued to sound the same while the music of the later seventies was changing, or it was because they started to sound like they were making a desperate cry to be heard amongst the schmaltzy pop sound of the late seventies.  I have this same struggle with groups like Rush, Genesis, The Moody Blues, and Yes. Somehow, they weren't unique anymore. They wanted to sound like their current competitors in the pop/rock genre.<br /><br />If Bonham hadn't died then I'm sure there would have been a few more Led Zeppelin albums through the eighties (\\"Coda\\" doesn't count because they were unreleased past recordings). And if Led Zeppelin continued to compete in the pop/rock market, they would have followed suit with the likes of Kansas, Heart, Foreigner, Yes, Steve Miller Band, and the such and would have truly lost it's original fan base even further so.<br /><br />Their song \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" is probably the bluesiest recording on the album which supports why we loved Led Zeppelin in the first place. That and \\"In The Evening.\\" But \\"Fool in the Rain\\" and \\"All of My Love\\" nearly made we want to vomit when I first heard them back then. \\"Hot Dog\\" is a simply ridiculous album filler, and \\"Carouselambra\\" was just too long and is easily forgettable.<br /><br />I guess I will always love the first Led Zeppelin album the most. I never get tired of it while all the other Led Zeppelin albums just sound as outdated as perhaps the late Bee Gees. \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" bores me to tears anymore because I heard it all my life.<br /><br />I can never just listen to this album in it's entirety. I have to hear these songs mixed up with the other Led Zeppelin songs.  Thank God for Sony's ATRAC CDR burning program, and for carousel CD players.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I fell in love with the Rocky movies all over again. I think blu-ray is  the best thing that came out, not only the picture detail but the sound was greaat.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hats it because I got tagbot it is a carictor and I bot a 85'000 doller hoverbord.( this is not with my real money)
B003F9G8B8|4.0|This was a very good film. We would watch it again. Great cast and great acting.<br />Went to look up the rules of Rugby when it was over
B006MPK9SU|5.0|Michael Connelly is always a great read and Angels Flight is one of his best. Couldn't put it down, very compelling.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|an amazing show of how hard it can be to own a horse but perhaps add a school for the kids to learn riding techniques and how to controlled there horses.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I love Harry Potter. Really love them all. I know from these books that Rowling knows about character development. The good guy needs a flaw and the villain needs some virtue. I guess when she started to write an adult novel, she threw that knowledge away. In Casual Vacancy there is a cast of characters that I would never want to meet. I didn't like anyone. The only good guy died on page 2. I was mildly intrigued by the teenage heroin addict but that's it. I might read her next novel but this one was a waste of my time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got to run a fun race! Also you can get a unicorn and a zebra.<br />It's awesome and I love it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is an entertaining book in as much as it brings closure to the Christian-Anastasia relationship in a very typical Hollywood ending!
B000J025AE|5.0|This was an excellent movie that is worth watching over and over<br />again. It is an excellent remake of The Poseidon Adventure.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Entertaining book but a bit repetitive as far as writing and expression goes.  If you are not looking for any major insights or take ways from a book but just want a casual, romantic page turner, this is it!
B0044JV1K6|5.0|This is a great movie for Chuck Norris fans. It is full of almost non-stop action<br />as well as &#34;father meets son&#34; drama.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Romantic page turner.  Bit much in terms of the content sometimes but you definitely want to know what will happen next!  Don't look for any deep meanings in the book.  It only has very superficial entertainment value in an erotic, romantic kind of way.  Terrible writing but gripping in a weird sort of way!  I have to admit, I couldn't put it down!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|These movies are a wonderful continuation of the classic television series.<br />I would recommend them to all Star Trek fans.
1603429999|5.0|I bought this book specially because I wanted to try knitting in the round and knitting with a \\"magic\\" loop on circular needs.<br />1. This book has excellent sized pictures are well as well written instructions. A few pictures are not a clear as I would like, but otherwise 90%+ are good.<br />2. It describes in detail various methods of cast-on and cast-off and which ones are appropriate for a specific project.<br />3. It is a tutorial on various techniques. The techniques featured go from simple to more difficult - something for everyone. It builds skills.<br />4. Contains excellent notes on correcting mistakes and common problems with knitting in the round.<br />5. It has some nice patterns for scarves, hats, shawls, mittens and a bag. Not a large selection, but has enough tips and advice to give me confidence. Each project has complete informaton about the yarn, yarn amount, gauge, needle size, etc. It also has featured techniques.<br />6. Gives advice on types of needles but not which brands to buy.<br />7. Layout is excellent and has plenty of pages to justify buying the book.<br />8. Type style is large enough for those of us who need it. Most of the print is on white background and the type set on the colored pages is in white, so that it can be seen.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game sometimes slow with ads.<br />Could be better with less ads and more levels to play against friends too
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|very good...one of those books that u don't want to put down. Want to finish the rest of the series of books
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a game is an awesome game with lots of obstacles and its a rush when it gets faster.
0060531053|5.0|He says it's very educational. He received a beer making kit last year for his birthday. I figured this would help motivate him to use it more often.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Very well done,I liked the way the  good guys made out well  and the bad guys got they're just deserts
B00B2V66VS|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT I PLAY IT FOR HOURS, TIMES REALLY FLIES, HOURS OF FUN FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY ADULTS AS WELL AS CHILDREN
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have this on my kindle fire, and 0.6.0 came out a few days ago and i can't get it! I am furious!
092389165X|5.0|Widely considered a masterpiece, this book was published as the entire edition of The New Yorker before it was released in book form, and it won a major poll as the most important piece of journalism in the 20th century.  It is not hard to see why once you begin reading it.  Hersey's piece is a careful, realistic description of what is actually involved in experiencing and surviving an atomic blast, told from the viewpoints of several real people who did just that: a young Japanese office worker, Toshiko Sasaki; a Japanese minister, Rev. Tanimoto; a German priest, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge; a successful physician, Dr. Fujii; a young surgeon, Dr. Sasaki and one or two others.  None of them were involved in the war effort - they were simply going about their business one August morning in Hiroshima when their worlds were completely, and for the most part permanently, turned upside down.<br /><br />Hersey describes in matter-of-fact fashion scenes that I had never heard of before, that I had perhaps only caught glimpses of in the most frightening, bizarre films or nightmares.  The silent, blinding flash, the sudden darkness, the strong winds, the falling particles - and later, the suffering of the dying, gathered together in hellish assemblages, and the clear-eyed observations of those fortunate enough to have survived sudden death and serious injury.  They were not, in most cases, fortunate enough to avoid the ongoing miseries of radiation sickness, with its myriad symptoms and effects, and a large part of the book is spent exploring this topic.<br /><br />The author practices a more discreet form of nonfiction writing than one customarily sees today; he is more the invisible observer and the communicator of information than a character in the text.  He seems to have a lot of respect for his subjects, and he portrays them compassionately and directly, without engaging in much criticism or analysis.  We witness these people in the days after the bomb, and we learn howthey were able to survive, but we are also shown the sometimes long and difficult roads they travelled back to ordinary living - and then later on (the book was updated in 1985) we see them as older people.  The young doctor, after working heroically following the bomb, eventually becomes a successful older doctor, with a family and a number of interests.  The German priest takes a Japanese name and develops a close relationships with one of the other survivors described in the book; she helps nurse him through his many radiation-related health problems.  The young minister gets involved with the famous American activist Dr. Norman Cousins, and becomes a leader of the survivors movement, before falling out with some of his fellow hibakusha (bomb-afflicted).  The young woman eventually becomes a nun, and the successful manager of a spiritual community.<br /><br />There were times when I was less than excited by Hershey's writing style, but I was never less than enthralled by his reportage or the great significance of the events set out in this book.  \\"Hiroshima\\" is part of the curriculum of some schools, but that is not enough - it should be required reading for everyone, especially for those who think the threat of nuclear war and proliferation is something that can be easily ignored.
030758836X|2.0|The couple starts out as annoyingly hip and self-obsessed, and it's downhill from there. I'm not a fan of stories of domestic ugliness, so I'm not sure why I kept reading. The plot's the thing in this novel; it's definitely a page-turner. Ignore your reasoned expectations and don't try to empathize or you'll be disappointed. If the author set out to write a book with no likeable characters at all, she certainly succeeded. Entertaining torture, if you're into that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great look inside how our military operates behind the lines and the kind of support and training they receive.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|umm lets see.<br /><br />pros:<br />compact fits in your pocket or on keychain or in a bug out bag very easily.<br />has a filing pick for serrated edges.<br />has a carbide and ceramic edge.<br />does actually seem to sharpen.<br />so friggin cheap!!!<br /><br />cons:<br />can be a bit too small in the hands of a man with larger hands.<br />filing pick def doesnt fit all serrations.<br />sharpening edges wear out very easily.<br /><br />worth it for the money. Yes.<br />depend on it for my life. maybe.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This thing rocks.... I was able to clock it using the ASRock Extreme 6 Z77 board at an astounding 4.8 GHz at 1.275 volts.  This chip is amazing!!<br /><br />I am cooling using the H80i water by Corsair.  During Prime95 testing, it can get upto 80+ degrees but during gaming, it never gets higher than 70 really.  Great chip, amazing value.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game had such good graphics and I enjoy the biggggg monkey.I just think they should add new characters and the characters from the original temple run.other then that it is awesome
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is the first full version app that I have purchased simply because the play through is excellent, the story flows along with the pace of the play and the puzzles are challenging. I have tried a lot of different free puzzle adventure apps that aren't nearly of this callaber. Good job G-5. Can't wait for the next one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really interesting and intense. It keeps me busy while I'm waiting for school to begin.its also free...
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I love the the boardgame that this came from and own android version. Its a great app that can be played with 1to 4 but seriously if you aren't familiar with rules go thru the tutorials because they did do a good job explaining them and it'll save you confusion down the road.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive I play for like two hours and can't quit but very good game all the graphics are very good and all the places that they put us were very good now hopefully they send us to more amazing places
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one! I love that it is an unconventional relationship and the communication that is shared between Gray and Steele.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book, reading it in its entirety in one day.  The writing is smooth and portrays excellent characterization. I highly recommend it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was ever so enchanting and brought together a number of different views of the circus through the decades. You actually felt you were in every scene, witnessing each chapter of the book!!  Definite movie material!!!  I highly recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is super easy to play and its extremely fun. This is a must have in your game library. Trust me u gotta give this game a shot.
B000FBJF3M|3.0|A bit too &#34;crude 21st century&#34; wordage, but interesting in concept.  I love a good ending too!  It was a bookclub selection.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|An all time classic. This is one of hollywoods best and finest. It begins and ends quite well. The love between Illsa and Rick is movie magic. So once more: Here's looking at you kid. Love it.
1444737112|5.0|My aunt in England told me about this lovely book when I mentioned my ex-husband was an addict she said this was very helpful to her as she loves cats and this is a true tale about the love of a cat and the help of love to an addict he found. And both were able to help each other with love, responsibility and love for their self.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read. It has so many twist and turns. You can't put it down. Loved it!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|this site was very confusing. i ended up logging off the site becausenothing i did on it would bring up the information i was looking for
B000N2HBSO|5.0|All I can say is read it, it is fabulous, an excellent well researched story of a seriously turbulent time in American History.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its ok but the only thing I don't like is that I cant figure out how to groom it. its kinds hard
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Génial!!!.Beaucoup plus marrant que temple run et aussi plus facile. Je vous le conseil vivement !!! En se moment c'est le tour du monde  et on est à Rio ,si vous le remarquer le policier est plus bronzé que dans le mode normal .Et ne vous inquiétez pas le jeu est gratuit.Bon jeu :)
B00884GR0W|3.0|I love the game but after three days it sed I don't own the game I am really confused pleas help
B000HIVIOW|5.0|My son and I love it. It didnt even take as long as it said it would to get here.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|This show has amazing acting, writing, and a deep story. If you are hesitant to watch it because of the zombies, don't be. I was at first, but it is more about the people surviving. It has love, friendship, betrayal, secrets, and intensity. I always had to watch another episode because it always leaves you hanging. The story plots and characters  are some of the best I have ever seen. Watch it from the beginning though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it it is much I cant stop playing it. get this game.  It makes me so happy I don't have to play those other games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book, read it in a week (I have 3 kids and was working full time). Great series with lots of twists.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Ive always loved his book, but this one i could actually picture every detail that was going ln from start to finish. It touched my heart deeply in ways i can not describe. All i can say is thank you Nicholas sparks for your amazing stories. You truly are one of a kind writer. <3 i just hope the movie lives up to the book like the notebook did.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Ordered electronically. Fast delivery to my tablet. Great story, I remember it from Jr. High and just had to order and read it again. I think and hope this book it still mandatory reading for these young kids as it is a very great book.
B00005N6KG|2.0|Years ago had the same headset, The pair i owned had been run over and still kept kicking. The recent pair was sat on and broke.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I have read all three of the series and they are great. I wish there was more. I would recommend this to everyone.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Should be required reading for all.  It is awesome. This book shows many aspects of Middle School but also life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well I love this game but I hate how everyone on iPods have 0.6.0 so now I'm sad and unhappy. But I want 0.6.0 with armour and stuff pls hurry thx
0793542049|5.0|This is the best book I could find for beginner jazz players, the info in front of the book would be good for any beginner, and the exercises are laid out in a very organized manner
0307595579|5.0|I read &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; in paperbound and decided I wanted a more permanent full set for my library.  I chose this over the set of North American hardbounds. There are no dust jackets, but the covers themselves are decorated thematically and the books are actual hardbounds, with pages sewn in signatures, not the cheap cropped-and-glued-paperbacks-with-cardboard covers that pass for hardbounds these days. The map, which is essential for following Dragon Tattoo, is included as endpaper!  This set is a solid purchase. I'm reading and enjoying &#34;The Girl Who Played with Fire&#34; now.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|We now have several of these.  The original came with the Kindle.  This functions well, does what it is supposed to do.<br />is easy to use, and now has a permanent home in my power strip.
B000WMEAKC|3.0|Based on my purchase of the album &#34;Waking Up&#34; I had high expectations. Given &#34;Dreaming Out Loud&#34; was made earlier in their career it wasn't up to the same quality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game temple run two is ten times better than temple run one.  New with added obstacles zip lines, indicates, giant monkey, etc.<br />The best Temple Run yet!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I really enjoy listening to my phillip phillips cd.  Very easy listening music and I followed him the whole time while on American Idol.  I would recommend this cd to everyone!
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Excellant another hit for Lee Child I absolutely love Jack Reaacher novels have read all of them and can't wait for more!
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Thi is one funny DVD. Great lines and a great story. I recommend getting this one. You need to watch this a few times to get it all.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The writing in this novel is much better than that of the 50 Shades Trilogy.  Still provides plenty of steamy scenes!  Great intro book to the Erotic Romance genre.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i liked the book and the movie but this time the book was beter it is  a must read so buy it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is great...it gives you a lot of cool ideas and there's a bunch of funny pictures. its great. I think you should download it. its just like tumblr and instagram
0061733199|5.0|this is the best book on outdoor survival i have ever read and i dont go into the woods without it.
1609611543|5.0|I know that sounds a bit exaggerated, but I have read this book along with several of my friends, and it is literally changing our health, dramatically.  I read it to just feel better, more vibrant since I was feeling kind of draggy.  I read the book, it made so much sense, even though it's totaly counter-intuitive.  Stop eating all of our &#34;Healthy Whole Grains&#34;?  Within 2 months I lost 20 pounds, feel better and really excited about my new lifestyle.  In a nutshell, it's about not eating any wheat products anymore, and getting away from all grains, as much as possible.  Two good friends at work read the book before me, one lost 40 pounds, the other 60!  To me, it's all about getting a new lifestyle where I can feel better, have more energy, and sleep better.  It's all wokring.  And it's all because of this book.  Of course, you have to be massively motivated to have the self-control to stop eating pizza, bread, rolls, pastries, pies, pasta, cookies, crackers, cakes and on and on.  But it's not just about junk food.  Wheat is in everything we eat...even soups and vegetarian meat substitutes!  And as so clearly evident, has an overall negative affect on the body.  So, I really recommend this book.  I've bought about 10 of them and have been giving it to people interested.  Our bellies are not beer bellies....they're wheat bellies!!

B00AWTTUHI|5.0|After watching the first part, I was captivated and fortunately enough I saw that feature the night of Part 2's release, not knowing that part 2 was out as of that day. I immediately watched the second installment and here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-It truly is a spectacle to see Frank Miller's work come to life and hold so true.<br /><br />-The voice acting is some of the best that I have heard for DC/Batman animated works and Bruce's voice felt right given his older stature.<br /><br />-Really blown away by the Joker's animation and shocked (in a good manner) that the animated film did not hold back on how violent his persona is and how Frank Miller portrayed him.<br /><br />-If you have not read Miller's work, you don't need to in order to enjoy these films to a high extent.<br /><br />-I believe this work is one of the best since Mask of the Phantasm meaning that I could definitely see myself re-watching this over and over again in both the near and distant future. That sort of plays into solidifying Batman into [more of] a legend [than before].<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Not for the faint of heart. This animated feature will become violent and there are scenes that highlight this in particular so I advise not watching this with kids.<br /><br />[note: this film was not necessarily made to appeal to a younger audience]<br /><br />-Juxtaposing the film with Part 1, it felt less grounded in a more realistic world, sort of a Nolan-esque type of world for the Dark Knight live action films. However, this should not be held as a deterrent for those wondering if they should watch it. Simply put, you should take the time to watch it.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend watching this film as well as looking to Miller's work. I must note that in his works that there is a subsequent series that ties in perfectly into the events of this Part 2 film that would lead you to believe that they will move forth with a Part 3.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is great, but has a huge bug. At times when you hit Save Me, the app just freezes and then closes, and that entire game gets lost.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wasnt expecting to be caught up in a<br /> teenage romance so entirely. The characters were hilarious and lovable, and their chemistry was palpable. I cried as much as I laughed, and was sad when it ended.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|I played this App and loved so I went ahead and spent the 5 dollars to play. Now that I have the full version it crashes and wont continue. I wish I could get my money back.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|as for me, an apple fan, it is the best choice to buy this book and to memorize the genius and his story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game.my little brothers and my mom and I all love to play it because it is just soo addicting and fun. I use this game as a \\"training\\" for temple run and temple run2.  I have had this game for about 2 weeks before the NYC edition and I love the RIO edition and the character Carmen.  The app material itself can load quicker because when I startup the app it takes FOREVER to load.  This may not be the company's fault but my kindle fire's fault.  overall this a great time wasting app.

0393316041|5.0|Feynman was not only a brilliant scientist, but a sort of accidental philosopher, and the overlap of those two aspects comes through clearly in this book.  Reading this book is like having a good conversation with one of your closest, smartest friends, and you come out feeling like you really ought to be doing something more with your life--in an inspirational sense, that is.<br /><br />This is a funny, touching, interesting, and generally excellent book.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was an incredible story- it's always the tragedies that tear you apart as well as pull you in. The mind games the plot plays with your mind get you so wrapped up that it is impossible to put it down or think about anything else. such an incredible book! I can't wait to get my hands on the sequel!

B009NPKTN6|3.0|My husband liked it quite well.  I was impressed at the actors doing their own singing.  All I knew of the movie was from the trailer, which had looked cute, and I didn't even know it was based on a Broadway musical.  If I had known, I would have ignored it, because I don't like musicals generally; that's why the relatively low rating.  That said, this one chose pretty good 80's music, and the performances are energetic.  There are quite a few special features on this Blu-ray (single disc), and it does come with an online copy.  The special features include comments from band members of the groups that made the songs popular, about the writing and their reaction to these performances; one on 80's hair-styles (!), and 80's clothing.  There are some comments from the actors, minus Tom Cruise.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I lived every minute of Charlie's experiences...such captivating depth. I absolutely loved the letter them...made it more personal and much more enjoyable!<br /><br />Fair warning...your not going to want to put this book down!<br /><br />This book is going to be hard to top!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Tonight I had my first chance to sit and listen to the new Blue Sky Riders’ CD Finally Home.  I have read several rave reviews, and was expecting quite a bit.  It blew me away.  I have always been a Kenny Loggins fan and I through the little samples I have heard I knew love both Gary Burr’s & Georgia Middleman’s voice.  Everything the reviews said was true.  Musically it is amazing.  The lyrics are insightful and mirror much of my journey the last year or so.  Overriding all the critical elements that might be included in a review written by head (which all are wonderful) is the reaction of my heart.  This album has me grinning.  It makes my heart happy.  I may decide on a favorite song or two, but right now it is simple a joy to listen to the whole album…over and over and over……
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a fantastic read.  I was skeptical at first given the self-published aspect but that was quickly relieved as the story began to unfold.  The twists and turns and visuals of this silo'd world made it difficult to put the book down.<br /><br />Someone needs to turn this into a movie - the action, visuals, and characters could so readily be a part of a fantastic sci-fi thriller!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|TED is one of the sites I value , so having TED in my pocket more or less is a desirable thing.

B000001DQI|5.0|Goodbye Yellow Brick Road is the quintessential Eton John album; the peak of his conceptual ambitions captured in a double LP that breezes through past and present exercises in rock n' roll, electric blues, soft rock, prog-rock, torch songs, honky tonk & reggae throughout a visor of nostalgia and an omnipresent reverence to pop culture.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is a love/hate kind of book. You'll either love everything about it or hate it. I loved it.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|A couple of years ago, my wife and I saw the musical live. While I liked it, I had a hard time following the plot from the cheap seats and regretted not shelling out $25 more per ticket for better spaces. I found it hard to follow and was frustrated because all I had ever heard was how great a story it was.<br /><br />This time, overall, I was very impressed. Apparently, the singing for musicals is traditionally recorded in studio months or weeks before shooting begins. Then, while the movie is being shot, the actors/actresses simply act out their scenes while lip-synching the songs. This time around, director Tom Hooper (big fan, more on him below) decided to switch things up and record the songs live while the scenes were being shot. The working theory was this would sacrifice some of the music quality but greatly enhance the dramatic effect. Great decision.<br /><br />Did some the singing suffer as a result? Undoubtedly. I am sure a recording studio track would have sounded much more proficient and pretty. In particular, a couple of Russell Crowe solos seemed to stretch his voice to the limit. The singing certainly doesn't approach the soaring heights of the [[ASIN:B004I2K4E8 Les Miserables: The 25th Anniversary Concert [Blu-ray]]] recorded in 2010. But, in the movie, the emotions were raw and the characters vulnerable throughout. In short, the acting was simply superb.<br /><br />The entire cast turned in great, emotionally-driven performances. Hugh Jackman was surprisingly powerful as Jean Valjean and more than ready for such a leading role. Anne Hathaway was gut-wrenchingly sorrowful as Fantine. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were terrifically scummy as the Thenardiers. Samantha Barks probably stole the show in her unforgettable performance as Eponine. Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried (the weakest links) both turned in solid performances as Javert, the grim and determined law officer, and Cosettte, Jean Valjean's adopted daughter, respectively.<br/><br />These performances were all under the watchful eye of Tom Hooper. Hooper, though far from a household name - for now - is proving to be one of Hollywood's most promising up-and-coming directors. He first received recognition for directing HBO's exceptional John Adams miniseries a few years back and his last time behind the camera was in 2010's The King's Speech. In short, there's not much Hooper oversees that isn't excellent. His decision to record the singing live as opposed to prerecording the tracks was not the only prescient decision he made.<br /><br />Of course, the songs of Les Miserables are much more poignant when one is properly following the plot! For instance, now I understand that when Jean Valjean belts out, \\"Who am I? I'm Jean Valjean\\" he is making a profound and terribly difficult decision by coming out of hiding and accepting the consequences for his long ago actions. More lyrics from the same song:<br /><br />If I speak, I am condemned.<br />If I stay silent, I am damned!<br /><br />These lyrics let us peek into the internal struggle of Valjean as he wrestles with his decision to turn himself in or to let another unjustly suffer in his place. He knows that if he turns himself in, he will be condemned to a life in prison. Indeed, he is, in essence, trading his life of luxury for a life in prison. But he also knows it's the right thing to do; hence his feeling of damnation from God if he doesn't do what his consciences declares to him to be right.<br /><br />Fantine's \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is a similarly powerful song about the naiveté of youth and the loss of innocence (mostly due to her premarital affair and subsequent unplanned pregnancy and birth of her daughter, Cosette).<br /><br />He slept a summer by my side<br />He filled my days with endless wonder<br />He took my childhood in his stride<br />But he was gone when autumn came<br /><br />And still I dream he'll come to me<br />That we will live the years together<br />But there are dreams that cannot be<br />And there are storms we cannot weather<br /><br />Now I am pretty sure I could have followed the plot in the movie even if I had not taken the time to read the book. My wife, who had the same trouble I did when we saw the musical, followed it much better this time around also and she has not had the benefit of reading Hugo's tome. The quick timelines appearing as text on the screen alone helped immensely. So I think it's safe to see the movie without already being familiar with the storyline. Of course, it could just be that my wife and I have had the benefit of seeing it twice.<br /><br />Hooper's rendition of the famous musical is simply superb; one of the best musical big screen adaptations in decades, in my humble opinion. Indeed, I think the movie might even resurrect the genre to a certain degree. It certainly has mainstream viability and the ability to capture fans, like me, that don't normally see these types of movies. I heartily recommend seeing the movie. It certainly deserves any and all of the attention and critical acclaim it receives this award season.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a very addictive game. Great way to waste some time! I reccomend a screen protector as this amount of swipping can easily scratch your screen quickly!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have this on my iphone too. how come kindle doesn't have the new update?!?!?! with signs? 0.6.0!!!!! it is not updated!!!! grrrr! fix and maybeu will get 5 stars!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had not heard of the series until the beginning of the third season (apparently I live under a large and comfortable rock!).  After watching the first show of season three I was hooked and absolutely HAD TO HAVE the first two seasons.  Delivery from Amazon to my computer was perfect, I've watched select shows more than once to get the details straight, and I'm a happy fan.  Thanks Amazon!

B00992CF6W|2.0|I have six boys.  Half of them have iPods and the other half have Kindle Fire HD's.  The IOS on the Apple iPods updated this app to 0.6.0 on 30 January 2013.  My boys have been waiting and waiting for this update - they were soooo excited when it was FINALLY available!!  But wait - where is the Amazon update?!?  Nope, not available yet!  Are you freaking kidding me Amazon?  I have three boys that are sooooo beyond disappointed in your products right now.  So they get to watch their brothers play the Minecraft App with all of the cool new updates, while they are still stuck with the old 0.5.0.  Not only that, but now that the iPods have updated and the Kindle Fires have not, they can not join each others games like they did when they were playing the same version.  We are HUGE Amazon people, but I have to say that in the future, should it come to a choice between an Apple product (maybe even an Android product) or an Amazon prodouct I will choose Apple all the way.  What a waste!  I hope you're listening Amazon!!  I am not the only one complaining!!<br /><br />Update - 2 February 2013:<br /><br />As of 1 February 2013 there is yet another update to the Minecraft App on the Apple Store to 0.6.1, but STILL no Kindle update.....  Very disappointing!<br /><br />Update - 7 February 2013<br /><br />Hooray - the KINDLE EDITION Minecraft App has finally updated today!!  It took more than a week from the Apple and Google updates, but whatever - my kids are finally happy and all able to again join each others games!!
