B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the way you can play this one.  Match anything anywhere. It was easy to down load and get started.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book was a big help, of course! It would  probably have been impossible for a first timer publisher such as myself to get a book ready without it, I think. However, even though I believe I followed all instructions, some text was inexplicably uploaded with space left at the end of some lines and the sentences would be continued on the next line. But it is very thoughtful and generous that this book is available for self-publishers to use at no cost.
B00B0CU2CI|3.0|Thought it would be better - just felt it never got going.  Was no plot to it was more a biography!
B009PAETCG|5.0|awesome game! I could play it all day long. I love to bend the ball and score a goal on the defender and the goalie!
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Purchased as a last minute christmas gift for my son - he loves the Terminator series, especially the ones with Arnold.  Low price and free shipping made the purchase a no-brainer!
B005URRCNQ|5.0|I've loved these two since Rubber Factory... They're huge now... which is strange, and I have to hear about bro's and tween's talking about them now - I'm glad they made it, however I do miss the small gritty $18 shows and not having to talk to hipsters about the Keys. Either way... I love this band and they always make great music. Every album is spotless and this album is there too. Glad I have it on vinyl finally.
B008RC72G8|3.0|Was somewhat disappointed with the movie - I remember watching the original, but expected more of the remake.  Acting was good, but the story line so-so.  Still glad I did not waste the money to see in the theaters.
B00007KWHO|5.0|Great album with great remastering and great bonus tracks. I would recommend this cd to fans of the early Yes period (1969-1980)
0449806901|1.0|This book might be good but I bought the audio version and hated the narrator. He sounds like he's 90 years old and makes jack reacher sound like an idiot. He uses some weird tone Shen he says his lines. Horrible!<br />I listened to another lee child audio book by a different barrator. The book is running blind and it was great!<br />I thought about writing to lee child to tell him he needs to stop using this old guy .
B00007KWI9|4.0|Great album, with a few bonus tracks! I Love the remastering on this album! Great tracks! Good version of this!
B009I2UH2W|4.0|The car charger for my new iphone works well, and is just the right length to do the job without getting in the way when it's not in use.  Reasonable price, too.
B000002J20|5.0|Either Everyone Loves This or Everyone Hates It! I Love It! Not Some Of Yes' Best Work, But It Is Great To Have In The Collection!
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie is long but good. It keeps you engaged with everyones story. The adventure is great you will like it
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|great classic Asia sound! I love this album! I Love tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Nice and easy game for a summer afternoon. Great way to sharpen your mental skills. Really enjoyed the problem solution.
B00CRW2066|5.0|A lotta layers of great music quality in this new The National's CD.  Seems one hears something new everytime you listen.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|All I have to say is...I'm getting ready to buy the next book!! This series is a must-read and I'm happy I purchased them!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game to play but needs some more levels there are only 10 now makes you think to play it
B00CFA225Y|4.0|The story is wonderful, if you have kids they will just love it, the 3d version is really good, if you own a good 3d TV. I would have given it a 5 but thought it was way too short and the story near the end lost a little of the cohesion because they wanted a hollywood ending.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|Came in brand new. Got it as a gift for a friend. She really enjoyed it, where I thought it was missing something! My friend loved it so I got my moneys worth.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem this farce of s movie. it didn't happen. Bid mistake.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|simple and nice environment - not difficult - always logical steps with increasing level difficulty - waiting for the next levels<br />congratulations to the creator(s)!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am completely hooked. Ads at the beginning of every hand are minimally annoying.  Being able to use your own photos as background and card backs is a nice bonus.Great app.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Get rid of energy things and Facebook if you did that it would be better. Those card things are a little annoying when ever you buy land
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! its so much fun having it on my kindle. I love playing it and competing with my friends on facebook.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an excellent workout for full body in 30 minutes. It is intense and you sweat a lot. I love Jillian's workouts. I've doing the workout for two weeks, and I am already seeing major results in my arms and thighs. I have my 30th reunion coming up and I need to get in shape, and this DVD is great for women.
B00004YRQA|5.0|. it's a memory card. Unless it was completely full of everyone else's. Games it really can't be that bad.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I like it, it is simple and very good graphics. I would like that the synthesized sounds were more similar to real.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|The album is impressive - virtually every one is already a hit.<br />There's times Bruno sounds a little like Michael Jackson.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an awesome and fun game.It's so fun and is ten times better than temple Duncan's is my favorite
B0094K1WZE|5.0|great to the end, I hope they make another, tom cruise is a natural as ethan hunt.  all the mission impossibles are fantastic.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I really like Yahoo Mail and have used it for years, so I was quite bothered when I got my Kindle Fire, and it wasn't on the device.  Then I discovered this app, and I was happy again--except for one thing:  no Yahoo calendar!  I learned a couple of ways to work around this issue on the Amazon help pages on this website, but they all seemed to be a bit too complex for a non-geek like me!  I don't see why Yahoo doesn't make a combo-app, putting the mail and calender together.  That would be a perfect app.  Until they do (or create a new Yahoo calendar app), I can't award five stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and challenging game! With each room having a different challenge you will never be bored. Can't wait to play some more...
B005LAII80|5.0|absolutely amazing reboot to the series. if you didn't like the original you're going to LOVE this movie. Cyber punk as hell.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book is highly entertaining and was cleverly written. Multiple stories come together to form a compelling, complex plot. I recommend it for all fans of zombie literature.
B004SM4IE0|5.0|First off, the book was delivered on time and was good quality.<br />Secondly, the story is great and try looking at the story as a whole to link all the events together. No spoilers, so just read it and enjoy it yourself.00
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Unlike the first two, I was glad it finally ended, not as gripping as the first two. Hard to follow as well, maybe just became bored with the whole thing
0316069434|3.0|Pleasurable but nuthin' special.Nice descriptions of locales, good character development, but the outcome was predictable. This is not the best of Connelly.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|I bought countdown to extinction for only 92 cents at mckays,the 1992 version,and it is the first megadeth cd ive owned.dave mustaine is a very talented guy and he is a good songwriter.he writes about stuff we all can relate to,like anxiety,pain,death,war,destruction.countdown to extinction is very epic.it is a metal classic for all headbangers out tnere.
B005S9ELY4|2.0|I didn't know what to expect before renting this movie, but the trailers and cast looked intersting enough so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />The best way to describe this flick is as a bad imitation of LA Confidential.  It tries to copy the character struggles but ends up coming off as too transparent and unbelievable.  It also is highly stylized, to the point where the costume and props are distracting to the story.  But the worst part is the screenplay, which seems like it was written without the benefit of any revisions whatsoever.  Most scenes have no transitions and the characters are insultingly simple and cliched.<br /><br />Its just a shame that more time wasn't spent on the screenplay becausemthe efforts of the cast were still pretty solid considering.<br /><br />All in all I'm left wondering how this screenplay could have been greenlighted.  You would think there would be some kind of review process to inject some semblance of logic and realism.  I was frequently dumbfounded at the level of stupidity of the characters as well as the screenwriters as they frequently took bIzare liberties with various scientific principals yet apparantly thought that the audience would gleefully overlook it.  It's a shame because the film and cast had definite potential.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie turned out so much better than I expected... it had a great sense of humor, didn't take the genre too seriously just had lots of fun.
B0052UYJDC|1.0|Nothing new here. Just another clueless new age rant. Honestly she has the mentality of a sock puppet. Some people do not want cast offs nor do they have the inclination or skill to DYI. Too simplistic. Glad I borrowed it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very challenging game as well as fun! really makes you think about what to do next! definitely a good buy
111846446X|4.0|I still haven't thought of the right application for this intriguing computer.  $25, runs on 5 watts of power, HDMI and composite video out, USB, OS and storage on a SDHC card.  This book overlaps the on-line documentation a bit, but it's well put together (physically and editorially).
B005K17RU0|1.0|I used to love this app. but I do not like the upgrade. Too cluttered. I like the older version much better. It was more appealing to look at before.
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|I love this game just to let you know it is a 2.00 difference from Ilario on there it is 3.00. but I'll. still buy it on hear
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like mahjong games. They are challenging once you get past the easy<br /> games. I have played mahjong on pogo. I would recommend this to anyone that like challenges.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is amazing how the Akinator eventually guesses who you are thinking of. I can't seem to stump him. You will know when he figures it out because he asks a question that is very unique to the character you are thinking of. Then their picture shows up. Very fun.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! I like the way they try to trick you in believing some parts are part of the clues when they aren't! Cant wait for the updates
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I TIVO'd the series but didn't get a chance to watch it until recently...now I am hooked and playing catch up. Please tell me the journalist gets eaten. Great characters, suspenseful stories, so good.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|had fun with the 10 floors that are already part of the game.  looking forward to the updates as they come out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I knew this book had been panned because some readers didn't like the ending.  I decided to read it anyway and am glad I did.  I was grabbed by the plot and could hardly stop reading until I reached the end.  I'm not so sure I agree with those who didn't like the ending.  Both of the characters were flawed and maybe they got what they wanted in the end.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|would give a 5 but based to much on real money.great graphics,easy controls.fun way to pass the the time away .
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best looking, and conceived game I've played. Exactly what I was looking for. I'm an old Myst, Riven fan, and the hidden object games just don't get it for me. THIS game is incredibly good-looking, and not too easy. Challenging without being unsolvable. I'm not finished yet. I've been playing in my spare time for about a week, so it's not a short game. Many levels. Totally glitch free for me on my Kindle Fire HD. Highly recommend if you like quality puzzles!
B0044WSGXI|1.0|This movie needs to be taken out of your library.  It would stop ever couple of minutes and I would have to restart it.  This happen through the entire movie.  It was a pain in the a___!  Please give me credit for this movie!!!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great heartfelt book great for readers of all ages and genres!  I would specifically recommend it to people 10 - 12
0688014291|5.0|It's a quick read - less than 30 minutes and well worth the time. I'm not a manager, but I still found the lessons worthwhile.
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Great story line, actors, and music. Anyone that loves NYC will love this show - wheather or not you go to the theater. This is NOT a show with poor plot and acting just to fill in the gaps between songs. The songs fit perfectly into the story line, and the songs...they are great!!!!! Amazon get this show back!!!!!!
B008XTVWHK|5.0|IT IS JUST AS GOOD NOW AT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT! I LOVE THE EXITEMENT AND THE ACTION!
B005LAIIMG|3.0|Pretty much after all the hype and watching the movie all you can say about it is \\"meh\\". While like with most zombie movies you know there really isn't going to be a real great deal of thought on the plot or characters and for the most part that's what happens in this movie. It feels like a mixture of 28 Days/Weeks later,I Am Legend and Dawn Of The Dead mixed into a blender and renamed World War Z.  The effects are good but in some cases seem overused and over the top some other times, the characters again aren't bad but their stories have been played over so many times that you can pretty much read what they're going to do before the actor/actress says their lines.<br /><br />If you have time to kill and don't mind going to see a zombie movie this is a alright choice but keep any expectations of any real original characters,story or plot out of your mind.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The direction of the story leads you to believe that love wins after all. Destroy the villain and all is well then why the disturbing end?
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I love Flipboard on my Android phone but I cannot seem to log in on my Kindle Fire HD so this is useless to me. :(<br /><br />Update: I was able to sign up for Flipboard with new login information and it now works wonderfully on my Kindle. I think the issue was that I created my account on Android via Facebook and for whatever reason, the Kindle version does not allow you to sign in via Facebook. It sucks because I had customized and things on my Android phone but in order to sync Flipboard on both devices, I had to login on my phone with the new account I created via my Kindle.<br /><br />Very aggravating.<br /><br />Also, I love being able to read all the things I want but I hate that I cannot exclude my social media updates from my cover stories. I have the apps for Facebook, IG, Twitter, etc., I do not need Flipboard to aggregate them into my cover stories as well.<br /><br />I suppose the easy fix is to just unlink the accounts but I link them so that I can share interesting stories to my social media accounts. I wish there were a way to fix this! I am tired of muting all my friends. It's too time consuming and having to login every time I want to share something is ridiculous.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I enjoyed Temple run and Temple run 2 but this is so much better! The graphics are beautiful, smooth transitions and progressively challenging. My teens and I love to compare scores! Truly well worth the cost!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|couldn't put it down. very very addicting. cant wait until they have more levels to play. a must get app
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I chose to read this book primarily because it was on the NY Times best seller list for MANY weeks.  I am so disappointed that readers have chosen this poorly written book about the empowerment of women.  I was so sickened I stopped reading, sorry I supported the author.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This man is the most amazing writer in this century. I have read everything he has written. &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;  was fascinating from the first word to the last. Then I read &#34;A thousand Splendid Suns&#34;  also by him. And I finally heard about his last novel &#34;And the Mountains Echoed.&#34; Which I am now reading. It has my attention from the moment I open my Kindle and begin reading. I am taking my time because it is so long between books. He is amazing!!
B000SW4DH6|5.0|I love this movie! It is packed full of interesting cinematography you would not expect and amazing music.  It is a bit odd having a musical include another musical inside of it, but this adds to the humor of the film.  The plot is quite predictable and follows a fairly common love scenario, with its own twist on things.  I really enjoy this movie whenever I am looking for a feel good romance with a bit of inappropriate humor in it.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|i love this app so much because it shows how to do different styles of hair and u can make the hair different colors it is the best makeup app ever
0596522347|5.0|Wish I had seen this 15+ years ago when I first started using PowerPoint for business presentations and college teaching! Clear, concise and chock-full of beautiful examples - truly inspirational, even for those of us who lack any artistic talent.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Just a great movie classic that should be in every movie collection.<br />Fun and entertaining movie with little bits of interesting Butch and Sundance facts scattered through it.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|This was, HANDS DOWN, the BEST role I have ever seen Jason Segel in!  The first time I watched this movie, I turned it off after a half hour.  The second time I watched it, I totally saw it as the \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" movie it is and watched it to the very good ending.  I has some one-liners that are truly laugh-out-loud!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel's acting is dazzling, very convincing about alcoholics' general predicaments and near impossibility to shake off the temptation at the sight of the booze on a lonely night.
B002WY65VU|4.0|The world has been taken over by zombies.  Woody Harrelson is a cowboy extraordinaire who finds entertainment in torturing zombies as well as killing them.  When he runs into Jesse Eisenberg, they team up...Jesse is much less \\"experienced\\" and worldly...while trying out different locations trying to find lost relatives.  They meet lots of zombies along the way, of course, but their worst surprise was running into Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin (who plays her sister).  The two girls trick them out of money, guns, gasoline, etc., but they all end up  together in a contentious trip with Woody Harrelson looking for the world's last Twinkies.  In one of the movie's absolutely FUNNIEST scenes, they run into Bill Murray, playing himself, in his mansion!  It's all really good fun but with lots of close calls and scary parts.  I recommend this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very interesting book.  If you think about it, it almost mirrors what is gone on in the Country today--our leaders pitting the poor against the wealthy.  We all live the American Dream and should not allow this to happen.  Worth the read even if you don't see the connection.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it. Much better than book 1.  Recommended for everyone. Hopefully book 2 will be just as good. Very excited
B009AOFNU4|1.0|The controller is so small, you cant play; but the big flaw is that this controller is only compatible with a limited and old game list. It is not a universal - plug n play gadget. Do not buy this fraud.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|Bruce  Willis does it again...I cannot believe all the action he packed into this video.  Need to get all of his &#34;Die Hard&#34; films out and play them one after another...think this one may just be the best one yet.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like his previous books, Hosseini provides a window into a culture that is totally foreign to most Americans. He shows us that people are people and no matter what our backgrounds, we all have hopes and dreams, tragedy and disappointments, and of course, love. HIs descriptive writing transports us to times and places in a way that makes you feel like you are there. He gives us deep character development as he gradually exposes the many relationships that weave into a wonderful story. Hosseini has a beautiful way with words and I'm sure he will be one of the must-read authors for generations to come.
B007SGM084|3.0|First book was good I was anxious and all but second and third book was the same they dragged. To much hype for a book that wasn't all that..
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|THIS WAS BY FAR THE WORST ATTEMPT TO MAKE A SEQUAL.THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE. THE DIRECTOR OF THE FILM HAD TO BE FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY AND WHO NEVER SAW THE WIZARD OF OZ  AS A CHILD. THE MUNCHKINS IN THE MOVIE WERE DOING SUMMERSAULTS FOR 30 SECONDS AND THEN YOU NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN.THEY ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MADE THE WIZARD OF OZ.WHERE DID HE GET THE PORCALIN DOLL THEME . IT STUNK AND MADE THE MOVIE STUPID AND BORING! NONE OF US COULD STAY INTERESTED IN THE MOVIE AND I DEFINITLY WOULD NEVER BUY IT OR RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE.MAYBE SOMEONE WILL MAKE A GOOD REMAKE OF THIS FLOP!
B000BDJ1OM|4.0|Sometimes you just need to hear Modonna again. This took me back and it's a fun one to have in the car. Admit it, you know the words and will sing along! &#34;papa don't preach...&#34;
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was awesome even though I didn't see that much drama on this one.......I still love the Crossfire novel and can't wait for the next book. Please Sylvia write it soon because I won't be able to handle the cross withdrawal. Sylvia is one of my favorite writers keep up the good work.
B000002LND|5.0|It's all the classics... you have to pop this in when driving and see how many people smile when they see you singing at stop lights. You know you want to go back to the '80s. Go buy this and have some fun.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Contrived, redundant, no depth in any of the main characters.  Started this book a year ago and put it down.  picked it up again because all my nieces raved about it.  I was very disappointed and will read no more Gillian Flynn
B00BIVN82M|5.0|This album is fun. He's having a great time with this CD, you can tell. So nice for the car.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Have watched it a few times and pickup more every time I watch it.  Frat story, awesome characters, not a history buff but seems realistic. Can't wait for season 2.
1577312082|5.0|At least for me.  Eckhart Tolle's voice is so soothing.....I can really grasp what he is saying....a winner for me
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I like these books - I am not a huge sic-fi nut but these book are really good.  I find the character to keep me wanting to come back for me.  I am hooked on the series now!
B0088X7YMS|4.0|CG movies should be done more often and at affordable prices.this was a good movie.Maybe continue the Starship Trooper line in this form,or all movie sequels?!
B005OLF6BI|5.0|The packaging was perfect. It came quickly and even after a year, it still is perfect. I would recommend this to anybody who couldn't make the live concert or who did and wants to remember it.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I put this comment before but ill do it again any way but it was real enjoyable I will be ordering more from you
B0033TJATW|3.0|missing a song .With M.J and Paul from the Beatles ,that's about all still love Micheal that's all i have to say
B0084IG8TM|4.0|well I figured this movie wouldn't be that great but I was wrong the plot of the movie looking like they are very poor
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The characters are beautifully intertwined with each other, beginning with a bedtime story which becomes the narrative for the book as it unfolds.  Mr. Hosseini is a terrific story teller with compassion for his country and the humanity of his characters.  I couldn't put it down.  I did find several of the characters difficult to fit in though.  In the end it all came together. I hope Husseini will continue to write about his culture.
B009K86D86|4.0|Very interesting and a lot scary.  We need to be responsible for our food if we want good, clean eating!
B005R32L66|5.0|It is a good way to connect with family and friends. My camera kinda messes up sometimes. But it is pretty good besides that
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I'm going to be honest I loved the first two books. I talked a good friend into reading them.  We were really looking forward to the LAST book of the TRILOGY.  I was bored.  Seems Ms. Day had to drag us along so she could write not one but two more books, really!!!!  As far as I'm concerned Gideon and Eva lived happily ever after because I'm not spending another $20.00 for two more books when I can get great stories for way way way less.
B006YC74E8|5.0|This app is way cool. I love it. I played around with it for a while and it was great. It is a very fun app
B00001U0E1|5.0|Learned a little Shakespeare while watching a delightful story.  We watched it on Netflix and just had to buy it!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love this so much it is so fun to play with. This app is so cool you should get it.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Great movie and a classic to have and keep? I look forward to the movie Rush that is coming out soon and will plan to purchase once available.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love how I can just pull down the top bar on my Kindle and see what the temp is without closing down whatever else I'm doing or going back to the home screen. Also, it pulls up links to local weather videos. I use it track several different locations and the transition is seamless.
B00633W614|4.0|Set in first half of 1900's about several generations.  Historical references interesting. Good reading for anyone doing family history research or interested in inheritance.
0316017930|5.0|I recomend this book to anyone. This book opened my eyes into another way of looking at success and how its achived. A must read.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Kinda run of the mill but still fun my 5 year old loved the movie so of course she likes this too.
0307272702|5.0|This is not a how-do diet book.  Actually, by the time you're done with the book, your understanding of the underlying principles may obviate the need for a \\"diet\\" book.  I so appreciate his thoroughgoing research and documentation.  Many doctors and associations (American Heart, American Diabetes, etc.) just spout the prevailing fad without checking out the underlying science.  Gary Taubes takes a solid look at the underlying science.  He also reminded me of things I had taught myself back in the late 60s.  At that time, I had put myself on a low-carb diet (without counting carbs, calories or anything else).  I lost gobs of weight and felt good in the process.  Shame on me for needing a Gary Taubes to remind me of the truths I learned then.  Read the book, remember the science, and give a copy to your doctor.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Good acting good writing. The fact that the cast gets along well is obvious. It is worth it to be able to see the show with no commercials amnd atr a time that you choose.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was great. I couldn't put it down and I can't say that for many books. Well written and thought out
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case looks great in white and it is very sturdy.  We also like the strap to hold the soft cover for the screen.
B0089XH38M|5.0|Who wouldn't want free, probably everyone, but AVG in my experience is the best ! I would even pay for the security and i have so I recommend this to anyone who's looking for protection and this AVG is on top of your apps you have !!!!*****♡♡  :)
B00454U1NS|5.0|These are the unedited for obscenity versions of Pink's greatest hits, and may offend some listeners. But, true to form, I don't think the tunes will disappoint. They are all solidly great musically. I don't think this artist could make a bad song if she tried, although I wish she could clean up the lyrics a bit.
B003AXAS60|5.0|What you see is what you get.and I like that.  Fast delivery.  Seems like it will last even when played with allot.  Small, which is what I wanted.  Well known maker.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun game, reminiscent of Mario and games like that. Haven't had any issues playing the game so far.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|One of the better mixes of history with a story. There was some Hollywood influence but that can't be avoided in a film like this. Excellent characters and acting. The film took the time to develop a plot and was a welcome relief to all of the run of the mill Hollywood crap. For every 100 movies they crank out there may be 4 or 5 worth watching, this is one of the ones worth watching. Jessica Chastain gave an incredible performance!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was just as good if not better than the first. Kept my interest and had many twists and turns.
B002XWXPC8|4.0|Light humor and good acting.Kind of like a big kid bunch of guys in a not too realistic story line.Everyone likes the underdog !
B004TMTCHW|4.0|Frankenstein is a classic for a reason. This novel is perfect for literary studies as it is rich with romanticism and full of description. Brimming with literary techniques and moral overtures, Frankenstein is a thought provoking gothic tragedy that is perfect for the classroom.
B002I8PVQA|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and acting.It held my interest all the way .I would recommend it to everyone.It has a Great ending.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game and whoever made it I applaud you. I've been searching for a mario-related game since forever. My new fab game.x
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|Anybody who rates this album under 4 stars has no idea what they are talking about. I've been following Bowie for 39 years and \\"The Next Day\\" is his best album since \\"Lodger.\\"
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Though a bit repetitive, I enjoyed reading Outliers. I would recommend this book to all readers who want/ need motivation.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Cant go wrong with Grease this was purchased for my daughter and she will watch it with her daughter as I watched it with my daughter.  We love this movie!  Old time Favorite!
B00004WNFZ|4.0|I have really enjoyed my LP, but I waited for a long long time, anyway I'd like to highlight the quick answer that I got when I reported the delay on the shipment.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|What a great show and the fire between now divorced Michael and Jennifer is electric- she seems to be literally screaming at home for cheating on her in real life.  Powerful!  Great acting.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Nice story with funny characters!  The orphan girls are very realistic.  Despicable me is not despicable at all!  A story with a message.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Leave it to the Brits to give us DRAMA and top notch acting- superb.  Sexy hunks Matthew, Thomas and Branson leave me weak!  What a great show- now time ti dive into Season III<br />Gary
B0076DELIG|5.0|Well thought out plot with clear organized writing.  Harry Bosch follows each trail of clues with dogged determination. Would recommend this book.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|I think it's just not my day. I downloaded this game on my kindle fire today, and it just freezes up on me. I got as far as typing my name in, that was it. I've played the game before in the past on my desk top. It was a wild tangent pop game I think. It was so much fun to play. I like breaking the chains, and the graphics, and the sound effects, bubbles popping sounds awesome. However the one star is just the experience that I am having with the free game, that I've downloaded on my kindle is all. I'm day having a bad day. :-( I just may turn back to my desk top and play games on it for a while, and give the kindle a rest.
B000274THQ|4.0|Goodbye Lenin is a good, heart warming film about the nostalgia old Communists felt for the pre 1989 East German. The conceit of an elderly woman who wakes up from a coma after the tumultuous events of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and cannot suffer any destabilising shocks lest they affect her condition, is very interesting. The plot revolves around her family doing everything they can to preserve the illusion of the Communist era - the pickles, the decor, the news broadcasts. This provides many moments of comedy and an interesting resolution that manages to present respect for Communist nostalgia, socialism and capitalism all at the same time.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|This was a great buy. Whole lot cheaper than I could buy anywhere else. Seem to be good quality batteries.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|disappointing, not nearly as good as his 1st book.  I read his 2nd book & that also wasn't up to the standard of the 1st book.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|I'm not sure who enjoys it more: my husband or my two year old! Great for the entire family. Clean entertainment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really think that u should get this game. it is super fun and any age above 5 I think can play it. the levels are all really fun different and unique in there own way. I rate this an easy 5 star. I hope they cone out with more levels soon or even better another game like this. many thumbs up.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The best way to enjoy music! The prices are cheap than iTunes which is always a nice plus. Will never stop using
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Some good sequences especially in last hour of film but this is a weak sequell to the very well done Trilogy - Ring series.
B008S847X2|2.0|I have about 30 John McLaughlin CDs and never know what to expect.  Usually I am pleasantly surprised.  Not this time.  I thought this would be like the Spain concert on you tube.  Nothing at all like it.  It is Speed Jazz.
B0026772N8|5.0|I read this many years ago in paperback, but lost it. Now I'm happy to have it again in kindle format so I will always have it to read. It is a wonderful story.
B006O2QNOU|5.0|I chose this rating because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The characters were well developed and the actors did a great job of revealing them and making them accessible to the viewer.
B00005MM01|5.0|Thanks for the quick response. A Donovan masterpiece. Nothing better to put babies to sleep with. I've used this record<br />for three generations now. Thanks again, D.T.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game it is very nice. waiting for more new levels which are more difficult and challenging.
B00BTZN91C|5.0|Who says seniors like me don't rock. I love it. All different sounds, some up beat, some smooth like Republic's signature style. I like their clean style of music. This album is a total winner.
B009R659L8|5.0|It is a great page  turner...Enjoyed it so much.  /the plot was so well thought out and the characters real.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Not even instaing the game based on three permissions. A game does not need that kind of info. One star.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I like all the suspicion, drama, and suspense, along with the hilarious and heartfelt moments. It's a truly great read. I would recommend it to people interested in fantasy.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Good job putting instructions in simple language even a caveman could understand! We will see how everything turns out as I use it more.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This was a great buy, I got everything as promised and it played flawlessly. I would buy this again from the same seller. Enjoy, its worth every penny.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Because of unbelievable picture quality, sound and of course a great movie I give 5 stars.I strongly recommend this movie.
B008HK3XKO|3.0|Bought this case for my son because I really like Marware products but found the Moko slim line case that my husband has for his Nexus 7. That case is so slim and not as heavy so I bought 2 of them and returned this one and another one I had on my Kindle hd. Thanks Amazon for easy returns!
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you are ready for a great workout, then give this one a try.  She kicks butt, but in a good way.  You really work up a sweat.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love bingo?  Lots of places to visit and play.  The more you play the more choices.  Prefer slots?  Got that too!  Depending how addicted you are you can usually play for free.  On the down side the screen infrequently freezes and you keep winning the same jewel over and over.  I stayed playing as a guest because I didn't want it shownon fb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun it keeps me very busy. I can be at the doctors time go so fast I don't even mind waiting
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|well developed characters that you cannot help but really care about! I loved this book, the story was sweet with some heartbreaking early history.I was travelling thru ireland as I read it, and the whole book really resonated with truth,<br />lovely!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It keeps me busy an  I like that is a mind using game which is something I have been looking for all this time.... I recommend this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Frustrating when you can't figure out the clues&hellip;but so satisfying when the door opens! I love this game. It makes you think.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty good.  Challenging. Although a little annoyed with trying to figure out what number/code went where. No rationale. But maybe that is the game?
0062255657|4.0|This novel provides pure enjoyment. As an AP teacher, I am often drawn to works that require \\"deep\\" thinking and analyzing.  While I was prepared to do this, I found myself falling in love with reading - like when I was a child - for no other reason than enjoying a story.  I read for the pure enjoyment of it.  Even though there were few \\"answers\\" in this novel - and nothing was plausible - I didn't care.  The suspense was maintained AND I cared about the characters for no other reason than I felt transported to another world where neighbors care for each other. This novel is similar to a fairy tale in that it includes monsters, evil critters, virtuous youth, and familial strife. I highly recommend this novel.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is great for weather updates.  I was hoping to find something that would issue warnings by activating the kindle with an alarm sound.  Maybe that doesn't exist yet.
B00D8WJ9JK|4.0|This album is true hip-hop... but it not as good as his first one. I am really enjoying it though
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. I like the way it makes me think. I can feel my brain getting smarter.
B00C061I3K|5.0|After listening to Get Lucky on the radio a couple times, I had high hopes for this album. I have been a fan of Daft Punk since I first heard their songs in 1997. I have always enjoyed their incorporation of funk into EDM and French House music. RAM is not the same Daft Punk that people have grown familiar with. If people were expecting a heavy electronic sound in this album similar to their Tron: Legacy soundtrack then they would be disappointed. What this album is is a throwback to 70's and 80's Disco and dance music. It is wonderfully thought out and recorded. It introduces a whole generation of listeners to genres of music and artists they haven't listened to before. While it might not match the hype that accompanied it, this album is a must buy for any Daft Punk fan. Sit down and listen to the whole album and not just one or two songs. Enjoy.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|my daughter needed hearts so I played.  now she stopped but I am still playing. fun game.  in app purchases so put a block on my daughters version.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|love it it was a lot of fun to watch and the music was great. you can watch it again and again...
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is the sequel to the adventurous book The Maze Runner. In The Scorch Trials they are brought to The Scorch, a place with little to no water and many storms while the weather is never under 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Will they survive? Read the book for more!
1490313370|4.0|What do you have to lose? He'll refund you the purchase price of the book if you don't like it.<br /><br />He meanders a bit and sometimes it's clear that he's writing each chapter with a word quota in mind, but at the same time his patter and tone is so accessible and welcome it's like listening to a trusted friend rant about things that are very important to him after he's had a couple strong drinks.<br /><br />I liked it enough that I didn't bother to ask him to refund me.<br /><br />As far as content goes it seems to me that he's channeling (and heavily diluting) important lessons from Steve Pavlina. Pavlina is indisputably the better author but Steve won't pay you back if you don't like his book!<br /><br />It's a quick read, and risk free - so go for it.<br /><br />I'd give it five stars if it weren't so obvious in some passages that he completely forgot what he was talking about...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|My kiddo and I had a fun time playing this game. We enjoy looking for the needed items to move to the next level. Need more floors!
1439130833|2.0|unfortunately It was not the one i ordered..! i  had expected more out of it and did not match my expectations...
1439152802|5.0|A great read. Kate Morton has a fantastic way of pulling you into the intricate weave of the story line.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|You  should get the game it is lots of fun  and  I think you will like it to<br />And you should watch the show  on hub network
B005EGXTHG|3.0|Still enjoyable, but story is turning to complex and less believable.<br />I heard last book is really good though.  so not giving up on them yet.
B004PIKPTY|1.0|I gave it &#34;I hate it&#34; because the cord got a little bit twisted and it broke.. Mic doesn't work.. Sound doesn't work... Horrible product, wouldn't recommend for durability.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Book is concise and easy to read. I did not think there was any grand advice, but there are a number of tips that an individual can benefit from depending on his or her situation.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is one of the best apps ive ever had u guys should get it it really is a five start app
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty fun game only wish there was a little bit more of an explaination of the levels other than that good time killer
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Nice  synopsis of  true  spiritual  living. Helpful,  clearly<br />written.  Highly recommend for those seeking  meaning and purpose in life.  Worthwhile!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Bad acting, bad actors, bad writing, etc..... Special effects were borderline, the cracked ceramic doll was phalic, this film is for the lowest common denominator.  I feel sorry for kids that they market these type of movies to.  Watch Pippi Longstockinging, something that isn't over the top and trying too hard to be cool.  And BTW, we really don't need a backstory to The Wizard of Oz. This movie was made to employ c list actors who probably won't be around, so yeah make your money, I won't be buying it.
B000001FDK|5.0|The original Grease is an excellent movie and so is the sound track. The later versions  could never touch the origiinal that includes sound track and picture.
B003G4W49C|4.0|From what I've read, I feel that author Card likes to tell his tales from the pre-adolescent viewpoint. The stories are engaging yet the final outcome is almost always easy to predict.<br />Still it is good reading (kinda like well writen short stories pieced together together in chapter sized bites :D )
B007NQLK3K|2.0|This figure may look cool, and it may be \\"super poseable\\" because it's made by Revoltech, for some reason, when it comes to Transformers, Revoltech just can't get it right. I have to ask what material do they mold these out of, because for some reason they always have molding errors. The holes the joints go into aren't even, and certain details are off. This figure comes with accessories, such as changeable hands, a gun arm, and even a head with the battle mask down. Now that is cool, and I don't mind interchanging parts, but my battle mask head didn't even have the \\"eyes\\" painted. Another issue is that, they claim it's super poseable, but this thing feels VERY limited in terms of motion. He has shoulders, yet doesn't bend at the shoulder, he bends at joints that are very close to the neck, and his legs have double joints, yet due to the design and mold of the figure, the legs only bend to a 90 degree angle. Why is it no matter what, no one can get it right? I'm sorry, I know it sounds picky, but these guys wrote a check that the figure didn't cash, and speaking of money, I bought this when it was 60 dollars. This was not worth 60, more like... 20. Why is it so high, because it's imported from Japan? Much like the Takara Tomy figures, which are just the same figures with better paint jobs, they're not worth the higher price. While it's the best attempt we're gonna get, I'd like to see someone try harder.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I enjoyed reading the stories in this book.  It made me think.  I suppose it does take more than 10,000 hours of practice to become a top notch musician or athlete or scholar.  Success does take more than just brains and hard work. Success also involves being in the right place at the right time and some luck.  I agreed with everything in the book.  It makes me sad for the intelligent and hard working people who are not successful for any number of reasons beyond their control.  Some people come from home where the parents are a hindrance to their children. Other people have a skin color or religion that is being discriminated against.  That is unfair.  As a wealthy society we lose out on great talent and ability when we don't give a chance to people who are different from us.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|These adapters work fine.  Useful for continuing to use our old mac power cords.  I bought a bunch of them.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book.  I has many twists and turns making it nearly impossible to predict.  My one criticism is that the cuss words are over used.
B000PA9Q6E|4.0|All in all, I found this to be a satisfying live recording. If you are a blues fan, I'm sure this one will make you smile. For my tastes, however, there is too much Johnny Winter, at times overwhelming the presence of the great Muddy Waters. Every time Johnny yelps a \\"Yeaahh\\" during one of Muddy's songs, I want to grab the speakers and shake him loose! But I have no complaints about his guitar playing, or the playing of any of the other musicians on here. These guys cook and smoke, playing the blues with heart and soul. The choice of material is a bit predictable, and not all of it is amazing (their cover of \\"Trouble No More,\\" for example, isn't nearly as powerful as the classic version by the Allman Brothers), but this is still an enjoyable set and the band sounds like they are having fun, which helps make any live session more memorable.
B00D6GT5S8|5.0|Besides the courteous free album stream from Amazon, (which, was not much of an uplifting listening experience due to my unpredictable internet connection), I listened to this record for the first time, all the way through, without interruption just a few hours ago.<br /><br />First of all, I want to say that I am really digging the variety that's coming from these guys recently. When I say 'recently' I mean their material after Takk... which is an album that has proven to be a fan favorite, housing some of the band's most successful stand-alone songs. Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust was released after that album, then Valtari, which was a letdown for some people due to it's severe lack of action, (I personally loved that album, but it received significant criticism among fans and critics alike), then, we get  KVEIKUR<br /><br />This record indeed sees the band taking on a really heavy approach to their glorious art-rock/ambient tendencies that we've all grown to love. This record is especially a treat after Valtari. Now let me say... VALTARI and KVEIKUR are polar opposites. That is a point that I seriously think most will agree with me on. While VALTARI demonstrated the group's ability to create beautifully smooth and plain heavenly soundscapes, KVEIKUR demonstrates their ability to deliver powerful, lurching, sinister but also uplifting songs that will leave you in an apocalyptic trance.<br /><br />I will say, I was expecting more darker songs on this record. Brennisteinn and Kveikur are really the only songs that are significantly dark for the band. This is only a slight complaint though, for the band still delivers with more hopeful and uplifting tracks while keeping the heavy and lurching tendencies of Brennisteinn and Kveikur.<br /><br />Overall, this album really impresses me, not only for the songs themselves that are housed in this record, but for the brilliant new direction that keeps the band delivering a steady flow of variety to their recent releases which will give a light of hope to fans of Takk... who began to lose interest with the band.<br /><br />KVEIKUR IS ALMIGHTY GOOD. LISTEN AND BE AMAZED.
0062218867|3.0|This isn't the same. The style is different, the characters are strangely different from their former selves, and the subject matter has aspects which I've never seen from Terry Pratchett. I had difficulty getting through parts of it, resorting to skimming through passages. That's NEVER come up as I read other Discworlds. It gets better as it goes along and it's a good book, all in all. Thing is, everything else I've read by Pratchett was invariably excellent to sheer genius.<br />I recently read Dodger and it was also different but still an excellent read and an engaging story. I defended Pratchett in my Dodger review against the same sort of criticisms seen here. But Dodger is about subjects for which Pratchett has had a lot of passion since he was a young man and isn't Discworld.<br />I had the same problems with this one as some of the other reviewers: the toilet humor, the body excretion stuff, the changes in style, the Americanisms. And I fear that we may not be seeing more Discworld novels.<br />Would I still recommend Snuff? Yes, but not for those new to Sir Terry Pratchett and Discworld.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a lovely little game!  It keeps me busy for hours, you don't have to wait for more energy to continue, fantastic!

B003KRJNBW|1.0|Tons of violence against woman presented in a way that makes it seem as if it's the norm, the natural state of humanity.<br /><br />We just wanted to have a post-apocalyptic marathon and thought this movie might work.<br /><br />For the most part all we could notice was how horrible the depictions of women were and how much superfluous rape there was. We stopped watching after Mila Kunis was rescued and jumped gratefully into Denzel Washington's arms.<br /><br />This portrayal of women is pretty unacceptable considering the movie was made in 2010. I mean really, I thought we were leaps and bounds ahead of this \\"damsel in distress\\" stereotype, the idea that men are monsters who can't control themselves, and the notion of women being used for barter. What the hell?<br /><br />The most frustrating thing is that some might think: \\"This is a 'realistic' portrayal of what would actually happen in a post-apocalyptic world.\\" Because it's so realistic for a blind 50 year old man to be able to take down 10 twenty-something guys single-handedly, right? I just think it's messed up and really lazy for people to continue to exploit rape for entertainment purposes, in this day and age. Do better, Hollywood.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm now obsessed with this series! Norman Reedus is my favorite actor on the show!!! Can't wait for the new season to start in October!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I love this game in the same way I love quiet moments and meditation.  As much as I love the \\"pew pew pew\\" of 1st shooter games and the hack and slash of many of my favorite RPG's, I love Journey as an escape to a peaceful solitude into a beautiful, serene world that I have no need or real desire to power game through.  I love that you can go through this alone or join in with many of the people you meet along the way and experience the benefits of cooperative play.  I love the slow, unraveling mystery, the vast deserts filled with it's many ruins and the deep sea caverns and throughout, the cryptic back story.  The narrative remains up for interpretation through its conclusion and is likely to frustrate those looking for more concrete answers. The real story is about the places you visit as you travel and the sense of isolation the game evokes as you go.  I love the subtle, yet powerful metaphor that this game brings forth.  If we work together, we're able to handle difficult situations with calmness and ease.  If you're out for complex battle strategy, intricate puzzles, or branching upgrade systems, this game isn't for you.  If you're open to that often nebulous realm of how a game might elicit emotion and the artistic potential of interactive narrative, then I would recommend it in a heartbeat.  As someone who, on a regular basis, wouldn't play a game like this...I'm glad I was in such a mood to try it.  Now it is my \\"hectic, bad-day, go-to peace of mind, body and soul\\" that in this day and age, can be just what we need.
B005HV6Y84|2.0|I only got the entire cd for one song.  Not really a big fan of any other sons on there. :(
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I really have not played this game because I can't get my kids off of it to get my turn lol. They just love it and have a great time with it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is cool.....but it has a really bad creativity with the nether and why not add cats and wolves and slimes and don't let you go to the ender world and why not add endermen and why not have bosses like the ender Dragon don't don't buy this game buy block launcher pro. It is the same thing but you could have skins and texture packs!

B000XUBFE2|4.0|I really liked the author's character development and the way they each had so many stories to tell.  When the subject matter is so difficult the reader needs characters to relate to and empathize with - these were those types of characters.

B000002IR7|5.0|I was 14 when this album was released in the Fall of 1962, and it was not only the title song that grabbed my attention. The music on every track was incredibly compelling because most of what was considered 'rock' back in that era was pretty sentimental, pop-oriented stuff. This soulful, exciting music had crossed over from R&B into the mainstream.<br /><br />At the time of this review there are no sound samples on this CD product page to reinforce what I am saying. However, there are on the MP3 version at [[ASIN:B008JVYYNG Green Onions [Stax Remasters]]]. Give those a listen. Then compare these tracks to any other songs that made it into the Billboard Top 100 for 1962. The title song, Green Onions peaked at #3, but ranked at 53, with Sam Cooke's Having a Party and Ray Charles' You Don't Know Me as ranking neighbors. While Cooke and Charles were icons in their own right their songs sound positively sedate compared to most of them on this album. And if you look at some of the others that charted in 1962 you will truly see (or hear) what I mean because Burl Ives, Henry Mancini and The Four Seasons also charted close to Green Onions. Ironically, Acker Bilk's Stranger on the Shore that is covered on this album charted Number 1 on the Billboard Top 100 for Bilk in 1962.<br /><br />While this is Booker T and the MGs' inaugural album it is also the first that Stax released independently of Atlantic Records. More importantly, this is the personnel does NOT include Donald Duck Dunn on bass. He would  not join the group until 1965 when he replaced bassist Lewie Steinberg (who is on double bass on this album.) Dunn is on the two live bonus tracks on this album.<br /><br />The album was recorded in June through August, 1962 and released in October of that year. Booker T. Jones is on organ (but also credited with some guitar, bass and other keyboard work), Steve Cropper is on guitar, backed by Lewie Steinberg on double bass and the great Al Jackson jr. on drums.<br /><br />This music may sound tame by today's standards, but was not only ground breaking when released, it was also influential too.music may sound tame by today's standards, but was not only ground breaking when released, it was also influential too.
B00BPA6XUK|4.0|Great addition to any soundtrack buffs. The suspense and trills of the movie packed in this soundtrack, also great deal. I wish it had auto rip.
0399165274|2.0|Frederick Forsyth is the best thriller novelist I've ever read.  I couldn't put down \\"The Odessa File\\", \\"Day Of The Jackal\\", \\"The Avenger\\" or many other of his books.  It took me four days to read this and I wasn't impressed.<br />A Muslim extremist is recruiting followers utilizing the web, in a secure fashion so no one knows where to find him.  While disguising his voice, and hiding his face, he is encouraging young men to seek out local public officials and kill them, then kill themselves, or let the cops take them down.  These men will be awarded the typical prize martyrs are granted in heaven.  When \\"The Tracker's\\" father is killed, his mission to find the leader is intensified.  Unlike \\"The Odessa File\\", which is also an intensely personal story about a Nazi hunter and his father's tormentor, there is no brilliant scene between The Tracker and his quest.  It is entirely too formulaic.

B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought this cd for my 9 yo son and he absolutely loves it. He listens to it all the time. He wanted it because he loved radioactive, but ended up falling in love the rest of the songs on there more...
B000003N7K|5.0|While &#34;Lush Life&#34; is not among my favorite songs, it is well done. Hartman's renditions of &#34;Dedicated to You&#34; and  &#34;You Are Too Beautiful&#34; are simply exquisite. Coltrane's accompanying improvs are delightful. An extraordinarily fine album.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|but short. Finished all five worlds in two days. Then it wants you to purchase expansion. Should have more worlds front the start. Should have at least ten worlds before expansion. Also could use more items.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|the music, the story, the actors---just a nice warm fuzzy movie about family, relationships, great photography and the dialogue is outstanding

B0030V0PEW|4.0|Overall great read with powerful insight into the art and science of medicine. Highlights the reality of the urgent need for improvement in today's delivery of healthcare.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|Though I don't normally for this kind of novel I am very glad that I read it. I don't imagine that it's east to create a villain whom you start out hating and end up feeling nothing more than pity for, Nicholas Sparks has done just that. If you are thinking of reading this book then I would most definitely recommend that you do =0)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I waited to finish this series.WHat a fine finish.as always Collins can hold a reads attention and she did this again but she also are a nice ending. Looking forward to more of her books in the future.<br /><br />Zanne46@gmail
B00CATSONE|4.0|It's more about genius and innovation:about half is on Tesla. Easy to read and enjoyable but don't expect an in depth biography on Tesla.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great way to relax and spend time using your brain. also nice to have so many puzzles without taking up space or worrying about losing the pieces.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|That honor goes to Number 3. This book was a great way to continue all the lives of the characters left out of Number 4. It was more supernatural and even continued after the final events of the last book. I'm looking forward to the next book.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is a good read and hard to put down. Reacher is our new hero in print. Some of his adventures seem a bit contrived but it is fun to watch this bigger than life character win against the bad guys. I have become a Reacher fan and you will too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When I go grocery shopping, it easy to see. It keeps a running tab on what I have spent. Now no more juggling a small calculator and my grocery list. Thanks. The best part it was free.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Good movie, but a bit hole-y, the actors are great and the climax leading up to Kevins tragedy was good and suprising!
1451695195|1.0|We had heard another scientist who is researching life after death experiences for many people. This fellow had an interesting experience but I don't need to be convinced of an after life by a surgeon.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Really?  I didn't know this was a Disney film when I rented it, I won't make that mistake again. Disney would be my last choice to make a sequel to a film as good as The Wizard of Oz... Disney has produced a film for children pulling liberally from their catalog of boring talking animals in an attempt to hold the viewers focus while the story itself sinks into nothingness. The colors were nice and the acting poor. If you dislike the formulaic insults that are Disney movies stay away but if you like Disney by all means see this movie.
0375842209|5.0|Finally. I found another book worthy of more than a thousand praises. Words alone are not enough to describe the beauty of this book.<br /><br />This is definitely tied with Norwegian Wood to first place, bagging the most favorite book ever title.<br /><br />Everything was beautiful.. faultless. I cried at the ending.<br /><br />I despise you Hitler.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I own the Nexus 4 and this is so amazing that it blows my mind and those I've shown it too. It plays videos awesome in 1080p and the audio is as good as you would expect from HDMI and then to play real games on my 55 inch tv ia amazing, no glitches or hiccups! I've had phones with MHL and the technology is not even close. Slimport is Display Port but mini. Awesome product!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good version of Solitaire. Installs and runs on Kindle Fire with no problems.  Only complaint is that it automatically turns over top card on the pile, which I prefer to do myself.  If you don't like ads, then buy a different version. The ads are what makes it free. A small price to pay.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Fantastic reading.  Not getting enough sleep because I can't put it down at night.  My wife was looking over my shoulder as I was reading but I was clicking the Kindle to fast for her.
1933784105|5.0|This is an enormous tome, each book is signed and numbered by Lorne Peterson.<br /><br />The Special Edition contains many many more photos - 500 hundred more i believe, a very well specially produced Documentary Diary  DVD narrated by Lorne Peterson, multiple solid resin reproduction props as used in the production of Star Wars - A New Hope, and an additional thinner paperback book focusing on the CG elements of the later films.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, some of the images suffer from low resolution, tho not many. Fans would have been better served with more emphasis placed on the creatures created for the films, the index at the rear of the book with 1/2\\" x 1/2\\" images is more comprehensive, tho disappointing at the very small scale. Fortunately the included DVD does a great job of showcasing the creatures and the shenanigans in the studio.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00CRMX53S|3.0|Most of the songs do not match the &#34;quality&#34; of the hit &#34;Get Lucky&#34;. It really surprised me. Try the preview first
B008OM0EDO|2.0|Cohens comedy is hopeless ........what a beautiful trainwreck, I'm just glad I wasn't one of the investors in this mess.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I've downloaded a few videos and so far seems very good. My antivirus did not classify it as malware (I use AVG antivirus)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|There are close to 4000 reviews for this book right now on Amazon and nearly 25,000 reviews on Goodreads.  What I have to say probably won't matter much and so I will keep it short and sweet. My husband caught a couple of episodes one night while he was at a neighbor's house. The next day he was ordering HBO so we could start the series.  The interesting twist to this is that I am the reader in this family; I love the fantasy and paranormal genres.  Me, not husband!  But husband found the show, which I adored.  So of course I had to order the books right away.  I devoured this first book despite it's size and I loved every minute of it.  Yes, the book is better than the tv show but they show is a very faithful adaption.  I know that it becomes less so as the series progresses and the characters are storylines become too many to control in one tv series.  There is nothing to dislike about this book.  Even though Martin sure doesn't mind killing the main characters, that is actual a benefit to me.  As an author, he is surprising, shocking and thrilling me again!  I read so very many books that this is so refreshing to me.  I love certain characters (Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, Arya, Brandon, TYRION) and I despise certain characters (Joffrey, Cersai, Stannis, Catelyn) and then there are characters I am probably supposed to hate but still care for (Jaimie, Theon). Each character is just written perfectly.  Yes it took me some time to get some of them straightened out in my head but now I can't learn enough of them or their backstories.  I find myself forming theories about where Martin will take the series. I am praying that Martin will wrap this story up before either he or I die!  I must know what happens in this world.  I care! And that is such a great thing for an author to accomplish: to make a reader care.  If you hesitate to read these books, don't! At least give the first one a try and decide from there.  I couldn't have been more pleased.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|The game is fun but  I feel like you need to have more control so you don't fall over 24 7
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Would rent again. A+++++++++!!!!!!!!<br /><br />This is one of the better movies I've seen in a long time. Cruise delivers an exceptional performance that compliments the well-written script and intense storyline.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|At first I was happy because finally would be able to take Video, bit yesterday that I have an important  event it didn't work out. Just a damn Window message \\"the camera stop working\\". And how the heck Am I going to make it work? I paid for a service a  that I can't use.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Absolutely loved this third book. I can't wait for the 4th now! Great story with amazing character detail. I can't wait to see what happens next!
B009UNGYHG|4.0|As with many of the other reviewers, I think this is a good case for someone who wants to have a headset available but isn't the type that likes to be wearing the headset all the time. My problem had been just tossing the headset in my gadget pouch or into my bag and it getting damaged. This case is small enough that it doesn't add that much extra bulk but provides reasonable protection for the headset.<br /><br />This also makes up for the fact that the plantronics headset has a goofy mag charge and keeps you from losing that charging cable.<br /><br />A nice feature would be to have a usb plug on the case - a short USB plug that is coiled in the bottom of the case so that you don't even need to carry around the additional USB cord.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|This is fun in a boring way. It's ok for the first couple of times you play, but then it's like &quot; this again&quot;. It's blow the hair, pick the hair color, pick the hat. It's really not that great. But for some of you it might be. I hope you have better luck then I do.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|I was very much looking forward to seeing this film, but ultimately found it to be a somewhat average and mildly entertaining work.  There was nothing particularly special about it.  And, unfortunately, all the better scenes are in the two-minute trailer, so there's nothing really surprising about it.  The storyline dealt more with investigating the medical/biological source of the \\"zombie\\" affliction than the zombies themselves.  The zombies, in fact, felt like a plot device to drive the investigative angle of the story - nothing more.  For that reason, I found the film a bit disappointing and would not be interested in seeing it again.  I'm not even sure that I would be all that excited about a sequel, which is 100 per cent certainty.  Overall, I'd call this a tepid entertainment.  You won't want your money back, but you may wonder if it was well spent.
B000B5MI3Q|1.0|These watch is not accurate, it runs very fast and they are all the same, finally SEIKO is going solar like CITIZEN did a long time ago, they are making a lot of solar models, i wish they could make this same model with solar power. Forget about automatics, they are in the past, only crazy collectors buy them.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Just started the game and I, also, thought the first few levels were extremely easy. That has since changed. Prior to purchasing it, I had originally read something about finding \\"jewels\\". Well, after several levels, I finally found one by accident. Then, I read that there is a \\"jewel\\" to find on every level. I don't even know how I found the one I did. (do I ever feel stupid) Can someone tell me how to find these little devils? And now I hear that not only are there hidden/secret levels, but hidden \\"time pieces\\" on these levels. I have seen what I assume are \\"time pieces\\", but have no idea what to do with them. I loved the first two Quells, as I'm sure I will this one when I figure it out. I'm embarrassed to say \\"I need a guide\\".  Does anyone know where I can find out at least what I'm supposed to be looking for? I'm not looking for the  solutions....just a little guidance. HELP, anyone!
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|What more can be said!  As always a good performance by Tom Selleck.  The whole series of the Jesse Stone movies are enjoyable.
0691152640|4.0|Consistent and solid review of historical economic defaults. Independent analysis based on records collected out of wide range of sources. Entertaining
B009AMAGQM|3.0|The books were a lot better. I wished they had kept to the original storyline, instead of trying to cram all four books into one movie. It would have been better.
0142405809|5.0|Our son (33 months old) absolutely loves this book. It is his favourite and he wants it read to him every single night. The prose rhymes like the Gruffalo stories (which he also loves), the artwork is super cute and the story is fun. He has learnt a lot of vocab with this book and joins in with telling the story.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|First off thx Amazon for timely delivery & quality. This DVD is one of the best metal concerts you could own. The usual classics are here but you'll also find some deep cuts such as Never Satisfied. The sound & video are pristine. This is a truly remarkable concert that any metal head would love to own.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful author, and from his three novels, I have learned practically all I know about Afghanistan.  His first two books, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were spell-binding - I couldn't put them down.  He drew me into a world very foreign to me, and I have felt so much richer for having read them.  I read this third book eagerly, and will continue to read every book he publishes, but I found this one difficult to read.  The story spans several generations, and at times both the time and the characters lacked enough definition and development to be clear to the reader.  The book would have been easier to understand if there were an appendix with the names of the characters and the family lineage, and also one with an explanation of the uncommon foreign words.  The story lacks cohesiveness - at the outset, the small family suffering in poverty immediately evokes sympathy, but the story wanders loosely around this family instead of focusing on it which is where the heart of the story really is.  Nevertheless, the author asks his readers, many of whom have surely never been to Afghanistan, to open their eyes and see the land and its people he knows so well.  As much as I wish he had done some things differently with And the Mountains Echoed, I still read it with great interest and appreciation.
B008K93302|5.0|I rated this product high because I have a great deal of use for it. It is going to beneficial for my needs. Thanks
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This really is a cute and fun game. I downloaded it for my nephew but I've been the only one playing it. Doesn't take long for you to collect coins to expand your land or to make your family's bigger either.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|PURE HORROR. AMAZINGLY DONE. AMAZING ACTING, BEAUTIFUL VIOLENCE, GRUESOME FUN. A TOTAL BLAST. VERY VERY WELL DONE. DEFINATELY A MUST SEE.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this simple but very nice puzzle solving game.  It was not so difficult that it could not be solved with a little thought.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|this is the best final destination movie so far. loved it. gruesome fun. amazing acting. you'll love it. very good
0142420891|5.0|More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ http://littlepiecesofimagination.blogspot.com/<br /><br />Actual rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />I absolutely adored the amazingness that was If I Stay.  I wanted to read Where She Went so bad. I must admit that the first chapter that was at the end of the first book completely knocked me down from my amazement pedestal since it wasn't at all what I expected. After finishing the second installment, I felt happy enough to dance around in my room and smile like a crazy person though.<br /><br />QUOTE<br />\\"You were so busy trying to be my savior that you left me all alone.\\"<br /><br />Where She Went takes place three years after the events of If I Stay and it's safe to say that things are not at all what we expect them to be. Adam and Mia are both doing their own thing and it's hard to see how much Adam has changed after what happened in the previous book. He is moody, full of grunge and hate. Full of sorrow.<br /><br />If I Stay was so full of tears and emotions for me whereas Where She Went explored a different type of emotions - anger, hate, pain. The writing is very relatable and easy to follow, but beautiful at the same time. Forman delivered Adam's feelings effortlessly and the way she entwines the past and the present is done very well. The scenes of the past where Adam spent time with Mia's family and baby brother were done beautifully. I am so terribly sad that the opportunity to do that again in the future has been torn away from Mia and Adam. Overall, I love Gayle Forman's writing a bunch!<br /><br />I kinda lost all hope for the happily-ever-after I was hoping for, but when I least expected it, Forman delivered it to me with a beautiful colorful ribbon on top of it (read: everything following the kiss). I don't have enough great words to explain to you how much I loved these two novels and how much I hope you'll pick it up and pet these books with the same kind of adoration as I did. I've said it before and I'll say it again - I'm a tool for not picking these up before, my loss! Better late than never. Get on `em, lovelies!<br /><br />PS. I gave it 4.5 because for me If I Stay was more emotional. I had to wait for two weeks in order to receive my paperback of Where She Went and throughout that time I read a few other books so my mind had recovered from that horrible ugly crying. If I had read it right after finishing the first installment, I am sure, I would have loved it even more than the first one. Nevertheless, it doesn't take away from the beauty of Mia and Adam and their tragic yet gorgeous story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We do not get AMC, so I made the choice to purchase Walking Dead series. It was awesome and I got to watch the shows at my convenience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game i ever played in my life.  I can not believe that my brother called this game boring.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app is awesome.I loved the first temple run but I like this one even better... you should definitely get it
B005K0HDGE|5.0|First of all, I must say that I have been looking forward to reading this novel since I first found out about it. I love anything on JFK and I also am crazy about time travel stories... so this book was perfect for me. I have a rule about not paying more than $9.99 for a kindle book and with other things to read it did take me a long time before I read this novel but I am glad I did.<br /><br />The strength of this novel for me was the characters. Jake or George depending on what time period we are talking about, was an excellent character who was complicated but was very realistic and easy to relate to. Also Sadie (the love interest) and all the characters from the 50's and 60's are really well written and vital to the story. One tidbit about the novel is that even though the story is about stopping the assassination of JFK most of it centers around the main character and his experiences in the past before he gets to November 22, 1963. The time portal that he goes through takes him to 1958 so he has a lot of experiences before he gets to that day in Dallas. He has several wrongs that he wants to make right and of course he meets Sadie and their relationship and the back story is almost enough to be a novel by itself. Keep in mind that this novel is extremely long and while I had no problem with the pacing, other than a little more than half way through with following Oswald, I can certainly say that it is a very detailed. For me it is always a committment to read a novel of this length and it may be for some other readers too.<br /><br />After I finish a novel I usually go back and read some reviews both positive and negative about the novel I just finished. While I love the novel I will say there are some excellent points made by people that didn't like the novel. If you go into it trying to poke holes in the story or if you are a reader that does that automatically then I think it is safe to say you will find issues with this novel. It is a fun ride and I didn'treally think about the few shortcomings until after I finished the novel due to be so engrossed with the characters and the story.<br /><br />My opinion of the novel is that it is a real page turner and I believe most of you out there will like it too.<br /><br />Grade: A
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Such great books on here to read, and I don't even read that much, that is until I got this app.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Frustrated that it will not let me do whatever update is available right now. Have tried multiple times, logged out of fb, restarted my phone. It keeps saying an error occurred during installation. How can I fix this? In general, most of the time I really like this app.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is soooo fun and is definitely addicting. My nieces absolutely love this game and they are five so get it.
0807208523|5.0|E.B. White reading his own masterpiece brings the story to life like no reading I've heard before.  No matter how well you know it you'll appreciate it even more upon listening to his reading.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I LOVE music so this is a great app to have! Especially because I listen to music everyday of my life.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I found the story line a bit :over the top&#34; but I still like it.  Julianne was good and is always nice to look at.
B005R32L66|4.0|This is a cool app because you can communicate with people mile and miles away from you. I love it
B004UID2LC|5.0|It's youtube, I mean what can you say.? It works and it's free. Free is good! Nothing is different from the one you use on everything else.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have 3 updates but it needs more. In creative mode it needs all of the computer stuff. It doesn't have everything.
B006JPML7K|5.0|My kids loved this movie and we would buy it again. It is worth the money and keeps kids busy while on errands..
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie Underwood draws you into her music .. The song Blown Away, you clearly understand the message of why this young girl wants the house gone. I listen to Carrie on repeat. The Two Black Cadillacs - love this song. Perhaps the secret revenge.. :-) Truly a winning album.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|This app would be good for a two year old not a preschool child. It was very boring for my child and too easy...
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I've seen Josh Groban in concert and he is a natural, both his voice and his ease of performance. Each Album is a must purchase for me.. His music isn't erratic, frantic or harried.. The smooth voice and melody can be listened too anywhere.<br /><br />I have followed this amazing talent for years and love his music and voice.<br /><br />Thanks Josh.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This has so many sounds to choose from and it plays till you fall asleep. If  you have trouble getting to sleep this app is for you..
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly worked very well until all other versions (Google Play, iOS, desktop...) updated to version 16 and now sync with Feedly Cloud instead of Google Reader. This version got left behind and still syncs to Google Reader. This app is worthless until it is also updated to sync with Feedly Cloud.<br /><br />[EDIT] App is updated and all is well with the world again. Four stars instead of five, because one of the sharing buttons is white on a white background, and invisible. Fix that and I'll give it five stars.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't put this book down and now I HAVE to read the third book! I loved it! I recommend this to anyone who can handle violence and suspense.
1781162646|5.0|Never a bad story from King but fun read if you are a fan.  My husband is a constant reader
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The first few rooms are very easy. Once you know what to look for the other rooms take a little longer, but aren't much of a challenge, just wish there were moor floors.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Jennifer is rising fast in multi-character roles. In hunger games she is like a child forced to group up where in this she plays a already harden young women very well.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I thought this app would be great and it was finnaly one that i would love it worked for abot 20 minutes and suddenly stopped working so i had to delete it
B00B7Y0206|1.0|the dumbest youtube app ever. when I wanted to download it it wouldnt let me. stupidest app ever!!!!! I don't recommend this app at all. trust the bad comments. don't get it!
B006C67NP6|5.0|Like most of you, I am busy and reading big user manual is a big turn off. I want to practice new scales, etc. with something more than a metronome and be able to switch tonality fast, etc. Band in a Box is overkill that with its too numerous features + it's pricey. This app does just what I need (and a bit more) and more importantly I could figure out what it did within about 10-15 minutes. I hope those guys put their thinking cap one more time and come up with another killer app.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It is amazing that after all the Ryan books, Clancy is still a must read.  I find the way he melds real-day issues with his fictional characters refreshing and maintains my interest throughout the read.  Great book!
0452295548|5.0|I love it, it was inspiring and amazing, still human is unknown creature.  I do recommend the book to all.
B008K8U13K|4.0|Mostly just a remake of the best classic sonic although it has homing and the strange minecart level is pretty fun
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Unbelievable. I never would have thought of destroying 99 kids a year every year. Its not even fathomable. King wrote this in a way that you get to know the characters, their lives, and their fears. Why they volunteered and their hopes and dreams. Only King could have written this horror and turned it into something heroic and almost wonderful at the same time. If you haven't read The Long Walk then you have no idea who the man is. Brilliant, that who he is.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|good game fun to play I  like games that works your brain want more games like this one that you can play with out being on the Internet can not stop playing
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I like the way the stories pick up, leave off and ultimately weave together. It was an amazing read with unique perspective.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The book was a fair sci-fy story, but not one that I will remember for too long.  The heroine was just too perfect in whatever she did.  I will not read the follow ups.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I like that all characters are well thought through and a have different point of view. It is a fast paced book and although I figured out the plot before it was revealed in the book, it was still interesting how it was told.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|I enjoyed the history it contained.  However, He stopped before I anticipated he would.  Expected more dialogue.  I also did not expect that about half the book would be footnotes, bibliography etc.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|We love Volbeat, and they haven't failed to impress with this newest release!  Amazon was a great place to make this purchase!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and not too challenging. Great game to pass time when riding in car or waiting for an appointment!!!
0425263924|4.0|\\"Day One of my life was the day I met you.\\"<br /><br />So much drama goes down in Entwined With You! I was gripped by this book right from the beginning.<br /><br />First of all...holy crap... the nightclub sex scene. It was so real, I felt like I was there. And it was incredibly hot. Incredibly. It was one of the most amazing and sexually intense things that I've ever read... until I got to the airplane scene. Jesus Christ. I've never read a book that went into that territory, and I was surprised and pleased at how tastefully it was done.<br /><br />While I really want to absolutely love these books, there is something lacking in the relationship part of the story for me. I just don't get Eva and Gideon's relationship. I want them to overcome their problems, but one thing after another gets thrown at them, and I never get to a place where I feel comfortable with them being together. There are times when I'm hopeful, but in the back of my mind I'm always nervous and waiting for the next thing that's coming around the corner to screw it all up. This type of storyline creates drama and excitement, but I'm just not totally convinced about the two of them being able to work. It's three books later and they're still dealing with the same constant drama and relationship problems that are always threatening to break them up for good. And they've only been dating for such a short time! How can a relationship like that work? I'd like to think that it can, but I just don't wholeheartedly believe in their relationship, and that makes me sad.<br /><br />I think that a lot of my skepticism about their relationship has to do with Eva and Gideon's totally different personalities. Specifically Gideon's alpha-male tendencies. I was a little bit put off by his domineering side in this book...more so than the others (and more so than other \\"alpha male\\"-type books). There is a specific event that happens ((view spoiler)) that kind of upset me. It just seemed like he was being agressive for no reason, and even though Eva stated multiple times that she didn't agree with him (even their therapist didn't agree!), she eventually went along with what he wanted. I'm all for dominate/submissive sex scenes, and I'm actually pretty traditional when it comes to roles in a relationship, but I just thought that, in this circumstance, he really crossed a line (no pun intended!).<br /><br />That being said, I did enjoy this book a lot. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to see where their story will go next. I love Eva's character. I've really been able to relate to her throughout the series and can see why she is so attracted to Gideon and why she does the things that she does. It's Gideon that I can't really wrap my brain around -- I just don't totally see where he's coming from. I like Eva's relationships with her friends and family, and we got to see them all grow a lot in this third book. And, of course, we can't forget Sylvia Day's incredible talent to write the absolute perfect and most drool-worthy sex scenes.for no reason, and even though Eva stated multiple times that she didn't agree with him (even their therapist didn't agree!), she eventually went along with what he wanted.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good until the very last word. Kept it interesting and didn't want to put it down! A must read if you like suspense.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is a movie about a man who is an evil inventor whose life is changed by three little girls.  It is great to watch.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am now in the process of reading everything with Sylvia Day.  This series is exceptional and I truly love Eva and Gideon's story.  Great characters and smokin' chemistry also.<br />If you like these types of reads I would recommend anything Sylvia is writing and especially this series.  Could not put it down and really looking forward to the continuing saga of these characters.
B000OVLBEY|5.0|This is a movie about a man that gets in over his head with the devil when he tries to saves his daddy.  But he uses his curse to get back at the devil for tricking him.
1781162646|5.0|I'm a Stephen King novice, having only read a handful of his books, but I have to say that this one had, relatively, the best ending of any of them. Under the Dome (my personal favorite) had a terrible ending, and I had figured that King just couldn't end a story right, but Joyland is an exception to the rule. To not spoil anything, the book is gripping, inviting, and overall compelling, enough for me to read it nonstop when the chance presented itself.<br />Buy it, borrow it, do what you need to to get your hand on this book- it will be well worth it.
B00004TFK3|5.0|This is about an organization that doesn't exist and the way that they deal with the aliens that come to this planet.  It is very enjoyable.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|This is another great book Michael Connelly. Again, so many unexpected twists and turns, you never no what' s next. Loved it, and look forward to the next one
B00006JK1R|5.0|This is a continuation of Men in Black.  It is just as enjoyable as the first and you will enjoy it all the way through.
B00BY8DIT2|2.0|This is in my opinion purely Beth Hart CD. There are only few songs where you can here the guitarwork of Mr. Bonamassa. I am disappointed.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie about a family of penguins and one small penguin that is different.  The rest of the penguins can sing beautifully.  But he can only keep the beat of the song with his feet.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this app to play if I am bored. It gave me an easy experience because I didn't know how to play solitare. I get better and better at it every time I play. I rate this a five star app because everyone can play and enjoy it for easy, mobile fun.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|This is a film for the whole family  who loves animals to see.  It is one the whole family will enjoy many times.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I loved everything about this season!  I had heard about the show through other people and finally found the time to watch.  The acting is superb!
6305308659|5.0|This is a movie about a half normal town.  Weird things start to happen in this town when people do different things.
B00A18KCSQ|4.0|Sounds pretty good right now, should be interesting to see if this holds up over time.<br />Seems like there are two very different bands performing songs on this album, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br />The next album will tell the tale of which direction they ultimately chose. Better than most of the dross out currently.
B000BJ7BCA|5.0|This is a movie about kids who have different abilities who goes to high school together and discover they can help the school.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|There's not too much to say, except this RD game has been a favorite online game for me.  The graphics might be a little lacking but the voices, music, and game play make this one a winner in my book!
B00821PCJS|4.0|I love this show. Season one is a little slow at first but getting to know the characters and how they interact makes it all worth it.<br /><br />Season 2 is amazing. I hope this show is around for a long time.
0062255657|5.0|those are the descriptive words that linger in my mind as I think of how I would describe this new work by Gaiman.  As a fan of his work, you will recognize his beautiful prose, his ease of taking you into something your mind tells you can't exist, but that his determination and ability convince you that it can.  I won't spoil the experience with a plot summary, as I read this book without the smallest idea of what it was about and enjoyed it completely.<br /><br />It is short, less than 200 pages, and when I first opened the box from Amazon that was my first thought.  You can easily read it in a sitting and most likely will.  It did leave me feeling hopeful, a little sad but very curious because he opens so many different avenues in this book and takes you back to what it is like to be a child, and to know, you're still a child and everything you are experiencing isn't quite as it would be otherwise.  That, I think, is the real beauty of the book and what makes it lasting.<br /><br />I wanted to read it again.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|Good movie. Great for when you want to see something that's different and entertaining.<br /><br />I wish they would make another movie :(
0800141660|5.0|Another great Jane Austen brought to life!  Tears and laughter, with Willoughby, etc.  this movie is so good, one of my favorites right up there with Pride and Prejudice, recommend to anybody who is a Jane Austen fan!
B001NAT05W|3.0|This movie is alright. Not as bad as you would think with all the negative reviews. The actors are great but the story lacks any excitement.
B003U2QHB6|5.0|Mad because my children didn't know some of the lines I was quoting from Bill and Ted's, I made my 13 year old daughter and 15 year old son watch both Excellent Adventure and Bogus Journey. The movies are still great after all these years and my kids loved the movies.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland more than lived up to expectation. This &#34;crime novel&#34; is a story that is every bit as charming as The Green Mile, or Shawshank Redemption, but not nearly as gruesome. There are some very touching moments, a couple of which brought this reviewer to the brink of tears. Joyland is about a young boy's coming of age. He starts out in a relationship that is doomed because his girlfriend does not share the same feelings for him as he does for her. He leaves school for a year to work for an amusement park where his life really begins. He learns &#34;carney talk.&#34; Wears the &#34;fur.&#34; The unsolved murder serves as one of the vehicles that help develop the relationships between some of the key elements in the story and the young boy discovers feelings he didn't know he had. Unique King. Excellent yarn.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|This book ties up all the threads of his wonderful series. Will miss the weird world of miss Stackhouse and look forward this authors next project.
B000Z66RSS|4.0|the soundtrack is alright it has the full versions of everything you see on the movie unfortunately it's a little over powering for my taste however we watch the movie a lot
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love that I don't need to be right beside the outlet. I can put my kindle up and away from the cats!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Amazing book couldn't put it down. It's keeps u wonder what else is coming. Great author can't wait for next book.
B004GYY714|5.0|We can only get 3 radio stations at work. Now I can listen to my favorite station all day! Yay!
B00D2K40WY|4.0|Hi I'm 9 years old and I would like to thank the creaters of this game. I Love the details, the backround,and the princess's. Thankyou to all the creaters of this game.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it worked ok for a while then it started to lag. iwould send a message and it wont update itself. then I tried uninstalling it but now I can't even open the appliccation because it keeps crashing.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game! It is so addicting. I will give this game 5 stars. The only thing that I wish is that you could walk around and control the iron man. But any way it is awesome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I liked it....but....just kidding...it is addicting.....I want 2 play more levels....that's all....BYE!  Hi, bye, hi, bye, hi, bye, hi, BYE!
B00B2LPYNE|4.0|Very similar to their other albums, and every bit as good!  I only ranked it 4 stars because it doesn't quite measure up to Perseverance or The Rise of Brutality ... yet!  I anticipate with more listenings, it will grow to that point.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great because you can not only check the hourly forecast but u can see charts and graphs for hi and lo and other things. It also tells u the current weather when you slide down the top notification bar.
B005LAII12|1.0|I kind of expected this to be a nice, funny, family-fun movie to watch.  Turns out it is full of F-bombs and other ugly words.  And not fun at all.  Obnoxious.  If I could I would want to return it for a refund.
B004A8ZWWO|4.0|I thought this was funny and well colored with New York City particulars. Eddie Murphy roars.  Though the film -- the writing, timing, the overall -- lacks the through-line of total brilliance that would up it to five stars.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The music and video are fantastic.  I have been a fan of Jon Schmidt for many years, however, I think the combination of the two instruments is great.
B0078Q2HAA|3.0|I wanted to like this more than I did. Interesting social history, though I don't know how much truth there is in it. And there's an engaging story about aging in there. I found Meryl Streep as Maggie Thatcher unconvincing. And the writing stopped short of giving her the kind of raw materials the story seemed to strive for.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Everything about the game is better.  They tweak the controls ever so slightly so that is becomes easier to handle but not enough that any of the gameplay is changed or less gratifying.  The graphics are amazing and you basically can't buy a better game at this price point considering it's not one but two classic playstation titles.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Great aviation thriller with a dark an gritty human drama that opened the eyes and provoked outrage, sympathy, and questions.  Though farfetched in places.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Perhaps my favorite of his three novels. The stories flow and weave together so seamlessly, it was truly a beautiful piece. I may even begin reading it again.
B009JZPH32|5.0|I confess to being a big fan of Oliver Stone.  and I enjoyed this as a modern-day Stone version of Goodfellas, adapted for 2012. Replete with super cast.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|fun little game. easy to spend an hour on it. easy for kids to play and fun for big kids too.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Very original drama, engaging, and intriguing if farfetched in places... but Mara and Zeta-Jones did not cut it for me. Jude Law was outstanding.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|This movie was a disappointment.  I found it to be miscast and this contributed to the movie's rating.  It could have been much better.  Too bad.
B0013KTGAG|1.0|I stopped watching the movie before I was midway through it because of the swearing. Not entertainment or creativity when you have to use over the top profanity and/or swearing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game for all ages.  You must remember numbers and sequences of colors as well as numbers.  Difficulty level is just right.  You have to work but not too hard.
1416905014|5.0|This is one of many of this author's books that I have purchased for my three grandchildren and they have become a beautiful collection I keep at my house.  The pop-ups are more like engineering masterpieces and always amaze us at their quality. It is hard to beieve that he can sell these for so little with so much time and skill put into them.  My praise to him and I hope he knows how much children love his work and their eyes just light up in enjoyment.  Thank you from this happy grandma!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good idea.  Needs few more hidden item sections and more clues per area but it was fun and kept me entertained
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I just loved this book because it touches on the strength of relationships and the deep love of one's family and friends.  Many tears and smiles along the way.  Another fantastic book from Hosseini!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I really liked this movie. It brings in the premise that the wolf was not an ordinary wolf but a were wolf and threw in one of the many stories about the creatures.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Just like Lucretius argue that all things are made of the same bits of matter, Greenblatt draws out in his well written book the fine connections through time of philosophers attempts to describe the world. Greenblatt has drawn the dance of thought as it swerved through the centuries and made it most memorable.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Even though this is a reverse remake of the one with Sean Connory, it is a great movie. I would recommend it for those who like sci-fi in a sudo historic setting!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun game cant wait for more levels as there are only 10 right now. even my 5 year old likes to play
0345529057|5.0|I saw the first part of the HBO series (wish I could watch it on the Web or Hulu!) These books go into more detail and actually explain what is left out in the show. Am going to get the last book soon.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|When is season 3?  Cumberbatch makes you want to be his Watson, frustration and all.  Love the BBC and their productions.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've seen so many doctors,on various documentaries, state that any NDE is simply the brain shutting down and is creating all these visions and experiences. A few have gone as far as recreating the feelings and visions through electrical stimulation. Dr Alexander had no brain function and still experienced the NDE. Even not being a religious person, Dr Alexander even had succumbed to the ideology that NDE s were scientifically proven to be false. Yet, he experienced everything he had heard from his patients and more. If you lack faith in God or don't believe in life after death. This is a must read. Thank you Dr Eben Alexander.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a good game for kids but you have to be careful because you have to wait constantly or pay in peanuts. You don't get many of those. Colorful and cute though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was an amazing unique perspective. I was moved and horrified and happy and terribly sad while reading this book.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What a pleasure it is to read something by a true &#34;word artist.&#34; I look forward to reading more books by Vanessa Diffenbaugh.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought this sony headphone to replaced an old and broke unit.  Wow... this headphone is awesome... as soon as you put it on, you will notice all the surrounding sound is gone.... acting almost like a canceling headphone that i tried once without paying all the big price.  I have bought sony products all my life... i have rarely gotten disappointed with ANYTHING Sony care to make... folks.. i am a middle age man....lol, this items is NO exception... highly recommended it
B006ISG9XA|5.0|This book is fresh and enjoyable. Thakeray is one of the staples of a well-rounded education. Loved the story and the characters. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! This is one of those that can keep your interest every level. Ready for more - keep 'em coming!
055358894X|1.0|This books felt like reading three books loosely put together with similarly connected characters.<br /><br />1st the pacing was slow while for some books this is not an issue it became and issue for this books because of all of the interruptions to the stories rhythm. You start the story expecting a growing up getting into trouble kind of book and then jump to the characters as adults. This isn't an issue normally but just as the adult story gets going you get thrown back into the back stories for the characters breaking your rhythm and it feels like your starting the story all over again each time.<br /><br />2nd The characters are just not engaging. They have some interesting points but you don't feel much when one of them is killed which says a lot. I have read similar books where a character was killed and felt sad at the characters lose but in this I felt nothing.<br /><br />3rd Where the hell is the plot. I struggled through the first 400 pages trying to figure out what the plot was, who is the antagonist, while you get the protagonist through the title of the book the antagonist isn't even vaguely revealed through foreshadowing leaving you wondering what is conflict here.<br /><br />Finally there is suppose to be a sequel but nothing really sets it up and the character engagement just doesn't bring one to want to pick up another story about these characters. Granted this is all my opinion and everyone is free to try the book but if you enjoy high fantasy or fantasy novels in general I would steer clear because I feel like me you will most likely be disappointed.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I enjoyed this album. That being said, the lyrics can be sort of stupid sometimes &#34;Don't Judge him Joe Brown!&#34;, but it's not like Kanye West records are a spiritual doctrine or anything, so no need to be too serious. That being said, I enjoyed the political messages in songs like &#34;New Slaves&#34; and &#34;Black Skinhead.&#34; Kanye disses corporate control of the population in &#34;New Slaves&#34;, which, even though he talks about his Benz in &#34;Send it Up&#34;, it does make the listener look at the political issues therein. &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34; is another track worth talking about. I'm not sure if I approve of the sentiment behind sampling Nina Simone's &#34;Strange Fruit&#34;, after all it is an American classic with a chilling subject matter. Kanye's song has nothing to do with lynch mobs, but, then something more chilling, similar in vein to Simone's song became apparent. The song deals with the possibility of aborting an illegitimate child. I may be interpreting a bit much here but it seems like an anti-abortion song of sorts. The &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34; could be of mother nature, the fetus's mother, ending the fetus's life. The image of fetuses hanging from a tree by the umbilical cord like the lynched that Simone's song refers to comes to mind. This could also have a more socially conscious meaning too, suggesting that too many African American babies are aborted. It's a good track regardless.<br />As far as the production and the beats go, they can seem a bit rushed at times. Were I Kanye, I'd have waited a few more months to really solidify the beats. As they are, it's very clear that he's been influenced by alternative hip hop groups like Death Grips. I'm not sure he's quite fluent in the art of making these beats. It sounds like a poppier version of Death Grips. I think one of the strongest tracks on the album is similar to his earlier, soul sample work, &#34;Bound 2.&#34; Either way, I like the direction in which he's headed.<br />All in all, I'd recommend the album.
B000YHG72E|5.0|LOVE this movie! It's so quotable (&#34;SANTA?!? I KNOW him! I know him!!&#34; - one of my favs). Definitely a quality Will Ferrell movie. I watch this a couple times during the holidays every year. Probably my favorite Christmas movie.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Mr. Moss brings to light some things we may already know about the processed food industry but there is a lot more to the story and he does an excellent job exposing the truth.
B003EYDU60|1.0|i thought i was getting a hard copy and that is not i waanted. was happy with gettig it this waay
B008RZF1OU|3.0|Nothing to say about the music, I like Epica and Nightwish better but this is good too.<br /><br />I got this because it was a record and there is not much I can get for my record player, especially new music from genres I like. For this price, and given it was a brand new sealed record, I expected phenomenal sound. But some of the grooves are deeper than others causing the volume to go up and down all over the place. This might be a fluke and your record might not come out like that, but mine did. I wish i'd bought the mp3 set and burnt it on a CD for my car, instead of spending extra for the vinyl. Would have had better sound quality that way.
0470913029|5.0|This is the go-to book for the Paleo Diet. It covers everything you would want to begin eating a healthy & nutritious diet. This is my third day on Paleo, I've lost seven of the thirty pounds I want to lose, and have yet to feel a tinge of hunger. Speaking as a registered nurse, this plan is the best I've ever seen.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is one of the best historical dramas/love stories I've ever seen! I've watched it dozens of times, recommended my library purchase it which they did and have had friends watch it w/ me. Everyone loves it after they watch it. It provokes thought and social commentary. Good for a book club to watch together.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It's a great game and I seriously recommend this game to the ages 5-13. It's great and I know for sure that little kids will enjoy it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and very handy. A must have for every kindle lover. Calculator can be used for other advanced settings to fit any need. Excellent app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was absolutely fun and challenging!  A definite must have if you enjoy brain teasers and puzzles.  Loved it so much.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written story.  I couldn't put it down, but hated for it to end. Do yourself a favour and read this lovely book!!!
B00942G4UA|5.0|While I'm a capitalist...and a feed store owner...I thought this documentary was very enlightening and fair.  There was an obvious conclusion to be drawn, but it didn't seem to skew reality in its favor.  The videos were genuine.  The statistics appeared sound.  It'll definitely make you appreciate eating better.  It also helps explain why I have so many backyard chicken customers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique story line. Not for the faint of heart! The characters are well developed and anyone can relate to the need to protect those you love. It will make you appreciate everything you have, including your freedom!
B009IU6ITK|5.0|A little quick in the character development but the message is not obscured by too much detail. This is what I would say is Will Smith's strongest role. It is a well done movie on our ability to act without knowing the consequence.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|So easy to use, and it keeps me informed quickly of the weather in my area! I really like how it gives me bright red safety alerts, to let me know about the dangerous conditions in my area.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|Once again, Dexter proved to be an enjoyable diversion to what is on tv. He gets a little darker each year and will be eagerly awaiting the final season to see how it handles the Deb-Dexter conundrum.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Definitely one of Nicholas Sparks more heart wrenching books. I felt sad and hopeful all the way to the end!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Likes the game play and the graphics.  Don't like the buttons can be a little crammed.  I would recommend this game though (from 13 year old son)
B00005JL0I|4.0|I know this movie is a spoof on the James Bond movies, but I felt it worthy of a place in my collection.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|Great story about Frank McCourt, sad realities of growing up poor. Ending was a bit abrupt, but a great read from the perspective of a child
B002361MLA|5.0|Great book. Helpful in the fact that looking within yourself can empower you and yet understanding that we are a much bigger part of this universe then just ourselves. All of us are part of this universal energy that we can learn to utilize to improve ourselves as individuals and the world around us.
B001N2IWVI|5.0|I really like this movie because it really keeps you thinking the whole time! The only thing I thought was missing was the &#34;how&#34;. &#34;Who, what when where&#34; were all revealed during the course of the movie, but the &#34;how&#34; was not. The movie was AWESOME!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this for book club and I finished it within days (I'm  slow reader so days is good for me)!  So beautiful and touching!  I didn't want to put it down!  I love the characters!! I can't wait for the movie--thought I'm not too satisfied with the actors they've chosen.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Makes you feel like you are right there more than 70 yrs later- outstanding work - cant put it down
B00CMEQD30|4.0|I personally love any lesbian books with a happy ending, and this book is definitely it. Highly recommended. I just wish there's more intimate moments between the two protagonist, but overall, it's delightful.
B008UX8G5A|5.0|Alison Weir puts you right back in the 16th century -  wonderful prose- one of the best writers of the period
B00992CF6W|1.0|geyser should fix this app for all of.the kindle because this is fake cause my friend could get no problem on his but I cant
1577314808|5.0|I think we are a very unhappy group of people today. It seems that with more technology the greater the disconnect with reality. We have things but we don't know how to consciously live.<br /><br />The Power Of Now is a wake up call to literally \\"snap back to reality\\", to go from \\"living in your head\\" to \\"living in the moment\\". It sounds like crazy new-age talk but Tolle has a way of words to convey ideas that are almost impossible to articulate and makes you say \\"so true...\\". Really, a pure pleasure to read.<br /><br />That said, I wasn't a fan when Tolle ventures into science (e.g. \\"Slowing Down the Age Process\\") or when he tries to make connections with Jesus, a little farfetched for me. But the core of his message is a vitally important one and with it's practice more people will be happier.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A brilliant way to get your self thinking and a challenge to complete every room! A really good way to exercise you brain with memory and puzzle solving skills!
B00AI0YYCM|4.0|Although dated, he wrote it in 1949 I believe, the story is timeless and still very much applicable to today's concerns about nuclear war and climate change, i.e. destruction of Earth by human hands. The copy I got was very tatty but still readable. I do think that sellers of used books ought to have some standard of book condition below which they should not go. This one fell a bit below my standards.
0525425772|5.0|John Grisham's Theodore Boone series are written without inapproiate language, sexual scenes and fighting. The main character is clearly defined and captivating. This book and the others in the series are great gifts to children.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Much better read than fifty shades trilogy....great story line. Can't wait for the next chapter in Eva and Gideon story.  Ended too soon. Cary needs his own story too. Don't keep us waiting too long Sylvia.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|Nothing special. I was able to figure out exactly what was going to happen really early on. GF liked it though so I guess it was worth it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i use fb because my kids live out of town, but if there was something else out there I would leave fb... too many changes every day and they block without investagating submits and it not fair...i actually am bored with it, but like I said it keeps me conected to my kids for now
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Starting binge watching this series on Amazon. I had forgotten  just how good this show was. These 13 episode seasons took forever to watch on FX, when they would take 4 -6 week breaks in the middle of the season, it would take away from the plot and the pacing. But here you can watch back to back. If you love good cop shows and like watching anti-hero's, check out this show. Even if you seen it before, watch it again, it's that good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i have had this game for so long i play everyday fpr hours i recomend this app for people of all ages
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I'm a major Jack Reacher fan and I thought Tom Cruise was all wrong for Reacher, Reacher this big, hulking, tough kinda guy and Tom Cruise is the antithesis of that, but I think he pulled it off pretty well
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Game is pretty good but the movement controls are hard to use. Other then that it's really cool worth it

B003K16P3M|5.0|it was amazing i loved it graceling is an awesome book that everyone should read! kristin cashore is an amazing author!
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This was a very good movie.  The ending was surpising, I had to watch it twice to see if I could pick up on anything the second time around.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this was a lot of fun. not extremely hard but enough to get you thinking. totally worth getting. great way to pass time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is getting better and better! Can't wait for enchanting and multiplayer! It's showing more promise by the second!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The sweetness does not cloy, the description of the raw violence is not frightening. The silent desperate scream of women's forbidden voices is heard, together with the cry of a buried culture, faulty but culture none the least.
B000078DOI|5.0|About the time that Mother's Milk came out, folks where starting to notice the Chili Peppers, if for no other reason than their album covers, and their legendary antics.  This album predates me a bit, as I was not a fan of them going back this far.  I hadn't even heard of the Red Hot Chili Peppers when Mother's Milk was released.  However, I felt the call to purchase it after soon after I was completely blown away by Blood Sugar Sex Magik all the way back in 1991.<br />Had it not been for the antics of the Chili Peppers antics, I still regard it unlikely that they would have made it big without it.  Just as it was the naked baby on the cover of the Nirvana's Nevermind album that was a strong reason Nirvana was catapulted to stardom, so to was just having the word, \\"Sex,\\" in the Blood Sugar Sex Magik album title, the nudity on The Abbey Road EP, and the picture on the cover of Mother's Milk album the reason for this album's catching on.<br />So enough talk, what about the music?  Let me tell you this, if Mother's Milk doesn't deliver to you some of the best rock music you have ever heard, I think you need to get your hearing checked, or maybe even your soul, because Mother's Milk is full of funky soul music.<br />If you don't have the money for this one, then I would strongly recommend \\"What Hits? (1992)\\" or \\"The Best of the Red Hot Chili Pepper's (2005).  However, I wouldn't think of either of these albums as a substitute for getting the early Chili Peppers stuff that predates 1991.  Early in their career the Chili Peppers could do no wrong in my opinion.  Thus, while the greatest hits packages are good, they are no substitute for the early Red Hot Chili Peppers albums.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|An OK product does its job but a bit flimbsy.  The diamond sharpner is secure but it kinda feels like it could break at any moment.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really liked how the author introduced many different characters and at different times, but all weaves together in the end! I wanted to know these characters in this book!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The novel seems to have been written without any great focus apart from finishing the story. It lacks the action, imagination and suspense of the two earlier novels.
B00009P1O5|5.0|Neil Young entered the 80's with a country-rock album \\"Hawks And Doves\\", quite a departure from 1979's \\"Rust never Sleeps\\", but Neil again would surprise his fans with a rockin' affair with his backing band Crazy Horse, on \\"Re-ac-tor\\", his 14th studio album.  One story on this album, the ey made a commercial for one of the big box stores out there, and a girl was holding up the \\"Re-ac-tor\\", album, showing it to her mother, crazy stuff.  This album gave us some strong tunes in, \\"Surfer Joe And Moe The Sleaze\\", classic Neil, great guitar rocker, #56 MSR.  The train song, which Neil collects by the way, \\"Southern Pacific\\", the swift punchy \\"Op-er-a Star\\", \\"You We're born to rock, you'll never be an op-re-a star\\".  \\"T-Bone\\", gets slammed by the critics, but this is a great blues-rocker.  The smoldering punk energy of \\"Shots\\", the country shuffle with a lot of fuzz on \\"Motor City\\" and the motor lips of Neil  on \\"Rapid Transit\\".  A album you understand or you just don't no what's going on.  His last album with Reprise, he signed with Geffen and put out 5 albums with them, before returning to Reprise in 1988.  Neil would release the electronic-rock album \\"Trans\\", in 1982.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I knew I would get the best price and quality product from Amazon. I play my Cd often,her songs are incredible.Amazon always comes through for me.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Game is a lot of fun! I like that you can choose which path you can play instead of playing the one chosen for you!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is so much better than I thought possible. It's a claustrophobic thriller reminding me of Alien, it's deliciously post-apocalyptic, it's incredibly well written with great characters that feel real and astory that never sags or slows down.<br />I found myself dreaming of a high budget TV series based on it (a film would be too short, this story deserves some breathing space).<br />Hugely impressive. I can't recommend it enough.
B000O599XK|5.0|This is a great movie starring Martin, the DUKE, and Ricky Nelson too. Good action, a bunch of laughs, thanks to Walter Brennan.<br />TOM
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|awesome all the way around ....not hard to get money ot algea...colors are great and the missions aren't to bad
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 11 year old son.  He loved it.  He read it every night for a week and finished it.<br />His fanaticism for The Legend of Zelda is pretty far out there.  He's played and beaten nearly all of the games (except the first two; those old-school games are tough) and he even went to the Symphony of the Goddesses concert when they came through.  So, the point is that I'd call my son a Zelda expert, and him giving this book high praises sure says a lot.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|John Grisham always writes a good novel - on in which you do not see where he is going until late in the story.  A very readable mystery.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is the type of game kids should be mandated to master, before moving on to shooters.  I love it, actually gets me thinking.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I am so glad I read this book prior to the movie.  I realize you can't present a movie exactly like the book but there was so much more to the book that helped the story become real.  I didn't want to put the book down, it kept my attention when I wasn't able to read it.  Beautifully written and so touching. Would recomend this stor to everyone, I still keep the story in my thoughts even though I finished it long ago.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|A top notch fps. Only major thing holding it back from one of the must have games is It's a nightmare to link to a server for a multiplayer game. I've noticed this has been a huge complaint since the games release. Surprises me that a top notch company hasn't fixed this yet?
B003BW0CB6|4.0|This is the third Lincoln Lawyer Novel I have read and I liked it.  The other two I loved.  This story was compelling as this defense attorney who normally operates out of his Lincoln, agrees to be a special prosecutor for one case.  Why?  He is not really sure whether he is being set up by the DA or not on this retrial, as the Supreme Court has overruled the case and a new DNA test showed it was not that of the supposed murderer who has already been incarcerated for 23 years and is itching to get out and file a law suit.  He seems to take the case basically to impress his ex wife (a DA not involved in his selection) and his daughter who do not always think highly of those he defends.  He comes to truly believe the accused is guilty but proving it will be very difficult and may not be possible though he is ably assisted by his ex-wife (on the same side for once) and a half brother he hardly knows.  The case is fraught with emotion as the murder was that of a 13 year old girls and many of the witnesses are not longer alive or available.  The story is very well done, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, due to long drawn out trial issues, while necessary and understandable, did not hold my attention quite sa well.  However, I am hooked by this author and will read more.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love it and its great. I highly reccomend this app instead of the regular minecraft for 6 - 7 dollars. This is completely and totally free with no in-app purchases that I have found so far. Its persect and I actually think its better than a 5 star app!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think this is a great game. It has a lot of option. Very good looking graphics. The tutorial is very detailed. I have spend a few hours playing it and I like it very much. Recommended..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its so much fun n old because the old games but creative.with the points  that why im rating like 255000 point wow.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|This is a movie that both children and adults will enjoy. My husband and I are \\"seniors\\" and loved the creativity of the giant's, the storyline, and the characters. Hey, you have the villain, the heros, a princess in distress and giants who would love to eat all of them. What more could you ask for? The special effects weren't as hokey as I thought they would be. They were fantastic! Great twist on Jack and the Bean Stalk! What once was old, is made new in a good way!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I totally enjoyed these room escapes. Great exercises for the mind. I  want more! When will new challenges be available?  Let me know when more are available.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|This app is obvious spyware based on required permissions. Going ahead and &quot;buying&quot; it as the FAOTD, but absolutely not installing until they revisit their unnecessary and uncalled for permissions.
B000W93CHC|4.0|The book is a grea compliment to Pillars of the Earth.  It is a good insight as to how people lived in the 1300s in England.
B002VWNIDG|1.0|A real horror movie is one that makes look under the bed before turning off the light, and makes you pull up the comforter to cover your neck and ears before going to sleep.  Nothing like this here.  The back cover tells you:  \\"The first epic horror film - Jack Kroll, Newsweek\\".  That is not true.<br /><br />The scene in the bathroom, meant to be frightening, is just plain funny -- comic relief in a boring movie.  Jack Nicholson is not convincing as a madman: what you see is just an actor trying to look frightening.  His wife is good at screaming and being afraid, but somehow she doesn't manage to make you share her fear.<br /><br />In short, a boring movie, but you do watch it to the end, hoping that finally you will get some of the promised horror.  Believe me, you don't.<br /><br />My advice:  don't bother.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Interesting movie, more so now than when it first came out with all of the reality TV these days!  Love it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I didn't put the game down for two hours after first installing it, very addicting. The smaller boards are quite easy for an adult but the mega sized boards are a lot of fun. Give it a try, it's free after all.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I like this movie the delivery and the price was excellent.There are no video stores around and when they were around it was very hard to get newer and older movies
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|What a great entertaining movie even for adults. I hope the sequel is as hilarious as the first one was.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keep it coming. More individual puzzles that keep your brain moving and working in abstract solving mode. I need more levels!
0062255657|4.0|The central plot of this book is pretty standard Gaiman fare: young people step into a world that lies beyond the mundane stuff of daily life.  If it were just that, I'd give the book three stars; it is well-written, but rather bareboned, and most of all, it is very familiar for Gaiman readers by now.<br /><br />What makes this book more than a retread of The Graveyard Book, Anansi Boys, Neverwhere, Coraline, and much of Sandman is its framing, which actually manages to shed rather a lot of light on Gaiman's other works.  Viewed as a whole, the purpose of The Ocean at the End of the Lane is only partly to tell its story; it's further about why we (or at least why its author) bothers to tell stories at all.  This is what makes it important for Gaiman fans.  And maybe for others too.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Fun flick, now you know what happened to those kids after they grow up. The movie was a little campy but  was pretty good entertainment.  Lots of good action sequence.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|Considering that Bruce Willis is &#34;just a bit older&#34; than when he appeared in the first &#34;Die Hard&#34;, it's not surprising to see him slow by a step or two. The action sequences are very good, the plot convoluted enough to keep you guessing who is really the &#34;bad Russians&#34;, and the family subplot is OK. Perhaps it's the uneven pace or just the subject of Chernobyl that didn't enchant me but it wasn't a bad movie; just not my favorite of the series.
B00B4804KS|4.0|I enjoyed the original Jurassic Park when I saw it several years ago in a theater.  So when it came out in 3D I bought it and it is spectacular!  It is high quality 3D.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Addictive, can not put down the game.  Hope this will help people decide whether to purchase the game.  It is great fun. Please enjoy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is the best of the numerous calculator apps I've tried.  I can see what characters I've entered, thus ensuring that I actually did tap all the correct keys. Having 4 memory buttons is more functional than three - or none at all, and best of all is being able to review the history of all the characters I've entered for all the calculations I've done in a series.  IMO the best basic arithmetic app available, pretty much foolproof for this dyslexic grandma.
B000AQJPQE|4.0|I bought this for my nephews for Christmas, and then decided to get one for my son too. He loves it. What a great way to get kids talking about the planets on their own.... while easing them to sleep. Love it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Exciting, touching, informative, and action packed! One of the best books I've read in recent years. A great lesson in bravery and gallantry for this generation and those to come.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Set in early 1900's at a time when people kept private issues private. It is a delightful return to proper etiquette and family values.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|Great game, and fun for everyone. My friend and I both play it to compete<br />One problem I have is that it keeps freezing randomly. Perhaps its<br />My kindle, but I've had times where I finish a level and had to do it all again just because it froze.<br />May not be fair, but took a star away just because of my experience from it. I still play it though ;)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|My 9 year old loved playing this game with me. She too is now hooked on mystery game and can't wait for me to find a other just like this one. Good mini games ans only had to use the help function to find locations at times but love there was soon many rooms and pop laces to travel to.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|The theme and plot of the movie is well presented.  The stars did a supurb job of playing  their roles. The scenes were very good and the title of the movie really tells it all. You can't wait to see what happens next. A big thumbs up.
B00821OX98|4.0|Written in the typical Si-Fi dialogue the Aliens have taken over earth and the resistance is gathering after the military has been wiped out. Truly the Samson and Goliath story of the earth vs Aliens.<br /><br />Intriguing engaging and good story lines.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I will always think of her having one of the most beautiful and powerful voices ever.  Sorry that she is gone, what a waste ot total talent and we will always miss her.  At least, with this CD, we can listen, remember and enjoy this great and wonderful talent that left us far too soon!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good to waste time with. Not very hard, just color and number codes hidden around room. Seems all the rooms were the same difficulty, didn't really get harder as you progress. But good for free.
B008DVJOG4|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites......there is no one else that can pull this emotion, out of a heart, like Celine can and does!  Her voice is powerful, soothing and makes me want to curl up in my man's arms and forget the world!  Buy this CD....you won't be sorry!
B00992CF6W|2.0|I guess its ok because I don't know a waste of money buy block story its way better buy that
B00CWY76CC|5.0|People who are dumb and cannot figure out the puzzles rate it low. Well don't believe it because it is not true. They're just to dumb to figure it out so they blame the game for it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I would recommend reading the books first as some of the written story is left out of the film. Normally I would say that's a flaw but in this case it made sense. The sets are great, the cast emotes the humanity and compassion of the characters. I can't wait until the next movie is out.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|CAUTION....very addictive challenging game. Liked it so much I had to get the full version. As the game progresses each new game is more challenging.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Keeps you on your toes. I read it in 8th grade and I am now 22 years old and read it again, just as good the second time.
B003TH14H4|5.0|I've become completely addicted to this show. This is one of the better shows on TV right now and glad I gave it a chance.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|What spoke to me was the fact that people yearned for each other but when they actually met the man had Alzheimer's and could not recognize his sister who did not know about him till it was too late. And yet, his whole life he yearned for her.<br />The impact of war on the existence of good people and people who became greedy and callous through the war is another aspect that touched me deeply.<br />The story told in the beginning of the book about the sacrifices people make because they love deeply is so moving and something that will stay with me forever.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is a perfect snug fit for my Kindle paperwhite. I know that the protection from the Belkin is excellent since I had a larger size for my Kindle 2. A few \\"drops\\" with no bad results.!<br />You can't beat this price.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very graphic sadism &sex at times.  Pushed all my buttons - locked room mystery, little guy after the bully, great denouement.  Will definitely read the next book.
B008CFN95I|5.0|Original and combines some useful themes for secondary students... Computer use,  mystery, book world.<br />I don't '  feel I need to add six more words, highly recommended.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I really hope Netflix does a season 2, it has been one of the most intriguing shows I've watched. I recommend it to anyone okay with a little nudity and some harsh language.
B003FFEX8C|1.0|Horrible movie which had so much promise.  The cinematography appears to be done with severe ADD and a serious meth problem.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Catan is my favorite strategic board game. When my brother and I play we get very competitive which is fun, reminds me of super late nights playing Monopoly except it's not as long of a game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had a wonderful time reading this book. This book was so moving and realistic. I also loved the relationship between Gus and Hazel.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This  movie is beautifully acted, gripping in suspense, and contains many surprises. The parody of antidepressant commercials, and pharmaceutical culture is brilliant. The issue it raises (the role of psychiatric medications in treatment of depression) is disturbing and provocative (although greatly oversimplified, since medication in psychiatry--when handled responsibly-can be an important component of a broader treatment approach in those who are depressed). This movie is both a commentary and a thriller.
B00932DCS8|5.0|This Scandinavian thriller starts out like a caper story as told by a master thief but quickly develops into a nail-biting chase through the Norwegian countryside. Great acting and surprising plot twists in spades. Based on a novel by the great Jo Nesbo. In Norwegian with English subtitles but you will forget that after the first 5 minutes.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I have to admit, it's a pretty fun game. I actually think I like it better than the original Temple Run and even Temple Run 2. So that already says something. To me, I really enjoy playing it because of the \\"magic portals\\" you travel through to get to the other lands. It keeps the game interesting. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five, was because of two reasons:<br />1. I really wish there was more than one character to play as. Oz gets old after awhile, and I REALLY want to play as the China Girl. Also, they should make Finley an actual character, and not just a boost in the game.<br /><br />2. Maybe it's just my phone (Samsung Galaxy S3), but I've noticed the game studders often. This causes it to not process my swiping, and I end up dying instantly. It seems to happen the farther you get, and the more obstacles come about. It's like it freezes for half a second, then an obstacle comes out of nowhere, and BOOM! You're dead. Just as you were about to get a highscore.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the game is really fun and challenging. And the graphics are amazing! The scenery is so realistic looking! And it's really easy to get coins too. So is it worth $0.99? I'd say give it a try. It'll keep you entertained, so it does the job.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|I'm glad that I streamed this movie versus purchasing. I enjoyed the previous movies, not this one. The dialect was difficult to understand at times. No chemistry between father and son. Yes, lots of explosions, cars crashing in in every possible way, guns, big guns, typical of Die Hard, but not enough to carry the movie. None of the characters were interesting.
B004NELBPC|5.0|I have always followed this news outlet on my Android phone and on my computer.  This app for the Kindle is excellent.  Easy to find categories, etc.  I recommend this app for anyone who wants to keep up on the latest news.  HuffPost has a wide variety of story topics and I find it to be categorized well.  I never have a problem finding news in a particular category that I want.
B001THZAAI|5.0|This is a delightful movie from start to finish.  My husband and I had seen it several years ago on an international flight.  I couldn't remember the title, and contacted the airline to help with that.  They didn't seem to know what they aired on their flights.  This May we were in Paris and I asked a tour guide if she knew the plot and she said &#34;oh yes, it is my favorite movie!&#34;  She wrote down the title and as soon as I got home I searched on Amazon and there it was.  It is subtitled, easy to understand and enjoy.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Got to watch the next season because this one was awesome. Just the right mix of violence, drama, and suspense. Love the sons of anarchy!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|the color-the music-the good witch-the bad witch-I could watch this movie and I have-five more times.<br />thank you ernest-charlottesville va
1781162646|5.0|Why is it, that I never seem to get anything done once I start reading a Stephen King book. Love the retro Hard Case Crime. Read it!  You won't be disappointed.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|You'll want to see 'Psycho' again. One will probably look and see things they never realized were there. Enjoy it!
B006CHML4I|5.0|I love the style and practicality of the watch. I might even get another one with a different color band because the price is extremely reasonable.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|after reading many of kings books i knew their would be a good story in there and it didnt disappoint when i began the read. the story line a good one and i was gripped at first but, then it was really hard to stay with the character development, and kings political views became the predominant theme through the entire middle of the book, which became very redundant.... i give this book a &#34;c&#34; it could have been an exceptional read with less of kings personal opinions clouding up a great story line. just my two cents....
B008XG1X18|5.0|Even though I have several useful apps, banking, calculator, etc., on my fun Kindle Fire HD, Pinterest is my favorite fun inspiring one.  Not only do I find actual food to cook, DIY projects to make my home more organized or pretty, there are also ideas to ponder and daydreams to add.  Love Pinterest!
B009RH973I|5.0|The case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; was received promptly and was in excellent condition.  Thank you for your assistance
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|She always creates unforgettable characters, multi-faced, three-dimensionals individuals that I cannot help to like and that are a far cry to the standard \\"strong-willed-beauty tames the brooding-apha-male\\" that I find so often in romantic novels. This Robert (you should read \\"the Governess affair\\" to understand better what drives him but it is not strictly necessary) is maybe the most romantic guy of her recent books, his Minnie is a rather unconventional heroine, to put it mildly, and their story, if possibly unlikely, is highly entertaining and often very moving.<br />Sometimes Mr. Milan books are good, sometimes are better but she always writes with brains and with heart, and this one has a lot of the latter; I recommend it with all mine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i play all day even my mother says to get out of the house and go out and play but i stay indoors but sometimes outdoors but the game is so addicting
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|THIS WAS AN INTERESTING STORY AND I PATICULARY LIKED THE ENDING.  i WILL LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE OF CHRISTINA MCKENNA BOOKS.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Excellent documentary but a bit one sided. Many references to Monsanto and the big Agra farming complexes.  Would have been interesting to hear from them.<br />Nevertheless, my wife and I now understand why many of the corn products we eat cause us digestive problems. We also get why the chicken breasts are so large from some suppliers.<br />We now seek organically grown foods and farmers markets. Hopefully the GMO strains of grains will not take over the world!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This is a very interesting story that takes place in North Korea.  Being that it is such a closed country I knew next to nothing about North Korea and this book provided some information.  Of course, being fa novel, it is hard to know how much is real and how much is fiction.<br /><br />The story is on the depressing side but well worth the read.  I am only subtracting a star because I don't know if everyone would like the dark subject amtter.
B00821OX98|5.0|First series is swift, moving fast from one happening to another, while explaining the tale.<br />Doesn't loose time on non important details, but focusing on the survival and figuring out what to do next in order to survive...<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe too much military attitude for my taste, but in the given situation nothing's too much :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is not sci-fi, but it has the same kind of flavor to it.  Very creative and engaging, worth the read.
1451695195|4.0|with scientific training to prove that spiritual is what makes up physical! good reading! and there's still more to learn...
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|...that I can think of that could truly describe the worship experience one will have listening to and/or watching this CD/DVD.  Awesome is a start, anointed is another, but you must get ahold of this set if you are looking for a renewal in your life.  You will be deeply blessed!
B00COGXX7A|3.0|It was a good movie, but if you read the book, you will be disappointed. The book was much better.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|This movies was very good and is worth watching.  I watched it on my kindle fire HD and it's like being at the movies.  Good actions, good suspense. I do recommend checking this one out.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was very entertaining and addicting.  I would highly reccomend this game to a friend or family member as it really is that fun to play.
B008Y73940|3.0|This movie was ok.  I sorta fell asleep on it and had to finish watching it the next day.  Didn't really get interesting until the trial at the end.  Kind of reminds me of watching some of the urban movies from the 70's.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Once you're hooked, you're hooked. All you have to do is shoot a couple. Beware it uses a lot of battery power.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|loved this film when i saw it many years ago ,still a great film ,well worth seeing ,great fun ,two great actors jenny agutter and michael york
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun I cant wait for more levels ... please hurry.... it was so much fun we couldnt stop playing till we beat it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game. It isn't too hard but keeps you occupied. It is a fun way to pass time.
1400069742|5.0|Like Citizens of London and her Angry Young Man Olson gave us another gem to read. Can hardly wait to discuss this superb account of the times at our next book club meeting.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read all five books.  A detailed and engrossing series that maintains interest throughout.  They are a significant investment of time but well worth it
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I personally love film adaptations of books and immensely enjoyed Keira's performance of Elizabeth in PRIDE & PREJUDICE. However, this film was one of the worst films that I have ever forced myself to sit through. If you havent read the novel, you will never understand what is going with the characters. If you have read it, you will be thoroughly disappointed with the lack of important details of Tolstoy's storyline. It's a shame that they ruined this film, considering all of the amazing actors that were involved with it. I bet Tolstoy is turning in his grave as I write this.
B005TBN3EU|3.0|Look, there will never be another hangover, so don't expect it from the hangover 2.  The first time I watched this movie, it was late and I was out like a light before the car chase could end.  This time I watched it knowing full well that it wasn't going to be as great as the hangover and there were still moments I laughed out loud.  I watch the hangover once a year, just long enough to forget about some of the details and then I fall in love with it all over again.  I had to give hangover 2 another try out of my affection for the characters and it was worth the viewing.  Now I'm ready to go see hangover 3 in the theaters and it it's better than the second, then BONUS!!!!  I can't wait... in my secret little world, these guys are my friends.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|i LOVED THE KITE RUNNER  & ENJOYED READING OF A FAMILY HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY. KHALED HOSSEINT WRITES SO DESCRIPTIVELY & WARMLY THAT ONE LIVES THE EXPERIENCE.
159562015X|4.0|Didn't get much extra info in the book, but test that is included was very insightful. Good value for money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Just found the world of escape games.  One more addiction to have to deal with!  This one is pretty easy compared to others I've seen, and there are cheat sites for when you're hopelessly stuck.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Once or twice, I found myself smirking a bit at one of the storylines, but even then I enjoyed the acting so much that I was still very much connected to the show.  I've never noticed who did the casting for this show, but whoever it is deserves a raise.  Spot on.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Good overall book. At some points it was slow but not at all boring. 5 stars I think suits this book. I almost cried in some parts.
0143122010|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this book and was ready to believe some negative reviews I had read. The book is lengthy, going into a lot of details which sometimes look excessive, but at the end you have to agree that the reading was time well spent. I'm especially convinced by Pinker's emphasis on the role of reason and enlightenment in the decrease of violence (as Goya stated in his \\"Caprichos\\": \\"el sue&ntilde;o de la razon produce monstruos\\"). It's always possible to argue about some of the details, but the thesis stands firm. I really recommend it!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This is a great movie that is not to be missed! Powerful, gripping, everything a movie should be! Five stars!
B0073COMKW|5.0|These are very convenient and appear to be cheaper than other brands.  It is not as bulky as some bulbs.
B000FC10QG|4.0|The story of greed and excesses. Although the book details more in the drama and emotion of the the actors involved rather than the business calculation involved in the process, it's still provides a good insight of how most corporation are ran, and the chaotic conditions in which all-important deals are made.
B0097HC8MK|5.0|Excellent movie!  Best role for Nicholas Cage.  Elizabeth Shue was extraordinary - highly under rated actress.  To bad she didn't get other roles that allowed her to show the depth of her acting abilities.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|All levels were pretty easy, except for 10, as long as you have a piece of paper and a pencil
B008PZZV8S|4.0|Pretty good movie - it would have been better if it would have been a little darker with a more in-depth script.  There was a lot that could have been done with Matt Damon's character but only really skimmed the surface.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book is so unbelievable in the reality - but this is the core of its entertainment.  Wonderfully crafted list of calamities that just always have the characters landing on their feet.  Great read that was hard to put down.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|Good - Although a little extreme it shows how everybody has something going on in their lives that are generally related to those they are associated with.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Only rarely do I read a book that makes my shoulders shake and to actually laugh out loud.  My partner was constantly asking what was so funny.  I was completely connected with this kooky lead and cast of wonderfully rounded characters.  Well done!  I hope I don't have to wait too long before another offering from Mr. Simsion.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|My wife and I have a new favorite show! Main character is Bond level suave with partner learning along the way. Great show with a plot that locks you in.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie with lively colors, a good plot or story and a message to the world to save the ecology (all) in the world. I absolutely recommend this movie. Is a must.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|This movie is like eating cotton candy instead of a Snickers bar. With a Snickers, you get all sorts of good stuff wrapped up in this chocolate package that actually sticks to ya for a bit, wherein cotton candy, while sweet to the taste, usually ends up being more fluffy air than candy substance. With Hansel and Gretel, you get witches and witch hunters with karate skills that would make Chuck Norris proud, and more fancy gadgets that would make James Bond green with envy. Lots of fight and chase scenes where the good guys tend to get their butts handed to them before squeaking out a win in the end.  And you cant have a fairy tale witch hunting movie in Austria (or wherever) without a gatlin gun conveniently handy............yes, a gatlin gun, who would have thunk it. Most will say, \\"hey, lighten up, this is entertainment\\". Does that mean you kick out all good sense and logic and overdose on a bad case of silly to be entertained? The \\"Dark Knight\\" this is not, but hey, its entertainment right? Just shut off the brain and enjoy.....or more appropriately, take your brain out, shoot it with a crossbow, take a machete to it, light it on fire and throw it out a window. Enjoy!
B004G6009K|5.0|Beautiful and interesting movie. Impressive 3D effects and a very good and refreshing plot. I recommend this movie to everyone
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hopkins seemed to be doing his usual excellent acting.  I didn't find much I liked about Hitchcock but I loved the story as it portayed Hitch's wife.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|My favorite movie. I recommend this movie to all. Not only for children to enjoy, but for adults as well
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. It played well on my kindle with no problems which was a plus for me. Very clear and very addicting game. Enjoyed it very much.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I do not want to review this movie. I am insulted that you REQUIRE me to do so. I think you are over stepping my boundaries. I made a purchase, you sold me a product, that's it. I REQUIRE that this ends our business
B0041KKYD8|4.0|After seeing the original when I was a teenager not really knowing what it was about I gave it a try and it was ok. I broke down and got the remake today at work and I must say that this movie is way better then the original. This movie is not for everyone and defiantly not one for the kids or the faint of heart. I really don't think you can classify this has a horror movie as its not meant to scare but shock you. As many have said before me this is a revenge movie. Lady gets raped and then she gets her revenge one by one. I read some of the reviews and I think some of them are unfair. One guy said he didnt like how the movie was trying to shift your sympathy from the raped to the rapists. I think the guys got what they deserve but that is neither here nor there.<br /><br />*PLOT SPOILER*<br />Ok with out going too much into detail for those who have not seen it or the original a girl named Jennifer is moving to the quiet country side to right a new novel. On the way she meets a few guys at a gas station and makes the big mistake of telling them where she was going. After a couple of days they brutally rape and degrade her. Thinking that she is dead they start to cover their tracks but get brutally murdered one by one.<br />*END SPOILER*<br /><br />The movie was well thought out as far as the story the background the rape scene the revenge and the closing scene. The rape scene wasnt overly done like it was in the original. There was some nudity but not alot...the movie wasn't ment to be sexy in the first place. The revenge scenes were well done and not cheesy like they were in the original either. Jennifer was well played in this one besides some of the corny one liners during the revenge scenes. To me she looked like Kristen Stewart but she actually showed some emotion. It is gruesome and the revenges will make you cringe espically if your a guy. There are a few parts of the movie that either dont make sense or they dont fully explain why or how but it doesnt killthe movie or the plot. All in all I will say that it was a prety good movie and is well worth a look if you are into those kind of movies, if not you should probably pass this one over. If your not into rape scene movies you might still like it as it was somewhat tastefully done if there is such a thing.
B002M87W9K|5.0|This movie is, of all beloved musicals, my favorite and the best. A classic. Amazon makes these treasures so easily available and affordable. Two wonderful hours of music and memories of a time passed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Four Stars for the great idea- and it's FREE. Nice enough  graphics and interaction, challenge is medium level- and just plain fun.<br />Reminds me fondly of &#34;MIST&#34; a long- ago computer game. Which was fantastic. ( HINT:Wish they'd bring it THAT back in a new format:) Worth Downloading this game! Thank you to the designers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game, but way too short. I finished it in an hour or so. I still recommend it, since it's free.Try it, tthere's no reason not to.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|If you like predicable TV weekly show who-done-its you should probably consult with your Dr. before you subject your heart to the stresses of watching this one.  This has more twists and turns than a politician in a debate.  But, unlike the politician, the ending is more satisfying.
0425263924|5.0|I LOVED this book. I really enjoyed seeing some of the normal, day to day interactions between Gideon and Eva. That's what I frequently wish to see in many of the books I read. I'm now happy that we get two more books of Gideon! Cant' wait.
B0091R30MS|5.0|Years of careful research have resulted in a wonderfully entertaining account of early Chinese maritime travels.  It could be a fairly &#34;dry&#34; topic but has been written in such an interesting way that it is very difficult to put it down - even for a short time!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Be prepared to cry!  Amazing how a movie  like that can be filmed!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|A story and a plot that lands on each viewer from a different angle.  Like the story the viewer is left to wonder what really happened.  It is a great pivot point for any conversation.
193700788X|1.0|The entire book seemed like a headling rush to a very unfulfilling ending to a heretofore delightful series.  The feeling is Ms. Harris became tired of it and to give it a finish, as all series much reach, decided to put the heroine back into a boring, mundane life and make Sookie just another boring, mundane human. Granted, for the author that may be the only way it could end - but it was the way it was written.  The pinnacle of disappointment, for me, was the way characters were written as if the emotions felt for one another throughout the entire series never really happened and was, poof, gone. I understand it must be difficult for an author to come up with a satisfactory ending for all fans but, again, for me this was totally unsatisfactory.  I can totally get behind a sad ending or one that blindsides. This ending just felt like a throwaway.  By the way, I  watched a few episodes of True Blood on HBO and if I was Ms. Harris I would be furious at what they have done.  I think the &#34;based on&#34; scenario is way out in left field.  It Is Awful.  Again, my opinion.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie to review the sensitivity of foreign relations between governments.  The characters are well played and the suspense is truly spell binding.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Very entertaining for all the cast was great Mila amazing special affects were good we didn't see it in 3d we can only imagine how much better it would have been
0307956350|3.0|Disappointing book.  I will not fall for Amazon suggestions again.  It is a shallow story that left me wondering why I kept on reading.
B0027MJU00|3.0|I liked the way the story went back and forth with different character perspectives. At the same time, I didn't like the back and forth-  but it kept me wanting to turn the page. It felt like something was missing but pretty good character development on the part of main character- not enough for some of the other characters. I would recommend for people who like crime/  mystery... pretty quick read.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|If you are on your discovering yourSelf path, this is a great addition or a starting point. Beware though, it will change your life forever ... in the good way :)
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Loved season 7. Dexter is still amazing. Great plot, acting, and script.Big fan. Watch the seasons in order if you haven't seen it before.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Lots of action great to see, watched it 3 times . Would recommend to watch a movie worth seeing just for the action.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I've played about 10 of these types of games on my Fire and this is one of the better ones.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|I choose this rating because it was a worth will movie to see, with abundance of shooting scenes. If you get a chance see it you won't be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so addictive...I haven't put it down since i downloaded it! Some of the levels are really challenging. I can't wait for new levels!
B005544TRQ|3.0|Lotta laughs here sort of high middle ground for a TV series<br /><br />so you want seven more words, then don't expect good ones.  I have to say what I have to say . Don't tell me I need seven more words
B006G3JQ78|5.0|It is about 30 minutes too long, but otherwise a fantastic movie. So much talent. Good, wholesome entertainment. It can be a little tricky for the kids to understand some of the English accents at times, but it didn't detract from their enjoyment. My youngest lost interest at some points because the plot is somewhat grown-up but not inappropriate at all.  My 9 year-old says, &#34;It is awesome and funny.&#34;
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I don't get why they have so many 1 2 3 4 rates I mean c`mon it is simply the best game in the market . Like Who doesn't want to play and then play more . If you are good at one try to unlock the other . It isn't hard . This is the game I play almost every time I turn my kindle fire on. Thanks for putting this game out there ! Y'all rock !
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nice music cute fish and game. Perfect if you love the ocean.  Fun to play and good for kids and adults.
B001N4OX82|4.0|I like this movie although it has a lot of violence. It gives a very close description of the Iliad without getting an M rating. I would definitely not recommend for young children, because it has, as I said before, a lot of  violence, although it shows as few corpses as possible. So no children under the age of 8!<br /><br />Good but violent.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This isn't the typical &#34;shoot-'em-up&#34; read -- the authors have taken the time to put the life of a Seal in context with the world as it is, political and otherwise. A well written and engaging documentary of real events.
1451620829|5.0|Peter Criss is and always will be my idol I saw Kiss for the fie=rst time I was 13 and the Catman was my idea of the best drummer ever I am now 50 still playing and thanks to Peter my drive will never die I met peter when I was about 19 and he left a lasting impression on me he wasn't your typical big headed egotistical Butthole. He was well grounded and down to earth. Read this book and you will see the real Peter Criss. If you see this Keep rockin Peter Catman rules  Johnnie Dee
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good level of challenge! Can't wait to see what other levels they come out with. I found it challenging, but not frustrating.
B009RH973I|5.0|this is one of three cases I have purchased and by far it is my favorite.  I can plug in my kindle without having to open the case, and the soft interior does not scratch the face of the kindle.
B0000067L2|5.0|I had been looking for this album for years, primarily for the song &#34;Tales of Brave Ulysses.&#34; I had never thought to look on Amazon because nobody else could get it for me. Then one day I typed it in and here it was!!!! In my opinion, Cream's best album and Clapton's best work period.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I've been looking for this app FOREVER! It's made just for the Kindle fire HD. And now I don't have to go through the slow internet just to get to it. GREAT app!
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|toca boca.  hairsalon 2 is better more realistic. this is a cheap copy the toca boca  is in amazon app store it is I think 3.99 u.s dollars I have it so I should. know
6301971272|1.0|What the heck was this mess?  A three hour movie with no plot until over half way through?  Voice overs like a Godzilla movie and lame dialog.  This must have been awesome for Clint Eastwood because he has only about 10 minutes of dialog in the whole movie.  My wife and I watched this whole movie just to see if the ending made it, but nope...we couldn't figure out why this movie is so popular.  The only think I can come up with is the music.  There is just nothing here, and its so long and boring.  Ugh, next time I'll watch static for a more entertainment.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Sometimes the story drags and becomes very confusing.  The girl, Salinger is not very believable.  I will read the rest  of the series
B0063M22QO|5.0|Many levels of difficulty.  Enjoyable for hours (especially when traveling on long plane flights), and quite relaxing to play while listening to music.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|At 41, I don't think I'm in the targeted demographic for this movie. My 17 year old son highly recommended this movie. Needless to say, his movie recommendations will fall on deaf ears from now on. A teddy bear that smokes pot and sleeps with prostitutes only sounds entertaining if your stoned or extraordinarily immature.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Reasonably well written tale, but the story overall was underwhelming.  Perhaps it was the repetition of the theme:  brilliant guy breaks the rules, forced to pay consequences, advances to next scenario.  Perhaps it was too much technology and not enough magic.  But whatever, by the end of the book I was skipping several pages at a time.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|A very impressive film, wonderfully restored!  The color is magnificent .  I enjoyed this version and I am happy to own it.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|The comic book come to life! Robert Downey Jr. rocks as Tony Stark..... This is an awesome movie - I Highly recommend it!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Written like all of  Dan Brown's novels.  Suspenseful, fast moving and an interesting story line.  Not the best writing int he word but very visual and the reader continually thinks of the storyline as a movie
B006LSZECO|4.0|After all I'd heard, this wasn't exactly how I thought it would be. There's never been a more savvy plotter when it comes to appearances, love, or the perfect crime. You are driven to love and hate this character simultaneously and completely. A fun read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an amazing game! It drains almost all of my battery!! am I at 20 yet? :) anyway I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!!!!! If you don't like this app hell
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Entertaining, and well done, but ultimately a bit disappointing. Acting is fine, but the story line is a bit unrealistic.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|lots of fun.  challenged my critical thinking skills.  didn't want to put it down until I knew I had solved the puzzle.
B000IZ7YK6|4.0|Very good movie, but so intense you really need to pay attention to appreciate all it offers! Great acting and worthy of the Oscars it received.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Kept my interest through out the book, once I started to ,read it couldn't put it down.  Very interesting turn of events for the ending. Very well written
B0094KTA4Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when this movie made me happy. It put me in a really good mood. I recommend this movie. :-)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It has everything you can want in a novel. Adventure, mystery, romance, & 80s pop culture. An amazing novel that will leave you wanting more... including  having an 80s movie marathon when you're done!
B00005JLEX|4.0|The person we gave it too never complained, so I will assume all good and give a 4* rating. Thanks
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This is a very insightful book that explains why we do the things that we do without thinking. Time to start making conscious decision and change bad habits.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is great! so much fun! not too easy. cannot wait for more levels!! :) it reminds me of the game 100 floors. awesome! :)
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A beautiful glimpse into the old English countryside. Filled with charming characters interacting in their daily lives, one the lower class of society, the other dignified city dwellers. The interweaving of these lives make this show quite interesting.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. very fun to try and figure out how to get out of the rooms. its not too easy and not to hard. I will be twiddleing my thumbs until they make more levels :) cannot wait!
B00821OX98|4.0|Enjoying the series so far. Decent quality actors along with a good story line. Keeping the nerd in me happy so far. Nothing extraordinary like firefly or startrek or even sG1.
B003MS0UHU|5.0|This was a delightful follow on to the previous Ice Age movies. All the characters are now well developed, and one new one (Buck) was introduced. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and the price was right.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Loved it. If you like mystery then you will love solving the cases along with Sherlock. Very good mini series watched the whole season because I just couldn't get enough.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|When I began the book I found it difficult to read because of the brutality and harshness describing the manner in which  the main character lived as a child growing up in the orphanage.  Yet I became fascinated with the story and eventually, could not put it down.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|It is a great drama. Interesting period piece.  Love the settings and the interaction of the characters.  Great acting and cinematography.  Just, well done.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this bag for my wife. She likes it very much. It is lighter than her older bag and still can carry all her equipment which includes a SLR with 3 lenses and  mirrorles with 1 lens. None of the lenses are small.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I really did like the layers.  I had to watch the movie quite a few times to catch everything and check the nuances.  I do not care much for Dicaprio, but he was tolerable and did not detract much from the movie.  If you like time travel, Matrix like effects, lots of action, and Sci Fi, it is a must see.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It is what it says it is and it works like it is supposed to work. Great deal, great story.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Just a great simple story, with lots of action and great actors.  It looks like everyone on the set had as much fun making it as I had watching it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very cool!  I will be sure to share it with my friends.  It's not typical of a game I would choose.
B000U6BT40|5.0|I love the shows I have seen so far.  I am starting season 3.  I am starting to like most of the characters although some of the development was disappointing.  I don't get the lovable, goofy but competent sheriff thing -- I felt it overdone.  Columbo comes to mind for some reason.  I like the plots and again the characters and the acting is good.  Worth watching.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Pam Grout writes as if she were sitting at your kitchen table sharing a cup of tea with you! I would love to actually do just that, and share her enthusiasm in person!!!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Simple and fun game great for when you are waiting somewhere.  The time flys when I am playing  Great for kids too.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I thought that this was going to be the last of the series and I guess I am wrong.  You have to read it to find out why.  It was as good as all of the Reacher stories, which is saying quite a bit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing. Can't wait for more levels to come out!<br />Even my nephew and niece (6 &amp; 8) enjoyed it!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I can't tell if the reason this film is so bad is because of bad writing, or bad acting! Maybe alot of one and a little of the other. You pick which one.<br />The visuals were OK, but the pace of the film was a little jumpy, spending too much time on little things that looked good, and not enough time on things that were important.<br />I'm glad I didn't see the movie in theaters, and I probably could have waited to see this on Cable.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|So many times I would start this film and couldn't get into it.<br />I am so glad I tried it again because it is so worth it.<br />Season One is incredible.<br />If you are a history buff, you will definitely enjoy it.
B00C7O8TSM|3.0|The &#34;boys&#34; are sounding a bit croaky. Those golden pipes just ain't what they used to be. Still, the tunes are as great as ever.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Not a bad flick. Good cinematography and decent storyline.  A bit over the top a few times, and the Matrix bullet move add is a bit lame. But still, worth a rent.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is the most amazing game ever. Even though it throws you out some times its worth it. It is super easy to get started and even though I've been playing for 3 days I already have over 8 armour. It's a lot like temple run 2 but with guns and explosions. It does take extra data but it's worth it!
B008M721MS|5.0|It's a great way to keep in touch with my children instead of having a phone to my ear. I hate talking on phones & do not own a home phone so this is a wonderful invention. I can see & talk to my kids & have my hands free at the same time or move around the room to do things while talking to them. Wonderful invention.
B0060D2WYI|3.0|This is a good movie to add to your collection if you have the other wizard of oz films.  The kids enjoy this movie.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Along with &#34;Pretty in Pink&#34; and &#34;16 Candles&#34; this is one of the best views of teenage years one would rather remember then relive. The awkward relationships and puppy love.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|This is a good movie.  It is very appropiate for kids.  The kids enjoyed it a lot.  Some parts are a little cheesy, but I think that's because it is geared towards kids.
B009GED3HS|4.0|I really like this tv series. I just keep hoping Ted will find who he is going to marry.  Mean while everyone can remember what its like to be young and single.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|amazed how well they blended the fairy tales and real life as well. acting is pretty good. I couldn't stop watching and can't wait for the next season!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game can be frustrating at times since there are absolutely no tutorials that pop up, ht once you get the hang of what to do, it's very engaging.

0545265355|5.0|Finished these books in two days! I absolutely love this series now. Seriously one of the best things I bought that year. =)
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I like it, and take it with me on all my travels.  It makes reading easier and watching videos or listening to music easy.  Great protection for the Kindle.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|If angst and second-guessing were natural resources, WORLD WAR Z alone could power the planet for years. Initially handed a $125 million budget but then escalating to $200 million, primarily because of seven weeks' worth of reshoots, this was one blockbuster them critics were tapping as the potential summer skunker. Detractors will surely rally around the \\"This movie veers away from the book\\" flag, and it's a valid gripe. This isn't an adaptation of Max Brooks' source material but more a hijacking of the guy's book title. The book takes place a decade after the zombie war and compiles a series of personal accounts as told by the survivors. It offers gripping insights regarding the abrupt crumbling of society, how the apocalypse impacted on a religious and geo-political scale. Brad Pitt presents us with a horror thriller that suffers some from schizophrenia. It promises to be this sweeping zombie saga but then backpedals into a third act that focuses on personal conflict. The film has flaws, absolutely. Still, I walked out of the theater with a paranoid grin on my mug, edginess in my bones. I think this movie's gonna make money, bad buzz and all.<br /><br />Brad Pitt has had a fantastic film career for someone so homely. Here, he takes a page from Will Smith in I AM LEGEND. He plays Gerry Lane, a resourceful former investigator for the U.N. called back into the field to locate the source of the global zombie pandemic. Gerry isn't a gung-ho sort anymore. He'd rather stay and protect his family, but he's presented with an ultimatum: either get with the program or his wife and two young girls get kicked out of the safety of the command ship, the U.S.S. Argus. So off he goes to South Korea, escorting a wet-behind-the-ears genius virologist and hoping to track down Patient Zero.<br /><br />My pals railed like fishwives that there weren't enough gore and blood and viscera, and they're not wrong. Way I see it, the budget had risen to such exorbitant heights that the suits freaked that the film wouldn't be able to recoup the cost. And so the hard R rating had to go because more people would attend a PG-13 picture. I'm a little surprised I wasn't as upset as my friends, but I was enthralled with the film's effective approach to classic Hitchcockian suspense. Your imagination does a lot of heavy lifting here. The first 20 minutes are as urgent and nerve-jangling an opening sequence as the one in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. I like that there isn't a set-up. There's a brief interlude in which the Lanes go thru their breakfast ritual. But then you're dropped in the thick of things and swept along by the escalated level of panic taking place onscreen. Philadelphia and Jersey become these terrifying, claustrophobic urban landscapes as the Lanes frantically wend their way thru the surging undead and the frenzied human mobs. In the dark, in my seat, I couldn't help thinking, \\"If one person in this theater turns right now, we're all so screwed.\\"<br /><br />It's probably a mutant super-power to be able to distance a film from its source material, to view it as its own animal. I think I have it. Or maybe I got caught up with the massive fun of watching this in a packed house, a victim of a more genial sort of mob mentality. These fast-moving zombies scared the crap out of me, and I'm sure part of that is how someone bitten can turn in twelve seconds flat. It's up to you to buy into the CG stuff. Some of the scenes are over-the-top, like how the zombies in 1srael swarm and pile like Internet trolls. The personal drama loses oomph as Gerry Lane's wife (Mireille Enos) spends huge chunks of the film with a death grip on that satellite phone, waiting for our main man to call. We maybe would've been more invested had Lane's family been placed even more under duress. It sucks that Mireille Enos isn't given better and more things to do, because I think she's good here.<br /><br />The third act was supposed to have featured an epic invasion of Moscow, except thatthat was scrapped but for a few fleeting shots. Instead the third act culminates Gerry Lane's globetrotting quest in Wales, in a W.H.O. lab complex breached by zombies. This sequence features a downshift for how zombies are portrayed. The laboratory ghouls are near dormant, one scientist's exposition informing us that, unless activated by visual or auditory stimulus, they just aimlessly mill around like broke window shoppers at the mall. What unfolds in this sequence is tense stuff, but it also resurrects the more familiar zombie tropes. There may be some nervous laughter.<br /><br />WORLD WAR Z, more than any other zombie film, captures the global scope of the zombie apocalypse. I loved the speed and urgency of the narrative, and how it realizes and sustains the harrowing feel of end-of-the-world jeopardy. No, it's no in-depth meditation on society's collapse. But it's a hell of a wild rollercoaster ride done on a breathtaking scale. And, as a throwaway comment, I loved the concept of the Tenth Man.<br /><br />A few tips on surviving a zombie apocalypse (SPOILER alert):<br /><br />- When driving away from a pack of zombies, don't turn around for an extended period to impress the importance of the seatbelt rule on your kids<br />- When navigating a gauntlet of noise-sensitive zombies, do turn off your phone<br />- Don't ever leave your bloody crowbar behind<br />- When trapped on a plane with an oncoming rush of zombies, stacking up luggage in the aisle sucks as a deterrentthat was scrapped but for a few fleeting shots.

B008P9M614|5.0|It has the shows that you ordered.Quality veiwing, I was pleased with the Product. Worth the money that I spent.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|We bought this pool last summer for our son who had just turned one and enjoyed it all summer. I like having the option to turn the sprinkler options on the sides on and off. The depth of the water was perfect and it held just the right amount too. We packed it up for the winter and it will not hold air as well as it did last summer but I still think it was well worth the purchase cost for our 1 year old last summer. Looking for a deeper one this summer since he is a bit older. I recommend this for younger children!
B002M9WW30|1.0|only 3 dvd worked they others didn't. But u guys where great with the refund right away.Thank u for that. But would of liked all the dvd to work.
B00957T6X6|1.0|Can't easily navigate to correct page if you started one of the books prior. Also, page numbers are cumulative for the series, so you can't rely on them within each book.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I find  that flow  free is  too easy  maybe  if I get  into a  later game it will be  more challenging
B009R659L8|4.0|Mary Higgins Clark, Daddy's Gone A Hunting<br />Didn't want to stop reading it. As usual she kept me spellbound with her story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is great. I play it all the time much better than the first one. great for all ages.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Works great for my Knidle. Simplicity was what I needed & this is perfect. Just getting started w/my new tablet so I'm sure I'll be back for more.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The kids love this game.  I'm sure it is good.  It was downloaded easily.  I've not heard complaints and it must be o.k.  they play it all the time.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great cinematography.  The lead scares me as much as Jeremy Brett, or Basil Rathbone use to scare me.  Watson is a bit too 20th century paranoid for my tastes.
B0094POVZM|5.0|I love all the movies with intense drama, and as a plus my favorite actors are in it.Itwas<br />A pleasure.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game is a challenge to me, therefore I can play it and is a lot better than some of the other games I have tried
B009NXAMW6|5.0|Excelent movie for adults, actors are well known and their interaccions perfects
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game because it's fun and now you can update it.<br />I think everyone should get it.<br />you can build anything you want like a mansion or a cabin.<br />this is one of the best games period.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I'm an avid Facebook user and this app is perfect for me.  It's nothing special, just Facebook the way you want it.
B008Y73940|5.0|Great Movie - loved every minute of it!  Even though you thought you knew the outcome, it still keeps you in suspense.  What a performance from Matthew McConaughey.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a very timely book.  With women being held as prisoners for years and forced to raise a child in that situation, this book helps you understand some of the true implications on a child.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|I can get my home setting with no streets in the city.  Asked for another state and all I got was the state.....no roads or anything.  Couldn't navigate to get anything.  Very disappointed.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This story is disturbing on so many levels.  Even to think about people being tortured in our modern civilization is shameful.  It had to have taken great courage for him to even force himself to recall of of these horrible things that have happened in his life.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|Too many freezes. This should have been a test drive, then decide if you want to purchase. Had it performed this way during a test drive, no purchase from me.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. I play it daily. Yes, I'm hooked. The Facebook connectivity is awesome. I recommend this to anyone
B007SGM084|4.0|With all the hoopla about this trilogy, I was expecting great things.  I wasn't disappointed.  It started a little slow but picked up around chapter 6 or 7. From that point, I couldn't put down my Kindle.  I completed the trilogy in about a week.  My only issue is that the language is somewhat repetitive.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It normally is not my fault I die it is the games fault I have saved up 699998 my highest. Of it score was 4567 I checked all of this but I do sometimes love it
B001XV09UG|4.0|Do &#34;people&#34; really do that? Eye opening experiences. Didn't expect x rated with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Date rape movie!
B0037471SU|4.0|A storyline that kept me guessing all the way through with an ending I was not expecting! A great read!
B0026772N8|5.0|gave it to my 18 year old son to read. the author's alternate and rational thought processes should be mandatory reading for the kids of today. the real world has passed them by.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Quirky and fun puzzle game! A cute story to go with the puzzles. Normally I can take or leave tablet/phone games... but this one hooked me.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I went into this movie without any hopes at all because my girlfriend wanted to watch it.  To my surprise it turned out being a fun little movie even for an adult such as myself.  I won't be as hesitant to watch the second one that's for sure.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book kept my interest from beginning to end.  I read the &#34;The Hit&#34;, his latest first, and enjoyed it very much so went looking for what else he had written with the character Robie and found the Innocent.  Just as good!  Can't wait for the next book featuring Robie.
B000VJ271A|5.0|First, truly imaginative staging and sumptuous costumes, so one is never visually bored.<br /><br />Second: superlative singing by the principals.  Dessay is probably the best current Manon, and Villazon virtually owns Des Grieux--his recording with Nebretko is also on the market. Villazon is in every way Domingo's rightful heir.<br /><br />Third: any Liceu production on DVD is quite welcome.  I am amazed at how diverse and challenging its productions are.  A pity Massenet overloads his opera with ballet, but then, we all know why the French loved ballets in opera!<br /><br />Choose this one.  You will not be sorry.
B000U6BT40|5.0|One of the more refreshing shows that I have seen in a while.  The characters of the show are quite quirky but you grow to love the character from the &#34;normal&#34; sheriff in town to the super geniuses of the high IQ place of Eureka.  Good writing and good humor makes this one of the more up-beat show where the average sheriff rescues the town from it's own geniuses.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book, although it was interesting for me that there was sayd inside that outside. Very nice story.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The game is ok to pass the time. Missing some options of computer games, but adequate. Would recommend to other kindle owners.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great move with Bruce Willis in a comedy roll and all the other actors were great.  Cannot wait to see RED 2.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|Hans Zimmer's work on Christopher Nolan's DARK KNIGHT trilogy proved to be the sign of a composer evolving.  His theme for Batman was two simple notes, varied in pitch, and performance by different instruments, backed with either heavy percussion or strings.  His theme for the Joker - an almost unbearable high single note on an oboe or violin string, combined at times with the taping of pencils on a hard surface, an entire string section, a rapidly played single violin, single building blasts of percussion, intermixed properly for each second the character appeared on screen.  For THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, his brilliant theme for BANE was a haunting, imposing primal chant accompanied by a distinctive, powerful military percussive movement that retained the same primal elements of the chant.  The theme then evolved into one that captured the terror and anarchy Bane brought to Gotham City.  In the same film, Zimmer utilized a mysterious and elegant melodic piano movement followed by slinky strings to define Selina Kyle's character.  For Batman, he inverted the two note theme's imposing nature with the use of piano and slow strings to reflect a fallen Bruce Wayne and Batman of the film's first half.  For the film's final act, he combined his Bane and Batman themes with constant, pulsing, bombastic percussion to insure the tension Nolan wanted over the film's final act remained at the 'high' level the director wanted.<br /><br />Zimmer insisted throughout the production of MAN OF STEEL that the music needed to be different than his DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY scores.  That Superman was a different character, one of 'light,' not 'darkness.'  Then he delivered the mess that is his score to MAN OF STEEL.  Prior to the release of each Nolan Batman film, listening to Hans Zimmer's scores were akin to a 'preview' of the characters and drama to come in the films.  Listening to his MAN OF STEEL soundtrack (DISC 1: FLIGHT, of this 2 disc set) was to simply hear three soft piano notes, a LOT of over-the-top horns, and track after track of RELENTLESS AND POINTLESS BOMBASTIC PERCUSSION POUNDED INTO YOUR EARS.  The score is akin to left-over scraps of outtakes from the final half of THE DARK KNIGHT RISES - minus any sense of 'character' or 'narrative.'  You don't miss John Williams theme to \\"Superman: The Movie\\" - you miss anything that resembles a film score!  You miss anything that resembles cohesive music!<br /><br />Its effect in the movie is predictable - it has none.  MAN OF STEEL is a magnificent film.  Visually stunning, with a sophisticated narrative structure, thought-provoking dialogue, great performances, incredible special effects, and - as any movie featuring Superman battling Kryptonian bad guys - a very complex, layered and loud sound mix.  THANK GOD director Zach Snyder, writer David Goyer, and producer Christopher Nolan delivered a film SO GOOD it functions perfectly WITHOUT NEEDING A MUSIC SCORE.  Upon a second viewing of the film, I did determine that Zimmer's score does serve one function in MAN OF STEEL - his bombastic percussion is utilized as 'sound effects' in the battle sequences, allowing the SFX editors and mixers to take down levels of breaking glass, collapsing buildings and explosions.  After seeing MAN OF STEEL twice, I still can't think of one moment where the music plays a key role in any scene.  Fortunately, I can't remember a moment where the film suffers from not having a film score.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the product 2 STARS is the inclusion of the second disc, DISC 2: EXPERIMENTS FROM THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.  The disc features Hans Zimmer's musical demos or 'sketchings' for the film.  And it is SHOCKING to hear JUST HOW DAMN GOOD A LOT OF IT IS.  In particular, the first track 'Man of Steel (Hans' Original Sketchbook)' runs over 28 minutes and reveals he WAS developing a rich, orchestral theme for Superman BEYOND THE FILM'S THREE PIANO NOTES.  The other tracks demonstrate that Zimmer was also developing separate and - potentially - rich full orchestral themes for Clark Kent, General Zod, and different battle sequences.  HOW IN THE WORLD MUSIC THIS RICH WITH SO MUCH POTENTIAL WAS WHITTLED DOWN TO THE SLOP USED IN THE FILM IS PATHETIC.<br /><br />Zimmer has reached a point in his career where he needs to cease scoring films in the manner he has for THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and MAN OF STEEL.  He has become such a minimalist that instead of just leaving the meat on the bone, he's turning in bone marrow and calling it a film score.ping separate and - potentially - rich full orchestral themes for Clark Kent, General Zod, and different battle sequences.

B002XWXPC8|5.0|A good laugh and enjoyable entertainment to be had.  Just a good relaxing comedy for a night of unwinding and settle down.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Movie followed the children's story fairly well.  Enough imagination to keep it entertaining.  Child safe, not too bloody or violent.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and my daughter who is well versed in young adult literature. It was sad, sweet, heartbreaking and triumphant read. I would definitely recommend it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. It was like fifty shades meets Saturday Night Live. I can't believe it's in been in my &#34;to be read&#34; pile for so long.  The story you'd from his point of view was classic. I absolutely loved ever part of this book and all its characters. Hilarious and hot!! This is most definitely in my top 5. Emma Chase is an very talented writer as shown in all the fabulous reviews. I can't wait to get my hands on others by her!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great book. The author brings us another wonderful story telling of kvothes experiences with the most descriptive and captivating writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun, challenging, &amp; exciting! Would recommend this app to anyone who likes to challenge their brain. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
0307730697|5.0|Unbelievable courage and dedication. Well written and impossible to put it down. When most people would have quit Adam excelled. Such a wonderful wife to have stuck with him through thick and thin and support him through everything that he went through. Very inspirational story that I highly recommend to anyone desiring to serve our country. Adam exemplifies excellence in our military.
B0095P29EG|5.0|For fans of the Avengers, this is a required first step.  In addition, you need to watch the Iron Man series and Captain American.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|I purchased these DVDS for my grandson, they were movies his mom loved as a child. He loves them them too. So glad I found them.
B00AAKZPUK|5.0|This is one of Redford's best movies.  For first time watchers, it has plenty of twists and turns.  A great film to watch every few years.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game.  I also love the fact that I can stop<br />and pick up where I left off.  I would recommend<br />it to everyone.  I was intimidated at first but now<br />it's great.
B003B02OOG|4.0|This is a collection of John Grisham's short stories, all centering around Ford County.  While Ford County has been the set of some of his other major novels, I expected this to be a return to the location with slight links to A Time To Kill or other stories (a la Stephen King with Skeleton Crew).  Alas, it was not.  While my expectation was not met, the stories contained therein are sufficient in their own right, and kept me reading until I had polished this novel off in about a night.  Will I read it again?  Yes.  If it had been a choice between this one and another that I did not have?  Well, I would have preferred a full legal thriller to a series of minis.  In the end, I still recommend it.  If you're a Grisham fan, its more good reading.  If you're not, this is not the best starting place.  Pick up The Client or The Rainmaker or a Time to Kill.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Other than one time his name is dropped, the first 33% of the book is not about Tesla at all.  In fact, twice during that first 30+% I double checked to be sure I was reading the Tesla book and hadn't accidently opened another book on the kindle.  Then at 84% his story is over and the author is trying to sell you on his program.<br /><br />I was very disappointed.  The information about Tesla is interesting, but rather dryly delivered and couched in so much other extraneous information to be practically useless.<br /><br />It is a quick read and since it did give a basic overview of Tesla's life I give it 2 stars.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We loved every minute.  Looking forward to next season. We may buy the entire series in dvd, just to keep it.
0439023513|5.0|Mocking Jay was the perfect end to this series.  It is an easy read and very enjoyable.  Perfect for everyone.
B0016OOS16|5.0|very good<br />but i don't konw how use it on the pro/e<br />I see furture the leap motion is more popular
0441172717|4.0|Good read.  If science fiction is your thing you will enjoy it.  I am not, but I enjoyed it.  Again, it was really long but enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun challenging and you don't have to buy anything to continue the game<br />I am getting tired of free games that make you buy components to keep moving forward
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I was surprised I liked this book, it was a bit boring at times but beautifully written about a heart wrenching situation..
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun especially great for people who love horses but can't own one. I love this game!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, lots of puzzles and if you get stuck the walkthroughs don't reveal too much. Nice to pick at here and there. Really enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!!!! I don't know 1 person that hates this game! If you don't get this game, then u r probably a loser....
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Has great action, fun for whole family to watch, good action kept moving didn't have any long pauses.  Would recommend.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so addicting! Sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's really easy, and sometimes it's just normal! If u don't het this game, then u r CRAZY.
B006LR0XLM|1.0|I thought I bought it... but where is it?<br />Does it have to be this hard. I never have such issues with my ipad, iphone etc...
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I love it! :D the perfect teen romance book. If you a fan of teen wolf, you will love it just as much as I do. c: <3
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I want sure if this was already on the kindle so i downloaded it.  Haven't really had a chance to use it yet.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Good app. Customizable Hud is absolutely neccesary to enjoy.  Great presentation and physics, I was pleasantly surprised.  Still trying to find my ideal position for on screen control icons.  Other than that a worthy purchase.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I'm a baby boomer, and this was music I enjoyed years ago. I saw it on the Today show, and came right here to buy it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|but I decided to watch it on Prime and -- zingo-- I was equally hooked. Good writing. More than just two pretty faces.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|More buttons, good thumb stick, great software. Over kill for most games but for darkfall or wow, it's very necessary.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Expecting to be disappointed by a prequel to Silence Of The Lambs, I was shocked at how good this series is. I can't believe it is on broadcast TV - top notch, if very disturbing, entertainment.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Very interesting read! The photos are intriguing and Riggs tied them into the story in such a clever way. This book was fun and original, looking forward to the next one!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was just looking for a decent indie apocalyptic book to waste some time, but I ended up becoming completely engrossed in the characters, writing and story.  From the first line I knew something was different about this one.  The quality of the writing was way above some of the other stories I'd read and his ability to paint a picture really brought the scenes to life.  When I finished this short story all I wanted was to have more of it.  I was very happy to see he'd written two other books in the series at that time.  Since then it has grown into two complete novels and a third one coming soon.  I've read every book he's written and am anxiously waiting for more to read.  I can't recommend it or the author enough.
0738711500|5.0|These are my favorite deck of tarot cards. They do not have reversed effects to make it easy but are super accurate. It comes with a book giving the author's interpretations of the cards, various spreads, and some basic information and suggestions. It's really easy to understand. The art work is beautiful and I love the design on the back of the cards. I defiantly recommend this deck to anyone. Its perfect for beginners or those looking for &#34;the one&#34; deck.
B008KWTF2O|5.0|Definitely a great book that has taught me how to encourage my curls to be even curlier! Love how it has recipes for homemade products as well as information on what to look for on a label even though the author has a product line of her own. Great find!
1452101426|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the artwork of the movie. Fabulous. All the paintings and sketches would look great framed on my wall.
6305531412|5.0|I grew up watching this movie, it was always one of my childhood favorites and is still a favorite now that I am grown up.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|A movie that make you Feel the emotions, and make you think. It would be good to see the 1st movie Yossi before maybe seeing this one so you can see why Yossi is the way he is.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Wide variety of sounds available.  I love that I can combine sounds as I please and adjust the volume of each sound individually.  Once I'm satisfied, I can save the combination as a favorite if I choose to.  Or I can just use an individual sound.  With so many options, you can have a different sound (or combo) each night!
1451695195|5.0|I found this book an excellent guide to the after life. I sent it to my son in Hawaii and enjoyed our conversation.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|My (new) favorite sudoku game!  Easy to play, LOTS of games, many levels from very easy to nightmare.  Settings are customizable--I like to keep it in portrait mode. You can also set colors, hints, font size (helpful for older eyes!), etc.  I highly recommend--get it!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This record is the best Sabbath has done since The Mob Rules. I would say this is the best record Ozzy has been involved with since No More Tears.<br />That being said we have a fine 50 plus minutes of good tight sounding music and writing from Iommi and company in a long time!<br />I did not get the &#34; Deluxe Edition &#34;. If I should have or shouldn't have please provide feedback in the comments section and then I will decide if I should buy that edition as well. Your opinions would be greatly appreciated!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm a History Major with a concentration in British studies so Downton Abbey grabbed my attention from the very start. The depictions of the relationships between the aristocracy and the staff of the manor house is accurately depicted. Also, the episodes where the estate was taken over to serve the needs of injured recovering WWII soldiers was also right on.  I just read the biography of the Queen Mother and it confirmed that the writers of this series really did their homework.  I would love to see a new season.....my entire family is hooked.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I'm using this app on a Kindle Fire Tablet and it works great. Although it does not focus a beam as a flash light would, it does brighten up a considerable area to allow navigation as needed.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Pixar and the first 2 Toy Story movies. While this is not quite on the level of those, it is a wonderful addition to the canon, bright, colorful and great fun.
B0051YDTKS|5.0|As a longtime fan of anything I could find by Ozzy or Black Sabbath (minus the Dio years, because while Dio was amazing, he wasn't the right fit), I should've had this album wrapped in my grubby little arms on the way out of the womb.Several tracks, such as &#34;I Don't Know,&#34; &#34;Goodbye to Romance,&#34; &#34;Dee,&#34; &#34;No Bone Movies,&#34; &#34;Revelation (Mother Earth),&#34; &#34;Steal Away (The Night),&#34; and &#34;You Lookin' At Me Lookin' At You&#34; were entirely new to me, having only heard the major singles and the Scream album in regards to Ozzy's solo career. The album at large is really quite shocking, in that it's largely chilled-out, poppy, sixties-style stoner rock, far removed from the wicked reputation Ozzy has spun for himself as the Prince of Darkness and an unabashed corrupter of the young. Overall, though, it's an excellent album, the only true filler on the expanded edition being the Randy Rhoads outtake at the end. Strict fans of extreme metal may not be as impressed by this album than those of us who take in the history, range, and origins of metal, but let's face it: if you like Sabbath or other '80s-and-early-'90s-era Ozzy material, Blue &Ouml;yster Cult, Girlschool, Rainbow, and'or Blue Cheer, this album is a great buy.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not a bad game. It's pretty easy. I like that is a bit challenging. It's not a game I would have wanted to pay for.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So I had this book pre-ordered, have been waiting forever. I'm not so sure why everyone was so upset about this not being the end of the series, I'm pumped! I love this series. It has also been common knowledge for quite sometime that this would not be the last. I love the characters in this series, all of them, main and supporting. The series has an ensemble cast, which lends to the suspense. The supporting characters in this series breathe a bit more intrigue and angst to an already unbelievably complex story. Cary, Eva's Mom and Dad, Gideon's family, the exes... oh my. What a tangled web, the author weaves. I love the stage she is setting, for a mind blowing climax. Gideon and Eva are both incredibly damaged, and scarred. The thing is, I think this is why they work so well together. They know each others bad stuff and they love each other just the same. The stumbling point here for me is Eva. Gideon has proven himself over and over again, that he would do ANYTHING for Eva, and yet she still doubts. That being said, over the course of this book, she finally realizes, he is her's. I was in turmoil while reading, because the hits, they just kept coming. I mean this poor couple could not get a freaking break! The story continues to evolve, in my opinion. I think that in order for this story to be given justice, there will need to be more books. The story has progressed slowly, time wise, that is over the last three books, instead of time jumping like most. The author has kept the timeline, almost in real time, so by the end of this book, only months have passed, not years. I have read numerous series, where there are many books in the progression of the story. I love them because, I feel like the story is not being diluted, for the sake of wrapping up. The story line, is so complex from my view, that I cannot wait to see how it progresses. The issues within this story are many. Every character seems to have a dilemma, and an agenda. Just when you think you have it figured out, the rug gets ripped out from underneath you. Gideon has a very dark past, and I think that it won't be simple when all is revealed. I love the fact that we have two characters in this story that are trying to work past all the obstacles and insecurities in order to make it work. These things make this series, feel more real for me. I think that this is why, I enjoy reading the Crossfire books so much. The love story is there, the mystery and intrigue is there, the heartbreak and emotions are there. It's a total package, and does not belong strictly in one category. It checks all the boxes.<br /><br />I also want to note, that I do not think anyone who has not read a book, should be rating it! If you have read the book and did not enjoy it, that is fine and completely understandable. But judging and lowering the author's rating for the sake of being angry, because this was not the ending of the series, is cruel. Author's put their time, blood, sweat, tears into writing a novel, and writing negative reviews for the sake of being mean, and angry is not fair. Other readers come to amazon, read reviews and base their purchases on these reviews. When I sit down to write a review, it takes me some time, because I really need to think about what I'm saying and how I want it to be portrayed, received. Criticism is essential, however, I think that it should always have a pure purpose, not a malicious one. I would never write a review I did not feel to be true. To that end, I think that when making the decision, whether or not to read this series, go in with a clear mind.<br /><br />If you enjoy steamy reads, with a whole lot extra going on, then this series is for you. If you have not read the other books in this series, read them first, before reading Entwined With You. This is not a light, easy, breezy read. This series is dark in places and focuses on relationships, real, damaged, and enduring. I have loved this series, so far and I cannot wait to see where theauthor takes us next. I will read every single book in this series, and eagerly await more! Thanks to the author for bringing such an amazing story into the light.author takes us next. I will read every single book in this series, and eagerly await more! Thanks to the author for bringing such an amazing story into the light.
0778320448|5.0|I have enjoyed this book, this is one I will keep and maybe read again next year, but she has new series coming out soon.  Really enjoys her books.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book. I highly recommend it .Buy it now! You won't regret it. Enjoy enjoy!
B00821OX98|4.0|I love scifi & I love this show watch it beats lots of other stuff going on in the world of TV.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I love the detail in this book. Not only are the characters well written, the history is accurate, and the places they visit are real.
B00005JOHC|5.0|I love this show! It's original and the Charecters are great! If you love sitcoms like Friends and Seinfeld I would defiantly watch this!
B004PGAQMW|4.0|Great story and fun movie!  I liked it and it will be watched more than once.  The animation is not the greatest; but is good.  The story line is different and fun.
B001FB4VXU|1.0|TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful. I know some of you probably disagree with me, and that's OK. This is just my opinion.
B004CUVRF6|5.0|Yes!  It is that good!  I loved it!  I will watch it over and over again.  The animation and special effects are amazing.  The colors are brilliant.  The story is beautiful and touching.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is one of the best free apps I have ever owned. it is a fine example of fun gameplay and options for play. I would recommend this to all takers of all levels.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Kids watched it right away and loved it. I had seen it before and couldn't wait to own it. It is a great movie
B008220BLG|5.0|I love Zombieland and The Walking Dead, but I didn't expect Warm Bodies to be that great. However, once it was available on DVD I bought it immediately. It is a zombie love story, but not an overly sappy one. It is only PG-13 so there isn't a bunch of gore. It is definitely one of those movies that can be loved by both guys and girls.
0399226907|5.0|This is a classic. Wanted to read and enjoy this book with mt two new granddaughters. So far they love it!!!
B00969GFFU|2.0|I’m not sure I would have finished reading Freedom had it not been a book club pick (mine, not Oprah’s).  With one glaring exception, the majority of Franzen’s characters suffer through their respective chapters, behaving more like walking, talking literary symbols than people of any grit or substance, all ennui and human condition - the condition in this instance being the awesome burden of growing up white and middle class. It’s a theme that I mistook for a health dose of irony, all fun poking at our self-serious generation.  That was up until 150 or so pages later, when it dawned on me that A) Franzen’s playing it straight and B) I was suppose to buying into it.  Oh this burden of freedom, it’s responsibility a plague of guaranteed mysery and dissatisfaction!  Oh…. please.  No.<br /><br />This is not to say that I completely disliked Freedom.  The man can write an thought provoking and lyrical passage and for such a girthy tomb, it moves relatively fast, give or take the odd 10 page rant on the plight of the Peekynosed Knockneed Swallow (or whatever it was called). My main issue was just with such a large portion of the whole - hollow bodied characters as a mechanism to relate a very angry premise - that it left me cold.  Which is why it seems almost as if the author had his own change of heart somewhere along the line as well.  What else would explain the beautiful and completely unexpected redemption of the ending?  After 400 or so cringe-worthy pages, I’d go so far as to say it was emotional satisfying - much less a minor mercy, for the reader and the Berglunds.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe I’ll feel differently about it after I’ve had a little more time to reflect.  There are certainly enough people out there whom I respect writing reviews that declare it the Next Great American Novel.  I wonder in retrospect if there wasn’t some even bigger message that I missed, that I will come to understand and see the book differently once it’s settled in.<br /><br />And if that’s not a way to puss out on a review, I don’t know what is.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|It's 10 pm on Sunday night. I got a sample of this book on Saturday morning at 10 am. I couldn't put this down. Everybody should read a book like this once in a while. It is not great literature but who cares it is a simple and wonderful book.
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|No seriously, it's a spin of Romeo and Juliet. It had some laughs and it was pretty amusing overall; the wife rated it at four, I would have come in one less but I'm a guy and definitely not much of a &#34;zombie&#34; romantic.
B00785P2QC|5.0|The game is really fun and addicting its worth downloading. But it's a little annoying . When u have to get something but u need more money
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such  a great book. I thought it  was going to be one of those teen craze books and  it was but it kept me  on edge the entire time. It took me four days to read this book. And now  that in done can't wait to start the second on tomorrow!
B000OVLINI|4.0|Perhaps ultimately too structured in its plot, like many novels, this book was an absorbing and exciting read. Book group enjoyed it and it led to more discussion of the book itself than many of our reads.
B0010HA68I|4.0|I did not have the chance to use them a lot, but I thing they are pretty comfortable and very good quality.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|does nothing but put ads on the phone, would not allow it any space on my phone. removed after 1 test.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The characters in this story are so well developed that each story stands on its own. As the time continues you begin to see how their lives are woven together.  Heart wrenching sadness and joy of reunion fill this novel and in the end you see just how each life is a piece of the perfect puzzle.
B005V2S7FW|1.0|Why do all of these programs call themselves free when it should be free trial.  tell me its a trial before it gets installed
B004VMUS9G|3.0|This would be a better experience without the extra &quot;save&quot; button. Like that I can use my own music for alarms.
B008X9Z3UC|4.0|This case is just for what I was looking: inexpensive, simple and effective.  It is sufficiently grippy for carrying around, but a bit more slippery than I would have liked.  It is the proper dimensions for my Kindle.  The zippers work well, which isn't always the case with carrying sleeves.<br /><br />I would like to see two additions: (1) an inside or outside pocket for stuffing a couple of papers into (like receipts), and (2) perhaps a wrist cord so you could slip your hand through to give a little extra security when carrying this around.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Landay has written a remarkable book that won't allow the reader to put it down.  The emotional responses this book generates cover the entire spectrum.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game...graphics are top notch. It is not insanely hard but it does make you think. I enjoyed this game it is worth the price.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Wow! So much fun, very addictive! I would definitely download other games from this developer. There are a few things that are a little tricky, for example some of the colors are very similar and hard to differ (black and dark brown) but still an awesome game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book so fast the first time I missed a lot if details.  It's a bizzare read b/c it's about something so horrific, but the book allows the reader to move beyond what's happening and get sucked up into Katniss and her life, emotions, thinking,  and justification for her every move.  Great read!
1400049628|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this book, it made for a fun read and also enjoyed the information on building a stock pile of supplies for Zombies or other emergencies that may arise in todays society.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Sucks. Wont tell you what you have to do. I would rate it 0 * but you have to rate it at least 1 * so Ya... Do me a favor and save your memory!
1577314808|5.0|I loved the format of the book. The questions and answers format reinforced the central idea of living in the present. The author answered those questions every time in different ways. Thus, help the readers to grasp the concept of Now.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|it is an ok movie. Some of the visual effects are alrirght others are ...not that good but the movie is entertaining.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|We went to see this at a local theater out of boredom, and didn't really expect much because of the 3 star rating. At first I wasn't sure where it was going, and the acting seemed over-wrought. Thing is, this is not a retelling of The Wizard of Oz. It's more like a prequel, and it's a fantastic, whimsical, technicolor CGI adventure. The strained acting was part of the huckster carney act - completely intentional -- and it was wonderful to watch the character transform as the story evolvesd. The message at the end is intimate, profound, and something most of us can benefit from. It is, in some ways, an unlikely hero's odyssey. Let go of your expectations, turn off your inner nagging critic, and just go for the ride. I will watch this movie a second time; something I almost never do.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Loved the actors and the movie.  Sometimes those movie &#34;critics&#34; out there don't really know what the public likes. Great action, sometimes funny.  Inventive, you'll never see those kind of weapons anywhere.  Once you see it, you'll never look at Hansel and Gretel the same way again.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Great writing and story telling. Still relevant messages, no matter how much time has passed. I have watched the entire series multiple times, and being able to watch it whenever I want on Amazon instant video has been great.
B005PK57NU|4.0|The first two seasons of the show were riveting. Feel like the plot line is growing thin and not sure where they can take the show from here. Not sure I would pay to watch season 4
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Love the music! Cher and Christina do an awesome job both in the movie and singing the songs! The cd also shipped fast and was as described!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|Great Figure it is durable and poseable. It has 4 Hands 2 Heads and a lot of articulation. Be careful because this is not a toy for a kid below 12. Still a great figure. It's my favorite goku figure and dbz figure.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I am hooked on this game....like it better than Tetris....fun, colorful, challenging, entertaining, like the sounds, good for hand eye coordination..
B004UID2LC|2.0|At first the app was letting me watch whatever I want. But then it started not letting me watch any thing<br />I don't know what to do now
B0000026CN|5.0|I originally had only a cassette tape of Carlos's Blues for Salvador.  Now I can play it when I'm driving.  Rich passionate and rhythmic sounds plus what I call village sounds.  &#34;Bella&#34; is to die for!!  I heard this on one of the San Francisco stations and I went immediately to the local Tower store (now gone) and bought it.  The DJ said the lines lit up at the radio station when they played &#34;Bella&#34;!  Gorgeous and sensual!  Beautiful!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Good enough for me since its music i do mainly. And some movies once in a while.you have choice to download them as video, music, picture... YOU CANNOT VIEW THE VIDEO ON APP ONLY VIDEO COVER..
0812993357|4.0|I did not like Grace Coddington in the movie \\"The September Issue.\\"  In fact, I thought she was quite rude and whiny.<br /><br />But now I have read her memoir and I really loved the book and have a sincere appreciation for Grace.  She has lived her life<br />in and through fashion and she has been a stalwart and loyal journeywoman.<br /><br />I thank her for all the fascinating tidbits, but no nasty ones, about stylists, photographers, models, editors, etc., etc.<br />I got a really good look inside this world which I am so fascinated by.
B003VXQ0V6|5.0|I love the book, it was good to reread it as an adult.  I had a better understanding of the story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Super fun and addicting.. once you start it's hard to put down! Needed more levels.. can't wait for more! Must watch tutorial to begin paying
B009POHHR6|5.0|Great story. Good twist. Fun ending. Worth the price. Lex Luther was the best character and that rarely happens in a superman story.
B00CO52NLI|3.0|This was more than we wanted to get into.  We''re not into buying a lot of stuff for animated pets.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Best shoe ever. Its perfect quality, a great episode where many things are reveaed. Hey what do you think of season 4.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love google at all times.  It's much better than bing.  I'm always googling something that I just have to have an answer for.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love it . Best redneck game ever who needs roll bars . I recommend this game to anybody who loves off road motor sports.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's convenient when I need to search ebay.  I just don't shop there a lot.  It's definitely a good app to have.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The characters made you care about them, and they were real.  People weren't all beautiful and brilliant, and the family dynamics were wonderful and heartbreaking all at the same time.
B00827OXJ2|5.0|What's to be said about Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon other than they are fine actresses in their own right; together they are great. This team-up, turn around, suspenseful thriller is definitely worth watching and I'm sure you'll want to watch it more than one time. As a movie that had too little advertising I was surprised how good it actually was. It should have gotten more play than it did. You'll like it!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Important book, like all of Gladwell's books.  Look forward to next one, meanwhile I'm reading Howie Weener Unclogged: a colonic noir musical memoir.  I love this book, hilarious!  http://amzn.to/13js5B4
B005OP7162|5.0|One of the best shows on tv! Very Suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat the while time! Creative story lines all twisted together to make sense. Each episode is better than the one before!
B00005JMJG|5.0|great writing makes a great movie.  Next up:  Howie Weener Unclogged?  Hilarious novel with the charlie kaufman touch.  http://amzn.to/13js5B4  Hilarious novel, just waiting to be adapted!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is good not awesome  if your bored it is a good game to play but not a game to play all the time
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|I was so excited about this movie - not only was it someone other than Johnny Depp as the quirky, lead role, but it was interesting and classic subject matter as well.  Apparently these qualities do not add up to a grea film.  The acting fell far short of my expectations - mostly in part to the blatant miscasting in the movie.  I would have given it one star, but the scenery is both whimsical and beautiful - a true fantasyland!  So if you enjoy scenery in movies, watch it...otherwise, skip it!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I was so very pleasantly surprised by this book. I expected a light love story with a predictable ending. Instead it was a very touching ,sad and at the same time funny story. Definitely read this. You will grow to love the characters .
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|If you enjoy revisionist fairy tales turned action flicks like \\"Snow White and the Huntsman,\\" you'll like this one. It follows almost the same good vs. evil plot with a love story thrown in to keep everyone happy, except much better special effects. As a bonus, it's also well-acted. Nicholas Hoult plays Jack with an innocence and \\"every man\\" sort of heroism, and Ewan McGregor is almost unrecognizable as the head guard.  The grotesqueness of the giants - not just how they look, but the things that they do and eat (hint: 2 legs, 2 arms, walks upright, evolved from chimpanzees, rhymes with Neumann) - is worth the price of admission. To boot, you also get a decent storyline that changes the original \\"Jack and the beanstalk\\" story enough to feel original and so that a big budget, effects-filled blockbuster action movie can fit within the plot.  There's a little bit of campiness thrown in to show that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously...Ewan McGregor plays these parts just right, as does Stanley Tucci. It's an enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd give it 7/10.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The way it is written is amazing, the series is amazing, how it's described is amazing, and the characters are amazing
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's fun only when you're bored but other then that it's pretty stupid, to many pop ups and what not, so yea kinda stupid
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best book ever !!!!my favorite part was when he got locked  in the laundry room:).;) :) I am so happy!!!!!!!!=)=)=)
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling skies is a great tv series. I wouls recommend it to everyone who loves sifi. Watch this show now
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Must get it will blow your  mind but their is a low  glu credit bit over all it is a good game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super graphics. Realistic scenarios. My 8 year-old loves this game. Can't wait to see how far she can go in the training and competitions.
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I expected more He tried to re enact the George Smiley character and its not just the same. In my opinion this book is a marketing ploy by the publishers
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game could have been a bit more challenging, and definitely needs more levels.  I breezes through all ten just before going to sleep last night.  My seven year old got through the first two without help!
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|Why does a board game need to track my location? Is this some sort of sneaky way to spy on you?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|a clever variation on the hidden object game where you solve puzzles to escape from 10 rooms. hopefully the next 10 employ less hidden codes
B009IF82SK|5.0|I came to this party late in the game, only finding out about the show in the last few months, while traveling on the road, shooting and producing a cable television show.  On travel day, I often arrive in my hotel room in the late afternoon: tired and hungry.  When room service arrives, I flip on the TV and this show lands in front of me one day.  I've been hooked ever since.  I own all of the seasons on Amazon Instant Video.  I can't get enough of these characters.  They make me smile.  And bring me joy.  May the show go on for years and years to come.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Love the contemporary, believeable storyline and the characters.  Even the characters I didn't like (or felt distaste for) at beginning of series are now, as they become better known to me, appealing and I always anticipate who will do what next.  Highly recommend for those who like a good story, rather than fantasy, explosions and gory violence.
B007X2JV0S|5.0|This is a fantastic follow up to the series 1 soundtrack (which I also recommend).  David Arnold and Michael Price have masterfully composed new themes to intertwine with the already established themes from series 1.  Some of my personal favorite highlights from this soundtrack are &#34;Sherlocked&#34; and &#34;Prepared to do Anything.&#34;  That said however, each of the tracks are wonderful and not to be missed as there isn't a boring or overly repetitive track in the entire soundtrack.  If you're a fan of the series and you enjoy film/tv scores, you'll love this soundtrack.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I read Ford's The Sportswriter years ago and loved it.  Although Canada was even more highly raised and awarded than The Sportswriter, I did not find the book as captivating as the earlier one. A major theme of the book is the reinvention of the self as a former way of life becomes impossible, but neither the teenage boy central character nor his sister really succeeds in this effort. They are survivors of the trauma of losing their parents because of the parents being arrested and imprisoned for bank robbery.  My sense is that part of the teenager boy who survived this experience became numb and never recovered. As a character he is easy to sympathize with but hard to feel close to. He has learned to cope, but perhaps at  the price of being an observer of his own life.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Again Hosseini has enticed  us into the lives of a variety of Afghan people, and kept us mesmerised by their journey. Brilliant.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Cate Blanchett was excellent in this movie.  I highly recommend it if you are a period movie buff, like I am.
B00BQU12GE|5.0|Surprising how well this album sounds,any question that this music can't be played live is put to rest, and is now my favorite album of theirs, every songs is improved on.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's not the best book in the world, but it will definitely keep you engaged and feeling erotic about your own relationship.
1616551100|5.0|At first I found the art a little sloppy but I soon found out that the art simply creates the right atmosphere of foggy London and the likewise foggy moore. The adaption from the famous novel is faithful and elegant. I recommend this comic book to comic fans and Conan Doyle fans!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Decent plot with decent acting.  Not just another shoot-em-up, violent garbage movie with a none to limited story line.  You actually have to think a bit about this one and it has a couple of very interesting twists to it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A gift for our grandson which he has played at a friends house before. He loves the speed of the run and challenges.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie.  I need t know how the story is going to end.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Again it was a gift for our grandson. He found it okay to play but for him there was not enough action that kept his attention to completion of the game.
B00371XIP8|5.0|Love the Movie, Loved the first one and this one is even better. Edge of your seat action, very suspenseful, Sure to be a classic.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|It was fun but at times very frustrating having to add extra gems so that he could add more items to the island. Enjoyable, but it took more time to get the hang of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app was a fun way to burn a couple of hours. The puzzles were not so difficult as to be frustrating, but a couple of them were quite challenging, enough to keep me interested. Will definitely play when they provide more levels.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It was a gift for our 7 yr old grandson and he has had great fun playing the game. It did not seem overwhelming for him to catch on how to play.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a beautiful and captivating story of many interwoven lives. While I sometimes felt frustrated initially in beginning a new storyline, I was quickly sucked into the character and new perspective offered. A moving, passionate, beautifully written tear jerker.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|Amazing movie. I'd recommend this uncut version to get a feel for the nuances that might go overlooked in the directors cut. Nearly 5 hours of watching time, but I'd say worth every minute.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  I have to really discipline myself to spread the episodes out and not sit down for a full marathon.  Excellent acting and excellent script.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Better writing,  better acting, fewer models. Tatiana Maslany shows us what Joss Whedon's Dollhouse might've been with a genius thesp at its core.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|Shows videos of the exercises. Has a good mix of workouts and lets you pick if you want to isolate an area of the body or do it all. Nice app if you want to get in shape or help maintain.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I am a long time fan of Paulo Coelho and this book has been great as well as the others I've read. You have to read a chapter and let yourself dwell upon it for a little while, it is beautifully and simply written yet the profound thruths that the author is talking about are worth contemplating and need some time to sink in.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|All of the Ice Age movies are so good!  My daughter owns and watches all four movies.  It's her favorite series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've seen in a while.  The only negative I have about this show is that it's extremely difficult to stop watching once you've started.  Prepare to go through 3-4 episodes at a time minimum!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Loved the characterization and plot development and the detailed description of such an imaginative world...just wish that it were not for adults only.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|The plot sustains both tension and momentum, which I doubt is easy to do. The entire cast is very good and Tatiana Maslany is pretty terrific.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Would have given a five but sometimes it does have loading issues where it didn't register my last actions. Wish there was a save button. But it really is fun to play and advance. Also unlike other games I have played getting coins and cash is easy to do so it isn't frustrating feeling like you can't afford things. It is truly a free game.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This is a sweet romance. Travis & Abby are strong, smart young people who end up being friends and then turn to lovers. College life for these two are fun, active and they have lots of friends, just the way college should be. I rated it three stars because I felt the character of Travis was very aggressive when it came to Abby and she let him be that way. This isn't a book for young readers, because of Travis and his violent, possessive behavior<br />.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|The beats are adequate but don't build toward anything, thus resulting in a self-aggrandizing, hallow album. The tracks suffer mostly from Kanye's feeblest, most self-indulgent attempt as a rapper (I Am a God). The lazy lyrics on Yeezus will neither challenge nor impress anyone who has had sex more than once in their life, as Kanye drones on about this conquest or another, and how he has ultimately found his soulmate (presumably Kim Kardashian). Previous records by Kanye served plenty of ego (as all rap and hip hop artists do), but his earlier works were balanced out by lyrics that challenged social constructs. Skip it until it hits the $5 bin.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A masterpiece of movie making. The stories, the settings and the acting are first rate, A gem for discriminating audiences!
B00AAW1322|5.0|I wish you can get social distortion riffs like ball and chain and story of my life.it would really make my day
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Started playing this game thinking \\"It will be another download and trash game\\". Boy was I wrong! I can't put it down, as a matter of fact, this is taking me away from the game so I'm done. Back to playing!
B0020EK4QY|5.0|One of my favorite movies... I am looking forward to the Blu-ray version.  Harrison Ford is so good at intense action roles.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The characters in this novel are very real to the reader. Louisa grows in a way she never felt was possible. The emotions felt by the central characters are unimaginable in our everyday lives. One would not choose to be in their postion yet could not help but to feel the what they appear to be feeling.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This was a great read very emotional I cried and laughed! Excited to read book two now. Would recommend this book for sure.
1421550644|5.0|There is so much more to this story. The anime covered so little. I am so happy I made this purchase.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Love those Jack Reacher books! It's like reading about someone you know. I like the fact he's a good man trying to do the right thing. It's nice to see the good side win occasionally!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not quite what I expected! But was really fun. easy to understand and to play my thirteen year old enjoyed playing.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|This app is a pleasure to use.  It has a reserved section where you write. I really like that feature.  The GN 10.1 should have had that built into it's note apps, but it did not, l have not been able to find it. This is the reason I am giving this app 5 Stars.  Yes the note has the ability to enter your text hand written, but it converts it as typed, not hand written.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|And ending this brilliant story deserves. Read it trough under one week, couldn't stop reading, and now that I'm trough, I feel satisfied.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It required playing with FB and I have limited Internet minutes.  Big negative for me.  So I removed it from my tablet.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|It was ok. Filled an hour or two of my time, but it was way too short. It didn't have a lot of substance and the puzzles were average. Didn't have to use a lot of brain power. If you want a quick easy game, then this is it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Outstanding series.  Have recommended to various friends who also are now hooked.  Indeed, Masterpiece theater.  Anxiously awaiting season four to begin.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|Great album as always.  Excellent song writing and I love that they are still going strong after all these years.  Can't wait to see them in July!
0553582461|2.0|I really enjoyed this series, but the ending was so unrealistic. Fitz walks back into Molly's life too easily for me. I was so disappointed that Molly winds up with him when Burrach's body is barely cold. The fact that Fitz never grew up out of a young love infatuation was disturbing. The fact that Molly takes him back after seven children is difficult to believe. The ending marred the entire series because Fitz never grew up.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I started watching this movie and fell asleep about 20 minutes into it.  So, all I can say is the first 20 minutes were a little slow.  After that I have no idea.
B00174TKGI|3.0|Love the story line, great acting by Denzel Washington. There are some parts of the movie that I would have made different
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|The graphics are really good, but of course, it's Disney!  I really did not like the star in this one.
B001NA6096|1.0|Don't waste your time and money. Script is awful and boring. Dialogue absurd and juvenile. If I had a gun next to me I would kill my tv. Worse than before sunset
B0054SMID0|4.0|one of my favorite with Matthew McConaughey. Over all worth watching. Interesting plot and lots of chemistry within the whole cast.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|Don't waste your time and money. Script is awful and boring. Dialogue absurd and juvenile. If I had a gun next to me I would kill my tv
B003O86FMW|4.0|I find this book the best in the series! It was cleverly written and had just the right amount of everything you look for in a good book romance,suspense,violence, and adventure my age recommendation is about anyone 4th grade and up!
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I thought this was more of a chic-flick. It was pretty good, I thought there were some funny parts in it. Overall, the acting and the plot are good.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was the first time i bought anything off amazon besides an ebook, It actually works perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is brand new to me.it's awesome.I have too many complAments to give to the creators.greatness is what I think they should nickname it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I could not put this book down. I was interested from beginning to the end. I just could not get enough. The details in this book are absolutely fantastic. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone I know.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I have lots of problems getting anything to post. Get hacked,added friends I don't know or request, games I don't want etc..
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Didn't like it as much as watching the tv show.<br /><br />I enjoy 2 or 3 of the songs, but skip most of them - which<br />surprises me, as I really enjoyed the Public TV show.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Pretty good. Climax at the last few pages is really good.<br />4 stars because it doesn't get interesting until about halfway.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Good action, good plot and the acting is also of excellent quality. Too much dirty sex which sometimes give you the impression that you are watching a porno.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game with great graphics, it's really hard to get<br />Gems but you can race and take care of your horse, I think it's<br />A great game for horse lovers. Go Horse's
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|A really great prequel. True to the movie Wizard of Oz. Added some interesting characters. I hope there's more to follow. Probably for 8 year old and above. Technology depicted was interesting. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Didn't expect this app to work as good as it did! It's really easy to understand and it does just what it says.Great Job guys.
B004RUF03Q|5.0|re-mastering is great from original tracks, nice packing, and a great bonus dvd to boot!! bOTH CD & dvd QUALTY ARE EXCELLENT!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and I wouldn't trade this game for the world. This is my very most precious favorite game ever!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The book is fairly slow in the beginning but has quite a few climatic moments. I enjoyed the overall plot though would not want to reread it.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|It is as good as the last  time I heard it. What can I say? If you like the Beatles music then you will this. Reminds me of a psychedelic Sunday get together with friends and listening to cool tunes.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I liked this book, but a lot of the background  historical information took away from the fast pace of the action.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Excellent. As all their cd's are. A talented band which can entertain and puts their hearts into it. Really they are amazing. Listen to a cd. This one is excellent. See them in concert. It is well worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was lots of fun and required some level of thought as well. I highly recommend this game for all ages.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Cool seasonal. Love all so far. This series is well done with great actors, really cool scenes and bikes and as much drama as you can hope for. Some of the cuts are hilarious. This you will have to be the judge of. Me, I think it is well done and a very cool show.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I love this story.  It is so well done you would swear it really happened.  The author really knows how to paint pictures with words.
0634022296|5.0|Has the lyrics and the notes and I like this book. It was produced and written well and is of a decent quality.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|For free this was a good utility...Don't know if I would have paid for it. It does not really do much. Otherwise, it's ok.
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Amazon your instant streaming feature is like going to church, really! When i am feeling blue i can go to my movie library and select just the right movie to save my soul (just a figure of speech of course). Jane Austin's Sense and Sensibility is just that movie. The cast of British superstars makes this classic period movie so authentic, i find myself actually there. There are so many positive emotions through out this story of friendship, love, loyality and betrayal even the hardest of hearts finds life. After laughing and crying with the characters in this film, I am re-calibrated and re-purposed, ready to go at &#34;it&#34; again. Thank you Amazon for making my day!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|WOW!  This movie is a really great depiction of mental illness with added humor.  Cooper and Lawrence make a great pair in this movie.  The dancing, drama, and romance really make this movie a joy to watch!
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|I loved this love story.  Between the differences in time and their notes back to each other, I really enjoyed this movie thoroughly.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|As I often do, when a highly rated movie based on a novel is released, I read the novel first to compare the two forms of media. Though the film was beautiful, the novel is brilliant. Like the ocean currents, this story carries the reader into a magnificent tale where bravery, loss, understanding and acceptance are revealed with a mystical simplicity. A young man trapped in a small boat with a ferocious tiger, both of them out of their element, unable to guide their own direction, lost to the mercy of the tides. Eventually each must accept the other for what they are. This is what happens when writing becomes art, and the genre of fiction is raised to the height of its potential to explore the essence of life.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show!! But you need to start watching from the very first season!  The character development is very good even in the first season.  So often good shows take time to develop.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have played all the different escape games and this one, by far, is the best one I have played. The others would get so challenging that I just could not go further than a certain level, but this one kept it right on the line between challenging and impossible. I loved it!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next installment.  I love these characters.  Excellent portrayal of the deep emotion that these two share.
B0029LHW4U|2.0|This album falls short of prior Alice in Chains Albums. I was highly disappointed when I purchased this CD. I listened to it once and that was it.
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Star Trek ingenuity and future focus without any violence!  This is a great movie for young fans for whom the new movies are too dark or sexy.
B00000272N|5.0|Alice in Chains was at the top of their game with this release. If you don't have this one, what is your major malfunction?
0812982622|3.0|The subject of North Korea began to weigh heavily. It was unremittingly grim. There was fine writing, but time sequences became confusing. I probably should have tried harder, but couldn't wrap myself in it.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|Mkaes you want to be in Rome - Gorgeous scenery, Beautiful people, funny and  wonderful story.<br />One of Audrey Hepburn's best.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints, it was well written an entertaining finished it in just a couple of days...you will enjoy!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Nice British series with some very colorful characters that reside in a HUGE mansion on an ever larger estate.  Very primm and proper with good stories of all who live there, including the servants.  I find it easy to watch and very entertaining.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great product. Have enjoyed it so much.  Fast shipment also.  I have not enjoyed it as much a  downton abby but almost as much.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|great family movie with good characters and good plot -very enjoyable and well worth the time to watch it.  good values lesson too.
B00942G4UA|2.0|Only heard one side of the story. I was extremely disappointed. Very skeptical of the movie as it seemed to take promote its view with disgruntled workers.
B004IPPINW|4.0|This is a very good book. It is a fast read.  It is also very unsettling.  There are no good guys or bad guys.  Everyone is a shade of gray.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is worth every penny of our Prime membership to stream Seasons 1, 2, 3 of Downton Abbey.  We are happy to have figured out that Prime covers this service.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun!! Too bad there wasnt more of it!! Very chalenging and so thought provoking!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My husband fought WW11 but we did not know about WW1 from England's perspective.  It covered the history in a very personal way reminding us of our own decimation of the glorious South during the Civil War.  Times change.
1401923127|5.0|As a practicing Family Physician for the last 15 years, Dr. Lipton has hit the nail on the head!  If people would consider the power of thought as medicine, it would completely revolutionize the medical community!  This is the one book I look back to as a reference point that validates so many things I see clinically. This book will stand the test of time.<br /><br />Dr. Thomas Duncan<br /><br />DrThomasDuncan.com
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This app was fun but with only 10 levels you'll be finished in just a short time. It was a great puzzle game if your looking to waste a little time.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Now that it is all over, I feel like I am giving up an old and dear friend.  My compliments to Brandon on taking on a monumental task and giving us all the closure we wanted. Well done!  I eagerly await a proper interval before I start over and live the saga once again.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Too long and not funny.  This dragged and had lots of tacky--not wacky-- humor.  I turned it off before it finished.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|An interesting look at the foster care system with it's strengths and weaknesses, and shows how one person can make the difference for just one damaged child's life.  An interesting look also at the human spirit and the desire to love and be loved, and the difficulty to do so as a result of basic formative year deficiencies.
8876250441|4.0|The book was good and it had a nice plot. It was a lot like the other books, though. It wasn't too graphic during the honeymoon.  When my book arrived, some of the pages in the back were all folded. I'm not sure if that was because of shipping, but I know that I did not do that.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I have never played a game like this it is so addictive! I love to evolve my shark and there are so many kinds of fish. I have played it on a tablet an on a kindle fire and has great graphics on both you should try this game!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I love this book! It provides a practical system for building good habits while sharing success stories that stick with you.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I enjoyed the 3rd season, but I felt the first two were better. It felt slow and stagnant in the begin, but picked up toward the middle. I am not sure why they spent so much time on Mary and Matthew in the first two seasons, then finish off the 3rd season the way they did. Probably the most upsetting part of this season. All and all I still watched and enjoyed it, and will continue to watch the next season.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|After I fell in love with the movie, I had to get the soundtrack so I can have the music in the car with me.  It's especially great played real loud when in the car by myself. I especially like &#34;Empty Chairs and Empty Tables&#34;.  Very emotional.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I heard one song at a friends wedding and went to buy the whole album. My husband and I listen to constantly. I love their voices, and that they play so many instruments too.
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Although the singing is great, the music doesn't stand on its own alone well.  For this one I need to see the play while listening.  Hope they do a movie at some point.
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie when it came out, but it far exceeded my expectations. I ended up enjoying it more then the first one, and I like Kevin Bacon a lot. I bought this for my daughter, and now we have to watch the dance scenes over and over again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. love the brain tease. fun to play. can't wait for more levels. starts easy then makes you think more as you progress.
B007MAETA8|5.0|I own all John Mayer's albums and to me this is his best. He mixes so many different sound and instruments. I bought it for my parents too.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I have never watched the star trek shows or movies, but I still loved this movie. It's got action, love, and humor. I would definitely recommend this movie.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|great bunch of songs - there are more than one versions of this recording with the same - I have found two - they have subtlle differences but all are still good - 'specially ifn you are an Eagle' fan
B00CLD671A|5.0|I enjoy seeing the way of living in that time period. It is very political I can't decide if these issues were really faced in this time period or if they are being played up because of the issues faced in the united states with adultery and same sex attraction. Other then the political jargon it is great
0451197879|5.0|I like kings books and enjoyed this one a great suspense book. I will usually read all of Mr. kings books
0525953728|5.0|I love the perspective of this book. The training, the mission, the focus on the task at hand. True professionals.
1781162646|5.0|I read within two days as I said before I like Mr. kings style and his warped mine at time
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I had to finish it and find out what happens. Great characters, full of suspense.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is the best book I have read in many years! It is an amazing novel that will forever be a classic to me and many others! I received my copy as a gift and wasn't sure what I would think of it but at the first page I was instantly sucked into the world of Hazel Grace. I think everyone should get a chance to enjoy the inspirational novel by John Green.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great characters, full of suspense, keeps you guessing how it is all going to end.  I really enjoyed this book.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I knew a little of the history of this great man of science but this book brought out a lot more -- especially regarding his interaction with the giant, power-brokers of the day: Edison, of course, but J.P.Morgan, Carnegie, Westinghouse and others.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the way the author began by infusing the nature of being a creative genius into the follow-up chapters on Tesla himself. Right up front, he discussed many of the attributes of \\"special\\" people who step into certain roles in time & history. I like that. He concluded the book the same way - not so much with a mere discussion on Nikola Tesla but on genius in general.<br /><br />Overall, a good job, good effort at shedding more light on this incredible talent - a man who often-times the world barely understood his worth!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Downton is essentially a soap opera fantasy. It's not historically accurate in the least. It is, however, entertaining. The writing is flawed, however the acting is excellent, as are the costumes and sets. I think it's fine to enjoy this show but do not believe you're getting a window into an earlier age. In the attitudes of its characters, it's purely 21st Century.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like it.  There is a good variation of games.  There are a lot of new weapons.  You can spend a lot of time and have a lot fun.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|This book will hold your attention from the beginning.  Great book.  I'd read it twice. Makes want to read the sequel.
0765356147|5.0|I loved this series of three books. Couldn't put them down and would find myself looking at my watch in surprise at 3 in the morning. Great character development and plots. 10 star!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Like others who were disappointed with this movie, I love complex, sci-fi and/or Tom Hanks movies.  Cloud Atlas was simply too disjointed and abstract in the depth of the meaning to follow.  The link between actions and souls is unclear throughout.  The violence (the frequent, vicious violence) seems gratuitous.
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I also have been a fan for many years.I have every song he has done, except this album. His older recording were the best, a new Sinatra, but the albums and his duets are getting worse and worse. He HAS to get back to his roots or lose his fan base. There are so many good songs from the 40's and 50's why he or someone picked this bunch is beyond me. I hope he learns from his mistakes.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|Like the header says Not good. Not bad. I've definitely seen worse. Jennifer Lawrence is hot as usual. This movie wasn't a total waste but I would not watch it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It kept me interested from page 1. Now I can wait to see the movie. Looking forward to reading the 3rd book.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Like all the books of George Martin, this book contains fascinating stories.<br />They are humorous, original and slightlly but wonderfully absurd.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Beautifully cast, the story opens in the late 30s when Hitler has already set in motion his monsterous machine for war.  The rumblings of war get louder has life goes on as usual for all at the Belgravia household.  There is intrigue woven artfully into the storyline, family secrets, a few downright surprises and love unfolds in some pretty uncommon places.<br />The settings look like you are indeed right there in the late 30s with beautiful Art Deco sets, clothes, cars make the story foe alive! You will enjoy this show...I only wish there were more episodes to enjoy!
B00821OX98|2.0|The program appeared unrealistic. The plot appeared to be very poorly written. A lot of the scenes were contrived and implausible.
B000P0J024|5.0|Love that Roy. This is a good traveling CD for the car and to add to one's laptop. So glad I ordered it.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|This movie appears to recreate the problems of drug addiction in a realistic. The performances were great and the depiction of the time the film was made were terrific.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I loved this game even though it got frustrating sometime  it really gives you something to do and makes you think. I would recommend this game to anyone. I loved it so much. It was an awesome game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not like other floor lock games!  This has mini challenges within each room.  Multiple rooms sometimes on each floor to find codes and parts.  WOW I really love this GAME!  Worth it Free and worth it with a paid version!!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Foxx does a good job in this--maturity seems to fit him well. Nice action / adventure. good filming, and story line.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I'm addicted to this show.  The characters and the story lines are very interesting.  I've finally found a show that is well written and not &#34;dumbed down.&#34;  I empathize with and relate to  Alicia as she juggles family, work, and personal needs.  I can't get enough of these episodes.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|I started watching the television series prior to reading the books. After the infamous red wedding incident, I decided that I wanted to read up on the series. So far it's very interesting and well done. Switching the narrative between the different  characters allows the story to advance while giving a glimpse into motivations and thoughts. Although sometimes it does seem as if a particular characters chapter fails to advance the story at all. The world is well thought out  and detailed. The pacing is deliberate, but sometimes seems a bit slow. Looking forward to reading more in the series.
B0013D8LCW|1.0|IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THIS FILM HAD A STREAMING OPTION.<br /><br />AMAZON HINT, HINT!<br /><br />I HATE TO BUY FILMS:<br /><br />. A WASTE OF SPACE<br />. DUST COLLECTORS<br />. THEY RUIN THE ENVIRONMENT<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION THAT IN NO TIME AT ALL IT WILL BE OUTDATED-REMEMBER THE VHS ANYONE??<br /><br />PLEASE MAKE THIS MOVIE AVAILABLE FOR STREAMING.<br /><br />THANK YOU.
0375842209|5.0|I just loved this book. Given to me by one of my patients, as a nurse. I raced through it, and i will tell you not a dull page in it. beautiful beautiful. and belongs up there with the Baker's Daughter, and Sarah's key. all decent people should read this. sak66
0670813028|5.0|I needed to replace my copy of It in order to keep my Stephen King collection complete after giving my copy to a friend. The book came quickly and was in surprisingly good condition for what I paid for! This is one of those books that I have to read every couple years and I am very happy that the copy I received will withstand the years of wear that plan to give it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really like the hourly forecast, it's seemingly accurate and helps w/ planning activities. Don't really have much more to say. I like and recommend it.
B00AK57N00|3.0|fun for a small amount of time, it's just not my favorite game i have ever played before. try it
8866131105|3.0|I was overcharged over one dollar for this item.  Should have cost $18.72, but was charged TOTAL $19.76 with out any warning or explanation. No way to resolve this on Amazon. Plus with Amazon starting to charge sales tax as of July 1st, worth looking at other shopping methods. Was good while it lasted. Oh well. Time to move on.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|The concept is perfect. Its a classic. Doesn't sound like any album. Witty, lyrical and deep all in one album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really great game with challenging, but doable levels.  The puzzles were fun but not impossible to figure out.  Loved playing it.
B00555X8OA|4.0|I find it fascinating how we think we're in total control of our brains until you begin to explore deeper into human thinking. This book is a great conversation about how we think and perceive different scenarios and events in our life.<br /><br />However, it does move a tad slow for me. For a working professional in the psychology or philosophy field I'm sure its great! But in laymans terms, I think some of the ideas could be explained a but quicker and more simply.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Read this! It'll really help you be a much better person in life! Habits can define your fate! Make reading a habit! ;)
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|great! Highly Imaginative! No details are left out on this thrilling adventure..Please see it, but don't slumber, you will miss alot!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He tells really good stories.  I like reading about the history of the people he writes about.  He makes it very interesting and I learn a lot also.
B0014JKJJI|4.0|By using it in my restaurant, it's not 100% non-slippery. (Most aren't, but there are many brands that are)<br />Fits nice and the belt like thing that wraps your heels prevents your shoes from falling off... ever. So that's awesome.
B00D9T8Q3W|3.0|I have to admit, like a lot of other reviewers said, there is some 'unlikely' situations in David Baldacci's The Innocent.  However, it's fiction, and personally, I had no trouble suspending my disbelief for this story. I read for enjoyment, not to understand the 'reality' of the dark underside of US Intelligence Agencies. I loved the fourteen year old and Robbie's interaction with her.  And I loved the whole 'hero' winning in the end.  Was the writing great--well, I've read several other Baldacci's books, and this one seems to have lacked some editing.  But overall, I liked it and will be reading the next book in the series.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|Loved it! Just what I was looking for from this group.  Want to have all thier albums in my collection.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|loved the movie. great shape no scratches.  my sis loved it, it was the first time she had ever seen the movie
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characters in this series are wonderful.  Great story line.  We started watching the first episode and couldn't wait to see the nextr one.  So glad that it is returning for a third season on TV.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I got this a few years ago when the movie was making the rounds at the theaters and I missed it there. I just realized I hadn't reviewed it, and thought it might be of value. I will say in all honesty that if you are a die-hard cow/chicken/pig eater with a, \\"ain't nobody gonna tell me different!\\" mindset, no offense but just move on. I say that because you won't like what you see if you sit through this movie. It will disturb you, perhaps gross you out, and you will likely think that you wasted your money. But, if you are having doubts and concerns about what the big industrial food production machine is dumping down your gullet... if your health is suffering for no apparent reason and your weight is out of control, watch this, preferably more than once, and then tell me you're not affected. This movie does not necessarily advocate a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, but it does expose many of the hazards and--to be blunt--outright atrocities committed on other living things in the name of efficiency and price point and 'consumer demand'. Personally, it changed the way I eat, the way I view food and decide what to put in my mouth. It changed where I go out to eat and what I order when I get there. The movie motivated me to drop 30 pounds and generally focus on my health and who I give my money to. And it genuinely scared me when I learned the scale and tactics used by those who would prefer that I maintain the status quo and keep my mouth shut. It's a good movie, well made, and I do recommend it. 'Nuff said...
B004J64QSI|5.0|The entire production was great... hate to say it but Nick Jonas was the one weak link. He does have star power but didn't hold his own in terms of voice. The two encores led by Colm Wilkinson were amazing.. they literally take your breath away. And the guy from the original cast (Michael Ball), who plays the role that Nick Jonas plays on the DVD, brings tears and passion when he sings out \\"The time is here..I fight with him\\" meaning that he will stay at the barricade. The song that most moved me, however, was Drink with Me.. maybe partly because I do like to drink but largely because this a group of young idealists who KNOW they are going to die and Drink with Me is about drinking to the good times of the past and about the loneliness and the scary fact that they know they won't survive and yet still believe strongly that the fight must go on. The DVD is a masterpiece.. and I don't think Nick Jonas was bad... it was just not great casting. On the other hand he sang well, was respectful and didn't put himself out there as a star.. just tried to blend in which he did. Norm Lewis is wonderful and Ramin Karimloo is a revelation and has true star power! I would give this production six stars if that were a possibility. I agree that Alfie Boe was fantastic..but do listen to Colm Wilkinson in the encores.. WOW!!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|A classic!  Nothing more needs to be said, really, except Jane Austen is definitely one of my favourite authors and I never tire of her beautifully drawn word pictures of her contemporaries.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|excellent app. a lot of fun with continuous updates. highly recommended. looking forward to many more levels and vehicles. a+
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Forget the story, this is just fun. This is a movie all about entertaining and you might be surprised by a scene or two.
B000I9YV30|4.0|I thought the movie was very well done, and stayed true to the book for the most part. I think the bridge scene could have been more detailed but overall a pretty good movie.
0765325950|5.0|The ending of the best epic fantasy ever. And the ending is perfect as the whole story was. Climactic and anticlimactic at the same time. Logical, yet maybe not:) What you expected, but also what you didn't:) I think no one else was able to do all of that at the same time.<br />I am just sad that it is over, but honestly, I don't know if I was able to handle anymore sequels:))))
B003GDFQX4|5.0|40 years in and still a gripping thriller!  Detailed description of the 'real' French services included, to the point plot lines without reducing it to a staccato list if actions. Great story (of course).<br /><br />Can't believe it took me this long to pick up a copy.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I was expecting a typical rom com when my girlfriend and I reneted this, I could't have been more mistaken. Without giving anything away, this movie satisfies with a plot twist I didnt see coming. Well done J. lawerence and Brad Cooper.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|OK, this was not one of those movies that you clutch and grasp your pearls as it reveals the meaning of life or has you weeping from how touching it is. Was it a fun watch for a Friday night - heck yeah! CGI was pretty durn good, the casting was decent - Jeremy Renner did an unexpectedly good job in a lighter role - he is kind of an intense guy and he made it work perfectly for this show.<br /><br />Well, worth streaming for $3.99. It was one of those where I turned to the husband and said, &#34;That was fun&#34; instead of screaming at the TV to give me my $3.99 back. I recommend it, just go into it with an open mind and ready for a fun couple of hours of mind candy. Oh, parent alert - F-bombs, which were not really necessary. I think they could have left that out and this show would be great for older kids. Just my two bits and the producers did not call and ask my opinion, so what the heck.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the most enjoyable electronic solitude app that I have seen so far; who knows what the future holds in store for us gamers?
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the way in which the book was written.<br />The insight to the time was interesting and sometimes disturbing giving great emotion while reading.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I was skeptical at first with this series, but after watching a few episodes of season 1- I was hooked.  This season doesn't disappoint and is just as addictive as the first.  Perhaps one of the best dramas ever made.
B000000H4V|5.0|This record had a huge effect upon me as a writing musician. It took traditional thrash and blended it with Brazilian percussion, innovative guitar noise and even some acoustic music for good measure. The themes of social and corporate injustice still resonate throughout the world today. I can't say enough positive things about this record, other than - get it and you won't be disappointed!
B00AYM6JFO|1.0|This is Willie trying to emulate Rod Stewart, totally the worst collection of songs ever!  I will likely donate this to Goodwill rather than listen to it again
B000000H5K|5.0|There are thousands of metal bands all fighting for a little piece of attention, so how do you stand out? You go 'native' and blend the old and traditional with the new and the cutting edge. What you get is this record, which combines Brazilian and modern art percussion, heavy guitars and innovative use of effects, plus a sensibility you just don't get from all the latest Pro-Tools/sonic PhotoShop dime-a-dozen wannabes all trying to conform to the banker/record company sound. This record is just as likely to make you start a spontaneous pit as it is likely to make you paint your face all tribal and stalk out into the wilderness. If you've ever felt alienated by this disposable culture then you'll relate to the lyrics and if you've ever need some glorious noise to get your day going then this is the record for you! I bought the CD to replace the original version that I wore out on cassette. Yeah, it's THAT addictive...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Unfortunately,  the item isn't working well.  The second CD in this set has problems however, what I saw on the first CD was fantastic and I look forward to being able to see more. All of that said, Amazon is helping to resolve my problem.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|Loved the characters and the show, Hated it's short-livedness. I do think that they did a good job  of wrapping it up for fans.Definitely worth watching for any Sci-Fi Fans.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Tom plays a very real character in this series - a person that has issues, temper, compassion, etc and his supporting cast are really good for this series
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Myst like atmospheric puzzler, really enjoyed it. Wish it were longer. Great production all around, especially the music and sound effects. Hoping for a long followup game, i want more of this game!
0307744434|5.0|I loved this book.  It has such a great story with multiple twists and turns, it definitely keeps your attention and keeps you guessing.  It is a great story that is completely unlike most books on the market today.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|My other camera bag is full from my DSLR and its lenses. I needed a decent storage backpack for my Nikon 1 system, and this works well.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|best book I ever  read .You should realy  read it but the thing is I wish I knew what he looked like.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Love Richard Farnsworth and  Sissy they did a fine job in the movie. Was also something the family could watch together. Was so impressed with hid determination.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Both my 14 year old and five year old's love this game and keep going back to it for more...
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I have been an ebay customer/shopper/buyer/member for a very long time and they have great bargins (just like Amazon); so, when I saw this ebay app, I thought, yeah right...an app that will make my ebay shopping easier but sure enough, it did! Everything's is laid out, simple. Check on your bidding wars, see you purchase history, etc., it all right there. If you visit ebay at all, get this app!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app with plenty of features to keep you involved and engaged in reading and understanding the word of God.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|This is an intelligent and disturbing show. The changes make it fun for present day viewers and gives it a fresh twist.
1932735410|5.0|One of my friend suggested this book to me and it's all the way winner. Explains all the concepts required for PMP in the simplest way possible. Need not refer any other book if you have this one.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|best game ever great to past time you get suck in for so long prefect stragity game got to try expansions to
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  From start to finish, one of the best and uniquely told love stories I have ever seen.
B001DPDVE8|5.0|This movie continues where the TV series left off. If you like the series you'll like this movie. I thought it was good and kept me attention.
B00377V6J2|5.0|This Deluxe Edition of 'In Session' was purchased for a friend who literally worn out his previous copy of 'In Session.' He was been delighted with his new copy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Gets the old brain cells working cannot wait for more levels. This game is awesome for people of all ages. My grandson was also hooked.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It's a pretty great Hidden Puzzle game, the writing is a tad hokey and all but it's everything you want out of such a game. Splendid graphics, great engaging puzzles and environments to challenge you, an overall pleasing experience... until they want you to pay real money to play the full game. Then not so much. Though if I were to invest in a company for my Hidden Object gsmes, G5 is on the top of my list.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|This series is one of my all-time favorites!<br />But the first half of season 8 was different and not in a good way.<br />The second half made up for it, but I hope season 9 follows the<br />same path!
B000FCKC4C|3.0|Interesting but not a favourite.  I am glad I read it but it would not be one I would keep in my library or recommend to very many.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|While I was a bit disappointed that they decided to change the cover art, this is really a great package.  The BluRay audio is awesome.  Very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All the hype was not worth it.  I did not make it half way through.  if you have half a brain and respect yourself don't waster your money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games series.  I have read the series a few times and it still captures my heart every time.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I absolutely could not get off level 5. I'm not stupid, but I did become inpatient and deleted the game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I LOVED the Silver Linings Playbook!  It was a great book and I am ready to watch the movie.  You always gotta look for the silver lining in life.
1608871827|1.0|Touring the Bible Belt with my family's Southern Baptist Biblical Interpretive Dance Team last year caused me to miss most of my senior year. I ended up having to repeat it this year. Still not meeting all the requirements for graduation, I was supposed  to take both day and night school classes this summer.<br />I blame this book for being the cause of one of the classes I ended up failing. As a result, I will be obligated to repeat the class this fall when it becomes available.  This will put off my ability to tour with my family and to be honest, my sister and I had a duet lined up in Yiddish highlighting The Songs of Solomon found in the Old Testament and that upsets me.<br />For a final report this month I had to cover the 'ring of fire.' Knowing that the Pacific Rim directly tied into it, I cited most of this book in my bibliography as source material. It seemed like a win win for me and my Christian Science teacher Sister Pelosi.<br />Instead, she was outraged.<br />My findings of 'men unnaturally bonding with devil machines of destruction and ungodly creatures from hell were all an abomination before God' such as the tone of her passionate accusations.<br />The police were called and I had to meet  with a social worker.<br />In fact, I was expelled from the school for the summer. The Chaplain said I needed time to reevaluate my erroneous thought process.<br />The rest of my summer has been spent trying to earn extra money going door to door selling magazine subscriptions and working a homemade snow cone shack with my Snoopy Sno-cone Machine using ice cubes from Burger King and Kool-Aid for flavoring.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Pretty cool to have childhood icons turned warrior protectors!  Awesome twist!  Great for any age.  Loved the Easter Bunny Best!
B006MPKDD6|4.0|It was suitably complicated ; Bosch was his endearing, put- upon self with hang-ups!<br />Satisfactory relaxation reading. ... and the possibility of more to come as always!<br />J.D.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|You know the writings great and the casting is excellent. This is the second golden age of Television.And most of it is not the old major channel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not to hard and not to easy. Great game to pass the time with without having to play for hours to get somewhere.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Read as a book group recommendation.<br />Glad I did.  Very well written and interesting.  You will love this book, too.
0694003611|5.0|create a quite time before bedtime.  interaction with child and story.  illustrates the enjoyment in reading and bonding of child and parent.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|it's well packaged , and the subtle up-grades to the video make it great.<br />the clam-shell case is a bit tricky at first , but you get used to it.
034580404X|5.0|I was expecting a used set, and these books were brand new still in package.  I also wasn't expecting them to come as a boxed set, so I was surprised and extremely satisfied with my purchase.
B00BE97ONM|4.0|I couldn't put this one down. The characters were well developed and really interesting. I am not going to spoil it for you, but the ending has a twist I didn't see coming. Highly recommend you read this book.
0425263916|5.0|This book had me reeling and feeling for Eva as Gideon continued to drive her crazy.  This was a great second book in the quintet series.  My book was in fabulous condition!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a very fun game it makes you think.  this app has given my family hours of entertainment.  waiting for the update now.
0425263908|5.0|As soon as I got all three Crossfire books, I began reading the third book.  As soon as I finished, I started over from Book 1 and continued on.  These books are amazing, and I am anxious for the next 2.  All of my books were brand new, and I have NO complaints.
B00C0UHGLO|1.0|The purpose of this game has nothing to do with where I am playing. Why is it requesting my location?
0425263924|5.0|I was ecstatic to receive all 3 Crossfire books in the mail.  Having already read the first 2 books, Bared to You and Reflected in You, I was impatiently awaiting the third book.  Now after doing some research, I find out that Sylvia Day has been quoted in saying the Crossfire series is a QUINTET.  Will definitely be purchasing the next 2 books as well as I keep reading them over and over again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a great book for our whole family! We read it together in just a few days. \\"Auggie's\\" precepts will be with us a long time!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was a fun game. It was more challenging then I had expected. I wish there were more levels to play.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Typical Ivan, bumbling and doubting. I always liked the writer's style and she doesn't disappoint. Looking forward to a hopeful second book in a series.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|i love it. i always worry about dropping my kindle,but this protects it nicely. it also shipped really quickly. i say its a kindle fire owners must buy
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|I found this app hard to use. The directions were hard to understand. I could not read what was written afterwards.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I download it hoping another so-so game... But i am very satisfied with it<br />Nice graphics and sound. I always gonna hate the conversations between characters, but i can live with that...<br /><br />Totally recomendaded!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I was surprised by this book. The characters were sexy, hilarious and the scenes were extremely hot. I'd recomed it to those who have not read it yet!
B004V71CYQ|5.0|Great movie head of its time better than the remake Jeff bridges at his best and worth the money to watch
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|this game is fun. the frist time you play it but then it just gets BORING I would not recemnd this game to anybody
B007MC0IAG|5.0|This book is simply amazing. Anyone who like to understand reality should add this to his/her MUST READ list. Great work Richard Dawkins.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|World War Z is a social, political, and military commentary describing how various nations would respond (or not respond) to a global crisis...you just have to get past the zombie stuff.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Not a bad book. I liked it. I liked those stories and interviews quite interesting. I especially liked the last one. Go Bob the Titan.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|This book is insightful and interesting. But more than that, it's highly actionable. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to further their career.
B004YXE438|5.0|If you enjoy puzzle, this is truly a fun set.  I love the different levels and the pics are pretty
B003K1EYM6|5.0|It made photo uploads a snap on the go.  Totally worth it, i recommend it to anyone that is using a camera on the go.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|The film describes Cheney's role in exempting Fracking from the clean drinking water laws. By giving examples of problems in almost every state with significant drilling and by highlighting the dangers to the New York City watershed, the film suggests that fracking needs to be more tightly regulated. Muller's book Energy for Future Presidents gives a balanced view suggesting that the technical problems of recycling and containing the fracking fluid are solvable.
1451627297|5.0|11/22/63 is the 34th stand-alone novel by popular American author, Stephen King. This time, the master craftsman of storytelling turns his prodigious talents to time travel. In 2011, schoolteacher and budding novelist, Jake Epping is shown a portal into the past, into 1958, and convinced that he can change certain events: specifically, he is to prevent Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating President John Kennedy on 11/22/63. But as Jake makes his way from 1958 towards his goal, he finds that the past resists change, that the past is obdurate, and that every change has consequences. Fans of King's work will be pleased to pass through Derry, Maine just after the events of \\"It\\", and encounter some of that novel's protagonists. King's extensive research into the time period and the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination is apparent in every paragraph: the feel of the late fifties and early sixties is very convincing. Once the reader suspends disbelief about time travel, the rest of the novel is utterly believable and, despite the volume, eminently readable. King paints for the reader a very plausible picture of a nascent assassin. This novel has romance, nostalgia, humour, sadness and an exciting climax. King's main character is appealing and easy to identify with; the supporting characters, no less engaging. The plot is original and brilliantly executed. This is King at the top of his game: an excellent read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What an amazing series...I loved every cast member, even a few that were despicable.  It was so enthralling, I was sad that I actually caught up thru Season 3 (not on Amazon)..and now have to wait for the new season to begin.  Maggie Smith is, without a doubt, one of the greatest actors alive today.  The attention to detail during that time period is so authentic, it made me wish, in a way, to be able to live during that time.<br />I can't say enough about how wonderful this series is...and I can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|I read it for my book club.  The book moves too slowly and is not that interesting.  Some parts give too much information, other parts are just glimpses when you want to know more.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|Best part of this movie was trying to figure out both the underlying story, as well as trying to determine which actors were playing which roles.  Other than that, somewhat predictable - but we enjoyed the performances!  Loved Jim Broadbent!
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is one of my favorite authors.  This book is just as good al all of her other books.  Riveting, fascinating
B00915G6R6|5.0|this show is so fresh and witty. makes me allways laugh. cant wait for season 5, but we are far behind in europe. what a shame
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was too superficial for me.  I read it months ago and just remember that I was somewhat displeased with it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I liked this, not a lot of all that who's sleeping with who type stuff, I am really tired of all that garbage. Just a great start to a good invasion series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was really fun but it gets confusing if your not good at puzzles. qlll in all its a great game.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This is surely the best show on TV. The writing is first-rate, light-years above your standard series dialogue, the acting brings each character to life.  Each episode has an interesting premise.
1593272782|5.0|It's good to find a book about legos that is not just about buying a kit and following the directions! This book is about the wonder of legos and what you can make with the extra pieces we always have lying around!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I bought this for my 3.5 year old granddaughter to play. She was bored with it in 30 seconds. It is not for a child to play. The fact that they are always trying to get you to buy something is aggravating. I am going to see how far I can go before I delete it.
1593272790|5.0|It is fun to have a book that teaches children how to use their imaginations to build things and not just follow the rules and assembly a model from a kit.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|If you have seen Wicked you won't be as pleased with this but mostly it's good. The special effects were well done.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is more like it, except my finger gets in the way and i cant see where my little dude is. Do they make a stylist pen for this? After a week later, I will answer my own question. Yes they do! Ordered it, and actually won ONE game!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a dream cast not only of the best British actors but also of the best in music celebrations.  The film shows the need for music in life and life in music.  Michael Gambon and Billy Connolly were scene stealers in every scene.  Maggie Smith was perfect throughout.  And Pauline Collins as Cissy was a triumph in every respect including the raising of her hand to ask a question to the raising of her arms at the end of the film.  A total package of thought, intellect, and love.  Pathos, ethos, and logos all in one great cinematic effort.  Listening to the final song while reviewing the credits was a humbling and gratifying experience.  Bravos.
1455523542|2.0|It wasn't in brand new shape like the book dealer said. The binding was cracked in the middle and the pages where bent.
