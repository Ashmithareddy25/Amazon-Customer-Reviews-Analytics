0525950079|4.0|I enjoyed this more than Pillars.  I think I liked the characters better and there was a better synch between the town's activities and the political history of the time.  It does get a bit old when all the bad guys (not women for the most part in this book) are of the church, but it doesn't detract from the narrative.  I did like the portrayal of the Black Death.  None of us living today can fathom what that was like.  Entire towns were completely wiped out.  I did appreciate that the author showed that some areas of Europe were in the throes of the Renaissance while other areas were still very much medieval.  I think many folks think it all happened at once like some historical timeline.  It's very much an enjoyable read.
0143038419|1.0|It's such a shame that she decided to abandon her faith and go on a worldwide quest to find what she already had! crying about not wanting to be married anymore is like a spoiled child who doesn't get their way, but isn't that how a lot of women are starting to see motherhood and marriage? as a bore and a waste of time? marriage is honorable as having children is honorable.  Promiscuity and \\"finding yourself\\" seem to be the hot ticket these days! but it comes with a price - heartache and STDs.  Want to find yourself? just look in the mirror! travel the world by all means, but you won't FIND YOURSELF! I couldn't finish this book it was so irritating. I have traveled all over and been to India where I saw beautiful people with beautiful smiles but so many of them lived in wretched poverty.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles' major label debut is everything a music fan could want in an album - smart, sassy and thoughtful lyrics; catchy melodies; a strong and rich voice; great piano playing; and a tiny pinch of profanity.    I bought this album after I heard \\"Come Round Soon\\" and \\"Love Song\\" on the Internet.  I immediately tore open the wrapping and struggled with the casing stickers and jammed the cd into my car stereo.  I listened to the entire disc right there in my parked car.  It's one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.  I still listen to her nearly every day and the music still makes me feel everything I did when I first heard it.    Don't let this amazing release pass you by.
B000002GQG|5.0|Whilst no longer hip in the impressionable world of the rock music cognoscenti the Moody Blues have assembled a body of work over the years that would shame most modern day \\"great\\" groups.  \\"In Search of the Lost Chord\\", from 1968, is one of the best examples of their early work.  Psychedelic, melodic, with bucket loads of tasteful instruments & typically melodramatic lyrics, the essential elements of well crafted songs & tuneful vocalising is never lost sight of.  If you have a prejudice about this group borne of reading too many \\"expert\\" reviews, sign off now.  If, however, you enjoy the Moodies, or think you might, this is one that certainly will not disappoint.
0920668372|5.0|This book was one of my all time favorites as a child. This book is for children its not a literal piece of literature. My mom read it to me regularly and when I could read, I read it often. The story focuses on the parent child relationship not \\"other\\" relationships. It keeps It focused. young children don't think its so creepy because it is read to them during the time when they cant even imagine leaving there parents. By all means I find it a little creepy now when the book is broken down that way, however through the innocent eyes of a child I loved it.  Now I will share this book with my son!

B000002UB6|5.0|This original (like most originals) is much better than the remake.  Honestly, some Beatle stuff they should just leave alone and stop trying to make more money off us poor suckers.  I especially like the mixing of their voices along with the music, and the wonderful ending with John's voice (I think it's John) saying, \\"and I hope we pass the audition\\" is just too priceless, especially knowing it is the last release of their career.    Buy it with the knowledge you will enjoy every song.
1594489505|5.0|In 'A Thousand Splendid Suns', author Khaled Hosseini proves his bona fides as a story teller. [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]] was no fluke.<br /><br />'A Thousand Splendid Suns' uses the life stories of two women to tell the tragic tale of Afghanistan in the last three plus decades. The plight of Afghan women epitomizes what Aldous Huxley called \\"the descending road of modern history\\", although here it is the attempt to drag the world back to a perceived time of religous purity that tumbles the country. Hosseini sculpts a poignant and heart-breaking tale, if somewhat predictable at times.
0618154043|3.0|i was very happy with the turnaround on shipping, considering i elected to have the book shipped with amazon's free supersaver option.  unfortunately, the (hardcover) book arrived with the upper right corners of both the front and back covers smooshed, as if someone dropped it from a considerable height.  it is not bad enough to warrant all the hassle of trying to obtain a replacement, yet it is disappointing nonetheless.    therefore, the three start rating is for the condition in which the book arrived.  as for the content--well, it's tolkien.  and as much as I loved The Silmarillion (I daresay it is my favorite book of all time), I can't imagine that i will not thoroughly enjoy it as well.

Ahhhhhhh, Joni's back.   Listening to it the first time made me weep;  again, Joni's soul, voice and words sang deep, raw and real.  Cushioned in rhapsody.    In our world today we crave her depth.  In the past we merely needed it.      Please keep making art, Joni.  New choreography too!
B001152TL6|5.0|The plot is not meaningless as described above... It's what I would call non-linear American neo-expressionism. A jealous husband ends up killing his wife and is put on death row where he escapes into another world inside his own mind, a world where he is given another chance to start over.     Essentially, the very same fate befalls him. Lynch's finest work. Can't believe the only version available for the last decade was a pan and scan import. Better late than never though, right?
006112429X|4.0|[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]<br /><br />... twice about having kids.  Eva is an Armenian-American self-made businesswoman who is very competitive and very ambivalent about having children.  She wants to prove herself as a mommy, however, and her easy-going husband really wants a child.  So they end up having Kevin who is a psychopath almost from the moment of birth.  What makes him this way?  That's one of the fascinating mysteries of this harrowing book.  Told in letters from Eva to her absent husband after Kevin is jailed for a schoolyard mass-murder, this novel traces the destruction of Eva's wealthy, self-absorbed life.  I have to give this novel high marks for holding my attention at all:  I usually find the epistolary novel a complete bore.  But this book will keep you up late at night - either trying to finish, or just thinking about it.  Disturbing.  This novel won the Orange Prize for fiction by women.

0201721481|5.0|[[ASIN:0201721481 C++ Primer (4th Edition)]]<br /><br />I agree with Paul M. Dubuc and just for your all information I am a mechanical engineer and have just come to a need of good c++ programming at work. I have looked at few other beginner books out there but this one is better than all. It's really sad that most of the review pertain to 3rd edition which really sucked and even the LOOK INSIDE shows you the older edition. AMAZON please do something????<br /><br />Anyways the book is great, very organized and structured. Has  plenty of tips, practice code and question etc. Also, basics are covered in detail and with quality content. Glossary in chapter end as well as end of the books make it a real good quick reference once you are done reading it. It did get a bit overwhelming for me if you are almost at the end but thats because they are trying to summarize very lengthy topic into short chapters.<br /><br />Overall I would say worth every penny you spend on it !!
B00004XPPC|5.0|I haven't seen David Lean's award-winning \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" (1957) for so long that I forgot how great it is. It's not a conventional war film and therefore there's very little action; the \\"action\\" is mostly psychological. I remember watching it on TV a few times with my dad when I was about 7-12 years old and even then, with such little understanding of the world and its social workings, I was fascinated by the picture and knew it was great -- even then.<br /><br />THE PLOT: A platoon of British soldiers are brought to a Japanese POW camp in Burma during World War II to help build a strategic railway bridge over the River Kwai. The Jap Colonel in charge of the camp, Saito, insists that the British officers work along with the enlisted men. The British Colonel, Nicholson, stubbornly objects to this based on the Geneva Convention, a copy of which he carries around in his pocket. He insists that there are rules to be followed, even in war. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two. Ultimately Nicholson is put in charge of building the bridge, which he takes so much pride in he fails to see that he's aiding the enemy. Meanwhile, an American sailor, Shears, escapes the camp and later leads a group of Brits on a mission to destroy the bridge.<br /><br />Although Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, is a fascinating character -- an ultra-proper stiff-upper-lip Brit -- and certainly worthy of respect as far as his utter boldness goes, he's what my dad would call a \\"goon.\\" (My dad served during WWII and died in 1988). Nicholson is so infected by pride, stubbornness and a sense of superiority that he can't see the obvious. Yes, he's a realistic and fascinating character, but I find him to be a total moron who can't see the forest for the trees. It goes without saying that I can't relate to him at all.<br /><br />Colonel Saito, the Japanese commander of the camp, ultimately accepts that it's in his best interest to allow Nicholson to believe he's running the show in order to get the bridge built. This is obviously a struggle for Saito because he has pride as well; but he refuses to allow it to get in the way of fulfilling his mission. 'Let Nicholson build the bridge and believe he's in charge and superior,' he seems to figure, 'In reality he's my pawn and a pawn of the Japanese military machine.' (Others may interpret this scenario differently, likely suggesting that Saito is the loser in the test of wills, moping around in bewildered defeat throughout the rest of the picture, but that's not what's really going on IMHO).<br /><br />William Holden expertly plays Shears, the American who escapes the camp and comes back to attempt to destroy the bridge. He's the the character I relate to most. On the surface he appears completely selfish -- doing whatever he must to survive, including lying and bribing. Shears has lived with the madness of war the longest and naturally develops a sarcastic, anti-hero callousness to protect himself and survive with his sanity intact. Despite the negative, selfish vibe you get from Shears, he never loses his humanity. He refuses to become an inhuman machine like Nicholson or Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), the latter of whom leads the British mission to destroy the bridge.<br /><br />For example, as Warden and his party travel through the jungle Warden becomes injured and insists that the rest leave him behind to die, arguing that he would do precisely the same if anyone else was injured. Shears blows up at this point; he's seen enough of this idiotic machine-like do-or-die mentality. He yells, \\"You make me sick with your heroics! ... You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like gentlemen? How to die by the rules? When the only important thing is how to live like a human being!\\" As captivating as the first hour is with the psychological conflict between Nicholson and Saito, the remaining hour and 41 minutes is even more engaging as thetwo story lines develop and ultimately converge: Nicholson building the bridge and celebrating its completion, along with his now-comrade Saito, while Shears & Warden and their team travel to the bridge and attempt to implement it's destruction.<br /><br />I just saw the film the other day but hadn't seen it for 8 years or so and I actually forgot exactly how it ended, as far as who dies, etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any major details away; you've probably forgotten the details as well, that is, if you've even seen it before. In any event, the ending is brilliant and potent. The Allied doctor of the camp looks on in utter disbelief at the climatic results. \\"Madness... madness...\\" is all he can manage to mutter. Powerful.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is filmmaking of the highest order on every level. The Sri Lanka locations are breath-taking. The only negative I can muster is that parts of the score are understandably dated seeing as how it was released in 1957. But that whistling theme is hugely memorable, of course.<br /><br />I could probably write a book about all the great scenes, lines and points the film makes but I'd rather you discover (or re-discover) everything for yourself. There's so much depth here that you'll get something new with each viewing. It goes without saying that \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" is one of the best pictures ever made and one of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />Grade: Atwo story lines develop and ultimately converge: Nicholson building the bridge and celebrating its completion, along with his now-comrade Saito, while Shears & Warden and their team travel to the bridge and attempt to implement it's destruction.<br /><br />I just saw the film the other day but hadn't seen it for 8 years or so and I actually forgot exactly how it ended, as far as who dies, etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any major details away; you've probably forgotten the details as well, that is, if you've even seen it before.

B000EK76K8|5.0|This is a great product and is the best choice for connecting your MacBook or iMac to a digital screen.  As other reviewers have stated, be careful which DVI cable you are getting.  If you are connecting to an HDmi port, I recommend this cable: [[ASIN:B0007MWE1E Cables Unlimited, HDmi To Dvi-d Cable, 6ft]].  I currently use both to connect my MacBook to my 46\\" 1080p TV and the quality retention of the digital signal is truly striking.  Try Apple's QuickTime HD trailers if you're looking for a demo of the great picture quality.  My only complaint is the relatively high price, but then again, there isn't anything else out there that fits the specifications.  Remember, make sure the cable you're attaching is DVI-d and you'll save yourself some headache.

B000MTPAHW|4.0|This is a great film for Steve McQueen fans and if, like me, you did not already have a DVD of Bullitt and have an HD-DVD player, you might as well get this disk on Amazon's two-for-one offer since it's only $10, then. However, otherwise just get the DVD version as there is nothing the HD-DVD adds. This is an old movie and short of a Ted Turner style make-over, there is nothing that can be done to make it look better than the DVD version already does. The movie, in HD-DVD, is quite grainy and not sharp...just like on DVD.<br /><br />I rate it a five star for the movie and three star for the HD-DVD format and average to four starts.
0440238609|5.0|Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy is not for kids-- or, rather, they are not for those uninterested in being challenged, hugely entertained, and carried along on a metaphysical thrill-ride.  However, if you ARE, rejoice!  A friend of mine described this series as part fantasy, part science fiction-- but these books delve into the very substance and meaning of consciousness itself.  You will be transported to other worlds, inspired to trust in and cultivate your inner-nature, and kept company by a whole slew of vivid characters-- from armored polar bears to benevolent, ancient witches.  Our heroine, Lyra, comes from a world that is similar to-- but not quite-- our own.  Her Oxford has the \\"dreaming spires\\" of ours, but people there have their spirit/soul living close to them in animal form-- a daemon, who is friend, comfort, confidante.  We begin the journey with Lyra, and her daemon, Pan, eavesdropping on a presentation given at Oxford by her uncle, Lord Asriel--- a revelation that the world we know, and others, are in grave danger.  What follows is an adventure harking back to Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\", infused with the ecstatic mysticism of William Blake...  Sounds too lofty?  Trust me, it reads like a house a-fire.  I couldn't put these books down.  And now I find myself looking around for my next read-- and for where my leopard daemon has got to....

This collection is a great starting point for anybody interested in the music of this great talent. Is it complete? Of course not. No one disk could be. That shouldn't detract from the fact that this album is an amazing selection of music, great song after great song.    Yes, the emphasis is towards Marley's most accessible, popular songs ... but that's how it should be. Every fan will have their own favorites that they'd love to see on a disk like this, but for somebody just getting started with the music of this amazing man, it's hard to imagine a better starting place.

Lost is a completely addicting show that will make your eyeballs pop every time you watch it. Full of twists and turns, you'll probably be pulling your hair out trying to figure out what comes next, as well as me.  If you liked the first season you'll like this one.

B000NQPZCO|5.0|The transfer quality of the catalog release is outstanding for a 10 year old movie that many people overlook, and the 5.1 PCM track combined with this crisp video makes an amazing presentation. All catalog releases should look this good, and the movie itself is nothing to sneeze at, with a performance from Pacino that makes you both feel for him and want to hit him at the same time.  Depp pulls off a subtle and nuanced character that is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum from Jack Sparrow, slowly showing Pistone's life fall apart piece by piece as he is forced to juggle his marriage and job.

B00005JPTI|4.0|If you are planning on watching this movie, I'd suggest you not read this comment*****<br /><br />I knew this movie had to be similar to a zombie movie, or vampire movie, because from watching the previews before I saw it in theatres, I knew the main character had to fear something other then just wild animals that escaped from the local zoo. I really liked this movie, I think Will Smith did a superb job, I think the death scene should have been a little bit less added special effects. I was so confused at the beginning, and everything was totally unexpected, which made it even better. I like how the infected were different, they had no hair, and they didn't eat people, like they do in zombie films. I don't understand that, I mean what disease would make someone want to eat other people? Even humans with rabies don't attack other humans, they just experience muscle spasms in the throat that effect breathing. They also experience: pain, itching, seizures, paralysis, hallucinations, and eventually death, so I just don't see the link there. The infected in this movie weren't dead as compared to vampires or zombies, they were simply mutated humans, with intense rabie-like sypmtons. I still think the ending sucked, but overall it was a great movie.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|A superb piece!!! Delicate and beautifully done!!! I have followed Celine's voice for many years now as she alone has lifted me to the heavens. This album is a splendid body of work with her native voice at its finest.  As if one is listening to the strings.     If you love 'The French Album' and 'On Ne Change Pas' ... do purchase this. These three albums alone were worth the wait for her gifts are majestic in French. Thank you Celine for you will never know what your music has done for me. I listen to the voice yet my heart hears the notes...you are an angel and an instrument from above.    A woman fully embraced.     Bravo Celine... A standing ovation!!!
B001152TL6|5.0|Finally this great film is coming to DVD. The Canadian import just did not do the film justice, hopefully, this \\"real\\" version does. I can finally add this great film to my collection! If you like David Lynch's work, especially perhaps his film Mulholland Drive, definitely check this one out.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|-  First of all, The story or History - well, I don't think the King Of Spain, Filipe II, wich was also, at the time, the King Of Portugal (the Portuguese throne gave him the command of the high seas - so, much of the ships were Portuguese caravelas), was only concerned with the Queen of England - it's ridiculous. And surely isn't as diabolical as showed. He made war against England not only because of the protestant position of Elizabeth BUT the fact that England's piracy were robbing ships and Spanish colonies with the Queen's consentment and not respecting the treaty causing economic conflict. Plus, Filipe was one of the most intelligent and powerfull men in the world.  -  The only good thing in this movie is - as everyone knows - Cate Blanchet. Samantha Morton was also good in her role as Mary, Queen of Scots. I agree with most of the people. The first film was much better - the dialogues, intrigue, menace, all great, memorable sometimes. And with a grand finale! This movie, Elizabeth - The Golden Age lacks a good screenplay, intensity - Some lines are unbelievable dull. It looks like a soap-opera sometimes. Very bad supporting actors like the young Bess! Even Rush isn't as good as he was on the first chapter. But with such discrepancies it could have been a good film, but it fails mainly because of the heavy handed Kapur.  -
0142004413|5.0|Not many adults ever reminisce about their childhood dreams. Those who do, generally label these as wishful thinking and sigh them away. Rarer are those who live lives of fulfilled dreams. Gerald Durrell, an eminent author, naturalist and expeditionist, was one of those uncommon individuals whose life's entirety was one long childhood dream come true. \\"My Family & Other Animals\\" is his most famous work, and is the first of his Corfu Trilogy.    The kid Gerald Durrell, or Gerry, was eight years old when his family moved from England to the Greek island of Corfu. Through the eyes of the young, fauna-loving and ever-inquisitive Gerry, Corfu seems to be the strangest place on Earth, and all humans, whether inhabitants of Corfu or not, appear to be strange people. The book describes Gerry's meticulous observations and detailed experiences in Corfu amongst dogs, cats, toads, snakes, scorpions, owls, magpies, gulls and other creatures he keeps as pets in his house, and his family members who are bemused as well as troubled by Gerry's love for these animals and insects. Young Gerry's mother and siblings stay engrossed in their own worlds, leaving Gerry alone to spend his days as he wishes, free from burdens such as going to school and being nagged by elders. Thus begins Gerry's exploration of Corfu, starting with the garden in his villa, and eventually his domain of knowledge crosses over to the neighboring islands.    The book will make you roar with laughter right from the preface itself. Descriptions of animals are unconventionally funny. Humans also are not spared. Imagine an entire family changing residence from one villa to another, just because one of them foolishly invited his friends so many that they would not fit in the current villa. After animals and humans, the third elaborately portrayed element is nature. Detailed descriptions of fig trees and setting suns create a Wordsworthian aura. Once Gerry sets on describing some of these, he can be drawn back only bysome exquisitely crafted squirrel or a raucously howling dog.    The best way to savor the book is to read it over several sittings, by allowing the excessive laughter to brighten many a dull day. An enlightening perspective of the work can be seen through Gerry's eyes. Animals, unlike humans, know exactly what they want. They are easier to please and easier to be understood. Most importantly, animals are easily befriended and are almost always loyal. When the book ends, it feels as if an intimate and jocular friend has left you forever.    \\"My Family & Other Animals\\" is a beautiful comedy, and is highly recommendable for reading by people of all ages.    [...]
B000VI70WM|1.0|I wasn't sure if I was allowed to not give any stars as my rating, so that is my intention--NO STARS. (of course I HAD to pick one star at the least!)    Let me first start by saying that I am deeply saddened. I don't know if I am more sad about wasting my hard-earned money on this album or for the reason that Duran Duran's songwriting capability has FINALLY begun to sink to an all-time low. I am a huge fan and have stuck with them through EVERYTHING; all of the break-ups and the changes in musicians and style.     However, I am finding it hard to appreciate the musicianship or the style of this album, probably because I can't find any. It is flat, one-dimensional, dead and unfeeling. It is absent of the LIFE I love in their music!     I never thought that I would be so disappointed in something Duran Duran has put out. LIBERTY was bad enough...but this takes the cake. At least LIBERTY had a measure of creativity to it.    When they tour to promote this album, you'll only be hearing one song from this album... Falling Down...(need I say more?)
B000VNMMR0|3.0|Bruce Willis brings his A game to this movie and it's one of the summer's better shows. Nobody can take it and dish it out better than Bruce Willis. Of the 4 movies in the series, I'd rate this one a strong #2. Yes, it's over the top non-stop action, but no one goes to see these shows expecting another Masterpiece Theater production of a Jane Austin novel. The stunts are the thing and this movie abounds in them. Bruce and his computer geek boy wonder work surprisingly well together. The only thing that keeps the movie from all time action film classic status is a fairly lackluster performance from Tim Olyphant, suprisingly so for fans of Deadwood. To make John's heroics truely meaningful he must have the proper foil, a worthy enemy. Alas, Tim is no Alan Rickman, who really made the first film so memorable. Neither Tim nor the script writers did anything unique or especially interesting with the character. Otherwise, I would have given this at least 4 in the genre.
B000000XCA|3.0|It's not without shortcomings, but Creedence Clearwater Revival's second album does contain two undeniable masterpieces: \\"Proud Mary\\" is one of the most beautifully evocative slices of Americana ever created, a wistful classic whose rolling rhythm and stirring melody are among the great additions to the rock `n' roll vocabulary. \\"Born On The Bayou,\\" meanwhile, is a heaving backwoods hillbilly country-soul-punk anthem, with a pummeling guitar attack and vocals that drip with raw menace and pure aggression. Too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound like those two.    On its other five songs, Bayou Country concerns itself with long, aimless jams (\\"Keep On Chooglin',\\" \\"Graveyard Train\\") and half-formed musical ideas (A cover of \\"Good Golly Miss Molly,\\" while entertaining, is also by numbers and unoriginal. It certainly won't replace Little Richard's epochal version). John Fogerty's songwriting, although obviously full of potential, was still developing at this point. In less than a year, he'd be filling albums with masterpieces like \\"Green River\\" and \\"Bad Moon Rising,\\" but on this album he hadn't yet come to terms with his muse. As such, \\"Penthouse Pauper\\" and \\"Bootleg\\" are decent numbers, but they only hint at the brilliance he would soon achieve.     Overall, this is a decent album, with several good moments and two stone-cold classics. CCR fans should enjoy this.
B00004R7TP|5.0|\\"Hounds of Love\\" is simply one of the best albums of the 1980s.     After having spent time with members of Pink Floyd (she was \\"discovered\\" by David Gilmour and sang backing vocals on \\"The Wall\\") and with Peter Gabriel (backing vocals on his 3rd album), Kate Bush came into maturity with \\"Hounds of Love.\\" In fact, many have made comparisons with this album and both Pink Floyd and Gabriel.     The album was well received and rightly so -- eventually knocking Madonna's \\"Like a Virgin\\" off the top of the UK charts. The songs are well produced, intelligently written and contains songs that resonate well with both \\"pop\\" and \\"progressive rock\\" fans. The first half, entitled \\"The Hounds of Love\\", offers songs about love that any of which could have made a worthy single. The album's second half, \\"The Ninth Wave\\", is an eerie collection of songs that loosely tells a story of a woman lost at sea and in danger of drowning.     In the original lineup of songs, there are no poor moments. Recent re-releases include extra tracks that, while good, are not of the same outstanding caliper as the original offerings. Still, these extra tracks should not discourage anyone from giving this a listen or two or three...
0143038419|5.0|Everything about this book is perfection. The story. The lessons. The writing. Especially the writing. I've never read a pleasure book more than twice and can't believe that on the fifth read I was still discovering nuggets missed on readings one, two, three and four.<br /><br />BTW, if you want follow-up on what happens to her and the folks discussed AFTER the book, go to \\"Blog.EatPrayLoveFans.com\\" for the Eat Pray Love fan news blog.  Packed with info.
0866118713|3.0|I bought this book because my own copy was severely damaged after years of peruse. The picture of the cover was not available online at that time. I was sorely disappointed when the book arrived and I realised that this is not Jane Austen's original novel, but a severely butchered version, probably adequate for 8 year olds.<br /><br />So, should you be looking for a present for a child, this is probably an excellent choice. Should you be looking for a cheap copy of the master novel, search further.
B000001EPB|5.0|the music is hot, and the taps make it hotter, if you get the video, or dvd, it is much better... irish music at its best...
0385520298|4.0|In spite (or maybe because) of the deliberately bad English throughout the beginning of the novel, this book is very well-written. Guo has a talent for creating life-like characters and her pacing is solid. The story focuses on \\"Z,\\" a 23 year old Chinese woman on a study abroad trip in England. Soon after she moves to the U.K., she meets her lover, \\"You.\\" I generally hate when authors speak to a \\"you,\\" as it can often be a clunky literary technique, but Guo does it well.<br /><br />The reason I give this book four stars rather than five (after all the good things mentioned above) is that I really didn't like the characters. \\"Z\\" is a spunky girl, but she is very dependent on her lover to give her a sense of identity. I can understand her need for security since living in a foreign country can amplify all the lonely feelings we carry inside, but I just can't really like a character who puts her all into her lover, especially when he doesn't reciprocate...it seems self-loathing. And her lover is no better. He's wishy-washy, likes to argue in circles and seems passive aggressive. I wanted to shake both of them! So if I had to rate this book, I'd give it 5 stars for the author's writing and the novel's artistry, but 3 stars for how much I enjoyed the book.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I've had this cd since it came out in mid October, and since then this cd has gone with me on every drive and anywhere i go.  Album opener Ties that Bind is the perfect song to let the listener know what he's in for, straight forward epic rock.      My fav tracks are all of them but stand out tracks are:    Brand New Start, Buried Alive, Blackbird, One by One, White Knuckles, and Wayward One  I would suggest buying the disc with the 3 bonus songs cuz the song The Damage Done is simply fantastic..    Mark Tremonti's guitar playing on this cd is mind blowing. he takes his craft very serious and is the best rock guitarist out there right now.  Myles, Scott, and Brian follow suit and as a band simply have tons of talent.      IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS CD WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  I WOULD BUY THIS CD  OVER AND OVER AGAIN IF I LOST IT OR IT EVEN HAS A SCRATCH ON IT..
B000N6TX1I|4.0|If you have lived life, traveled at all, and seen more than a sheltered 100 mile radius you will feel the message of this film.  It has a message, but that is not the beauty within it. You will be changed, you will see someone in this film who makes decisions in a crisis like you do. A montage of characters in a desperate world, and how they react when given a glimpse of the hope of a future. Which one are you?<br /><br />If you're looking for an action film, there is some here, but it'll disappoint you, there is too much depth here and even some homage to classic characters.  It also has a story that is found in older or foreign films, you are not spoon fed each plot point like most films of late. Some details are even left deliberately ambiguous for you to imagine what has happened or will happen after they make their choice.  This film expects you to think.<br /><br />Overall I thought it well executed, and a cinematographic treat.  The war zones reminded me of my time served in Serbia, desperate fights of normal people against armored might.  The urban shrug of a terrorist bombing, showing both laissez faire and resilience of humans in real adversity... at a cost of inner empathy.<br /><br />If you want action, other films will server you better.  If you want a political drama or blade runner future, this is not it. It has a piece of all of those, but the future setting is not the focus, just a vehicle.  Like Casablanca and others of it's variety, you will see a myriad of personality types in a unique situation, and the results of their decisions. Who is right and who is wrong depends on your point of view, but you'll come away wondering what you would do.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Wow. You could call this overkill or OCD in action but Warner has assembled the ultimate edition of \\"Blade Runner\\" for its anniversary. Many others have noted what's included here so I'll comment on them briefly and then address image quality, etc.<br /><br />This is the only place on regular DVD to get ALL versions of the movie and documentary plus extras. The Blu-ray and HD-DVD however are available with all of this but the toys and case. There is also a two disc set that includes the Final Cut and the documentary Dangerous Days as well as a four disc edition that has everything BUT the work print version of the film.<br /><br />Here's the run down:<br /><br />1) The original theatrical release from 1982 unaltered.<br />2) The \\"International Release\\" again unaltered.<br />3) The \\"Director's Cut\\" released in the 90's and the only version available on DVD until now in the United States.<br />All three of these are on a single seamlessly branching disc where you select which version you want to watch. That's good news for those who love the original theatrical release with the narration, those that grew used to watching the international version which is exactly the same except for two minutes of extended violence. It was this version that showed up on home video. The \\"Director's Cut\\" shares more in common than differences between the other two with the narration missing and the happy ending as well as some minor trims here and there.<br /><br />4) \\"The Final Cut\\" is on disc one of the set. This edition which has many tweaks including the cleaning up of continuity errors that Scott would have fixed if he had the time back in the 90's and 80's  (and the money to do so). This includes digitally removed the cable that hoists the Spinners, removing a bruise from Harrison Ford's face when the fight with Leon was placed AFTER Zora's killing (dramatically it made sense to put it after but it was originally before Zora's killing), replacing the stunt woman's face with Joanna Cassidy's so it looks good (Cassidy would have done the stunt if she had been asked but this is the next best thing since, again, if fixes a major glaring error), the ORIGINAL Unicorn scene shot for the movie but left out of the final version restored to the film and various other minor tweaks, a brief clip of the infamous scene of the dancing girls wearing the hockey masks.<br /><br />5) The famous \\"Workprint\\" version that differs signficantly in some areas including a different opening title sequence and other minor differences. Although this isn't the \\"Director's Cut\\" version, its showing at a film festival is what prompted Scott and Warner to go back and create the \\"Director's Cut\\". This edition looks the worst of the five versions of the film presented here simply because the source material always looked much grainier and never looked as pristine as the final cut. The opening titles on this edition are completely different and there are other differences as well that fans will pick up.<br /><br />6)\\"Dangerous Days\\" (the title of the original screenplay)a full length 3 hour documentary on the trials and tribulations that Scott, Harrison Ford and the rest of the cast and crew went through to make \\"Blade Runner\\". This documentary is very fair balanced and covers the very conception of the film when Hampton Fancher optioned Dick's novel, interested producer Michael Deeley to Scott's involvement. It does skirt over the involvement and interest of other directors (and there were a few). Scott initially passed on the project and was set to direct Dino DeLaurentiis production of \\"Dune\\" until his older brother died. After that, he decided he didn't want to spent all the pre-production time on \\"Dune\\" and re-evaluated his priorities jumping on the project but also demanding rewrites from Fancher and eventually bringing in writer David Peoples (\\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Soldier\\"--which interestingly enough is what Peoples calls \\"an indirect\\" sequel to \\"Blade Runner\\" set in the sameuniverse). Writer Paul Sammon (who provides a commentary track for \\"Blade Runner\\")wrote an excellent book that covers much of the same ground and appears discussing various aspects of production--this is essentially that book in documentary form.<br /><br />Various toys including a Spinner and a Unicorn along with other cool collectable are in a nice little box that resembles the brief case that Deckard carries around the Voight-Kaumpf machine in. Fans of the film will probably want this edition but those who just want the movies may want to pick up the Blu-ray, HD-DVD five disc editions or, if you're willing to NOT have the workprint version, the four disc edition on DVD.<br /><br />Image quality is stellar. The film has never looked this good in any of its incarnations. Personally, I would go for the high definition Blu-ray or HD-DVD since both have all the film versions plus the documentary without the toys unless you want the collectable case, etc. I've never seen \\"Blade Runner\\" looking this crisp.

Disc four has the \\"Enhancement Archives\\" which includes documentaries on writer Philip K.

B000UZ4EP2|5.0|I have been listening her sound (Clannad, Maire Brennan) for several years  this CD brings her back to previous age (after Clannad)  just listened once, the sound is pretty smooth and relaxing like flowing water  btw, she has been with 3 record companies in 5 years (Atlantic, Universal, and now Capitol), it seems Capitol would like to bring her old sound back, and it's just right  I give 98/100  very relaxing and smooth
0736063684|4.0|I have several copies of this book because I keep loaning to people who keep it forever!  A great resource...a must have to go along with Strength Training Anatomy for Women, which focuses primarily on lower body.  This one, however, covers the gamut.  Definitely worth it.
B00003CXA6|4.0|I won't spend a huge amount of time describing the story beyond saying that this film tells the horrific saga of the American Civil War Battle of Gettysburg where thousands of Americans on both sides were slaughtered. This was the final turning point of the war, the Confederates getting decimated by the Federals at this tragic 1863 battle.<br /><br />Here are some things I really liked about the film:<br /><br />1. The widescreen cinematography and settings are all nothing short of  superb.<br /><br />2. The film-maker pretty much stuck to the truth of how events transpired.<br /><br />3. I expected to be bored with a huge chunk of historical wallpaper building up to the actual battle -- this did NOT happen and the action commences almost right away.<br /><br />4. The considerable length of this epic film allowed for good story development, but at the same time, did not result in making the film drag at any point.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to comment that Martin Sheen manifested the weak link in this otherwise fine movie. He grossly over-acted his central role and, in the end, one comes away thinking that Robert E. Lee was a half-crazy and demented old man, well-past his prime as a Commanding General. You likewise end up embracing a false sense that Lee was the SOLE cause that the Rebels endured a drubbing at Gettysburg while, in truth, there were multiple additional factors affecting the final outcome. Part of this is the fault of the screenwriters but part is also linked to Sheen's tainted portrayal of Lee. Since Sheen played such a major role in the film, for me at least, his poor acting dragged this excellent film down from five stars to four.<br /><br />In every other instance, as far as the actors are concerned, I felt that everyone played his role to near-perfection. Also, the little summary at the end of the film which relates what happened to the principal real combatants was a great way of ending the movie.<br /><br />To summarize, if you are at all a fan of either war films, or of Civil War trivia, you'll certainly not be disappointed in the overall excellent quality of \\"Gettysburg\\".ainly not be disappointed in the overall excellent quality of \\"Gettysburg\\".
B00069YDXU|4.0|It's a great DVD with great sound. There are a few reasons why some idiots gave it 1 star: The lighting is plain (because it's the Montreux Festival and the stage and lights are not just for ELP), they're older (that seems to matter to some people), and I think some say the audio is bad because the synth tone on Tiger In The Spotlight is bad (just for that song, synths make many different tones if you don't know) and they use that song for the menu, so it's the first thing you see and hear, so the idiots say \\"the whole show is bad\\" when the audio is great. Emerson's playing on the first few songs isnt quite as tight as it could be on certain parts, but he really gets into the groove after the first few songs and plays great for the rest of the show. Lake's bass playing and voice sound great. Palmer's drumming is great, as always. All around, the show is great and the performances of  Tarkus, Pictures, Fanfare, Rondo, are nothing short of amazing. I've seen ELP in in the 70's and still listen to recordings from that time, the energy is different on this DVD, but not less (as some say) and this performance has great energy. It's sad that some people may not buy this great DVD because of some bad reviews at the top of the page
B000UBMZ4S|4.0|First of all, I have to say this is probably one of the top 3 best looking HD DVDs that I have played so far. The video transfer is absolutely gorgeous. The sound is also top notch. One of the problems that plagued the VHS version is the terrible video transfer because it's such a dark movie(in terms of lighting). The HD DVD version brings out every line of detail and lighting contrast.  If you prefer the original Theatrical version with the Harrison Ford Narration, that version is also in high definition and included in this set. There are a total of 5 discs in this set. 3 of the discs are HD DVDs, and 2 are standard DVDs. The different versions of the film are on the High Definition discs, and the supplemental material are standard DVDs. If you've never seen this film before, now is the best time, because it's never looked better visually. However,  keep in mind it's a bit slower paced and more story driven than most fast paced sci-fi movies. So don't expect any big Hollywood explosions.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I've never seen Blade Runner look this great, I remember buying the Blade Runner DVD before I bought a DVD player way back when, and I used it as my reference disc for purchasing a DVD player. I would do this today but I've allready bought an HD DVD player and OMG, this is one visual movie.    The auido is equally superb although I can only enjoy the DD track because I don't have the needed Hardware for DD True.    Final thoughts are on the aweful acting throughout this movie, its really that bad once you can point out the stitching in the actor's clothes. Also within the case is an advisory to upgrade your player's firmware. This isn't a bad thing but it's begining to get annoying that every other month or so I need to update my players firmware. This is a poor christmas present as it might not play right out of the packaging.    If you give this as a gift, be sure to burn your friend a firmware upgrade disc for their HD DVD player as well.
0375842209|5.0|This was one of my favorites from all of last year's books.  It is extremely insightful and deals with a terrifying topic with grace and honesty.  Although it is written for young adults it makes no attempt to hide the pain or gruesome nature of the Jewish experience.  I just bought it for several people on my Christmas list and highly recommend this book.
6304401736|5.0|I don't agree with those reviewers who write that this version should not have been made.<br />Of course the 1961 Disney animated version was an alltime classic, but this version compliments it rather than competes with it.<br /><br />If anybody could fill the role of Cruella De Vil coming from animation to life, it is Glenn Close.<br />If you watch this version and then the 1961 animated version you would think that the animation of Cruella De Vil was drawn from a photograph of Glenn Close acting the role.<br /><br />Cruella's biting bitchiness is memorable when she first meets Anita's (Joely Richardson) husband Roger (Jeff Daniels.<br />Of course the main stars of the show are the dog actresses and actors.<br />Poignant moments where the dog's actions and expressions are just too appealing and moving, include when they have though that Pongo and Perdita's 15th pup is dead, and Pongo's expression, and then his nudging of the puppy before it is brought to life.<br />And then of course the beautiful reunion of Pongo and Perdita with the puppies.<br />All the animal parts where splendid.<br />Make sure if you have pet dogs, to watch with them.

0143038419|4.0|I really liked this book, despite my distinctly un-spiritual envy of Elizabeth Gilbert's opportunity to travel the world.  This book does what good memoirs do -- allow you to live vicariously through the author's experiences.  This book is beautifully written, highly accessible, and somewhat unique in its exploration of both the sensual and spiritual quest of a woman in crisis who become transformed.  Very hopeful for anyone who wonders if their own life can be changed.  Well, it's a bestseller, so apparently my feeling of identification is shared by many other women... Can't wait to see where she goes from here.  Kudos.
0061020680|5.0|Terry Pratchett has become one of the most popular authors alive today and his popularity is richly deserved. But not even with his fertile mind could he ever have envisaged the heights to which his Discworld series would rise. This book first published in 1987 is the third of the Discworld novels and the author is really getting into his stride in the series that broke all records and continues to do so with new books  being regularly published.    Pratchett's wit and imagination are second to none. Who else would have or could have thought of the Discworld, a world of mystery and magic sitting on the back of four elephants, who in turn are standing on the back of the great turtle A'tuin the whole lot journeying through an eternal void. Are you with the plot so far?    Mort is the fourth book in the Discworld series and encompasses Terry Pratchett's thoughts on death. Surely death is a very serious and not least, final event. Can death be funny? Well, when it gets the Pratchett treatment you may well laugh yourself to death.    Mort is like many teenagers, spotty and growing out of his clothes too quickly. His parents had always said get yourself a trade son, and you won't go far wrong. So Mort does just that, as apprentice to Death himself. The problem is that  although he is willing enough, well reasonably willing, he is not very good at his job and bungles more than one fatal visitation.    Having said that  taking on an apprentice and delegating a lot of his work has changed Death's `life' completely, if you see what I mean. Drinking and gambling are just two of the human traits that begin to interest Death. He even begins to look into why fun is fun. It could only happen on the Discworld and if you miss it, you will be sorry . . .

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I just watched Sunshine last night, and I had the most wonderful time.  It was brilliant to see everything going wrong in just the most perfect way!<br /><br />The movie centers around a charming but awkward 7-year-old who wants to compete for a beauty pageant for Little Miss Sunshine.  It contrasts the jaded enthusiasm of the little girl's grandfather with the somewhat cynical aggressive optimism of her father, and the frank cynicism of her half-brother, who has taken a vow of silence.  The movie also contrasts the despair of the silent brother with that of the suicidal uncle (who is under very close supervision, for a possible repeat attempt; no sharp objects allowed).<br /><br />The young actress, Miss Breslin, is so natural that it hardly seems acting.  (A lot of movies work beautifully with almost no acting by the actors, and this one is an example.  There's plenty of time for Abigail Breslin to learn to portray the fact that she IS acting, to impress the critics.)  She is so utterly a seven-year-old being a seven-year-old that I could have cried!  The way she bounces up and down when she's excited is worth it all, at least for me!<br /><br />It's tempting to look for morals in this movie.  I don't think there are any really big messages; in any case, you just can't do it in a movie; you can only portray the consequences of certain kinds of actions, and even then, you just know that luck and random chance play a large role.  What appeals to me in this movie are those odd moments when even the most obnoxious characters set their self-interest aside, even if temporarily.<br /><br />I didn't think the dance routine at the pageant was particularly funny, but then I know the movie wasn't made for me personally.  (I've known that for several hours, now.)  I can see how it could be hilarious for some people, and I did find myself chuckling.<br /><br />The cast was very strong, the writing was excellent, and this movie deserves every good thing it receives.  And I wish all the actors, especially the younger ones, lots of continued success.<br /><br />Archones, lots of continued success.    Arch
B000O1799U|4.0|I do give props to Jennifer Hudson for her performance whose voice is very strong in this movie and carries Effie quite well.  I wouldn't have thought to nominate her for an Oscar, but she did well, and I'm glad she got it.  It wasn't because she is a brilliant actress, it was because for a girl who got kicked off American Idol, she had a brilliant voice that was finally revealed.  It is definitely Tony quality, but since it was in a movie, it's Oscar worthy.  Secondly, for a newcomer to acting, her enthusiasm was decent.  Dreamgirls is entertaining, dazzling, well-editted and well-put together.  But no wonder it didn't receive Best Picture.  It doesn't have the depth of Ray or the Grab-them-by-the-heart-strings sense that a Best Picture film should have.    Despite not being nominated,  I though Beyonce, Jamie Foxx and Danny Glover did a great job as well.  This movie should have won at least for editting and costumes.
1400064287|5.0|This was, for me, a couldn't-put-it-down sort of book. Written in such an easy-to-read style, this book invited me to take out my yellow highlighter; I'll be going back to review the many fine ideas I found there.
B000X1Z0BU|2.0|I am one of many people who have been changed by the movie \\"Once.\\"  I saw the movie several times in the theater and I know the soundtrack in and out.  I was also fortunate enough to see the Swell season three times here in Chicago.  I am a musician and I appreciate the sincerity of the film and the way the songs told the story.      I just purchased the Once DVD(U.S. Version - NTSC), and the experience was ruined due to the fact that the movie seemed to be playing back slower than normal making all of the songs play in a lower key, and all of the actor's voices lower than normal.  I am not sure if this was noticed at the authoring house, but the final DVD is not true to the original recording.  I tried the DVD in several different players, and even returned the first DVD but still had the same result with the replacement.  I'm sure that many people will notice this right away.  I also didn't like the airbrushed hand holding that was added and retouched on the DVD cover.    I still love the film, but the DVD is not a good reproduction.
B000UR9T8W|5.0|First of all, I am not reviewing each movie by itself, if that was the case I would not be awarding it a 5 star rating.  The reason why it gets 5 stars is for the following reasons:    1. Price is a steal for 3 dvds (even if you own 1 of the movies this is still a better bargain than buying separately)  2. The 1st and 2nd movies are worth buying this set (both of which can cost you around $30)  3. Each dvd has a bonus dvd  4. It comes with a box to hold all 3 dvds    Note: I awarded 2 stars for the 1st reason if you were wondering why I gave it 5 stars    Conclusion: If you are a fan of the series and do not own any of the dvds, this is the set to get.  Even if you own at least 1 of the movies already, getting this set will save you from purchasing the dvds separately.
B00005Q66Y|5.0|Interestingly, timing of each movement of this awe-inspiring recording by Wand is almost idential to Karajan's 1957 EMI stereo recording, another powerful recording of the 8th played by BPO. But from the very bold opening Wand's determination to dig even deeper into soul of the music and to soar even higher to the transcendent is obvious. The only weakness in this performance may be the less emphatic ending which loses tention at the last moment, while Karajan manages to close the symphony with decisive force. The recording quality is amazingly vivid and present. They should have left ovation at the end. Must have been monumental event!

B00006I53S|5.0|This is the only lens I use. It works great, very fast and pictures are very sharp with the image stabilization. An excellent lens for everyday usage, lots of versatility, good in low light conditions.<br />UPDATE... 4 years later..<br />I went with the L lenses (24-70 and 70-200 at approx $3000 total) and yes they are top of the line. This 28-135 went on the shelf for about the last year while using the L's. I want the new Canon G1x coming out soon for $800 and have sold my L's as the G1x has near L IQ. This 28-135 lens is back on my T3i and I had forgotten just how good this lens is, its not L quality but you have to really pixel peek to see much difference. If you have the bucks get the L's but for the difference in prices I think most will love this 28-135, I sure do.

B0002KPIQY|3.0|Watching this film, I was reminded of another Angelina Jolie starrer - \\"Beyond Borders\\", which remains her greatest screen performance. Then I compared the two performances and discovered why I couldn't 'connect' with Gia. Granted, the real Gia was quite a wild-child, but Angelina is not for one second convincing as a bisexual supermodel in this over-the-top dramatic TV Movie.<br /><br />I think the worst part is the actual narrative. No points for the script here. The end, which should have been touching, is instead cloying and demanding of our sympathy, which I felt was a bit cheap. Also, Angelina comes across only as Angelina in almost every frame of this film. I think this was the curse of being early in her career, but seriously, it was very clear to me while watching this that Jolie had absolutely no idea of how to be an actress or how to emote.<br /><br />Also, Gia was supposed to be a skinny supermodel, but Angelina here is slightly on the heavier side. Did anyone else notice this? Especially in that nude scene where she is having that morning conversation with her lesbian lover. I was left wondering why exactly people thought THAT body was all so exciting, because frankly it looked like everywoman. Not bad, just not spectacular.<br /><br />\\"Gia\\"'s primary strengths come when Angelina lets her guard down a bit (which is rarely). The picture suffers due to Jolie, because she is supposed to be in every scene of it. To such an extent, that almost everyone else is reduced to the part of a pathetic walk-on. They also tried to give this film an early 1980s vibe that absolutely did not work, plus Jolie's hideous hairstyles only made me disrespect the filmmakers even more.<br /><br />I am giving this a generous three stars, because I believe the true story of Gia deserved to be told. She was thrown out of the fashion world, and cut off even by close friends. Angelina conveys nothing of the mental anguish here, and by the end its hard to feel sorry for her because ten minutes of her all teary was much more than I could tolerate.<br /><br />Watch this, but be forewarned. If you're an Angie fan, you have to watch this as it did bring her much critical acclaim at the time, and actually launched her into Hollywood. Judged on more unbiased scales though, the film comes off as a fluff-piece without much soul.uch more than I could tolerate.     Watch this, but be forewarned.

B000I2J6K0|2.0|My wife thought this would be a useful video after viewing an interview with Erin and her husband on television.  I found this to be fast-paced and much more advanced than what we were expecting.  If you are a hard-core aerobics junkie then this must be designed for you--I am not pregnant and I found the pace painful to even watch; oh, and the partner portion of the video is perfect for those that need more than their own weight to use during aerobics. Erin's husband provides more resistance by leaning on top of his wife through the exercises, as if being pregnant was not enough.     I am sure Erin means well. However, for a normal person, you may need to watch the video at half-speed to keep up.  James Denton seemed as bewildered as I, but it was cool to see another puzzled husband accomodating his wife. He did his best going through with the exercises, so kudos to him for supporting his energetic wife in this enterprise.
B00000JG41|5.0|As a very fond fan of all that is Mike Patton, I am deeply in love with this cd. After the very lackluster, lazy effort that is Disco Volante, this more than makes up for any prior ill feelings. It is hard for me to find any complaints here for those who like their music from the \\"out of the ordinary\\" category. As noted in many other reviews, the music tempo and patterns change constantly but usually in a very clever, pleasing direction. Songs like \\"Goodbye Sober Day\\" go from a mellow, jazzy harmony to hypnotic chanting, then comes a bit of thrash metal and back to the mellow harmony of the intro...and it works, it really works. My favorite songs are \\"None Of Them Knew They Were Robots\\" \\"Goodbye Sober Day\\" and \\"Retrovertigo\\", but there really is no bad song to be found here. For anyone even remotely familiar with prior releases by Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Fantomas, Peeping Tom, etc., I cannot comprehend how you would not enjoy this rare treasure in your music vault. It should be noted this type of music is not for everyone, most certainly not for anyone who is only used to radio friendly song structure, i.e. MTV. This type of music is an art of merging constantly changing song structures that somehow form addictive harmonies. The sad news is Mike Patton has noted Mr. Bungle seems to have disbanded in recent years which would be a shame as this group of musicians proved they mastered their musical talents on \\"California\\". If this truly is the last Mr. Bungle release then what a way to go out!

B000Y7U98C|2.0|Sunshine needed a monologue before it decides to assume the mental capacity of the viewer. It lacked that and jumps straight into the film without giving an account of what's going on. Like everyone else, I would like to think of myself as a man of above average intelligence, however, there were many a times while watching this film that I felt that a lot of things weren't explained. Sunshine truly doesn't deserve the celebration it got, not to me. And I don't think it was because I started watching this is at midnight, it just for varied reasons, didn't manage to explain itself that well. The film was also a little eerie but I never quite understood who's making the sacrifices and when. The movie just felt short of being taken quite seriously.
0783240236|5.0|Technically, this one is a massive collaborative effort planned out by the great field general, ah, director, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is doubtful until Cameron's Titanic that any film ever attempted a more complicated assault, and Hitch had no computer effects.  His artists inked in the fabulous backgrounds when needed, a ridiculously difficult melding of negatives and ozone outlines and gives us a believable fantasy that holds up to this day.    This would be Hitch's finest effort, but the script itself is a little too 1963ish cheese.  The romance is contrived and not very believable.  The meeting of Tipi and Rod Taylor in the pet shop is pure schlock.  Still, they are attractive people and Tipi is wonderful in Edith Head's Jackie Kennedy  green skirt suit.  Tipi also sports the Vertigo style, platinum hair swirl which distracted somewhat because it appeared so stiff, as if a plastic wig.  The conversations are stilted though once Tipi has met up with Rod again at his Bodega Bay house, it seems to flow better. Finally, the birds take over and the last half of the film is pure suspense and pecking.

0684857219|2.0|This book does contain some great information and material. Unfortunately, not enough of it is based on research and science. If you want to know the truth about natural bodybuilding, its best to consult ACSM ( American College of Sports Medicine) or NSCA (National Strength & Conditioning Association). The routines and training frequency in this book are only suitable for the genetic elite and users of steroids and other harmful but effective performance enhancing substances. I began lifting using this book as a bodybuilding bible. I started at 175 pounds! I did make significant gains.....Initially. But I later learned I could have lifted fruit baskets and gained muscle mass with my low body weight. I am now 230 pounds 12% body fat (no exaggeration) and I could put on more muscle and lose fat if life permitted. But this progress is directly the result of books like \\"Power Eating\\" and \\"Brawn\\" and \\"Strength Training\\". The truth is, for continued progress in bodybuilding, this book is not a good book. Remember that Arnie did finally admit to taking just about any steroid or substance he could find, just before he became the governator! I have nothing against him, I sincerely respect him. But there is much more reliable material available.

B000N6TX22|2.0|I'm giving this two stars because if you are even considering this movie, then you just might like it a bit.  Good cast, good production value.  Potentially interesting story but also flaky...and it's pretty much a one trick pony...no more kids, bleak future, blah...    The ending is by far the worst part, but the 20 mins that precedes it is equally as bad (downright ridiculous imho).  My wife couldn't watch the whole thing, and I didn't even pressure her to stay.      I know there isn't much substance to this review...but trust me, this one is a stinker.

B000O75F7C|1.0|Have to say am most disappointed with my first few listens of this CD. After reading a few reviewers who raved about this band I went out and bought this cd. I find it really hard to listen to. For me there is nothing that reaches out and grabs you. Sure I am sure they are great muso's but they need to work on there songwriting to make it more listenable in my opinion. Its all a bit wishy washy and drab, could do with the occasional heavy riff or a change of pace to keep you interested. Obviously not for me, much better prog metal out there IMO.
B000R7I3LY|4.0|What a lovely, lovely album. As I learned by reading the reviews of A Fine Frenzy, I think it's unfair to compare every female singer-songwriter to the masters -- Bareilles is no Tori Amos, it's true, but I don't think it's fair to make her out to be. For unlike A Fine Frenzy, she's not *trying* to be excruciatingly profound with every lyric. And I get no relation to Fiona Apple whatsoever, and frankly, it's unfair to hold that against her: She's not Fiona Apple. But so what? She's doing exactly what she's meant to: singing lovely, fluffy, gorgeous jazzy pop with a smoky, rich tone to her voice, which is truly impressive in range.     It's poppy, it's fun, it's catchy and it's ultimately beautifully done. I was unexpectedly thrilled.

B000W07EKW|3.0|This set is a silver box containing the individual releases of all 3 Bourne movies. The first thing I noticed was a new 2007 DVD of The Bourne Identity with the spine number 61103847. The package looks like the previous \\"Explosive Extended Edition,\\" except this one's just called \\"Explosive Edition,\\" and lists Feature Commentary by Doug Liman as an extra feature. I was looking forward to hearing the commentary, and when I plugged in the DVD, it wasn't there! Even though the disc itself says 2007 on it, it's exactly the same as the 2004 version. If you're not into commentaries, then this is a great set.

I think there was a lot of potential in it though, and there were definately some hilarious moments in it. I'm  to read volume 2 and the black dossier to see what I think of the full series before I totally condemn it though.

B000F6YW0S|5.0|Williams' was the first complete recording of the suites I'd ever heard and at that time I was just overwhelmed by the flawless technique. The recording captures a special time for me during my initial \\"guitar freak phase\\" and I still enjoy hearing it. But musically, I've heard so many expressive players on different instruments since (not the least of which Casals and Gould) that, as far as Bach on the guitar goes, I now prefer Sharon Isbin's recording of the suites on Virgin, both for her tone and phrasing. And if I'm in a lute-mood, Bream is still my guy. But Williams set the bar with this recording as far as I'm concerned and, for guitarists of all bents, it's a must have.
B000VT6FAO|5.0|Thing is, Dave Gahan is getting better and better! For the 2nd album, this is fantastic!! Comparing to the todays music this is totally awesome, refreshing and unique!!    The music and lyrics of Hourglass are WAY better than Paper Monsters. Some songs have a SOFAD-like sounds, others are like DM produced it - and that's a good thing. Some are growers and need a bit of time to get used to them. Overall I'm very pleased with his effort.    For me, the best are saw something, kingdom, down, a little lie, deeper and deeper, insoluble.    I think this benefits the DM as well. I guess Dave is no longer in \\"who cares\\" mood. I'm sure he will make some great songs for next DM album!  Hourglass is the best album I have heard in quite a long time!!
B00009ATIX|5.0|This is a serious movie, and if you have already decided you don't like it you might consider asking yourself whether there is a deeper reason than the usual considerations.  Facing our mortality, it can be uncomfortable to contemplate immortality. Having found a faith or having confirmed our own lack of faith, perhaps it is uncomfortable to contemplate the alternative to which the Solaris story takes us. And so in that regard this is one of those movies that is a worthwhile experience even if it doesn't give you the most immediate reward, and that's the definition of a great movie.    I loved it. Steven Soderburgh captures the essential mood and mystery of the Solaris story through the changing venues (rainy Seattle, the stark interiors of the space station) all of which heighten the impact of the sentient planet whose mood itself changes in some relationship to the intense interactions of the characters. The sentient planet looks exactly as I, many years in advance, knew it should look and the relationships to that planet of the beings who its manifestations are exquisitely drawn. This is what it might be like to see the face of god.     This is a great movie because it drew me forward to a better place, intellectually and emotionally, and this is not directly dependent on my own religious beliefs or lack of them. The emotional impact is brought to a perfect peak by a poetically beautiful musical score.  See this movie if you are interested in the philosophical implications of your possible origin as manifestation of a more complex and incomprehensible process or in thinking about the nature of life and mortality.
B000W4HJ44|2.0|Having seen the original Hairspray on Broadway I was anxious to see the movie version. The musical was nothing but fun and expected the same in the movie. Sadly I felt it was a bit of a let down.I wish now I had rented the dvd rather than buying it.  Some great songs were left out of the movie and the ending was changed to name a couple of reasons I was disappointed. The biggest let down was Travolta's role. I felt his character was totally distracting and all i could think of was there is John Travolata dressed in a fat suit. Why they didn't use Harvey Fierstein I will never understand.Nicky Blonsky was great, as well as Queen Latifah. Just my opinion, but I say rent it  first.
0345440900|5.0|I just simply love this book.  It gave me a very good idea what my baby needs from me.  When I need to calm my baby, I mainly use techniques from \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\".  But when I try to figure out what parenting style is the best for my baby, I always use ideas from this \\"Baby Whisperer\\" book.<br /><br />I read some negative comments from other reviewers.  One thing I want to point out is, Tracy is NOT trying to list/compare all possible parenting methodS in the book.  She is trying to tell us what she believes and how SHE handles babies from her experience, the ways that work for her.  If you think other approaches work better for your kid, go ahead.  After all, every baby is unique.<br /><br />But I'm telling you, I have a 20 days old baby in my arm now, and I think I understand my baby very well thanks to this Baby Whisperer book.
159102594X|3.0|First let me say that is not a \\"bad\\" book, especially given the fact that it's the author's debut work.  I just think it's a misplaced book.  If not for all the gore, violence and strong language, I think this book would have made a great YA book.  I say this because in so much as writing style, character development and plot it was lacking something...call it nuance, subtlety...something that a good piece of literature for adults will have.  It could just be that my standards were too high or that I'm a huge snob...I don't know.  Overall I did enjoy the book and I imagine I'll end up checking out the next one.  Given that this is a debut work (according to what I've heard), it shows promise.
B000WQ9UA8|3.0|For a Britney Fan since her first album, I have to say I am very disappointed. On a happy noted, 4 singles did have me singing and dancing along. \\"Gimme More\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" are reasonabley catchy tune that you can dance to but definatley can't hold a candle to her smash hit \\"Toxic\\" which is what I was looking for on her comeback album. Yet I can say that \\"Piece of Me\\" and \\"Radar\\" are absolute hits and have that certain hook that \\"Toxic\\" has and those were really the only songs I felt like were vintage Britney. As for the remaining 9 singles, I found to be really pathetic attempts at being catchy but if you are a fan of Brooke Hogans kind of pop, you will love it! But I encourage everyone to support Britney and buy her album.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|For once one of the Village Vanguard's hipper than thou raves lives up to the hype.  Regardless of how it was created, this stuff reminds me of that movie where ghostly fragments of sound are captured electronically.  Chilling and fascinating, this really gets under your skin, setting off subliminal interference patterns.  Perhaps too perfect a soundtrack for the Overlook or room 1408.  Better yet, play it in you car while solo driving after midnight.  I'd disregard the various comparisons to anything more conventional and familiar (Portishead, etc.), this is as original as it is compelling.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Absolutley great album!!! When I first heard \\"Apologize\\" it gave me chills and I just awaited their debut album and hoped I wouldnt be let down, and I definatley wasn't!!! The album is a beautiful love story that has elements that many love songs today lack. My personal favorites were of course \\"Apologize\\" the orginal one, \\"Say (All I Need,\\" \\"Mercy,\\" \\"Tyrant,\\" \\"All We Are,\\" and \\"Someone to Save You.\\" With its soft rock melodies and Ryan's powerful voice you won't be disappointed.
1594489505|5.0|This is the best book I read during 2007 (and I read 4-5 books a week!)    I am old.  I am set in my ways.  I think I know how the world really is.  Sometimes I am wrong...    After spending the last 6 years railing against the US government (BUSH) that took us into the US - Afganistan war I finally see that it was necessary.  Not because we have a right to seek revenge against terrorist regarding Sept 11; not because they are non-belivers; not because they are less human -- but because our humanity requires us to defend humanity.  In this case the unspeakable treatment of women!    Now, what are we going to do about Darfur?  No oil to tempt our greed. No revenge to seek.  Will our humanity push us to step up and defend what is right for every human being?
0807126063|1.0|4.5 stars with 915 reviews. I expected to really enjoy this book. I am now on page 74 of 415 pages (i.e., 17% of the book). I am still waiting for it to get funny. The book is boring. The characters are unlikable. I doubt I will finish it. I don't understand what it is that everyone finds so funny about this book.    At best this book will give your vocabulary a workout. I would give this book zero stars if that was an option.
B00006DEF9|5.0|It's easy to see why this is consistently listed among the greatest films of all time.  As a devoted fan of musicals, I would have to rate it as my all time favorite.  The spectacular musical numbers, the incomparable finesse of Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, an interesting storyline that chronicles a great moment in motion picture history, and the added attraction of a bubbly young Debbie Reynolds combine to make this an unforgettable movie.<br /><br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the super couple of the silent movies.  When \\"talkies\\" catch on, Lina is ill-suited to the change.  Her screechy voice and Brooklynese delivery are like nails on chalkboard and something has to be done.  Don's friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor) and girlfriend Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) come up with a plan to save the movie.  Everyone's in on the subterfuge except Lina and the results are hilarious.  But it is the spectacular song and dance productions that will burn in your memory as you watch this.  The legendary performance in the rain by Gene Kelly will live on forever, but it is Donald O'Connor's madcap \\"Make `Em Laugh\\" that has always been my favorite scene in this or any movie.  In addition, Broadway Melody, Fit As A Fiddle, Beautiful Girl, Moses Supposes, You Are My Lucky Star, and many others make this one of the most entertaining experiences a viewer can have.<br /><br />The second disc in the box is filled with special features a movie fan will savor.  There is a documentary on Arthur Freed and the great movies he produced (Wizard of Oz, Meet Me in St. Louis, Show Boat, An American in Paris) in addition to this one.  Another feature is hosted by Debbie Reynolds and gives inside info on the filming and her anxiety over being in her first dancing movie with two pros like Kelly and O'Connor.  (She had three months of intensive dance lessons before she started filming).  There is information on how Donald O'Connor filmed his unforgettable solo in three days, the real-life connection between what the movie was spoofing and the Hollywood stars who were finished when the \\"talkies\\" took over, and lots more for movie buffs to enjoy.<br /><br />Altogether, a boxed set than any movie fan, especially a fan of musicals, should not miss.connection between what the movie was spoofing and the Hollywood stars who were finished when the \\"talkies\\" took over, and lots more for movie buffs to enjoy.

B000VLE3IS|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD combo from Led Zeppelin.  With classic hits like \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", and \\"Rock and Roll\\",  Led Zeppelin established themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of the late sixties and  seventies.  Robert Plant is a great front man.  Very few performers can make a shriek sound sexy, but Robert has that ability.  \\"Immigrant Song\\" contains a perfect example of this unique shriek.  I love John<br />Paul Jones' pulsating bass on this track too.  This song really pumps me up.  I loved watching the live performances of \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Kashmir\\" on the Dvd. It is clear from the DVD that they have a loyal legion of fans.  I also loved the tracks D'yer Maker and the pretty track \\"All My Love.\\"  One of my favorites \\"Fool in the  Rain\\" is excluded on here.  I was disappointed this track was not included, but I still  enjoyed this music combo very much.
0199206589|4.0|Since the advent of the Knowledge Society and Cyberspace some analysts have made rash claims about \\"the death of distance\\" and the irrelevance of territory.  Finally however a new metaphor has surfaced which both recognizes the new and respects the old:  \\"the continent with the fastest growing population is, in fact, a new one - the Internet.\\"  It is still only from geographically circumscribed territories that food and fibre are grown, and resources are mined or harvested.  And the networks that move people, information, commodities and money around the world transverse territories - that is what makes them networks!<br /><br />As Prof. Dodds recalls for us, the concept of geopolitics rose to prominence during the early 20th century, only to subsequently fall into disrepute and disuse after Nazi machinations were attributed to \\"geopolitical strategizing.\\"  This was guilt by association, but the popular press and the public itself accepted this distortion.  Only a half-century later is the true intellectual utility of geopolitical analysis finally being accepted again.  Dodds has won recognition for his efforts to reformulate and restore geopolitics to intellectual respectability.  In this short introduction he gives us the rationale for this way of thinking, and some of the insights produced with it.<br /><br />Now geopolitics has a more \\"critical\\" edge than when it was initially developed.  It is no longer the servant of power politics, but rather an instrument to analyze and challenge the complacent view of the world that \\"great power politics\\" suggests.  By looking at every message and every move of the politically and economically powerful, we can see how they are trying to define the issues in the global society in their own terms, so that they can mobilize support for their own efforts and resistance to the efforts of their opponents.  With the geopolitical perspective it is now apparent that the machinations of ALL of the great power players are Machiavellian, no matter which side they are on, or which policies they pursue.  What a relief to get beyond sanctimonious propaganda and see the motives and the methods for what they really are - multiple examples of the will to power.  Prof. Dodds is to be thanked for helping to promote that clarity of vision.ch side they are on, or which policies they pursue.

0066620996|4.0|I really enjoy Jim's work and generally hold his thoughts and theories in high regard. This book will provide any reader with valuable advice that can be used to drive their business forward. That being said, I offer the following caution...leadership is contextual. In my book [[ASIN:1432717731 Leadership Matters...The CEO Survival Manual: WHAT IT TAKES TO REACH THE C-SUITE AND STAY THERE]] I spend a decent amount of time discussing why one size fits all management recommendations can constitute extremely dangerous thinking. Categorizing certain \\"types\\" of leaders as effective and other \\"types\\" of leaders as ineffective is not only dangerous, but it is flat out wrong. Over the course of my career I have witnessed virtually every \\"type\\" of leader both succeed and fail. It is not the style of your leadership that matters, but rather the key issue is can you contextually, environmentally or situationally adapt your leadership skills to needs and demands of the time.
B000Y179KO|3.0|I saw the good reviews and the bad reviews, but when I was in a Walmart, I thought how bad could the eagles be at that price. Well, not that bad at all. Yes, after all these years, I would expect more, but Long Road Out Of Eden is still very listenable. Certainly not great. Desperado is a great album, One Of These Nights is a great album, Hotel California is almost great, in part because they are cohesive works. Here we have a jumble of songs, some are ok, some good, some very good. So sure, there was something missing here when I recall those past works, but with solid musicianship, singing, and those harmonies, it was worth getting.
0553588486|4.0|This is the book that started it all. It's a bit slow to begin with, but that's only because he's introducing all of the characters back-to-back. Hold tight, by the end of the book you won't be able to stop reading and you'll likely DIVE into the next book (A Clash of Kings)... A great book and solid 4 stars.
0743233832|5.0|Obviously, one may think the tag line is a bit of a dramatization, but it is not.    This collection of verses speaks to the timeless wisdom Aurelius distilled while at war. Truly a philosopher well beyond his time, his successful attempt to expound stoic ideals and how they can be APPLIED is always inspiring.    My only word of caution is that where you are in life right now may not be the right time for you to read this book. I have bought over 15 copies and given them out to close friends who I think would benefit from the words.    If you enjoy the book, I suggest reading reading the Enchiridion of Epictetus. I read that first, and was stunned by the current translation and text in comparison, even though the core assertion of truth is the same.    Best of luck, and enjoy!
0596527055|5.0|Berkun's second text is a quick but very thorough treatment of the whole notion of innovation and how we approach it, both in our lives and our work. He talks about the basics, where innovation comes from, how it happens (and,  perhaps more importantly, how it doesn't happen) but also delves into what happens after innovation, namely how ideas and innovations evolve and take on a life of their own once they are unleashed. If you were ever curious about the way innovation truly works, why good ideas don't always surface and why second best is sometimes the adopted standard, or if you're just interested in gaining a deeper appreciation for innovation as a concept, you should definitely check this one out. It's a quick, witty and accurate read and will most likely change your perceptions about innovation going forward. I highly recommend it.
B000W8OM5Y|4.0|Braveheart is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's a shame that Paramount doesn't make an effort to deliver a product worthy of the film. This new Collector's Edition is nothing less than mediocre. I have to admit that the content on Disc 2 is very good, the documentaries are amazing and it's the perfect complement for the movie. The movie's video quality has been definitely improved from the previous release, but as far as I can tell, the audio tracks are identical. It has the same commentary and audio quality than its predecessor.     The box on the other hand is so mediocre, I could cry. Paramount paid absolutely no attention to detail. There's no booklet, not even a lousy pamphlet in the inside and the discs look truly generic. It is definitely not worth being called a collector's edition. So, if  you love Braveheart, this edition will certainly please you in terms o its content, which make the movie more enjoyable, but don't expect too much from the packaging....it sucks.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Any film awaited with the kind of hyped eagerness as THE PHANTOM MENACE, George Lucas' first STAR WARS installment in sixteen years, would have had a hard time convincing audiences and critics. However, even given that, the film is a miscalculation on George Lucas' part. Clearly, Lucas wanted to start his saga on a lighter note as a contrast with the dark deeds he had waiting in the wings for the next two \\"prequels.\\" The problem is that he went too far. MENACE plays like an expensive Saturday morning kids' TV program. I can't help notice that many users have the same comment: \\"my five-year-old loved it.\\" As a childrens' film, it may be successful--though I can't imagine kids following all the political goings-on or not being disturbed by the image of the slave-child Anakin being torn from his enslaved mother--a motive that is never resolved satisfactorily. For adults, MENACE doesn't hold together. The comedy is too prevalent and juvenile--including bits of \\"poo-poo humor\\" and the most hackneyed of slapstick gags--for any of the serious elements to work. It is typical to regard the CGI creation Jar Jar Binks as emblematic of the problems. But really, Jar Jar, however irritating he is, sets the tone of the film--a kids' movie--more than anything else. It is the tone itself that is the problem: it is unsuitable for the beginning of a monumental saga whose last three chapters (the first filmed: STAR WARS, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI) are iconic and have long been part of our common cultural language.    The core of the prequel trilogy is the rise and fall of Anakin/Darth Vader, but the Anakin we see in MENACE, as weakly played by Jake Lloyd, is far too young, even if some lines convey a certain awareness. Moreover, the age difference between him and Padme (Natalie Portman) makes an attraction troubling if he's eight when she's about sixteen in MENACE. Of course, in the next film, they reduce the difference: she only seems about twenty to Anakin's nineteen, so the issue disappears.     Lucas also introduces an idea which is very unfortunate indeed, in that it demystifies the Force as something which, as Alec Guiness's Obi-Wan describes it in STAR WARS (1977), \\"surrounds us and penetrates us, binding the universe together.\\" In MENACE, it is reduced to the overabundance of \\"midi-chlorians\\" in the blood, making Jedi status a superior race, reminiscent of the horrible, crackpot, racist (and Nazi) eugenics theories of the early 20th century.    In short, THE PHANTOM MENACE could have been far superior with certain elements corrected, re-balanced, or eliminated. But Lucas didn't see it. As it stands, it would have been better as a half-hour introductory short to ATTACK OF THE CLONES.
0553582038|4.0|First and foremost, A Storm of Swords was SO good that \\"Feast\\" had a LOT to live up to. And it's still a solid book. I have a feeling that most people think less of this book because they're expecting a non-stop, action-packed pace (i.e. A Storm of Swords). It is what it is, book four. It's still well-written and an enjoyable read.
6305127697|5.0|\\"I don't have to believe you. I don't care if you are innocent. I'm your mother, your father, your priest.\\"  This is what defense attorney Martin Vale (Richard Gere) tells his client, Aaron Stampler (Ed Norton), as they are preparing to defend him against charges of killing the Archbishop of Chicago.     Of course, later, Marty says: \\"I believe in the notion that people are innocent until proven guilty. I believe in that notion because I choose to believe in the basic goodness of people. I choose to believe that not all crimes are committed by bad people. And I try to understand that some very, very good people do some very bad things.\\"     So--which one is true?  Nobody is quite what they seem in this legal procedural that will keep you in your seat and your finger away from the 'Pause' button for its entire 2 plus hours' duration.     First, you see the kindly Archbishop attended by a heavenly choir at a charity function.  The city loves him.  But, is his public face the same one he wears when he's all by himself with the altar boys?     Did bumbling, stuttering Aaron kill the Archbishop.  Nobody really wants to believe it.     Does Janet (Laura Linney) truly tow the company line as the assistant prosecutor?   Well, and is she truly no longer interested in Marty?     The plot's got more twists than a pretzel factory. I no sooner thought I knew what was going on or what someone was going to to when they changed it on me.      \\"Primal Fear\\" is one of the best written and acted courtroom dramas I've seen.  My only question to myself is why the heck did I wait this long?
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I was 18 years old in 1982 when I saw the original release of Blade Runner.  I was mesmerized with Blade Runner and I have been ever since.  Can you imagine my longsuffering all these 25 years?  Like so many, I have waited, first for the long awaited soundtrack, and now this.  I didn't feel the need for the 5 disc set and I have no regrets having purchased the 4 disc box set.  As of this writing, I have only viewed the 4th disc called the Enhancement Archive. (kinda like eating the side dishes/veggies before I savor the big steak) AMAZING!  Finally, I am getting my satisfactory fill and I'm just loving it.  For any of you considering just the two disc set, you must spend the extra to get this 4th disc alone.  I must say the segment on the director of photography, Jordan Croneweth, is so touching and insightful.    Since purchasing the movie yesterday from the local Borders bookstore, I have been walking the streets of Seattle in the December gloom and pouring rain--living like so many in the movie--under my umbrella.  I have been walking among the large assortment of homeless (Seattle is a utopia for the homeless) and the ubiquitous Asian population and I feel such a kinship with the movie.    I'd like to share a little tidbit from the 4th disc.  I don't recall which segment, but it shows a take of Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty) doing his poignant last scene and then you see the movie clapper board to end the take.  Someone comes up to Hauer and puts their hand on his shoulder as to congratulate him on a good job, he smiles and then seems to lose it a little bit emotionally.  It's subtle, but demonstrates the pathos he, the human being, must have felt doing that scene. What more can I say? It is just a great feeling to have all these treats to relish again and again.      One last thing... I'm in the camp that likes to examine all the clues that suggest Deckard may be a replicant, but in the end I believe he's really not a replicant.  He's a human who seemed to have losthis humanity over time with his career, divorce, etc. but then regained it from his life, death and love experiences with this group of replicants.      ENJOY!!!!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This cd is so comprehensive that you can re-live each scene in the movie in your head while you listen. The vocals are clear and flawless.

B000QUCNOK|3.0|Jean Baptiste Grenouille's (Ben Whishaw) birth foreshadowed his future.  His fishmonger mother squirted him out like the four stillborn babes before him.  When she believed him dead, she left him to be tossed with the day's guts.  His cry saved him--and damned his mother to the gallows.     From there, the baby went to an orphanage, raised just old enough to be sold as a servant to a tannery.  A trip to town taught him there was more to smell than just dead animal hides.      His sense of smell brings him to the attention of once famous perfumier, Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) who teaches him everything he knows--until his protege tries to cook down the cat to gain its essence.     From there, he continues in search of the perfect scent and discovers the best way to obtain a truly divine perfume--which happens to be rendered from the rendered fat of women he killed.     \\"Perfume\\" details the killer's process of 'discovering' his perfect perfume.  As one might expect, the dehumanization of of Grenouille's own life gave him no concept of any other--animal or human. His progress from animal killer to human serial killer is grisly, shocking, and far too realistic.      Cinematography was excellent. Whishaw, Hoffman, and Alan Rickman as Richis, a local nobel desperately seeking the man who killed his daughter, were all convincing. Certain elements of the story were unfortunately somewhat surreal.      \\"Perfume\\" is a one-time view for me.  The story pushed far too many buttons for me--and frankly was slow enough in more than one place to make me want to stop before the end.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Amazing! I was thinking, can Serj do it alone? I mean, he's a great singer and song writed, but with out SOAD i was afraid he'd fall short of the mark. NOPE. He came, he sang, he conquered. One of those rare CDs to be listened to all the way through again and again until your ears bleed. You either love the CD or YOU LOVE THE CD! I can't wait for the tour.

1594489505|2.0|Husseini is not the most impressive writer in the sense that his style, his prose can at times be choppy. This sticks out to an extent in A Thousand Splendid Suns. Despite that the Kite Runner was \\"a bit Hollywood\\" in places, the story amd the setting really sucked you in. That doesn't happen so much in A Thousand Splendid Suns. It's just not nearly the book that The Kite Runner was.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Amazing Journey is candid, frank and sometimes unflattering to the members of the Who.  Townshend and Daltrey are artists, and as such, didn't get in the way of the producers by forcing glossed over accounts of their 45 year career.  Since the death of John Entwistle in 2002, Townshend and Daltrey have stepped back from the egos that fueled years of fueding, and gracefully acknowledged their collective pasts.  As a Who fan, you must buy this.  There are 4 mini docs (6 total) that explore the musical contributions of each band member from an academic stand point.  The feature on Keith Moon's drumming is especially enlightening since most people think he was an undisciplined player, with no idea what he was playing.  After watching, you will understand he was probably a savant, besides being self-destructive.  The doc on Daltrey is equally enlightening.    The sound quality is amazing, as all tracks have been remastered and actually have audable bass!
0743298039|2.0|I read the great reviews and purchased the audio copy of this book. It was a great premise and could have been a great book but it was so slow and lumbering I had to make myself finish it because I had paid for it! The story itself was of interest but it could have been told in far less time.
B00000DCHI|5.0|This two CD set gives us an incredible assortment of Billy Joel's greatest hits. The sound quality is excellent and the songs collected here couldn't be better. A few hits including \\"Honesty\\" are missing, but overall this remains a set of CDs in which every song is a classic Billy Joel number.<br /><br />In fact, there are so many huge hits on the two CDs that I scarcely know where to start! There are many terrific ballads. \\"Piano Man\\" has a great arrangement for piano and harmonica; and Billy never sounded better. \\"Captain Jack\\" rocks really well and Billy sings this without a flaw. \\"New York State Of Mind\\" always moves me with its stunning beauty; what a homage to New York, capital of the world! Billy delivers \\"New York State Of Mind\\" without a superfluous note and his piano playing lacks nothing, either--it's all THAT good.<br /><br />\\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\" isn't on The Essential Billy Joel two CD set; and this is perhaps one of Billy Joel's finest numbers ever. The piano and horn work wonders for this ballad. \\"Just The Way You Are\\" is a touching love ballad with Billy, the piano, the horn and some excellent subtle backup vocals.\\" \\"Movin' out (Anthony's Song)\\" is an excellent, gritty song about life for so many of us which only Billy could do as well as he does it here. \\"Only The Good Die Young\\" is equally stellar.<br /><br />I especially like \\"You May Be Right\\" and \\"It's Still Rock And Roll To Me;\\" these classic Billy Joel hits sound every bit as good today as they did all those years ago. \\"Tell Her About It\\" is an example of Billy performing `80s pop music; and listen for \\"Uptown Girl\\" to continue this flavor. One last song that can't be left out is \\"You're Only Human (Second Wind);\\" this great song about learning from \\"your accidents\\" tells it like it is about life happening while you're planning something else and how you can learn from your mistakes.<br /><br />The liner notes came in a cool booklet with some great artwork.<br /><br />Overall, although not every last Billy Joel hit is here (for example, \\"Honesty\\" is missing), this would be still a solid two CD set of Billy's great hits. This is best for the casual fan who wants to avoid the expense of buying every individual album; but diehard Billy Joel fans may well want this in their collections as well.<br /><br />Thank you, Billy!is here (for example, \\"Honesty\\" is missing), this would be still a solid two CD set of Billy's great hits.

B000002GVO|5.0|I've just \\"rediscovered\\" this fine album.  It remains among the most timeless in all of rock music.  The fact that it is still regular price (and not reduced to the el cheapo section) attests to the quality of music herein.  I first purchased this on vinyl back when it first came out (1976).  The fact that it's sold more than 16 million copies is another statement of the quality of music produced on this disk.
1594489505|4.0|This story gives a glimpse into a world most Americans have no understanding of--a world of male domination that makes no allowance for the value of the woman.  It is a painful book to read but balanced with deep feeling and emotion.  I felt like I was right there in Afghanistan feeling and seeing the sights and happenings of life.  I highly recommend it.

B00004RF83|5.0|Quite by accident, several years ago, I stumbled across the Seven Days in May on the telly.  I stopped for a moment and in an instant was completely pulled into this film.  Brilliantly written, acted, and directed, it is nothing short of a modern masterpiece.<br />At the time it was just a very good film, unlikely but perhaps plausable... Now, as the checks and balances of the American constitution are rapidly being eroded, it becomes more believable, and considerably more frightening.  If you've seen the remake you must see this original, because as originals most often are, this is far superior.<br />Recommended for those with an interest in politics, history-buffs, and every fan of well crafted film!

B000BJS4OY|5.0|If you need convincing about BTR as a seminal rock and roll record I'll leave it to someone else. It's a soundtrack to many lives and the songs hold up without explanation. It's a hybrid album, the transition from epic songs to pared down songs, from beat poet to a new Woody Guthrie. But what I want to say is, buy this for the Hammersmith show, because it is there that you see a hungry artist and a hungry band--and a \\"band\\" they are. After Born in the USA, it was Bruce and the other guys (and still is). Turn off the lights, turn up the sound, grab a few beers, and watch this show. I have been to hundreds of concerts and even more club shows in my life, and I have never seen a band with so much talent, such great material, or chemistry. As Bruce says, he still challenges any band to match those elements from Hammersmith. And seeing Bruce before the stadiums is endearing and humbling...you remember that this guy worked for everything he got. And there is nothing as dangerous as great musicians put to the challenge...as was the case at Hammersmith. The making of BTR DVD is also great, for the same reason, for we see that genius is indeed hard work. Musicians in particular should watch this, to understand the effort undertaken. Buy this thing...and if you know Bruce mostly after the BTR era, BUY THIS THING. Because this ain't no Dancing in the Dark.

B000WCDI5K|3.0|I found \\"Sawdust\\" to be a bit dark for my taste on the first listen but I had the same reaction to Peter Gabriel's \\"Up\\" and after a few times grew to like most of the songs, so I am hoping the same will happen here. I would say that the version of \\"Sam's Town\\" on this album is really super (and I like the original very much). The cover of Dire Straits' \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" brings tears to my eyes - just extraordinary vocal work and interpretation. While I don't think \\"Sawdust\\" will move to the top of my favorites list like \\"Sam's Town\\" has, it is still a worthwhile effort from a band that I believe does brilliant work.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|The first track I heard from this angelic voice was `Bottle it Up' and I immediately drew the comparison to Jason Mraz.  A female version of Mraz was very appealing to me since Mraz is one of my favorite performers.  When I finally got around to purchasing Bareilles' album `Little Voice' I received a little Jason Mraz, a little Sarah McLachlan, a little Alicia Keys and a lot of Sara Bareilles.  From the opening `Love Song' to the powerful closing track `Gravity' Sara Bareilles delivers top notch musical ecstasy.<br /><br />The opening piano ballad `Love Song' is not what it may seem.  It's more of an anti-love song bellowing about the fact that just because you want her love does not mean you deserve it nor will you get it.  The stripped down musical melody help elevate Sara's beautiful vocals which have every opportunity to shine within this track and they take every opportunity in full stride.  She carries this same structure through tracks like `Between the Lines', another piano ballad that rest heavily upon her eclectic voice.  The two finest tracks on the album also fall in line with the two aforementioned songs.  `City' and the closing masterpiece `Gravity' are spellbinding in structure and delivery.  `City' feels almost fragile, especially as Sara loses herself in the chorus.  I don't know what I can even say about `Gravity' aside from \\"wow\\".  The song sends chills down my spine and leaves me feeling a way that only the most powerful music can.  There's no wonder why this is regarded as one of her finest musical moments.<br /><br />Not everything here is a ballad though.  Like I mentioned, tracks like `Bottle it Up' exude Jason Mraz, an almost pop feel to it.  `Bottle it Up' is one of the best songs on the album, very catchy and consuming.  You can't help but get lost in the song.  `Love on the Rocks' is a very bouncy track.  The beat almost reminds me of a television theme song.  Listen to it.  Doesn't it?  Maybe I'm crazy.  `Many the Miles' continues the upbeat (bouncy, I just like that word) tradition beautifully.  I love what she does with these tracks, makes them seem so salon-like.  `Morningside' imputes an element of seduction, adding an almost sultry layer to the surface of the track.  Sara's voice just smothers the listener.  I'm so in love with the chorus of this song.  `Fairytale' is such a fun song.  Truthfully it took me a few listens to appreciate it, but now I love it.<br /><br />On `One Sweet Love' Sara ditches the piano for an acoustic guitar and proves that no matter which instrument backs her talent she shines bright as the sun.  `Come Round Soon' is a definite highlight of the album and, you can tell, pulls influence from a certain well known Jamiroquai track.  If there is a track on the album that could sum up what to expect from Sara Bareilles I think it would be `Vegas'.  No, it's not the best track here but I think that the all around feel of the song defines the style this songstress possesses.  It's very smooth, soothing, captivating and easy to fall into.<br /><br />So, in the end `Little Voice' is far from a fair description of this masterful album.  Sara Bareilles proves that her voice is far from little.  It's powerful, elegant, beautiful and engrossing.  The definition of easy listening, `Little Voice' is a little treasure that no CD-Library is complete without., I just like that word) tradition beautifully.

140120306X|5.0|The greatest writer in comic history has created a book with such incredible production values that everything else on the shelves seems shabby in comparison.
B00005ASOC|5.0|***** 2000. Directed by Gus Van Sant. A cloistered writer becomes the mentor of a young man from the Bronx.

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|First, I don't see how people can complain that there is nothing new about a video that is being released for the first time! Where is the logic in that?    Now, to the actual review. The video for Vicarious is Tool's first entirely CG music video, running just a little longer than the length of the song of the same title on the 2006 album 10,000 Days [the extra length consists of ambient noise or silence, in terms of the audio track--the song has not been lengthened]. The video is very conceptual and well thought out by all counts, living up to Adam Jones' lofty legacy of directing and shaping Tool's surreal videos into deeply philosophical experiences. I won't take your time up here with any sort of analysis, but I will say that I recommend viewing the video repeatedly. For myself, the first time through I was aware of only a small fraction of what was going on in the video. Again, this is characteristic of most all Tool videos. One subtle thing that took me a long time to notice is the startling differences between the specters, and what their behavior is symbolic of. There are many such hidden gems in the video.    The extras on this DVD put the DVD singles for Parabola and Schism to shame. Foremost is \\"The Vicarious Documentary\\", directed by Camella Grace, documenting the creation of the video and revealing a lot of its hidden meanings. Some of the interviewees includes Alex Grey, Chet Zar, Kevin Willis, and many others, including much of the CG animation team from Hydraulx, who worked on the video. Alex Grey's comments are particularly revealing and it is great to see him make as long of an appearance as he does here. Pay attention to his comment about our culture.    Also included are two tracks of audio commentary set to the video, recorded by David Cross of Mr. Show fame (anyone remember where Puscifer got its start?). While they are worth not much more than a few good laughs, I have to say they are a step up in the comedy department from the commentaries on the previous two DVDs. That Cross goes to the liberty of naming the various characters in the video is pretty hilarious in itself. Take it all, of course, with a grain of salt.     Storyboards by Adam Jones and Alex Grey are included, as well as a brief segment on Alex and Allyson Grey's Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in New York City. Both are worth at least one watch; some of the shots of CoSM are particularly impressive, displaying some of Alex Grey's greatest art.    In all, I don't think anyone has a right to complain about this DVD. Tool never purported that live material was going to be included, so there was no reason to expect it. In addition, it is not right to think of this as paying ten dollars for \\"just a music video\\". Adam Jones' work really  transcends the whole concept of a music video. It's more like a short film, set to a great song. If it were treated like \\"just a music video\\", it would be hard for Mr. Jones to get the kind of recognition he deserves, seeing edited cuts of the film on MTV every few hours. This kind of art doesn't deserve to be treated that way, and if you understand that and appreciate the work of Adam Jones and Tool, you have no reason not to pick this up.
0439882826|2.0|This purchase was not at all what I had expected!  A great deal of thought was placed on the pop-ups, which were very intricate.  I'm not sure what the target age for this book would be.  The young child may have difficulty caring for the book in the way that it should be and I don't think it catches the attention of someone older.  Of course, this is only my opinion.
B000QY4ZXI|5.0|I'm merely writing this review to add a different viewpoint.  While this book has gotten a lot a scathing reviews for its apparent atheistical viewpoint, I have found it to be not only enthralling but intelligent as well.  It seems as though nowadays if one portrays a religion as being in any way bad, it is trying to undermine it.  This is simply not true in this series.  Sure the ruling power is based on a more church-based idea and it reminds me in some ways back to when the church was the ultimate ruling party-but that's not the point.  The book portrayed marvelously not hatred of religion, but the need to question any governing body that demands complete and utter compliance of its people and discouraging anyone who might try to find answers for themselves.  The fact that the governing body was made religous in nature, in my view, was merely to show that this can be done morally as well as legally.  It is easier to control people by telling them something is morally wrong (while playing on superstitions)than just to tell them not to do something \\"because I said so\\". This is a wonderful story-empowering, thoughtful, creative, and intelligent.  I made everyone I know read it and they have all loved it as well. Many discussions have emerged from reading this book as it really does make one think-and that's hard to find these days.  Don't be turned off by comments about the religious aspect or you (and maybe your children) will be missing a story about growing up with dedication, determination, belief in oneself, love, loss, sacrifice, and doing what's right even if it's not what you want to do-which is made most abundantly clear at the very end of the series. Also, the fact that there is both a prominent male and female character (although Lyra is the shining star) makes this empowering for both boys and girls.    PS  I would recommend using your own discretion in choosing the age for your child to read this.  Afterall, it is the Dark Materials and some aspects could be disturbing for the very young, but my cousin who is 8yrs read it and adored it.
B0000024UX|5.0|This album is the last regular album Simon and Garfunkel put together before their break-up. I received this album on cassette and then on CD. This album is better in its original format instead of the new editions with new covers and artwork (2001 edition). My uncle has this on vinyl. Bridge Over Troubled Water is a classic.
B000M341QE|4.0|It's brutal, it's honest, it's inventive, it's intriguing. The cast is incredible from Leonardo DiCaprio to Jack Nicholson to Matt Damon to Mark Wahlberg. I'm still convinced Leo did a better job in Blood Diamond, but here his acting is equally superb. The directing is great - Martin Scorsese at his bloodiest and best.
0399213015|5.0|This is such a cute little version of the original.  Great for traveling with kids! I loved this book when I was younger, and now I can enjoy it again with my daughter - in a smaller, (easier for her to focus on) version.
B000YAA6AU|2.0|Unfortunately, this movie was poorly cast. The storyline is there, the idea is exciting and genuinely romantic. The cast, principals in particular is really off. there is no chemistry between Gerrard Butler and Hilary Swank. It comes down to Hilary Swank's inability to be a romantic leading lady. It's hard to imagine her romantically with anyone and Gerard Butler doesn't come through for both of them. Harry Connick Jr., who used to be a gorgeous crooner, from Hope Floats to a reoccurring role on Will and Grace has now turned into an overweight guy who is getting second-hand roles. Gina Gershon, who is usually great in each of her performances, is plagued by bad face impressions. James Marsters is extremely underused. Lisa Kudrow, the comedic light of the film, shows promise but could be a lot funnier and is generally a lot funnier in all her other roles. The only interaction that makes sense is that between Kathy Bates' character and Hilary Swank's. Their mother-daughter relationship is shaky but gets the much-needed boost at the end. The admirable features of the movie are all due to what must be genuinely good source material, i.e. the novel it is based on. The idea that the heroine isn't dependant on the guy for her salvation, but, in fact, looses herself in him is gutsy. The fact that her involvement with the love of her life stunts her ability to find herself and that it's his death that releases her is so fascinating to see on the screen and so real, that's it's scary. I only wished they would focus more on this and develop it. If they had only embraced it! Still, as far as romantic comedies go, it's refreshing to see that every once in a while there comes a movie that doesn't end with a happily ever union.
B000WGNLLW|5.0|This album is not what I was expecting. It's all techno-rave-pop sounding stuff. Most songs sound a little slow to me, but there are a few that are more upbeat. \\"Nite-Runner\\" is my favorite. It's great when you're driving: just crank the bass up and woohoo! \\"Falling Down\\", \\"Tempted\\" and \\"Tricked Out\\" are cool also. \\"Skin Divers\\" is interesting.   I love Duran Duran, so I'm going to like just about anything they come out with. This album is really like nothing they've ever done before. If I had to compare it to another one of their albums, I'd say it's closer to Medazzaland - electronica-esque. Quite different, but enjoyable! :)
B000WZAE1I|4.0|A great fantasy movie, even if it doesn't have the grandeur scope of Lord of the Rings or the magical surroundings of Harry Potter movies. The story is snarky and intelligent. The acting is pretty good, wit Robert DeNiro's funniest performance to date. Although Claire Danes is the one playing the star, it is Michelle Pfeiffer who radiates and shines. In the movie her beauty is explained, but what's her real-life secret for looking so sexy at 50?
0061122416|2.0|I really tried to like this book. I had heard so much about how great it was supposed to be and I was excited when I found a good copy for a dollar in a used book store. Now I'm glad I only spent a dollar about it. Anymore would have been a waste of money.     I read the first third of the book (it being thankfully very short) and then I gave up. This book is far from what I expected, and far from what other people had said. First of all, he writes like his audience is a crowd of middle school students. I know what you're thinking. Many good books, like The Little Prince and Animal Farm, are written with simplistic language and also have wonderful philosophical meanings and messages, which would explain why they are now classics. I know. I've read these books and I absolutely love them. But this book doesn't have that graceful style the previous two books have. I can't properly describe the inelegance and annoyingly instructive language here. I can only say that a middle school student could definitely write just like the author does in this book.     Another problem is that the theme and message is too one dimensional and I feel like the author wants to pound the theme into my head with a sledgehammer. Please, he names his theme. Something like \\"Hidden Destiny,\\" or something? I don't remember, but you can find this title almost on every page. Because the boy must find his \\"Hidden Destiny.\\" (or whatever it's called.) It feels like the author is poking the reader with a stick and saying over and over again his theme. This is the first book I've ever read where the author insisted on naming and repeating his theme consistently to his audience. Many authors leave the reader to find his message and to interpret it individually. The constant repetition made me feel uneasy. Also, the author never develops the theme anymore than that everyone has a destiny and should thrive to search for their dreams. I'm not saying that this is a bad message at all, don't get me wrong onthat. The book does not go out any further than this, however, and many times I saw the book wearing thin with the constant repetition of this theme.    I also heard this novel is sexist, and I did see the hints of that in the beginning (all the girl does is wait for the shepherd boy to come back to her; why doesn't SHE have some awesome journey to Egypt too?), but I don't think I have read far enough to catch it all, least alone comment on it.     I just want to say that this book doesn't deserve the hype it has received. And I don't think it should be called a classic in the making. I believe it doesn't match up to certain classics others have compared this book to.
0143038419|2.0|When I began reading this work, it captivated my attention. All the lush workings of Italy, come to life in the ink of her pen. Her movement to India... began a long drawn out discription of how she spent her days... for hours and hours.. doing nothing but contemplation. By the end of the book, I was irritated that she sprang out of a marriage, that didn't seem that bad.. continually talked about another romantic relationship she bailed out on...  By the end I was more upset that someone got paid to run around to all these beautiful spots for a years time than I was interested in what she had to say. So much more could have been expounded on. Most of the things she \\"experienced\\"  happened because she was without distraction. Something the other 99% of us never get a chance to do. Kids, Jobs.. Our lives are REAL. We may never spend a week in an Ashram... After reading this, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't want to.... Congratulations to her for being paid to take a trip around the world... must be nice.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Wow, I can't believe all of the positive comments for this season! After Amy, the creator of the show, left the scene after season 5, things definitely went downhill. The witty dialog was gone, and the characters were completely out of their element. If you watch interviews with Amy you'll see that she IS Lorelai Gilmore. The show wasn't the same after she left. With that said, I still purchased seasons 6 and 7 to complete my collection. I watch seasons 1-5 over and over, while the last 2 seasons collect dust on my shelf. So sad to see such an amazing show go out in such a horrible way.

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|Great movie but it wasn't originally recorded in HD so it can't be played back with HD quality.  I think the regular DVD looks the same.  Spider Man 3 was recorded in HD so it would be worth buying in Blu-ray format.  For 300, save yourself some money and buy the DVD instead.  I think the industry should state whether or not a movie is actually recorded in HD.
B000PY52EU|4.0|This film is not for everyone.  Don't show it to your mother.  But it is surprisingly entertaining.  Christina Ricci is a superb actress, is overwhelmingly sexy, and her beautiful body is on generous display.  The DVD presents the film with a beautiful picture.  Very clean, with excellent color and detail.  Couldn't get much better.  Decent bonus material, but won't really knock your socks off.  If you liked the film, this is a nice DVD with which to preserve it for the future.
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is perhaps the best special edition of any film I've ever seen on DVD.  I'm glad this treatment was given to a film that is a true, honest-to-goodness SF classic.    I won't bother go into the story--others have done so already.  I will say that everything in Ultimate Edition--and yes, it is available in standard def as well as HD and Blu-Ray--just blew me away.  From the 3+ hour documentary about the making of BLADE RUNNER to the various featurettes to the five--count 'em, five--versions of the movie, this set should be the last word for anyone who loves this film (or who loves movies in general).  Plus you gotta love that minature Spinner that was included!    As for the price...it was worth it.  Yes, it isn't cheap, but you know what?  The best things in life ain't free.  As for the complaints about the \\"Final Cut\\" messing stuff up...c'mon people, Ridley Scott himself supervised the thing!  If the director cannot go back and fix his film that he made then what's the point?    BLADE RUNNER is still as powerful for me today as it was when I saw it twenty-three years ago on VHS (ah, the years...).  This set was a must-get, and it is absolutely worth it.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I just ordered this item, and I ordered it because it contains the original version in the film.  Sometimes I think the studios (although wrong sometimes) protect the directors from themselves.  For example, cutting the building a mountain scene from Close Encounters and instead adding a soap opera version of the family fighting.  I like the naratations and the happy ending.  SPOILER COMING:  Lets face it, the end of the director's cut makes it look like Dekered is going to kill Rachel.  The only part I can live without is the head squishing scene.
B001041JLE|5.0|I love this! When the Thriller album came out I was too young. Although I bought the other re-releases I am glad that this time its an official celebration of this amazing album! I am also glad to hear that there are remixes by various artists. I can't wait to hear this!!!! P.S. MJ AFTER THIS WE NEED SOME NEW STUFF MAN!!!!!
B000WTLDPU|5.0|I never saw this movie before.  The only reason I knew about it was through a preview for it online.  Looked good but when it came out no one saw it so I thought it was npph.  But I read some reviews for it and wanting to expand my HD DVD collection went out and bought it the day it came out.  Hoping I didn't waste $30.00 I popped it in as soon as I got home.  Not disappointed at all.  In fact it was even better then what I thought it was going to be.      Its like Lord of the Rings meets comedy and almost as long.  The humor is great and isn't cheesy.  The SFX are awesome.  And the ladies...all beautiful.  Michelle Pfeiffer may be near 50 but she is hot hot hot!  Robert DeNiro gives a surprising performance (watch the movie to see what I'm talking about) and the cast of brothers is great.  If you have HD DVDs add this to your collection.  You won't be disappointed.
B000IONJH4|2.0|I enjoyed the novel Dune, and I enjoy David Lynch as a director, but this movie is pretty terrible.  It was almost a literal adaptation of plot points in the novel, right down to internal monologue being dubbed over as we hear the characters thinking.  Unfortunately it's not bad enough to be funny.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|Rarely does a movie based on a comic stay true to the original concepts of its graphic cousin. Surprisingly, little has been changed from the original Ghost Rider tome, which makes this film an even larger disappointment.     Nick Cage, as usual, adds a bit of his own jokiness to the role including a dash of that overdone Elvis impression of his. There are a few rare moments in the portrayal of Johnny Blaze that makes the audience feel for his predicament. Unfortunately for Cage, those moments are acted out by the younger Blaze played by Matt Long.     Eva Mendes is the breast-tacular Roxanne Simpson, Blaze's lost childhood love turned journalist. (This script left out the part about Roxanne being Johnny's stepsister and maybe that was for the best - eeew!) Mendes as a journalist is about as believable as Madonna playing the Holy Mother Mary - no offence to the Pop Queen, but it just isn't happening. When will Holly-would learn that the pretty face also has to have some acting talent to back it up?    The movie falls all over itself, first taking the material very seriously and then almost poking fun at the script. One cannot tell if this is a comedy or a serious drama. Do I laugh at the dim-witted jokes? It was confusing to say the least. Scenes are completely disjointed throughout the movie making the pace irregular and leaving one with the sense that the cutting room floor is littered with pieces of what could have been an awesome film.    There was a great deal of wasted scenes and buildup, particularly where the romance in the film was concerned. Most would agree that they bought a ticket to see Ghost Rider combing the streets for the souls of the damned not trying to make kissy face. After wading half way through the movie's starry-eyed mire, The Rider's transformation was somewhat disappointing with Cage screaming and walking around like Frankenstein. Don't expect any witty dialogue from Ghost Rider once he has changed either. Its all lame one liners and wornout clichés from our flaming cranium hero.    There was a somewhat interesting handling of The Rider on his bike of hell fire. It was fascinating how the bike tore up the roadway beneath it, but, would it have? Hell fire after all is a supernatural fire, only acting like real fire when The Rider chooses. One supposes that Ghost Rider had a penchant for causing collateral damage as he flew through the city streets blowing up cars and causing general mayhem. Naturally, there were a few great shots of cars flying through empty stores. But why? Why waste all that man-power and money on showing cars blowing up when it should have been spent on CGI and better costumes.    Which brings us to the bad guys. Why do the bad guys always have to where long leather trench coats? Was there some law passed in Holly-would about villain attire that we are not aware of? Please, for the love of  Edith Head, let the bad guys where something besides black leather and paisley velvet, especially when our hero is dressed in a black leather biker outfit!    Just who are the villains? That would be Blackheart and his merry minions, The Hidden, angels cast out of heaven hiding within the elements of earth(Grissel), water (Wallow) and air (Abigor). Blackheart has been reduced to showing up only in human form and his shape shifting abilities are never mentioned or explored. The Hidden could have been very interesting villains but sadly, they were killed off too quickly.      The other heavies are the city police, who happen to find Blaze's license plate at the scene of a crime. Apparently, finding circumstantial evidence at a crime scene can lead to about 10 police cars coming to your doorstep to ask you a few questions. In this town, if you do come \\"downtown\\" quietly and answer all their questions in a civilized manner, they then have the right to throw you in jail! Well, that is Texas justice for you.    The music for this film was a tad disappointing as the remix of \\"Ghostrider\\" by the Rollins Band should have been added in some fashion - although Henry, being very astute, may not have wanted any of his music associated with this steaming pile of ...well you know.    Get this DVD on sale and only if you just have to have it to complete your ultimate Marvel collection.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|They did it exactly right. Kept the essence, were true to the original series - just cleaned up the images, added some great new shots of the ship - but it still looks like the original series - nothing added, no little tweaks, no Han Shot Second garbage - just a perfect, clean, update of the series, and some really great extras.
B00005JPLW|5.0|The 300's brilliant imagery is inspired by Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name. This film was literally like watching a painting. The blood splatter was breathtaking. The limbs flying seemed to have a grace of their own. It was brutally beautiful with gorgeous gore. Enough cannot be said for this film while at the same time this reviewer is at a loss for words!    There are a few twists and tweaks of  historical truths ( ex. the fighting style and Phalanx), but overall the movie stays fairly close to the reality. Even the scholar Herodotus took great liberties in explaining the history of the ancient world, such as suggesting that Leonidas fought against 2 million, while archaeologists agree it was probably more like 200,000. This does not diminish the film which was clearly not produced as a historically accurate account but as a sword swinging, bare-chested celebration of abs and flying body parts.     For those of you not familiar with ancient Greek history, here is a quick synopsis of the legend of King Leonidas. Leonidas was the 17th in the Agiad line, a procession of rulers believed to have been direct descendants of Heracles.   Refusing to bow under the pressure of Persian oppression, Leonidas set out against their ruler, Xerxes, with only 300 Spartan troops. He and his valiant men were able to hold back the Persian invasion for two days in what is referred to as the Battle of Thermopylae.     There are a few lines in the movie which are taken directly from historic texts. For example, when Xerxes demands that the Spartans drop their weapons, Leonidas was heard to reply, \\"Come and get them!\\". On the third morning and what would be the final day of battle, the king told his men to eat hearty for they would be dining in Hades that night.     Ephialtes, a Thessalian man, apparently betrayed the King by showing the Persians an alternative route to attack the Spartans from behind. There were two Spartans who escaped death at Thermopylae on the third dayof battle. One in particular, Aristodemos, suffered an eye injury and was taken back to Sparta. He would later return and fight at the Battle of Plataea which would force the Persians to give up any further invasions into Greece.     The actors were outstanding considering they worked with a blue or green screen behind 100 percent of the time. King Leonidas is portrayed by Gerard Butler, an actor with a voice so powerful that everyone in the theater should be convinced to join him in battle. The gorgeous Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo with style and throws down two of the best lines in the movie. Backing up our heroes is an efficient cast of actors such as Dominic West, David Wenham and Rodrigo Santoro.     This is the classic story of the little guy versus the known world with a clear message that freedom must be earned - sometimes in bloody, decapitated fashion.
B001152TL6|5.0|It's not a popular position to take considering all the reasons people admire his other films, but LOST HIGHWAY has always been my personal favorite of David Lynch's since its release in 1997.      I never tire of watching it.  Even by its maker's standards, it's a powerful and unapologetically dark concoction which can inspire a really gut-level, intuitive, sensory response from a viewer.    The film manages to capture the rare and delicate mood I can only describe this way:    You wake from a terrifying, cryptic nightmare.  You can't decode it.  Your heart is racing.  With the morning's progress, the terror fades, but certain scenes remain indelibly in your mind.  You mull them over in the context of 'reason.'  Sometimes a feeling you have while 'awake' takes you back to these scenes...and they appear different somehow.  You think you begin to understand.  But then as quickly as your understanding comes, it vanishes again.    When the next night comes, you startle yourself with a realization: in its own way, that nightmare world is as seductive and beautiful as it was scary.  Something strange, almost alien in you wants to go back.  But you can't dream the same dream twice.    Except when it's a film.    And that's what LOST HIGHWAY is.    In a career full of startling images, music and sounds, it easily contains some of Lynch's most incredible ones.  The visuals are like a symphony of red, black, pale yellow, neon and smoke.  The textures of Los Angeles are captured with a dream- and life-like detail which are both familiar and exotic.  The sounds and music are enveloping and alluring one minute and pulse-quickening the next.    The performances are strong all around, with even the most minor characters played with notes only Lynch and his carefully chosen actors could hit.    Although Lynch has also explored his non-linear storytelling side in other, more popular efforts, I think he struck the perfect balance between the abstract elements which challenge and theaccessible pleasures of the film-noir genre in this particular story.  LOST HIGHWAY veers more toward the all-out assault of [[ASIN:B000QQFKYE INLAND EMPIRE]] or [[ASIN:B00003CWPL ERASERHEAD]], rather than the more glammed-up [[ASIN:B00005JKJA MULHOLLAND DRIVE]], but I think it also feels truer to itself, and so more resonant.    EDIT:  Now that the actual DVD product is out and I own a copy...I can say that the DVD is good for the following reasons: the picture and sound, as expected, are tops.  This is probably the best homevid version which exists, at least until the Blu-Ray version comes out (there are no plans for one though that I am aware of currently).  There are some web reviews that claim other transfers of it on non-Region 1 discs are superior, but based on the screen captures I have seen I think they are wrong.  This does look to me like the Lynch-approved version, with colors truer to the film as I remember it in theaters.    There are also chapter stops, a welcome surprise given Lynch's dislike of them and their exclusion on some of his other DVDs.    And the bad: no extras.  The expected 10-angle interview never appears here (why?) and not even the excellent original trailer, which you can probably YouTube if you're curious.    Anyway, it's still a great film and the best way to watch it outside of a good print in a movie theater, so...    It isn't going to please most film viewers and even many fans, but if you end up appreciating the dark jewel that is LOST HIGHWAY, it's an addictive flavor.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|Raimi commits the ultimate sin of comic book movies - too many villains and too much going on. There are essentially four villains in this movie - Eddie Brock, Venom, The Sandman and Harry Osborn. Trying to squeeze all their stories into a cohesive script must have been a daunting task but could have easily been avoided by not having as many characters to develop in the first place. The result is a valiant but wholly unentertaining attempt to force a storyline from the cluttered lives of the bad guys and the already complicated existence that Peter Parker and M.J. share.    The romance between Peter and M.J. takes center stage once again as we find our hero trying to live a managed life of being a super and boyfriend to a woman who needs full time attention. There are many opportunities for Peter and Aunt May to discuss the love of his life and Raimi makes sure we see them all. Pound for pound, there are just about as many heartfelt discussions during this movie as there where fight sequences.     Topher Grace was a strange choice to play Eddie Brock but he does an admirable job of bringing the character to life. True to the comic, Brock is a journalist competing with Parker however, vying for a job with the Daily Bugle rather than working for rival newspaper Daily Globe. Topher's comedic timing carries him through most of the film and while this Brock may not be entirely what fans are expecting, Topher makes him work in this film.    Why Gwen Stacy shows up in this script at all is complete mystery. Bryce Dallas Howard is an extremely talented actress but Miss Stacy has no place in the story besides acting as \\"the other woman\\", a title easily given to a contrived character.    Kirsten Dunst continues her role as Mary Jane Watson, aspiring actress and all around party girl. There are some fantastic \\"couples\\" moments between the two including a classic restaurant scene that was not only amusing but a great example of the problems faced when being in love with someonemore famous than yourself.      While Thomas Hayden Church may have been a decent choice of actors to portray The Sandman, how the character fits into Peter Parker's life is forced. Loosely based on the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man storyline \\"Sandblasted\\", this Sandman appears to be responsible for the death of Uncle Ben. Hayden Church is a fine actor but The Sandman would have been better served if a full movie had been dedicated to the complex character rather than a measly one fourth.    The special effects for Venom where right on target, however, when an actor signs on to essentially become a CGI based character, the movie goer ie: the person paying good money to see said special effect,is entitled to see that effect in all it's glory, not the face of the actor. The same goes for the ripped mask effect of Spiderman. Rarely in the comic does Spidey have his masked shredded. Clearly it is only to give more \\"face time\\" to Tobey Maguire.  (An excellent example of an actor never showing his true face in a movie is Hugo Weaving in V for Vendetta - kudos to Weaving for putting the character above and beyond his own agenda as an actor!)     The real shame of this movie was in the treatment of Harry Osborn. Raimi and company did a fine job of extracting the manipulative, sadistic and insane side of Harry creating the ultimate foe for Spiderman. If the entire movie had been dedicated to the struggle between Harry, Spiderman and the Venom entity sans Eddie Brock, the audience would have been satisfied. Instead, Harry goes from sinister to sap with very little screen time explanation. It is truly a shame that Raimi did not focus more on the decline and rebirth of Harry as the Green Goblin and design a decent costume for the charcter rather than the not so frightening \\"paint ball mask\\" look. Also, rather than show the deep psychosis that plagued Harry much as it did his father, Harry comes to terms with his evil side not within his own mind but with the help of his butler, a moment better suited for Bruce Wayne than anyone in the Osborn family.     Lastly, never has anyone seen so much song and dance in an action movie. Borderline ridiculous, Raimi's treatment of Spidey gone bad is one part hokey and three parts quirky leaving the audience not sure if they should laugh or stare at the screen blank faced.     Overall, this fan girl is deeply depressed and confused as to how one of the greatest comic book adaptations of our time could have fallen from grace so completely. If there is to be a Spiderman 4, for the love of Stan Lee, don't let Sam Raimi write it!
B000UJ24SC|5.0|A little more polished, a few \\"cathcy-er\\" riffs and the best mix and mastering quality to date. I rocked this on the way to work to day and said to myself \\"Jeremy, this cd is AWESOME\\" and then I wanted to punch somebody.....hard! Seriously, worth the buy.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|In defense of Director Brett Ratner, he did the best he could under the time constraints for this film and the fact that Singer abandoned his \\"child\\" to direct Superman Returns. Writers Kinberg and Penn are seasoned pros, but both came into the film after Singer left and took the original screenwriters, Harris and Dougherty with him to Superman. Basically, they started with nothing and were able to create something just above nothing. Its the same old tired out storyline of good mutants versus evil mutants with a little bit of modern day political agenda thrown in for good measure.     It is not just the poor screenplay that ruins the film. Unfortunately, The Last Stand lacks the acting necessary to carry what is supposed to be one of the most tear-jerking, intense narratives in the X-Men comics, The Dark Phoenix Saga. Typical of comic book films lately, do not expect to find the original story arc in this movie. The dialogue between our heroes is tedious, a slap in the face to readers who know that Marvel Comics have always been cerebral in nature. The special effects are not up to par and even the actor chosen for the minor role of President was horrible. (Cotter Smith where were you?) This film was a huge disappointment and an embarrassment to the X-Men franchise.    There were major faux pas and incongruities in this film. Beware! If you have not seen the film, there are spoilers ahead. Stop reading now and know that if you are a fan of the X-Men series you will be very dissatisfied. Stick with the first two and pretend this film was never put to celluloid.     In an opening scene, we see Professor X walk to the Grey's door. Prof. X was paralyzed before he started the School for the Gifted and so would have been in his wheelchair at this point. Instead of using clever dialogue to establish that we are in the past, the writers and director chose to cop out and remove a prop that should have been present if they had back checked their facts.    The Phoenix kills Scott in the first twenty minutes of the movie. While the Phoenix side of Jean might not get along with Scott, she never would have outright killed him. Not only is this anti-climatic, but clearly, the only reason for his death was that the actor (Marsden) had other obligations i.e.: Superman Returns.     Where was the Phoenix? Jean looks more like a goth girl gone wrong rather than the fiery entity of the Phoenix. We never get to see her rise from the ashes in a blazing inferno. Singer had clearly laid the groundwork in the second movie; her eyes had fire in the them and at the end of the film, we saw the Phoenix fly across the lake. That idea was obviously trashed when the new director took over.    The scenes involving Wolverine and Storm debating/arguing are forced and tiresome. It seems as though the director gave up on accents in this film as Ororo went from having a strained Kenyan accent in the first movie to none at all by the third. Of course, it may be that Ms. Berry had difficulty acting her part or was asked to stop attempting the accent.     The entire middle of the film was unnecessary. There were too many scenes of Magneto rousing the troops, too many cut scenes to the forest (yes we get it, he is in the woods!) too much of the President babbling \\"God Help Us\\" or gathering the troops. Where were the scenes of Jean/Phoenix struggling with the fact that she had just killed her lover/husband and her mentor/father figure?    Why bother introducing characters like Callisto, Psylocke, Spike (who are not mentioned by name) and Archlight if only to kill them off unceremoniously at the end of the film?  Why kill off Jean - again.     One creative point of the movie was Jean's split personality disorder creating the Phoenix rather than an alien entity. It would have been more poignant, however, if Jean had lived, having to face that she had killed the people she loved most in life. There is no real justice or even remotely successful conclusion to this film.
B000IJ79WU|1.0|I have been looking forward to viewing the Richard Donner interpretation of Superman II.  Now that I've seen it, let's just put this in the bargain bin somewhere, shall we?    If this is truly his vision for this film, he was blind.  This is disjointed and the flow is destroyed.  In the original theatrical release, you laughed because of the humor.  With this cut, you laugh AT the movie.    This is a total waste of time, except for the geeks who MUST see what was left out.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Award winner and Oscar nominee for his 2000 screenplay, Memento, Director Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful punch and a believable plot set in a very realistic Gotham City. Nolan brings the audience back to basics and returns to the original concept of Batman as a crime fighter putting down thugs, gangsters and thieves. Christian Bale performs admirably as the sometimes Bi-polar Bruce Wayne, brooding and sullen while at the same time trying to laugh through the pain.     Mixed in with the mobster villains are two distinct antagonists who will be familiar to fans of the comic. Cillian Murphy masterfully plays the Scarecrow, a.k.a. Dr. Jonathan Crane, and stays true the psychotic, fear inducing character created by Finger and Kane for the original Batman series. The Ra's al Ghul storyline serves to condense all of Bruce Wayne's training into one easy to view montage. It is also the first time in film that Ra's makes and appearance. The scenes illustrating Bruce in training with the League of Shadows, remind us that unlike other mutated or alien superheroes, Wayne is just a man; but a man with extreme intellect, physical power and a never-ending supply of money to fund his crusade. In opposition to Wayne's agenda, is the powerful Ra's who believes the best way to create balance is to destroy most of humanity. The two grapple, one believing in the overall goodness of man and the fairness of the system, the other judging man to be inherently evil using a flawed system that will never lead to true justice.    The downside to this film is the forced romantic line between Bruce Wayne and contrived character Rachel Dawes. Holme's acting is not superb in this role and one wonders if she were given a more poignant character from Bruce Wayne's list of loves such as Talia al Ghul, or even Rachel Caspian, would there have been more emotion in her performance. Rachel Dawes is such a flat, one dimensional character that it seems likely that even the finest actress would have difficulties bringing her to life. There is nothing at stake in the relationship and while at one point she appears to be Wayne's better angel, it is Alfred who truly acts as his conscious. When will screen writers learn that women will still go see a sci-fi action films without obligatory romance!    The ever-brilliant Michael Caine as Alfred, was a superb casting choice. Charming, father-like and sometimes heavy handed, Caine delivers the best portrayal of Wayne's caretaker since Alan Napier.     As for the gadgets, the movie takes great care in showing the origins of the bat cave, the suite, and of course the bat mobile. Fan-boys/girls will enjoy the \\"new\\" look of the Caped Crusader's ride based on the art of Frank Miller (The Dark Knight Returns).     It has been a long time since the public had the opportunity to see Batman as he should be: dark, pining, credible and absolutely fantastic!

0670033049|4.0|This one slowed me down on reading Steinbeck. It was long and slow moving. It was overly philosophical. All the characters in this novel are philosophers. The movie was better than the book - the good actors covered the difficult plot. But there is no one to cover the poor reader. I finished it because I like Steinbeck. He lost it on this one in my opinion. He tried to say too much and consequently he made me sleepy. It was somewhat reminiscent of Gun Smoke - big tall character who are very wise and very deep.

B000URDEB0|4.0|I have to admit, I was worried about Nightwish. As a fairly recent fan, I fell in love with the band only to make the distressing discovery that lead singer Tarja Turunen had been dismissed amid some vague controversy. I snapped up all the band's albums, and the more I listened, the more convinced I was that Nightwish would sputter and die without Tarja and her distinctive, operatic pipes. I'm sure the band members themselves had the same fear, which is why Dark Passion Play, their first Tarja-free effort, seems determined to reassure us that they're the same old epic metalists we know and love. Armed with new chanteuse Anette Olzon (who?), they aim to outdo themselves with faux-Gothic bombast and literary imagery. (Guess what the theme of the album is! Hint: It rhymes with \\"The Git and the Gendle Gum.\\") The four guys are more shaggily Scandinavian than ever (Marco Hietala in particular looks like he should be wearing a horned helmet and holding a war axe), and Ms. Olzon looks enough like her predecessor to not appear out of place when vamping in their midst. And the music? It's good.<br /><br />They want us to know their epic metal sound hasn't changed, and so the \\"epic\\" part comes right at the top with \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" -- all thirteen minutes and fifty-four seconds of it -- which tries and almost succeeds to hit that perfect balance between opera and thrashing. Then comes the powerful \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" which, with Hietala howling the catchy refrain, is this album's \\"Wish I Had an Angel.\\" Olzon gets to belt out the third track, \\"Amaranth,\\" which soars far above its incomprehensible lyrics. (That's not how you pronounce \\"caress,\\" sweetie.) The album then settles into a middle section of fine but predictable ballyhoo. Things don't pick up again until the surprisingly restrained, almost folksy ballad \\"The Islander,\\" which hints that we haven't heard all Nightwish is capable of. It's followed by another winner, the all-instrumental \\"Last of the Wilds,\\" which incorporates haunting bagpipes and some particularly lovely programming from keyboardist/songwriter Tuomas Holopainen. The finale track, \\"Meadows of Heaven,\\" threatens to go over the top; its escalating nuclear explosion of bombast is either grotesque or awesome, depending on your reasons for listening to Nightwish.<br /><br />I must make the same complaint as everyone else: Anette Olzon is no Tarja. Her singing voice is powerful but generic, and she's unable to infuse the songs with the same stately, opera-trained gravitas that Tarja brought to even the most lamebrained Gothic piffle. (Seriously, try reciting the lyrics to any Nightwish song without rolling your eyes.) But, my regret over Tarja's departure notwithstanding, I can safely say that Nightwish continues to produce quality metal that reaches across genres. Dark Passion Play is a worthy title.porates haunting bagpipes and some particularly lovely programming from keyboardist/songwriter Tuomas Holopainen.

They would kill Czar Nicolas II, topple the centuries old regime and attempt by way of armed and violent revolution to establish a new democratic government. And John Reed was there to record the event.<br /><br />He was a Harvard graduate.<br /><br />The study of the Union Movement here in the U.S. and consequently the American Communist and Socialist parties, has been purposely neglected and even hidden from the American people. Yet the battle over workers' rights, social justice and human equality brought this nation to the brink of a second Civil War.<br /><br />The battle rages on today in our present political system. Hatred for the American worker and his right to earn a living wage is still prevalent in our political system and throughout the populace.<br /><br />The film story centers on the love story between John Reed and Louise Bryant. I was not aware of the extent of this gripping romance until seeing this movie. It was quite an outstanding love affair and Beatty does a fantastic job in documenting and recording it.<br /><br />It is definitely on the Doctor Zhivago level in story and film making.<br /><br />I bought the film because of its documentary significance and my interest in the American Labor Movement.<br /><br />There are interviews with famous radicals, writers, American Communist and Socialists.<br />Despite all the negative propaganda the American Communists and Socialists and their political parties and organizations did more to promote fair pay, the elimination and exploitation of child labor, good working conditions, sexual equality and free speech here at home than all other groups, parties, armies and social movement combined.<br /><br />I feel that from an historical point of view knowing more about this time period and these famous radicals is crucial to a proper understanding of American history.<br /><br />Our present overall understanding of this time and these people and their movements is convoluted and distorted to say the least.<br /><br />This movie, besides its obvious Russian historical value, is American History.<br />Watch what happened then and get a better understanding of what is happening around you here in America today.<br /><br />PS: Believe it or not I was looking for a copy of this film for years. I had the wrong director/producer and I couldn't find it. Finally I stumbled onto Warren Beatty and there it was.<br /><br />It was done quite well - not many movies in the United States with an American communist hero as the subject matter.<br /><br />Beatty concentrates on the love story involved, which is probably the only way that this subject would ever have been acceptable in America.<br /><br />I wish someone would do the life story ofKarl Marks in the same manner.<br /><br />Marks' life involves a fantastic love story - along with his political, social, and economic disaster. It would make a wonderful movie - but would probably have as much box office success as Reds.<br /><br />I wanted this movie because of the history involved, but the great and human rendition of the love story involved was like frosting on the cake.<br /><br />This was a combination documentary, history lecture, and romantic love story. I would guess that this would have to be considered the greatest production of Beatty's career. It is quite a movie - and done in a balanced, non-judgemental way. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"America On Strike\\"Karl Marks in the same manner.<br /><br />Marks' life involves a fantastic love story - along with his political, social, and economic disaster.

0062515675|5.0|I happened to notice this book at our library due to its unusual title --' The Monk who sold his Ferrari'. To my utter surprise, I discovered after reading a few chapters  that it was a real gem of a book.     So I recommend the book wholeheartedly for any person .. young or old .. who is motivated in finding 'true' meaning in their lives.     Also given the abstractness of topics covered here, I must say the story telling of Sharma makes it very easy to grasp for the average reader. I disagree with many of the early reviewers on this note.    Based on this experience, I will now look out for other books from Robin Sharma.
0142000663|5.0|My wife and I read this book while Hobo-ing around America picking fruits and vegetable in the 70's. We both really liked it. We saw the movie also.<br />I'm am one of those who considers this to be Steinbeck's best. I've read several others by the author and I feel that this was far and away the deepest and the most dramatic. The ending I'm sure some would consider more appropriate in an ancient Greek tragedy but he made his point - one that I have always found very traditional and very difficult to swallow. But it is fundamental.<br />This is without any doubt and American classic. In my opinion nothing that Mr. Steinbeck wrote after The Grapes Of Wrath is in the same class. I know that there are plenty out there who disagree but nevertheless that is my opinion.<br />In this novel, everything is centered on the characters. There is little blatent philosophizing - the story tells the tale. There is no Steinbeck filler material. He had a story he wanted to tell and he told it. It was great.<br /><br />Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\"
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I caught most of this series on BBC America, but the Tevo missed the last episode and I've been waiting with baited breath for the commercial release in the US.  This is so well scripted and acted, it is as good at television gets these days (this and The Wire).  I'd definitely suggest seeing the BBC original over what I imagine will be a mediocre Hollywood adaptation that should be out in late 2008.
0142000671|5.0|This book is another Steinbeck classic. I suppose to people who don't have experience with hard work and difficult times this book makes no sense. But it made a lot of sense to me. It is good dramatic history. I suppose some would consider Lenny a bit much - but I have personally met a million Lennys in my life, he presents no problem with me.<br />A good story on many levels - friendship, compassion, the real world, selfishness and greed, making a living in a tough world and society. I'm sure it will ring a bell with all the poor and struggling - but not to the fat, always had it easy crowd. Good book - buy it.<br /><br />Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:<br /><br />\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\"

B000MRA5NS|5.0|I own approximately 50 BluRays and this ranks right up there with Cast Away and The Departed. Seriously, movies like this are the reason you bought a Blu-Ray in the first place.    Video  5  Audio  5  Extras 3  ReplayValue Very High
B000UBMWG4|5.0|The Blu-ray edition has an absolutely astonishing picture, especially compared to the DVD and even the CAV laserdisc (both of which I own).  The DTHD sound is crystal as well.  Mr. Scott and his team did a fantastic job in the clean up and transfer to HD, and the refinements/additions are all very subtle and blend in perfectly (unlike the gawd-awful job done on the Star Wars films).  Great disc set, and I especially like it as the BD set comes as just the disc set and without all the other stuff (i.e. the metal case and all that).  Highly recommend.
1563899426|4.0|This is the first volume in an award-winning series and it's certainly an original concept. The characters of the classic fables -- fairy tales and stories -- of European folk literature are real \\"people\\" (some are not human in appearance) and they were driven out of their \\"homelands\\" by a force they know only as The Adversary. Now they get by mostly on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, living under the radar and dealing with their own affairs in their own way. King Cole is Mayor-for-Life but doesn't deal much with day-to-day affairs, which are the province of Snow White. Bigby Wolf (\\"Big B.,\\" get it?) is the dour and uncompromising sheriff, or head of security, and many of the stories in the series focus on him. Prince Charming is a leech with three ex-wives -- Snow White, Rose Red (a/k/a Sleeping Beauty and Snow's estranged sister), and Cinderella (Cindy also works undercover for Wolf). Jack (of the beanstalk) is a mediocre con-artist, and etc., etc. Once you catch on to the method behind this tongue-in-cheek madness (which takes about two pages), the stories are (mostly) a lot of fun. This first one concentrates on the apparent murder of Rose Red. No body has been found but there's way too much blood at the scene. Actually (hint, hint . . .), if you examine the scene closely when you first encounter it, perhaps you can work out the mystery for yourself. And the big reveal (the \\"parlor scene\\") is kind of neat. Can the author keep up this level of fun? We'll see.

B000N3ST9I|5.0|machine head was the first metal band I ever got into heavily.  I heard a few here and there (metallica, slayer, pantera, slipknot) but not until I heard Davidian for the first time did I open up my eyes and realize that metal is the greatest thing since sliced bread (and better too).  After hearing davidian, i went out and bought their debut Burn My Eyes and the rest is history.  Although i enjoy ALL their release (yes, even supercharger has a few good songs on it), it was pretty obvious that they fell pretty hard and lost a lot of the magic they had.  Through The ashes of Empires came out and blew us away and let us know that MH is back but this album once again solidifies them has leaders in american metal.  They now use a progressive edge to their music while never forgetting their thrash metal roots.  It's really the perfect combination of all time.      it's just really good and amazing that a band that is as old as machine head just keeps getting better and better by making a full 360 degree turn around.  Don't you wish every band could do this?    Some of the songs (and parts of songs) on this album literally give me chills.  The part where rob says, \\"and i won't pray for you\\" on halo always gives me a shiver as does the ripping solos and duel melodies.  The super thrashy parts towards the later half of wolves also gets to me every time I listen to it.  And the first time i heard Now I Lay Thee Down, i almost pooped my pants.    a huge return to form while also moving fowards.      machine head = legend
B000R5N1MC|5.0|I couldn't believe how good this looked. The look and sound of perfect indeed. Can you believe this movie is 25 years old? Granted the dated computers look strange to us now, but the detail this version contains is incredible.    I also like that there are two versions for those that want just the movies or those that want it all.    WB hit a home run with this. I hope they give this treatment to all of their major catalog titles going forward.
B000A1ENCU|4.0|Quo Vadis is one of the best films of the 1950s and arguably among the greatest released to date. The verbal sparring among Petronius (Leo Glenn), Nero (Peter Ustinov) and Tigellinus (Ralph Truman) would by itself be the backbone of a great movie. Unfortunately, the world currently lacks a quality copy of the film available to the general public. The Korean copy has several problems with loosing audio sync.

B0001GL3K4|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I have only bought 2 pre-recorded movies and this is one of them. I love the casting, the pace, the score - everything. I must admit that a couple of places are over the top cartoonish or caricaturish for me - but it doesn't ruin the film at all. I very rarely watch a movie more than once, and I've seen this one about 5 times, so far! I find it uplifting, but pithy enough in that not every scenario depicted in this movie has a happy ending...
B000W0NO5Q|5.0|I wish there were more books written this way.  I love the story and love the entire series.  I've read the entire series and can't wait for the next book to come out.  This is a relaxing enjoyable read with no violence, profanity or sex.  A welcome change these days.
B0002B15WE|5.0|Every year when Christmas rolls around I like to have some friends over to enjoy a cup of cheer (potent Egg Nog recipe available upon request), put on some nice Christmas music, light some candles, prepare some delicious h'oure dourves, and gather around into my humble but sufficient cinema and watch a wonderful holiday favorite.  This year I'm going to watch Die Hard and to me Christmas just wouldn't be complete without it.<br /><br />John McTiernan's ([[ASIN:B0012GVKW8 Predator]] and [[ASIN:B00008K76U The Hunt for Red October]]) classic action yarn that spawned [[ASIN:B000W4HIY0 three explosive sequels]] never seems to get old, no matter how dated the hair, clothes, and portrayal of hip California cocaine addicts may get.  Die Hard follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) to his quasi-wife's (Bonnie Bedelia) Christmas party in a skyscraper on the west coast.  He is a New York cop whose wife and children moved out west as she takes a great opportunity and adjusts.  Evidently, they are having some marriage problems but it is downplayed just enough.  The building is empty with an exception of the group who is having the Christmas party on one of the highest floors.  \\"Terrorists\\" lead by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take over the building and chaos ensues.  Gruber's plan would've worked out just fine if John didn't get away and slowly begin to take out each of his minions, while tipping off the local authorities.  The feds soon come in and the film blows up into an action classic....and also a Christmas classic.<br /><br />It has perhaps as likable and convincing a hero as you can get in John McClane and Bruce Willis upstages every other action hero by making John not only smart and funny but easy to relate to with very little drama.  It's an effortless performance that I can only compare to Harrison Ford as [[ASIN:B00003CXC5 Indiana Jones]].  Just little fearless remarks coupled with a cynical look on his face make John go from typical good guy to what every boy dreams they could become under these circumstances.  It's fantastical and it's kitschy, but that's forgivable because it's a holiday movie and even more importantly, action is still the priority in Die Hard.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, Die Hard's greatness is completed by its formidable and accessible antagonist, Hans Gruber.  Even after we discover that Hans isn't there as a political terrorist but simply as a thief, he loses absolutely no villain credibility when he responds to Holly McClane's criticism by saying \\"I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane and since I'm moving to kidnapping you should be more polite.\\"  Although we know Hans is capable of vile acts, he actually sees those as merely means to a greater and somehow justifiable end.  His disposition is almost humanitarian and you would imagine him as quite a gentleman outside of the context of the crimes he commits in Die Hard's arc.  In the end though, Hans is a pure sociopath that even the audience is conned into sympathizing with.  I would've wanted him to get away if his opposition was Van Damme, Segal, or Stallone...maybe even Arnold.<br /><br />The supporting cast is another huge strength and helps to highlight the humorous undertone in the film.  The cops and feds are all amusing and rich characters, especially Reggie VelJohnson as the relatable LAPD sergeant Al Powell.  The villains are purely chaotic thugs with just enough variety to make them a bit more than just John's body count.  William Atherton's performance as a reporter is also worth noting, as is John's limousine driver, Argyle.<br /><br />Even the edited for television versions are worth enjoying where the swearing is replaced by wonderfully light little curses like *slug of a ditch*, *melon farmer* and *bad mother cruncher*.  Those of course make it both amusing and accessible to all ages and Die Hard is one of the best examples of hilariously edited television movies.  But that is of course not what makes it a great movie.  I wouldactually argue that Die Hard is the greatest pure action film ever made.

B000EGDB10|4.0|Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team go to Prague in an effort to stop someone from selling a list of all the American covert agents stationed in Eastern Europe.  Unfortunately, the mission turns into an ambush with virtually the entire team getting killed.  The brass figures that Hunt is a traitor who set up his team, so Ethan goes on the run to try and clear his name.      The plot of this movie is somewhat convoluted, though perhaps that is reasonable for a film about espionage and counter-espionage.  Things move along pretty quickly for the and there are no major lulls in the action.  The characters have at least a little depth to them, but this is not a drama built on deep characterization either.  The action sequences mostly work well and the highlight comes halfway through the movie when Ethan and crew break into CIA headquarters in what is easily the most memorable part of the film.  Unfortunately, the big climax at the end involves a train scene that is so unbelievable (even by action movie standards) that it can only be described as laughable.    The other flaw in this movie only counts if you have seen the original TV show or believe that the film should respect the source material in any way.  By turning one of the original characters into a traitor, the producers betrayed everything that character ever stood for.  The only thing the traitor had in common with the original is the name, so the film could have used the exact same script with a different character name to honor the old show but that wouldn't have had the same shock value.  It's a shame that they chose to spit on the show even as they traded on the name recognition to get people into the movie theaters.    If this film is judged on its own merits, setting aside the television series, it's a pretty good action movie.  The ending was a farce, but the movie was solid up to that point with some scenes achieving true excellence.  I would recommend it to those who never saw the original show or can set their knowledge of it aside and just take the movie for what it is.

0783225903|4.0|If you happen to like Terry Gilliam films and Monty Python you will really like this film. I purchased the special edition with lots of extra bits... I absolutely love anything weird and strange. The film is very disjointed but the cameo appearances of Robert Deniro and Katherine Helman are hilarious. It is odd from beginning to end.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|This was some fantastic entertainment, but don't look to it for historical accuracy. It's Hollywood-ized, down to the re-writing of history and the costumes, but it's still fun to watch. I recommend it if you're looking for an inspirational historical fantasy flick!

B000VWYJ86|2.0|I love the Jasom Bourne films so much, and I couldn't wait for this to come out in the theatres... but the crazy camera-running-after-the-action-scenes causing the constant bumpy image seen through most of the last half of the movie made me stop watching the movie while in the theatres. :( It was horrible, and it took me a while to be able to continue to watch it. I don't mind the occasional shakiness, but this film's camera men ruined this otherwise fantastic movie! :(
B000VNMMQG|4.0|This is a fine film with a good cast.  Anything with Ioin Gruffudd is usually good.  He was great in the Hornblower series.  This film deals with the issue of abolition, and how it started in England long before it was ever known in the States.  Fortunately this film does not become too preachy on a topic which is normally quite moralistic in tone.  The perspective here is more on the inner-workings of politics and how Wilberforce had to work the English parliamentry system to achieve his goal.  One must give the English system credit for passing such a measure without bloodshed, something which required a bloody Civil War in this country some 60 years later!<br /><br />The main interest for me in this film however is the massed band sequence at the end just before the credits.  The sight and sound of the bands is quite fascinating, even if not historically accurate. The tune \\"Amazing Grace\\" has long been associated with the Scottish pipes, although it is doubtful that it was played in the fashion shown here.  For one, pipers in the Scottish regiments were generally not known to play together until sometime later in the 19th century where they eventually combined with the drums to produce the sight and sound we know so well today.<br /><br />The military bands shown also would not likely have combined to play in this manner at that time.  The modern assocation we have today with the bands and pipes combination must come from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who made their version of \\"Amazing Grace\\" so famous in 1972.  The legend of that recording which those two bands of the regiment produced lives on today and even gets picked up in movies like this!  Still, the sight and sound of these bands in period unifroms, and with period instrumentation is fascinating for the true student of military music like myself.<br /><br />British military bands of the period rarely combined in larger ensembles than their own band, and on the rare occasions they did the results were often not promising.  We are reminded of the famous incident from the Crimean War where all the regimental bands tried playing \\"God Save The Queen\\" and did so in different keys and arrangements!

B000PFU7OO|3.0|Does anyone know what song Marketa Irglova sings when she's walking at night after getting the batteries for the cd player?
B000EULJLU|1.0|I'm a long time Tool fan. I like tool.. This pabulum is 4 songs tool - the rest junk. Just because I'm a Tool fan doesn't mean I'm going to be all 'artsy' and say Tool has matured. If they have matured they have matured into crap.    The CD opens GREAT.. the first 2 songs are class. Updated and revised kick butt Tool. Then the 3rd \\"song\\" comes and it's like \\"Whale Music.\\" Which is fine if you're a whale looking for a mate. I'm not though, I'm human and I'm already married. Thinking this must be an anomoly I move to the 4th. Which is 11.. yes count them 11 minutes of MORE WHALE MUSIC!    Then we have song 5 \\"the pot\\" which everyone should know. Classic tool - revised - kick butt. A golden reprieve from the otherwise useless 17 MINUTES of PURE CRAP I was forced to listen to while searching for the band formerly known as Tool.    Track 6 is a 1 minute long interlude of American Indian head-hunting chant music. A purely random entry by Tool to honor the tough Indian Warrior of yesteryear. Atleast that's my assumption.    7 - Crap.. undefined crap. Don't even know how to describe it waste-of-time junk.    8 - Pretty good song.. Really good. Also the last Tool song on this CD.    9 - Junk, 10 - Junk .. they actually play Bongos in 10. Bongos. I felt like I was in the movie Beach Blanket Bingo or whatever that my Mom used to watch. I was about to yell \\"Lets put the pig on the fire!..\\" and then I realized I was in my car listening to crap.    11 - some guy got his hand caught in a blender made of keyboards and produced more crap.    Bottom line.. If you're a whale, or an American Indian Warrior circa 1842, or one of those people that like Bongo music this CD is for you.    If you're a Tool fan you should avoid at all costs or you'll be forced to tell your friends how far they have gone and how much they have matured while quietly shelving this piece of slag between the letters Crap and Junk.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is great! I never was the type of girl that liked Britney Spears. Even when she was all the rave with \\"...One More Time\\" and the others...I still didn't like her. She just wasn't my cup o' tea. But this WHOLE ALBUM is awesome. So danceable! And I think people were setting out to hating this album before she even made it. No one likes how she lives her life. But that does not matter on this album. My goodness, it's amazing. I totally didn't expect it when I got it, but I'm glad I have it. This WILL BE BUMPED in the car!    The beats are so nice, you can't help but to like it. People that are giving bad reviews are judging her by how she chooses to live her life...more so, they are judging her by how she chooses to play the cards that were dealt to her. I wish everyone would stop acting so friggin perfect...as if we don't all make mistakes, have regrets or wish we had it to do all over again! Just because celebrities have a lot of money and are on magazines doesn't make them some kind of super-human race. They still hurt and bleed like the rest of us. I think they hurt even more than us because they think their money can solve every problem when we all know that's not true.    At the end of the day, this album is probably the best she's put out as far as EVERY SONG on it being pretty damn good. It's really hard for any artist to do that, and I think Ms. Spears has accomplished that with Blackout.
0385334206|3.0|This is the first Vonnegut novel I have ever read, and I picked it up not knowing quite what to expect. This novel plumbs the psyches of a couple relatively twisted characters and brings them into contact with each other through some nice plot machinations. There is a cloud over this novel. A sense of foreboding is spurred on by the Author's dropping multiple hints and suggestions as to the unpleasantness that is about to occur towards the end of the novel. Daily life in America, particularly the Midwest, is skewered relentlessly as the Author tackles issues of bigotry, violence, stardom, and the corrosive nature of secrets. He also liberally sprinkles thought provoking Sci-Fi tidbits throughout in the guise of his main character's novels and book ideas. This book reminded me a little of both Fight Club and American Psycho, in that the main characters are almost irredeemably crazy and getting more so, yet they continue on with their lives, tainting people they meet while wandering through an almost oblivious world. At times the satire is laid on thick, and there can be a heavy hand when various social ills are expounded upon over and over again. I also found the book to be more thought provoking and disturbing than comical, which is not a criticism. I will read more by Vonnegut based on my experience here.

140120306X|5.0|Even better than the first two League mini-series. Moore and O'Neill have packed so much in to this book; the denseness of the Kerouac stream of consciousness is difficult at first but a colleague suggested reading it aloud - he's right, you really get the rhythms and the meaning is clearer this way.    The James Bond cypher takes the \\"blunt instrument\\" mysoginist from the first Fleming novel and develops the ruthlessness alarmingly. Other cameos are carried off with humourous aplomb. If only DC hadn't been such arseholes this would have included a CD and other goodies. Roll on the absolute edition.
B00005JPNW|4.0|What a bum rap this picture has taken from the right wing and people just slavering for its failure.  It's been knocked for all the wrong reasons.  The most severe criticism, I think, is that the storytelling is rushed.   Chris Weitz (a salute to Chris) had so much to pack in, and he should have been allowed at least another twenty minutes to fill out the story and give the audience a few moments to breathe and just take in the marvelous invention of the production design and the variety of Pullman's imaginings.  The plus side wins, though.  Weitz firmly prevents the kind of shallow overacting that plagues fantasy epics; the characters, even the animated ones, feel like real people.  The casting is the best of any fantasy film since The Wizard of Oz.  Really.  Kidman, who has been getting dumped on for bad choices lately, brings something to Mrs Coulter not even present in the books: a note of piercing, authentic tragedy.  Dakota Blue Richards is a natural, and makes Lyra appealing in a way the sometimes tiresome Lyra of the books is not.   The CGI is superb, the most perfectly integrated dramatically of any yet seen (even the sainted LOTR).  I sincerely hope Wietz is allowed to film the rest of the series.      ***    January 4, 2008: a few days after this film was released, David Germain of AP labeled it a flop.  Four weeks later, it has earned almost 63 million in the US and a whopping 195 million internationally, for a total of 258 million worldwide.  By comparision, Enchanted, which has been playing for 6.5 weeks has earned 226 million and Sweeney Todd which has been open 2 weeks has earned a pathetic 33 million.  What's going on here?  By what stretch of the imagination is The Golden Compass a flop?  Does David Germain has a little Nicole problem?  So far, nobody has labeled Enchanted a flop, or Sweeney Todd a flop.  But, then, they don't challenge the patriarchy.   Also on Huffpost, Philip Slater neartly summarized what this is all about: sexism.  See his post of 12/19 for the lowdown on male critics, and religious bigotry, and how they have conspired to trash this fine film -- a film which continues to hang on in the top fifteen box office draws despite fierce competition.  Nicole Kidman and Chris Weitz should sue.
0143036238|3.0|It's a legendary and outstanding claasic but let's discuss not the novel itself but the book and it's quality. The cover is very nice, but the pages inside are of very poor quality.... If I had known it would be that kind of, I would definitely buy a better edition.... Though observing it's low prince, I should have had more or less clue about the quality of the book... Once again I confirm that nobody argues about the novel which is really remarkable piece of work...

0743298039|3.0|Diane Setterfield's debut novel was often compared to Zafon's \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\". I wanted to see if this comparison is close to reality - I suspected it not to be and I was not mistaken. The similarities between the two novels end on the main character growing up among books.<br /><br />The main protagonist and narrator of \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\", Margaret Lea, is an only daughter of the bookshop owner. She is in her late thirties, single, living with her parents, and devoted to her two passions: books and biographies. When she receives a letter from a bestselling, intriguing and mysterious writer, Vida Winter, inviting her to write the author's biography, she is excited and wary at the same time. After all, Vida Winter is deceitful, creative, and known to give fictional accounts of her past to journalists. Margaret, after doing lots of research, decides to visit Vida in her house, where she is convinced by the writer to accept the invitation and write the biography, because of a curious parallel between Vida's and her own life.<br /><br />Margaret starts to live in Vida's big, old, overwhelming house and gets so much involved in Vida's story that she decides to follow some leads on her own - she travels to Vida's family home, searching for clues. She discovers many secrets and as she digs out Vida's past, her own memories unfold.<br /><br />\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a novel deliberately stylized on a Gothic tale. After all, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is quoted not for nothing... It also reminded me of \\"Rebecca\\", but Daphne du Maurier's creation is much more appealing. I read \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" with ease and some pleasure, but the ending was disappointing. I was left with the feeling that the plot could have been led in a better, not so banal, direction and that the different threads, including the main mystery of Vida Winter, could have been more interestingly finalized. There is a big crowd of very colorful, sometimes even too weird characters who at the end play marginal roles, which is a pity. It looks like the author set out to write a bestseller (well, she succeeded, no doubt) and introduced so many possibly intriguing points, that she lacked invention to connect everything in a satisfactory way and weave a coherent story. Because the concept is already not original (although it is a good idea to revive a Gothic novel, many writers did it more skillfully), I give this book three stars..

B000002J29|5.0|I bought my own copy of the vinyl in 1978 after my brother made me listen to his copy. I would put it on the turntable, turn off the lights and listen to it from beginning to end laying down on the floor with my head in between the speakers (I did not have a headset). I would imagine that I was at the show. SECONDS OUT is, quite simply put, the greatest Progressive Rock Live album ever recorded! The band is a the top of its game (despite Peter Gabriel's departure). Phil Collins and Chester Thompson perform what I consider to be, by  far, the best live drumming I have ever heard, especially on SQUONK, DANCE ON A VOLCANO and LOS ENDOS. Phil does a surprisingly good job taking over the microphone, Steve Hackett's magic guitar gives the right atmosphere and Tony, well, is just Mr. Cool on keyboards. Absolutely superb! I could not be at the show but someone (God Bless him or her) put the footage of the show on YOUTUBE, including SUPPER'S READY, the ultimate Prog Rock song. Buy this album. You will not regret it!
0525950079|3.0|When I read the original book, Pillars of the Earth, many years ago, I enjoyed the book, I would like to have seen a sequel.    Now that the sequel, World Without End, is here, I think that it needs to go back to the editing room--for a bit of a reality check--a 14th century reality check.    When one reads a historical novel, one enjoys suspending reality--going back to the time, the era, the feeling of being in that time. In this novel, Follett has forgotten that his characters live in the 1300s, and not the 21st century. He jerks the reader away from the 1300s, by giving his characters 21st century insights and personalities, and by injecting 21st century value orientations and socio-politicical awareness that would have been out of place, and are totally historically inaccurate.    For example, The casual way that the elder sister of Caris is shown to be accepted in her town, despite an illigitimate pregnancy--and, the description of Wulfric as \\"hot\\", totally disrupt a reader's immersion into 14th century life. Those are just two examples of the rupture of the time, taking the reader back to the future.    I also think that these kinds of 21st century insight are given only to the women in the novel, while the men are portrayed as slightly more intelligent than a block of wood.    I think that I would have enjoyed the book more had there been more careful attention to the details that make a work of fiction a seamless work in which one could immerse oneself without the continuous disruptions that distract a person from the 14th century back to our own time.
B0000026JR|3.0|I LOVE early Riot, especially the classic one-two punch of \\"Narita\\" and \\"Fire Down Under\\", but Rhett's \\"Restless Breed\\" hair metal posing turned me off so much I gave up until earlier this fall. I knew there was other, later, better Riot out there but simply had too much other, already known to be better, music to spend my $$ on.<br /><br />So I finally got this based on all the 5 star recommendations here on Amazon and all I can say is I am glad I bought a used copy and you people must not have very high standards at all!! Based on the assumption that \\"Fire Down Under\\" IS 5 stars and \\"Narita\\" and \\"Army of One\\" are 4, this is 3 stars AT BEST!!!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad, better than the 83-86 poser stuff but, with ALL the great stuff out there to spend my time listening to, I doubt I'll be listening to this much! And, being 88, you can still hear the hair metal in it. And I don't really like the singer - WAY too helium voiced, reminds me of the original Fates Warning singer. Overall, just a little too close to \\"B-budget Queensryche clone\\" for my tastes!! Considering they had their own, unique style in the early 80s I have to wonder why they even decided to go in this direction!<br /><br />Heck, the 2006 release, \\"Army of One\\", is FAR superior to this, too bad Amazon lists it as an overpriced Import only (even the used copies are $18-25!!). You can definitely hear the influence of recent musical happenings in the music on that one!!<br /><br />Bottom line: For hardcore Riot fans or diehard hair metal fans only. And even if you ARE a hardcore Riot fan, getting this before \\"Fire Down Under\\", \\"Narita\\" and \\"Army of One\\" is downright CRIMINAL!<br /><br />On a sidebar - yesterday I read that the original singer, Guy Speranza (the good one), died of cancer!! So, between him and Rhett Forester getting murdered.....seems like they have a Spinal Tap drummer thing going on....not sure I'd want to be a singer in this band :)
0064407667|5.0|There are three kids in this story, Violet, Klaus and Sunny. They all have different interests. Violet is the oldest in the family. She is 14, and likes to invent stuff. Klaus is the second oldest. He likes to read. Everything he reads, he remembers. Sunny is very young. She likes to bite things.     Their parents died in a fire which destroyed the whole house. A banker named Mr. Poe took the kids to this horrible man named Count Olaf. They got a great number of horrible chores every day. But Mr. Poe thinks Olaf does not do anything wrong. So one day, Count Olaf decided to put on a play to get his hands on the fortune. And the play was about a marriage and Violet was the bride and Count Olaf was the groom. And Sunny was locked up in a cage. So Klaus decided to rescue Sunny first. Then as soon as he got Sunny out of there, Violet was coming down the aisle. When the signing sheet came, Violet wrote with her left hand so she was safe. Now Mr. Poe knows how horrible he is. My favorite part of The Bad Beginning was when Violet foiled Count Olaf's plot. My mom enjoys this book too, so I think it's a book for all ages.     By Lydia
B0010X8NF0|3.0|So how many Wes Anderson films have you seen?  If Darjeeling is your first, you may well give more than three stars to this story of three brothers more or less trying to reconnect as they more or less search for their mother on a slow train through a lot of India.  If, as with me, it is your fifth you may find that the characters' quirkiness has become just a bit too pat, that the meandering plot twists feel arbitrary not right and that the film might have been better titled Wes and the Gang Go to India. That's not to say that Darjeeling fails to entertain.  It is splendidly shot, very well-acted, funny, and sometimes moving.  For one fifteen or twenty minute segment that begins with an attempted rescue in a flooded river, it achieves grace and wisdom, and is as good as anything Anderson has directed.  It also has a priceless opening sequence with Bill Murray and, as often in Anderson's films, Anjelica Huston bringing both common sense and majesty to the mix.  But even with those assets, Darjeeling feels more canned than true.
0810993139|5.0|The main characters in this book are Greg, his best friend Rowley and Greg's baby brother Manney.  The setting of this story takes place at Greg's middle school and at home.  The theme of this book is what it's like to be a boy in middle school.      This book talks in a funny way about the good and bad part of being a kid.  My favorite part of the book is when Greg has to babysit his little brother, who's a real pain in the neck and he has to watch all Manney's cartoons.  I also like the part where Manney draws all over Greg's bedroom door and doesn't even get in trouble.  This book is very funny and any boy would enjoy reading it.    By Alexander
0525950079|5.0|I'm not sure how to begin, except to say that this book is by far my favorite.  I loved Pillars, and for the longest time it was THE book to recommend to friends who were looking for something new to read.  But, in many ways this one tops Pillars....the character development is brilliant, the writing style brilliant...well, it's just brilliant!  I found parts of Pillars hard to get through, and truthfully, those parts were only those which included detailed descriptions of building techniques of the period, and descriptions of vaulted ceilings, window height, stone selection, etc.  Other than that, the book was fantastic.  But this one....every chapter has a new and exciting development, new and unexpected things happening.  How he was able to intertwine these characters so well, in such a believable way...to see their world develop,their dreams pursued, hopes dashed, loves won and lost....I was eager for each page, and now I'm left hungry for more.  Please don't let so much time pass between books...write us another one soon!  Thank you, thank you for such a wonderful reading experience Mr. Follett!  Encore...encore!
0142402532|5.0|A Little girl named Matilda      The book I am reviewing is Matilda by Roald Dahl. Matilda is a story about a little girl named Matilda who is mistreated by her parents.   She is very smart and wants to go to school. When her parents finally let her go she meets some very interesting people.    The story is about Matilda, her parents, her teacher and her principal.   Most of the book takes place in Matilda's house, her teacher's house, her principal's and her school. One of the themes in this story is that life isn't always easy. One of my favorite things in this book are that good things happen to the good people and the bad people too. I really recommend this book for anyone that is looking for a good and funny story.

I bought VCTOTW about 2 months ago, and since then my family has praised me for the being the next chef of the family. I gained so much confidence from my baking that I bought Vegan with a Vengence and La Dolce Vegan, and it's been a whole new me ever since. For Christmas I even asked for cooking gear! I brought my new vegan cupcakes to a work function and didn't tell anybody that they were mine (they are always scared I'm going to sneak tofu on them) and everyone loved them. When I told them they were vegan no one believed me. My personal favorites are the smores cupcakes, the chocolate stout and the peanut butter cupcakes. Thank you so much!

B00005JPS9|5.0|We saw this in 3-D and afterwards, the strangely disembodied and exaggerated bodily movements of the \\"motion captured\\" actors had us walking out of the theater in a Martha Graham-style line of weirdly extended arms, twisty necks that seem always to be craning up towards the moon, and slow extensions of the legs, trying to emulate Angelina Jolie's long slinky walk along the edge of the underground pool full of jewels from which she swam, in her admirable bare feet that were oddly shaped exactly like a pair of flesh colored high heels.<br /><br />One of our party, Tim, deduced that the ancient Danes must have invented not only high heels but also what he called the \\"sarcastic clap.\\"  You know, when all of the interest is centered on one party making a grandiose speech or striking a vain attitude, and then, from a corner where you least expect it, you hear the sound of one person clapping extremely slowly--one clap at a time--as they stride forward towards the unctuous one, clapping sarcastically Tim says, though I would perhaps call it the \\"ironic clap.\\"  Done well this is always the highlight of any movie that employs it, and we've all seen quite a few.  Well, the screenwriters of BEOWULF must love this device for the \\"sarcastic clap\\" gets used three times--a record in any movie, be it animated or live action!  John Malkovich was born to enact the \\"sarcastic clap\\" and he does so perfectly in this film.<br /><br />As for the scenes in which Robin Wright Penn and Alison Lohman stand side by side, wife and mistress, mourning over where did they go wrong with their man, to me they proved that like so many of us, Beowulf's screenwriters got many of their dramatic effects from the musical CHESS, written by Tim Rice and Bjorn and Benny from ABBA.  All ABBA fans remember the song \\"I Know Him So Well,\\" a duet for wife and mistress in which each boasts how she was the one to know the guy the best, and each then is forced to admit, he didn't really care for either of us!  Very sad, and Whtiney Houston has a duet version with her own mother, which I always thought creepy for some reason.<br /><br />\\"Looking back I could have played it differently<br />Won a few more moments who can tell?<br />But it took time to understand the man;<br />Now at least I know I know him well.\\"Houston has a duet version with her own mother, which I always thought creepy for some reason.    \\"Looking back I could have played it differently  Won a few more moments who can tell?

B000WTNCQS|4.0|First off, I wasn't that impressed with the sound quality of the remaster - it certainly didn't seem 50% louder as one reviewer wrote, and other than pumping up the bass, I didn't hear much difference from the original CD. More importantly, I recently found a bootleg DVD of their 1987 performance in Syracuse, NY, professionally filmed but never officially released. Great performance, excellent sound, and a longer show, including \\"Where the streets\\". I think the reason it was never released was because Bono's arm was in a cast which sort of stymied his movement and performance (physically, NOT vocally). Definitely a show worth finding!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I began watching it as a kid.  After seeing all four Karate Kid films, the original is still the very best.  This should not be viewed as an action movie for martial arts excitement.  While the film contains that, its is quite mild and limited, focusing mostly as a drama with a terrific story.  A film for all ages and families, though cheesy at times, there are elements of the film that will remind us of the difficulties of growing up through school.<br /><br />Daniel Laruso is new to the L.A. area, who traveled across country with his mother to settle in their new apartment.  The new kid in school, Daniel finds it quickly frustrating with bullies surrounding him every instant, and a love interest in a girl who was once one of the bullies' former lovers.  After getting beat up over and over, Daniel has enough and wants to move back home.  Fortunately, an older and wise handyman named Mr. Miyagi finds out about Daniel's dilemma, and the two spend most of the film bonding in a special light, despite their unique differences.  Daniel not only learns about karate, but the true meaning of karate, and the keys to finding balance in one's life.  Cheesy for today's standards, but still worth a watch, as we can all relate to growing up in a similar high school scenario of difficulties.<br /><br />Though not an extremely famous list of cast names, Pat Morita, Ralph Machio, Elisabeth Shue and Martin Kove will always be most famous for their roles in this film.  Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi has made a profound impact in movie history.  Though passed away recently, he will always be remembered as the famous \\"wax on, wax off\\" man.  Though Martin Kove went on to play in many B-action martial arts movies, it is Karate Kid where he got to shine the most.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|I purchased This before hearing samples or reading reveiws, then before it came I read some reviews, I got nervous, wondering what I had gotten myself into. Don't listen to those bad reviews. Sure he sounds different, but that does'nt mean it's bad. I also ordered Modern times, Dylan 3 discs deluxe, Highway 61 revisited and blonde on blonde. I am so glad I did. You can never go wrong with Dylan he just went back to where he started, loving blusey,laid back music, He is a great Talent! I can't wait untill another one comes out. I have been a fan for years but this is the first music I have bought and I don't know what took me so long.
B00023B1LC|4.0|Matt Damon is Jason Bourne - an agent of the U.S. government who has lost his memory, yet retains a great deal of intelligence and martial arts skills.  The CIA believes he has failed a mission he was sent to accomplish in Europe.  When they learn he is alive, they quickly use a league of agents to hunt down Bourne before time runs out on the clock, and the men involved with the screw up get in real trouble.  The plot gets very detailed throughout the film, but this is the basic idea.<br /><br />Though there are some nice fight scenes and a great car chase in the film, the plot is always moving along, so there is little need for an abundance of action to keep things rolling.  I love films like this, cause when there is action, it actually holds some meaning when it occurs.  Bourne and the woman he accompanies (who the CIA is also after) share a great chemistry - both as characters and as actors.  The remainder of the cast is solid, and includes stars such as Julia Styles and Clive Owen - both who actually player lesser characters in the film, though nice to see.<br /><br />Best thing about this film is the non-stop running of Bourne.  He rarely gets time to stop for a breather, therefore making this film a very easy one for the viewer to stay alert to.  There is a detailed plot that takes a lot to follow every step of what's going on, but it is just as easy to watch if you prefer to sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Compared to James Bond in a sense, Bourne actually feels much more realistic.  While Bond is more fun and action packed in the long run, Bourne gives us a greater taste of reality.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 4<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4

B000VDDDVO|5.0|That short message is the basis of the story told in Frank Capra's brilliant 1946 film, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". Arguably, one of the best films of all time, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" tells the story of a fictional character named George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart, 1908-1997) who lives in the small, fictional town of Bedford Falls, NY.  George, as a young boy (played by Robert Anderson), dreamed of world travel and being an archetect, but the death of his father (Samuel S. Hinds, 1875-1948) forces him to remain in Bedford Falls in order to manage the Bailey Savings & Loan.  Though feeling trapped, he eventually marries Mary (Donna Reed, 1921-1986) and has four children.  Barely able to take care of his family, George is tempted by offer for a high-paying job by his chief rival,  the unscrupulous Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore, 1878-1954), but rejects it.  Finally, the pressure becomes too much for George when his absentminded Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell, 1892-1962) loses money that was supposed to be deposited in Potter's bank and George is accused of embezzlement.  Feeling completely lost & helpless, George decides to plunge from a bridge into a dark & cold river; but suddenly, someone else falls in and George instinctively jumps in to save the other man's life.  The other man, however, is no man at all; but a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers, 1874-1965) sent to save George.  Not believing that Clarence is an angel, George wishes that he had never been born and Clarence grants him his wish.  When George returns to Bedford Falls, what he finds is the unseemly town of Pottersville: filled with nightclubs, pawnshops and other disreputable businesses.  Further, no one knows George anymore.  Horrified, George desperately attempts to find Mary, his children and his mother; but what he finds only gets George into trouble with the people who had once known him including his two dearest friends: the taxi driver Ernie Bishop (Frank Faylen, 1905-1985) and police officer Bert (Ward Bond, 1903-1960).  Will George get his life back, along with his wife, children & friends?  You'll just have to watch (if you haven't already) this classic film to find out.    With a brilliant story, wonderful direction thanks to Frank Capra (1897-1991) and superb acting, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" remains one of the most loved & watched films of the last 60 years.  The filmed earned 5 Oscar nominations in 1947, including Jimmy Stewart for Best Actor and Frank Capra for Best Director and for Best Picture.  Other memorable characters include George's mother (Beulah Bondi, 1888-1981), Mr. Gower (H.B. Warner, 1875-1958), George's daughter Zuzu (Karolyn Grimes), George's brother Harry (Todd Karns, 1921-2000) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame, 1923-1981).  Overall, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" gets a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to everyone.  Though originally filmed in black and white, the film was colorized several years ago. While some don't approve of the colorization of older films, it's nice to see this DVD package offering both the original black & white version, as well as the colorized version for people to watch.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Pedro Almodovar is an important Spanish director.  He was nominated for the Best Director Oscar for \\"Talk to Her (Hable con Ella)\\" in 2002 and won the Oscar that year for Best Original Screenplay.  For \\"Volver\\" (to return) he won the Argentinean Film Critics Association award for Best Foreign Film.  The star is Penelope Cruz as Raimunda.  She was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar & British Academy Award for her performance.  She shows many levels as the complicated woman who is doing the best she can with her limited resources.  Carmen Maura plays the mother Irene.  Maura was awarded Best Supporting Actress at the Goya awards in Spain.  Her performance is varied, gutsy, with a no-frills costume and makeup job compared to the glamorous Raimunda.  Lola Duenas as the sister/daughter Sole conveys a wide-eyed innocence throughout her performance, most hilariously in the scene where she thinks she's seen a ghost.  I particularly enjoyed Blanca Portillo as the shorthaired Augustina who likes to smoke marijuana most matter-of-factly in front of her family.  Yohana Cobo plays the daughter Paula and does a good job with a deeply complicated part.  Without going into specifics, I found a plot similarity between Cruz and Faye Dunaway in [[ASIN:B000022TSH Chinatown]].  Chus Lampreave plays Tia (Aunt) Paula with an addled elderly viewpoint that serves the story humorously without coming across as derogatory to older people.  Antonio de la Torre plays Raimunda's husband Paco.  De la Torre won the Best Supporting Actor Goya Award for the gay-themed \\"Azuloscurocasinegro\\" that I'm not aware has been released in the States.  His screen time is brief, but seemed very real.  Obviously, his character is dark, but he performs well.  Yolanda Ramos is hilarious in her cameo as the TV announcer.  This movie won Best Foreign Language Film Award from the London Film Critics.  I found the story to maintain my interest as the film went in unexpected directions.  The performances were all first class.  Enjoy!class.  Enjoy!
B00005176F|5.0|Really, there should be no question about the quality of this record. It features over an hour of the most sublime pop music ever recorded. Every track is a stand-out, but particular highlights include the Euro-disco of \\"Girls and Boys,\\" the orchestral grandeur of \\"The Universal,\\" the gospel-tinged ballad \\"Tender,\\" and the grunge parody \\"Song 2,\\" better known Stateside as 'whoo-hoo.'   While diehards may have some qualms with the track selection (NOTHING from [[ASIN:B000002USH Modern Life Is Rubbish]], save the single version of \\"For Tomorrow,\\" made the cut), this album is probably the best starting place for newcomers to the Blur discography.  From here, the first place to go is Modern Life Is Rubbish, which is not adequately represented here, but still key to understanding the band's discography.
B000JVT09C|2.0|As in all my reviews, I'm not going to review the movie.  I'm going to review the picture quality and the overall presentation of the disc...But if I had to review the movie, I would give it a 6/10.  The movie was ok, but for a fan like me whose been obsessed with this film for years, checking updates on the movie, watching the videos of Bryan Singer during production, posting on BlueTights.net forums, I WAS SEVERLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FILM.  But, like I said, I'm not going to review the movie.  Anywayz, I had to get the movie on HD because I am a Superman fan.  I have a PS3, and it was my first HD movie.  I don't see why everybody here is giving such praise on the quailty of the video.  The video wasn't top notch and I would not use this as a demo to show off.<br /><br />I'm using a HDMI cable, so I'm getting 1080p.  The video is very soft and doesn't look HighDef to me.  The film crew used HD cameras to film the movie, but I don't see that result in this transfer.  I'm very sure if I pop in the DVD version, I will get the same detail (this is an assumption).  When I watch HighDef, I want to say \\"WOW\\" sometimes, and that is how I know this is HighDef (ex. Spider-Man 3 or Planet Earth).  I did not get that with Superman Returns.  I mean, it is a clean transfer, but what exactly is so highdef about it?  One scene that I can maybe show you an example is the time we see Lex's yacht in the ocean during the storm in the beginning of movie when they are searching for the Fortress of Solitude, right after the scene where we see Superman fainting in Martha Kent's arms and we get that wide shot of the ship in Smallville.  The scene of the yacht in the ocean was sooooooo soft and there was no HighDef detail whatsoever.  I want to see the wrinkles, and amount of craters on everybody's faces for me say \\"Wow, now this is High Definition\\".<br /><br />I can't review the audio since I don't have a sound system.<br /><br />I love the extras, and I love the fact that it's on the same disc as the movie.  It's a BluRay, it has the capacity..... why not?  Some movies don't do that for some reason, and if they don't, than why do they even mention the amount of capacity.  Anywayz, the extras are great, they go into great detail about the preproduction, post production, and casting.  I wish they included the Bryan Singer's blogs, but hey, no complaint here on extras.<br /><br />Conclusion, an ok transfer of the film which I don't see me using as a demo for HIGHDEF.  But, is it a must buy, for a Superman fan.... yes, but for a non fan or somebody that greatly hated the film....... I still say buy because it's SUPERMAN.
B000TGJ80I|1.0|This version does not come with spanish subtitles. It stinks. What happened with you Sony Pictures? Why did you include italian subtitles and not spanish subtitles?
B000TFINY6|5.0|Excellent transfer for an amazing season of Lost.  The colors stand out, the scenery is amazing, and this set is a great demo to show off your BluRay player.  Think of the BluRay/HD-DVD edition of \\"Planet Earth\\", but with better entertainment/actors/plot.  There are so many scenes where you would go \\"WOW\\" and be happy with the BluRay set.  The bright/contrast levels are great and consistent.  There are a good amount of extras, and there is a section for \\"questions answered\\" where it's like a recap for beginners to understand Season 3.  The video is sharp, you see everybody's facial flaws and craters.  Oh, and Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austin) looks AMAZING in HighDef.  Not only the video transfer is top notch, but the cover is EXCELLENT.  The way the CD's are organized is incredible, and I like the fact that they have 5 - 6 episodes per BluRay disc.  If you want to compare the set setup to the setup of Heroes, where you open the cover that stretches to a like a mile, this \\"Lost\\" BluRay set is by far better.  The slip cover is great too, you can insert the box and than CLOSE IT, unlike the DVD set for Season 1 and 2, where it can easily slide out of the slip cover.  Finally we get to view Lost how it should be, in true 1080P. A must own set, at a reasonable price considering the content, well worth it.
0393327655|3.0|I knew what to expect but was taken aback by what seems  a rather vitriolic way of making the author's point.  The examples of the horrors of what faith can do are extreme and they leave no space for the reader to recall that faith has also done a lot of good things over the centuries.  Still, it is a good review of what tends to be forgotten,namely how much religion has held back progress, and how difficult it is for a religious person to reconcile dogma with objective reality.  This book fills a crying need, but it takes a strong stomach to read it. Without the authors intention it could come across as another way of being dogmatic.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This is litterally THE best seies in the entire world of television shows!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is exciting, sad, funny, heartwarming, and just what you want if you are in need of some drama. The actors adapt to the chatracters so well.

B000929AJQ|5.0|worth owning but have to say the track called capital g, is good but when it starts out  well can you say hee hee, the way you make me feel, it really turns me on, lol
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a great film.  I think of it as the New Millenium Princess Bride.  But guys, it's a fantasy - and if you're somebody into Lord of the Rings, Narnia, etc., this is not necessarily for you.  It's a sweeping, romantic narrative fairytale adventure where swordplay is for chivalry, not to defeat the dark forces of evil; where the monsters are people and not prosthetic stuntmen; and where people truly live Happily Ever After.
0375842209|5.0|This book is challenging without question.  It challenges the mind and heart.  It is told from the point of view of Death.  Death appears to struggle with the necessity of being objective when dealing with Liesel; she has strength and sweetness that is rarely seen in life or fiction.  She seems to charm Death.  This story is about relationships and how complicated they can be.  It is written very well and should not be rushed.  It takes time to absorb all of its nuances.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Ok. Thing with this album is, in order to like this album, you have to be a fan of AVENGED SEVENFOLD, or a new listener. Not particularly a fan of Waking the Fallen, or City of Evil, or...eh, Warmness and Sounding something or other. This album is NOT like the others, but no one should be surprised, because thats exactly what the band said before it came out.  This album is awesome. There are songs that will make you raise an eyebrow(if you're one of those people who can) but as you really listen to them, you FEEL it. Gunslinger, for example, is mindblowing to me, but when it started I was thinking...'what the..?'. A Little Piece of Heaven, is the craziest, and longest. If you watch the MVI, The Rev wrote it, and he and Shadows went crazy singing it, so you can only imagine. Brompton Cocktail, could be my favorite, or Scream, or Gunslinger, which has the deepest lyrics, I think. Which is another good thing to this CD. The lyrics.   All in all, if you're one of those people expecting another City of Evil, Waking the Fallen, or Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, you wont get it. This still has the Avenged Sevenfold feel, just with a different sound. So try it. I never spend my sad little amounts of money on music that isnt top notch.
0375836675|5.0|I read this book to see if it was something my middle school son would enjoy.  It is an amazing book; however some of the adult themes might make some young people uncomfortable.  This book is more edgy than most young adult fiction and is written in a very sophisticated way.  Although it is definitely unrealistic, it does deal with very real and tough issues.  I liked it well enough that I checked out the audio book at the library and listened to it as well.  The reader does a great job with that as well.
0761129235|4.0|Most of us are familiar with goal setting.  We have goals, either to loose weight, do the the taxes, look for a new job... and our usual method in doing so is to dedicate ambitious amounts of time and effort to reach the finish line as rapidly as possible.  However, if you're like me the sheer immensity of the task oftens leads to procrastination.  The bigger the goal, the more likely I'm to put it off.  This is where kaizen comes in.  Rather than trying to get everything done in one big step, kaizen teaches us to break it up into little chunks, that way the jobs don't seem quite as unapproachable.  Granted, results might seem slow at first when all you're doing is 3 push-ups a day for 2 weeks, however, this momentum gradually builds and within several months you'll easily wade into an exercise routine.     The book is easy to read and short.  The author starts off explaining what kaizen is and why it's effective.  He then devotes subsequent chapters applying the concepts for everyday situations.  He gives plenty of examples and minimize on fluff.  Overall a worthwhile read.
0440238609|2.0|I am so annoyed. What are these book companies thinking? The print is way to small. How can anyone read these tiny print books? Is the book business so bad that they have to print smaller to save a few pages? How much can a page and a little extra ink cost? Twenty cents? I don't buy any books that are tiny print and returned them as soon as I opened it.    Note to publishers: We'd buy a lot more books and read a lot more if we could actually read the words. 90% of all books are tiny type and I'm just not buying books or even attempting to read them when they're so tiny. I squinted through a few Agatha Christies but I can't take it anymore. My eyes hurt from squiting and I'm a young person too!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is THE definitive collection for any Alien fan. It has all four movies as well as an alternate version of each film. It is also packed with tons of extras like documentaries, interviews, pre and post production behind the scenes stuff. However, with most movies, the theatrical version is usually the better one. This is NOT the case with the second and third films. ALIENS is my favorite of the saga( and just about everyone else's), and the extra footage makes it that much better. The third movie just couldn't come close to the first two, but the alternate version does make it a little better. I agree with Ridley Scott, the director of the first alien. The theatrical version is the best version. The extra scenes just don't fit in well and are off timed with the rest of the movie. I enjoyed the forth movie and either version is just as good. These movies have been the inspiration for many other sci-fi movies and games, just look at Pitch Black and Halo. A great box set for any sci-fi fan.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|Incredible set at an unbeatable price, this is a \\"must-have\\" for fans of cinema in general, and fans of great science fiction in particular. Amazing picture quality across the board, it's hard to believe I saw this in the theater for the first time over 25 years ago. WB has set the bar for a premium quality box set release, and it was worth the wait.
B00006I53S|4.0|I have had this lense for a month now.  It has worked out great in just about every situation that I have used it in.  I was amazed how well it took pictures on IS even when I was at the end of zoom range and using the stock flash.  The wedding I used it for work great except for two things.  The 28mm did not give me a wide enough angle that I was hoping for.  Also, the only issue I have encountered is it has a problem focusing during low light conditions.  I have not had a chance to contact Canon or see if I can reproduce it, so this may have been isolated incident.  Otherwise I would definitly buy this lense again.

0618680004|4.0|God's existence is a scientific hypothesis, testable by evidence.  That is the theme of the first and most salient half of this book.<br /><br />Atheists can readily identify many types of evidence that, if extant, they would accept as proving God.  Jesus's return to earth is an obvious example.  Or God himself might once again walk the earth \\"in the cool of the day\\", as in Genesis 3:8.<br /><br />Evolutionists will readily identify evidence they would accept as disproving natural selection. \\"A rabbit fossil in a pre-Cambrian structure\\" was Haldane's famous example.<br /><br />Turning the question around, What evidence would theists accept as disproving God?  If any theist has ever identified any, Dawkins, and I, have not yet heard of it.<br /><br />But you can't prove a negative, Christians will argue.  Well, every Christian embraces--on peril of his soul--the negative conviction that the gods of two billion Muslims and Hindus are not real.  Where is their proof of this negative?<br /><br />That's the trouble with almost every theist argument.  Like an ant on a raft, it dodges around the evidence. The main theist argument is the \\"God of the gaps\\"--\\"you can't explain X [the origin of the universe, the origin of life, the complexity of life, etc.], so it must be God.\\" This is akin to prehistoric man concluding that thunder and lightning, unexplainable by him, must be supernatural. It is pure dodge.<br /><br />Dawkins does not claim that the atheist view is unassailable.  He DOES claim that the weight of the evidence is strongly on the athiest side.<br /><br />The evidence consists mainly of the wondrous complexity of life.  Which is the more probable explanation, creation or natural selection?<br /><br />Life is so intricate, so complex, so finely adapted to its environments, that the idea of a sudden, all-at-once creation is massively improbable.  Natural selection, by contrast, proceeds by billions of tiny changes, and in this way climbs what Dawkins calls \\"the hill of improbability\\".<br /><br />Beleivers cite that same complexity as evidence of God. But, Dawkins replies, a God capable of creating so complex a universe would Himself need to be even more complex, hence even more improbable, than His own creation.<br /><br />There just HAD to be a First Cause?  Then by the same argument God Himself must have had a cause.  To say \\"He just alway was\\" is to pose a mystery far greater than any of the mysteries He is supposed to answer. It is also, to Dawkins, intellectual surrender.<br /><br />Dawkins is fierce in assaulting the claim that God is \\"beyond science\\" or that religion and science inhabit \\"non-overlapping magisteria\\", as Stephen Jay Gould expressed it.  If you believe in the Abrahamic God of Judaism, Christianism, and Mohammedism, you believe in a Being that created Earth and superintends it still, that hears prayers, does miracles, inflicts punishments, and bestows rewards.  This Being operates in the same physical universe as science.<br /><br />But His followers resist, and contradict, science. Science consists of a roiling collection of theories and hypotheses.  Its driving force is skepticism.  Conventional religion denounces skepticism.  The very definition of \\"faith\\" is \\"abnegation of evidence.\\"<br /><br />The second half of the book swims out into the swamp of whether, on balance, religion is a good or bad thing.  Dawkins is best when he sticks to objective science.<br /><br />Dawkins proffers some Darwinian explanations of the religious impulse.  Still, he can't suppress wonderment that rational humans continue to be duped by religious superstition.  Probably all that can be said for now is that reason and religion operate in different parts of the brain.  Human thought and emotion are on the frontier of neurobiology.  We do know that the intuitive, emotional functions are at least as powerful as, and probably more powerful than, the purely logical functions.  Maybe that begins to explain how, for so many, faithtrumps science.
B000OY8NII|2.0|THis series is quite good, and if you want to know about that, read one of the other reviews. This review is to warn you all about the packaging used on this set. It does not take long until the manufactured biodegradable packaging will not hold disks. all 3 disks from this set frequently fall out. this leads to disk damage and irritation. It's great that they are attempting to be environmentally friendly, but the execution leaves something to be desired.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! When I first heard about it I thought it might be dumb. But then people started talking about it and saying how good it was, so I looked it up and saw that there were some not very good scenes in it. So I was skeptical but decided to try it. And it's awesome! It goes at a very nice pace, not too fast so you don't know what's happening, and not too slow so you get bored. The bad scenes are really not too bad. It's just an overall great movie. I think it would appeal to a broad range of audience who is of course into the war theme. The visual effects were spectacular. I couldn't believe it was done all on green screen. It's a very captivating movie and many would enjoy it.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Seriously, don't miss out. Get into this show and you won't regret it. Mindblowing stuff!
B000002U82|5.0|I've read the reviews posted prior (even the long winded ones...lol) and will tell you they are 150% correct. I'll keep it short and sweet. Buy this album. If you want a new experience, buy this album. If you never heard Pink Floyd before and are interested in hearing them, buy this album. If you are a fan of Rock n' Roll, buy this album. If you like music of any sort and any type, buy this album. Jeez louise... if you have a pulse, buy this album.<br /><br />It is not just music, it is an experience - where it takes you and what you get out of it is entirely up to you. That's not hippie talk, it's just the reality. It is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Most important: If this is your first time hearing Pink Floyd and or Dark Side do it correctly. Make sure you have about 40 minutes of time to just sit back and listen, because I highly recommend your first exposure to the album is straight through the first track to the last. I would almost say it's imperative...but with all the 'real' things to worry about in life an album is low on the pole. But you get my point.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed. There's a reason it's sold about 50 million copies and spent 700+ weeks (almost 15 years) straight on the Billboard Top 100.<br /><br />Remember...Optimism is free. Happy 420.
B00005JPTI|5.0|In the beginning of the movie a woman scientist/doctor accomplishes a medical breakthrough. She is being interviewed, and saying to the world that they have found a cure for cancer.<br /><br />Immediately, we flash to New York City<br /> three years later, It is literally DEAD.<br /><br />Foilage has grown up all the buildings, and the skyscrapers stand empty. The roads are cracked with weeds growing high through thier cracked surfaces. Empty cars are left abandoned, and wild deer run amok, over the cars and down the streets of a silent city.It has a very eerie feel to it.<br /><br />Will Smith is the only man left alive.He was immune to the virus that wiped out civilization.His German Shepard also survived the infection.<br /><br />When the infection hit, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus had a 90% kill rate-That's 5.4 billion people dead.With less than a 1% immunity it left 12 million healthy people.( The other 580 million turned into the mutated creatures we see throughout the film0<br />These creatures killed and fed off of the rest of the survivors, until there was no one left except Robert Neville (Will Smith's character)<br /><br />The creatures I mentioned are nocturnal, and ten times as ugly and violent as the infected on \\"28 Days Later.\\"And<br />since they ARE nocturnal, Will Smith can only do his hunting, gathering, and other chores (errands, DVD store etc,) during the day.He also sends out a broadcast on all AM frequencies,pleading that if there are any other survivors, to please contact him. He waits everyday at the same place also,hoping against all hope.<br /><br />The thing that amazed me most about this movie, was the EMPTY New York. I read that they emptied BLOCKS of the city to do the movie, because green screen, they felt, would just not have been effective enough. It gave the movie a very creepy quality they could not have acheived with green screen alone.<br /><br />The scare factor too was good( If you like to be scared, and I do :)  )<br />When the infected chase him, for example, It KEEPS you jumping-THAT'S FOR SURE !!<br /><br />I won't say what happens because I don't want to ruin an excellent movie, but you will not be dissapointed. I am hoping that when this comes out on DVD, it has alternate endings, not that anything about this movie was BAD, but I would like to see it have gone in a different direction.<br /><br />There are many surprises, and you will want to talk about, and think about this movie long after it is over.<br />I can't WAIT for it to come out on DVD, It is a definite must own for any DVD collection.<br /><br />Oh, and by the way, it does NOT follow the book.And that is a good thing, in my opinion.<br /> I bought the book after I saw the movie, and the two are NOTHING alike.Being that the book was written in the 1950's, the creatures were \\"vampires.\\"- which they are NOT in the movie. Back then writers didn't have the imagination they do now. There were werewolves and vampires. period.<br /><br />I like how they modernized the story for the 2000's.<br />Come to think about it, they WERE sort of like vampires. They came out at night,and feasted on blood (killing)...so I guess it depends what a \\"vampire\\" is, by what the writers IDEA of one is. hmmmmmmmmmm.mping-THAT'S FOR SURE !!

B000VWYJ86|4.0|...everyone has already touched on the good points, however, I do want to know what the director was thinking with the use of the camera during fight scenes as well as some rather dark scenes.  Kind of lost me there... but other then that.  A good flick and overall GREAT series.
031286504X|5.0|Maybe too late for most reading this review, but I would recommend reading the book before seeing the movie. The ending in the book is far more rewarding in my opinion. The movie could have been better if it held to more of the essence of the book I think. You should also know that \\"I Am Legend\\" is a novella and only constitutes about half of this book, the rest being other short stories. (\\"Witch War\\" one of the more twisted of these, with the Voodoo doll story from the 70's camp classic \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" being another)<br /><br />In any case, I read alot of apocalyptic/end of world stuff, and this is a must read for anyone into that kind of thing if for nothing else than a historical perspective on the evolution of the genre. I thought it was well written and ahead of its time. Its a little dated as you would expect, such as Robert's seeming devotion to keeping himself healthy by flossing and brushing... while chain smoking the whole time. :-)<br /><br />This book is worth the money I think, as long as the reader goes in expecting a vampire/zombie novel written in the contextual background of the 50's. It makes a statement about society and what constitutes 'normal', and once again should be considered a 'classic' of the end-of-world/plague genre.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I'm not going to bother reviewing the film. Its awesome. Its awesome having all five versions in the same box together.<br /><br />What's **more** awesome is the documentary, \\"Dangerous Days\\". Its extremely detailed, exhaustively researched and (amazingly!) never boring. Topping out at nearly four hours, I actually managed to get through it in one sitting. This is compelling stuff.<br /><br />The doc is not one of those \\"HBO Sneek Peek\\" affairs where everyone is compelled to heap praise on one another. While there may be a few punches pulled, you'll still notice actors or gaffers or writers or producers damning each other with faint praise. And Harrison Ford swears. Alot!<br /><br />What's more, other rising stars in the world of cinema weigh in on the impact of Blade Runner in their world. Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption), Ronald Moore (BSG, Star Trek), Guillermo Del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, Devil's Backbone) and more show up to pontificate poetically on what Blade Runner meant to them.<br /><br />\\"Dangerous Days\\" leaves no stone left unturned. Its honest and straightforward. I left it feeling much more informed about the creative process than in other docs such as \\"Hearts of Darkness\\".<br /><br />If you are a Blade Runner fanatic, I think your choice is made. Now you just gotta figure out whether or not the plastic case and the \\"Spinner\\" replica is worth another 30-40 bucks.<br /><br />NOTE - \\"Dangerous Days\\" is not in HD, j ustregular old 480P. This applies to both the BluRay and HDDVD versions.
0385338902|4.0|The main character in this book is quite tragic yet his antics are amusing, despite the topic of loss.  In true Tropper form there is an abundance of wit and sarcasm and a lead male that seems trapped in perpetual adolescence.  Tropper reads like a great conversation and always makes me laugh.  This was not his best work, but a fast read and throughly enjoyable, nonetheless.
1401300529|3.0|As a retired AF Office and history bluff  I enjoyed the book,however, I did not think it was a good as most reviews.    In many areas I felt he gave more detail than I felt necessary (domestic considerations) while in other areas there seemed to be a lack of detail that I felt would have have help carry the story (Chosin Reservoir escape and air operation in the escape and any air operations flown by Soviet pilots).  Most of all I disliked the little information about Air Force and Naval actions which played a very important role in the war. In reading one would think that the Navy and Air Force were just bit players in the war. I would like to have seen him at least acknowledge the role of the Naval Officer Eugene Clark and two Korean officers for their success in landing on island in Inchon Harbor several weeks before actual landing and being able to determine several defense factors critical to the landing success and to their taking a working lighthouse on night of landing and being able to guide landing craft safely into harbor.  There are several incorrect statements, while not major, did distract.  One is he writes about the B-17's being on ground and destroyed during the initial attack on Wake Island --It should have been Clark Field.  There were no B-17's on Wake and Wake did not have serious atack until several days after Pearl Harbor.   Through out the book he uses the term \\"Congressional Medal of Honor\\", there is in fact no such medal. Only one time in book did he use the correct, pure an simple, name of the award-- \\"Medal of Honor\\". I realize this is a comon mistake; however, with his sources and background it is a mistake he should have not made. He also states in several places a medals being given.   Medals are earned and awarded not given.
3822817015|5.0|They adorned American calendars, magazines, and paperbacks: playful on water skis, glamorous in evening gowns, seductive before their bedroom mirrors, each one presented in luscious, candy-coated colors to beguile the sensibilities of the businessman, the mechanic, the G.I., the clerk.  They were \\"Pin-Ups,\\" artists' near-fantasy renderings of femininity designed to catch and hold the attention of the American male.  They were also, unfortunately, disposable--disappearing into the trash when the calendar was out of date, the latest magazine edition released, the book cover worn to tatters.<br /><br />Fortunately, however, Charles G. Martignette and Louis K. Meisel have gathered together a wide array of these paintings and reproduced them in THE GREAT AMERICAN PIN-UP, a collection drawn from Martignette's own personal collection.  And from 1920 to 1980, from Vaughan Alden Bass to Ted Withers, this book offers 447 pages crowded with full page, half page, quarter page, and inset reproductions of the best of the best.<br /><br />The book opens with a series of essays on the subject--essays which are offered in English, French, and German translations and which cover the social trends and historical events that gave rise to the genre.  The entries are listed by artist and ordered alphabetically, each artist receiving at least a small note and some, such as the legendary Vargas, considerably more.  But this is all extra stuff: then as now, the real attraction is the art itself, and it is all beautifully reproduced in the full brilliance of original color.<br /><br />Whether the portraits are bathing beauty cheesecake, sultry glamor, or ill-concealed nudity beneath transparent robes, what most marks the classic pin-up is a sense of playful innocence, and that comes shining through in this truly entertaining, colorful, and often beautiful book.  If you are looking for a glimpse of the art, here it is--in all it's radiant and sometimes naughty glory.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B0007VZ9DK|4.0|Although i considered Casino a very good movie, it had its flaws and definately is one of Martin Scorcese's lesser films from that which he has produced in the past. This coming from a big Scorcese fan mind you :D.<br /><br />Performance wise the film is flawless Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci deliver the goods as always and drive the film into depth so much more than if someone else were to play the parts. Also Sharron Stone delivers a rare great performance through the directing of Martin scorcese.<br /><br />Based upon The crumbling of the mobs casino organisation, this movie dwelves into the day by day events that occur within the casino. All the misfits, scammers and what happens to those caught ripping off from the mobs money.<br />When things start to go wrong robert deniro, joe pesci and sharron stone's characters start to create conflict amongst one another and things only become worse as the mobster world begins to crumble.<br /><br />The film has a great story and great visuals, the only problem i found within the film was i was a little thrown off by the constant voice over dialogue. In some scenes it is horribly misplaced and in some others it has been used in ways which were unneccesary and could have been told through the visual storytelling.<br /><br />None the less Casino is a good film and i suggest that you should certainly watch it especially if you are a scorcese fan =).
B000WZAE1I|5.0|When I first saw this trailer for Stardust I thought to myself (because thinking out loud is just silly), It might be an alright movie.  I was going to see it when it came out but never got a chance to.  I just wanted to see my hero DeNiro playing in this kind of role.  When I saw this DVD sitting on the shelf of the video rental place I thought, \\"Oh yeah, I wanted to see this.\\"  I rented it with a few other films and watched them first, in no real hurry to pop this in the DVD player, boy was I mistaken.<br /><br />This film is about exciting and fun as a fantasy adventure can be.  The fantasy genre is strong again with recent films like Harry Potter, LOTR, 300, Beowulf, Narnia, the Golden compass road to Teribitha and Pan's Labyrinth.  The almost anemic fantasy genre in the '90 is back and stronger than ever.  People are getting really jazzed for these films.  This one is more than a solid film; I'll put this film up against any of last year.  Stardust features great acting buy the likes of Michele Pfeiffer (who is still hot as hell) Robert DeNiro, small little roles by Ricky Gerves and acting legend Peter O'Tool.<br /><br />The story is based on the books and graphic novels written by award winning writer Neil Gaiman (Mirrormask, Sandman) and drawn by comic book legend Charles Vess.  The screenplay was adapted perfectly by Mathew Vaughn and Jane Goldmen for the big screen and wonderfully directed by relative new comer Mathew Vaughn (Layer Cake).  The action is compelling and has a spark of originality to it. Great character development with lots of simultaneous storylines going on, it ran the risk of being concussing, but it was written and directed so flawlessly that it added another dimension of enjoyment to every character and every part of the film.  You wanted to see where each character was going to end up.<br /><br />So what kind of movie is this?  Pure fair tale fantasy. Who is it for?  Everyone!  This is written for adults but everyone can enjoy this one. The characters make this film lively,  Michele Pfeiffer plays a witch obsessed with youth, Robert DeNiro plays a lightning catching, gay, cross dressing pirate/ hair dresser (insert joke here) there is a 95 year old guard that guards the entrance into this fantasy world who performs martial arts like Jet Li, and lastly a shooting star played by Claire Danes.<br /><br />Lots of magic and imagination to the story that fits into the world that the creators of them film immerse the viewer in.  This film has a ton of heart it's fair share of laughs too.  This is the Princess Bride meets Midnight Run meets the Fifth Element.  I'm not sure what others think of this film because I try to refrain from reading reviews before I write mine, but I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by a film that you can enjoy with your family and still be entertaining in everyway.  If you're a fan of these types of movies go out and buy this one.  If you're a fan of the Princess Bride, Willow or Gaiman's other work, you'll without a doubt love this.this film lively,  Michele Pfeiffer plays a witch obsessed with youth, Robert DeNiro plays a lightning catching, gay, cross dressing pirate/ hair dresser (insert joke here) there is a 95 year old guard that guards the entrance into this fantasy world who performs martial arts like Jet Li, and lastly a shooting star played by Claire Danes.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|Looking for yet another Rom-com to cheer you up, where you know exactly how it will end...? Apply elsewhere!  This is a movie that takes its good time in getting to the feel-good part, but does so with such a compellingly dysfunctional family of characters that you'll feel enriched for staying on board to the end.  The stalls are set out from the get go, when we meet each of the principal characters of the family, as different as could be.  When the young daughter has a chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant (scary that such events exist), they all up and leave en masse in the yellow VW minivan for a memorable road trip.  The worldly and outspoken grandpa, the suicidal brother, the relatively normal mother trying to keep the family on track, the father obsessed with success but unable to grasp it himself, the rebelling teenager in a vow of silence.. all are thrown into close proximity for the journey to California.  Add a seriously temperamental VW minibus, and the stage is set for some soul searching, reality checks, pathos and humor.  As a comedy, this is certainly no exercise in hilarity or slapstick.... but it will leave you smiling, and it WILL leave you talking about it after the DVD is back in the case.. what better compliment could there be.
B000GG4XJM|5.0|This is folk music, but few reviewers have noted how the music of the African American creeps into this album and also into the excellent Dublin Live album (though I thought the BBC show in the church was better).  American folk music was the medium of the poor white man, originally of Irish, Scottish or English origin (please don't say British - there is no such thing as British culture; neither does anybody speak with a British accent!).  These were the guys of the slave states, the rebels and, after 1865 the white trash, but however much they despised the African Americans they absorbed their music and this cultural fusion of the slaves and the rednecks gave us rock 'n' roll, the favourite medium of the Boss. The black influence on this album is evident both in the brass section and in the choice of some of the material.  Though still a 'folk' album one senses how rock developed from the songs on this album, which certainly 'rock' in their own way.  It is wonderful, beautiful, evocative music truly 'Born in the USA'.  Some tracks don't work so well but genius is always flawed; it's never pure.  What on earth do you expect?  But forget the anthropology and enjoy the music.  (I certainly did laugh the other night when I heard James Stewart singing 'Buffalo Girls' in 'It's a Wonderful Life' (and yes, we were all in tears at the end.  If it doesn't make you cry I figure this Springsteen album should at least make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.  If not you are such a party who is only moved by an earthquake)).
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Outstanding!!   I watched this movie in a flight not knowing anything about it. From the moment it started till it ended, it had me completely engaged. I watched the movie again just for the music and the mood.    This soundtrack is one of the purest, heartfelt albums released this year. I am in love with Markéta Irglová's voice. \\"If you want me\\" showcases the beauty in her voice. Glen Hansard puts his heart and soul in his singing. Listen to \\"When Your Minds Made Up\\" and you will know what I mean. Every song is fantastic. A MUST BUY
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|This movie was so amazing. Easy to watch,   infinitely entertaining. It never got boring  or slow, and it threw in some laughs. I had  a great time watching this movie.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Like most folks, I had very high hopes for this film, definitely after the loosely connected 3-movie story arc preceeding it.  This movie didn't have the punch nor leave the audience with the typical satisfactory feeling afterwards.  I despised the use of an otherwise talented and beloved supporting cast for comical relief.  Instead of allowing the secondary characters a real chance to run, it resorted to sight gags and pretty much made them look like buffoons, and Shatner clearly didn't rectify the more-embarrassing moments.  However, that being said, the film show several wonderful moments..:    1) LOVED the campfire scenes both at the beginning and end, effectively bracketing the film's story in a poignant way.  Why couldn't you have had moments like these for the secondary characters??? ~ They are seasoned ACTORS for heaven's sake..!  After how many movies and episodes, not only are they relegated to remain as secondaries, but treated with even less respectful screentime. Again, warm moments you WISHED they did more on the big screen ~ Taking time out to EXPLORE these characters and what makes them tick together, after all these voyages.  Without families, who have they really become..?    2) Loved the horseback and wilderness scene's overall.  Gave the normally 'sterile' starship crew a more beneficial and agreeable backdrop to work against.     3) Despite the lack of good effects, the Kirk/Spock interplay at the end was excellent ('Spock, not in front of the Klingons...').  It helps to make up for the heavy-handed 'I-need-my-pain' message you had to slog through.    The Sybok character was entirely miscast and misdirected..  Who would believe he would be a Vulcan, even Spock's half-brother, raised by Surak...?  Terribly chemistry between him and the stars.  Granted he was no Khan, but a more cerebral and reserved, less jovial approach would have made for better and conflict with depth.  Instead we're treated to some painfully embarrassing exchanges.    All inall, some excellent, warm screen moments found nowhere else in this franchise, but try not to wear out your fast-forward button.
B00001U0DP|2.0|I would not recommend this movie. Not homogeneous. Beginning and end belong to two different movies. Ok, the last scene was touching and some of the scenes were quite engaging but overall I did not enjoy it that much.

B000002P5W|5.0|Axis: Bold As Love (1968) was the second album from The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and is essential to any Hendrix collection. It includes the classics, If 6 Was 9, Little Wing, Spanish Castle Magic, and Castles Made Of Sand which are all fantastic songs, and some of Jimi's very best work. They are interesting and intense, with Hendrix-class guitar work on all of them. Bold As Love, One Rainy Wish, and Up From the Skies are good, too. The overall sound of the album is psychedelic, but also mellow and jazzy if compared to his other two official studio releases. It's really a matter of taste as to which of Jimi's albums is the best, and Axis: Bold As Love will be the choice of those who like the psychedelic and more cerebral sound of the album. If 6 Was 9 is the album's centerpiece, and is Jimi's freak flag flying anthem of nonconformist individuality.<br /><br />I'm the one that's gonna die<br />When it's time for me to die<br />So let me live my life the way I want to<br />Yeah, sing on brother, play on drummer

0446677450|1.0|Kiyosaki writes about becoming rich, claiming to have been bankrupt (of which there is no record) at almost 40 years of age and 9 years later a retired millionaire investor. He claims to have had a \\"rich dad\\" financial adviser father-figure in his life (which he admitted was as real as \\"Harry Potter\\") that taught him how to make money. If \\"Rich Dad\\" taught him how to be a successful business owner, why was he living out of his car, bankrupt, at 40? A college graduate and US Marine helicopter pilot. Does that make sense?<br /><br />He goes on to admit starting several businesses that failed, of which he gave somewhat accurate descriptions. However, in his self-accolades he is vague at best in describing his own business ventures, only saying he invests in real estate and corporations (of which there are no verifiable records on file with his state or any that has been researched).<br /><br />Kiyosaki also gives blatantly illegal advice recommending insider trading, tax fraud (claiming illegitimate business expenses on tax returns) and had reportedly given illegal investing advice in seminars as well. I'm guessing his customers wanted to be wealthy in their mansions, not a 10x10 cell.<br /><br />If you decide to read this book, take from it Kiyosaki's idea that you should buy assets and not liabilities. Don't get into credit card debt. Learn how to invest your money.... Just not from him! Really, why would you need to read the book? I've just given you the only sound advice offered in the whole thing.<br /><br />And from the younger crowd (I'm still under 30, thank you) don't quit your job or drop-out of college just yet. I'm a successful business owner without a college degree and I would never say they're not worth it. I dropped out to start an internet business in 1999 as the dot-com bust was just happening. I still wish I'd finished school, even though I'm successful and making well over the mean income of those with post-graduate and professional degrees. Some things you can only learn with experience, but for everything else there's school.<br /><br />Finally, the book is all self-motivation. That's not a bad thing, but it gives no practical advice so it leaves you hungry for riches and eager to start, but only gives snippets of awful (and illegal) advice and repetition of the same old story again and again. If you need this much motivation to make a change in your life, you need to get a wake up call. A book ain't gonna do it for you... suck it up and realize that the road to change starts with one step. You don't need Kiyosaki, or anyone, to tell you that. Stop reading about it and take a step towards it, either by paying off your debt or dabbling in investing.<br /><br />But please if you decide to invest in real estate or start a business, consult a real expert or professional for advice... don't rely on any from this book.<br /><br />And just to pound it home, make sure you at least skim the required reading before making the purchase:<br />[...]ings you can only learn with experience, but for everything else there's school.<br /><br />Finally, the book is all self-motivation.

B000I5YCCO|5.0|I completely hate country music, but absolutely love Taylor Swift and can't get enough. She is a stroke of brilliant and her music is very addicting and catchy. I have suggested this CD to everybody I know because it is that incredible. I don't even mind the banjo's......
B000Y179KO|5.0|After my first run through both discs I was a bit disappointed. The album lacks some of the edge I was expecting (my fault, not theirs). There are no real highs and lows. But now that I've listened to it dozens of times and learned the lyrics, I really enjoy it. It's got a feeling of honestly which connects with your soul. The Eagles have shown you there best work here. The songs reflect the age and maturity of the group. I expect it's there last work together as they end the album with \\"It's Your World Now\\".
0618680004|5.0|as other reviews have said, it raises good points that make you think and good issues to wield when confronted about your beliefs (i BELIEVE in atomic theory as well, so don't take that word the wrong way). a worthwhile book to get, no matter who you are. it taught me several things i'd not thought of.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|1st of all, this is my 1st time watching this movie. I was 2 years old when the movie was released and... throughout life... i've heard about this movie but... never had the chance to watch it.       While watching this movie, i tried to keep in mind that this movie was made in 82...     Movie: For the most part, the movie was really good. F*&king weird at the end... but it was pretty good. And i'm sure it was a great movie back in the days. but... i watched it with an open mind and i found that the movie was worth the buy.     Video: Man, i was totally amazed by the video quality of this movie. I've always thought that some of the movies remade on blu-ray didn't look as good because it was such an old film but i was proved wrong by this movie. It's definately a 5.        Audio: Holy Moly. I truly-truly, enjoyed the sound quality of this movie. I felt like my surround sound was truly being used throughout the movie and that it was being used well. The movie has alot of flying cars flying around you and you can really feel it because of the surround sound makes sure of it!    Extras: I put N/A because i haven't looked into it as much and i feel like i wont have the opportunity anytime soon. All i know is that there are 4 extra disk.    All in all, i'm guessing this flick was ahead of its time in 1982...  and watching it now wasn't so bad either.. and the blu-ray version is amazingly awesome.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|A cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions, Mel Gibson's Braveheart easily competes with the classic historical epics of cinema including Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as well as recent blockbusters such as Gladiator. It is a film that encompasses all of the finest methods of filmmaking, and never fails to present a passionate and powerful story above its other movie-making feats. Awe-inspiring, brutal and action-packed, Braveheart makes no mistakes in its storytelling process and includes some of the most memorable and adrenaline-rushing sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />In 1280 Scotland, young William Wallace learns the hardships of life as reining King Edward the Longshanks claims the Scottish throne for himself and lays down a strict and merciless rule. When a group of noblemen go to negotiate with the local lords, they are slaughtered by order of the king, and William's father dies in the ensuing fight. Wallace (Mel Gibson) leaves for a time to study in neighboring countries and to gain skills in fighting, even though he hopes to come home to raise a family and crops. Upon his return, he secretly marries his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack); secrecy is needed due to the king's reinstatement of Prima Nocta, a law that allows the lord of the land to spend the first night with every newlywed bride. When Murron is attacked by English soldiers, Wallace assaults them, which leads to his wife being slain by the governing magistrate. In a fit of rage and revenge, he overthrows the English soldiers in his village, kills the magistrate, and begins gathering troops to take back control of Scotland.<br /><br />It comes as a shock to me that Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of William Wallace, which is a fantastic role, adding elements of Mad Max and Martin Riggs peeking through the believable Scottish accent. All of the roles are well developed and enjoyable, from the miserly King Edward to madman Stephen to Angus Macfadyen's Robert the Bruce. Powerful performances all around boost the epic feel and thrilling action in this historical tale of bravery and courage.<br /><br />The scene following Murron's early death is perhaps the finest of the film, showing such passion, excitement and white-knuckle thrills like few films of our time. Filmed nearly all in slow motion, with powerful glances and violent bravado, Wallace takes his revenge on the English lord and begins the campaign to free Scotland from England's tyranny.

Powerful performances all around boost the epic feel and thrilling action in this historical tale of bravery and courage.    The scene following Murron's early death is perhaps the finest of the film, showing such passion, excitement and white-knuckle thrills like few films of our time. Filmed nearly all in slow motion, with powerful glances and violent bravado, Wallace takes his revenge on the English lord and begins the campaign to free Scotland from England's tyranny.

0393061310|5.0|2005 Vintage reprint of 1st edition (1997), 480 pages.    This is another of the twenty books Charlie Munger recommends in the second edition of Poor Charlie's Almanack (the most useful book I have read) along with Diamond's first book, The Third Chimpanzee.     The Third Chimpanzee is the story of how humans became 'different' to other animals and what the future might hold for us, as evidenced by our recent past. It contains a section on why some peoples and societies came to dominate others. Guns, Germs and Steel is that section made into a book.    I found this detracted from my interest somewhat, as I was already aware of Diamond's broad conclusions and why he had reached them before starting the book (conversely, I found that section of The Third Chimpanzee very interesting). I have no regrets, though. Reading the books in the order they were published allows us to understand Diamond's thoughts and research better, as we get to follow his progress.     I talked in my earlier review of The Third Chimpanzee about the dangers of man-with-a-hammer syndrome (those who focus only on a narrow discipline are likely to interpret all findings through a single, distorted lens - just as a man equipped only with a hammer tends to see everything as a nail). Jared Diamond is an exemplar of the opposite: he started off in medical research, then pursued a parallel second career in bird ecology, evolution and biogeography and is (or was) learning his twelfth language. I greatly admire the way he synthesizes huge amounts of data across several disciplines to arrive at his striking conclusions.    Guns, Germs and Steel - as with another book on Munger's list of twenty recommended books, Garrett Hardin's Living Within Limits - is both a terrific book on its specific subject but also provides a superb broader example of how to think critically.     A couple of examples might help to illustrate what I mean. The first is a theme of both of Diamond's first two books: searching alwaysfor the ultimate rather than the proximate explanation. Eurasian technology, germs and societal structure were key factors that allowed Eurasian societies to dominate the others. However, Diamond asserts that underlying these proximate factors were the ultimate factors of the plant and animal species available for domestication and the general geography.     The availability of far better plant and animal species allowed farming and animal husbandry to take hold much earlier in Eurasia. This allowed much higher population densities - both of humans and their domesticated animals. This in turn led to a larger incidence of powerful human epidemic diseases - which in a number of cases originated from the domesticated animals. The more efficient food production and higher population densities in their turn allowed for specialisation, as societal classes could exist whose practitioners did not have to provide their own food (including professional soldiers).     Thus, the ultimate factors determine the existence of the proximate factors. Most people never see beyond the proximate factors - which appear to explain the outcomes, but in fact do not. This is an extremely important lesson.     Charlie Munger's mental models, for example, can be best viewed as an attempt to distil the way the world works to the simplest underlying (ultimate) reasons. This approach carries two massive benefits: if ultimate explanations exist we cannot understand how the world works (become 'wise') without knowing what they are (or even knowing that we should be searching for them). And secondly, it is much easier to remember and make use of fewer, simpler underlying factors.    Once you begin looking for ultimate factors, you begin to see them everywhere. The search for underlying reasons is usually explicit (or at least implicit) in all of the really good books. Karen Pryor shows this clearly in `Don't Shoot the Dog' (one of my favourite books that I have just re-read):    \\"These principles [of training with reinforcement] are laws, like the laws of physics. They underlie all learning-teaching situations as surely as the law of gravity underlies the falling of an apple. Whenever we attempt to change behaviour, in ourselves or others, we are using these laws, whether we know it or not.\\"    The second excellent example of an approach to problem solving from Diamond is one of Charlie Munger's favourites. Diamond calls it the Anna Karenina principle, after the first sentence in Tolstoy's novel:    \\"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\\"    Diamond explains what Tolstoy means: in order for a marriage to be a success, it must succeed in many different respects. The failure of any one of, for example, sexual attraction, agreement about money, child discipline or religion can doom a marriage - no matter how positive all the other factors.    Diamond then uses this principle to show us why so few animals have been successfully domesticated (because every one of at least six significant factors must be present for a species to be a suitable candidate for human domestication):     \\"This principle can be extended to understanding much else about life besides marriage. We tend to seek easy, single-factor explanations of success. For most important things, though, success actually requires avoiding many separate possible causes of failure.\\"    This principle underlies the reasoning behind the Harvard School Commencement speech Charlie Munger gave in 1986 (included in Poor Charlie's Almanack). In it Munger inverts the problem of achieving a good and successful life by telling his audience how to virtually guarantee a miserable and unsuccessful life. By avoiding the key causes of failure, one is likely to end up with success by default: sometimes difficult problems are best solved (or even can only be solved) backwards.    As Sertillanges says: \\"What is knowledge, but the slow and gradual cure of our blindness?\\" I am grateful to Diamond (and Munger, who pointed me towards him) for helping me to see a little better.
B00005JPTI|3.0|While this is the fourth time the story for I Am Legend has been adapted for film (first as The Last Man on Earth, second as The Omega Man and third as I Am Omega), the script is unduly similar to countless other horror and sci-fi films of late. Lone survivor Neville faces the monotony of isolation (as seen in Cast Away) and grasps at the hope that he can discover a cure for the virus that has wiped out civilization (as seen in the equally mediocre Resident Evil). The constant \\"jump\\" scares become predictable and the stodgy creature designs are curiously reminiscent of The Mummy's Imhotep. I Am Legend is unfortunately one of those films that may be entertaining at first glance, but will be quickly forgotten.<br /><br />From the first few minutes of the film it is more than apparent that the last man on earth is not alone. And that's when the suspense hits. The most impressive and annoying aspect of I Am Legend is the wavering suspense turned to constant apprehension. It is not intellectual or psychological suspense like that found in Alfred Hitchcock's legendary works, but mere \\"jump scares\\" that create shock from the unexpected. Startling the audience with fulminating noises, sudden movements and creatures lashing out at the screen, this is clearly the poor man's replacement for genuine scares. The constant fright builds plenty of anticipation, but due to the regular intervals of scream-inducing moments, it becomes rather predictable as the movie progresses.<br /><br />A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, of which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary. The post virus break out is narrated through dream sequences and flashbacks to explain why Neville is alone in New York. While much of the deterioration of humans into vampiric zombies is not covered, the reverse effect, in which the creatures begin to grow smarter and appear to follow a leader, is completely untouched by explanation. In fact, the last we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.<br /><br />In an attempt to demonstrate Neville's loneliness as the last man on earth, he sets up mannequins in the neighboring video rental store to simulate interactivity with humans. It is a relatively successful demonstration of the mental instabilities he suffers due to extreme isolation, but even at its finest, when he finally confronts a female mannequin that he continually jokes with his dog about approaching, it feels like an inferior version of Cast Away. At the same time, a single shot of one of the mannequins seemingly turning its head as Neville passes by, is the highlight of the horror creepiness, which is perhaps the only real psychological scare.<br /><br />I Am Legend remains entertaining throughout (mostly due to Smith's onscreen charisma and the incessant jump scares) but ultimately offers nothing new to the genre. Straying far from the novel's more thought-provoking storyline, (involving multiple factions of human digression and vampire tendencies), this Legend never really breaches the sci-fi horror category and often feels all too familiar for those keeping up on their sci-fi/horror films. Superb action sequences help and poor creature designs certainly don't, but enough entertainment can be had that Smith's latest work is worth a look for those interested in the genre; just don't expect anything too legendary.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinslast we hear of Neville's experiments is that they have de-evolved into the most primitive of life forms - and the very next second they are plotting intricate traps and training zombie dogs to attack.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|Violent, thrilling, musical, and comedic, Tim Burton's latest gothic period piece is many things - and unoriginal is certainly not one of them. This eclectic blend of genres may not always produce the perfect results, but the utter bizarreness keeps the intrigue from wearing off before the killing begins.<br /><br />Based on the Broadway musical, Sweeney Todd follows the vicious cycle of revenge as Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) returns home to London to punish those that wronged him long ago. Assuming the alias of Sweeney Todd and setting up a barber shop over Mrs. Lovett's (Helena Bonham Carter) meat pie restaurant, the two enter into a heinous partnership that will allow Barker to exact his revenge.<br /><br />As bizarre as Sweeney Todd is, it works on quite a few levels. It is literally unlike anything committed to the big screen before, with its wide array of odd imagery and fiercely vibrant performances. The fact that it is a musical is its most inspiring aspect, considering the subject matter is unbelievably dark. To blend slashing throats with melodic tunes is a feat perhaps no one but Tim Burton could pull off. The heavy contrast of singing and bloody violence is utterly singular and many thanks go to Steven Sondheim for crafting such luscious music to go with the sinister plot. That stark contrast adds to the undeniably visceral imagery, which at times becomes so outrageous that you can't help but laugh or applaud.<br /><br />Those unfamiliar with Sweeney Todd's origins may be surprised to find that the majority of the film is sung. Rather than inserting musical numbers into the story, practically the whole plot is revealed through musical exchanges between the actors, and ominous lyrics foreshadow the visuals to come. Strangely, with so many songs throughout, very few carry a tune or melody that will stay with you after the credits roll. Much of the clever writing will evoke laughter at first listen, but even the more light-hearted songs rarely recall the catchy riffs of macabre musical relative The Rocky Horror Picture Show. While the tunes themselves may not be overly memorable, their delivery is, as several extremely talented actors showcase their singing abilities.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is the perfect match for portraying the scheming, vengeance-obsessed barber Sweeney Todd, with his brooding presence and sullen voice. His wild-haired accomplice Mrs. Lovett receives exquisite attention by Helena Bonham Carter and her musical numbers with Depp are easily the most impressive in the film. Sacha Baron Cohen turns in an enjoyably maniacal performance as Todd's barber rival and even the main antagonist portrayed by Alan Rickman joins in the singing. Young Ed Sanders as Toby steals his fair share of scenes as well, and the newcomer proves he can sing with the best of them.<br /><br />As one could expect from an R-rated Tim Burton thriller about a demonic barber, there is plenty of bloodshed. Straight razors are the primary tool of destruction and the blood flows freely once Todd begins his vengeful killing spree. In a manner reminiscent of Tarantino's Kill Bill, the violence is so excessively brutal that one quickly becomes desensitized to the carnage, and throat slashing montages can be appreciated for their morbid humor and the eventual cannibalistic endeavors they represent. Plenty of physical humor and darkly comedic imagery do find their way into Sweeney Todd, though the story at the heart of this tragic musical is so horrific that the overall mood of the film remains grim. Aside from an abundance of bleeding necks, the visuals are truly amazing. The foggy streets of London and the haunting menace of Mrs. Lovett's meat pie shop recall the eerily dark set designs of Sleepy Hollow, while the vibrant dream sequence leans toward Beetlejuice. Every character's costume also superbly matches their physique, from Lovett's gothic dresses to Pirelli's garish garb.<br /><br />Tim Burton loves the macabre, as well as bleak colors, and the film is so heavily desaturated that at times it appears black-and-white. At least until the red begins to flow. But this harsh color scheme does wonders for the makeup, locations and sets, for they all become more vividly alive - the performances stand out, as do the carefully planned expressions and lyrics, since color only interferes visually with characters such as Sacha Baron Cohen's flamboyant Pirelli. Additionally, the daydream sequences by Mrs. Lovett are wildly vibrant in comparison to the real world of ashen streets and neutral shadowy rooms.<br /><br />More visually stunning than musically memorable, Sweeney Todd nevertheless presents an epic and ghastly tale of love and revenge in a manner unlike any before it. Bloodthirsty to an extreme, but with entertainment to match, Burton's latest should not be missed for those with an appreciation of the daringly original.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinshat at times it appears black-and-white.

B0009MAO46|4.0|A good film, devoid the touching sadness its sequel had in certain parts, Toy Story is just a fun film to see, and its then landmark animation is still impressive today! Heck, any mainstream film with a guy named Woody in it is worth seeing just for that reason, right?
B00005JPNW|3.0|For all of its bells and whistles, of which it has many, The Golden Compass is still unable to surpass the status of a replication of one of the countless existing family-friendly fantasy films out there. Even with the astute devising of daemons and the heart-stirringly massive armored bears, it is essentially another version of \\"Narnia\\" or \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". It's solid entertainment, but of the repetitious kind - much like it's the sequel to something else, even though it is clearly the first of a series.<br /><br />Young Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) lives in an alternate world to earth - many of the locations and lands are similar to our planet, but certainly not to be mistaken for the same. The most noticeable difference, aside from the science fiction fantasy blend of technology, is that the souls of humans appear on the outside of their bodies, in the form of animals called Daemons, that faithfully accompany them. Lyra's ever-changing Daemon is known as Pantalaimon (voiced by Freddie Highmore).<br /><br />When Lyra hears about a forbidden magical particle called dust, beguiling scientist Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman) asks Lyra to join her on a journey to the north as an assistant. Lyra is eager for a chance to escape her schoolwork and follow after her uncle Lord Asrial (Daniel Craig), who is also journeying to the Arctic Circle to investigate a sighting of large quantities of dust. Shortly after her departure, Lyra discovers that Mrs. Coulter is working for the Magisterium, the strict government that rules over the land. Linking Coulter to the recent disappearance of her best friend, Lyra sets out to locate a villainous facility where kidnapped children are used for cruel experimentation. During her travels she is aided by a band of Gyptians, a Texas airship pilot (Sam Elliott), the mysterious witch Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green) and a giant armored ice bear named Iorek Byrnison (voiced by Ian McKellen) to carve out a path of freedom for the captured children. Along the way she also obtains an Alethiometer, a strange golden compass that tells the truth to those who know how to read (and sure enough she knows how to read it).<br /><br />There are quite a few innovative ideas at work in The Golden Compass, the first of Philip Pullman's \\"His Dark Materials\\" trilogy adaptations. Daemons, the souls that take the shape of animals are unique and well-developed and allow for much of the photorealistic computer graphics work. The fact that they speak and serve as a physical conscience is even more fascinating.<br /><br />Another aspect, which is certainly not as unique, is the Magisterium, the totalitarian government that controls the alternate world. They keep people in line by telling them what to do - something rebellious little Lyra has great difficulty accepting. The Catholic Church has been in an uproar ever since this project was announced, and has banned its viewing by members due to the Magisterium's loose resemblance to their religious hierarchy. The only way anyone could take offense to possible symbolism in a completely fictitious work is by assuming that such characters resemble them too closely. But the Magisterium is simply an Orwellian dictatorship as witnessed in countless other films. In the movie they are clearly villains - could it be that the church views itself as despotic antagonists?<br /><br />The armored bear is perhaps the finest accomplishment for the film, although at times he wanders dangerously close to unrealistic. But considering a giant talking bear is already unbelievable, The Golden Compass does a spectacular job of bringing him to life with nearly flawless movement and extraordinary muscle and fur interaction. Several of the daemons are less impressive, including Mrs. Coulter's golden monkey, which at times barely resembles an animal.<br /><br />Films like The Golden Compass usually have a difficult time with their introduction due to the difficulty of quickly defining an entirelyforeign world. They have to provide enough information to make you believe in the fantasy, without overloading you with complex jargon. Despite the ridiculous names that are impossible to keep track of, The Golden Compass does introduce its wonders quickly and relatively clearly so that most audiences won't be left with too many questions. Especially considering there are more films on the way, it's acceptable (although annoying) to keep a few secrets. I would, however, like to know where the ice bear stores his armor.<br /><br />- Mike Massieformation to make you believe in the fantasy, without overloading you with complex jargon.

B000UOOT1W|4.0|The love affair with Latin music in the United States and internationally has ebbed and flowed from the craze for Cuban Mambo in the 1940s and 50s to the widespread popularity of Latin tropical and pop acts today.    Santana, as a musician and arranger, is a pivotal figure in this history and he has been an ambassador to the world of Latin American musical culture. In the 1960s and 70s, Santana's pioneering guitar arrangements, rooted in the Latin American traditions that were flowering at the time (for a beautiful example of traditional Latin American guitar virtuosity, see: [[ASIN:B000W8FY7O Puerto Plata: Mujer de Cabaret]]), brought Latin music into the pop mainstream. Santana's fusion of typical Latin American rhythms with edgy US rock inspired generations and helped begin the Latin rock movement (inspiring the likes of legendary Manu Chao: [[ASIN:B000026I8U Clandestino]]).    Today Santana continues to work tirelessly to secure the place of Latin music in popular culture, collaborating with the likes of Jennifer Lopez and Steve Tyler (Aerosmith). Ironically (or perhaps mystically as Carlos would see it) while Santana in his youth broke with tradition by encouraging these musical fusions, his is now a voice of tradition within them.     This compilation of 18 masterful songs, some of them never before released, ranging from the beginning of Santana's career until today, is fitting and deserving tribute to an artist who has contributed so much to the world of music. As one would expect with a Santana release, the cover artwork provides plenty for the eye to contemplate as the ear listens.

Her lack of sexual morals was sad, her language was occasionally very foul, and her lack of respect for other's political views was hard to swallow.  On her way to \\"enlightenment\\" she failed to realize what love for humankind really is.  It is easy to love a friend, but harder to love a foe.  Loving a foe is a demonstration of true enlightenment. I felt that her political views frequently got in the way of me wanting to sympathize with her further.  I felt sad throughout the book that she had no central core of beliefs with which to support herself.  She was like a feather being tossed by every wind of \\"doctrine\\" the world could offer.  It made me wonder, does this happen to a lot of people?  How disstressing if true.  I could sympathize with some of her struggles to control her thoughts, but in the end I couldn't swallow her tactics of overcoming them.  Liz, try Midwest Center for Stress and Anxiety.

B000VNMMR0|4.0|Chuck Norris may be able to divide by zero and appoint presidents, but I've never known him to blow up a helicopter using a car simply because he was \\"out of bullets.\\" That's John McClane's job. In the grand tradition of its predecessors, Live Free Or Die Hard is an absurdly over-the-top action movie that knows it's an absurdly over-the-top action movie, that knows exactly what its audience wants (better than they do, as a matter of fact) and knows exactly how to deliver on it. I mean, what else do you expect from a movie whose trailer prepared audiences for a late June release by promising that \\"this summer, Independence Day comes early,\\" and then launching into a testosterone-soaked mini-montage set to Beethoven's 9th played on an electric guitar (okay, those might have been two different trailers. But you get the picture)? This is the stuff that Michael Bay's wet dreams are made of.    This movie is full of cool stuff- Justin Long is great as Matt Farrell, McClane's wisecracking sidekick de jour. He's an incredibly likeable fellow, even though most of his job consists of gawking in amazement every time Bruce blows something up. Suffice to say, he's got a lot of gawking to do. The plot is a snazzy update of the diabolical scheme behind Die Hard With A Vengeance (only with computers instead of bombs), and there's a nice little emotional hook involving McClane's daughter. Oh, and there's this one part where he punches a guy through a wall. That was cool.    So it's not without its flaws; as the main villain, Timothy Olyphant spends most of his time wandering around in a daze, as if trying to figure out how he wound up on a movie set and if there'll be a part for him (he does have his moments of icy bad guy creepiness, though). Plus, as the movie approaches its climax, the proceedings reach a level of ridiculousness that stretches suspension of disbelief well past its breaking point. Worst of all, the climactic scene is nothing but wasted potential- the Big Moment ofthe movie feels tossed off, a hurried attempt to wrap things up now that all the good action scenes are over. But hey, it's still better than Die Hard 2.
B000063DFN|5.0|I picked up this album about a year ago at Sam Goody ( I think...), and I must say, it is still my all-star favorite album. It was this album that got me into the 80's metal era, leading me to artists like Metallica and Megadeth, but even those don't compare the to the glory of Iron Maiden.    I first decided to pick up this album after my brother told me to download Aces High, a good song by this band called Iron Maiden. Yeah I heard of them, but at the time I considered all 80's band carp compared to today's punk. Boy was I wrong. It was one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard and provided enjoyment that I can only compare to when I listened to Avenged Sevenfolds City of Evil album for the first time, and this was just one song.    A week later, after much play through the song I decided to get the album, and I was not disapointed! That was all a year ago, and from then on I stopped listening all these punk bands like fall-out boy and stuff (though still listening to some like Avenged Sevenfold's newer stuff and even gave Dragonforce a go). Alright, enough of that, let me give my review~    Track 1.) Aces High  - One of the best songs on here. Absolute classic, filled with catchy guitar parts, lyrics, and the intro, the intro! Without a doubt a well suited album opener. One of Iron Maidens best songs.    Track 2.) 2 Minutes To Midnight  - Once again, another Iron Maiden classic. A song that will not displease the Iron Maiden fan or any other listeners. Another hit, though I think Aces High is a bit better.    Tack 3.) Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)  - Perhaps my favorite instrumentalist. Though certainly not the best song on the album, I still find those guitar riffs parts playing through my head in the classroom, what can I say, it's catchy!     Track 4.) Flash Of The Blade    Truly an intresting yet enjoyable track. You'll find yourself listening to some facsinating guitar parts that are just delightful for the ear drums. While again, may not be the best song on here, it's still a great listen to.    Track 5.) The Duelists    Alright, I like this track, but I often find myself listening to the other tracks more so then this. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song, but it's quite overshadowed by Aces High and other hits on this album. It won't dissapoint though, I can tell you.    Track 6.) Back in the Village    -Awesome song. Has some parts you may find yourself humming too later on after listening to it and the song nearly paints a story for your enjoyment. Once again, Awesome song.    Track 7.) Powerslave  - This is, by far, my favorite song of all time. I still listen to it reguarly, and still find myself wishing they would put it on guitar hero. Alright, this is one of Iron Maidens best songs, but really underated. You often hear of \\"The Number of the beast\\" and \\"Run to the hills,\\" but solem of \\"Powerslave.\\" REALLY! It's original! It's intresting! It makes awesome work out of Egyptian theme guitar parts! The chorous! Everything! THE SOLO! By far, my favorite solo of all time! I cannot even describe how much fun it is ti listen to or how much fun it would be to play on guitar hero or something! GOD!  Alright... I think I made my point lol. Awesome song, will NOT dissapoint! My opinion, the best track on here =)    Track 8.) Rime Of The Ancient Mariner    - Got 14 minutes to spare? In the mood for an epic-epic? Well, plop this in! BAsed off a popular poem (at that time period I think), \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" is hailed by the fans to be the best track on here (although I think Powerslave is) One of Iron Maidens best, a good closer to the album, and pretty darn enjoyable, it is a great song!    Overall: I've come a long way this past year, but I must say, this album is a must have for fans of Iron Maiden, heavy metal, or the 80's. Seriously, it truly makes me regret I was born in a time where rap about how much money the artist has and how \\"gangsta\\" they are, punk bands, american idol carp, and this dreadful screaming stuff dominate the 'now' music ( I may like Avenged Sevenfolds newer stuff, but I abosolutly HATE there first album). It makes me wish I was born in a time when Iron Maiden was still on their World Slavery tour and Metallica was still performing \\"..And Justice For All\\" at their concerts instead of just teasing the fans with small parts of it...    All in all, one of the best album out there...
B000VR824S|5.0|It's hard to think that the time-worn show-biz advice \\"always leave `em wanting more\\" could be embodied in the context of a four-hour DVD, but I think Eric Clapton and the producers of \\"Eric Clapton Crossroads Guitar Festival 2007\\" pulled it off.  Now, I can't recall Eric having ever been accused of poor taste.  His reputation in that area is alive and well, thanks to the quality of musicians that packed the stage as documented in what may be the finest, most compelling concert movie I've ever seen.    The 2007 event was the second such Crossroads Guitar Festival, staged by Clapton to benefit the Crossroads Centre, a facility in Antigua that treats drug and alcohol addiction, two demons that Clapton has fought and beat.    The planning that went into the event was obviously significant, and the up-front work was worth it.  Dozens of top-shelf musicians, from Blues aristocracy to a sky full of rock'n'roll superstars to rock's next generation of stars, shared a summer day, a beautiful stage, a magnificent sound and video system, and a reved-up throng in a stadium in Chicago's South Side.    I watched the PBS broadcast of this concert in November of 2007 in complete awe, mostly over the same features that are so impressive in this DVD collection.  It must have been a challenge just to decide what to include in this four-hour movie, let alone cut it in half again for a broadcast.    The high-definition video and audio recording is state-of-the art, reflecting the new standard for home entertainment.  This is a product that will likely never be shown in a theater - it was designed with your home theater in mind.    On the two DVDs are 39 songs featuring two many fine musicians to count.  B.B King, Willie Nelson, Sonny Landreth, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, Albert Lee, Robert Cray, John Mayer, Los Lobos all make appearances.  All are excellent (I'm sure this concert was kind of like Monday Night Football for the performers - all the other performers will see it).  Nothing isperfunctory.  No one phones it in.    A number of highlights dot the landscape:    a* John McLaughlin (somewhat annoyingly introduced as \\"Mahi-mahi\\" John Mc.Lauglin\\" by MC Bill Murray, who confirms here that he's always up to the same old trick), who performs a powerfully lyrical, jazz-based raga backed by a rhythm section that reminds me of his days with Miles Davis.    * Doyle Bramhall II fronting a power-trio-plus-second-drummer foursome as they plow through Rosy, a rollicking blues shout inspired by a prison-farm field holler that leaves you feeling that a breakout is imminent.  They follow it up with an incredibly powerful version of \\"Outside Woman Blues,\\" a Blind Joe Reynolds smog recorded years ago by Clapton.  While it's easy to credit the soloist, the real credit goes to the two drummers and bass player, whose vocals, timing, and use of their instruments are outstanding.  Why isn't Doyle Bramhall II a household name?    * Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks, combining for a delicious set that laces together Tedeschi's sinuous vocal lines with differing but complementary licks laid down by both guitarists.   Robert Randolph, playing with The Robert Cray Band, whose enthusiasm so clearly feeds off the crowd's reaction to him at center stage, in his performance of \\"Nobodysoul\\".    * Johnny Winter, very white and very frail, focused as a laser as he roars through Dylan's \\"Highway 61 Revisited.\\"  John Mayer, whose songwriting and guitar mastery surprised me (and probably only me, since it seems I haven't been paying enough attention to him) with a soul/jazz/rock/blues stew to the tempo of a rolling boil on \\"Belief.\\"    * Jeff Beck, a few years ago in danger of permanent assignment to the relic bin, now completely revitalized.  Jeff's buff in a slick black and yellow vest, and his playing is as lyrical and nuanced as ever.  It seems that his performance was in large part successful because of the fiery jazzy musicality and refreshing stage presence of female bassistTal Wilkenfeld, who drives the crowd into a frenzy as she soars through the first solo of Beck's set on \\"Cause We've Ended as Lovers.\\"     After a few token appearances earlier in the show, Clapton checks in pretty much for good about a third of the way through the second disk.  Previously, he appears content to sit stage side, taking photos like a tourist, and biding his time until nightfall.  As an observer, he sometimes seems as in awe of the collected talent as is the audience.  At other times, he is seen schmoozing offstage with his A-list guests.  He knows how to throw a party.  To me, \\"Can't Find My Way Home,\\" \\"Had to Cry Today,\\" and \\"Presence of the Lord\\" stand out because Steve Winwood is onstage playing and singing alongside Clapton, evoking the brief but productive time they spent together in Blind Faith.  Winwood then performs \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy,\\" proving that he had talent while he was part of Traffic, and maybe even The Spencer Davis Trio, too.    Fortunately, this video is not gunked up by tricky camera shots, showy transitions, or useless voice-over narration.  Footage is overlaid mostly to inform or to enhance the viewing experience.    I wish I had been there, if only to have run the commemorative guitar slide concession.

B00007GZR5|4.0|This is a movie for which, I confess, I have a weakness, despite its flaws (the scene is which the lovely, self-assured Leona reveals herself to be Chris's own neglected daughter never fails to bring tears to my normally unsentimental eyes).  Not only is it visually stunning; it does have some fairly profound things to say about love, despair, reconciliation, sacrifice, second chances, and our infinite importance to one another.     I can't help but be amused by all the Heaven/Hell comments. This story is not meant to be a serious comment on the nature of Heaven and Hell. The setting is purely a plot device - a way to deal tangibly with the ideas presented. The movie (and book) are not concerned with the feasibility of traveling from one literal afterworld to another; they are concerned with the worlds we create for ourselves in this life and the way in which we can rescue and be rescued by sacrificial love. This is not an \\"inaccurate\\" presentation of the Christian afterlife; this is Orpheus and Eurydice, and should be judged as such.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|Wow I can't believe I've waited so long for the definitive version of Blade Runner and then all these versions come along at once and all in HD!! I got the 5 disc package delivered yesterday (we can't get it over here in Europe) and watched the final cut version last night. The detail is unbelievable and things I've never noticed before just pop out at you....and this is someone who has watched this movie so many times over the years. The sound is also brilliant. This movie truly is deserving of this treatment as it's one of the great movies. Really anyone who has any interest in movies should be buying this HD version whether it's the 5 disc one or the normal one.
B000J10ERO|5.0|[[ASIN:1420879316 Nana: My grandmother, Anne Gillis]]    In mid 2004, acclaimed director Bryan Singer was offered the chance to direct the new Superman film. Singer jumped at the chance and signed on to direct Superman Returns for Warner Brothers.    Although his influences for the character run the gamut, Singer has a special love for the first Superman movie, starring Christopher Reeve and directed by Richard Donner (STM). Singer even asked for and received Donner's blessing before signing on.    May I say that Bryan Singer has created a masterpiece.    I don't want to give anything away, so let me say that Brandon Routh IS Superman. Kate Bosworth IS Lois Lane. And Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is pure evil and perfect. The rest of the cast - Frank Langella as Perry white, Sam Huntington and Jimmy Olsen, James Marsden as Richard White, and Eva Marie Saint as Ma Kent - they're all perfect. And five year old Tristan Lake Leabu as the little boy who may or may not be Superman's son - is adorable but never annoying.    Since April 2005 I have been following the production of this movie almost daily. I didn't want to get my hopes too high; Superman has disappointed me before.    But I could not have asked for better. I never expected the film to be this big, this good. There was NOTHING I didn't like and dozens of scenes that impressed the hell out of me. I LOVED IT. I will see this film many times - something I haven't done for a film for many years.    Some reviews of this film have commented that the best scenes have already been shown in the 20 TV spots or three trailers. This isn't true. While many terrific scenes have been shown (and you have to LOVE the bullet bouncing off Superman's eyeball shot), you simply can't get an accurate understanding of the movie from minutes of clips. Even if you've read the novel, even if you seen the movie guides, you don't know this film.    There are twists and turns, there are nuances, subtleties, and subtext. The actors bring thesecharacters to vivid life and make us care about the story. The sets and \\"look\\" of the film transport us easily to Metropolis, Smallville, the ruins of Krypton, and to many other places.    Visually, the production design of the film is very impressive. While the Donner film was clearly set in 1978, this film has more of timeless feel, due to the deco style throughout, particularly in the Daily Planet sets, which appear to be a pleasing combination of modern technology with Art Deco facades. This blending of old and new gives the film a timeless feeling. There are deco fixtures next to plasma screens. And everything looks lived in, not shiny like it was just created. And the details, the details, the details... from the framed newspapers on the walls to the unusual facade at the entrance, everything on this set are in the details.    The special effects are simply phenomenal. Finally, we have the technology to show Superman as he was meant to be seen. Many of the shots in this film use advances in movie making magic and computer technology undreamed of just a few years ago. The CGI and other effects are organic to the film, never intrusive, but simply spectacular.    I don't have an adequate superlative to describe the flying sequences. Special effect technology has come so far, even in these last few years. These days, it's not \\"You'll believe a man can fly,\\" because everyone flies around in movies these days -- even Keanu Reeves flew in the Matrix films (and did so realistically; I remember seeing \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" and musing that if a new Superman film were ever made, I hoped that the flying would be that good). These days, the question is, \\"Is the flying believable? Does the flying seem organic to the story or does it look like a special effect? The flying throughout the film is incredible and believable.    The surprises - some telegraphed, some out of nowhere, are brilliant. The look of the picture is stunning. And of course, there's always that wonderful feeling of a summer film - spending two hours in a theater with popcorn and soda, being taken away to another world and enjoying the ride.    Fans will probably be divided over whether the film is too derivative or not derivative enough of other Superman movies/shows, but I think one particular decision will be embraced by all -- the film is dedicated to the memory of Dana and Christopher Reeve.    Acknowledging my lifelong love of the character, I have never been obsessed to the point where I will accept anything. Some interpretations of Superman have been tolerable (the third movie, some of the cartoons), some have been unforgivable (the 1974 musical, the fourth movie) and some have produced outrage and confusion (the comics, \\"Birthright.\\") So I say with no hyperbole whatsoever that the movie is perfect. It was completely worth the wait. I absolutely could not have asked for more. I never expected it to be this good, this perfect.    I loved the story. I loved the nods to the comics and the movies that were everywhere, the cameos, making this universe both new and familiar. I loved that the characters are handled with reverence and respect that the story is meaningful, and the action is intense. The performances are dead on, they are brilliant. The casting is perfect. The film has heart.    Thank you, Bryan Singer. Thank you, Brandon Routh. Thank you to everyone who made this movie a reality.    Superman Returns. Better than ever. The legend intact. The film, perfect.    You will believe, again.
0060589469|1.0|I am now glad I actual slogged through this book for one reason only.  It now solidifies my belief that if a book is getting god awful no matter HOW much of it I have read, I should quit.  I wish I did that after the first 100 pages.    Pirsig's novel contains so many things that make reading a chore, or just flat out PAINFUL.  This isn't a story it's a screed.  This book should have been chopped in more than half consisting of a short story of maybe 100 pages.  You are constantly bombarded by intellectual/philosophical meanderings that go nowhere.  Not only do they go nowhere they are bone dry dull, mindnumbingly deadening, add NOTHING to the story, and are just flat out ridiculous.    Here is how the book reads, pages and pages of blah blah blah blah (repeat for 50 pages)... I get off the bike and change the oil.  blah blah blah blah blah blah... we are heading West now.  blah blah blah blah.    In fact the book is just about the opposite of everything good books are suppose to be.  This book is, plotless, boring, dry, longwinded, pretentious, dull, unfocused, an ego trip for the author, shall I go on????  Seriously this reads like the longest most boring academic paper on the most deranged subject you could think of.  How could you even care about the characters in this book after reading these abhorrent passages that in the end really say nothing.  I am glad I skimmed the last 10 chapters and only read the passages that contained dialogue.  Seriously if you did that you could read this book and understand this story in less than 4/5ths the time it takes to read all the tripe.      I suggest you drive nails through your skull seriously it's less painful than reading this dreck.
B000IJ79WU|3.0|[[ASIN:1420879316 Nana: My grandmother, Anne Gillis]]    THE ROAD TO THE RICHARD DONNER CUT:    Starting in 1977, director Richard Donner filmed SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and SUPERMAN II simultaneously. In order to make the deadline for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, at some point in production it was decided to postpone filming the remaining scenes needed for SUPERMAN II until after SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE was finished.    However, between 50% and 80% of SUPERMAN II was already filmed by Richard Donner before he was replaced/fired by the Salkinds, the producers / financiers of the films.    And although all of his scenes had already been filed, Marlon Brando's footage as Superman's father, Jor-El, was to be cut from SUPERMAN II due to his litigation with the Salkinds and Warners.    Richard Lester took over as director for SUPERMAN II, continuing filming in July 1979. Lester actually re-shot several scenes already lensed by Donner. Donner has suggested this was a move by the Salkinds to deny Donner a director's credit; other have suggested that in order for Richard Lester to earn a directorial credit on the film, SUPERMAN II had to contain at least 51% of his footage, necessitating rewrites and reshoots.    SUPERMAN II, directed by Richard Lester and released in the US in 1981 (overseas in 1980), contained at least 30% (probably more) footage shot by Richard Donner. Although few people knew it at the time, the released version of SUPERMAN II was drastically different than what Donner originally intended. In fact, it was a completely different film than much of what had originally been filmed for SUPERMAN II.    Nevertheless, SUPERMAN II was a box office hit, a critical success, an instant classic and a cherished memory for my generation and the next. I loved the film; have seen it dozens (if not over 100) times and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.    But for almost a decade, as the Internet and Web grew, Superman fans were lobbying to see a Richard Donner Cut of S2; including ALL of the footage he (not Lester) shot. Specifically, they wanted to see Donner's original footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, as well as the different scenes that had been replaced / re-shot by Lester. They wanted to see Donner's vision, Donner's intended \\"companion piece\\" to SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE (STM).    In 2006, that campaign paid off as Warner Brothers authorized the cut. Over nine months, editor Michael Thau located, restored, cleaned up and assembled the Donner S2 footage - six tons of it --- into a very different version of SUPERMAN II. Using the 1977 SUPERMAN II script penned by Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz (who, uncredited, also penned the screenplay for STM), Thau re-edited the film, and added several newly-filmed shots with CGI enhancements.    Thau did a commendable job creating a \\"new\\" film version of S2 as close to Donner's original vision as possible some 25 years later. The film still included Lester footage, but had a decidedly different feeling and was very much a new film, much more in tone with the first Superman film, much more of a true \\"part two\\" to the original film. Over 50% of the RDC was footage never before seen.    Part of my difficulty with reviewing the Richard Donner Cut of SUPERMAN II is that I know the original Lester-directed S2 so well (OK, I can quote the entire movie) that comparison is inevitable and unavoidable, and in some cases I balk when I see how different some scenes are. Some scenes feel \\"wrong\\" only because I am used to seeing them presented in the Lester S2 way. I had that knee-jerk reaction several times - hey, that's not the next scene! Where's the Eiffel Towel sequence? Where's the jump into Niagara's Great Gorge? Where's, \\"General, would you care to step outside?\\"    Getting past that, the RDC is a very good - but not great - film. There's a lot to like, there's a lot to love, but there are also some parts to dislike and some questionable choices.    After 25 years, it's unfair to say which film is \\"better\\" because we've known the Lester cut of S2 since 1981, and it was professionally polished, scored and finished, whereas the RDC is still, in some ways, a fan edit, complete with questionable editing choices in places, pacing issues, and poor music choices in other scenes. Despite being a finished product, there is a somewhat \\"unfinished\\" and \\"rushed\\" quality to it. And it can certainly be argued that most of the flaws in the RDC can be attributed to the fact that it wasn't finished in the first place.    All that said, S2: The Richard Donner Cut is a treasure and Michael Thau has pulled the proverbial rabbit out of his hat and given Superman fans a true Christmas present. Considering the age (and disorganization) of the original footage, that Thau could produce a coherent, nearly complete Donner cut is a hell of an achievement that should not be understated. On the whole, his effort paid off handsomely. And he clearly put a lot of thought (and dare I say, love) into his efforts.    There is so much about the RDC that is far superior to the Lester version of S2 -- the interaction between Margot Kiddor and Christopher Reeve seems so much more natural and fun, and anything with Brando as Jor-El is better than what Lester re-shot. The fact that these Brando scenes were ever cut is a crime. Brando makes this movie, and among other things, the inclusion of the Brando footage gives real weight and emotion to certain key scenes, and even finally answers exactly how Superman gets his powers back at the Fortress of Solitude.    Yes, the RDC is a mixed bag, and as one reviewer said, \\"It is the ultimate deleted scene.\\" But it's much more than that. It's the answer to a wish, a look into what could have been, and like most wishes, both good things and not so good things occur when a wish is granted.    On that note, let's discuss specifics.    THE GOOD (AND THE GREAT):    The film is dedicated in loving memory of Christopher Reeve. In the audio commentary,Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz speak so fondly of Reeve. Very appropriate, very touching.    I thought Donner's thank you video to the fans at the top of the film was very classy.    As the villains break free from the Phantom Zone; Zod shouts, \\"Freeeeeeeee!\\" and the credits roll. Powerful! Scary! Throughout the entire RDC, the villains are much more serious, much more menacing. There is real danger here. All of the Lester slapstick and nonsense has been removed. The \\"cute\\" villain moments are gone. I'm amazed how such subtle editing changed the Zoners from campy to deadly.    After the credits, the film opens with the New York skyline and a new image of the World Trade Center. It's a little jarring to see the WTC in a \\"new\\" film post September 11, but the twin tower's construction was completed in 1973, just four years before Superman was filmed. No effort was made to remove the WTC from the film, and I am grateful for that. Whether it's the Lester cut or Donner cut, visually SUPERMAN II is clearly a period piece set in the late 1970s and to remove the iconic WTC would be wrong.  In a many of the scenes we have previously viewed, Thau uses different angles of the same take. Nice touch and adds to the \\"new film\\" feeling.    The new opening at the Daily Planet in which Lois sees Clark's resemblance to Superman - fantastic. Reeve and Kidder look like they had so much fun filming this scene--it's playful, immediately shows Lois Lane is nobody's fool, and demonstrates how well Reeve played Clark Kent. Donner's direction really shows here.    The additional banter between Lex and Eve is hilarious. Lex's comment that you never use the words \\"Lex and Wrong\\" in the same sentence is great. Some of their scenes go on a little too long, but usually they're worth it.    Every scene with Brando as Jor-El is better than the Lester scene where he was replaced, although Susannah York DID do a great job in the Lester version of S2. Having Brando back as Jor-El adds such strong (and needed) continuity to the first film.    Superman's identity revealed: Even though it's two different screen tests and Chris Reeve is probably 20 pounds lighter and made up differently in one half of it, the merged Donner scene in which Lois fires the gun at Clark, who is forced to reveal his true identity, is excellent. After Clark removes his glasses and admonishes Lois that had she been wrong, Clark Kent would be dead, Lois deadpans, \\"With a blank?\\" and then she smiles. \\"Gotcha.\\" Brilliant writing and execution.    However: Although this Donner scene is superior to the Lester revelation scene where Clark trips over the pink polyester bear rug, one crucial aspect the Donner screen test lacks is the follow-up between Clark and Lois. In the Lester version, after Clark has tripped and fallen and plunged his hand into the fireplace, his glasses come off and Lois yelps, \\"Clark! Let me look at it!\\" Clark fumbles to put his glasses back on and hide his uninjured hand but Lois can see he's not burned at all. It's an emotional scene, well acted, and tender.    I miss that beautiful scene. Despite the setting - a garish polyester honeymoon suite - the acting is intense, sincere, and some of Kidder and Reeve's best work in the series and a triumph for Lester. It's a shame some sort of meld of the Donner scene with this Lester scene wasn't possible, but it would be too jarring.    When the villains arrive in Midwestern America, the removal of the Lester lame humor and sight gags is very welcome, improves the movie dramatically, and gives the villains a FAR more menacing quality.    The exchange where Jor-El warns Superman of the dangers of falling in love is powerful. This scene's exclusion in the original S2 is inexcusable and wrong. Brando is brilliant here. He is PLEADING with his son not to give up his powers.    Think, Kal-El! I beg you! Think!    And when Jor-El ask him, \\"Is this how you repay their gratitude? By abandoning the weak, the defenseless, theneedy - for the sake of your selfish pursuits?\\" I loved Superman's incredulous, \\"Selfish, after all I've done for them? At least they have a chance for happiness! I only ask the same, nothing more.\\" is excellent. And there's Lois, after making love to Superman, wearing only Superman's shirt and socks, watching. As Superman's powers are destroyed, Jor-El just stares at her hatefully- and she backs up, terrified. Love it.    Great addition: General Zod smiling as he shoots people with the machine gun. Really shows how evil he is.    Now we come to the money scene--A powerless and bruised Superman arrives at the Fortress of Solitude. (Only gripe--Lester's choice to darken the fortress a deep, gloomy green is much more effective than Donner's choice to keep the Fortress all lit up. In the Lester version, the fortress is dark green, cold and dead. Visually it made more sense.)    That quibble aside, this is THE scene we have waited to see, and it was SO worth the wait. Jor-El appears, speaks to Superman, and dies in order to restore his son's powers.    Superman: \\"Father... I failed, I failed you, I failed myself and all humanity. I traded my birthright for a life of submission in a world that is now ruled by your enemies. There's no one left to help them now, the people of the world, not since I... FATHER!\\"    The Green crystal glows... He picks it up, inserts it into the control panel... He's shivering...    Jor-El: \\"Listen carefully, my son, for we shall never speak again. If you hear me now, then you have made use of the only means left to you - the crystal source through which our communication was begun. The circle is now complete. You have made a dreadful mistake, Kal-El. You have abandoned the world for the sake of private ambition. You did this of your own free will, and in spite of all I could say to dissuade you. Now you have returned here to me for one last chance to redeem yourself. This too - finally - I have anticipated, my son. (pause) Look at me, Kal-El... Once before, when you were small, I died while giving you a chance for life. And now, even though it will exhaust the final energy left within me... Look at me, Kal-El!... The Kryptonian prophecy will be at last fulfilled. The son becomes the father - the father becomes the son. Goodbye forever, Kal-El. Remember me, my son...\\"    And Jor-El appears in corporeal form and lays his hand on Superman's shoulder, as Superman shudders and white light engulfs him.    IN-CRED-IBLE. This is the CORE of the father-son relationship theme of both films. The acting is compelling, poetic, and strong.    HOW COULD THEY CUT THIS SCENE IN THE LESTER VERSION?    Back in Metropolis...    The battle has started! Great moment: Jimmy re-entering the office with Perry's coffee and Lex steals it out of his hand. Jimmy argues that the coffee was the Chief's and Lex counters calmly that, \\"The Chief's got it.\\"    I loved the new edits -- during the battle over Metropolis, the focus in on what's going on at the Daily Planet, especially with Jimmy, Lois and Perry--not on stupid sight gags and goofy slapstick humor, or people we don't care about (like Luanne).    The battle over Metropolis, with a few exceptions, is pretty much the same, mostly Richard Lester footage and very good. Glad to see the slapstick (such as the guy on the phone continuing the conversation after his phone booth is knocked over and blown away) have been removed. This Lester-filmed battle was always VERY good, and Donner's inclusions of the few battle shots he filmed (such as Superman hitting and destroying the Statue's of Liberty's torch) is very cool.    The final confrontation at the Fortress is far better than the Lester version. No silly \\"ray-beam\\" or \\"invisible\\" powers, no ripping the S-shield into a piece of cellophane. We just have Zod tell Superman, very matter-of-factly: \\"Your father once condemned us to eternal living death. Your fate shall be the same. You will live, Kal-El. Forever - as my slave. If not, then others will pay for your stubborn attitude. Innocent people, millions of them if necessary --- Beginning with her.\\" and he nods to Lois.    And in this edit of the film, that's all it takes, Given everything we've seen, we KNOW Zod will literally destroy the world to get his way. He's THAT dangerous.    Impressive.    After the final battle, Superman destroys the fortress and he and Lois end their relationship:    SUPERMAN: \\"Look, Lois, I...\\"    LOIS: (brave smile) \\"Hey. No... regrets, you know? I mean I did it, didn't I? I got the man I love to love me?\\"    SUPERMAN: (Sincerely) \\"Oh, yeah.\\"    LOIS: \\"So okay, then. So they need you too. I'd be buying my personal little rainbow at the cost of all those people who say, \\"Help, come quick ... you think I don't understand that? It's the old eternal triangle, right? Except in my case I've got all of humanity in the next bedroom.\\"    SUPERMAN: \\"We'll see each other. All the time, like before. But it can't be like...\\"    LOIS kisses him passionately. He responds in spite of himself. They break. She looks up at him, trembling.    LOIS: \\"Just don't forget, that's all.\\"    Poetic, beautifully written and acted. Powerful. Poignant.    Finally, the new wrap-up at the Daily Planet is very sweet, really showing the fondness Lois has for Clark, and I liked his offer to pay for the pizza. Just a sweet scene.    Now we move on to the ... NOT SO GOOD:    Many of my complaints about the RDC have already echoed by reviewers nationwide. The recap of the events in STM is just too long--well over five minutes. Lester's recap in S2 - with the credits interweaved with the relevant events of the first movie - worked much better even though it ran in about the same time.    Bathroom humor. Why? Why in the world restore the god-awful bathroom humor? In prison, \\"Slasher Folgelstein is a bed-wetter.\\" \\"Did you go pssht?\\" \\"Why didn't you go before we left?\\" And the absolute worst - a toilet flushing sound in the fortress of solitude. It's beyond juvenile - it's painful.    The Music - Thau elected to reuse the John Williams score from the first film rather than the Ken Thorne composition of the Williams music from S2. The result is a decidedly mixed bag. The music just feels wrong in some places, or the wrong piece of music was chosen in many places. Since all the music is \\"reused\\" and wasn't written with S2 in mind, it never quite dovetails and is actually distracting in some places.    Luthor's escape from Prison is waaaaayyyyyy too long.    Editing / pacing: Maybe it's just that I know the Lester version of S2 too well, but some of the editing is just not too good. The smash cut to Niagara Falls is jarring, and in some cases the editing is a little distracting. The pacing is a little slow, and in this new film, Superman (in costume) doesn't appear in new footage until 40 minutes into the film, unlike the Lester version of S2 where Kent switches to Superman the first three minutes of the film.    The courtship dinner at the fortress is cut before Lois says, \\"I'm going to change into something more comfortable\\" and feels rushed.    There are two instances where Superman's \\"S\\" is clearly backwards. Sorry, but that's just sloppy.    Biggest gripe of all--Superman turns the world around to reverse time - AGAIN? I understand that this was the original ending of S2, and at some point the decision was made to move this effect to the first film. In the Lester version of S2, Kent gives Lois the much-derided \\"memory erasing kiss\\" but everyone else remembers the attack of the Phantom Zone villains. In this movie, Superman reverses time to the point where the Donner Cut of the movie never even happens. I understand Donner would have come up with a new ending for SUPERMAN II had he been allowed to continue, but the time-reversal thing in two movies feels worse than a cheat.    On that note, as many reviewers have said, if Superman has reversed time, why does everyone at the diner recognize him at the end of the film? Sure, it brings emotional closure to have Kent give Rocky the bully a taste of his own medicine, but in this \\"new timeline\\" the two have never met.  However...    HOW I WOULD HAVE ENDED THE DONNER CUT:    REMOVE THE TURN-BACK-TIME GIMMICK COMPLETELY.    After the Fortress battle...    The Phantom Zone villains and Luthor are taken away by the Artic police. Why relegate this to the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" section?    Superman destroys the fortress, and Lois and Superman end their relationship in the arctic.    After Lois and Superman speak on her balcony, he flies off and DOES NOT TURN TIME BACKWARD. Since Lois has clearly accepted the reality of the situation, there is no need to make her forget anything. They're both adults. She understands. It would play so much better.    Lois begins typing \\"Superman saves the world\\"    Scrap the new Daily Planet scene. Since Superman didn't turn back time it would no longer make sense and isn't necessary to further the plot.    Then, Kent returns to the diner and gets his revenge on Rocky.    Superman flies the flag back to the White House (Lester footage but very symbolic and powerful)    Superman flies into space / end credits.    For me, it would just work better. Forget continuity (Lois knowing the secret). Superman III and SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE are forgettable and SUPERMAN RETURNS is a \\"vague sequel\\" anyway.    SUMMARY    It would be unfair to take away anything from Richard Lester for his version of S2. While I don't agree with some of his choices and re-shoots, despise the slapstick humor (and SUPERMAN III - Lester's baby start to finish -- was horrible) Lester arguably did his best with what he had to work with in an awkward situation back in 1979, and many of his choices for \\"his\\" S2 were very good and overall, his version of S2 holds up very well even after all these years. I still love it; it's still a classic. The revelation to Lois, the powerless Superman returning to the dark, empty fortress, \\"General, wouldyou care to step outside?\\" the Niagara Falls rescue, the Great Gorge jump, the majority of the battle over Metropolis are all Lester footage and very well done.    I miss the entire Paris scene at the Eiffel Tower. I miss Kent running into the alley at the top of the film, ripping open his shirt to reveal the \\"S\\" and blurring at super-speed into Superman. It's a great effect, iconic. A few minutes into the Lester film, Superman is flying to the rescue. That moment ranks as one of my favorites in the entire series. In the Donner cut, we never see Kent change to Superman.    And so I would be remiss if I did not say, thank you Richard Lester, for your Superman II. I still love it, warts and all.    Two visions of the same film--both with great strengths and certain weaknesses and distractions.    So much of the RDC is brilliant and one can really see how this \\"true companion piece\\" to STM would have unfolded.      Had Donner been allowed to complete his version of S2 back in 1979, the issues with music and pacing and editing wouldn't exist. So while this review mentions the editing/pacing/music issues with this cut, it is certainly understood they would have been corrected in a perfect world.    No matter what, Michael Thau has done a terrific job and made our dream come true. Many thanks to him, as well as Warner Brothers, for making it possible to see Richard Donner's original vision of S2.    Thank you to all the fans who lobbied for this version of the film.    And to Richard Donner, there are no words to thank you for all you have done to define Superman for generations to come. Thank you for your dedication, determination, and your vision. And thank you to everyone (especially Michael Thau) responsible for bring this restored vision of S2 to life. It was well worth the wait.
B000UO338W|5.0|I saw that this album had a four star average, and I just had to chime in to boost the average, because I feel passionately that this is one of Ministry's best. After more than two decades, they're still on top of the pile. Thanks in part to an undeniably grim political landscape worldwide, Al and crew are fueled to create an outstanding piece of work.
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|\\"Star Trek: Insurrection,\\" the ninth Star Trek feature film and third film outing for the \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" (ST:TNG) cast, is a solid action story, featuring a morality tale, humor, and for the first time in a while for a Trek film, romance. In addition, this movie features far more location shooting than any previous trek film, which gives the film a grand scale.    \\"Insurrection\\" opens as the captain of the Federation Starship Enterprise, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), learns that one of his officers, the android Data, has apparently gone berserk and taken a cultural survey team hostage on a planet populated by the mysterious Ba'ku people.    Picard and his crew arrive at the Ba'ku planet, where the Federation and another alien race, the Son'a (a nasty looking group) are conducting the cultural survey of this village of 600 people. The Ba'ku are very intelligent and highly developed, but have adopted a simple life on this planet.    The Ba'ku village - filmed in Sierra Nevada and stunningly beautiful - is the most interesting and gorgeous set ever constructed for a Trek film. As the opening credits roll, the camera shows children playing, and a breathtaking view of a rural community built along a sparkling lake, mountains in the background, livestock grazing and simple, happy people living a peaceful life.    But the Ba'ku planet holds an amazing secret: Its inhabitants are over three centuries old. Unusual rings surrounding the planet have created a \\"fountain of youth\\" effect. Anyone who goes to the planet will grow younger and live forever.    The Enterprise crew soon learn that the \\"cultural survey\\" is only a cover for a sinister plot to kidnap the Ba'ku, exile them from their world, and exploit the planet's fountain of youth properties for the Son'a, who we learn are an ancient, dying race. The Federation also wants to exploit this special planet, and considers the Ba'ku expendable, and obstacles in the way of progress. Why spare amere 600 people for a planet that can grant eternal youth to millions? Or billions?    What makes this change of policy so compelling for Star Trek fans is that Starfleet would previously never have embraced such a plan. But we are reminded that the squeaky-clean Star Trek of the original series and ST:TNG have given way to a more gritty, more dangerous universe. For the latter half of the current Star Trek TV series \\"Deep Space Nine,\\" Starfleet has been at war with several belligerent cultures - and is feeling the pressure. The glory days of the Federation are over, it seems.    Picard is furious: If an entire people can be forcibly removed, destroying their culture and way of life, when does it stop? How many people before the act is wrong? A thousand? Ten thousand?    \\"Who the hell are we to choose the next course of evolution for these people?\\" Picard asks.    For Picard, the principles that the Federation is founded on have to be upheld. The Prime Directive - which maintains that any civilization must be permitted to develop at its own pace -- must be preserved. Picard takes a stand, deciding he must put his career and loyalties on the line, and protect the Ba'ku homeworld. Naturally, his entire crew join him in the rebellion.    Making moral choices has always been part of the Star Trek tradition, and the stand-out episodes and movies have been those that stay true to the original premise of the show - entertain the viewers, and have a strong message underneath. Whether the topic is warfare, birth control, drugs, prejudice, or even saving the whales, these are the best treks.    This time around, a benevolent government is being manipulated into doing something evil for a \\"greater good.\\" The comparison to many of history's forced moves of a group of people by one more powerful -- such as the American Indians - is obvious.    But there's also a second underlying message - living in the moment. Picard's love interest, Anij, asks Picard, \\"Have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time . . . when time seemed to stop . . . and you could almost lived in that moment?\\" The Ba'ku have discovered that a single moment in time can be \\"a universe in itself.\\" It's a terrific commentary about the insane pace of modern life - whether it be in the 24th century of Star Trek, or right now in the 20th.    The crew reacts to the planet's \\"fountain of youth\\" properties in many ways; the most amusing is the normally stoic Picard, who forgoes his usual classical music for a rumba, and then begins dancing to the music. The scene is absolutely endearing. The cast's youthful reactions inject this film with a great deal of energy, and fun.    My one complaint about the film is a scene where Picard pursues Data in a shuttle-chase through the Ba'ku planet's atmosphere. Unable to reach through Data's temporary dementia, Picard recalls that Data had been rehearsing a scene from HMS Pinafore and breaks into song. This gets through to Data, who begins singing as well. It's an embarrassing moment, clearly played for laughs, and the film would be better without it.    Still, the movie will appeal to trekkers and non-trekkers alike. The story is compelling and also fun. With over fifty standing sets and far more location shooting than any previous Star Trek film, the movie feel bigger. The exodus of the Ba'ku at night is pure Cecil B. DeMille. There are space battles, computer generated pets (as in the Lost in Space film), armed conflict and lots of action, and of course, the Enterprise once again gets hammered by enemy fire. Picard has a real love interest, and all the regular ST:TNG supporting characters have interesting roles (including regulars Riker and Troi, who rekindle their previous romance). In fact, it's very obvious that the cast had a lot of fun making the film - they've so grown into their roles that they, for the first time, feel like \\"real people.\\" It's unusual to see Star Trek characters acting so... well... so colorful and animated. The on-screen camaraderie, friendship and romance is very believable. It all makes for an exciting, interesting film.    Joining the cast this time are F. Murray Abraham as the sinister Son'a leader Ru'afo, who won an Oscar for Best Actor as Amadeus. Picard's love interest Anij is played by Donna Murphy, a Tony Award winner for her performances in The King and I and Passion. Anthony Zerbe, who plays Starfleet Admiral Dougherty, won an Emmy Award for his role on ABC-TV's Harry O, and has appeared memorably in such films as Cool Hand Luke, Papillon, and License to Kill.    Regular cast member Jonathan Frakes, who did a commendable job directing the previous Trek film, has also directed episodes of ST:TNG, Trek's \\"Deep Space Nine,\\" and \\"Voyager,\\" as well as Diagnosis: Murder and University Hospital.    Star Trek remains a profitable franchise for owner Paramount, with films, television shows, books and other merchandize grossing more than $1 billion worldwide. This film's predecessor, \\"Star Trek: First Contact,\\" produced the biggest opening-weekend gross of any of the Star Trek films, and earned $92 million at the box office.    \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" does the franchise proud.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|[[ASIN:1420879316 Nana: My grandmother, Anne Gillis]]    Disaster movies have been popular for years. Take many big name (and not so big name) celebrities, place them in a dangerous setting, add incredible special effects, then watch them survive (or die trying).    There were disaster films set in airplanes (\\"Airport\\" and its many sequels) capsizing ships (\\"The Poseidon Adventure,\\") burning buildings (\\"Towering Inferno,\\") cities destroyed by things from outer space (\\"Meteor,\\" \\"Fire in the sky,\\") as wells as floods, fires, earthquakes and all kinds of other celluloid catastrophes.    So when I first heard about Titanic, I was anticipating another disaster film. One with a very, very large budget, but still a disaster film. The Poseidon Adventure part II, perhaps.    Oh, my, was I wrong. And so was everyone else.    This film affects each one who sees it in a unique and personal way, and after three viewing I feel I must share my impressions. Simply put, you MUST see this film. You must experience one of the grander offerings Hollywood has given us while it's on the big screen. You must experience this story for yourself.    Women who see Titanic are sobbing at the end. Big, burly guys leave red-eyed, sniffling. You can't help it. Often we go to the movies and our minds wander, or we leave to go the bathroom or buy more popcorn. Not this time. With this movie, no one leaves. People lean forward in their chairs watching the drama unfold. They're spellbound.    For three and a half hours you leave the theater and go back to that terrible night of April 15, 1912. You see this film and you think, \\"this is what movie making is supposed to be about.\\" Epic. Larger than life. Pure escapism. And much more.    Why is this film such a success? Why are people seeing it again and again? Why the Golden Globe awards and a sure-fire Oscar night sweep?    Well, there are many reasons, and the first is realism. History, by and large, can be a pretty dry subject. There are facts, figures and events, but often there's no personal connection. The words, \\"Titanic hit an iceberg and 1500 people died when it sank,\\" are just words. Sure, it must have been very catastrophic, but we never met any of those people. That was 85 years ago. It doesn't convey any sense of tragedy.    Where Titanic succeeds first -- and it does so on many levels -- is that its realism is so striking that you feel as though one of the passengers was filming the entire event with a camcorder. Every detail (costumes, props, mannerisms, dress, sets, china patterns, etc.) is so perfectly recreated that very quickly you forget you're watching a movie. The illusion is so perfect that you never once think of what you're seeing as a \\"re-creation.\\" The verisimilitude is tangible.    As such, you cringe as people die. You feel the panic as people fight for a slot on one of the few remaining lifeboats. As the water rises and crashes through staterooms and corridors, your pulse quickens. You shudder at the lifeless bodies bobbing in the frigid Atlantic. You almost feel the cold. You watch an \\"unsinkable\\" ship be consumed by the unforgiving sea.    \\"But this ship can't sink!\\" Ismay cries.    And Titanic's builder, Andrews, replies, \\"She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty.\\" You know the ship is doomed. And you are a witness to its sinking.    This is no fictitious ship or skyscraper, but a very real ocean liner whose actual twisted wreckage on the floor of the Atlantic is seamlessly matched with the recreations of those long ago days.    You see the history, and you learn. You learn what a beautiful ship Titanic was, how strong, how fast. A ship of dreams. You learn why the ship sank, and how. You learn that the band played on deck until the ship sank, and that the lights stayed on almost until the same time. That the ship broke in half after lifting its stern into the air. You learn how human arrogance led to the disaster. You might haveknown some of these things before, but now they seem more real. Almost like you were really there.    But what makes the film such a true success is the love story. Rose DeWitt Bukater, an upper-class American suffocating under the strict expectations of high society, and Jack Dawson, a free-spirited poor boy, never really sailed aboard Titanic, but they -- and the characters around them -- are so well-written and acted that you believe they might have. They could have. For three and a half hours, they really did.    No one in this film is a cartoon stereotype. Even Rose's icy mother, who on the outside appears to be just a stuffy, aloof high-society woman, is revealed to be on the verge of poverty, desperately trying to marry Rose into wealth. \\"We're women,\\" she laments sadly. \\"Our choices are few.\\" The dramatic class war between first class and steerage is complex and vivid. First class socializes in stuffy formal tea, cigar and dinner parties. They're dull and bored. Below decks, the \\"have nots\\" have rowdy, wild step dancing parties filled with music, singing, laughter, arm-wrestling and much drinking. They have nothing, yet they need nothing -- absolute joy permeates the air. Attending such a party, Rose cuts loose and has a wonderful time. \\"Money can't buy happiness\\" never seemed more obvious.    As disaster strikes and the \\"haves\\" wonder if the lifeboats will be loaded by class, the \\"have nots\\" merely fight for their right to be rescued as well. And for many of the lower class, there is a quiet dignity as they accept the inevitable (a mother tucking her children in bed as others scramble to escape), while the rich use any means to escape the doomed ship (Cal using someone else's child as a ticket onto the \\"women and children only\\" lifeboat).    Titanic is filled with powerful scenes. Rose's wordless observation of a little girl being trained in the proper way to sit up straight at a table and fold a napkin -- the look on Rose's face conveys her rejection forthat code of conduct and way of life.    A father consoles his sobbing children and wife as they board a life boat, \\"Don't cry... It's OK, they have another boat for the daddies.\\" But the look between husband and wife says it all: I'll never see you again.    In another scene, you marvel at the kind way \\"Unsinkable\\" Molly Brown fondly looks after Jack and lends him a tuxedo. Throughout the film, you believe that 101 old Rose holds a love for Jack that has withstood 84 years. In a tasteful and non-explicit scene, as Rose and Jack make love for the first time, you feel the passion they share, and you believe they are really in love.    Despite the tragedy, the film is also surprisingly filled with many scenes that make you smile or are very humorous. The amusing way Jack -- clearly a fish out of water -- attempts to emulate the walk and gestures of the upper class is very funny and endearing. Jack teaching Rose to spit -- something she admits she never learned in finishing school -- shows the different worlds they come from. And in the memorable scene where Jack sketches Rose in the nude, Rose teases him: \\"I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artist. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.\\" \\"He does landscapes,\\" Jack replies.    James Horner's soundtrack is haunting and beautiful, and as the credits roll and Celine Dion's \\"My heart will go on\\" begins to play, you'll just be staring at the screen, amazed at how perfect a movie-going experience can be. \\"Love can touch us one time / and last for a lifetime.\\"     When you do, then you'll understand.

B00003CX5P|2.0|[[ASIN:1420879316 Nana: My grandmother, Anne Gillis]]    Of the eighty quadrillion reviews written or televised about this eagerly awaited Star Wars prequel, most seem to have a common summary: The film is technically brilliant, stunning and innovative in its scope and visual computer-generated wizardry, but painfully slow, actually dull in some places, and has little or no character development and little human drama.    I was disappointed to learn that the critics are correct. But let's talk about the good stuff first.    First up, there isn't a word powerful enough to describe the amazing technological leaps that Lucas had made in computer magic. Of course, Lucas founded the Industrial Light and Magic special effects company that has created some of the most innovative, impressive and memorable effects in movies for the last two decades. What's amazing is that he keeps raising the bar - the effects just keep getting better.    A full 95% of the scenes in Phantom Menace have some degree of digital component, with live people interacting seamlessly with computer-generated characters. The fully-three dimensional landscapes and scenes are so realistic that you actually get vertigo. The Jedi temple and planet Coruscan scenes are breathtaking. Make no mistake, when it comes to cinematic breakthroughs, Lucas still sets the standards others are measured by.    The little touches in Phantom Menace are nice as well - the fact that spaceships and light-sabers cast shadows on the ground, that control panels are in an alien language and not English, that you actually see waterfalls flowing in obviously computer-generated vistas, all make for a more believable experience. Also, since this prequel takes place thirty years before the other Star Wars movie, Lucas made an effort to make the technology look a little more quaint and primitive. He succeeded.    The sets - the real ones not created by computer, such as the interiors of Queen Amidala's place - shot in a real palace inItaly, are awe-inspiring. Speaking of the queen, I liked Natalie Portman as Amidala. Not just because of the interesting accent she speaks in, and the cool costumes she wears, but this 17 year old is terrific in her role as the young ruler of the planet Naboo. The movie doesn't tell us, but we know from the hype, that Amidala is destined to marry Anakin Skywalker, the future evil Darth Vader, and give birth to the twins Luke and Lea, the heroes from the fist Star Wars movies. So it's great that there's chemistry between her character and young Anakin, played by Jake Lloyd. But we'll get to him in a Moment.    Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are well-cast as the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobie. Kenobie, or course, was played with style and flair by Sir Alec Guinness in the previous Star Wars movies, and McGregor does the younger version of the character justice while still making it his own. Unfortunately, neither character is given a lot to do. Kenobie, in fact, spends much of the first part of the movie on board a ship, making repairs and talking to Qui-Gon Jin on a futuristic communicator.    Samuel L. Jackson appears in a cameo as a member of the Jedi Council; he has a lot of presence on film and you end up wishing he had more to do in the film.    Unfortunately, there's a lot to dislike about the picture, and I'll start with the most aggravating, maddeningly irritating character I have ever seen on film: The computer-generated Jar Jar Binks, who is a silly, floppy-eared vest-wearing frog-man with an absolutely incomprehensible accent. This character, supposedly played for laughs, hurts the film, and gives an infinitely greater weight to the word \\"annoying\\" than anything imaginable. This \\"comic sidekick\\" character detracts from the main story so severely that I honestly considered walking out twenty-minutes into the film.    And what's the deal with the new villain, the devil-faced Darth Maul? We get no insight into this character whatsoever, except that he is obviously a very bad man with extremely fake-looking horns glued to his head, and that he's very adept with a light-saber. Beyond that, nothing.    The battle scenes featuring entire battalions of computer generated robots and characters is breathtaking in scope, but quickly becomes a little boring. There simply isn't anything compelling about watching thousands of robots and unreal characters being killed or exploding. It's a big video game with no human connection, and really no reason to care what happens. In fact, the battle scenes are so massive and complex that the mind occasionally wanders with thoughts of, \\"This must have cost a lot of money to make.\\" When one lengthy battle scene ended, I almost expected the screen to flash \\"GAME OVER, insert 25 cents to play again.\\"    My biggest disappointment in the film is the waste of the character of Anakin Skywalker. This has nothing to do with actor Jake Lloyd, who plays the young version of the dark lord. Lloyd is very likable, and although his character seems written to be almost a \\"Home Alone\\" cute-as-pie moppet, you never get annoyed with him because he's interesting: He loves his mother, is tough but vulnerable, can fix any machine, can build androids like C3P0, and pilots a pod-racer like Mario Andretti.    And that's the biggest problem--We know that he'll grow up to be Darth Vader. But we don't believe it. Not for a second. It makes no sense. The kid is pure sugar, all \\"Gee-Whiz, Mom, can I go be a Jedi, yippee!\\" and there isn't even a HINT of a darker side - he never even throws a temper tantrum. This kid should be on TV, hawking Grape Juice.    Yes, the two planned sequels will deal with Anakin's transformation from good to evil, but the transition would be more believable if we saw even a glimmer of the evil that is to come. All we get is Jedi Master Yoda's cryptic feeling that the boy is dangerous. We know he'll be evil. This movie should have at least given is a glimpse of WHY. Ahint. As \\"Austin Powers\\" Doctor Evil says, \\"Throw me a bone here!\\"    No doubt Phantom Menace will make hundreds of millions and Star Wars fans will see it in droves repeatedly. But remembering back to the amazing explosion of the original Star Wars film in 1977, how it changed the future of movie making, and having waited 16 years for the new sequel, I was expecting a lot more story.    Much like the first Star Trek movie, which had a weak plot and was bogged down by endless special effects, Phantom Menace could have been so much more if the special effects had been pared down a notch in favor of more character development and human drama. A little more humor wouldn't have hurt either. The incredible visuals and good acting simply aren't enough to carry a movie. The underlying story feels underdeveloped.    Parts II and III are better, but that is they say, another story.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I first saw this movie back in 2000, just after its release... I felt so good by paying my ticket for such a great film. Its hard to see good movies nowadays or be satisfied or happy after watching a movie in theaters, its almost always the same garbage over and over again... Now after seven years, I can still saying the same thing, there're quite few films (at least that I've seen) with such a great power and emotion transmited.  This one -for me- its a must buy.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|[[ASIN:1420879316 Nana: My grandmother, Anne Gillis]]  MAGIC is Bruce Springsteen's new studio recording and his first with the E Street Band in five years. It's a solid rock/pop offering; Springsteen has left the folksy styles of THE SEEGER SESSIONS and TOM JOAD behind (for now) and from the first notes it's obvious this album is intended as a sequel to THE RISING - solid rock & roll, a sound throughout that makes you want to get up and dance (or jump up and shake your fist), and like RISING, deeply layered with commentary about current events.    This layering makes MAGIC arguably one of Springsteen's best efforts, and what amazes me is that it is both familiar AND fresh. Many of the tracks feel like they could have been unreleased cuts from previous albums such as BORN IN THE USA, THE RIVER and BORN TO RUN; in fact, MAGIC not only uses classic lyrics from the older albums, but there are definite musical homages from JUNGLELAND and many others. This album is recognizably Springsteen but brand new.    Springsteen's songwriting on MAGIC is infused with subtle (and sometimes obvious) outrage at what has happened to his beloved America in 2007. As the five-star review in Rolling Stone so eloquently stated, \\"[Springsteen] makes no direct references to Iraq, Bush or the so-called Patriot Act. He doesn't need them.\\"    I've read reviews commenting about those references that Springsteen infused in MAGIC, but to be absolutely honest, the first two times I listened to the CD, I didn't catch any of it. My friend David -- also a Bruce fanatic -- was incredulous I missed them, but on closer listen and careful reading of the lyrics, the message IS there, screaming at you. I usually \\"get\\" what Springsteen is saying in his music, but the first pass or two this time around, I missed it. Shame on me--MAGIC is layered with commentary about America 2007 - and Springsteen isn't happy about what's happened to his beloved country.    1. RADIO NOWHERE    With the Tommy Tutone-ish opening riff, the E-Street Band is back! \\"I was trying to find my way home...\\" the song begins - a common theme in so much of Springsteen's work.    \\"Is there anybody alive out there?\\" Is there any concert where Bruce hasn't called out that very question? He's looking for a connection. Classic Bruce. Sort of a follow-up to 57 CHANNELS (AND NOTHING ON), RADIO NOWHERE is a powerhouse anthem and an obvious indictment of the homogenized, generic wasteland of corporate driven contemporary radio. \\"I Just want to hear some rhythm / I want a thousand guitars / I want pounding drums.\\" Great to hear Clarence's Saxophone. Awesome.    2. YOU'LL BE COMIN' DOWN    This song has a distinctly 60s feeling to it, and Springsteen's vocals are very, very good here - notable for the man who is arguably not the greatest singer (and I love the guy). A \\"she done him wrong\\" song? Sounds like it (except I wonder if the line about \\"crushed metal of your little flying machine\\" is a war reference)? The lines \\"You'll be fine as long as your pretty face holds out / Then it's gonna get pretty cold out'' reminds me of the favorite TUNNEL OF LOVE track WHEN YOU'RE ALONE: \\"Now that pretty form that you've got baby / Will make sure you get along.\\" Smooth, smoldering vocals, great guitars. This is a track to play again and again and crank it on the car stereo -- I LOVE this song.    3. LIVIN' IN THE FUTURE    \\"My ship Liberty sailed away / on a bloody red horizon.\\" Another song that feels like an outtake from BITUSA - (or THE RIVER -- definite nods to HUNGRY HEART here) -- familiar, but fresh. Very powerful, and damned scary. As Springsteen explained on the TODAY SHOW on September 28: \\"So now, in the last six years, we've had to add to the American picture: rendition, illegal wiretapping, voter suppression, no habeas corpus, the neglect of our great city of New Orleans and her people, an attack on the Constitution, and the loss of our best young men and women in a tragic war. This is a song about things thatshouldn't happen here, happening here. And so right now we plan to do something about it, we plan to sing about it. I know it's early, but it's late...\\"    Springsteen talks about so many bad things happening to America in 2007, but don't worry darling, none of this has happened yet, right? Right? Right?    4. YOUR OWN WORST ENEMY    This one should have been a B-Side. Not that B-Sides even exist anymore (or 45s, or ALBUMS, for that matter) but this one sounds and feels like something more suited for \\"TRACKS II\\" ten years from now. There's an obvious allusion to the world before and after September 11, but the sound, the lyrics, the vocals... Nothing on this one is compelling to me. The song feels unfinished, a work in progress and sort of a throwaway. Reading the Magic tour's set lists (as of November 13), Springsteen only played this one a few times. For me, it stalls the momentum built up so far.    5. GYPSY BIKER    One of the most powerful songs on this album. From the opening guitar and harmonica, you think \\"THE RIVER.\\" Haunting. Beautiful. And interestingly, if you are familiar with the Gordon Lightfoot classic, \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\\" there are definite musical nods to that song's sound as well.    The guitars on this song are scorching. The biker of the title is a dead soldier whose friends have gathered to mourn his passing. His belongings have been gathered and sold, but his friends take his bike out of the garage, polish it, and take it out into the desert and set it on fire - a funeral pyre, a ceremonial goodbye.    \\"You asked me that question, I didn't get it right / You slipped into your darkness, now all that remains / Is my love for you brother, life's still unchanged / To him that threw you away, you ain't nothing but gone / My gypsy biker's coming home\\"    Another indictment of the war: \\"The speculators made their money on the blood you shed\\" and another meaningless death, another faceless number - but not to this group of people. For his friends to ceremonially burn his cycle as they did, the \\"Gypsy Biker\\" must have been a hell of a guy. For me, the image is of a wild kid, a biker, a brother who becomes a straight-laced soldier and comes home in a coffin - the \\"fool's parade\\" (a funeral with military honors)? I wonder if \\"counting white lines\\" at the end of the song references the endless white lines on the road, or the cemetery's endless lines of white crosses? Powerful stuff!    6. GIRLS IN THEIR SUMMER CLOTHES    During the 1988 TOL tour, Bruce often mentioned, \\"The girls in their summer clothes,\\" and any male knows that girls in their summer clothes is one of the best parts of summer. This song has been said to have a \\"Beach Boys\\" feel to it, and that's undeniable. And Springsteen's descriptive, rich lyrics literally transport you to this summer evening in the neighborhood. You remember those summer nights: The bustle, the couples, the breeze, the street lights, the sights and sounds - they come alive here. Springsteen the storyteller has captured those days perfectly.    \\"Kid's rubber ball smacks / off the gutter 'neath the lamp light / big bank clock chimes / off go the sleepy front porch lights\\"    Springsteen's voice is slightly echoed here and the effect works well; it almost feels like an outtake from BORN TO RUN (or DARKNESS)    And what a collection of nods to previous albums! \\"Frankie's\\" diner, \\"Over on the edge of town,\\" \\"Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down\\" and more!    Yeah, the singer has lost his love (or is lamenting the halcyon days of his youth?) and the beautiful babes are passing him by (maybe he's too old for them?) but this song is upbeat and romantic, painting a rich tapestry of a summer evening and its denizens. I think his comments about the girls passing him by are a little wistful, but not too sad. \\"Things been a little tight / But I know they're gonna turn my way.\\" Yeah, he misses the old days (or the girl) but he'll be OK. A GREAT song. Absolutely classic Springsteen; wish there were a few more of these on this album.    7. I''LL WORK FOR YOUR LOVE    The piano fades in... Is that JUNGLELAND? THUNDER ROAD? GROWING UP? Not even close. Unlike those unforgettable classics, this is a \\"cute\\" song packed with religious references to the point of absurdity. It's very hard to take this one seriously, even if it's supposed to be a \\"fun\\" song.    Springsteen has often drawn on his Catholic upbringing for his lyrics, often with great effect. \\"JESUS WAS AN ONLY SON\\" comes to mind as an example of the beauty that Springsteen is capable of when drawing on his Catholic memories. But I'LL WORK FOR YOUR LOVE trades substance for silly, and it's not even \\"good\\" silly. With lines like, \\"Well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones\\" you wonder if this is an homage to the \\"over the top\\" lyrics of oldies like MARY, QUEEN of ARKANSAS, or if someone made a bet that Springsteen couldn't get a dozen Catholic references into this short song. (For the record, he references eleven (by my count) symbols, not to mention that his girl's name is Theresa). The lyrics are ultimately just silly and forgettable; the song is another \\"B-side\\" or \\"TRACKS II candidate.\\" Which is a shame, because when this one starts and you hear the piano, you were hoping for another, well, JUNGLELAND or something, and it's not that at all.    8. MAGIC    Hypnotic. Compelling. Musically, feels like TUNNEL OF LOVE or TOM JOAD. And another song whose meaning is easily missed the first time around. On first listen, the title track almost sounds like a throwaway -- seemingly telling the story of a magician performing simple, trite magic, the kind you might perform for your child: Make the coin disappear, guess the card, find a quarter in your ear. But this haunting song is deeply layered with a much more powerful message: Beware the magicians, the tricksters, the charlatans. The magician distracts you with the right hand while the left hand does the trick. Sound familiar? If it doesn't, turn on the evening news, tune into the press briefings and watch the magicians perform their illusions, while the real story stays hidden.    \\"Trust none of what you hear / and less of what you see.\\" ... \\"I'll cut you in half / While you're smiling' ear to ear / and the freedom that you sought's / Drifting' like a ghost amongst the trees / this is what will be\\"    Backstreets reported that when the tour stopped in Washington DC, \\"Springsteen talked about living in an age where lies can be twisted into truth and vice versa: 'Hey, this is where it happens! This is the City of Magic! '\\"    Like GYPSY BIKER, this one is destined to be a classic.    9. LAST TO DIE    LAST TO DIE, musically, is hard-hitting and sounds a bit like ROULETTE (a TOL B-side). If anyone missed the message of this album, LAST TO DIE screams it. There's no subtly nor nuance here. The setting is obviously Iraq, there's war and chaos everywhere. Springsteen, a supporter of Senator John Kerry, echo's Kerry's words here: \\"We are asking Americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?\\" -- John Kerry, 23 Apr 1971. I don't dislike the song; but maybe this one is just a little TOO in your face, a little TOO obvious. If LAST TO DIE wasn't on an album with many anti-war songs it might be more effective -- but included in a catalog of songs with a similar message, this track almost feels like Springsteen is saying, \\"THIS IS WHAT THIS ALBUM IS ABOUT.\\" A bit too heavy handed; a bit too much, I think. We get it. Iraq War=Mistake.    10. LONG WALK HOME    LONG WALK HOME is a beautiful tune with great lyrics -- a powerhouse that is reminiscent of REAL WORLD from the HUMAN TOUCH album. Like GIRLS IN THEIR SUMMER CLOTHES, it paints very realistic, tangible imagery of a scene - in this case, a man returning to his home town, taking in all the familiar sights - but he recognizes nothing - and he is not recognized.    Springsteen's manager John Landau said, \\"It's sort of the summational song of the album ... I think it's one of Bruce's great masterpieces.\\"    I've read more than one review that said the estrangement the man feels in the town's division on the war, but I think that's reeeealllllyyyy reaching. But certainly there are specific references to America 2007:    \\"You know that flag flying over the courthouse / Means certain things are set in stone / who we are, what we'll do and what we won't\\"    This is Springsteen's obvious reference to how US policies about torture, rendition, wiretapping - the things America would NEVER do - America now does these things. With these lyrics, the song's meaning becomes clear - Springsteen sees familiar America, and it LOOKS the same, but it ISN'T the same at all.    But I think the song is also about wanting to make a connection (RADIO NOWHERE, GIRLS IN THEIR SUMMER CLOTHES and other tracks); it's about a guy who comes back to his hometown and sees all the familiar sites but it's not \\"his\\" town anymore.    I wrote about that when I walked the halls of my grammar school a few years ago (you can read that HERE and I said, \\"You can't go back in time to the home you knew, to the world you knew. People move away, people change, people die. Businesses change. Times change. We change. But you can return to the stage where \\"Home\\" was played out. The players are different, the stage looks different, but so much is the same. Some parts of the stage have been renovated, some have fallen into disrepair. Some of the new players seem friendly, others look scary. But it's their time on the stage. It's their time to make the stage their home.    With either interpretation, or both, this is a GREAT song.    11. DEVIL'S ARCADE    DEVIL'S ARCADE is about an Iraq war casualty, told to us by his lover. He's been wounded in the war, perhaps fatally, and is convalescing in a medical hospital.    It's also the most hypnotic, beautiful song on the album. It's intensely personal, sensual, and compelling. Is he alive? Will he recover? Or is he dead? We're not sure.    She remembers their first fumbling sexual experiences (\\"The rush of your lips, the feel of your name\\") and his enlisting (\\"You said \\"Heroes are needed, so heroes get made\\"\\") and another indictment of the war (\\"Somebody made a bet, somebody paid\\"). Is he dead? Does she talk about the future they'll never share? It's hard to say, the ambiguity is doubtless deliberate, but as the soldier lies in the hospital, she asks him, \\"Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear / House on a quiet street, a home for the brave\\" Promise me there will be a tomorrow. Promise me we can put this darkness behind us.... Is she reassuring him that he will recover? Of bemoaning what they'll never share?    We don't get the answer, just the beautiful, hypnotic wanderings, a bedroom drenched in sunshine, breakfast, and the healing....    \\"The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart    The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart    The beat of your heart, the slow burning away    Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade\\"    The trauma of war, the casualties, the broken dreams, the hope for the future.    Beautiful. Perfect.    12. BROKE THE MOLD    Thematically, DEVIL'S ARCADE is the final track and the additional \\"secret\\" song, BROKE THE MOLD, was a last minute addition to the CD when Springsteen's associate and close friend Terry Magovern passed away on July 30, 2007. Springsteen wrote the song specifically for Terry, and obviously put a lot of love into it. Without knowing the background of the song it would be easy to dismiss lines like, \\"Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the seas / They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if they please\\" as contrived, but the second half of the lyrics is pure gold and will likely be quoted at funerals for years to come: \\"Now your deathis upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth / And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and cursed / But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told / And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold\\"    The track is stripped bare, just harmonica and guitar, and reminds me of MY CITY OF RUINS.    Interestingly (but hardly surprising) the song still fits into the themes of MAGIC (losing a brother or friend, or a way of life, changing times, the loss of war, and remembering a life so different than now). Terry's song also applies to many of the characters we've met on this trip: The gypsy biker, the soldiers, the town folk, and each of us.    Springsteen continues to demonstrate that he is a man of deep feeling. he's also a hell of a songwriter.    MAGIC is a rich tapestry of America 2007, told in Springsteen's definitive style, and is a worthy addition to the catalog of the man who continues to prove it all night.
B000LC51TM|5.0|WHAT A KILLER CD AND DVD! EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT! THE ONLY LITTLE THING I HAVE, IS I WISH THERE WERE ENGLISH SUBTITLES. BUT OTHER THAN THAT. IT IS VERY KILLER.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Fail-Safe (Sidney Lumet, 1964)<br /><br />That Sidney Lumet has traditionally been one of America's finest directors almost goes without saying; this is the man who directed 12 Angry Men, Long Day's Journey into Night, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, Network, and Equus, among many, many others. Fail-Safe came relatively early in his career; while he had done a good deal of television work, it was only his sixth big-screen feature. It takes the tension of 12 Angry Men and ramps it up another couple of notches.<br /><br />The story: a series of mechanical mishaps causes a routine alarm to turn into a potential nuclear catastrophe when a flight of bombers doesn't receive a stand-down signal. With the bombers on their way to deliver a nuclear payload to Moscow, the president (Henry Fonda) gets into a frantic series of impromptu peace talks with the Soviet premier. Meanwhile, we're also given glimpses into the cockpit of the lead bomber, the control room where things went wrong, and a Pentagon war room whose cast have become last-ditch advisors to the President. Their job is somewhat complicated by the presence of a pundit (Walter Matthau) who believes this is the perfect opportunity to launch a strike that would wipe the Soviet Union off the map forever.<br /><br />While it's never explicitly stated, the action seems to take place in real time. This is a tricky trope to pull off (and when it doesn't work, it really bombs, viz. Brian de Palma's Snake Eyes), but Lumet handles it perfectly. As well, Lumet, who is well-known for getting the best out of actors, wrings every last drop from everyone involved here. And there are many-- Fonda, Matthau (as with many comics, put Matthau in a serious role and he gets scary), Dan O'Herlihy, Frank Overton, Fritz Weaver, Larry Hagman, Dom DeLuise, and many others turn in fantastic performances. When filming a suspense movie, though, great performances can only get you so much; the director also has to have a sense of timing. Spend too long in one scene and you kill the pace; speed up too much and you've got an action flick where nothing happens. Lumet keeps it right where it needs to be. And, of course, you need something unforgettable, something that will stick in the viewer's mind for years after they've seen the film (and in 1964, you had to do it within the confines of the \\"we don't have a ratings system, but you'd better be family-friendly\\" atmosphere of Hollywood). Without giving anything away, that's the movie's final scene. You'll never hear a piercing electronic shriek in the same way again. Well, not that you ever heard it much before, but still.<br /><br />It's probably impossible to put together a ranked list of Lumet's major films; you'd have too many tied for first, and Fail-Safe is one of them. **** ½ill the pace; speed up too much and you've got an action flick where nothing happens.

006113399X|5.0|Those who follow mysteries are aware that some of the most intriguing works in that genre have been coming out of Scandinavia in recent years. Not least among these has been the work of Jo Nesbo, who lives in Oslo, Norway. His stories about police detective Harry Hole have garnered high praise. In fact, \\"The Redbreast\\" was voted the best Norwegian crime novel ever written by members of Norwegian book clubs.<  It's easy to see why, literally from the opening moments of the book. The pace is leisurely, but perfectly cadenced. The detail is carefully chosen, the revelations of character and depth drawn in easy strokes. This has to be attributed in part to translator Don Bartlett, but one must assume it was there in the first place.<  The book is set in the present, but its events cover a good deal of time. They go back to World War II, a time when some young Norwegian men willingly fought for Hitler. The plot includes the story of a war hero as well. So out-of-control and alcoholic Hole is plunged into a mystery whose elements reach far and wide.<  Hole is a wonderful, rich creation. And so is the villain in this book.<  \\"The Redbreast\\" is an ambitious book, a mystery, thriller, and serious work of literature combined. The fact that it is highly successful in each of its modes makes it the best thriller of the year - from any country.
B000BZIST4|4.0|The French Connection (William Friedkin, 1971)<br /><br />A quarter century after its release and Oscar win for Best Picture, there's renewed debate over whether William Friedkin's The French Connection is really all that and a bag of horse. And, to be fair, maybe there's a need for some historical context here.<br /><br />1971 was a very, very good year for Ernest Tidyman; he was the singlehanded progenitor of two entire subgenres of film. First his novel Shaft was adapted for film, kicking off the blaxploitation craze, then he got the nod to write the (Oscar-winning) screenplay for The French Connection, which marked the turning point in crime drama from the sanitized, message-based cop flick of the sixties (think In the Heat of the Night for a good example) to the gritty, realistic crime drama of the seventies. While blaxploitation faded out, the tweaks Tidyman made to the crime drama persist to this day.<br /><br />Many of the criticisms levelled at this movie are, in fact, quite valid. The first half is slow; it's almost all setup and no action. It doesn't help matters much that character development in this movie is a seat-of-the-pants kind of thing, and so we don't get a real handle on our characters for a while. Not liking the first half is completely understandable. But then comes the car chase, and everything falls into place. It's been called the best car chase ever filmed (though legions of Bullitt fans, of course, disagree), and it's all the better for Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) chasing not a car, but a train. He doesn't need to worry about following the train; after all, it's on rails. He just has to beat it to the next stop. And in order to do that, he's got to outmaneuver or destroy anything getting in his way. Nowadays, when car chases are measured against the stick of The Blues Brothers, the car chase here seems pretty old hat. But there's still something thrilling about it. Maybe it's the camera work. Maybe it's the fact that Doyle doesn't get through smelling like roses-- both he and the car get pretty banged up. Or maybe it's the fact that he's chasing a train. Whatever it is, it works. After that, once we've got a sense of the characters, Friedkin has a sense of the pace, and there's some action to be had, the movie takes off. It's a rollercoaster ride form there, and it's a ball of fun.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of movies where historical context is necessary to appreciate them (viz. recent review of Breathless), but The French Connection, after a slow start, stands on its own. *** ½s-- both he and the car get pretty banged up.

0440238609|5.0|My Grandson started reading Golden Compass, and I started looking around on the web for the others in the trilogy and came across the dispute as to whether the series was indeed fit for children to read. Both sides of the dispute appeared to me to lack credibility and seemed to be way over sensitive, so I decided to read the series and decide for myself.    My conclusion? Both sides are correct to some extent. Yes, the series is something of a propaganda fusillade against the Roman Catholic Church, but the attacks are actually mostly weak and shallow. The Church's tolerance of religious torture and the story's depiction of that is probably fair, although I am no expert by any means on that. The anti-religion bias in the series is there too, but it is so shallow that it is meaningless to any person knowledgeable of any of the good things religion has brought to civilization.     The entire story is clean, although sometimes quite violent. But, in my estimation it is free of the gratuitous violence present in so many of our movies that the kids like and survive from so easily. Probably no bad dreams.     The story is a basic struggle of good versus evil, and good wins in spades. The setting is so fantastic that it is hard for someone to really imagine that it connects to our world or our current civilization, even though there are a lot of similarities. For example, the supernatural beings in it are essentially nuts, although within the world view. So, it is very easy, if one feels the need to counteract any part of a perceived negative message, that is very easy to do.     The flow of the story is somewhat jerky, but I think that all of the loose ends eventually get cleaned up so that it makes sense. Although, there is something of a change of heart of one character that is really kind of shallow and not well developed.    All in all, it was a fine read, and when over it left me with a feeling of wanting to know more about the future of the main characters. That, tome, is a good thing.
6305078491|3.0|Vampyr: Der Traum des Allan Grey (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1932)<br /><br />Carl Theodor Dreyer is universally considered one of the greatest directors who ever lived, but I'm pretty sure that even his staunchest defenders would admit that his movies are something of an acquired taste. Vampyr is no exception to the rule, a melodramatic potboiler loosely based on a Sheridan LeFanu's Carmilla, but markedly different than any other potboiler-- or any other melodrama-- you're ever likely to see. Dreyer steeped the film in Expressionism-- perhaps more so than any film since Wiene's Der Golem seventeen years before-- and  jettisoned the majority of the plot in order to emphasize atmosphere. (Unfortunately, this worked in 1932 about as well as it works today, and upon its initial release, it was a critical and box-office disaster.)<br /><br />There is a plot to the film, however loose it may be, and it involves Allan Grey (Julian West, the stage name of the film's producer, Nicolas de Gunzburg), who wanders into an old castle whose scion is about to die. He charges Grey, through the bequest of a book, with the protection of his two daughters, whom he believes to be the victims of vampiric depredation. Despite there actually being a plot, though, a good portion of the film is given over to Grey's dreams and odd encounters he has during his stay. It seems to be these, more than the plot, that people remember about the film-- the chap with the scythe waiting for the boat, the burial dream, the disassociated shadow with the wooden leg.<br /><br />If you're coming into this looking for a straightforward horror film, you'll probably wind up disappointed. Nosferatu it is not. It is, however, impossible (even in the godawful American DVD release, with gothic-script subtitles that take up almost a quarter of the screen) to deny that the film does succeed in evoking what it sets out to evoke-- a feeling of disorientation, almost dread. The very plotlessness of large stretches of the film are part of the reason for that, as the viewer's never quite sure what's going on, or whether any given scene will be followed by a scene that would make sense after it. The scenes themselves are constructed with an eye towards the dreamlike state that Grey finds himself in, as well, with Dreyer using primitive, though surprisingly effective, camera tricks (the most famous being shooting some scenes through a thin gauze pad) along with the innate grasp of the power of chiaroscuro that informs all his films.<br /><br />For all this, though, and as much as I admire the film on a technical level, it's not all that watchable. I realize a great deal of this has to do with an awful DVD transfer, and I have high hopes that things will be better when a rumored new transfer appears from Masters of Cinema. But some of what may seem to modern viewers like film stock degradation was quite deliberate on Dreyer's part. I'll admit that maybe it just needs to grow on me; after all, I'm a huge fan of Elias Merhige's grainy 8MM flick Begotten, and Merhige wasn't doing anything Dreyer hadn't done in Vampyr. So I'll reserve final judgment until Masters of Cinema gets the new release out, and just profess cautious optimism. ***for that, as the viewer's never quite sure what's going on, or whether any given scene will be followed by a scene that would make sense after it.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|This is an album best appreciated by the career-long Judas priest fans. Their entire musical career, including the solo years, is presented here. Having done all that, this is who they are now (okay, two years ago, I am a little late). Heavier both musically and physically, they are still the same old rebels, the hell rider who fought the battle for us. They have reunited, not in order to recapture the glory of old days, but to keep pushing forward. And yes, they are the Loch Ness Monster whose glory in its entirety no one has ever seen.         Great statement of who they are.

I especially loved the boxes comparing the words of Jesus to the words of Muhammad. This is an important book to read given the current state of the U.S.

B000FBJF6Y|4.0|Even though some of her cases were a bit predictable I found Precious Ramotswe to be delightful. She commits a series of rookie faux pas, some of which are pretty funny, but she's always honest and humble. She has suffered an abusive early marriage and the death of a premature baby, but she takes it all in stride and is always ready help those in need. She is also a member of a large and largely ignored set of demographics: She is black, over 35, and wears a size 22. Most refreshingly, she doesn't give a crap about dieting and she's not preoccupied with finding a man. She tools around Botswana, and occasionally South Africa, in a small white van.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|These guys are amazing. One of the best live albums ever released. I have to say I was not a fan of Human After All but those songs on this album just make me appreciate them more cause they really rock here!! Definetly buy!!!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I am ecstatic to have it now on DVD. The chemestry between Keaton and Beaty and Nicholson is wonderful to watch and it is also pleasing to see these three when they were at their peak, as well as getting a different viewpoint of recent history. Definately one to curl up on the couch with a glass of wine on a rainy afternoon.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|There is much to love about the quirky little film ONCE: it is honest, simple, transparent, and made with a low budget and lots of love.  The leading characters are gentle people who happen to sing as well as act and the love story they create is a fragile little tale that remains in the air as a nice memory after the credits are past.<br /><br />A Dublin busker (Glen Hansard) is a songwriter and singer who plies his music on the streets when his is not helping his warmly generous father (Bill Hodnett) in his vacuum repair shop: his songs reflect a ruptured love affair and are sensitively poignant.  Along comes a Czech girl (Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;) who sells flowers on the streets but is impressed enough with the lad's music to stop, listen, and even put ten cents in his case.  The two strike up a friendship (the girl plays the piano in a music shop during lunch hour) and in time these two bruised people interact in the wavelength of their love of music.  The lad meets the girl's daughter and mother (Danuse Ktrestova) - the father of the child is still in the Czech Republic -,  they all become friends, and with the help of a few fellow musicians they cut a recording that hopefully will launch the lad's career in a trip to London.  The mood of the extemporaneous feeling piece is one of developing love that can only happen once, especially given the histories of each of the two musicians.<br /><br />Writer/director John Carney demonstrates how a simple story can be made into a touching film for under $150,000. and on a shooting schedule of 17 days.  The featurettes have just as much tenderness in outlining the production of the film as the film itself.  The only problem with the film for this viewer is the music, which seems redundant and repetitive: for those who favor this type of music this will not be a 'flaw'.  It is admirable that films like this are being made, restoring our faith in honest craftsmanship backed by warmth of intent. Grady Harp, December 07
0385259409|5.0|I wish I had discovered Bill Bryson's writing much earlier.  I already have another of his books on order ([[ASIN:0307279464 A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail]]).  Bryson's writing is witty and at times hysterical, as he takes us across the mysterious, engrossing and never ending source of gripping, tragic, tragic-comic, and comic stories that are Australia's history, people, land and unimaginable numbers of flaura and fauna.  He is self-effacing but is willing to \\"efface\\" others when justified, not holding back when his encounters leave something to be desired.    He explores the Australian character via anecdotes of personal experience and history, and gives a comprehensive perspective and understading of this most unusual and mostly ignored continent/country.  If you are interested in a voyeuristic experience that goes beyond the standard American's knowledge about Australia of kangaroos, Steve Irwin and the Bee Gees, and want to be laughing and enthralled at the same time, read this book.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Films that depend heavily on special effects as created by computer generated graphics have never been too interesting for this viewer - and that, of late, covers a lot of territory from the Harry Potter series through the continuous glut of sci-fi films, vampire tales, and apocalyptic epics, etc.  But there is something very different about STARDUST that brings it into a realm of solid storytelling simply enhanced by well-done special effects, and that difference is in the story itself, an unabashed fairy tale populated with wonderful characters played by some of our finest actors.<br /><br />And it all begins with a wall (according to the narrator, Ian McKellen) that separates the real world from an enchanted place and through that wall runs a young lad who starts the frolic.  Flash forward and the child of the runaway lad, Tristan (a magnetically alive Charlie Cox), has groan to maturity and has fallen in love with the beautiful Victoria (Sienna Miller) who demands a star from Tristan to prove his love. The magic begins when that 'star' falls from the sky in the form of Yvaine (Claire Danes, radiant even without the halo that surrounds her).  The foul witch  Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her wicked sisters become aware and plan to cut out the heart of Yvaine in order to gain immortality. The little village is also under the stranglehold of the impending loss of their king (Peter O'Toole) and there is a struggle among the seven sons to ascend the throne: the seventh son Septimus (Mark Strong) defeats his now spirit brothers and sets off to gain the stone that Yvaine wears which will give him immortality.  The on-the-run groups encounter a pirate, Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro in a splendid role), who captures lightening in a marvelous flying ship manned by a swarthy crew.  Of course Tristan and Yvaine become his 'captives', only to discover that the fey closet queen captain is on their side against the forces of evil.  As the film progresses Tristan and Yvaine gradually fall in love, negating their past histories, and the ending is another act of pure magic: evil succumbs to good in the best of fairytale ways.<br /><br />The cast is uniformly excellent, from the true star turns by Pfeiffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox to the secondary roles equally well cast.  The special effects are beautiful and very much in keeping with the story instead of simply breeding monsters to emerge from the bowels of the earth to destroy civilization.  Everyone involved, from the director Matthew Vaughn to the writers Jane Goldman with Vaughn (and of course the creator of the novel Neil Gaiman) to the cast, seem to keep tongue in cheek and appear to be having as much fun as we the audience.  It is a light, exceptionally beautiful fantasy that is pure joy!

0807126063|1.0|I needed an audio book to listen to while commuting, and during the first two disks I was certain I'd found the perfect one:  \\"Confederacy ...\\" was ROFLMAO funny. But by the end of end of disk 3 the antics produced only  smiles, and when it came time to change to disk 5, Ignatius and most of the other characters were either so annoying or so over-the-top that I didn't care what happened to any of them.    One positive:  the narrator of the audio version, Barrett Whitener, is superb.  He must have created 15-20 different voices, each was unique and  ideally suited for the character's personality, especially Ignatius'.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|This story is set in London, where an evil chancellor is head of an oppressive government that rounds up anyone that is different, and uses them as guinea pigs for their biological warfare experiments. There is a fire, and the resettlement camp burns to the ground. One inmate survives, our hero V, who appears to have taken his name from his cell door, which bears the Roman numeral for five, which is \\"V\\". He now has a vendetta to kill all the high ranking officials that orchestrated the prison and the experiments on the inmates.<br /><br />The government does create a biological weapon from the program, but instead of using it on the enemy they unleash it on their own citizens to create panic, so that they can have more laws and enforcers.<br /><br />Due to the fire, V is horribly scared, and dons a Guy Fawkes costume including mask, wig and cape. It's creepy but powerful. Guy Fawkes was also a revolutionary who tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up parliament. Guy Fawkes day, November 5th, is a theme throughout the movie.<br /><br />V meets our heroine, Evey when he saves her from an evil curfew enforcer. Her life is never the same.<br /><br />He hijacks a TV station, and gives one of the most moving speeches I've ever heard. His theme is the government should be afraid of it's people, the people shouldn't be afraid of the government. He succeeds in blowing up a building and killing everyone on his list. The government then makes up stories to cover up his actions. He does some really bad things, even to Evey. But in the end, he has an impact on the whole country, as they finally stand up in mass against the government.<br /><br />It is an excellent and powerful movie that reminds us that we must fight to keep our freedoms because the government does not always have our best interest in mind, and what they tell us isn't always the truth.
B000E8N690|5.0|Joaquin should have been the one to receive the award on this movie. He is terrific as Johnny Cash. He is believeable and wears the Johnny Cash personality, carries himself off as Johnny and even sounds like him. His protrayal of Johnny's life and the struggles he had through life, were shown in such an authentic way. We see JR (Johnny Cash's nickname as a youngster) live a life no one should have to live as a child growing up. His father shows no qualms about the fact that he wishes JR had died, and not the older son. JR loved his brother and lives forever with the haunting fact that his father will never love him. Even later in life, the father proves to be a bitter man for many years, until life comes to terms for Johnny after he marries June Carter. The Carter family prove that love and understanding of others, even when most people give up on them, can conquer all. Wisdom, compassion and goodness flows from the Mother and Dad Carter, and you can't help but wish to have known them personally in your own life. Joaquin does a marvelous job in this movie. It is a truly moving and terrific movie. Especially if you are a fan of Country/Western, but even if you are not, you will find it to be funny, serious, emotional and touching. A must see and a real keeper.

No longer do I have to suffer through the \\"bonus footage\\" re-added for the network TV premiere and every previous consumer media release, which only serve to validate my belief that there is a reason that films have editors.<br /><br />I couldn't sell my old versions fast enough.<br /><br />If you like the added footage, it's got that version too. Very nice packaging job as well.<br /><br />And I haven't even gotten into the other bonus material, I'm having such a blast re-living my original theatrical experience!

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT! It is such a good representation of life in the 60's and brought back so many memories (yes, I even remember some of them.) My daughter, who's 19, even loved it without \\"getting\\" all the references (in fact, she thought I was putting way too much meaning into the movie.) We both went home and downloaded the soundtrack from iTunes. I could watch it over and over. And if you watch it and don't get it, read up on \\"Across the Universe\\" on Wikipedia.

0553208845|4.0|I read this book for book group.  Prior to reading Siddartha, I had not read any Herman Hesse books so I was intrigued to read it, especially with all the great reviews.<br /><br />It is a short book - only about 118 pages - one that you want to take your time with if you can.<br /><br />The book is about Siddartha, as a boy he longs to learn, discover and find \\"the path of the paths\\".  His philosphy is that he has to learn it on his own, it is not something that can be taught.  We watch as Siddartha comes to this conculsion after years of teaching, we see him set out on his own, stumble, rediscover what is important to him, and then eventually find what he is looking for.<br /><br />Since it is only my first time having read this book I feel as if I only brushed the surface.  I would say that the lessons learned are basic lessons that most people realize but it's good to be reminded of them.  I'm sure if I continue to re-read this book over the course of my life I'll take different lessons from it each time that I read it.  I found it to be a very peaceful read.
B00000K2W1|5.0|An excellent collection, Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits features the radio tunes immortalized by the  \\"white woman who could sing the blues\\", Janis Joplin. Included are the tracks Piece of My Heart, Mercedes Benz, Summertime, and the excellent Me and Bobby McGee, which would be Janis' only #1 hit and was, sadly enough, posthumously recorded as such.    In this disc, Joplin's unique vocals are enough to convince one that Janis was and is a one-of-a-kind performer who cannot be equaled or imitated. To this day, no one has filmed an adequate biopic of Janis Joplin as played by someone else. In fact, that \\"played by someone else\\" will probably never occur since no one possessing similarities to what were Janis' physical traits has the matching dynamic voice.    If you like this disc and want more of Janis, I suggest that you purchase Cheap Thrills (the album with the Robert Crumb-like comic book art on the cover) and Pearl, her very last release. Altogether, they will make a more complete collection than The Essential Janis Joplin, which, itself, consists of a very nice Janis repertoire.    In one sense, Janis is no longer with us, and yet, considering the magnitude of her accomplishments in those brief 27 years, Janis will always be with us with a spirit that will live on!
B000WZAE1I|1.0|The short of it:  Be prepared for frustration with image quality and audio issues if you do not have a new high end player and a surround sound system.<br /><br />I loved the movie; we saw it twice in the theater.  I eagerly anticipated the release of the DVD and planned to give several copies as gifts.  On 18 December I bought two copies.  On 19 December I played the DVD.  The enchantment evaporated.  The recording's problems appeared on both purchased copies.<br /><br />First I had problems with the image.  As scenes cut from one to the next the image became heavily pixilated.  At times the screen went blank.  At times control reverted to the DVD player as if the disc were absent.  Thinking that I may have purchased a randomly bad disc I opened the second DVD (originally intended as a gift).  It had EXACTLY the same problems.<br /><br />Being I had watched two discs of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" two days earlier the player itself did not seem to be the problem.  Still, I connected another player and tried again.  Exactly the same issues appeared.  Finally, a third DVD player successfully played the discs.<br /><br />Conclusion 1:  The video is very tetchy.  Only my newest player worked satisfactorily.  Being other recently acquired movie discs continue to work successfully in all three players I must conclude that the recording needs help (perhaps some copy protection scheme run amok?).<br /><br />So finally the movie was running.  I quickly discovered that the audio is unsatisfactory.  The decibel level was all over the map.  On minute I was turning the volume up to hear a nearly inaudible conversation, and the next I was turning it down as the noises of music and effects blasted the room.  Conversations were frequently unintelligible because of what should have been background sound (and no amount of volume up/volume down can compensate for that problem).  I searched the menu for sound options, but I could not locate an appropriate solution.<br /><br />Conclusion 2:  \\"Surround sound\\" is nice in a theater but at least for this recording it really does not work well coming from a single speaker on a TV set.<br /><br />Recommendation:  If you don't have above an average video and audio system and are unwilling to invest in one just to watch this movie then don't bother buying this recording.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"They\\" will fix these shortcomings in the future.  I hope so.  Until then I'm looking for a gift that won't embarrass me when I give it to friends.Surround sound\\" is nice in a theater but at least for this recording it really does not work well coming from a single speaker on a TV set.<br /><br />Recommendation:  If you don't have above an average video and audio system and are unwilling to invest in one just to watch this movie then don't bother buying this recording.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"They\\" will fix these shortcomings in the future.

B000Y179KO|3.0|The album is worth owning, but don't buy it expecting the Eagles of the '70s. Perhaps they're still playing the soundtrack for the freeway, except now it's 2007 and they're perpetually stuck on the 405 during rush hour, and can't pass 15 mph to save their skin.
B00008S2VG|4.0|this is known as madonna's worst cd. but it is only really unsuccesful in terms of sales. as a cd of pop music, it is actually quite good. unfortunately, with most madonna cds, they release the best songs as singles. in this case, they released the weakest songs. if you take out the silly \\"american life\\" and the hard-to-swallow \\"hollywood\\" (not to mention \\"i'm so stupid\\") you are left with a very solid cd. \\"die another day\\" is an excellent-sounding song with remarkably meaningful lyrics for a soundtrack cut. \\"mother and father\\", \\"nobody knows me\\", \\"love profusion\\" and \\"xstatic process\\" are all catchy, meaningful songs. my only real complaints for the cd are that 1.) there doesn't seem to be a focus for the cd. madonna may have tried to do too much (make too many \\"statements\\", try rapping, play guitar, etc.).  2.) the co-producer steered madonna toward a \\"folk\\", acoustic-sounding cd (but the music and lyrics are strong enough that had the more-dance/electronic-sounding remixes of ALL of these songs been released instead, this could have been one of madonna's best and most successful cds.) the production makes the album stand out as an oddity in madonna's catalog. but if anything, isn't it good that an artist who has been around for so long takes chances and tries new things, even knowing she might stumble, rather than recyling the same old sound and formula over and over again. clearly, the type of \\"success\\" madonna is striving for here is something very different for her. and, for the most part, she does succeed. it's not perfect, but there is beauty in her imperfection.
B000028U0Y|5.0|I've never been big on country music, so I was skeptical about this. All doubts had disappeared by track 4 or 5.<br /><br />What a great album! The music holds up on its own, and while its technically simplistic and formulaic (the guitars are all palm-muted cross picking with a IV-I-IV-I bass line) there's a passion and energy to it that somehow rings true. Johnny also has a fantastic speaking voice, and his \\"singing\\" is more of a \\"melodic spoken word\\" that was especially effective.<br /><br />On its own, I'd probably give this album 4 stars, but what pushes it into 5-star classic territory is the setting: live at Folsum Prison. It's certainly a surreal listening experience, hearing all those hardened cons cheering at the \\"wrong\\" moments and the warden making announcements between songs. Johnny has a great rapport with the audience, and the set list--all about jail, murder, etc.--clearly spoke to their hearts. It's hard not to get caught up in their enthusiasm.<br /><br />If you own only one country album, this is the one to have.
0142501123|5.0|\\"Room on the Broom\\" by Julia Donaldson is such an awesome book. My son got it when he was four. We have read it so many times that I couldn't even count. Then a couple of months ago, our original copy was involved in a spill-related accident. There was no question that we would replace it.  He would have missed it so much!!     The rhymes are inventive and funny, and the illustrations are absolutely wonderful.  I do believe that any child would enjoy this book.

B000Y1ZXU2|5.0|I want to smite the ungrateful Philistines who are so eager to dismiss this treasure trove as nothing more than a half a** rehash ripoff. If you want live footage go to their concerts or watch youtube. Let's get to the good stuff...  Packaging-Magic Eye lenses like on 10,000 days CD, 5 back to back 3D image cards (so 10 pics[not of the band]) which stand up in a slot w/in the case. \\"Woopdeedoo\\" you say. Well who else does this? Yes it takes some work but it's fun. Yes it takes focus but it's rewarding.  DVD-Video shows Adam's tenacious genius. Prepare to ask the screen \\"what the h***?\\" numerous times. Is it random madness? It would be easy to dismiss it as such. It is revealed in the documentary that nothing could be further from the truth. This video is a work of art set to music. It is not a music video. It can not, nor should it be, viewed once.  DVD-Documentary will show you more of Adam Jones' than has ever been revealed to fans before. There are photo's of his many sculpture's which inspired the Opiate & Undertow covers, his major motion picture works, personal works never before seen, pics of other band members away from their instruments, etc. There are interviews with people who have worked with and known Adam for many years. There are interviewers w/ the CGI masters who wielded and welded this work meticulously for many months. All in all I was very suprised that so much was revealed, from so many different people, and from so many different angles.   DVD-Commentary was spontaneous and hilarious like only David Cross knows how to be. Look him up on imdb.com. He gives two seperate satires on the video.   DVD-Chapel of Sacred Mirrors with Alex Grey was a real special treat for those who love and appreciate the psychadelic surreal artwork found in TOOL's last two albums. Alex Grey's book of art Transfigurations will open and blow your mind. This special feature on the dvd takes you into his chapel/gallery in New York.   Price-$10 new! IMO they could've and should've charged more for this. A bootleg, a watch or two at a friend's house, a clip on youtube isn't gonna cut it here. This is worth owning folks.

075640407X|5.0|I loved this book so much I wish I could give more than 5 stars. I've read a lot of books this year and this one is the best of all.  I've been reading fantasy, sci-fi, horror and mystery for many, many years and I've read lots of good really ones, but this one stands front and center and I wait anxiously for the next installment.

B000P7V45S|3.0|First let me say, that Trick of the Tail is a wonderful album and has been a long-time favorite of mine.  My comments are focused on the remaster and how it sounded to me.<br /><br />While I suppose on a technical level this remaster brings more clarity and crispness to parts of the songs that you may have never noticed on your old LP or earlier CD, I found it almost excruciating to listen to some of the tracks.  I am not a technocrat, so I will leave those reviews for others - but as a long time fan of Genesis, I have to say this remaster is tough to listen to.  It sounds to me as if more attention was given to bringing out the previous hidden or overshadowed aspects of the original recording in equal measure while neglecting the overall sound and feel of the original songs.  The bass sounds dull and thudding and the vocals sound tinny -- at least on the CD version, the richness and overall depth is lacking with the mid-range overshadowed, creating a lack of balance.  And were those cymbals really that loud on the original -- they make my teeth hurt ;-0.  It seems like the engineers were trying to give this a more 'poppish' sound like the Phil Collins' recordings a la We Can't Dance.<br /><br />Bottom line for this long-time Genesis fan:  very disappointing.<br /><br />caveat:  when I get my surround sound system - I'll give the DVD a try and hope for better!

038572179X|4.0|I was completely captivated by the first part of the book. The  imagery, the inner thoughts were some of the best writting I  have experienced in quite a while. Even though I could maybe see  where the story was going, it was not predictable. There were  many surprises.    The Second part was also very good, but I wasn't sure how it related  to the main plot at first.    The third part started the downhill trend.     I thought the epilog was going to be bad, but after some reflection   it made a few good points that I thought about for the next few  days. I really did feel a longing for the way things weere back in the early part of the story.    There is a lot of food for thought here. A simple read is not sufficient.    Great book!
B0000057C5|5.0|Okay now let me explain. Lots of people see something like that and say 'Geese, obsessed fan.' But, when you think about it, Rammstein has shown that their skills as both musicians and lyricists surpasses many others. They show throughout this album (and I suppose all the other ones, too) that they've mastered their instruments. Flawless playing, amazing rythms heavy enough to satisfy any metal fan, synthesizers playing in on songs like Spiel mit mir that are quite eerie enough to satisfy goth fans, or whoever enjoys eerie...    Now, I'm  fan of bands like Gojira and Dreamtheater, and they obviously show their mucianship very time they play, but in the realm of songwriting, the skills are a tad lacking. Rythm seems a little off, as if lacking an overall sound in most places. Rammstein may not throw in endless Megadeth-ish guitar soloes, but their songs are structured.     And, for those who really care about what their saying, Rammstein is great band. They manage to fill songs with romance, sorrow, irony, and anger not only through their instrumental playing but through the words, which seems like the easiest task in music. But whens the last time you turned on the radio and a song emotional connected to you? When listening to Sehnsucht, you may come to relate to Till as he sings of longing.    So for people who want to find peoticism, the musicianship

B000OVLNII|4.0|The philosopher George Santayama is credited with penning the phrase; \\"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\"  Historians have adopted this phrase and sharpened it to suite; \\"Those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it.\\"  Team of Rivals, not only documents, but also enlivens our insights about Lincoln's Civil War Administration.  It indeed encourages us to study this history.       There are in existence today over 2000 separate books, studies, and essays, about the American Civil War.  The volumes are devoted to the battles, battlefields, generals, munitions, and detailed descriptions of supplies replete down to the individual General's shoe sizes.  The viewpoints abound.  We experience the war through the eyes of the commanders in the field as well has the bravehearts entrenched in the soil of their homeland, on both sides of the line.  We share the heartbreak and terror of the civilians as they bear witness to the destruction of their homeland and loss of their kindred.  Many a learned academic institution has assembled a library focusing on American government in the 19th century.  Cresting the collection are numerous titles devoted to the civil wars years.  Doris Kearns Goodwin has provided the focal point of that crest with, \\"Team of Rivals.\\" We are guided to witness Lincoln at the helm of the American Ship of State, armed to the bulwarks with an abounding munitions magazine.  Lincoln guides the fledgling vessel to follow his planned course.  The crew; his team of rivals, face threats from both sides, as he steers the nation into its troubled policitical harbor.  The team rallies to the threat, heading to the inevitable showdown - war!     Kearns Goodwin the architect builds our foundation for understanding the era, by providing the necessary informational blocks needed to best support the views and philosophy of that political theater.  A clear picture is painted. The canvass reveals the abolitionist's holy cause, the growing territory's ambitious struggle for statehood, the northern business coup's deep-pocketed financial interest, and an insistent southern society's call for the expulsion of Yankee mores from their homeland.  The chief issue, which the executive branch has managed to dance around the last forty or so years, is the deep political unrest of the southern states and their growing urgency for secession.    The author then introduces a young Lincoln.  A rather unique country boy and a distant relation to Daniel Boone, whose every decision and fortune in life guide him to the presidency.  A man, who would quote Shakespeare, in the presidential suite to drive home a political position, then recollects a humorous tale to break the solemn air permeating the room.    The biographer now exercises her talents on William H.Seward.  Seward, Lincoln choice for Secretary of State, parades his accomplishments before the republican conventioneers: Governor of New York, adroit public official and orator.  Newspaper editors across the North predict Seward as the sure winner of the newly formed Republican Party's first Presidential convention.  Seward, who first considered Lincoln a Podunk, now, saw the opportunity as Secy of State to be the power behind the throne.  Seward soon realized the Lincoln genius, came to vigorously campaign for his election to a second term, and wept uncontrollably at the President's death.  Lincoln chose Salmon P. Chase for his Secretary of the Treasury.  Chase, with his vast business connections, proved to be the banker extraordinaire for a wartime government.  Lincoln suffered through Chase's ever-persistent self-promotion for the presidency.   Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton was Lincoln's hammer.  The Secretary's work ethic was unmatched only to Lincoln's remarkable talents.    During the war, the writ of Habeas Corpus was suspended.  The Union needed a superior inspector, a worthy keeper of the rule of law.  Lincoln could find no better individual tocarry this judicious load than Edward Bates, his Attorney General.   Lincoln's cabinet, the Team of Rivals, were nurtured, listened too, charmed, scowled and praised by the President as he tapped the talents of each of his team members  Ms. Goodwin now unfolds the wisdom and genus of Lincoln.  The author places the reader within the White House walls, to experience first hand the details of Lincoln's administration.  We are seated in Lincoln's upstairs office to witness the masterful managerial talent of this once thought of backwoodsman.  This reader many times would pause, reflect on the dire situations presenting themselves to the president, then smile and revere in the originally and near perfection of the president solution.  We ride with the President as he visits the troops at the front.  Warmth and affection were the gifts Lincoln brought to the infantryman, whose battle worn psyche rests on a canvas bed.  The soldier looking up in awe towards the awkward equestrian returns with an emotionally energized hand salute.  The President nods with moist eyes.  This is a portrait of Abe Lincoln, the man, fulfilling the duties of Abe Lincoln the President.    The first wise decision every president-elect could make, would be to study President Lincoln's administrative tactics and the reasoning behind his decisions.  I would go so far as to recommend that leaders of large corporation do the same.  The qualities Abe Lincoln possessed long before he sought public office, empathy, humility and of course the banner which he so earnestly deserved - Honest Abe, were the engines that drove his greatness.   As Secretary Stanton proclaimed at Lincoln's passing, \\"Now he belongs to the ages.\\"  So too now this Pulitzer Prize winning volume belongs to the citizens of the world, to learn, cherish and measure the ever-changing development of this grand experiment called; The United States of America.

1558908846|4.0|Science fiction is such a wonderful medium in that it affords the creative community to test our concepts that would be impossible to explore in real life.<br /><br />Judge Dredd is precisely that.  A future post-apocalypic Earth (The Cursed Earth) where humanity lives in megacities and where society in order to keep order has established a Police Force with a Judges Power (Police, Judge, Jury, Executioner rolled up into one person - The Judge).  These Judges have the power to chase criminals and dispense \\"Justice\\" on the spot.  A Judge witnesses you jaywalking and he can, on the spot, Judge you guilty and impose a fine.  In our society, such a concept is ridiculous and would never work but...suspend disbelief and take a look at what qualities a Judge would have to possess from an Ethics and Justice Perspective.  Sometimes these concepts start out in Comics and Judge Dredd is no exception -- Judge Dredd is an award winning and very long running Britsh Comic.  I've never read it though fyi.<br /><br />The Movie is about one Judge -- the baddest and most feared/respected of them all (Judge Joseph Dredd).  The movie adaptation follows the formula for many action movies of this time.  Rob Schneider plays comic relif (small time thief who happens to be in the wrong time) throughout the movie.  Diane Lane is the young new Judgette (sp?) and love interest of Stallone (no romance in the movie though just a bit of URST). Diane is as always lovely and such a wonderful acress. Stallone plays the cold idealistic Ethical Super Judge Dredd.  Armand Assante plays a wonderful villain with a very cool bad Robot bodyguard.  Max von Sydow and J&uuml;rgen Prochnow also play some wonderful supporting characters who deliver some wonderful performances.  The acting is first rate and I can say that only Stallone could have played this role -- almost as if it was written for him.<br /><br />I won't give away much of the plot - suffice it to say that Judge Dredd is accused of a crime he didn't commit, gets shipped off to jail and the bad guys almost take over.  As Stallone, Schneider, Lane, and Max von Sydow work to fix things and come back from the edge of oblivion there's plenty of action, humor, big guns, big guns, shooting, big guns etc.  Stallone saves the day and kisses the girl.<br /><br />Genre:  SciFi<br />Type:  Action<br />Category:  A (this is not a B movie)<br />Budget:  Summer Blockbuster ($90million)<br />Actors:  First Rate<br />Acting:  Very Good<br />Special Effects: First Rate (for the time -- still good today)<br />How'd it do:  Half Belly Flop ($100million worldwide)<br /><br />This was a big budget film which received poor reviews.  It was very formulaic and probably the critics were tired of the same formula being used....Big Tough Hero + Comic Relief Funnyman + Gorgeous Girl + Super Bad Guy + Super Tough Odds + Science Fiction Setting = Super Summer Bockbuster.<br /><br />In fairness, the movie is a bit dated but if you enjoy this genre and want a fun movie to watch on a Sunday Afternoon in the SciFi action category - this is a good candidate.  Its not a thinking person's movie (unless your roomate happens to be a philosophy PHD candidate in which case you'll go down having the classic Socrates and Thrasymacus debate for the rest of the afternoon).

B000065BPB|5.0|I work in an office area which seems to amplify any sounds that people make, so I bought this headphone set. The noise cancelling quality is just OK without music playing.  Once the music is playing, people have to tap me on the shoulder to get my attention (and I don't play my music loud).  The 'Out Of the Box' sound is just OK.  Once I adjusted my equalizer, the sound quality was excellent.  The curly cord has one advantage: my old headphones had a long straight cord and my office chair would frequently roll over the cord and I would have to roll my chair back over it to get the cord untangled; the curly cord does not cause this problem for me and it expands quite a bit to allow me to move from one end of my desk to the other.  Overall, I am glad I bought these headphones and I would recommend them to anyone.
B000K15VSA|5.0|What can I say? The wait was well worth it. It's taken over 25 years for this movie to be released on DVD since it came out in the theaters and this release does not disappoint in the least.<br /><br />First off, the V-K case is great. It's made of a very sturdy plastic and is not flimsy at all. Just carrying it you can feel the weight of all that is included with this set which is great. There are two push buttons that unlock the case and it opens up. In the lid is a dossier folder containing various rare art prints for many scenes in the movie. There is also a motion film clip picture containing a scene from the movie.<br /><br />In the bottom part of the case placed into cut-out foam is the 5-disc movie box containing 5 DVDs and a booklet, a spinner replica and a plastic origami unicorn.<br /><br />The 5 discs contain over 9 hours of film and features. None of them disappoint and they are all worth their weight in gold.<br /><br />Disc 1 is the Final Cut. This is the definitive version of the movie. No voice-over, restored picture which looks wonderful and vibrant and other touch ups that do not destroy the integrity of the movie. Some of the \\"changes\\" include cables that were attached to the spinners for a crane have been digitally removed; dialog and lip synchronization has been fixed during the scene with the snake dealer; digitally put Joanna Cassidy's head on the stunt double's body during the windows stunt scene and many other minor fixes that do nothing but enhance the movie. No replacing of special effects since they don't need it.<br /><br />Disc 2 contains a three-and-a-half hour feature called Dangerous Days that goes through the entire life of the movie from concept to release. This has to be the most complete \\"making of\\" feature I've seen since the release of the extended editions of the LOTR movies. Just wonderful to watch and interesting.<br /><br />Disc 3 contains the US theatrical, European theatrical (which is the common VHS version) and the '92 Director's Cut, all seamlessly branched together and each one has a introduction by Ridley.<br /><br />Disc 4 contains a lot more background information about the movie and Phillip K. Dick. The interviews are with people not associated with the movie as well as people that were behind the scenes. One featurette that was very interesting was the comparison between the book and the movie. There are also original making of features from 1982 when the movie was ready for release. Nostalgic and very interesting to watch!<br /><br />Disc 5 contains the work print version that was shown as the preview before the movie came out. The Final Cut is very similar to this one but there is a different beginning, some scenes shortened and some different music. It's about 7 minutes shorter than the Final Cut but it's a nostalgic piece of history that some have never been able to see and now you have the chance. The sound and picture aren't bad but they could only touch it up so much. It's very watchable and it's interesting to see how Ridley initially released the movie to the public to preview.<br /><br />Also included on the fifth disc is a 30-minute feature that shows how the various versions of the film came to be and how the Final Cut was finally created.<br /><br />For collectors, this is the movie set to get. If you are a true Blade Runner fan, there is no other option. Definitely the best DVD collection set I've seen yet.er and each one has a introduction by Ridley.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|These DVD's are great. But the rerecorded opening music stinks. That's why I only gave it a 4. It simply wasn't necessary to redo it. The original track could have been remastered just like they do any other music. I'm glad they included Goodnight Sweetheart in the classic City On The Edge Of Forever. I've been trying for years to find out who's singing. Sounds like Rudy Vallee but I can't find where he ever recorded it. Anybody know who is singing? Thanks
0792165020|5.0|This film - like the others directed by the brilliant Anthony Minghella - manages yet again to crawl under one's skin of comfort, and creates brooding emotions of empathy and revolt.<br /><br />Tom Ripley - like most of the others - is a very complex character: the idealist genius with the non-ideal background, yearning for more. As a simple lie pulls him into the world of the rich and glamorous, he finds himself trapped by the intoxication of this faux success, as he mentioned to his lover with tears streaming from his anguished face: it's better to be a fake somebody, than a real nobody. It eventually leads to murder upon murder, as Tom cannot escape his yearning for acknowledgement.<br /><br />Matt Damon portays Mr. Ripley beautifully as he quietly 'dies' behind a mask of happiness. The supporting cast is excellent, and the boat-scene between Damon and Law being grippingly brilliant.<br /><br />Yet again - choosing his old time favourite - Minghella chooses Gabriel Yared to score the film, and it finishes off 'Mr. Ripley' with emotional style.<br /><br />Although not an easy film to watch, it remains one of my favourites.
B000O77V4W|4.0|The show was fun and exciting, but the dvd offers a whole different insight into JT's personality and the group he performs with.  It's great to watch the show all over again (and again, and again) but the interviews and showbiz insights are even more worth the money.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This is a film that obviously divides people enormously. It is not hard to see why. In common with earlier STAR WARS films, it is a mix of similar ingredients: the profound, the comic, the noble, the villainous, the familiar, the alien, combined with newly developed action sequences that would have been impossible before CGI, which George Lucas had an enormous role in creating. The problem is that, although these elements are all present, they are not blended in satisfying proportions. Very serious subjects from slavery to ruminations with messianic overtones take a back seat to broad slapstick and often crude cartoonish comedy geared toward children. Yet, the more interesting thematic or complex plot elements--however scattered they are--would be unintelligible to children, so it's impossible to determine what the target audience was.<br /><br />Because the tone of PHANTOM MENACE is impossible to gauge--scenes of potential gravity suddenly interrupted by the cheapest gags, it is ultimately unsatisfying. It also is very difficult to see how it fits in the STAR WARS saga in general. The chance meeting with a very young child named Anakin linking it with the story is treated as a subplot, and should have been dealt with in a much more inspired fashion; it should have been the core of the film or even been edited with ATTACK OF THE CLONES into a single film (CLONES  would need heavy editing, but it does anyway). Because PHANTOM MENACE is a separate film, much of the action that unfolds in the next installment has no basis or normal chronological continuity. In PHANTOM MENACE, for example, Anakin and Padme are separated by almost a generation, Padme being closer to the age of Anakin's mother than the boy. So of course there is no romantic hint here. Yet in the next episode, the age distinction seems to be lowered to no more than four or five years, and Anakin reveals that he has been in love with Padme since their first meeting. Pre-pubescnet kids don't think about much-older persons in these terms so it can't be the same Anakin, and seems to refer to a film that doesn't exist. In PHANTOM MENACE, the child Anakin merely asks if Padme is an \\"angel,\\" partly wishing that she is, of course, so she can rescue his mother and him from enslavement.<br /><br />PHANTOM MENACE thus seems to stand on its own, which must certainly not have been the intent. It is clear that despite claims to the contrary, Lucas never had all of this worked out; it must only have been a very rough outline he had been mulling over. He was apparently not concerned about the details that he set in motion during the initial three films. Now it is Qui-Gon who is Obi-Wan's mentor, not Yoda, as was stated countless times in the original films. Now the Force is not \\"something which surrounds us and binds the universe together\\" as Alec Guiness' Obi-Wan told us in the first film (1977)--a very Eastern concept; it is, rather, a genetic quirk resulting from an overabundance of \\"midi-chlorians\\" in the blood. The Jedi thus are no longer beings of great spiritual nobility so much as the result of chromosomal \\"superiority\\"--uncomfortably reminiscent of crackpot early 20th-century eugenics used to claim the superiority of whites over other races or Aryans over Semites (Hitler's version). It saps STAR WARS of its mythic status. It is a relief that at least the \\"midi-chlorian\\" eugenics are dropped in Episode II.<br /><br />Overall, the few deeper ideas are entirely overwhelmed by CG special effects, the troubling demystification, and silly comedy suitable for kids' TV, most notably personified by the CGI character of Jar Jar Binks, an annoying, accident-prone \\"Gungan\\" who uses language in ways reminiscent of racist African-American stereotypes from the 1930s. One has to wonder how Mr. Lucas missed the latter appalling problem, or worse, if he intended it. A few minutes of Jar Jar's irritating antics would be more than enough to spoil any scene, but his unrelenting presence in every nearly every for over two hours sours anything of interest. The film has a few moments of intensity and even emotion here and there, but they are limited and eclipsed by the rest of the action; with plot and treatment so spotty, the film must be considered a failure.two hours sours anything of interest.

1594489505|3.0|First of all, let me make clear, I loved the kite runner, I literally could not put it down, thus i could not wait for his next book.  It's not that this book is not well written and does not feel at times similar to the kite runner, its just that it's so dark, frankly it is one of the most depressing books i have ever read, and when something happens to one of the main characters in the middle of the book, I literally threw the book across the room, I was like..how depressing and dark can one book get, and even as the ending neared and things can to light that i didnt expect, I just still could not shake off..the pages and pages of the deepest despare, the book is almost sadistic in its continued darkness and cruelty to its main characters, I understand living in Afganistan is bleak, but do I have to read about it page after page after page, every hope dashed, every goodness darkened and every laugh silenced, i felt suffocated as i read this book, like i was in a dark place with no escape, part of this is Hosseini's fantastic writing and what he intended, but it really dones make for a good read like the Kite Runner, the unrelenting darkness of this book, poisons the content and after awhile, I just wanted to close the book and not pick it up again, the ongoing dispare is just too trucated, it goes on too long and the cruelty is just never ending, I give this book three stars because it really is good writing and its a book worth reading, but darkness is one thing..hopeless, endless dispare is another.  I recommend this book, but be forewarned it is about the darkest and most depressing books i have ever read.
B00004VVND|4.0|I remember seeing many ads on TV for WESTWORLD when I was a kid growing up in the '70's but never got around to watching the film until today.  The premise is still intriguing.  Three expensive theme parks - Medieval, Roman and Old West - have been created for upscale adults to fulfill ALL their fantasies and the resort is almost totally staffed by androids.  These very lifelike androids can only be distinguished from humans by a look at the underside of their hands.  Guests are reassured \\"nothing can go wrong\\" and everything is closely monitored by techies wearing ties and white coats in the lab.     The film mostly focuses on the old west theme park where two friends played by the very 70's looking James Brolin and Richard Benjamin arrive for a vacation.  Brolin's character has visited before and is confident about the pleasures WESTWORLD has to offer and Benjamin playing a recently divorced man soon relaxes and joins in the fun.  Then something begins to go wrong as the android workers revolt against the humans.      The most memorable element of WESTWORLD is Yul Brynner as the robotic gunslinger relentlessly out of control and truly horrifying. The movie does have a few plot holes as well as quite a few untied loose ends.  I would have shortened  the action/chase scenes as well.  Despite these little flaws this is a very entertaining movie that should please a wide audience.  One caution though rated PG it doubtless would be rated PG-13 if it had been released for the first time today.
B000H305U0|1.0|I can't believe anyone would take this junk seriously. The 'music' is so inept, clueless & boring it's inconceivable that anyone with an IQ over 5 would like this. This goes to show you the power of marketing & how true it is that there's a sucker born every minute. This guy 'sexy' ? He looks & sounds like a brain damaged troll. I've seen better looking poo.       I give it -10 stars.

B000H8SFMK|4.0|Wonderful remastering job by Rhino.   The bonus cuts are all worthy, no fillers here !   All the reissues have lyrics included, except for the bonus cuts.     If you don't know the Pogues, they sound like a traditional Irish band, but with a rock n roll beat & streetwise attitude. The songs are mostly dark, about life, death, getting drunk and everything in between.   What a band! Whether a slow & moody ballad or a raving party tune, the Pogues are premier musicians. This cd & Hell's Ditch are my faves, but   they are all worth getting.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|Before I begin, let me say right off the bat that there are only 3 real James Bond's in my view and that's Sean Connery, Roger Moore and Pierce Bronson. That being said, Daniel Craig has potential.    This film is very good. If you forget that its a Bond movie, then you might think it was excellent. Very good pacing between the action and the slow parts.     Word of warning, there is a very disturbing torture scene in this film. If you are squeemish, then you might want to skip that part (especially if you are a man)!    As for the DVD production, it played very well in my player. Not much in the way of extras though. Still, if you are a fan of James Bond or just good spy action films, then this one is for you. See how James Bond became the man we've come to know for over 40 years.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|I enjoyed the first two Bourne films. A violent, intelligent, multi-talented character who doesn't remember his past or who he is, Bourne provided irresistable, intriguing escapism. I found it easy to suspend disbelief and go along for the ride. This third effort, however, insults the viewer's intelligence on too many levels. The plot is nonsensical and full of holes and the camera work is irritating. Unlike the first two films I didn't engage with this at all. At the end my reaction was an underwhelming - so what? The makers have gone for an easy option, formulaic hotch potch - a \\"this will do, it's only an action movie\\" product lacking in character, motivation or even thought. This could have been a great series. A series it will still probably be, but any pretence at quality has gone with this poor effort.

Just simply an amazing book.
0375831002|5.0|Death, as a writer, has a very odd way of composing this book.  At first I was turned off by the style, interruptions, and seemingly disorganization; but I grew to appreciate it as a necessary element of the story itself.  Most World War II stories are about the strength of the people placed in concentration camps, but this story focuses on the lives of the German common people and the continuing innocence of childhood.  It was also refreshing to see this young girl develop a love for books and writing, and to see that love save her life.  I recommend this book not only for all young adults but for mature adults as well.

But if you love Whitney the artist then you can overlook her career setbacks and appreciate this album which I did.
B000WQW988|5.0|It took about 14 years for the Nirvana: Unplugged In New York to come out on DVD, but the finished product is well worth the wait. Seeing this show uncut, in it's entirety really captures how intimate this performance was. The special features include the Original MTV version of this performance, a \\"Bare Witness\\" MTV News special, and the best part, which was the rehearsals for five songs; Come As You Are, Polly, Plateau, Pennyroyal Tea, and The Man Who sold The World. The sound and picture quality is great, and it stings a little seeing Kurt Cobain so clearly in such an intimate setting, nevertheless, this is a performance not to be missed. Now they should release MTV Live and Loud on DVD, which was great also.
B00009ZYC0|5.0|`Minority Report' is one of those movies that just gets better and better EVERY TIME I watch it.  It's beautifully constructed, intense, meaningful, thought provoking, thrilling...an all around edge of your seat thriller that delivers on every front.  Stephen Spielberg, the man who's famous for delivering intense science fiction thrillers doesn't disappoint this go around either.  `Minority Report', while remarkably absent from the Oscar shortlist, makes a huge impact on the viewer.  From an impressive and remarkably realistic script (we'll get to that in a minute) to the superb special effects and some well handled performances `Minority Report' never fails at being spellbinding.<br /><br />So let's tackle that script for a minute.  The thing that I love most about films of this nature is that they challenge the audience to think about the future in ways they maybe don't want to.  While films like `I, Robot' may take things a little overboard (while I don't think that the idea of robots providing assistance is out of the question) there are films like `A.I.' and the like that tackle things in a manner that is believable.  Now, while the initial concept of psychics predicting murders and thus stopping crime altogether is a bit far fetched, the world in general that is portrayed for us in `Minority Report' is not.  A world that follows us around, watching our every move so as to `serve' us better is, in my humble opinion, right around the corner.<br /><br />`Minority Report' also broaches on the subject of humanity and our willingness to suffer for the betterment of others.  The three precogs give up their freedom, their lives, their shot at anything remotely normal in order to help the government stop the plague that is murder.  Sure, what they are doing is something admirable and it makes life in general so much better for the rest of upstanding society, but do we think about what this means for them.  They are forced to relive nightmarish situations over and over with no sense of comfort.  `Minority Report' also asks the viewer to contemplate how necessary this scenario really is.  Now one can argue that murder is wrong, but is it really necessary to lock someone away for a crime they have yet to commit, especially when it is one of passion that merely needs to be prevented, not avenged?<br /><br />Spielberg's handling of the material is utter perfection here.  He directs a masterpiece, giving us cinematic gold.  There really is nothing about this film I can pick at or find as a fault, and I am an adamant Cruise hater, but even he delivered wonderfully here, really digging into the heart of his character to deliver real signs of pure emotion.  Colin Farrell delivers a fine breakthrough performance for himself.  This was the role that got him noticed and preceded his 2003 rise to fame.  Max von Sydow is also deliciously mysterious as Lamar but it's Samantha Morton (an actress who is just orgasmic in everything) who steals the show here.  Her portrayal of Agatha is honest and fragile and the backbone to the end of the show.<br /><br />So, it's obvious that `Minority Report' has left me smitten and I hope that it will do the same for you.  It's one of those movies that impresses the first go around, but it begins to root itself in its audience after repeated viewings.  There is no denying it is a masterful piece of American cinema.  One of the movies I'll never get tired of that is as visually stunning as it is mentally captivating.  A true triumph of cinematic bliss.of comfort.  `Minority Report' also asks the viewer to contemplate how necessary this scenario really is.

Colin Farrell delivers a fine breakthrough performance for himself.  This was the role that got him noticed and preceded his 2003 rise to fame.  Max von Sydow is also deliciously mysterious as Lamar but it's Samantha Morton (an actress who is just orgasmic in everything) who steals the show here.  Her portrayal of Agatha is honest and fragile and the backbone to the end of the show.      So, it's obvious that `Minority Report' has left me smitten and I hope that it will do the same for you.  It's one of those movies that impresses the first go around, but it begins to root itself in its audience after repeated viewings.  There is no denying it is a masterful piece of American cinema.  One of the movies I'll never get tired of that is as visually stunning as it is mentally captivating.  A true triumph of cinematic bliss.
B000067UUJ|5.0|I'm a sucker for live performances, and Muse puts out one of the best. Their concerts are something else, you MUST go see one if you're a fan. Hullabaloo is like a little taste of that in your own home.
B000001ABD|4.0|I loved only one of the two cd's I wish they had been sold seperatly. The other that I do not like has gotten no play time and is really a waste of a cd.
0393327655|4.0|I give this book only 4stars and for good reason. Yes these monotheistic religions do pose a threat to the future of humanity. However, the specific threat of Islam is blown a bit out of proportion. While Muslims scholars did not issue a sufficient number of edicts and sermons against terrorisms at the time of the writing of \\"End of faith,\\" they did it and using strong language in the most recent Arafat sermon during the 2007 pilgrimage.     Additionally, as someone who lives in Jordan and spent a good amount of time in Lebanon I can say with a good amount of confidence that what he writes about honor killings in Jordan and Lebanon is 30-50% blown out of proportion. I would greatly advise Mr.Harris to come and visit these two countries to get a more up close view.
1421804522|1.0|Don't buy this version.  The translation does not flow like some of the others.  There are also many typos in this version. The Susan Bernofsky version, or other earlier versions are much better.
0307276902|1.0|I read this book without knowing the controversy surrounding the veracity of the author's accounts. Initially the book resonants with anybody that has dealt with any sort of addiction but soon outlives it's emotional impact and becomes some kind of Robin Hood tale for drug addicts. This guy who has faced the worst that one can face comes out of the other side as a shining star and model for hardened addicts everywhere. I was insulted that James Frey portrayed this as a memoir, it felt like a betrayal or our basic intelligence as readers. Although this work has been lauded as inspirational for addicts everywhere, I feel it's an insult to the only system in place that seems to be able to help addicts, AA.
B000002GLV|5.0|GREAT CD----originally had the album.   Love it when, during a live performance the audience is detirmined to hear their favorites and keep yelling while he is trying to speak or play. John finally says, \\"What--did ya come here to hear an old record?\\"  Some fantastic talent on this musical little masterpiece.  Have a listen to some of the tunes on line then go buy it.
B00008FPZ6|1.0|my favourite record as a young stripling was a crackly worn out black vinyl pressing of \\"we're only in it for the money\\" so when this disc came out in 1985 or so, i snatched it up. but what happened to my memories? fz remixed it into a mess. what a disappointment. i waited another decade to buy the less butchered (but still wrong) version, [[ASIN:B0000009RX We're Only in It for the Money]], that finally replaced this & i still have both.    i gave it one star but that's only for \\"lumpy gravy\\" for which i haven't such a sentimental attachment - \\"we're only in it for the money\\", in this remix, gets zero stars. not polite to speak ill of the dead, but what the ---- was fz thinking when he created this mess?
B000059T1E|5.0|One of the best pieces of music ever recorded. Not a bad song on the whole CD. Unique ---unlike any others. LOVE \\"Traffic\\"
B000WZAE1I|4.0|Add a old grandfather telling this story to a young sick boy and you begin to see what I saw here, another delightful story that made me reminisce about childhood fairytales. DeNiro and Pfeiffer you figure are going to be good, but the rest the cast are very engaging and make this an above par fantasy. In fact a very, very good one, borderline great one. I found myself comparing it to the \\"Princess Bride\\" and \\"Ever After\\" in action, adventure, humor, sets, and music. I mean this in a very good way. The story is of an illigitimate son from a princess that lives in a fantasy land across a physical wall in England. The wall separates the two worlds. When the son that lives with the father in the real world sets out to find what's left of a fallen star in the fantasy world for his girlfriend, he finds himself in the adventure of a lifetime. Add the often comedic adventures of four sons also trying to recover a red gem to become king and it rounds the story out nicely. If you enjoy fantasy movies I highly recommend you catch this one. After viewing it I certainly intend to buy it myself. Good quality sound and picture and the DVD comes with standard extras. Please be sure to read Tom Knapp's in depth review, A new classic, it is quite good.
B000002G87|4.0|Key to the Highway is a long number on this CD and that is why I bought it.  Long ago I had the album.  Was on my way to work and \\"Key to the Highway\\" came on---first I had ever heard it. Before it was over I had parked and was supposed to get into the building but chose to be late so I would not miss a note and could find out WHO was playing---knew I was going to go buy whatever album it was on.  This a a great little piece of quality musicianship.  And to this day I hit the \\"repeat\\" button when \\"Key\\" is on.  Whole CD is good, but KEY is awesome.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|I RARELY--if never--write reviews for music.  But this time I'm simply compelled to acknowledge such talent! Its such a shame that main stream music hardly ever comes up with anything thats worth while.  Sara Bareilles is simply fantastic.  I can't stop listening to her voice.  Her music does not contain any fluffy pieces.  She brings in mind Sarah Mclachlan.  Her songs are simply so well-done that you don't get tired of listening to it over and over.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|i'm very picky with music.  only albums i've bought in the last few years are tool's, a perfect circle's, and system of a down's.  i haven't really liked... anything.  this is awesome.  if you didn't tell me it was serj's solo project, i would have thought it was another System of a down album.  it's a tad lighter & overall more... melodic?  i absolutely adore it, can't wait to get to my car to and from work so i can listen to it.
B000VKW7AK|5.0|I already had Countdown and United, but I bought this so I wouldn't have to buy a complete set of CDs, some (most?) of which have been remastered by now.  This box set is remastered, but remastered is probably all I can get now, as is the case with most Metallica CDs.  I agree with another review that many of the songs lack low end.  I changed the settings on my equalizer to boost the bass, and the songs sound a lot heavier.  I still have some changes to make in order for the songs to sound even better, but boosting the bass and treble were a good start.  If you don't boost the bass, this collection will sound blander than it should.  I don't have a subwoofer yet, but boosting the bass is definitely recommended regardless.  With these things in mind, this box set is a must-have for any Megadeth fan.
B00005JPRZ|5.0|Haven't thought of a funeral could be so funny and make me laughing and bending over to the next empty seat.<br /><br />The British do know how to make a good comedy. Death at a Funeral managed to turn a sad occasion upside down while at the same time revealed all the dirty laundry and dark secrets of the main characters that made them interesting. Characters like a self-centred prick who preferred to spend his money on a first class ticket instead of his father's funeral, an uptight lawyer fell prey to hullucination drugs, an arrogant doctor who thought the whole world couldn't match up with him. These are just some of the interesting people you will meet at this funeral.<br /><br />Some of the plots were a bit predictable - basically you know what is coming around the corner. However, it was the way they wrote it and made it that made the film so enjoyable. All the subtleness that revealed just enough comic moments to keep you going and going. There was a bit of physical comedy elements like their American counterparts, but it is the well written British humour that shaped the movie which could easily make it a classic. Some of the topics they touched on were not new, e.g. homosexuality and drugs, but the modern touch up did make it look more refreshing.<br /><br />I will highly recommend it if you want an relaxing evening out for a good laugh. I think the British did it again :)
B00004WNRR|5.0|Don't Listen to the poser on the last comment, Purple Rain is not an album simply being put to shame because he/she thinks that Darling Nikki is better by the Foo Fighters (absolutly not, in fact, Prince did a cover of the Foo's \\"Best of You\\" at the superbowl, and it blew theirs away)....This LP is one of the Prince's and History's greatest albums of all time, so I recommend this LP to all Prince fans and LP collectors alike...Great Buy and you can get it for a great price..
B000UR9TQE|5.0|I'm not one of these hard core fans who have 12 previous versions of TSRTS.  I don't have a High Def Large Screen TV, nor do I have a theater system on my tv.  I really enjoyed it though!  Looks and sounds great!
B001041JLE|1.0|This is a fan rip-off!The original album is untouchable. But this is not about that. It is about these lousy remixes and missed opportunities to fill this anniversary set with new unreleased stuff.Remixes&#34;The Girl Is Mine&#34; - best remix by Will.I.Am - 7/10&#34;P.Y.T.&#34; - not so good remix by Will.I.Am - 3/10&#34;Billie Jean&#34; - not able to listen to that - 0/10&#34;Beat It&#34; - Fergie's destroys the original - 0/10&#34;WBSS&#34; - like Fergie he destroys the original - 0/10Unacceptable for a true music fan!
B000K15VSA|5.0|I see a lot of opinions from folks who say the director's cut is better than the theatrical release.  But the main reason given is because that's the way R.Scott originally intended for it to be.  That's not much of a reason.  I've held somewhat of a grudge against Mr.Scott for a while because he's the main reason I could not get a DVD copy of the theatrical version.  I saw the theater version in the early 80's on VHS and loved it so much I wore out the tape.  When the director's cut came out eventually on DVD, I was disappointed that the movie was not as I remembered it.  The narration adds such a great feel to the movie.  I don't think it was over-done, meaning, it didn't dumb the movie down by trying to dictate to the audience what to think as they were watching.  The narration didn't try to fill in all the blanks or define each scene.  It simply gave a glimpse into the mind of the main character and, in my opinion, gave the movie more depth.  And, as I said, it gave such a great film-noir feel, which is one of the reasons I loved it so much the first time I saw it.  This movie is one of my all-time favorites and I will spend extra for the set, knowing that I will only ever watch the theatrical version.  As for the rating, the five stars is certainly for the movie itself.  Having to buy 5 discs to get the one I want is irritating, to say the least.
B000P0J0G0|4.0|and it is likely more than any one fan really needs, for the diamonds and the dregs both are preserved on these discs. Laurie is now a big star on American TV as the lead actor in \\"House\\", one of my favorite shows, and Fry is an occasional supporting player in \\"Bones\\", another of my can't miss broadcast offerings. On the product under discussion, you can see pretty much where they got their television start, beginning about 20 years ago as a sketch comedy duo. For my taste, the earliest work was the most enjoyable, and the other three DVD's were a bit less worthwhile as a whole. Many of the sketches are of interest mainly to people living in England at the time they were created. Some of the others suffer from my not being at the top of my game in comprehending British accents or slang. The great moments are indeed, worthy of that word. I did have many, many laughs, but for repeated enjoyment of the talents of these two fools, I recommend the \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" box instead. Or, you could rent the human-actor version of \\"101 Dalmatians\\" and see Hugh Laurie as a bumbling burglar who makes his brief appearance into a real gem. Also see J.C. Clark's review here, which makes some excellent points about the pros and cons of \\"complete box sets\\" like this.
B000TFINY6|5.0|this is a excellent dvd package.  And with blu ray you get the best picture available too.  The lost saga continues to amaze due to it's interesting storyline and the show has never looked better than on blu ray dvd.  One can only hope that as time passes the studios will figure out to use as much space as they can on each disc. with this series they did just that.  but both hd and blu ray are guilty of not giving alot of extras on most discs. For the price that is paid, each disc is a special edition and should be treated as such.  Lost season three puts the whole series on four discs and this only proves that the hd formats are not usually using all the space available.  this one does  it right though and is a great buy for fans and just casual viewers as well.

B00005QDW5|3.0|I love Pink Floyd, I am an avid collector of their music-videos and other assorted \\"hard to get items\\". There are few bands that are hard pressed to do a \\"greatest hits\\" and Pink Floyd is definitely one of them. Why? they had a theme that ran from album to album..not looking for the hit single but rather to take you on a journey at that album's time and place but I do understand people needing a hits album to get the songs that they enjoy so If you must though get a taste of PF this set is at least good one.
B000VWYNNW|3.0|i'm pissed that this cd was re-issued with different, edited versions of what was on the original release. it's kind of like mom cooking your favorite dish for years then one day changing the ingredients. \\"but mom, the way you made it before was best.\\" it's a let down really. sure the added songs are cool, but the edited ones aren't. how can you call this cd the same title, when it's not the same songs as on the original edition. ugghhh! it is so freakin' obvious. the guitar solo at the end of 'celebration day' is completely different than the original edition. the original version of the soundtrack is the best!
6305263248|3.0|This is a mediocre action movie with 2 redeeming attributes. Deniro's performance as a jaded tough guy ex-CIA spy who has a world weary-Seen it all attitude that he carries off very well and a couple of incredible car chases through Nice and Paris.<br /><br />The plot is pretty standard spy movie stuff, some of the dialogue is contrived and wooden tough guy stuff and Natascha McElhone as the woman leading this operation is absolutely miscast and awful. Her delivery at times is almost comical it's so off.
B00006CXSS|5.0|WOW The sound on this DVD is spectacular! If you have 5.1 system w/DTS you'll love the bullets whiz by and the rumble of tank approaching then blam they're on the screen. The explosions are massive and deafening. I thought Saving private Ryan was a superb movie but this series blows it away. The only thing that puzzles me is why have closed captioning in Spanish. I wanted to give this to some older friends who love closed captioning and a friend who learns English by matching the words with the spoken words....Nah. I still rate it five stars and I love Amazon because I was able to get this great series for $25.00 Thank you Amazon your special deals are true!
141694740X|2.0|The cover of this book makes the book look very interesting, it it is an easy read but this book is not a page turner.This book try to expose mens feelings which really does not work. Also this book is not for a man to read because he will end up putting it down. This is only one side and basically does not give men leeway.
B000AC5B0M|5.0|Leos Janacek.  Good music writing.  Good writing for human voices.  Dramatic, emotional singing.  I have no idea what there saying, but I know just what they mean.  The lady especially.  She sing like she about to come out of her bodice.  I only sample this music, but it almost scorch the hairs right out of my ears.  When I save up enough moneys then I buy it.  The cheap one for 43 dollar new and used.  I dubs that one.  Okay?  Dont you buy it.  Okay?
1434815846|5.0|I saw this script produced at the Castle Museum in York during its first run. It's the most faithful adaptation I have ever seen of A Christmas Carol, which is one of my favourite novels.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000VAPZM2|4.0|What a great angle for the DVD release: film a song sequence that edits cleanly out of the broadcast premiere, then put it back to create an \\"extended edition.\\" It certainly did not hurt the success of the Disney Channel premiere of High School Musical 2 did not include the song \\"Humuhumunukunukua'pua'a,\\" and it made the DVD premiere all the more exciting for the millions of fans who have made this one of the biggest  pop culture  icons of our era.<br /><br />The song, by the way, is surely an affectionate nod in a way to Annette Funicello, whose top 10 hit, \\"Pineapple Princess\\" is referenced in the lyrics. The whole infectious silliness is very much in the fun style of the early Disney pop tunes.<br /><br />And the movie is very much in the spirit of the bubbly 60's Beach Party movies that starred Annette and Frankie Avalon, though High School Musical has more budget and less innuendo. One could even draw a direct parallel between the poolside finale and Annette's poolside number in the film, Pajama Party.<br /><br />To its credit, the High School Musical sequel is true to its original style and does not give into what was surely a temptation to cash in on the success with endless cross promotion (\\"Hey everybody! Look who's just dropped in! It's TV's Regis Philbin!\\") There are very subtle cameos by Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers strictly for eagle-eyed fans and that's about it.<br /><br />The bloopers are especially ingratiating, showing the cast off to its most endearing advantage. It looks like everyone's having a ball making the movie, though it's also very hard work as other special features prove (i.e. Zac Efron taken through take after take on his \\"Bet on It\\" number.<br /><br />No tween home will likely be without one of these DVDs. Say what you want about this franchise, it's perhaps the clearest parallel from the Mickey Mouse Club days to today, utilizing a talented stock company of young talent and giving them fun, frothy entertainment to shine in.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I purchased this CD when it was released almost ten years ago, and it's still my all-time favorite!
B000QUGWDS|5.0|This was probably my favorite show from the 70's and I have worn out the dvds I have of the first season of SWAT. I have been waiting and waiting for the second season to come out and I am still waiting but in the meantime these downloads are the next best thing.  I first found out you could watch the second season of SWAT over at AOL video for free and so that is where I was watching them. Then someone asked me about the ones over here at amazon and I was so happy to find them since these episodes are far better than the ones I was watching and they don't have any commericals. I had no problem at all paying 1.99 per episode because the quality of this player is amazing and so easy to use. Over at AOL you never knew if the player was going to work or not and most times it didn't. I have never had any problems with the episodes I have downloaded from amazon.  Like the other reviewer said the main thing is how much space they take up on a hard drive.     One other problem is that some people can't get them to work. After I found out about the episodes being here I told everyone I knew to come get them and only one other person has been able to get them to work for them. I don't know if they don't have new enough systems or what but they certainly have been disappointed.    As I said I have watched the first season over and over and as much as I love the first season I have noticed that the quality of the program really improved in the second season and they branched out more and tried a lot of different things in the second season. It really is a shame that my friends aren't able to watch these episodes and enjoy them as much as I have been.    I hope that eventually the second season will be available on dvd but until then I will continue to enjoy the downloads.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Who dared to dream of this....    Two new disks of Blade Runner related music, in one go! Sold together with the 1994 release, to have it all in one buy.    Disk 1 is the album as we knew it. Blade Runner's most famous themes in perfect sound quality, together with some unused recordings, made into one big \\"story\\". There's a reason this is one of the best loved movie scores ever.    Disk 2 provides some of the movie's themes and moods that didn't make it into the first album, as well as some wonderful pieces that weren't finally used in the movie. Of the three disks, this is the dark one; the desolate place Blade Runner's overcrowded world has turned into. This entire album is comprised of music made in 1982 for the movie, although some of it was not used in the movie, and other tracks were used but are presented here in longer, more developed versions. All the lush and major themes were on disk one, leaving this the brooding, dark, melancholic atmosphere, with a few delightfully bright breaks. An intriguing album for anyone who has complained the first release wasn't dark enough, omitting the intense and rainy music scapes. You can't listen to this CD without finding yourself in the world we saw and lived in while watching Blade Runner.    With disk 3, Vangelis expands the world of Blade Runner, with new music he created to celebrate the movie's 25th Anniversary. Vangelis seems to explore different parts of this world, and does manage to find, among all the rain and darkness, a few brighter spots as well. Undeniably Blade Runner, yet also completely new and modern. A thoroughly inspiring album of music, that needs attention to be listened to and this time will ask you to imagine your own scenes. As inspiring as it is on first listen, like all the better albums, for full appreciation it needs some getting used to, but grows with every listen. An intriguing addition to the release and a great album in its own right.    What a pity that the purists are always making themselves the loudest. Sure, this is not the full 100% exactly what a few of the purist completist fans of the movie were dreaming about. Sure, a few desirable cues are indeed still missing. But this comes with so much more, which altogether easily makes up for the omissions. But the purists are so busy complaining about what's not on there, they don't find the time to explore what actually *is* on there.     To think, while one person may complain the bootlegs' extended End Titles version is not included, another is unhappy because many of the tracks on this release extend beyond what we heard of them in the movie. You can't please everyone, it simply defies logic. One is bound to be disappointed when listening to this CD only to compare it with preconceived expectations, rather than to enjoy the music.    Did anyone ever notice how boring these bootlegs (that the purists keep referring to) actually were, to listen to? These two new official CDs instead present the music as *music*, as much as *atmosphere*, a work of art that can live on its own. Not a set of cues used in the background of a movie, but instead an actual album of music derived from its inspiring source.    Well, I guess anything linked to Blade Runner cannot be released without its share of some controversy. So, do be sure to check out this marvellous release, and remember not to be discouraged by its critics, just like all of us never let the movie critics take our \\"Blade Runner\\" away. Instead, close your curtains, turn off the lights, put on the headphones and listen to almost 3 hours of Vangelis' \\"Blade Runner\\" genius!
B000067CPX|3.0|I bought this album based on a friend's opinion. At first I loved the change in pace for a more consistent song by song approach. As usual this album like the others is diverse ranging from funk, physch, and reggae. Unfortunately, it didn't take me long to realize how boring and stale this album turned out. The songs for the most part are pretty good to listenable. There are a few stinkers in the bunch such as the sappy tear, and dosed, also the dreadfully boring I could die for you. The melodies are rich and beautiful throughout. Can't stop is the closest they get to their vintage sound. Flea is basically on stand-by during by the way except for a handful of songs. Songs like By the Way, Can't Stop, throw Away your television are great examples of Flea being utilized correctly. Instead John Frusciante's layered guitars and Anthony Kiedis's vocals are featured and in control. John plays beautifully but never exciting enough to keep me interested. On Mercury is about as interesting as it gets for it's the catchiest song on the record. Anthony is in his finest form vocally but his lyrics are his most cliched and irritating. Midnight is where Kiedis shines and is my personal favorite despite it being one of the few too many ballads on this disc. By the way is a very listenable but at times sappy effort that would make you go back to the period of the early days to Blood Sugar Sex Magic.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This is a very nice movie to watch with your family. The Picture Quality & Audio Quality is great, not the best but nevertheless great. This Hi Def HD DVD version is MUCH MUCH better then the DVD version.  It's a colourful adventure & well worth the money for an HD DVD movie. I recommend it.
B000G759LW|5.0|\\"Back To Basics\\" is another great album from Christina Aguilera.  It looks like she had some inspiration from songs from the 20's 30's and 40's cause it has an old-fashioned feel to it.  My favorite songs are \\"Candyman\\" and \\"Ain't No Other Man.\\"  If you liked the singles on the radio then you'll love \\"Back To Basics\\" another hit from Christina Aguilera.  She never ceases to amaze me. She puts Britney to shame! A+

B000K15VSA|5.0|If you don't like this movie or love it(like me), this Ultimate Set is top notch and a sight to be seen. The briefcase itself is plastic and is a bit of a disapointment, but once you open it, the contents inside, more than makes up for the that minor flaw. From the motion film clip, which greets you when u open it, down to the spinner toy, and all the variations of the movie(5 discs), it's worth the money you spent on it.
B000MV9026|1.0|I am another reviewer asking for the option of awarding 0 stars. I was compelled to watch this while visiting a relative and politeness was the lone reason I didn't exit the room within the first 5 minutes. As it progressed, I literally rolled my eyes until I thought they would fall out of my head and go under the coffee table. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, easily right up there with \\"Batman and Robin\\". I don't know where to start. The (vaunted?) musical numbers are a jaw dropping car wreck. The songs chosen are bizarre and off the wall. I found myself cringing with each new scene. I am uncomfortable knowing that this horrible garbage is what a large portion of the populace thinks of as \\"entertainment\\". The meandering plot, such as it is, is awash in tacky, unpleasant ideas, all of which should have been left on the cutting room floor. The pointless and unnecessary criticisms of humanity as a whole and organized spirituality in particular are tired and extremely well worn devices much beloved by lazy screenwriting HACKS. A dose of United Nations worship is then injected into the ridiculous ending. I found the \\"ethnic penguins\\" to be quasi-humorous, if not slightly offensive to the groups being portrayed. In no way would I subject children, adults or even farm animals to this animated travesty, as it is appropriate for no audiences at all. Avoid as if radioactive.
0064435962|5.0|My son is 2 and we love this book.  Its great for teaching body parts and involving him with action during reading.
B0000004V2|5.0|I grew up with this album in the heady days of the BritPop invasion. It's intertwined with my memories and always will be. Regardless of my sentimental attachment, this album is brilliant, and I've returned to it over and over again through the years, even as I have become an old geezer. Musically organic, totally stretched out, driving bass and drums, inspired guitar work; there won't be another one like this ever, no matter how many have tried to imitate it over the years. Remember how Shaun of the Dead wanted to verify that it was not this, the FIRST Stone Roses album, which was to be thrown at the zombies? Yes there is a reason he wanted to check. Even if you are threatened with flesh eating ghouls, this one is a keeper. My own highest recommendation.
B0000VD04M|5.0|who would ever think that a bio-pic about the worst director in the history of Hollywood would be one of the best movies ever. Credit Tim Burton and an incredible cast, Johnny Depp and Martin Landeau as Ed Wood and his hero Bela Lugosi have such an incredible chemistry and bond onscreen that is the heart and soul of this film. It's outright hilarious at times, moving and so believable. Simply one of my all-time favorite films. Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker also shine but the relationship between the faded Lugosi and aspiring Wood makes it so real.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|While there wasn't much response to the TV series or theatre release of the movie (of course there wasn't much advertising either), the DVD sales of Serenity and subsequently Firefly are through the roof.  I have yet to introduce this to someone who didn't like it.  This story needs more pumped into it.  There are so many plots from the series left to explore and such depth of the characters to push them forward.  Now all we need is some plausible cloning subplot or something of the sort to bring back Wash and Book.  Hmmmm.

B000K15VSA|5.0|This special edition could have sold for over $100 and still have been a great value. The packaging is way above the usual, the artifacts included are collector quality, and the enhanced sound mix on THE FINAL CUT must be heard to be believed.    Also, for your money you get THE ANSWER to THE QUESTION:    In a critical interview on Disc 2 \\"Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner,\\" Ridley Scott says the following in reference to the unicorn scenario:    \\"I want to see what's inside his {Deckard's} head, so it better be something extraordinary. So, he is a romantic because he's thinking about this unicorn {in the piano apartment scene} ... And so that at the end of the film, I can have something absolutely remarkable which I can illustrate, which is the unicorn ... and he goes like \\"Boom!\\" {when he picks up the origami unicorn.} How would anyone have known what was inside his head, other than someone who knew what was in his file? That had been implanted in his brain? Can't be any clearer than that. If you don't get it, you're a moron.\\"
B000UJBYD8|1.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I am a huge Cult fan.  For years, I wished for a new Cult album until 2001, when \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" was released.  I bought the album, but feared the worst - these \\"comeback\\" album usually suck and break the hearts of hardcore fans.  I was amazed at how good that album was!  There was no question - The Cult still had the juice.    It's amazing how much can change in six years.  \\"Born Into This\\" is the stereotypical lame flop I've been fearing.  Asbury sounds shaky and weak... he just sounds \\"old\\".  Duffy needs to find where \\"11\\" is on his amp again.  And the production just leaves the whole album flat; it sounds like a high school AV club project.  I had to force myself to listen all the way through the disc, hoping that it would improve.  I then forced myself to listen to it again, hoping that it would grow on me.      Neither worked, and this disc is ending up on the heap of examples of why music \\"sharing\\" is so popular.  We are sick of paying good money for turds like this.  I think my \\"Cult fan\\" status has now officially become \\"classic Cult fan\\".
B00009NDB8|4.0|I felt that this was a very well written account of her story.  I was immediately drawn into it.  It touched me deeply and I feel it should not only be read by women, but that men stand a lot to learn by reading it, as well.  I hope to God I will never experience something as devastating as what Ms. Sebold did, but I know that I have a better understanding of what rape victims go through after reading her account.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|For the professional scholar, the lack of statistics and heavy use of anecdotes may give reason to dismiss this piece, but rather than paint a broad statistical picture of modern healthcare, Michael Moore is driving us toward the one essential question: why not have government healthcare, when we have government-run firemen, police, courts, libraries, and schools?<br /><br />Sicko is especially effective in displaying how the notion of individualism undermines our ability to create a better society.  For me, the most interesting part of the documentary is when Moore interviews a former British politician, who deftly weaves together liberty, democracy, and basic human rights.<br /><br />Yes, there are sensational moments to the movie, but they do help underscore our failing as a society to back our rhetoric.  We say we have a culture of life, yet provide little support for mothers and families, especially when compared to the support given to families in other western countries.  We say we admire the heroes of 9/11 who valiantly dug through the rubble to save lives and clean the WTC site, yet many of those heroes now lack coverage or support for conditions caused by the pollution of the WTC site.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent documentary that, like most documentaries, is short on answers, but asks deep and troubling questions about our society.  It may make us uncomfortable, but it is an excellent documentary.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Lovely, subtle and quiet CD.  Stacy does not have a huge voice, but she does have quality, not quantity.  Many of the tracks on this CD are sambas/bossa nova which play into Stacy's strengths as a singer.<br /><br />A huge surprise on this CD is the new songs by her better half with lyricist Ishiguro.  Lovely catchy songs with lyrics that resemble Lorenz Hart at his best.<br /><br />Relatively little tenor sax from Tomlinson, though he plays flute and alto as well.
B000VWYJ8Q|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the movie until it couldn't play anymore.  Mailed it back and within 2 days I had a brand new one in hand.  I appreciate that type of service.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I'm not really a country music fan but I am a guitar player and know great playing when I hear it.  Read somewhere that Brad Paisley was worth listening to and I got two of his records (Mud on the Tires and this one (5th Gear)).  Yup, he's a very, very good guitar player.  Reminds me of a later-day Jerry Reed...great chops and a tendency to write goofy songs.
B000ZN8036|5.0|Let me come right and admit that I dislike Sean Penn a great deal.  His politics are infantile, silly and represent Hollywood's penchant for knee-jerk liberalism at its worst.  His trips to Iraq are an embarrassment.    But let me also admit that he truly is an artist to be reckoned with.  From his wonderful performances in FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH through is Oscar-winning work on MYSTIC RIVER, he has proven himself a unique talent.  And now his skills as a director cannot be overlooked either.  His past efforts as a director had merit, but with films like THE PLEDGE, he allowed himself an indulgent pace, and the movies meandered a bit.  They still showed skill...but only now, with INTO THE WILD, can he truly be called a director of importance.    Based on the terrific book from Jon Krakauer (who also wrote the MUST READ \\"Into Thin Air\\"), INTO THE WILD follows the true-story of Chris McCandless, a young man who drops out of life in a serious, disturbed way.    McCandless comes from a family of privilege.  Raised in the south, we see him graduating from prestigious Emory College, and telling his folks he's thinking of Harvard Law.  He clearly has a lot of issues with his folks and their materialism...but at first blush, he seems like little more than an upstart college kid who was raised in a cushy enough life to be able to readily shower disdain on money & materialism.  A poor kid would never do this.  He seems very close to his younger sister (Jena Malone), as they are united in their disregard for their parents (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt).    Turns out, Chris is going to drop out of their lives completely.  He gives away all his money and sets out on the road with his beat-up car, eager to \\"see America\\" and to live off the land (although frankly, living off the land for him seems to require lots of begging for money, taking handouts and eventually, when his car is trashed, accepting rides).  He even changes his name to Alexander Supertramp.  He's a drop-out on a mission to erase his past life as well.  He NEVER touches base with his family, even his beloved sister.    Eventually, he becomes more and more eager to tear himself away from the trappings of civilization, and he goes to the wilderness of Alaska, IN THE WINTER to live on his own.  He has almost no survival skills, and if not for stumbling upon an abandoned bus that had obviously once been used as a campsite, he probably would have died in a day or two.  As it is, his time in Alaska stretches on for weeks or months, and that's all I want to tell you, in case you didn't know how this story turns out.    Chris (or Alex) is a supremely annoying character to me.  I'm a man in my 40s with kids of my own, and so naturally I bristle at his cavalier hatred for his parents.  And I'm also annoyed at his thoughts on dropping out, which as I said seemed to involve mooching off of others.  As though our society owed it to him to support his noble desire to have no possessions, responsibilities, etc. etc.    But here's the surprising thing...as much as part of me disliked this young man and his questionable mission, I was drawn deeper and deeper into caring about what happened to him nonetheless.  Penn, and especially his young star, Emilie Hirsch, do a masterful job over the films 2.5 hour running time of making you empathize with this guy.      As we learn more about his relationship with his parents, we see that while he might be over-reacting, he does have legitimate gripes that go deeper than we thought at first.  He's trying to erase his identify, because it's been built on a lie in the first place.  He truly wants to strip away anything that reminds him of them and their world.  At first, just distance helps...but he begins to see that he himself needs to be laid bare.  He has an almost primal need, not to commune with nature, but to use that communion as a way of reducing him to just basic needs for food and shelter.  And at the end of the film, when we see that he has finally succeeded and has finally come full circle, it's a shattering moment.  Only then do we see the skill with which Penn (who also wrote the script) and Hirsch have led us.  We thought we knew what McCandless wanted from his journey...but what he came to was something different indeed.    Most of the movie deals with McCandless' encounters with the various people he meets.  He spends time working on a wheat harvesting crew run by Vince Vaughan.  He lives for several months with Catherine Keener and her husband in a desert in Arizona.  And most touchingly, he befriends a old veteran played by Hal Holbrook.  It's nice to see Vaughan play a normal guy at more or less a normal level of energy, rather than his over-the-top antic-ness.  But it is Keener and Holbrook who threaten to steal the show.  Keener plays a \\"hippie\\" who has dropped out of life to get away from a terrible sadness of her own.  She has a burden she carries that makes her both love McCandless like a mother AND to understand the grief McCandless's mother must be going through.  She infuses her character with sadness and toughness in equal measure.  It's an almost perfect role for Keener, who has an almost unique quality to her...one of smarts, sexiness, sadness and empathy.  I think there's a fair chance she'll be nominated for an Oscar.  An almost slam-dunk Oscar nomination for Hal Holbrook, however.  It feels like years since I've seen him in anything, and the 20 minutes or so he is in this movie are as quietly powerful as any 20 minutes I've seen this year.  His character has shut off from the world and lived in insulated sadness for decades.  McCandless comes into his life and shows him that the world still has something to offer him.  Holbrook responds and begins to open up.  He takes on physical tasks he didn't dare before.  But he also begins to love the young man who has brought him this renewal...and he knows this kid is going to leave soon and never be seen again.  Holbrook is masterful in his scenes, and his final few moments are quite powerful.    Another aspect of this movie to be savored is the sheer enjoyment of the beautiful American scenery.  We're taken all over the western half of our nation, and also to Alaska, and Penn allows plenty of time to take in the sights.  What a beautiful country the US is!!    The movie is not perfect.  Sometimes Hirsch relies a little too much on just smiling beatifically at people, and the almost reverent response they have towards him is a bit much.  He does become a character that the viewer cares about...but sometimes Penn plays him off as too \\"pure.\\"  He seems to have no interest in sex, for example...and this interesting aspect of his character is left unexplored and unexplained.  (Also, I got tired of Eddie Vedder's songs...his diction is so bad, it just sounded like whining.  And this is from a guy who sorta likes Pearl Jam.)    This is a broadly sweeping movie about a very tiny subject...one troubled man whose journey of self-discovery led him in unexpected ways.  In the great scheme of life, it isn't terribly important.  Yet it reminds us that the human heart is unfathomable, that reactions aren't predictable AND most importantly, that we can grow and learn and come to accept what life has dealt us.  The movie is sad, yet quite uplifting.  It is a movie that finds forgiveness and redemption in unexpected places.    So, it is with some chagrin that I must say I highly recommend this effort from Sean Penn.
0723257639|5.0|This book set is really lovely and is the actual original small hard-covered books with paper dust cover. Just what I wanted! The product shown in the picture does not do it justice and is hard for buyer to actually visualise the product. I just love THEM. Service from Amazon to Australia could not be faulted.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Because of the previews that we've all been seeing for the last month or so, I'm pretty sure there will be people who come into SWEENEY TODD not realizing it's a musical.  They will be in for a pretty big surprise.  TODD is a very different musical from the recent flurry we've had (DREAMGIRLS and HAIRSPRAY most recently).  Those films tell stories that lend themselves to songs.  After all, DREAMGIRLS is about singers, and HAIRSPRAY has talent show elements.  SWEENEY TODD, on the other hand is a pitch-black comedy/tragedy set in Victorian London about a man crazed by loss and a desire for vengeance who uses his skills as a barber to slit the throats of a great many of  his fellow citizens. And the helpful Mrs. Lovett, who owns the meat pie shop just below him, takes these victims and uses them to create the most tasty and meat-filled pies in the city.    Not exactly the stuff of most musicals, is it?  And the music and lyrics are from Stephen Sondheim, that most complex and witty of American musical theatre geniuses.  So the lyrics are filled with puns, tricky rhymes, and they wrap around complex musical arrangements.    So I know a lot of people will be put off by this film.  And that's too bad, because it is one of Tim Burton's best films ever.  (I admit, I'm not his biggest fan...to me his movies, while beautiful to look at, often lack a clear heart.  They often fail to capture me on a purely emotional level.  ED WOOD was a great film, and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is delight...but so many just left me scratching my head [especially BIG FISH]).  In TODD, Burton has found a piece of art in the original musical that he can adapt beautifully for his visual style without risking the dangerous heart at the center of it.    And of course, he had the great luck of casting Johnny Depp in the title role, and the even greater luck of finding out that Depp actually sings fairly well.  His voice is not drop-dead stunning, and  I doubt he could stand on a Broadway stage and fill thespace to the back rows...but he stays in tune, has a pleasant sound and best of all, he acts the absolute hell out of the part.  He never stops playing SWEENEY just so he can sing.  The songs grow organically from him, in the same way he imagines his razors grow from his arm.  It's a showy performance, and Depp also clearly doesn't care if he has the sympathy of the audience.  This is a good thing, because TODD commits some horribly unspeakable acts.  We shouldn't be snickering alongside him as though he were some sort of Victorian Freddy Krueger.  He's a man deranged by sadness and vengeance.  We understand how he has been misshapened...but we don't exactly love for it either.    Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett struggles more with her singing.  Her diction is not that great, so we actually miss a lot of her lyrics.  But she's a dynamic presence, so while less successful, I still have a hard time picturing any other recognizable actress handling the role better.  Alan Rickman is the reprehensible Judge Turpin who years before sent the young, naïve barber Benjamin Barker off to prison on a trumped up charge, just so he could have his way with Barker's wife and steal Barker's infant daughter.  Barker returns as Todd, eager for revenge, only to find that a horrible situation with the Judge is even worse.  Rickman has a nice singing voice (no surprise) and makes his judge a complex character.  Timothy Spall, as the beadle who also is Turpin's assistant, is the true slimy villain of the piece.  He has no complexities...he's just a horrible toad of a man.  And Sacha Baron Cohen has a comic turn as the barber Pirelli, who unwittingly helps kick start both Todd's legitimate and non-legitimate business concerns.    Visually, the movie is a treat.  Burton has managed to make his sets look like theatrical sets, yet his camera work leaves no doubt you are watching a film of dizzying technical skill.  It's a nice way to salute the theatrical roots of the piece, while making sure it doesn't seem stagy.      My only other gripe is the pace.  The movie is only 2 hours long...certainly shorter than the full theatrical production, which clocks in at nearly 3 hours.  But there were stretches where it still felt a little slack and I found myself wondering how much longer it was.  I don't want to give away too much plot, in case you aren't very familiar with the details of the story, but let's just say that anytime the \\"young lovers\\" appeared, I had to roll my eyes.  After the charisma and energy of Depp and Carter...they were just...well...annoying.    The film is \\"R\\" rated, and deserves to be.  I know a lot of teenage girls will want to see Depp (our 15  year old went with us) and I think that if they have some idea that this is a bloody, nasty Depp they are going to see, they can still enjoy it.  I wouldn't recommend the film for anyone younger than 14 or so, at best.  The killings are truly over the top, but that doesn't mean that folks might not find the spraying arterial blood a bit upsetting.  This is not a \\"feel good\\" movie...just because it's a musical.  Sondheim always was a master of the dark musical...and TODD is one of his darkest.  But it has so many pleasures both for the ear and eye that I highly recommend it.  Just don't be surprised to find 50% of it is sung, and you'll be okay.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|I just bought the DVD 4-disc version of Blade Runner.  I am here to tell people thinking of buying this disc to buy the 4-disc version over the 5-disc because it is ridiculously under-priced!  The sound and picture on ALL the versions is impeccable and you can see the evolution of the film in these 4 prints.  I had the priviledge to see the \\"Work Print\\" at a theater in Seattle about 6 or so years ago...I have no idea how they got it or why they played it because everyone in the theater was completely surprised - you know the minute the movie starts that this is not the same \\"Blade Runner\\" from 1982.  It is interesting as a one-time view but after that has little relevance.  If needed rent the 5-disc set and watch it once.  Also, the \\"Dangerous Days...\\"  making of documentary is simply one of the best I've ever seen, well worth the price just by itself.  Otherwise - cheers to Warner Brothers for a fantastic Christmas gift!  Now if they could just do something about \\"OUTLAND\\"!!
0143038419|5.0|Despite the title suggesting three separate pursuits, this book is actually a comprehensive spiritual journey, exploring the sacred act of reintegrating body, mind, and heart/soul, and then living one's life from that authentic core.  Having spent most of her life anticipating, then meeting, the expectations of others, at the cost of expressing who she really was, an emotional crisis precipitates the realization that she can no longer continue to compromise herself.  But who, exactly, is she?  The author sets out to explore what it will take to bring herself fully back to life, to be willing to trust and love again.  In the universal nature of her search, she becomes \\"Everywoman.\\"  We are invited inside the author's mind as she courageously and humorously shares everything she perceives about herself on her literal and metaphorical travels.  Some of the most valuable observations come as she wrestles with her egoic mind in India, striving to drop - beneath the chatter and the drama churned up by her thoughts - to the small still place within, where illumination and serenity reign.  When she finally has her breakthrough, it is clear that her life has begun to shift into a new way of living, proceeding more intuitively, trusting the ebb and flow of the process.  In the end, the love she feared she would never find comes to her.. because she has learned to first find it within herself.  This is a fabulous book, a feast of words and hope, rich in insights and unique descriptions.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|The original production with Michael Crawford was SPECTACULAR-  But this production is noteworthy.  Kudos to Gerard Butler, who turns in a good performance as the Phantom! (Will wonders never cease???)  Beautiful art direction, costumes and... the MUSIC OF THE NIGHT!
B00006DEF9|5.0|The movie is so fun and entertaining. Great family movie. I couldn't believe the actress is the same one in Halloween Town (Disney movie =]). She is so adorable and .. cool! I love the scene when she meets the guy at the party and starts to sing \\"all i do is dreaming of you\\".. So CUTE... The second half of the movie is kind of long. The movie is great though and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. A must have!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|If you love the other Die Hards, you will love this movie.  The 4th Die Hard features Bruce Willis at his best - one liners and tons of action.  The movie is filled with stunts - even more than its predecessors.  The dialogue is funny - Justin Long and Bruce Willis are great together.  Kevin Smith was perfectly cast as the Warlock.      All in all, a great movie.  I've seen it a dozen times and look forward to another dozen, which puts it on par with Die Hard[[ASIN:B000O77SRC Die Hard]] and Die Hard: With a Vengeance[[ASIN:B0006GAI82 Die Hard with a Vengeance (Widescreen Edition)]].

1401307787|5.0|This book delves more into the actual daily practice of mindfulness.  I like it!
B00005JLWN|5.0|Just watched it. It's a really good movie IMO and very similar to V for Vendetta. In both movies, the system is overthrown by the achievements of one skilled man (of course with help from other characters and lucky circumstances). While V remains in the underground, main character Cleric John Preston is a government official. By first accidentally and later intentionally leaving out his daily dose of sedative drugs (which all of the population has to take), his \\"awakening\\" is initiated. Because of his innate ability to feel and the newly gained ability to see the cruelties of the militant, killing regime, he receives one shock after the other, but quickly learns to develop a strategic enclosure to keep his position and save his life. He meets other people in the resistance movement that play this strategic game too.    With some unexpected turnarounds, the movie is thrilling until the very end. The actors are perfectly suited for the main characters: Cleric Preston (Christian Bale) as a man of conscience and the vice-chancellor as perfect psychopath, who says in one of the last scenes (paraphrasing), \\"don't take away my dreams.\\"    So, the movie is worth the money -- at least, that is -- because it presents a handy metaphor for the process of awakening, seeing, receiving shocks, building of a strategic enclosure and \\"acting for one's destiny\\", regardless of the difficulties. The shock for the audience of the movie is to see how our reality is slowly turned into that presented in Equilibrium...    Get it and spread it around!
0757302661|2.0|I have read this and over a dozen other books as part of my labor doula training.  Now, as an expectant mother, I've discussed this curriculum with several doulas, midwives, and midwife assistants.  I also audited the class last year.      Bottom line: If you want to learn about childbirth preparation, there are better books (Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth, Kitzinger). If you want to learn about overly interventionist hospital policies and practices, there are better books (Missed Conceptions, Wolfe; Ina May Gaskin, etc.).  If you want an emotionally and spiritually connected approach to birthing, Birthing from Within is great. If you want to develop relaxation techniques that work specifically for you, paying a few bucks for the book won't hurt, but the class is over $400, for that money you could meet one-on-one with a licensed hypnotherapist who could tailor techniques just for you.    Mongan's basic principle, that a relaxed woman will labor more effectively, is something I believe whole-heartedly. I'm even planning a homebirth. But the idea that it *shouldn't* hurt if I'm doing the exercises right is overstated and, frankly, I think abusive to women.  As if barfing during transition is a sign of a character flaw. The section on pushing the baby out is particularly misleading and wildly unrealistic.    I like that they're encouraging people to demand more compassionate care in labor and delivery.  But this movement seems more invested in making a brand for itself than in thoughtful, well-reasoned, well-researched approaches to improving maternity care.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B000UNYJXQ Sicko (Special Edition)]]<br />This was one of the best movies to show the people of the U.S.A. how sick our health care system really is. It is all about Money, Money, money, ect. We need the Democrat party back in office next election or we are all doomed!

6304711905|5.0|Tombstone has been one of my favorite contemporary westerns.  I found the film to have the same qualities of the movie classics such as High Noon and Magnificent Seven yet updated with more realistic acting and dialogue.  The oldies were great, but the acting was stylized.  Tombstone portrayed their characters with a natural acting style which, I feel, is more believable than older films.  I loved Kurt Russell's strength, with lines like, \\"I'm coming and hell's coming with me!\\".    The brightest light, however, was Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holliday.  I feel that \\"Tombstone\\" has been his defining role in film, and one of the best charachter roles in film, period.  Here's to ya' Doc! for such a memorable performance.
B000OLGCHA|5.0|there are several negative reviews and most of them mention that while liking The Goble of Fire CD they do not care for this one.  I happen to think this CD is terrific.  The Goblet of Fire CD is not as good as this in my opinion.  I think the music is fresh, exciting and takes a different course than the other films.  I happen to like the music from all of the films, but as for Goblet of Fire music I prefer the arrangements used in the Music From the Harry Potter Films CD rather than the actual Goblet of Fire soundtrack. As an addition to continue to collect Harry Potter music the Order of the Phoenix CD is great.  I nearly didn't buy it because of some of the reviews but I am so glad that I did.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|I'm generally not a big fan of ultra wacky comedy films but the '01 release of 'Zoolander' starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson is definitely an exception to the rule. This is probably one of the most amazingly original, dementedly funny films I've ever seen. The hilarious physical comedy, off-the-wall dialogue and the clever, neverending parade of cameo appearances by the rich and famous will keep you glued to the screen.<br /><br />This one is a classic and definitely a worthy addition to your private DVD collection.

B000ZOW96Y|4.0|This movie starts off and ends well, but is a bit slow in the middle.    I'm starting to tire of the suspension of disbelief, not just of the scope of the job, but of all the zillion little details and coincidences that make every minute detail of the project work.    Al Pacino is excellent in this, as always, and I love Ellen Barkin - she is still sooo sexy. And kudos for making a trilogy where an star-studded ensemble works so well - its rare.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|My roommate introduced me to this series this year, explaining that I absolutely had to watch it or he would never forgive me.  And I understand why.  It's a well-done space western with great characters, good music, and fantastic writing.    The addictive thing about Firefly is that it's essentially a character study.  There are nine members of the crew of Serenity, each of whom has a completely different personality.  In the course of the show, you get to know each character's wishes, dreams, vices, etc.  You come to love every character, even the ones to whom you can barely relate.    But what really makes the show is Joss Wheedon's writing.  The series is full of laugh-out-loud lines (which means an awful lot, coming from me) and fantastic situations.  The addition of an awesome soundtrack with influences from everything from Chinese to old western music, not to mention a theme song that's simple and beautiful, doesn't hurt.    The plot is basically concerned with following the various heists and misadventures that speckle the lives of the ragtag and sometimes criminal crew of the spaceship Serenity.  One failing is that in the course of these 14 episodes, there isn't a great deal of plot.  I should adjust that statement: the episodes themselves are tightly plotted and fast-moving, and there's some set up for an overarching plot, especially with the character of River Tam.  But there aren't many ties from one episode to another, and sometimes you aren't sure whether one day, one week, or six months have passed between episodes.  They generally don't tie together, though there are exceptions.  I'm not sure whether to blame Wheedon for not writing enough ties between the episodes, or to blame Fox for canceling the series before he could develop a large enough fan base to afford introducing a lot of plot.  What we get is a very episodic character study, which suits geeks like me.  And I guess that kind of thing is typical for dramas.      Of course, if you want tosee these characters involved in a plot, you can watch \\"Serenity,\\" the feature film follow-up to the canceled series.    I could explain plots and characters, but it's essentially more fun to see the series and learn them yourself.  If you don't feel like buying the series, then just find your geekiest friend, especially if he or she likes spaceships.  Chances are that such a friend already owns the series.
0060920084|3.0|This was a trip the author could have missed.  He finds mostly small ugly towns without good motels, surly waittresses and mediocre meals.  On the way he seems to somehow miss towns in the area that are unique and well rounded.      I got tired of reading about his misfortunes and rude treatment.  This should have been a short story. JEF
B000TLTUL0|4.0|I am a great admirer of Sondheim and this work. I saw the original production a few times, and thought the filmed version of the performance with George Hearn (more human, less monster) replacing Len Cariou was even better. However, I also have enjoyed other versions of it and in fact think the BBC radio broadcast with Denis Quilley is the best, based on a small London production I didn't see.     The film is often beautiful, and the score is orchestrated and performed instrumentally beyond any other version. The actors, most of whom were not chosen for their voices, do act the songs and sing effectively though Helen Bonham Carter is too young, too pretty and as a singer too breathy for Mrs. Lovett, nearly Marilyn Monroe-ish. That part has been played many ways, from Angela Lansbury's hilariously ridiculous middle-class wanna-be to Julia McKenzie's abrasive guttersnipe Lovett with Quilley. Tim Burton's gothic films consistently have the Halloween conceit of dressing up young, pretty actors as ghouls; Johnny Depp transcends this with real weight but for me Carter, Burton's wife, though she does well with what she has, is very miscast. She does add the one really felt element, a quickly discarded concern for the boy they casually adopt. Lansbury did it with one brief look sitting down on stage and silently (which you usually attribute to film acting). Carter gets a big whopping closeup and a few added lines to achieve it.    A note on Depp's technique. Coming to acting as a rock singer, Depp's acting approach is to mimic, much as he surely did trying to find a style to become a rock star. He chooses someone to mimic and model his entire performance on, then riffs. The Rolling Stones have said  Jagger was trying to sound like Muddy Waters and failed badly but that became their signature style. Depp modeled pirate Jack on Keith Richards for instance. Here he models himself on David Bowie; vocally he never transcends the mimicry. It works but for me once I figured this out it was a distraction. Bowie actually would have been an interesting choice for Sweeney; but Russell Crowe and Meryl Streep (who were slated to do it at one time) would have lifted it another level for me. Streep (Mrs. Lovett is supposed to be older, part of the ridiculous romance) would have pulled Depp up another level all by herself. She probably isn't here because she would have been the best thing in it.     I think what Burton really wants to create (and no doubt he's very happy with this film) is silent director Murnau's rich and emotional expressiveness and I wish Murnau (the silent \\"Nosferatu\\" and \\"Faust\\", very much the same mileau as this) was alive to have directed this. With Charlie Chaplin in the lead. I guess if I'm reaching that far back to compare it's an achievement. My problem is with the humor, wit and chorus largely and completely cut (a ghost chorus of Sweeney's victims was abandoned, which I think would have helped) and with the choice to film the brutality straight on with pornographic glee, \\"Sweeney\\" becomes too much (for me) a film of this horrible time. It's an Abu Grab musical, a Dick Cheney musical, a slaughter them before they do it to you musical bromide, a Bushian sociopathic musical. I was always afraid that the real heart of both Sondheim and the work was this gory, dark vicious hatred of all humanity, including himself, and Burton has gone out of his way to expose that truth of Sondheim and himself as well. I suppose it is cathartic, I cried walking home, but I fear it may also carry a contagion, a numbing to gore effect. Which is to say that art at its best is white magic. I think \\"Sweeney\\" isn't. It doesn't respect itself enough to fear its effect; pardon me if I sound like Louis B. Meyer or the Hays office. It doesn't believe in magic of any kind, even as it creates beauty around its own brutality.     Human beings aren't just meat, I'm not and most of the people - not all - I know aren't. Shorn as it is, that is all this \\"Sweeney\\" comes to in the end, like a motto sewn into a pillow. It's grotesquely sad that anyone, much less talents like these, could think we and they are. There is compassion, as the throats were cut (including Michael Palin's if my eyes didn't deceive me) I felt my own slit even though I was just watching light shadows on a wall. A touch of real compassion would level this film a lot.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|It was a quick delivery, as promised.  The product was mailed in a protected and padded envelope and arrived in perfect, sealed condition.  I was excited to finally get it!
0375847227|5.0|I'm generally not a reader and can't remember ever finishing a series of books this fast, but once I started this series I could not put it down.  Religious arguments aside, this is an amazing book and the story is rich and exciting.  I was in no way offended by the content of this fictional tale and will be trying some of Mr. Pullman's other works soon.  I hope they live up to this masterpiece.
B0002VKZTI|3.0|Eumir Deodato may be best known fror producing hit albums for Kool and The Gang in the mid 80's, such as \\"Ladies' Night,\\" \\"Celebration\\" among others.    However, he was also established in the jazz-pop community as well, and Love Island is that hard-to-find gem that those in the know probably spent years searching for in the bins of used record stores.    With cameos by Edwin Starr and Earth, Wind and Fire, the lp is a potpourri of song styles from the credible revamping of \\"Take the A Train,\\" to the solace od \\"Tahiti Hut\\" and \\"San Juan Sunset.\\"    Deodato later came with some uptemp funk classics (Such as 1980's \\"Night Cruiser\\"), but this is his \\"baby\\" so to speak. A nice pick up for those who like their instrumentals mellifluous that are good for relaxation, falling to slkeep or just chilling with a glass of brandy on a rainy day.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I watched this wonderful historical documentary again for the first time in over 30 years.  Originally produced by, I believe, the UK's Thames TV and the Imperial War Museum this masterpiece in documentary still holds up well after all these years.  The 30th Anniversary edition gives you bonus footage with the producers and crew on the making of The World At War.  While it is not all inclusive of everything leading up to and occuring during WWII it comes pretty damn close.  Unlike Victory At Sea's using the war as a backdrop for the musical composition there is a minimum of staged material to be found in The World At War and when it does occur you, the viewer, are given a heads up.  Also, The World At War is much better at telling the story and presenting the drama without all the syrupy sentimentality and political correctness one finds in anything done by Ken Burns, especially his piece done with Lynn Novick, The War.  If The World At War has a fault it tends to, I feel, at times, to over credit the Brits, especially in joint operations.  But this is certainly counterbalanced by is shockingly truthful portrayal of well known British and American Generals, many still living when the series was produced, who still, after 30 years could not admit their own failings.  And the greatest added bonus of all is the priceless narration of all episodes by Sir Laurance Olivier.  This is historical documentary film making at its finest and should be in the library of all students of that period of world history.
0812550706|1.0|In general I was turned off by this book.  In the end, I think it is a child's book.  It was quite easy to read and good enough to fill the time on my flight, but in the end, I was bothered to have read it.  As someone who has experienced sleep deprivation, combat training, science training and much of what described in the book, I just found it pandering.  Perhaps it is because in this age, being able to handle three dimensional thinking and movement and game play just isn't that spectacular.  The world is full of people who spend hours fighting in games on-line and is also full of people who are bright enough to compose these games.  I can't compare this to great writers whose work transcends science or presents philosophical context.  It seems dated and naive in retrospect, but perhaps those who love it simply are impressed by things many now take for granted.  This could be a commentary on the generational seperation in the wired world.

0066620996|4.0|Read this Book if you are ready...to think very differently about your own company.  This is not for the faint of heart.  After reading the mix of solid (sometimes counter-initiative) logic and statistically analyzed support basis, you are forced to examine your own decision making under a microscope.  You might have to rethink your strategy or at least your management approach.    Jim Collins does a great job quantifying organizational success and the factors that help improve the chances.  Although, I believe that predicting success of a company is much akin to meteorology...in most cases there are far too many variables that you can't measure to truly predict the outcome, you can make a statistical model for at least some of the likely influencers.  In very clear terms (with easy to absorb chapters...especially on several train or plane trips) and with constant, relevant examples to draw from, Jim Collins forces you to reexamine your approaches to numerous issues.  You might re-think your organizational structure...eliminating slackers and status-quo employees, decide to stop projects or drop product lines that seemed like good opportunities, or re-align your team's focus towards a goal.    The author doesn't preach from his vast experience in management theory, as with many other \\"Business Help\\" books, but presents logical data analysis from the most successful organizations, during their most thriving periods into useful strategies, applicable at any level of the organization.       This book was either written for you as a CEO, manager or employee...or it was written ABOUT you.  In either case, you had better read it, before your boss does.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I actually bought the BD version of Planet Earth for a friend as part of their xmas present.  I also got them the ps3 to go with it.  Planet Earth is AWESOME.  I watched the whole series on DHD when it was broadcast and pre-ordered the hd-dvd version within 20 minutes of watching the first episode on tv.  It is just flat out, jaw dropping, awesome.   This is my reference DVD for my HD setup here at home.  Anyone that comes by and wants to see 'something good', I show them this.  The reaction is always the same.  The jaw drops and they sit there in amazement.  I suppose if you hate nature / animal type programs, this is not for you.  Otherwise, well worth the price.  Amazon is normally the cheapest place I have seen this set.  I've seen the same sets (bd and hd dvd) ranging from 79 to 99 bucks in the store, and they are worth it at that price.  Getting it through Amaazon and saving a few $$ is just gravy.

0061122416|5.0|I read this book with my book club and I enjoyed it very much.  Initially I felt like I was reading a fairytale and thought that I would not like reading it.  I then looked up information about the book and the definition of what an Alchemist is.  Once I found out that the book is a fable, I began to enjoy it and began to take it seriously.  I think this is because the Author is a very descriptive writer and I lost myself in the book and read it faster than almost any other book from our book club.  I think a lot of people in the book club liked the book. We were left with a lot of questions which made for a good book group discussion.
B000UR9TQO|1.0|As a lifelong Led Zeppelin fan, the proposition of an expanded and remastered Song Remains The Same was very exciting and of course I opted for this, the \\"collectors edition\\" rather than the standard DVD edition and that is where the problems started. First of all I should say that the remastered soundtrack is superb, much better than the original, also some of the extra's are entertaining but hardly essential. My first real disappointment however was with the additional songs; if you have the Led Zeppelin \\"DVD\\" then you pretty much have all the bonus music already and rather than include them in sequence as the band would have played them (as they have done on the audio soundtrack CD), they are just stuck on disc two in no particular order. Now we come to the package...APPALLING BEYOND BELIEF! Firstly the outer box is not even worth keeping, it's like a breakfast cereal carton, really thin. Inside there is a T-Shirt which is the poorest and cheapest quality shirt I've ever seen, it's not even made of cotton, it's some kind of synthetic hybrid which will no doubt last one wash. Now that we have removed the shirt, the DVD's are rolling around inside the breakfast cereal carton, pull them out and they are housed in another thin fold out affair that creases if you breath a little too heavily on it. The discs are accompanied by a handful of pointless postcards with poor quality stills from the film and imitation invites to premiere showings printed on them. To be honest I don't believe that Pagey knows anything about this release, as he is known for his quality control regarding Led Zeppelin's output and I would advise anyone wanting to buy the new version of the film just to get the regular packaged 2 disc set. If you are new to the band, ignore anybody who tells you that this film is self indulgent, these performances while not Zeppelin at their very best, are still a vital document of one of the greatest and most influential bands of all time. Musical content-10/10,this particular DVD package-0/10.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Resurrect the plot of a 1969 Michael Caine movie, recast it with a collection of sharp young actors, and move the action to Los Angeles.  The result is 2003's \\"The Italian Job\\", a fast-paced and enjoyable action thriller.<br /><br />The movie opens with an elaborately-planned heist in Venice, Italy.  A crack crew of thieves goes to Mission: Impossible-like lengths to extract a fortune in gold from a canal-side mansion and escape to the Italian Alps.  There, one of the crew (Edward Norton as a slick and selfish bad guy) betrays the rest, killing the aging master thief (cameo by Donald Sutherland), stealing the gold, and scattering the crew.<br /><br />Fast forward a year.  Charlie Croker, the master thief's protege (played with cool precision by Mark Wahlberg), locates the traitor, living in a fortress mansion in Los Angeles.  He reassembles the team to steal the gold back.  This effort is the heart of the film, as Charlie's team plots their entrance into the mansion and their escape afterward.  The highlight of the movie is a nail-biting chase across Los Angeles, with Charlie's team in specially modified Mini-Coopers and their former teammate in hot pursuit by helicopter.  A tense final confrontation at the Los Angeles train station reveals a few final plot twists.<br /><br />Charlize Theron does an excellent turn as Croker's safe-cracking love interest.  Seth Green is the team's computer whiz and comic relief.  Jason Statham is the team's hunky automotive expert. Mos Def and Franky G have nice supporting roles as additional muscle recruited for the Los Angeles job.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an entertaining action thriller.  This DVD version includes some nice extras on the making of the movie, to include how the amazing Mini-Cooper stunts were performed.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|My wife loves fantasy movies.  And I don't mean just the kind where there is a lot of betrayal, mixed conflicts, and has one of those Harlequin Romance novel covers.  Anything else, she loves.  When I first saw ads coming out for Stardust, I could only think about how my wife would want to see it.  I didn't really have an interest.  Then we went to see it.  And I changed my mind.    Stardust was a fresh zephyr in a summer where I thought only epic movies involving teenage wizards and forty-meter robots would prevail.  Stardust is chock full of laughs, giggles, snickers and full throttle snorts.  Teeming with an infestation of additude, sarcasm, and subtlety, Stardust kept me interested enough to pay to see it in the theatre a second time.  And for what I was getting out it, I think I got a good deal.  I almost wish it had never come to home video, so that the full effect of how much fun it could be to watch a fantasy film would be retained.  Stardust nearly makes a simplistic mockery of it's epic counterparts, bowing away from the high-dramaticism, using visuals that aren't only rarely used anymore, but also cleverly applied.    The richness (or outrageousness, whichever you prefer) of the characters creates a dynamic strength that will not be soon forgotten.  I can't wait to see what this studio has next in line.

0307387151|5.0|This book evoked layers of response from me.  Appropriately so, since it is a novel operating on a number of levels, some of them not apparent until the very end. \\"Atonement\\" reflects life itself in all its complexity and seeming contradictions, as a great novel should.    Firstly, it is a novel about a novelist, Briony, and the way she   matures at a critical time in her life.  This permits the reader to see how Mc Ewan links an author's psychological and spiritual growth with the process of creating literature.    Mc Ewan uses the device of a publishers' thoughtful rejection letter to take a polite swipe at favorite authors such as Woolf and Joyce. The publisher suggests that exquisite renderings of either stream of consciousness or the external world do not suffice to make a great novel .  In order to give the novel  \\"back bone\\" and to fully engage the reader, the author needs to provide a plot.    What the letter doesn't mention, and is left for Mc Ewan to demonstrate and the reader to notice, is that plot development serves as a vehicle for character development.  The attendant events of our lives shape us and we shape our lives.  This interactional balance underlies human reality and great novels reflect it. In that way they differ from short stories, fairy tales, or simple narratives.     Secondly, Mc Ewan uses an important psychological revelation that Briony experiences as a means of structuring the novel.  That revelation is that we all think ourselves unique, and all have our own particular take on any interpersonal situation.  This multi-subjective aspect of reality is incorporated by Mc Ewan through his having us see the world sequentially through the lens of each of the three major characters.    The challenge then facing the author, and indeed all of us, is that given the universal illusion of individual hyper-importance, how do we grow beyond that perspective and arrive at one that both encompasses and transcends our individuality.    Thirdly, in theDunkirk sequence of the novel, we are thrown into   a modern version of the Greek myths of War and the Hero's Journey.    Like Ulysses, Robin is determined to return home from the war to Cecilia, his Penelope. He shows persistence, learns to value his comrades, and exhibits courage.  All these heroic traits help him survive the ordeal.  But mortals are subject to the whims of the Gods.  Thus chance is also woven into the narrative, as it is in all our lives.    Robin is spared, while a mother and son he tries to save from death are not, for no apparent reason. That integral part of our existence, the dance between will and chance, is nowhere more apparent than in  this section of the book.    Finally, in the very last section of the book, wherein the author Briony speaks directly to us, the readers, McEwan presents the archetypal author as a kind of God who arbitrarily fabricates and destroys vivid characters..  Some of them possess a kind of immortality.  Anna Karenina; Raskolnikov; Orlando; are a few that come to mind.     Who then is more lasting and in some way realer, the fictional person or the reader?    I found \\"Atonement\\" not only an engaging \\"hard-to-put-down\\" read,  but also a book offering profound insights into what it takes to be an outstanding novelist.  I highly recommend it for all those who like an exciting story and are interested in how literature is created.
B00008972S|4.0|you can't appreciate this musical in a full screen format...you just can't...that's why it was shot in widescreen..to take advantage of the angles for the wonderfully vibrant dance sequences.

B000Y179KO|4.0|I guess I just have to laugh at people who are ranting about the Eagles having a political viewpoint and putting that viewpoint in their music.  I guess they are either to young to remember the roots of rock and roll, or just have very selective memories.  If they were around in the 60's and 70's they must have hated songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Graham Nash, Neil Young, and quite a few others.  Have they also forgotten Joan Baez, and all the folk music groups that grew into rock and roll singing all those anti-war songs and political protest songs?  Music has always been political because it expresses human emotions and ideas, and politics definitely drives volatile human emotions.  That hasn't changed, and to expect it to is an unreasonable expectation.     As for music, I've always liked music with a message.  I don't always agree with Eagles politically or their choices of solutions to problems, but they are right on the money when they blast American society for having such a huge sense of entitlement, and putting monetary values over what's good, right, and will benefit society as a whole and in the long run.  Being against the sense of entitlement that permeates our society is actually a pretty conservative viewpoint, not extreme left wing politics.    I buy an Eagles album to hear \\"Eagles music\\", not to hear something I won't recognize.  Those people saying that the entire album sucks because it's just a replay of the Eagles former sounds, but really praise \\"Last Good Time in Town\\" as being original haven't listened to solo albums from Joe Walsh, or once again have short memories.  That song is as \\"typical\\" Joe Walsh as you can get from start to finish.  I hear many traces of \\"The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get\\" in his songs on this album, and that album is from the early 70's.  He's always only had one style, and his music has always had the same sound.  He didn't change that on this album in the least, other than to tone down how hard core his musicalways was, and that's a good thing.  He wouldn't sound like Joe Walsh if he did, and I like Joe Walsh's sound.  I like the Eagles' sound too, and this album is most definitely Eagles' music.

B000VWYJ8Q|3.0|As in all my reviews, I'm reviewing the disc quality of video and extras.  But, sometimes I will make an acception.  If I had to rate the movie out of 5, I will give it a 3.  That is because this movie is the direct copy to \\"Bourne Supremacy\\".  Some scenes were exactly the same, even the angle of the camera was the same.  Now, I know it's based on the book, but.... that what does that say about the book?  Anywayz, to the quality of the disc.<br /><br />I like the Video quality, it's very crisp clear in some scenes, especially wide shots of all the cities.  Handles the brightness levels during the night scenes very nicely.  Handles the contrast very well as well, and the colors are not that bad.<br /><br />But, man, the thing that SUCKS about HD-DVD's are the loading time, because it's trying to connect to the Internet every time I pop in the disc, and that could take up to a minute.  That's really annoying.<br /><br />And OH MY GOD, WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE COMBO DISCS????????  I don't care about SD anymore, I didn't buy an HD player to pay more for HD-DVD/DVD combos.  Plus, I HATE WITH ALL MY MIGHT double sided CD's, they are annoying.  I like to have the pic from the film or a nice design on the CD.<br /><br />That is why this version of the film is mark down, the video and sound is good (not great), but the load time and combo are freakin annoying.

B000VDDDY6|5.0|This is an idea long overdue.  I've heard and read criticisms of the digitial enhancments from many of the purists, but I am quite sure Gene himself would approve of the changes made.  Many of the scenes added are stunning, and my favorite episode, The Doomsday Machine, needed this badly.  In some ways, I feel the CGI was too conservative.  For instance, I would have enjoyed seeing something on the overhead bridge monitors other than stock footage, perhaps Hubble images or computer graphics.  I've waited a long time for this, and get to enjoy these episodes anew, looking for scenes that weren't there before.
B0000DETET|4.0|A good album to have to understand where Death/Black metal(or thrash) began. A fairly solid album at the time it can wear on todays listener who expects everthing to be perfect because between the semi decent songs, lyrics, and instument playing many may feel this is what Satan will play for them when they arrive in HELL!! However, the extreme RAWNESS of this album will work for the rest of us who miss the days of non perfect/WHERE THE HELL IS THE SINGLES THAT WILL SELL MILLIONS FOR US RECORD/PIG COMPANIES. Thank fully VENOM came around when a band was expected to be different not some perfect kissass like many of todays band.
B000001ESF|5.0|What a classic rock album, one of the best in my opinion.  There is not a bad song on the entire album.  I listened to this album when I was a kid, of course it was on vinyl, but the sound was still incredible!!  If you like wicked guitar and guitar solos, then this is a  must!  Ya, Geddy Lee has a bit of a high tone voice, but he still sounds pretty sweet!!  If you read this, another great song Rush put out was \\"Working Man\\".  Not sure what album, but it has one of the best guitar solos ever!!  I wish they had put that song on Rock Band instead of Tom Sawyer, and by all means, I'm not saying Tom Sawyer is a bad song in any way, \\"Working Man\\" is just better.  Rush 2112, one of their finest albums ever!!
B00000JY1X|5.0|This album is one of the better alternative albums of the 90's and it showcases not only the wonderful songwriting abilities of Stephin Merritt, but the wonderful blending of the breaking indie music scene at the time as well as the classic Magnetic Fields synth-pop sound. The album has very unconventional instruments used and a few special guest singers (like on \\"Long-Forgotten Fairytale\\" \\"All My Little Words\\" \\"Come Back from San Francisco\\" etc.). The albums central theme is all love songs (hence the title) and is by far the most diverse collection done by the Magnetic Fields to date. My personal favorite is Disc 3 but all discs have their highlights. Definately a great buy for any fans of the Magnetic Fields.

First and foremost, those who read the book will be VERY disappointed like i did... if not you will enjoy it very much. the CGI/special effects/ make up are quite good though is not top notch as supposed to be. the plot and setting (amazingly done by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess) in the book diserved better treatement in the \\"visual category\\" since this, along with the author, is what attract people to read it and eventually see the movie. i have to watch it again and again to have a better grasp of it without trying not to have in mind the book itself. is understandable that to do a movie out of a novel is very difficult because of the limited budget and time... so that is why a lot of stuff has to be compressed in order to satisfied this elements (this also goes for almost all movies-out-of-novels). but IMO the plot could have been a bit paced out better.    But... the basic most important thing that is nowhere to be found in the movie was the mythical creatures that where all over the book... this was what dissapoint me the most :-/. they didn't put effort and time to present the land of Faerie... only the Stormhold kingdom (vissually beautifull but not the same). it lacks the ethereal atmosphere that makes Faerie what it is... even the character of Yvaine(fallen star), play awfully by Claire Danes, doesn't look ethereal... she is the same as the other characters though sometimes gleams but only when she is happy. Faeries, Gnomes, Trolls, Giants, Wyverns, Dragons etc etc... where are they??... not even one appears in the movie :-<. this is one part that i thought it would have been presented in detail in the movie... apparently they didn't look at the illustrations of the book... or they lack imagination, jeje.    The characters were quite good. the only one, IMO, that pull it through very convincingly was Michelle Pfeiffer as Liam, the witch queen. Also as well were the prince brothers, specially Septimus... they looksomewhat like the illustrations. Tristran, Yvaine and the other characters were of the bunch... lacking some prescence.    Captain Shakespeare??... WTF!!!    Aside all this I enjoy it at the end... its fun to watch and more if you like fantasy as me :-).    Recommended for people who likes fantasy/adventure/drama... but not for those who have  read the book.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|This is by far the best of the Die Hard Series and the best graphics, Car chase action, Great Film, Bruce Willis comes through again...
B000N6U1GE|5.0|I don't know French but this is one of my favorites of her. The sounds and the voice are just amazing. I don't mind that I don't understand it as long as her voice is great as usual.
6305972591|3.0|\\"...but it's safe.\\" is how the rest of the line goes.  But when the film begins with the slaughtering of adults in a small Nebraska town by all the children, it's far from that.  Children of the Corn is a unique horror film in that it blends children and cornfields, but other than that, this is a pretty lame and average scarefest.<br /><br />Gatlin is the small Nebraska town where the action takes place.  Gatlin is now a ghost town, because the adults are \\"in the cornfields\\".  In other words, sacrificed by the orders of \\"Isaac\\" (John Franklin) the leader of the strange cult consisting of all children 18 years and younger.  Isaac teaches what he sees from the Bible, and even the assumption we get that the film's main character Burt is weary of Christianity, he still points out that these events are ridiculous and obsured.<br /><br />Burt and Vicky are the unlucky young adults who travel through Gatlin, and end up getting trapped there due to roadsigns that have been misplaced to keep outlanders stuck.  Obviously, since the town is dry of adults, the children are always looking for visitors to sacrifice.  The majority of the film is slow paced, though mildly entertaining with suspense and chases.  The blood and gore factor is actually quite minimal, and nothing compared to today's standards.  Most of the time, the camera will pull away before someone is murdered.<br /><br />The characters in this film are primarily the children and the two young adults.  Only Isaac and his henchman Malachai stood out with the most interest, looking and talking with decent intimidation, but in the end their lack of acting (as well as everyone else) keeps things at bay.  Horror movies aren't usually known for good acting, but this is below those standards.<br /><br />Overall, the film has some originality to it and is worth a look, though its more of a way to kill 90 minutes it would seem.  It scares a bit here and there for the most part.  Apparently, though, someone liked it since it spawned 7 more sequals, though none of those really improved over this.<br /><br />Acting - 2<br />Characters - 3<br />Horror - 3<br />Story - 3.5<br />Overall - 3.5gh none of those really improved over this.    Acting - 2  Characters - 3  Horror - 3  Story - 3.5  Overall - 3.5
B000NA28A2|2.0|Didn't like this album. Totally hated \\"La Llave De Mi Corazon\\" it sounded like the song you would hear on a Burger King commercial. Why add the english lyrics? There is no need for it. I'm totally disappointed and deleting from my iPod. Get all of his previous material, because it's really world class.
1401384854|4.0|This book does a good job of analyzing the problems besetting a peace time army thrown into combat without proper training and with questionable leadership.
0440419514|1.0|I bought this before I realized that the author had publicly stated that the goal of his books is to teach children that there is no God. I think it is awful to bury a message like that in a children's book. Parents should be aware that he describes these books as being about \\"killing God.\\" If you don't believe me, Google it. I didn't believe it at first either.
B000W4HJ44|1.0|The first disc of the Two-Disc Shake and Shimmy Edition will not load properly.  The second one does. Experienced this with 2 different DVD machines.    Could get the first disc to load to a Wwindows XP machine DVD, but performance was very poor and machine eventually hung.  Tried using the advanced features which did not work.  The 'advanced features' and performed unauthorized installs/changes to the XP machine.  Had to use Norton GoBack to restore functionality and remove changes.    Doesn't Newline recall what Sony was sued over?  You can't install / change peoples machines without their permission! I  guess they just don't care.    Too bad because I was looking forward to the DVD.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I was surprised to find both the colorised & black and white versions be sold together! I have loved this movie since I was a child and have watched every year since I was a teenager. The shopping & shipping for this DVD was easy as pie!!

B000A2XC1C|5.0|I love this movie because it helps to explain so many things about Santa. I watch it aleast once a season if not more. When my kids were little they also loved it, and still do. Some how it makes you feel like a little kid again, with all the excitement of the holliday all over again!  The shopping & shipping were easy as pie. I couldn't have finished my Christmas shopping any other way. I intend to do some more shopping on this site after the hollidays.
6302000823|5.0|This movie made me think what's more important: Love or career success. Was Alfredo a good man or a bad man? why did he want salvatore to travel and have a successful life. What about love and happiness in his life. The music is wonderful.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|Linda Perhacs 1970 album \\"Parallelograms\\" stands as one of the great lost treasures of the singer/songwriter boom of the early 1970s. Described by [[ASIN:0879305347 Richie Unterberger]] as one of the best lost folk-rock albums of its era, \\"Parallelograms\\" is actually quite different from anything in the genre. With its instrumentation of acoustic guitar backed up by percussion, horns, harmonica and a limited amount of electric guitar and bass, \\"Parallelograms\\" sounds more like [[ASIN:B0000067X1 Can]] minus the electronics than anything singers like Joni Mitchell or Judee Sill were producing at the time. In places, like on the beautiful, yet touching title track, it actually sounds truly ambient, yet when I heard this in a local record store after buying it, I felt quite shocked!<br /><br />The opener \\"Chicamum Rain\\" is quiet and touching, but the second track \\"Paper Mountain Man\\", with its assertive vocal and cerebral lyrics satirising hippie culture, is one of the true lost wonders of the 1970s. The way in which a harmonica blends with the guitars and percussion rather than act as a solo instrument is surprising, and Perhacs' delivery was surely the most assertive statement by any woman in rock to that point. \\"Dolphins\\", \\"Call of the River\\" and \\"Sandy Toes\\" return to the ambient sound of the opening track and back it up with beautiful poetry of greater literacy than anything coming from female singer/songwriters of the time. Nonetheless, the title tune, a multi-part piece despite being only four-and-a-half minutes long, is even better. Perhacs manages to make music that truly sound like later \\"new age\\" without becoming in any way soppy: even the truly ambient middle part has great energy due to the deep breathing from the saxophone.<br /><br />\\"Moons and Cattails\\", besides having some superb poetry (\\"the soaking taste of leaves/the cooling memory of shadows\\"), manages to combine the two approaches on \\"Parallelograms\\" into one tightly knit song with a quite unique sound. The flute at the beginning has a quite echo-like sound but is still clearly a flute, whilst the power of the dense guitar line exceeds almost anything from the era. The long fermatas in Perhacs' voice add to the experience further. \\"Porcelain Baked Cast Iron Wedding\\" highlights the more assertive side of Perhacs, whilst \\"Morning Colours\\" has many unexpected turns amidst its quiet tone. \\"Delicious\\" is poetry at its purest - poetry that really rhymes - and with Perhacs' beautiful yet deep at sometimes haunting voice, the chorus expresses sensual desire like a true poem should.<br /><br />The bonus track \\"If You Were My Man\\" is very different from anything on the original album with its eerie piano sound, but does fit with the ambient sound of the record as a whole. Perhacs also showed herself a very versatile singer with her quiet tones contrasting with \\"Paper Mountain Man\\" is a surprising way.<br /><br />Although a challenging work compared to, say, Judee Sill, Essra Mohawk or even Laura Nyro at her most challenging, \\"Parallelograms\\" is undoubtedly unique among the singer/songwriter gems of the early 1970s. With two of the finest songs from that era (\\"Paper Mountain Man\\", \\"Moons and Cattails\\") a unique, ambient sound and some of the most cerebral poetry from any female singer/songwriter, \\"Parallelograms\\" is a lost gem that deserves the attention of serious music fans.at the beginning has a quite echo-like sound but is still clearly a flute, whilst the power of the dense guitar line exceeds almost anything from the era.

0321334876|5.0|This is a great book which covers a lot of useful topics for every C++ professional.  I have been programming in C++ for a while so some of the topics Scott Mayers discussed were already familiar but I still picked up a lot from this book.  From a beginner to intermediate programmer, this is a must have.  Advanced programmers probably have this book already (or its previous editions).      This book assumes that you already used C++ and understand its fundamentals.  Scott's goal is not to teach the fundamentals but to advice readers on how to use the language effectively - generating good, efficient, re-usable, portable code. On this goal, he was successful.  Its pretty much like when I was learning Japanese. I understood the fundamentals and word translations but in order to effectively communicate in that language, I had to be familiar with proper sentence construction, various formalities (some words are not appropriate for certain settings or people) and word dynamics as well. In a sense, this book (or Scott) is your sensei to good C++ programming.    Some more suggested reading to complement Scott Mayer's series:  [[ASIN:0201633612 Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series)]]  and   [[ASIN:0201704315 Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied (C++ In-Depth Series)]]
0440238609|5.0|These stories are a true delight.  Anyone who whines about them, has not read them.  Yes, they do speak of killing a fake god who stands in God's stead.  Why are the Christian right ruffled by this?  Perhaps they, too, are fake gods, standing in the place of the real God.

B000U1ZV3U|4.0|Excellent Picture, definetely could tell the difference between bluray and Dvd  but it lacks in audio, it isnt digital.  otherwise excellent product. I am a huge fan of westerns and recently some westerns are worth watching in the HD or Bluray format, check out other titles like Unforgiven, Once upon a time in the west, and other John Wayne Classics which look totally breathtaking and phenomenal.
B00005JLCI|5.0|In the past, I've seen several versions of Hamlet. Even though I have not seen them all, I say with confidence that Kenneth Branagh's version is the best.  He is not a mere actor in this well-made movie, he is Hamlet and Hamlet  is playing him instead of him playing Hamlet. It is so easy to believe that Hamlet was as Kenneth Branagh represents him in his movie. His body language, his facial expressions, his sensitivity, his deep beautiful emotional noble honorable soul and  his tone of voice couldn't be anything but Hamlet the noble prince of Denmark .Since I am not an expert on movie making, my comments on the way the movie was made ( big screen, great actors, the use of mirrors, the location and the time period) would not be very accurate. Nevertheless, from the point of view of a layman, everything was very well done. The only thing that did not fit in the movie was the choice of the actress on Ophelia. One expects for Ophelia to be more plain, young and innocent. Kate Winslet appears like a young woman who is very feminine and not a young girl who is plain and in a sense naive.  I waited for a long time for Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet to be released on DVD. This movie is one that I'll treasure and watch over and over. As said in the special features,\\"nobody has done the movie like this before and nobody is going to do it again.\\"
B0000942FL|4.0|This is better than Green Day's Dookie, Incubus' first 3 CDs (the putrid Fungus Amongus, overrated to the High Heavens, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and the sporadically magical Make Yourself).

B0000VD04M|5.0|Tim Burton is truly a genius and an amazing director. Any fan of his should see this film. Not only is it based on a true story of director Ed Wood, but the way the story was written and filmed brings a classic and humorous way to film making. The cast is amazing!

B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I had the great honor of attending a full dress rehearsal of A New Day a week before the show opened - 7th row center. This was actually the performance that was televised (in part) on opening night, March 27th 2003.  It was nothing short of AMAZING!!!  Being a full dress rehearsal where the show producers were still deciding which acts would stay and which acts would have to be cut due to time constraints of the actual show we were treated to a much longer version with acts that have never been done for the general public.  What a rare gift!      I also had opening night tickets for myself and my family. Again AMAZING.  Living in Las Vegas, I've had the pleasure of seeing the show three more times since then (a total of 5 times over the past 5 years).  The last show I saw was December 8th, 2007 - closing week. Each of the five shows has been a bit different with different costumes and different staging for most of the numbers.  And each show has been wonderful- so full of energy, heart and immense talent!  As I watch the DVD, I can tell by the costumes that the show was videotaped sometime in the past year so it's very current.     With that background, I can tell you without hesitation, this DVD set is INCREDIBLE!  While obviously not the same as being in the audience, they producers have done a wonderful job of capturing the total show and the impact of it all.  It would be impossible to capture everything that's happening on stage, all of the dancers, the \\"sets\\", the cinematography on the GIGANTIC LCD screen in the background, the flying instruments ... there is so much happening on and above the huge stage that a camera is incapable of completely capturing it all.  However, the director, cameramen and technicians have done a remarkable job of capturing as much as humanly possible and bringing the at-home audience a BETTER THAN first rate experience.      The \\"extras\\" on the DVD are wonderful as well.  The viewer is taken on a limo ride with Celine and Renee, from their home in Lake Las Vegas to the theatre and the dressing room.  You have an intimate look at what goes into preparing for the show and what goes on back stage.  While our Star is on stage singing her heart out, you have a look at the other performers as they prepare for their roles.  It's a very interesting and enjoyable look into the reality of the production and see the dedication, talent and pure heart of all involved!     More bonus features take you back to the beginning - from inspiration to creation.  You hear from Franco Dragone.  You learn about the auditions of the cast.  You get a glimpse of Celine meeting her cast members for the first time.  Watch as the theatre is built and the show evolves from inspiration to actualization.  And so much more.  Very interesting and even inspirational.    I absolutely LOVE this DVD set and highly recommend it!  If you've never had the thrill of attending this show, you owe it to yourself to experience it through the DVD.  If you have had the privilege of seeing the show, you'll love reliving the experience over and over again as well as watching the bonus features.  STANDING OVATION for this DVD set... BRAVO - WELL DONE!
B00006G8HX|4.0|This is a very good movie and a little on the light hearted side which is ok, the story is very good and it was a very good way to bring Spock back.  My only complaint about this movie are that Kirsty Alley was replaced by Robin Curtis.  They should have paid Kirsty Alley the money she wanted because Robin Curtis was not very good at all.   I'm sorry she was very bad and it is painful to look at her act when she is on the screen. Now on the other hand Christoper Lloyd is the best Klingon I have ever seen and plays the role very very well.  This film is in no way near the best of the Star Trek films but it is a decent one and worth watching and having in your collection.  There are some very memorible moments in this film like Uhura dealing with the young ensign in the transporter room, and Kirk's fight with the Klingon.  Add this one to your collection it is enjoyable to watch from time to time.
B000VECAEO|5.0|While I believe this is not the show's premier season, it completes the set and has some classic episodes. The same product you'd get anywhere, Amazon just sells it cheaper w/ free shipping.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Finally a real movie, about real people, with a real message for our times!  Amazing Grace shows how one man can make a great difference for the better, in his country and in God's world.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|Not one for fantasy type movies, I watched this movie only because my boyfriend wanted to see it.  May I jsut say that I am so glad I did.  This movie instantly became one of my favorite movies.  I actually watched it a second time right after I got done watching it.  Set in England in a small town named \\"Wall\\", this movie transports the viewer into a magical world or witches and unicorns, and where fallen stars look like humans.  The ghosts in the movie are quite entertaining and Rupert Everett was completely unreconnizable for me.  My favorite part of the movie was just about any scene with Robert DeNiro, the \\"scary\\" Captain Shakespeare.  Full of action, romance, humor, and fantasy, this is a fairy tales like story meant for adults with wonderful dry British humor.  This movie has elements for everyone and is a movie NOT to be missed!
1400062756|5.0|This is a fascinating book.  The author develops a simple psychological theory of mindsets.  Mindsets represent one's beliefs about self and others.  You have either a fixed-mindset or a growth-mindset.  The fixed-mindset entails human capabilities are predetermined by inborn talent.  And, there is not a whole lot one can do about it.  The growth-mindset entails capabilities result from practicing and learning.  And, there is no predictable limit to what you can achieve.<br /><br />This mindset model is at the foundation of Nature vs Nurture argument with the [[ASIN:0684824299 Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (A Free Press Paperbacks Book)]] and [[ASIN:0275961036 The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability (Human Evolution, Behavior, and Intelligence)]] on one side and [[ASIN:055338371X Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ]], [[ASIN:0465025102 Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences]], and [[ASIN:0471699772 IQ: A Smart History of a Failed Idea]] on the other.  These are all excellent books by the way that enrich one's perspective on this debate with no finish line.<br /><br />The mindsets have also a physiological basis.  When you learn, the brain physically does grow new connections (synapses).  The author states by just showing a simple video (Brainology) that explains this working of the brain to students, it puts them readily into a growth mindset.<br /><br />Out of her binomial model (you have either a growth- or fixed-mindset), the author develops a broad set of applications.  Mindsets have huge influence on outcome in every human endeavor.  The author unveils studies analyzing the performance of kindergarten pupils, college students, scientists, artists, athletes, coaches, parents, and CEOs.  In each case, the outcome is the same.  The individuals with a growth-mindset fulfill their potential and learn better.  They love what they are doing, and work hard at it.  See also [[ASIN:0060920432 Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience]] to fully understand love of effort.  Meanwhile, the opposite is true for the fixed-mindset.  They don't fulfill their potential, and they are often miserable.  They view scores, victories, grades more than actual understanding and learning.  Ultimately, their performance suffers because they don't hone their foundation through perseverance that allows for true growth.  Talent is not everything.<br /><br />Some of the mentioned experiments are amazing.  Simply by suggesting a different mindset atmosphere (growth- or fixed-) before the start of an experiment among two different groups, the growth-mindset group invariably outperforms the fixed-mindset one.  Here we are just talking of a temporary practiced culture.  We are not even talking about the natural mindset of the individuals!<br /><br />Mindsets are pretty liquid.  Few of us have truly one type or another.  You'll find that you have one type at work, but maybe a different type when it comes to social and emotional domains.  When you were in school you may have been one type for a given subject and another type for another one.  The author mentions how pre-med students are ultimately tested by chemistry.  She found that fixed-minded students often hit the wall with chemistry and end up giving up on pre-med studies.  Meanwhile, growth-minded students keep on trucking.  I know firsthand what that was like.  When reading the book, you will most probably relate to dozens of examples and find that your own mindset is different depending on the domain.  It is also different depending on phase of life, situation, and age.<br /><br />The author makes a lot of fascinating comparisons.  She contrasts John McEnroe, Tiger Woods, and Michael Jordan.  In her view, Mac is a fixed-mind set guy.  It is all about talent.  Practice is for common mortals.  Meanwhile, Tiger and Michael are all about practice and constant improvement.  Obviously, these two fulfilled their potentials.  McEnroe did not fulfill his full potential.  If he had, he could have been included in the conversation of being one of the best ever.  He is not.<br /><br />The author also contrasts CEOs such as Jack Welch (GE) and Lou Gerstner on the growth-mind side vs Jeffrey Skilling (Enron) and Lee Iacocca (Chrysler) on the fixed-mind one.  As expected, the first two were successful and left a great legacy.  The other two failed because of their fixed mindset that prevented them from ever learning.  They thought they were always right.  Thus, they and their companies could never self-correct, and learn from mistakes.  On the other hand, Jack Welch and Lou Gerstner were quick in recognizing mistakes and implementing strategies to correct them.  In this section, she often refers to the findings in [[ASIN:0066620996 Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't]].<br /><br />The author uncovers the danger of success.  Her studies have shown that when kids are praised for their intelligence when they get good grades, it readily puts them into a fixed mindset.  They become risk averse, and learning impaired because they interpret any setback as a permanent label that they are not smart anymore.  If kids are praised for their effort, they become natural learners taking on challenges readily.  That's the growth mindset.  We are all vulnerable to the praises no matter how old.  The praises can come from our own bosses, colleagues, spouses, or even the marketplace.  The minute we believe we are gifted, we are vulnerable to fall into a fixed mindset and forego the practice that got us there.<br /><br />This book acts as a follow up to many excellent books about self actualization such as: [[ASIN:0679778314 The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance]], and [[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]].  But, analytically her work goes much beyond.  And, her analysis has very strong empirical evidence.  Contrary to what another reviewer suggests, the latter book does not contradict this one.  Whatever endeavor you undertake, you are bound to enjoy it and learn it better with a growth mindset.  This does not contradict that you should also uncover your specific talents and focus on those to become successfull.e had, he could have been included in the conversation of being one of the best ever.  He is not.    The author also contrasts CEOs such as Jack Welch (GE) and Lou Gerstner on the growth-mind side vs Jeffrey Skilling (Enron) and Lee Iacocca (Chrysler) on the fixed-mind one.

Her studies have shown that when kids are praised for their intelligence when they get good grades, it readily puts them into a fixed mindset.  They become risk averse, and learning impaired because they interpret any setback as a permanent label that they are not smart anymore.  If kids are praised for their effort, they become natural learners taking on challenges readily.  That's the growth mindset.  We are all vulnerable to the praises no matter how old.  The praises can come from our own bosses, colleagues, spouses, or even the marketplace.  The minute we believe we are gifted, we are vulnerable to fall into a fixed mindset and forego the practice that got us there.    This book acts as a follow up to many excellent books about self actualization such as: [[ASIN:0679778314 The Inner Game of Tennis: The Classic Guide to the Mental Side of Peak Performance]], and [[ASIN:0743201140 Now, Discover Your Strengths]].  But, analytically her work goes much beyond.  And, her analysis has very strong empirical evidence.  Contrary to what another reviewer suggests, the latter book does not contradict this one.  Whatever endeavor you undertake, you are bound to enjoy it and learn it better with a growth mindset.  This does not contradict that you should also uncover your specific talents and focus on those to become successfull.
B000710KU2|5.0|I just dug my old copy of Mr. Brown Can Moo out of my fathers basement from the 1970's for MY 2 year old son.  What memories it brings back and my son loves it too.  When I heard my father reading it to my son the other day, I could hear my father reading it to me 32 years ago.
1594489505|5.0|Wonderful book. He is probably the most vivid writer I have read. I would highly recommend this book, depressing but good.
0061122416|5.0|This is one of those books that took my beath away over and over.  It is so thoughtfully and intellegently written.  I wished I could store all of it's many thought provoking segments into my long term memory forever.  It really spoke to me.  This is one book to keep on your bookshelf over the ages and re-read over every so often.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|... attack ships on fire off the Shoulder of Orion.<br /><br />I watched c-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh&auml;user Gate.<br /><br />And I've seen the ultimate presentation of \\"Blade Runner\\".<br /><br />\\"Blade Runner\\" has always been one of my three favorite movies (the other two being Ridley Scott's other masterpiece, \\"Alien\\", and James Cameron's \\"Aliens\\"). The very first DVD I bought back in 1997, before I even owned a DVD player, was \\"Blade Runner\\"; it was my litmus test to see if this new DVD movie format was any good. And boy-oh-boy, was it ever. But over time, the original \\"Blade Runner\\" DVD has really shown its age. It had no extras, terrible picture quality compared to current DVDs, and inferior sound.<br /><br />So now we have the HD-DVD Ultimate Collector's Edition of \\"Blade Runner\\". I could write a magnum opus about everything that is good about this set, but I just want to concentrate on the really, really important stuff.<br /><br />First, the picture and sound quality is simply amazing. The entire film has been remastered in 4K and 8K high-definition, and every frame painstakingly cleaned of dust and scratches. The result is a totally immersive cinematic experience that looks as good now as when the movie was first released in 1982 (it may even be better). Simply breathtakingly good.<br /><br />Second, CGI and reshoots have been used to clean up all of the niggly little mistakes that have been in the movie all of these years. Wires holding up the spinners, the obvious stuntwoman when Zhora crashes through the glass, Deckard's mouth not matching his spoken words when talking to Abdul Ben Hassan, the wrong cityscape when the dove takes off, the finger on Batty's shoulder when he's in the Vid-Phon booth. All of these, and more, have been fixed, absolutely seamlessly.<br /><br />And finally, the continuity errors that plagued previous releases have all been corrected. For example, now there were TWO replicants that got fried running through an electrical field, so the numbers through the rest of the movie all make sense.<br /><br />The result of all of this is that the best SF movie ever, and one of the best overall movies ever, is now as close to perfect as it's ever going to get.<br /><br />Add to all of that the 4 OTHER versions of the movie, including the legendary Workprint; all of the supplemental materials, deleted scenes, documentaries; and the cool toys in the box.<br /><br />This set is absolutely worth buying. I'd give it 6 stars if the system would let me.all make sense.    The result of all of this is that the best SF movie ever, and one of the best overall movies ever, is now as close to perfect as it's ever going to get.

B00005TT77|4.0|I thought it was cool to hear other artist's takes on some of the most popular Beatles songs. They were covered, without being buried.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|This movie is silly fun.  As always, Bruce Willis delivers a good performance.  The film's sidekick, the \\"Mac Guy\\" from TV is also enjoyable to watch--the perfect nerd.

B000V86OKG|4.0|LAST SEASON ON DEXTER:  Just to bring you up to speed, you really must catch last season, but for those who insist on jumping to S2, a recap:  We meet Dexter Morgan, affable man-about-sin city (Miami).  A professional analyst for Miami homicide detectives, Dexter moonlights as a not-so-mild mannered serial killer himself.  His victims are criminals themselves - murderers who have slipped through the fingers of sloppy detectives and prosecutors.  While Dex brings a rarified sense of justice to both of his occupations, we are also told that Dexter's homicidal tendencies are more instinct than vindictive - Dex is driven to kill, and Miami's stock of untouchable murderers keeps him at saw's length from the rest of us.  No one suspects that Dex is responsible for a one-man murder wave - Dexter is well able to hide the evidence that a serial killer is on the loose (at least in S1).  Even the women in his life - his angelic girlfriend Rita, and his potty-mouthed sister Deborah - are fooled.  Only Harry Morgan, his loving, adoptive father, understands what Dexter is capable of.  A decorated detective, Captain Morgan schooled Dexter in the ways of uncatchable killers - creating \\"The Code of Harry\\".  However, Dexter soon finds himself competing with a horrific serial killer who uses flash-freezing to reduce his victims to broken shapes looking like broken dolls.  Dubbed \\"The Ice Truck Killer\\", the mystery man not only eludes the police, but soon homes in on Dexter - our hero's secret is not well kept.  Far from feeling terrified, Dexter welcomes the homicidal companionship, and homes in on ITK not so much to apprehend him as to better understand himself.    TONIGHT ON DEXTER:  \\"It's going to happen again\\", Dexter narrates, much as he did in the last season's premier.  Only now, things have changed.  Unlike other shows that build up the pressure, then end with some closure, the opener manages to pick up where last season's finale left off.  Both Dexter and Deb are emotionallyscarred in learning ITK's true identity.  Worse, in pursuing ITK alone, Dexter has attracted the attentions of Detective=Sergeant Doakes, an Army Special Forces Vet with his own killer instincts.  Openly hostile to Dexter, Doakes now has a reason to hunt him down.  And worst of all, Scuba divers in Bay Harbour locate an undersea graveyard - we know it as Dexter's dumping ground, but for everybody else, it's both the sign of a serial killer even worse than ITK and an SOS to federal authorities that Dexter can't end-run.  Dexter struggles to navigate both Feds and Doakes but, finally getting the chance for blood, finds he can't quite...rise to the occasion.  Things are also tricky with Rita, who suspects Dexter of railroading her ex-con husband back to jail on a parole violation.  There's also the romantic entanglements of Lila, a dark-minded artist who latches onto Dexter and proclaims him her soul-mate.  Already realizing doubts about Harry's honesty, and beginning to question \\"The Code of Harry\\", Dexter reaches into the depths of his bloodlust, and wonders if perhaps he can't find another way.  Season 2 has its share of great surprises, with many scenes that are as funny as they are insightful about our homicidal hero.    \\"Dexter\\" continues to be an awesome show.  Hardly perfect, you can appreciate what works instead of what doesn't.  Some plot threads don't come together, others are rushed together for closure.  But this is a great show for its characters - many who were just sidekick material last Season get the front-stage treatment here (except for Masuka - though, there's still Season 3).  Besides Doakes and Maria Laguerta, we still have Deb (don't make her angry, you wouldn't like her when she's angry; also, don't try to outrun her either), and Rita comes into her own as a force to be reckoned with as well.  The script tosses in Jaime Murray as the hot/scary Lila, and Keith Carradine as FBI Spec. Agent Lundy, the man sent in by the feds to nab \\"The Bay HarborButcher\\".  Billed by some of the Miami detectives as a rock-star of serial-killer hunters, Lundy comes off more like a really helpful and popular HS Teacher...who manages to latch onto Dexter's trail and Deb's heart.  With so many great moments, it's hard to pin down one of them - many of which are funny, twerrifying and heartbreaking at the same time.  In one critical sense, season 2 outstrips the first: Dexter is the only serial killer to fear (even if the rest of Miami begins to cheer more than fear, once they've discovered BHB's predilection for other murderers rather than innocent Floridians).  Now the sole monster, Dexter must confront his own demons and question the identity that has made him a killer.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|I just ordered this movie, so I have yet to see this new DVD version, but it is my FAVORITE Christmas movie from childhood.  I remember being amazed at the reindeer and Santa's toy shop.  It also provides some background for how Santa got to the North Pole.  I LOVE it and recommend it to everyone.
B000W1V5VU|3.0|Will have to watch it again as I seemed to miss much of the action.  Excellent actors with what they had to work with.  Humor much too subtle.  [or I wasn't in the mood for this movie].  Action.  What did I miss?    Danger: again too subtle.  I did get the jist of the story.  Just too slick - Am getting bored with Las Vegas.    See it if you want - but may take more than once to finally figure it out.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I bought 2 of these movie sets.  One of them has no volume We know it is the tape for all other tapes work but 1 that I ordered does not.    thanks Cheryl Lanning 425-413-1835
B000WZAE1I|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. De Niro is a hoot as the pirate ship caption and Pfeiffer is quite magnificent as the witch hell bent on obtaining eternal youth. Claire Danes is just radiant in this movie and the chemistry between her and Charlie Cox (Tristan) works very well here. All in all, 120 minutes of solid fun!
0525950079|4.0|A friend of mine talked me into reading PILLARS OF THE EARTH. Although it was not the greatest book I ever read, I enjoyed it.  When Follet announced the sequel I really had no intention of taking the blunge into another 1000 page novel. However, when I ran across the book in the library and started reading, I got hooked. All in all it was worth the read. As to one reviewer who said it as the greatest book she had ever read, I really question what she has read in the past.<br /><br />For the most part the book was entertaining, although I think that Follet could have cut at least 100 pages and not lost much of the plot.<br /><br />His plot is well done.  His descriptions are graphic.  He creates some truly evil characters and also some very kind and loving one.  As in the first novel, there are a number of undying loves that have their ups and downs.  For those who like \\"get even\\" stories, they will enjoy the twist and turns of the plot.<br /><br />For the most part the characters and the plot are very similar to the earlier work, so if you enjoyed that one you will enjoy the continuation of the story of the monastary.  In terms of history you see the early stages of self government and the way that the serfs finally got their freedom.<br /><br />If you want some entertaining reading and have a lot of time to read, WORLD WITHOUT END is a good recommendation.<br /><br />However, I hope that this is the end of the story.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|If you enjoy Christmas movies that are a bit off the beaten track then this is the movie for you.  It is very hurmous and unusal but can be enjoyed by they whole family.
B000UR9TQO|4.0|Very good sound, nice picture, The Song Remains the Same has been well remastered.  Yes, the cardboard box of the collector's set is rubbish, but the T-shirt and the little cards enclosed are worth the extra price. If you are a fan.
061891868X|5.0|One of the most balanced and factual account of the current state of the art of Physics I have read. I wish I could get a more indepth reasoning of the unsolved problems in Physics.
0151013837|5.0|A truly satisfying and amazing novel.  It is now brilliant in this Illustrated edition.  I think if there is one book a person should read in their lifetime it should be this!
B0001I562I|5.0|Flight of the navigator is my childhood favorite movie, and it contains subtitles (eng/esp) convenient for me.
B000ID37RM|5.0|I re-read the book a few years ago and decided to watch the movie.  The movie is great!  I was very pleased with how clear the video is (I rented it on Unboxed).  For some reason I thought it would look \\"old\\" but it looks sharp.
B00003CWNR|5.0|very good movie shame on you delroy lindo incest is a mess one of my favorite movies I have recommended it to several friends
0525950079|4.0|Maybe I'm just getting accustomed to Follet's style, but I really thought Pillars of the Earth was a much more engaging book. The characters seemed more fleshed out. While interesting, I think the WWE (not wrestling, this novel!) seemed much more mechanical. Similar to The Third Twin, with the 6' tall 120 lb brilliant superheroine pro tennis player Uberbiologist with a 1 carat diamond in her nose, this was much more comic book, with the above mentioned \\"checks\\" than plausible fiction. I'll always give Follet the benefit of the doubt, and be real.... Would you even be a reader of his novels if you didn't like that his villains get routed and the good guys win? That's why I read fiction!! I get plenty of conflicted complicated people in real life for whom things don't always work out. I read him to be entertained, and passably educated. If his details are sloppy, so be it; I'll certainly never quote them as gospel, anymore than I'd expect the physics explanations in Spiderman to hold water. To me, this was a solid 4 star entertainment read.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|excellent movie such cunning and rivalry but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Without going through the litany of underwhelming over-budgeted science fiction films in the last 20 years and without mentioning much about the Firefly TV series, I would sum this movie up as the best charecter-driven science fiction I've seen since The Wrath of Khan. The characters are well drawn, the situations have a believability about them in personal and universal terms and you wind up actually caring about what happens to these people in this universe. You want to see them succeed and continue on. Joss Whedon does a great job. He says more in one sentence with his well chosen cast than most sci fi writers say in a trilogy. I love this film!
B00005B36H|2.0|Tool take a lot a care in their long players. This is in many ways a nice product. However they have spoilt a solid and reliable band by trying to be King Crimson with lots of weird bits of noodling. Now in the days since Sabbath lots of kids have played power chords but the truth is no one quite played power chords as good as Adam Jones. I could enjoy an album of 70 minutes of him just playing 2 or 3 power chords that's how good it is. The musical growth here is just a bit too much for me to handle unfortunately. Ticks and Leeches shows some potential but is sadly still a bit too weird. I just want bands to realise that life is hard and fast and then we die,  I don't want to have to wade my way through so much 'art' to get to the rock I love so much. Now i know that it's Tool's choice to progress and god bless them they have done that without selling out but where am I going to get my power chord release on a thursday night. I don't want to have to turn to Creed or someone else because those pretenders just don't have an ounce of Tool's talent.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|if you like fantasy movie you are sure to love this film. good effects, story, and acting. i loved it.
0793542049|5.0|I recommend this book highly for those interested in walking bass.  I am not very far into the book at all yet and I am already a noticeably improved bass player.  My band noticed the improvement almost immediately. As others have stated there is no tab, that's the caveat..but with a little effort this is not a problem.
0060776757|5.0|This book is one of the best U2 books out there!  Definately a must for any die-hard U2 fan. Perfect for putting out on your coffee table. I bought one for my husband for christmas... he's going to love it!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This was a brand new movie and very interesting...thanks.  I had to watch it for a class, but liked it for personal enjoyment also
B00000IL67|5.0|This box set is so amazing! I own all of his albums on both vinyl and Cd and this box set still gets played more often!  Great mix of songs on each CD.    How is Alice not in the Rock'n'Roll hall of fame (or rather shame)?  The man has put out so much great music!!!    I am a Diehard fan, you can trust me ;)
037582913X|5.0|When our three children were little, this is the book I had to read to them every night.  They have never forgotten it.  For Christmas this year, I bought it for all three of them to bring back wonderful memories.
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Good actors.  Creative idea.  So, why is it terrible?    Well, the ending is the worst bit.  Just when I was gettting into the movie, they try and through a twist in there but it just becaomes a really lame excuse not to finish the story.      The theme ideas of fate and destiny are there, but never really developed to make for good discussion.
B000002WU9|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.  \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" is the greatest rap beat of all time.  I know it's not the most heard or popular but I know what I'm talking about.  For those who don't get it, hopefully you'll get it soon.  For those who do, more power to you.  That beat is sick in countless ways. RZA was and will always be the best producer in history, '93-'97 will never be matched.  Its all been downhill since.  You all just have to trust me.  I truly have the ear.
B000UR9T8W|4.0|I have seen the first two movies in the theatre but have not seen the 3rd one yet.  I will have to wait until Christmas for that as I bought the set of movies for a Christmas present for a family member.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|My family loved watching the Gilmore Girls on tv, but seemed to miss many episodes.  We now own all 7 seasons on DVD and watch and rewatch the them.  Definitely worth the money.
0930289528|4.0|The Graphic Novel lives up to the term \\"Graphic Novel\\". It is a very well written story, with good character development and a very good adventure. The one downside side, although not significant, is the graphics, they leaving you wanting lush full color drawings to further enhance the story. \\"All-in-all\\" it is highly recommended.
B00005JPTI|4.0|The year is 2012, and Dr. Robert Neville (Smith) may be the last man on Earth.  He is partially responsible for a cancer cure that mutated and turned humans into beings that cannot stand sunlight and crave blood.  Neville is lonely, and only has his dog Sam for a friend.  During the day, he searches for food and supplies, and works on trying to cure this awful disease.  At night, he locks himself away in his house and hides from the horrors that wander the streets.  One day, he gets sloppy, and his world becomes worse.<br /><br />Will Smith carries this movie full on his back.  Acting alone or with only a dog, he is the reason to see this movie.  Like Tom Hanks in \\"Castaway\\" or John Cusack in \\"1408\\", he gives a solid performance all on his own.  Visually, \\"I Am Legend\\" is mostly excellent.  A desolate New York City is well rendered and eerie.  The monsters, on the other hand, mostly look like the work of CGI.  That's a shame because CGI wasn't really needed for them.  The story does differ from the classic novel by Richard Matheson, and while the ending isn't a total cop-out, it is a bit disappointing.  On its own merits, \\"I Am Legend\\" works pretty well and is worth checking out.
B000J10KTQ|1.0|I bought this movie mainly for the HD part. But it was the worst HD dvd I ever seen. The picture quality is just like a regular standard dvd or worst. The picture is not clear and vivid like a true HD dvd. I had other movies that are regular dvd and had a better picture quality than this movie when it's upconverted to HD. Not recommended for HD.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This concert was world record renowned, as they had the most powerful laser light show in the world at the time.  The music speaks for itself.  David Gilmore is at the peak of brilliance, and this effort far outweighs their word on The Wall.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am honored to be the 600 th reviewer. I'm buying it for myself as an xmas gift.<br />I grew up watching nature shows, and this brings it all to the forefront. Buy it. If you haven't yet - It will last as long as the sea is blue.
B000UR9T8C|4.0|Schizophrenia is uncommon among the general population, but this movie brings it to the forefront of discussion.
B0007939NO|5.0|Old movies never get old. This movie has one of my fave's actors of all time-Gene Kelly. The dancing, music, and heart-felt script makes you feel the love. This movie opens your eyes to old love stories.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|The Joshua Tree is indeed a U2 classic, a must for all the fans. However, if you think about buying this new remastered version, please make sure you buy the Super Deluxe Edition with DVD. The concert in Paris on this DVD is worth all the money. In fact I was surprised by the sonic quality of recording of the concert and I also liked the atmosphere of the DVD a lot. It is now my third most favourite U2 DVD after exciting Elevation Tours concerts in Boston and Slane Castle. I wonder if there is more concerts like this being shot and not released, because if so, I would definitely like to have them too!     However, DVD is not the only thing. I enjoyed remastered version of CD and thought that also B-sides were quite extensive and enjoyable. And the whole box of the materials, the book, sleeves for CDs and postcards were just well done and make it a definitive gift item. I wish that also Achtung Baby and All That You Can´t Leave Behind would receive similar treatment later on.    In the age of downloading of songs from internet, this is a way to go: making a hard copy of CD a real experience. Than this is even better than a real thing!
0439813786|5.0|This book came to me from my students, who recommended it highly.  A great story uniquely presented in a heavily illustrated format.  The illustrations are divine.
B000RF7XYO|5.0|I found the way the picture has been edited gave great depth to an historic character, who was both strong and forthright. Kate Blanchet's portrayal of Elizabeth Tudor was masterful as was Geffory Rush's performance. I casn't wait to buy Elizabeth the Golden age
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|I purchased this for my brother who has heard it and loved it and put it at the top of his Christmas list.  I do love almsot all of Peter Gabriel's songs.
B00030590I|5.0|After waiting forever for this movie to tivo...I give up.  I must buy my own copy.  I have never watched most movies more than once.  I think the matrix was the last one.  I'LL WATCH THIS OVER AND OVER.  People are angry over this film.  Let us remember it is a MOVIE not a documentary.  The imagination of this film is fantastic.  I have NEVER liked any kung fu movies.  NEVER subtitles.  This is moving, flowing art.  I can't wait to see it again.  I can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to see it (7).  She's in TKD but she will enjoy this no matter what kind of \\"battle\\"  is going on.  It is an intense film and the colors are amazing.  I only wish there were more like it to see.  The way the color is used in this movie creates emotion that matches what is going on and gives depth to the storyline. Almost like 3D, but in a different way. I hope this makes sense to anyone reading it.  I don't write reviews on movies but this is too good to pass up!  EVEN IF IT IS NOT \\"YOU'RE THING\\"!  RELAX AND LET YOUR MIND GO.  THINGS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SENSE!
B000002H97|5.0|Simply put, I never would have gotten into Metallica were it not for this album.  Many believe Metallica betrayed their fan base by changing things up for this album, but without having done so they never would have gotten the radio and video exposure they did.    I never even heard of Metallica until I heard Unforgiven.  Yes, that is mostly because I live in a hick town, but still without Metallica going \\"mainstream\\" with these songs I likely still would not know the pleasure of listening to all of their albums.      Besides, bands can't be expected to keep doing the exact same thing over and over.  If they did, people would be complaining about that.      This album allows those not necessarily into heavy metal a chance to discover Metallica.  Plus, there is still plenty for any metal enthusiast to enjoy.  No, it's not as fast and hard as previous Metallica offerings, but it has a lot more style, quality, and variety than anything they did previously.    If you haven't ever really listened to this CD, do so.  I honestly don't see how anyone could deny its excellence.
0805079831|5.0|There have been only a handful of books that have significantly changed the way I see the world, and this is one of them. Klein writes beautifully, persuasively, and without hysterics as she describes some of the most horrifying and appalling behavior that the human race is capable of.    To me the essence of her story is this: The only force that can control the ruthless predations of global corporations is government. As long as we continue to put representatives of those corporations in power, we are doomed.    Klein's book is as electrifying as any thriller. Whenever she touched on any subjects that I knew a little about (such as the history and government of Argentina) I could not fault her expertise.  She is scrupulous in acknowledging her sources and everything rings true.    Among her accomplishments: making perfect sense of the perfect disaster in Iraq; documenting the links between big business and Latin American dictatorships that most histories ignore; connecting the dots between the tsunami in Sri Lanka, the drowning of New Orleans, and the economic ruin of Russia.  She offers us a terrifying vision of a Red Zone future for all but the wealthy elite, and tells us what we have to do to keep it from happening.    I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|A few of the DVDs don't play well, but it is still a great buy!
B000VNMMRA|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I have seen numbers 1, 2 & 3 many, many times and I am very happy that this movie lived up to the hype that it was more like the first movie.  Although I did not feel like the villains, especially the man, looked or acted evil enough, as my husband said, you cannot tell how evil someone is by just looking -- it is within them - that is how they get away with it.  I thought the woman \\"bad guy\\" was more evil looking than Timothy Olyphant's character.<br /><br />VERY GOOD ACTION, lots of fun -- be on the lookout for the vehicle coming out of the tunnel.  What an amazing feat.<br /><br />I have this 2 disk set but it was late when we watched the movie and I have not had a chance to check the extras.  Sometimes it is better to watch a movie two or three times before you watch the \\"how to\\" features or it really spoils the movie for you.  This happened with Cast Away with Tom Hanks.  I watched everything in one sitting and all I can remember is the blue screens used for the many scenes.  I haven't even seen the whole movie in full since then.  I would like to forget the \\"how to\\" features.  3/6/09 I finally did watch Cast Away recently and had almost forgotten how they made the movie and enjoyed it much more.<br /><br />I recommend Live Free or Die Hard - I do not know what the theatrical version looks like, I believe it is included in this set, however.  I am sure that it maybe doesn't have as much language and maybe graphic violence?  Not really sure since the movie seemed \\"normal\\" for this genre.  ;-)<br /><br />3/6/09 I do NOT like that in every Die Hard movie the wife (and in this one - the daughter) hates the main character John McClane, and then he saves their lives and it is OK again until the next movie.  Now why would the daughter hate her father?  Because he doesn't live with them?  Not his fault - the mother divorced him not the other way around.
1592332803|5.0|I'm new to vegan baking, and am baking up a storm after buying this book.     Try the raspberry oatmeal bars, chocolate chip cookies and sugar cookies with Royal Icing(the almond extract in this recipe gives it a nice flavor). Outstanding. These taste better than their non-vegan counterparts, and I'm a tough critic when it comes to cookies.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I remember watching this as a child and wanted to buy it.  My 2yo neice happened to watch it and is obsessed with it now.  She absolutely loves it also and it definitely is a timeless piece.
B00008GKEG|4.0|Product came shipped fast. This is a Christmas gift so I can not rate the actual item. But it came fast and was shipped properly and arrived at my house in excellent condition.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired.  It has stood the test of time.  I believe that anyone, any age, would love this show!  It is simple, yet so complex.  It is a rare gem and I get to enjoy it over and over!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Recently when I purchased Pumping Iron I had only viewed the original up until now. After watching the special edition I was very pleased. This film has everything you can expect from a great Docu-Drama and will not let you down. From cut scenes to awesome interviews with Arnold you're definitely getting your money worth. So hurry get yours now.
0375714839|5.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is a unique trip into the past by Marjane Satrapi, who uses the graphic novel approach to give us a rich narrative full of happiness, heartbreak, suspense and wicked comedy. These are her illustrated memories of her childhood in Iran during the brutal reign of the Shah and then her and her family's experiences during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and afterwards as fundementalists come to power and Satrapi's world changes forever. Like the best memoirs Satrapi's are strikingly honest and objective. This is neither a protest against Iran's system or an endorsement, it is the record of a woman's life during important historical events and how these events individually affect people, lives and personal histories. With beautiful, comic illustrations Satrapi brings her family's fascinating story to life, we see her grow-up with educated, Leftist parents who raise her knowing about the PLO, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and Iran's own martyrs. They despise the U.S.-backed, or better put, the U.S.-INSTALLED regime of the Shah and passionately take to the streets to protest the Monarch. Marjane watches all this with wonderous curiosity as she imagines Marx and God debating. When the Shah falls there is cheering in the streets, but soon the country finds itself divided as the Islamic Republic is born and friends, families and loved ones are torn apart by the new way of life and a brutal war with Iraq. Satrapi chronicles all this and more, including her early years as an exile in Europe with a sharp eye for details big and small, with great humor and a style that makes this a universal story. Many of us will find ourselves relating to so much of what Marjane goes through, the way she explores her inner thoughts, worries and moments of joy is impressive because of the heart and psychological depth she displays. This edition of \\"Persepolis,\\" where parts 1 and 2 are combined due to the upcoming release of the motion picture edition should be the definitive edition for readers to purchase. Once you start reading you get hooked, and there's no sense in having to look for part two when you can have the complete story here. \\"Persepolis\\" is one of the best recent memoirs about those who experienced the Islamic Revolution, and one of the best memoirs in general. Satrapi's book is also a cultural gem, because in our tense times it is important to read the stories that display the humanity of \\"the other side.\\" Satrapi does not condone much of what the Islamic regime did in the years immediately following the revolution, but she also makes a point of why the revolution happened. She doesn't shy away from showing how friends of her family were tortured by the Shah's secret police, the Savak or from the fact that the Savak were trained by the CIA. In her introduction Satrapi clearly mentions that in 1953 the CIA overthrew Iran's Prime Minister, Mohammed Mossadeq, because he planned to nationalize the country's oil, and installed the Shah as supreme leader. Satrapi shows an impressive, objective look at history, something we need now more than ever when talking about the Middle East. \\"Persepolis\\" is a masterpiece, a grand effort that deserves to be read more than once.
B000WZAE1I|2.0|While writer Gaiman aspired to write an adult fairy tale, \\"Stardust\\" falls short on both accounts.  Another reviewer correctly identified it as a new \\"Princess Bride,\\"  an adult spoof of children's fairy tales.  And, as a spoof, it might have worked, except for the graphic violence, exploding heads and several impalings.  Bing Crosby once asked, \\"Would you like to swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar . . . or would you rather be a jerk?\\"  \\"Stardust\\" chooses to be jerky.  When will filmmakers realize that the successes of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are not about the gee-whiz special effects and sweeping vistas but about the integrity of the writing.  \\"Stardust\\" insults the genre of fantasy rather than complementing it.  Want to read an adult fairy tale?  Try Stephen Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series.  Want to see an adult fairy tale? Try John Boorman's \\"Excalibur.\\"
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using this model (and the earlier versions in the line) of headphone for many, many years now.  They have accompanied me from cassette walkman to CD player to iPod.  As inexpensive as these are, they are surprisingly well made with great durability.  I use them to run and work out and have never been disappointed.  When the time comes after many months of my abusing them with hard exercise, I always look to get the exact same model to replace them.      I could not recommend this product any more highly.
B000ATQYT2|2.0|I bought two copies of this; one for myself, one for my Grand Daughter. When it arrived the cellophane said it was made in Mexico and it looked it. The outer case looked like a pirated copy you'd get off a street vendor in Kabal. The disc itself was wafer thin and I can tell won't age well. The audio on my old VHS is better quality. Disney cheaped out on what is an American Christmas classic and for what? I paid retail so I would have it a long time. My old VHS will probably outlast it.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|I am a Bruce fan from way back.<br /> I was alive and well when \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" came out.<br /><br />Loved it.<br /><br />\\"The Wild, The Innocent . . .\\", \\"Born to Run\\"<br /> Again, yes, wonderful albums.<br /><br />Recently, The Rising -- >>><br />OMFG is it a great album - no less than exquisite!!!<br /><br />But, this offering, Magic, the first thing I am compelled to say is, \\"Bruce, dude, what were you thinking?\\"<br /><br />It's almost like Bruce was trying to sound like Three doors Down, or Soul Asylum, or some hipster act - and believe me, I don't want to say this, it's just that it sounds forced, contrived, like he was trying too hard to go for the crossover sound . . .<br /><br />I have a hard time even listening to the album. It is too jam-packed with sound, with riffs, with things in between the lines. The production values obscure and muddy the songs, which is a HUGE problem. I can't love it, even though I wanted to.<br /><br />The recording is much too wall-of-sound-esque.<br /><br />I have no idea why he would do this to his music.<br />I hesitate to even say that the music is good, BUT. . .<br />You cannot separate the music from the way it is made.<br />Overall, the production and the layer upon layer doesn't work for me one bit.<br /><br /> I can't help but wonder what it would have sounded like if Bruce had made this on a smaller budget, or in a less-than-huge studio setting, or with fewer players, where he had to work with what he had, rather than work in everything he could.<br /><br />Ah, well.<br /> Bruce is still The Boss.<br />I hope next time is much different than this one.<br /><br />I still luv ya dude. Strong.
B000URDEB0|4.0|With the replacement of lead vocalist Tarja by the more pop-oriented Annette, the band's sound has changed somewhat. It is impossible to not have that happen when you lose a superb vocalist like Tarja. That said, the sound  still is tight and full, alive and breathing. The tribute to Tarja, \\"Bye bye Beautiful\\" is excellent. While I fell in love with Nightwish with Tarja, the new line-up has tremendous potential. Annette is a top-end Chevy, Tarja a Lamborghini's. Different, but both fine.
B000VI70WM|5.0|One of the definite high points of Duran Duran's long and varied career. The sparse, snappy funk-pop arrangements and Simon Le Bon's unmistakeable vocals grab hold from the first track and simply don't let go till the end--there is not one track I would consider skipping over.  In spite of what many fans from back in the day might expect from them, KUDOS to Duran Duran for wanting to be more than a  nostalgia act, and sounding every bit as youthful and energetic as they did when they were barely out of their teens.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|This is a very good film indeed. Why the critics did not realize that this is really the way Las Vegas is. The film is so accurate and documented. One of Verhoheven's best, with 'Starship Troopers'.   People have a hard time accepting the truth I guess.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a clean, fun filled, romantic comedy - the kind you would like to go on and on.  Although there are a few swear words and some physical contact, it is not overdone like so many other movies today.  All the actors do a wonderful job.
B00008GKEG|5.0|As a kid in the 60's who loved the Beatles, the idea that you could watch them on TV for hours on end was a dream that had no way of fulfillment.<br />I suppose that adds to the aura of the Anthology as much as the actual content. Looking at the footage of concerts and photo shoots, listening and seeing the \\"lads\\" tell their stories is a treat as well as a time capsule experience for those of us who have memories of our own that go back to those years.<br />For the younger generations, this series affords the opportunity to see what that era looked like and get a better feel for what was...for better or for worse...a decade of unprecedented change in the world and the individual lives of those who were there.<br />The Beatles personified those changes, and were at times leading the way.  Whether it was a goal of theirs or simply serendipity is the charm of the story and needs to be seen to be believed.<br />Of course I recommend it.  Of course.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|If you like this series of action movies starring Bruce Willis, then you do yourself a great disservice by passing up this movie.  Great action, sometimes way too over the top though, great dialog, and the Mac commercial guy plays a convincing cyber geek because, well, that's the only role he's played.  Definitely a must own.
0743289684|4.0|I will be the first to admit that I would have never picked up this book if it wasn't for a patron at the library urging me to do so. He told me that it was one of the best books he had ever read and I thought, why not? I probably should not have read it during the holiday season simply because this is not a book that you can pick up and read whenever you can find five minutes or maybe fifteen. It is too slow for that ~~ it is a book that requires you to sit and read it in all its intensity. And it is intense. It is passionate. It is compelling.     I vaguely remember hearing about the Dutch film producer who was assasinated while riding a bike, but I think that happened during my baby haze days. She barely touched on that whole story but she revealed so much about her life that it's fascinating. It is definitely a different life than the one I have in the Western World so it is very hard to fathom what it is like to be a Muslim woman growing up in war-strife Africa, moving from one country to another and essentially being abandoned by her father over and over through the years. It is interesting to see a transformation from a meek girl who is always obedient to her father to a strong-willed survivor who took advantage of the country she is in. It is interesting to read over and over again how women in Muslim countries are constantly abused and trod upon ~~ it is almost as if all the rumors floating around came to life in one book, one life.    This isn't a book to love (that Amazon rating really should be realistic ~~ 5 should be for good and compelling writing, not that I love it!) because it is a hard book to digest as it is about one woman's fight for all Muslim women and for herself. It is about a life fought for over years of oppression and repression. It is bitter in spots and triumphant in others. This woman has endured so much in her short life that in spite of it all, she has climbed out of the depths of hell and tried to lend a helping hand to other women~~ only to be condemned for it.     I gave it a four star simply because it is extremely long-winded in spots. It has a lot of the \\"me me\\" factor in it, which is annoying as heck for me (which is why I don't read a lot of autobiographies). Plus, the whole political scene didn't make sense to me ~~ isn't there another way she could have attracted publicity to her cause other than being a member of the Dutch Parliament? And the whole \\"Right Wing Vs. Liberal\\" issue really got me confused. I thought the Right Wing was for the fundamentalists who wants to keep religion and state together whereas the Liberals are the ones who want to abolish that. I think it must be different in Holland than it is here ~~ because I definitely don't view Aayan as a right winger. She sounds like she's advocating changes against one of the oldest religious traditions in the world and while speaking the truth about the Quran, she is also fighting for change among the way women are treated. She's not afraid to speak the truth as she sees it.     This book is courageous but so hard to digest simply because it is hard to imagine the horrors this woman has seen, especially in this little corner of the Midwest. She is courageous to fight the battle against domestic violence and against religious oppression. This is one woman to keep an eye on throughout the years.     12-21-07
B000WGZGNS|5.0|Beyonce puts on a show that is professionally entertaining!!!  Absolute talent is seen on this fantastic DVD.  Wonderful - money well spent!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Alright, this has got to be one of the best albums I have ever listen too. Avenged Sevefold completely turns the other way from their first album (hey I made a joke! course, you won't get it if you don't know of their first album) and finishes the work \\"Waking the Fallen\\" started. While \\"Waking the Fallen was good and contained some good songs that didn't contain much screaming in it, \\"City Of Evil\\" completely blows it out of the water and the only screaming you will hear will be fore intros like \\"Beast And The Harlet\\" or near the end of \\"Blinded in Chains\\", both which are awesome songs.   I first got the idea to pick up this album after playing \\"Beast and the Harlet\\" on guitar hero 2, and I was awestruck. After picking up \\"City Of Evil,\\" my introduction to Avenged Sevenfold, it took me a while to get used to this new sound. At the time, I was intrested in punk bands like Fall Out boy, but it was this album that got me leaning over to the \\"heavier\\" side of music, eventually to Iron Maiden somehow...I don't something about this album has an 80's feel to me. While this album may take some time for you like, as with the case with me, and it may not please fans of \\"Sounding of the seventh trumpet\\", believe me, once you catch on, you will LOVE IT. So here's my review:    Track 1.) \\"Beast And The Harlet\\" (rating- 10 out of 10-AWESOME)  Hey, this sets the mood nicely. If you haven't yet experienced this song in gh2, prepare to band your head. It is perhaps the best song on this album, which is saying something, because, to be frank, nearly all the songs on this album are in the running to be best on this album! That's how good this album is! Anyway, \\"Beast And The Harlet\\" is surely entertaining and one of Avenged Sevenfolds best songs! Great listen!    Track 2.) \\"Burn It Down\\" ( Rating- 8.5 out of 10- awesome song)  Ok, while you may love \\"Beast and the harlet\\" and have it tatoo'ed on your back already even though it's only been about 5 minutes after you purchased the cd,be prepared for something a little different, but not much. Now, \\"Burn It Down\\" is one of those songs on here that takes some time to like. But believe me, once you give it a chance, you will love it. It's another great song! While it may not want you to pick up a torch and burn miniture models of houses to ashes as with \\"Beast and the Harlet,\\" it's still going to give you that rush as the first track did, just in a little smaller dose. Great Listen too!    Track 3.) \\"Blinded in Chains\\" (rating- 9.5- Awesome song!)    Here we have another song that grows on you over time. As soon as you listen to it a few times, you realize how good this song it is! One of the best songs on this album! However, sometimes I feel as if the cuss words mentioned here ruin the song a bit, but then I realized \\"who cares, it's a great song!\\" Won't dissapoint and yet another note worthy song!    Track 4.) \\"Bat Country\\" (Rating- 10 out of 10- AWESOME!)    If you haven't seen the music video to this when it was literally fired from a machine gun from MTV and VH1 onto your tv screens when this album came out, be prepared for another song that takes some time to appreciate if you are unfamilar to this sort of sound( sort of like a mixture of punk lyrics and heavy guitar riffs and whatnot!). But soon, you realize this is the best song or one of the best songs on this album! It's packed with energy like \\"Beast and the harlet\\", has an amazing solo like \\"The Beast and the harlet,\\" paints a picture like, once again, \\"the beast and the harlet\\", yet has a sound that belongs to its self and its self alone...like \\"the beast and th-\\"...you know...AWESOME SONG!!!    Track 5.) \\"Trash and Scatterered\\" ( Rating- 9 out of 10- Awesome song!)    Here we have, yet another great song! This song leans more to the \\"Burn it down\\" side than \\"Blinded in chains,\\" but soon you may find yourself listening to this song regularly as soon as you open up to it. Once again, another great song on this epic album!    Track 6.)\\"Seize the Day\\" (Rating- 8.5 out of 10- great slow paced song)    Whoa! What the hell happened! Everything just slowed down and that guys voice became milky smooth all of a sudden! Ahh well, it's a good song...    Now, \\"Seize the Day\\" may not be Avenged Sevenfolds' best \\"sweet 'n slow\\" song, but it's still good. In fact, it's one of the few slow paced songs I actually like, and that's saying something! In fact, gernally, I hate all these slow songs and all this new stuff today like rascal flats and this r&b crap. Worthy listen to, and calms you down from the other 5 action packed song.    Track 7.) \\"Sidewinder\\" (Rating- 9.5 out of 10- awesome song!)    Here we have an intresting song that changes direction everynow and then. One moment, you think it's gona go right, but then goes in the opposite direction while saying \\"left is cooler, right can burn in hell for all I care!\\"...quite unpredictable, one moment following a climbing riff, this goes into this sidewinding sort of tune and the mood from the part before changes. The moderate tempo in the beginning, became fast paced, slowed down, and moderate. Still, just because it takes you on this roller coaster that not just goes up and down but left, right, diagonal right, hell even backwards, doesn't mean it's a great song. Yet another noteworthy song on here that's is a great listen too!    Track 8.) \\"The Wicked End\\" (rating- 8.5 of 10- great song)    Here we have another song that's intresting and great listen too. Quite different then what you normally hear I bet, but once again, I really can't dis this song. What can I say, it's a great song! Like \\"Sidewinder,\\" you'll find some parts changing rapidly, but don't get me wrong, it's a great song.    Track 9.) \\"Strength Of The World\\" (rating- 10 out of 10- AWESOME!)    Alright, get some snacks and prepare for a dozy. Here we have an epic at about 9:15 and tells a story. It's quite different from the other songs on this album, but it's one of the best songs on here. Infact, it's my personal favorite! It's just so...epic! Listen to it, go on...don't be afraid, it's a song of awesomeness!  However, I don't mean to relate this to anything like rhasody or follow those lines, Avenged Sevenfold contains it's own special flare, leaves some parts missing, and allows the listener to fill in the gaps themselves, which frankly, works out well = ).    Track 10.) \\"Betrayed\\" (rating- 8.5 out of 10-good song!)    Here we have yet another...again...good song! While you may not be listening to this one and prefering to play the hell out of Bat Country or something, this song is still a great listen and worth your time.    Track 11.) \\"M.I.A.\\" (rating- 10 out of 10- AWESOME!)    Ahh, here we go, a perfect way to close. This song starts up all quite with a simple yet pretty guitar part...you just know all hell is about to break lose, don't ya? While hell might not come roaring out of the gates, a perfect blend of harmony and melody does! This is, again, another one of Avenged Sevenfolds best songs. I consider it underated as it's quite overshadowed by \\"Beast and the Harlet\\" and \\"Almost Easy\\" from the newer album these days, but without out a doubt, it is one of Avenged Sevenfolds best. Turn it on, play it, learn it, love it!    Overall Review- See all those negative posts giving this album a 1 star rating? Ignore those, they are just fans of the first and second album who are taking this change in the right direction a little too hard. While \\"Waking the Fallen\\" contained some great songs yes, I can safely say \\"City Of Evil\\" kills it as nearly every song on here is...well, great! This is possibly Avenged Sevenfolds best album to date and well worth more than your 15 bucks so get it before it becomes some lost rare like Metallica's \\"Master Of Puppets\\" album at my wal-mart (keyword- *my*, because my wal-mart sucks and hardly restocks on cd's at all =( ) .    All and all, this album is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Rating- 10.5 out of 10
B000OY8NII|5.0|I love this series! I wish season 2 was on DVD as well. Soo glad they renewed for a 3rd Season.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|When you have titles like \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Fight Club\\" under your belt, you kind of go into the movie expecting a phenomenal (yet mildly flawed) movie. The movie didn't focus on the killings like I had expected. So if your expecting a slasher or thriller, look elsewhere. Instead, it opts to focus on how it consumes the individuals. Detectives Toschi and Armstrong are subjected to copious amounts of bad help from citizens which adds on to a really long and tedious case. I think the movie does too good of a job showcasing how tedious it really was because instead of feeling bad for the detectives, I just felt bad for myself because of how long it was taking. *Spoiler* The part where Armstrong is about to get out of the car and says he can't take being on call anymore, it was literally 30 mins. too late for me to really care. Armstrong is probably the least fleshed out of the characters. The movie implies how the case is straining Toschi's marriage, but it doesn't go into too much depth at all. You can just tell there is a growing distance between the two, yet you barely hear anything out of her mouth and there never really was one of those it scenes to really display the stress (the most was when he hangs up the phone from her hand). After watching this movie I know I couldn't be a cop because they covered almost every friggin aspect of it. They observe every crime scene extensively, everything you'd see on the report. Think of like the opening part of Law & Order where the detectives examine the scene for a few seconds, find the witness that makes the case in about 10 minutes, and arrest the bad guy at around the half hour mark. Well it's sort of like that cept they examine each scene for what seems like 20 mins. and then go back to headquarters and discuss it with the captain and each other for another 10, and then go to the next murder, rinse and repeat. I have no doubt this would be an excellent read, but for a movie, it's just too much detail to pay attention to allof it especially when you never feel like they are ever really that close to catching the guy *spoiler* (until they get the connection with the watch and the symbol)  So bravo for being realistic, but nay for not being exciting.     I think Jake Gyllenhaal's character is ultimately the most interesting. His fascination turns to uncontrolled obsession. His relationship with his girlfriend/wife, Avery, Toschi, and the case are really what makes this movie interesting. You could almost separate the movie into two acts, with the first going to Armstrong and Toschi and the second to Gyllenhaal and everything in his life. As the case slowly consumes him, you see how his marriage breaks down, his relationship with Toschi builds into a love/hate manner in that he wants to be done with the case but all the leads Gyllenhaal fines he can't help but pursue, like the case that got away. Eventually, he gets to close, and the killer begins harassing him via phone. Ultimately, the movie comes to an interesting conclusion with the whole \\"you may have gotten away with it, but someone knows\\" and I found it to be rather enjoyable.    I'd almost recommend skipping to the part where Gyllenhaal becomes thee predominant character in the movie, but then you wouldn't know what the killer is all about. I think the movie loses points with the almost grotesque amount of time devoted to detective work, at the same time not focusing enough on Armstrong and Toschi's relationship with each other and individual relationships with their families. If the director's cut (coming in January) adds some of that, my score would go up, even if it meant the movie had to go longer. However, if it adds more detective work, the movie would lose more points. That's not to say \\"the second act\\" doesn't involve any investigating, the movie still does plenty of that, but it just devotes a good chunk of time to developing Gyllenhaal's character. If you don't care about any of the characters, what's the point of watching any movie? And I think that's what ultimately saves it. It's interesting, done well, the acting is great, but too much detective work for me. If you enjoy that sort of stuff, you will get a lot more enjoyment out of the first half.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Someday, when our children's children want to know what the \\"real\\" blues was like, they will have this DVD to find out. The CD is good, the DVD is great ! I hope the next KWS album turns out half as good !
0385504209|5.0|I'm sure you've heard all the controversy surrounding this book.  Well, remember, it's JUST A BOOK - it's fiction and should be read as such.  And it's GOOD fiction, it keeps you interested and moves at a great pace.
B000ZN8036|5.0|I'm always a little amazed when I come across other people's negative reviews on a movie that I think very highly of.   But it's just a reminder that art & meaning are in the eye of the beholder.  If you have ever felt like you didn't belong or if you have ever been fed up with the status quo and wanted to get away from it all, you'll get this movie.  If you've never felt that way or knew of anyone like Chris McCandless, you'll be clueless and completely baffled by his actions.  He was young, naive and idealistic- it was a tragic loss.
0930289528|4.0|This is the original graphic novel that the movie was made from - and the movie took some interesting liberties.  I love the movie so I had to get the book.    While scenes in the book are quite different from the movie - especially he Houses of Parliament and the Old Bailey - it's an absorbing read with very good graphics and an excellent story line.    As soon as I finished it, my son grabbed it and I may not see it again unless I threaten him with a baseball bat!!
B000YAA6AU|4.0|\\"PS I Love You\\" is a delightful film about a young widow and how her husband, knowing he was dying, left her a legacy of letters designed to encourage her into living again after his death.  Hilary Swank delivers a high-energy performance opposite the always sexy Gerard Butler.  Lisa Kudrow is a hoot as Hilary's friend.  Gina Gershon, James Marsters (Spike from \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame), Harry Connick, Jr., and Kathy Bates round out the cast.  The locations are rich and beautiful!  Even the apartment where Hilary lives and the pub her mother owns are almost characters, themselves.  This film made me laugh - the priest singing at the Irish wake was particularly amusing.  It made me cry - too many times to name.  It made me laugh while I was crying.  It is a lovely movie filled with lots of surprises!
B000000OAN|5.0|While this CD contains such classics as 'You're My Best Friend', 'Love of My Life' and 'Bohemian Rhapsody', it has so much more.    One of the tracks that's totally different is 'Seaside Rendevous' - not what I expected but a great song with Queen's patented harmonies.    This is a must for anyone completing a CD collection, and I guarantee it won't just sit and gather dust.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|I suppose if I were a teenager again, this movie would be scary and I could entertain the idea of, \\"What if the premise of the movie was real?\\", but I am too mature for that kind of nonsense and there is nothing believable about this movie, especially the acting by Keanu Reeves. Every single movie that Keanu has been in, he has displayed the same exact mannerisms, stoic expressions, and delivery. The only Keanu cliche acting that was not used in this movie was the very well worn out, \\"Whoa!\\". Even the camera movements looked and felt like they were copied from The Matrix. Keanu is a very lucky person because he has always been in demand for the kind of these kind of movies that he has been typecast into and he has become a teenage cult figure. But in my mind, he just would never be believable in any other acting role, for example, Rachel Weisz is the exact opposite of Keanu in acting ability. She has an emotional depth and expression that makes her look and feel so alive, while Keanu has the emotional depth of a spoon. Keanu's apparently bad acting is distracting and ruins the movie.<br /><br />Since the special effects are good and the storyline is okay, I decided to give this movie at least one star. I like \\"demons exist\\" and afterlife movies because of the psychology of belief, not because they are credible, and this movie does not disappoint me in that regard. I would recommend this movie for teenagers, but not for adults -- unless you are like me and like collecting these kind of things, even if they are not very good.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|First the history: Hong Kong was given back to China by the British in 1996 but was decided that nothing would change for 50 years -- until the year 2046.    Now the movie.  To me, \\"2046\\" is a metaphor for how the Chinese in Hong Kong would be feeling in the year 2046 when they will be fully under Chinese rule.  Some who can't or won't accept change will ask why can't things go back to the way it was before, while others will embrace what the future holds.  Something like that.  Remember the owner telling Chow to stay in 2047 for a while and move to 2046 when the room was ready?  Chow later says that he got used to 2047 and decided to stay.    The characters are culled from 2 previous WKW movies that loosely form this trilogy.  Carina Lau is Lulu from \\"Days of Being Wild\\".  Tony Leung also from that movie but only in the very last minute of the film, and of course, he was in \\"In the Mood for Love\\".  He not only gets to act with his beautiful real-life girlfriend, Carina, but his other female co-stars are also legendary beauties in Asian cinema.  Maggie Cheung/Su Lichen is only in a dream sequence, Faye Wong/owner's daughter (this is only her second WKW film) whom Chow has grown affection for, but willing to let her (HK) go, Zhang Ziyi/Bai Ling (a new addition to WKW's stable of muses) who loves Chow (HK) unconditionally whatever his flaws, and Gong Li/Black Spider who wants to go with him but is stuck in the past.    The film is presented in 3 viewpoints: the present \\"real life\\" in which Chow is the womanizer who can't be pinned down because of how much he still loves Su Lichen in ITMFL and she is the yardstick by which all future relationships are measured.  The futuristic scenes are when he is writing his sci-fi novel and his \\"real life\\" people and experiences work their way into the novel.  Also, when he can't deal with real life, he goes to his novel and integrates recent real life events into the novel to help make sense of it all.  Then there is the one or twodream sequences for when he is narrating his thoughts to us, the viewer.    I'm sure this is only the surface of the many layers this wonderful movie has to explore.  I look forward to \\"getting\\" more of it with each new viewing.    p.s. after reading others' reviews, I must add that the room in this movie is not the same as in ITMFL, but it does have the same room number which, when it gets his attention, Chow is transported back to the remembrance of the love of his life.

0792844890|5.0|This was the kind of comedy I viewed as a kid, when campy, hammy jokes still had their own charm unlike the goof gags of the \\"Superbads\\", \\"Jackasses\\" and \\"Road Trips\\".  You had to have more background knowledge than high school and college humor to understand the wealth of jokes.  Rarely are there comedies anymore that have you laughing at every turn or quoting lines for years to come.  Some say Spaceballs started Mel Brooks's downhill turn, but it's still as popular today as it was when it first became a hit.  The best comedies are the ones that are done in all seriousness.    Cheers to a classic.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Excuse the pretentious title but with 277 other reviews on the page I thought I needed to oversell.    Most other reviews have praised the movie to the skies - deservedly - but I wanted to focus on a particular aspect of the film's structure.    We are introduced to a talking rodent - a classic opening move dating back to Mickey Mouse. He is clearly the protagonist - the person to whom the story is happening - of a standard fairytale dilemma. His status, as protagonist of a Disney movie, is further underlined by his having an American accent, which has been de rigeur for many years (in olden times the hero could be upper-class English e.g. Pongo from 101 Dalmations or Wendy, the real protagonist of Peter Pan). Except we see, early on, that from the perspective of an old lady his speech is just rat-squeaking. So the convention of talking animals is followed, but the convention of their being understood by humans (apart from the dead chef Gusteau) is not, and this is fundamental to what follows.    When Remy comes to Paris, his fate becomes enmeshed with that of Linguini who, despite being ostensibly French and named after a type of pasta, has an American voice, and a somewhat more American world-view than Remy. He is dispatched with Remy to put him to death (echoes of Snow White). But at this point, something really interesting happens: the movie suddenly switches sides and Linguini is promoted to the status of protagonist. Almost from one scene to the next, we suddenly have not just a new protagonist, but a very different one: human, sexed, and in some ways less loveable than the cute rat we started with (although that may be a matter of taste).    What's even more interesting is what happens to Remy. He has to communicate through dumb show. It's human nature to perceive someone as less intelligent if they are not communicating in their own language, and Remy undergoes the common immigrant experience of being downgraded in this way. While he is still charming, we are no longer in sympathy with him, in the sense of seeing events unfold from his perspective.    In some ways this is similar to a device used by Melville. Moby Dick begins with the egocentric \\"Call me Ishmael\\". But over the course of the book, Ishmael's voice gradually falls silent in the presence of the more forceful Ahab, and Melville becomes almost an anonymous narrator, before the re-emergence of Ishmael in the final chapter.    In the next phase of Ratatouille, Remy does, indeed, disappear from view, under Linguini's hat. This is a fascinating sequence - not only is he no longer the protagonist, he's been removed from the screen! His character is still brilliantly present in the automated movements of Linguini's arms (admittedly this device is a hard sell, but once you've bought it, it's made to work incredibly well). But in this third version of Remy, he's been reduced to pure objective: he is a personification of the will to make good food, of which Linguini is the puppet.    Apart from representing and allieviating America's unrequited love (and sometimes requited hate) for the French, Linguini also represents another very common type of character in movies, perhaps especially American ones. He is the character to whom all good things happen through no merit of his own. This character type is so popular because it gives underachievers (and we're all underachievers compared to our heroes) someone to relate to, along with the pleasant fantasy that \\"it could happen to you\\". In this respect Linguini performs a function that Remy can not, because Remy is driven by a passion and dedication that few in the audience will share. Ironically, then, Linguini serves to make Remy's quest acceptable not just to the restaurant staff and diners, but also to the audience.    From there, Remy reappears and the movie settles into a more conventional buddy movie, which works fine for the (not wholly convincing) resolution of the plot. But it is the early stages that really takeus to a level of narrative complexity which is, to say the least, highly unusual in a movie of any kind, never mind in an animated Hollywood blockbuster for kids.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Buddy is a human, accidentally taken from an orphanage as a baby, ending up with Santa's elves, and getting raised by them. He grows up much taller than they are. Buddy finds out that his father works in the Empire State Building, and sets out to find him.<br /><br />Buddy has no clue as to what city life is like, and there is one funny scene after another. Buddy hops on the lines painted on the street. He goes into revolving doors, and \\"rides\\" them for a long time. He makes goofy motions as he attempts to straddle the steps of an escalator. He jumps from mattress to mattress in a department store. He eats pigeon droppings from off the fences (ugh!). He takes a flyer from one man and then passes it on to another man who is passing out flyers--back and forth.<br /><br />Knowing the real Santa, Buddy exposes the Santa at Gimbel's store as a fraud. There is quite a row there, right in front of the children! But then Buddy stays at the store overnight and decorates it in a fashion never seen before.<br /><br />Over time, Buddy's father warms up to him. It isn't easy. Buddy acts like a huge overgrown child, and is a constant source of irritation in the family and at his father's workplace. Buddy's eating habits are bizarre, to say the least. Everything must have candy!<br /><br />In time, Buddy becomes close to his half-brother, a boy named Michael. After school, Buddy meets him, and they walk home together. Suddenly, some boys pelt both of them with snowballs. No problem. Buddy picks up a bunch of snowballs and hurls them at the adversaries in machine-gun fashion, hitting all of them squarely. They all scatter.<br /><br />Santa's Sleigh crashes in Central Park in New York. Only Buddy can repair it, and then only the spirit of Christmas can make it fly again. (The spirit of Christmas involves such things as singing Christmas songs, and believing in Santa. It is measured by a \\"Clausometer\\" gauge in Santa's sleigh). Michael makes off with Santa's list. People are curious what is written in it. The television reporter is embarrassed when Michael reads what Santa was asked to give her. Then people start to sing, the Christmas spirit re-awakens, and the magic begins again.porter is embarrassed when Michael reads what Santa was asked to give her.

B000F4RHB6|5.0|Certainly, this is not much of a review. Huey Lewis is that kind light, bouncy, pop rock and roll that does not have much substance. However, I love to listen to him. This CD is a decent attempt to bring the hits together in one collection. The replication of material is acceptable as well.

Kieth Moon's drumming was outstanding on all these songs - at this stage of the Who they had matured into the best live band out there then and used that approch to recording this album the third time ( they tired a live show too that didn't work either ) - overall it may go down as the best Rock Album ever - Recording - Song Writing - Musicianship - It just the perfect Rock Album that all others are compared to - I guess that's debatible but probably true - not bad for a bunch of blokes from Sheppards Bush - it was a long hall mates - A lot of live shows - about 800 of Live Tommy Concerts up to this point - so they were pro's at making good Rock at this point - Pete Townsend went to Art College for a while when he was about 18 and still thinks as himself as a artist not just a musician - His approch then was as a artist with a Electric Guitar as his brush - A real good one too - John contributed My Wife as a song to the group a some what lame song from his first solo ablum - The Who's version was ten times better here - Pete's Bargin and Won't Get Fooled Again is the best to me - If your gonna buy three Who Albums I would get Live at Leeds - Who's Next - and Quadraphinia these are the best - The Delux version of Who's Next has from the second recording effort the Young Vic shows worth searchin out- I was 10 years old when this album came out and still remember the first time I heard Won't Get Fooled Again - I was on a swing listening to a transister radio at my granddads house - after the song went off the DJ said \\" a new one from The Who I don't know if I like that new sound I think Tommy was better to me -  I guess it takes time to like a new song I guess - to me Who's Next better - Out here in the fields  I pay my own bills I get my back into my living - I don't need to fight to prove I'm right  I don't need to be forgiven - Yeah Yeah Yeah     Great Album buy it
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|\\"Dexter\\" is a consistently entertaining melodrama of the Jacobean variety, what with its hero villain, amusingly dour view of the reigning power structure, and rich doses of dramatic irony. Essential to the series' success in all these areas, however, is the highly accomplished dialogue the skillful cast has been provided with and delivers to perfection.    The central figure Dexter, a forensics expert by day and a serial killer at night, is villainous yet oddly sympathetic, like a character out of Webster or Tourneur. In Dexter's case, his painful sense of his own emptiness and his consequent need to fake requisite emotions, \\"to prepare a face to meet the faces that one meets\\" in T.S.Eliot's words, is a startling extreme of an easily recognizable emotional state, the open sesame to audience identification with this hero-villain. His workplace, too, contains shocks of recognition for the audience, since the writers playfully expose there the widespread and ugly side of corporate competition, many characters in Dexter's Miami police department being only too eager to claim credit for the achievements of others on the staff. Finally, Dexter's hidden identity as a serial killer allows for some grand instances of dramatic irony. In particular, his girlfriend's often expressed confidence that she knows his character and that he'd be incapable of any action she'd disapprove of is about as ironically rich as irony gets.    \\"Dexter,\\" like \\"Rome,\\" is one of the writing triumphs of current cable TV. Its quality puts to shame not only most of the other fare on cable or  prole TV, but also the coterie art, burdened with stale identity politics, which passes these days for theater writing. A strange state of affairs, that the best dramatic writing these days is to be found not in a playhouse but on the tube!

B00005QZ7U|3.0|Moulin Rouge will for me always be an enigma.  A movie about a play about a love story which is metaphor for the actual plot of the film.  It's filled with over acting, underacting weird characters, strained voices, awkward and tender moments, choppy cuts, montages, grunge and pop songs reworked as musical theater numbers, and beautiful sets and costumes.  Upon seeing the opening credits (a conductor waving his baton in tandem to the 20th century Fox theme) my first thoughts were, \\"hasn't that been done before?\\"  This sentiment would prove to be well suited to the whole of the film.  Every few moments a scene, plot point, device, or musical number seemed to come up that I could swear I had already seen or heard in some other place.  And even when Nirvana lyrics were sung by a chorus line of tuxedo wearing men, while Christina Aguilara played in the background, and scenes of cartoon like decadence filled the screen, I couldn't help but be swept away by the pure and simple disparity of it all.  As far as performances go the only one worth really caring about is Kidman's.  While her lines may seem ham handed and the situations contrived, she delivers a stellar performance which manages to elevate this film to a level where it can be watched by people who are not consistently tripping on acid.
140120306X|1.0|I was disappointed by this one. Only a much too small part of the book consists of comic pages, delivering a framing story around the actual Black Dossier, which is like a scrapbook with a lot of text and a few unappealing drawings.

159102594X|5.0|I have always enjoyed character driven books in any genre, so ended up loving this fantasy debut novel.    The focus is more on the characters than on the world building, though the setting - a country with a senile king, being threatened by other nations from both the north and the south, is an interesting one.    Logen Ninefingers is a great barbarian character from the north,and not used to big cities. Jezal dan Luthar is a selfish and self centered young nobleman who wants to get ahead in the world. My favorite - Sand dan Glotka - is a tortured torturer who is always keeping a sarcastic and hilarious running commentary in his head.    Not a farm boy of destiny or noble hearted thief or nasty tempered princess in the lot. (Is anyone else out there tired of farm boys?)    All this said, though, the book is clearly a set up book for the rest of the trilogy.    I cannot wait for March and [[ASIN:1591026415 Before They Are Hanged (The First Law: Book Two)]].

B000ZN8036|3.0|I didn't love \\"Into the Wild\\", Sean Penn's new film based on the bestseller by Jon Krakauer.<br /><br />Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduates from Emory College, barely able to tolerate his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) attendance at lunch after the graduation. Eating with his parents and his sister (Jena Malone), he rebuffs their offer of a new car. What does he need a new car for? What does he need material possessions for? Chris embarks on a road trip, using the car to get as far West as possible. When it finally breaks down, he cuts up all of his ID, his credit card, and his driver's license and burns his cash and sets out on foot. His goal is to make it to Alaska and camp and commune with nature. He doesn't tell his parents where he is going, because they would surely send out people to track him down, so he gets a good months head start before they even realize he is gone. Along the way, he meets a couple of hippies (Catherine Keener an d newcomer Brian Dierker), a boss who becomes a friend (Vince Vaughn) and an elderly man who is extremely lonely (Hal Holbrook). Each of these people will help him with wisdom and insight along the way to his ultimate destination. Alaska. There, he finds an abandoned bus and sets up camp within the shelter.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" is an interesting story, and will hold your interest, but the directing style is extremely obtrusive and the lead character is a little too selfish to be likable.<br /><br />Based on a true story, there is apparently some debate about whether Chris' journey is an act of selfishness or self-discovery. I can see both sides of this argument. But I have to lean towards selfish. It is understandable, and identifiable, that he wants to get away from his parents. I think all people have had these feelings at least once in their life. And from our brief moments with his parents and some things we learn later, these feelings are understandable. But when Chris leaves, and doesn't communicate with his family, he also doesn't communicate with his sister. Throughout the film, we hear the sister provide voice over explaining what a close bond she and Chris share, how they coped with their parents, etc. Why wouldn't he call his sister at some point? The film is about his journey to Alaska, but he doesn't spend the entire film in Alaska. He is often near or has access to a phone. If he has such a close bond with his sister, it doesn't make sense that he would never call her, never send her a letter, never try to contact her and let her know he is all right.<br /><br />Penn has apparently wanted to make this film for a number of years. He only held off because he was waiting for the approval of the McCandless family. He finally got their approval and then made the film. The story is ripe with dramatic potential. A young man makes a journey of self-discovery, trying to fulfill his dream of living in the wilderness. But this dramatic potential is robbed, in many cases, because Penn uses a number of editing techniques and storytelling devices, which do nothing more than reinforce the feeling we are watching a film. Every time the actors start to approach anything near what the film should be, Penn splits the screen into a number of pictures, all showing Emile Hirsch as McCandless, and we immediately snap back to reality and realize \\"Hey, we're watching a film.\\" Split screens (think TV's \\"24\\"), slow motion photography and other camera tricks all serve to draw the viewer out of what should be a small, intimate portrait of a young man`s journey.<br /><br />I read an article about Eddie Vedder's contributions to the film. Penn asked him to write some music and liked it so much, he asked him to write more, and they put a number of songs in the film. These moments are meant to be more background music, to give a little texture to this film portrait of McCandless' life but they also detract from the young man's journey. Most of the songs are simply Vedder humming, ormaking a tune with his deep voice. Very few actually have words. So it just seems a little odd to hear these strange sounds, as we watch the journey of a young man traveling through the wilderness.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch does a very good job. \\"Wild\\" is about his character's journey, and he is on screen for the majority of the film, so it is essential that we feel what he feels. If we don't feel the joy, the peace, the danger and the fright he feels, we have nothing to identify with. In a film of this nature, there are no other characters in a majority of the film, so if we don't identify with Chris, we have nothing to help us enter the story, no one to take us on the journey.<br /><br />I liked Hirsch's performance. Hirsch is turning into a very strong actor. He and Justin Timberlake were the standouts in the underrated \\"Alpha Dog\\" and has appeared in a number of other little seen films and had roles in television shows. In \\"Into the Wild\\" Hirsch brings a maturity to the role hinting at some of the performances he will deliver, some of the roles in his future.<br /><br />There are three pit stops in his journey. He first meets Jan (Catherine Keener) and her partner Rainey (Brian Dierker), two hippies who live in a camper and like to set up stakes with a community of like minded individuals in the desert. They earn a few dollars here and there, mosey along the road, and meet new people. In their discussions, they talk about Jan's son, whom she hasn't seen for a long time. This is a nice compliment to Chris' journey. Jan's comments have to make Chris think about the effect he is having on his own parents. Keener, as always, does a great job with her relatively small role. Brian Dierker is also very good. He realizes the emotional troubles his partner has, and seems to love her all the more for them.<br /><br />Then Chris meets Wayne (Vince Vaughn). Wayne is a bit of a wild guy, and he has a business of his own, so he hires Chris. They get along and work well together and form a friendship. Throughout the film, we see a letter or two Chris writes to Wayne, the letters writing out on the screen in bright big letters (remember the comment about Penn's directing style earlier? Yet another example.) When we eventually meet Wayne and see the bond they form, these letters make sense.<br /><br />At the bar one night, as Chris is relating his reasons for making this journey, Wayne realizes Chris has a fire in his spirit, much like he does. But he also realizes Chris has to tame this fire, or it could lead to bad things. He provides some useful advice.<br /><br />Finally, Chris meets Ron (Hal Holbrook). Ron is an elderly man, who lives alone and offers to let Chris stay with him for a while. Ron and Chris form a friendship as well and when Chris is finally ready to move on, there is a touching moment when Chris and Ron have to say goodbye to one another.<br /><br />These three pit stops are meant to illustrate a different aspect of Chris' life or behavior. Yet, he doesn't seem to learn from them. Because he doesn't learn anything from them, what is the point of sitting through them?<br /><br />As Chris begins his journey, he decides to change his name to Alex Supertramp. Not sure why. When I initially saw this information in the trailer and put this together with the car he owns, I suspected the film was set in the late `60s or early `70s. Why would a kid in the `80s and `90s come up with an idea like this? Not sure, because we never really see or hear any reasoning behind this. He must just be one of those people who would probably be more comfortable in a different era.<br /><br />\\"Into the Wild\\" is interesting, and contains some interesting, moving performances, but it doesn't do a good job of portraying the journey of the main character.

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|As I am a die hard fan of Kapur's Elizabeth, I was overjoyed when I found out that they were releasing a sequel, with both Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush returning. I made sure that I saw it on the date it came out, but I left the theatre feeling disappointed.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is an entertaining and visually lush film. The costumes are beautiful, the music is nice, and Blanchett (though looking a little young for a queen who should have been in her 50s), Rush, Clive Owen (as Walter Raleigh), and Samantha Morton (as Mary Queen of Scots) all give wonderful performances. However, it still felt as if the movie had something missing.<br /><br />I know that the first Elizabeth was riddled with historical inaccuracies, but the movie contained so much plot and intrigue it allowed one to overlook its inconsistencies. Elizabeth: The Golden Age, however, falls short in that it focuses almost exclusively on the pseudo-romance between Elizabeth and Walter Raleigh (while Elizabeth did indeed have feelings for many of her male court favorites, Raleigh included, it was far from the fairy tale we see here) at the expense of leaving out many important characters and events. For example, where is Elizabeth's former love and best friend Robert Dudley? He is not even mentioned in this film, and it is a well known fact that not only did he participate in the Armada in 1588, he died later that same year, causing Elizabeth to stay shut in her room for days. Also missing is his stepson Robert Devereaux, the Earl of Essex, who was well on his way to becoming Elizabeth's golden boy.<br /><br />Inaccuracies aside, there was so much going on in the actual time of Elizabeth I's second half of her reign (The Golden Age) that it is quite sad that all we get to see in this film consists of Elizabeth and Raleigh flirting, dancing, and riding around on horseback together or Elizabeth whispering her fears and desires to the only lady-in-waiting who seems to have been of any degree of importance, Bess Throckmorton (later Bess Raleigh).<br /><br />The sad thing is, that with such talented actors, all this needed was a more fleshed out script and this could have come close to equalling its predecessor.of importance, Bess Throckmorton (later Bess Raleigh).     The sad thing is, that with such talented actors, all this needed was a more fleshed out script and this could have come close to equalling its predecessor.
B000VDDDY6|3.0|I'm loving the episodes (most of them).    The sound within the episodes is ok. The picture is clear, and the new effects shots are great...the show really benefits from the CG additions.    BUT NOW FOR THE BAD (or atleast annoying) - I'm only watching the DVD versions and Kirk's voice is relatively LOW in the opening - \\"SPACE...THE FINAL FRONTIER...\\"! (I don't have an HD player)    [...]    How can Kirk's voice be so low (and have a weird echo) and they call this \\"remastered\\"? This after all the trouble they went through re-recording the music and adding in Kirk's original dialogue which sounds normal on the bonus disc preview.     Oh well. That's my only real complaint.    Aside from that I still recommend these highly.
B000H0MKGK|3.0|I'm a baby-boomer who lived through and enjoyed the greatest era of rock music.  So I've been spoiled and don't usually get guys like John Mayer.  He used to look like he could get a start in a teenage road comedy but has morphed into a \\"hunk\\" (check out some of the girls he's had on his arm). I never noticed him on the radar screen until I saw him in Eric Clapton's Crossroads One DVD and realised he was a far better guitarist than I had ever thought;  which I found surprising for his generation - they don't usually play the guitar or like guitar music.    Which brings me to Continuum, which I heard recently playing in a \\"record\\" shop.  It didn't really grab me until I heard John's cover of Jimi Hendrix's Axis: Bold As Love, which John simply titles Bold As Love. I rushed over to enquire \\"Who is THAT!?\\".  Great interpretation (and I'm a huge Hendrix fan) and that track alone, for me, is worth the price of the album.  That's what I bought it for.  Bold As Love is John Mayer for baby-boomers.  Oh yes, and there are some other tracks on that album too.  I heard some of those ones playing in an elevator somewhere. Only half joking.    Now if John will do a Hendrix tribute album next time, of the softer more melodic Hendrix numbers, that would suit him and be great.  Eg Little Wing, The Wind Cries Mary, May This Be Love, maybe My Friend.  That line of country.  And John's a good enough guitarist to carry it off.  Not note for note covers (boring!) but John's interpretations, as he's ably done on Continuum.  But stay away from Purple Haze or \\"Slight Return\\", John, or you'll look like a clown.

B00015BJ0E|5.0|An unusual album from Milt Jackson and John Coltrane who you wouldn't expect to be playing with each other. Recorded in 1959 this was made just before 'Giant Steps', but its completely different from that classic album.<br /><br />With Jackson alongside Coltrane the whole album takes a much more bluesy turn especially when Jackson is playing, and indeed there a couple of blues tracks on the album. So when you hear Jackson on these tracks its the same Jackson who played with the MJQ and made a number of great albums with Oscar Peterson. However, Coltrane was pushing the boundaries at this stage, so the contrast between his solo on say 'The Late Late Blues' and Jackson's is quite dramatic.<br /><br />The supporting cast is, as you would expect top notch. On drums is Connie Kay, Bass is Paul Chambers and Piano is Hank Jones.<br /><br />My favourite track is 'Be-Bop', a Dizzy Gillespie tune taken at a frightningly fast tempo, on which Jackson swings through his solo with amazing panache and Coltrane (obviously in practise for things to come) just blasts through the chord sequence like it was a 12 bar (which its not).<br /><br />A great album that improves everytime you listen to it.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I am happy to say that the new Wes Anderson film \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is much better than his last film \\"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\\". But that is almost like damning the film with faint praise. It would be difficult for this film to be as bad as the director's last.<br /><br />That said, \\"Darjeeling\\" has some winning performances, some great humorous moments and seems to reintroduce us to the wacky sensibility that made us love the director in the first place. \\"Darjeeling\\" is not without it's problems, but it is a very funny and amusing film.<br /><br />Peter (Adrian Brody) runs to catch the Darjeeling Limited which is pulling out of a train station in a major Indian city. He soon joins his two brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis planned this trip, with the help of his beleaguered assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky, a former producer on \\"The Simpsons\\"), because they have not spoken in over a year. He misses their conversation, their sibling rivalry and their companionship. Francis has the entire trip planned, down to the religious ceremonies they will perform at various holy sights. But when the brothers start to act up, due to a variety of circumstances, including divergent personalities, over the counter medicines and a poisonous snake, the Chief Steward (Waris Ahluwalia) kicks them off the train in the middle of the dessert. Francis soon reveals his hidden agenda and they pull together to get through the trip and become brothers again.<br /><br />Each of Wes Anderson's films has a style unique to the filmmaker. Each of his films is populated by a collection of off-center people who live eccentric lives in an eccentric environment. Generally, his characters have money, either as a new circumstance or their bank accounts are dwindling, but they are still used to living a certain way. \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is no exception. From the moment we meet Francis, we begin to learn he has a company of his own, and feels the need to show this off by bringing his assistant along on the trip. Brenda will drop off their schedule every morning, under the door of their compartment, before they even wake up. They brought along a computer and laminating machine to aid in this task. As Jack runs to catch the train, he is carrying a couple of pieces of odd luggage, luggage that would probably be more comfortable in the hands of a child, each piece appears to have dinosaur stickers plastered over it. As he enters the compartment he will share with his brothers, we see many other pieces of the same luggage, all of it an exact match down to the monogram. Anderson goes to a lot of trouble to design every aspect of the universe his characters will inhabit. From what I understand, he designed every aspect of the train cars we see in the film. This attention to detail shows, giving the main setting for a significant portion of the film a character; these train compartments are interesting and unique, they appear like something we would expect to find in India, but are so gaudy and over decorated, like a British Lord initially commissioned them. Now independent, the Indians seem determined to uphold the tradition of the train cars while injecting their own indigenous traditions to the interior.<br /><br />Each of the three leads is good and adds significantly to the overall quirky nature of the film. Owen Wilson, who has been the focus of a number of tabloid stories lately, plays Francis, the more domineering brother. At dinner, he orders food for his brothers. And he is also the force behind the trip and their itinerary. He set-up the trip because he realized the three brothers were not communicating anymore and needed some bonding time.<br /><br />As the more domineering, fussy member of the family, Wilson's Francis is the least funny of the three. It doesn't help that Wilson's slow drawl sort of lends a whiny quality to his character. But he is still good. When the brothers get together, they slowly start to devolve into the children they once were and Francis finds his role, mother hen.<br /><br />Adrian Brody's Peter is an interesting guy. He agrees to go on the trip because he is having some trouble with his girlfriend back home and wants to escape for a while. A grown man, he is unable to hide his former self when he gets together with his brothers; Francis decides Peter should have the top bunk, his long legs dangling over the side and the gangly brother is chugging some over the counter Indian pain medicine, which his siblings begin to share. But Peter seems to recognize the need for the bonding time and goes along with his brother's overbearing plans.<br /><br />I have never been a huge fan of Jason Schwartzman, but he is also good as Jack, clearly the youngest brother. There are some references to his life as a successful writer, living in Paris, trying to get over his ex-girlfriend. Jack carries around a short story he just competed and eagerly seeks the approval of his other brothers.<br /><br />From the moment they board the train, Jack is smitten with Rita (Amara Karan), an employee on the train, a sort of stewardess who makes sure the guests have enough refreshments. She recognizes the look in Jack's eyes as he continues to pursue her.<br /><br />Anjelica Huston pops up in a small role as Patricia, a nun living in a small monastery at the foot of the Himalayas. Patricia once played a role in the lives of the three men and their visit with her is cathartic.<br /><br />As much as there is to love about \\"Darjeeling\\", it makes a similar mistake to \\"The Life Aquatic\\", a mistake that derails the Bill Murray film. Thankfully, the events in \\"Darjeeling\\" only prove to provide an odd side trip in their journey. A confusing side trip at that; the events really seem to have no connection to the brothers or their journey. I think the key difference here is \\"Life Aquatic\\" ends with this event, leaving us with this as our final memory. In \\"Darjeeling\\", the similar event happens earlier, giving us some story to help us forget the problematic part of the story.<br /><br />\\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" is a quirky, fun, funny look at three brothers on a road trip.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Great movie- Ideal for the Church History Buff. Deals with the Abbolishion movement in England . Deals with a portion of the life of John Newton And his predacissers in that movement. Good for older childern - Adult , ( may be to deated for younger childern).
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|Better read the book then watching the video.  I bet you, people that never read the book would never able understand the story in the video.
B000JLQSWE|4.0|This is, easily, one of the best albums by Alan Parsons Project.  It's not cool or easy to understand (some of the more critical reviews seem to think every album should be about horror poetry, pyramid mythology, or robots) but the lyrics offer up a pretty harsh indictment of the self-centered and, consequently, disassociated nature of individuals and the corporate-centered nature of the masses.  The music is, as always, solid and the production values are, inevitably, great.  The attempts at hits succeed, whatever the subject matter, because Alan Parson knows musical talent when he sees it and is a master at pulling everything together in the studio.  If you like strong music, incredible production values, and lyrics that explore real issues, this is The Alan Parson Project album for you.

B00102F5WK|3.0|Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) finishes a business conference in Johannesburg. As he gets in the cab for the airport, he realizes he missed a call on his cell phone from a private number. He calls his pregnant wife, Isabella (Reese Witherspoon), back in Chicago, who is playing a game of soccer with their son. Anwar's flight lands in Washington, DC, where he is scheduled to change planes, before arriving back home in Chicago. In Washington, DC, CIA Director Corinne Whitman (Meryl Streep) orders her people to grab Anwar as he changes planes; they suspect he may have ties to a terrorist who bombed a crowded square in a northern African country. After a few moments of interrogation, Anwar is shipped to the North African country where he is interrogated and tortured by the chief of police, Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor) on behalf of the CIA. A new CIA administrator, Douglas Freeman (Jake Gylenhaal) finds himself thrust into the role of interrogator when the interrogator is killed in the square bombing. There isn't time to find a replacement, so Douglas has to take over. When Isabella realizes her husband has vanished, she turns to an old school friend, Alan Smith (Peter Saarsgard) who works in the office of Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin) to see if he can help.<br /><br />\\"Rendition\\", written by Kelly Sane and directed by Gavin Hood (Academy Award Winner \\"Tsotsi\\"), wants to expose and dramatize a practice our country seems to be involved in, a practice we are learning more and more about. The film does cast a light on this murky area of our political engine, but it doesn't fully engage the audience in the characters and is weakened because of this. I don't think \\"Rendition\\" is powerful enough to get people to act.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is one of our greatest actresses and I would pay to watch her read the phone book. When I was describing this film to a co-worker, I brought up \\"Out of Africa\\" and the co-worker started to criticize Streep's performance as Issak Dinesen. I almost got into a fistfight when she made a comment about Streep's `fake accent'. Streep always makes any film she appears in better - good or bad, films benefit from the actresses ability to make a character come alive and her oft-noted ability to portray accents. Naturally, every performance is different and some work better than others. But they are all, at the very least, good. In \\"Rendition\\", she plays Whitman, the steely director of the CIA. She receives a call in the middle of the night; a bombing in a busy square in a North African country has killed one of their special interrogators. At the same time, they are tracking Anwar on his flight from South Africa. She instantly orders the suspect to be captured when he switches planes at Dulles. She wants him interrogated. When they can reach no conclusive answers and she is running out of time to hold him, she has him shipped back to the same North African country for interrogation. She is convinced she knows something.<br /><br />The scariest thing about Streep's character is her conviction she knows what she is doing is right. She never doubts it. For a minute. So when she is confronted by the man's wife, Isabella (Witherspoon), she calmly and coolly tells the young mother that she is sorry for the woman's trouble, but she knows nothing. She manages to almost convince us and we know differently.<br /><br />Her character also has more than a little depth. When the phone call wakes her up in the middle of the night, she calms her husband (Bob Gunton) much like a parent would a child. He dutifully appears at her side at a black tie event. These moments help to show Corrine has a personal life, making her more than simply a \\"villain\\".<br /><br />Reese Witherspoon is good as Isabella. Naturally distraught, she tries to find out the truth about her husband, while caring for their young son and their unborn child. She turns to a friend (Peter Saarsgard) who works in a Senator's office for help after she learns that herhusband got on the flight in South Africa but somehow never got off the flight at Dulles Airport. She finds credit card charges he made on the plane and then turns to the Senator's aide for help. As doors are continuously slammed in her face, she becomes more and more worried and more and more desperate.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Douglas Freeman, a new recruit for the CIA. Hired on as an Administrator, he quickly adjusts to life in the North African country, his new post. But the death of the agent who will be their new interrogator affects him and he is even more shocked to learn he will be taking the deceased man's place. When Nawal takes over the interrogation of Anwar, Douglas must watch the excessive techniques, challenging his convictions. He soon forms an opinion of the man's guilt or innocence and decides to act. This role is interesting, but I'm not sure it achieves the intended result. I feel we are supposed to see the futility of the actions through Douglas' eyes - He certainly doesn't like what they are doing, but he takes a long time to act, making the character a bit unsuccessful.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal has a few nice moments with the character. When his colleague dies, it clearly affects him. He is covered with the man's blood and has to take care of some business before he can even remove the shirt. After he does, we see his hands shake a bit as he goes through shock.<br /><br />Peter Saarsgard is good as Alan Smith, the Senator's aide, but his character gives up too easy. He is very determined to help Isabella, and even has the Senator's (Alan Arkin) ear for a while, but when Whitman gets to the Senator, everything changes and Peter is warned to stay away. If he believes in Anwar's innocence, why doesn't he fight more? If he doesn't believe in Anwar's case, why does he fight at all? Due to his past relationship with Isabella?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Rendition\\" deals with the narrative. As we flip back and forth between the various characters, we also follow the story of Nawal's headstrong teenaged daughter, Fatima. Nawal doesn't want her to see a new boyfriend, Khalid, so she runs away, to live with him. As Nawal continues to search for her, we see the interrogation of Anwar and also the story of Fatima and Khalid's growing love. As they become more involved, Khalid takes her to a student demonstration and introduces her to some of his friends, friends who would rather remain anonymous. Nawal continues to try to find her, but has little luck. This story dovetails into the rest of the narrative, with the help of a sloppy device, and doesn't seem to do anything other than detract from the rest of the story.<br /><br />We are supposed to see a parallel between Fatima and Khalid and the interrogation of Anwar, but beyond the obvious, there really isn't any.<br /><br />Because of the large handful of characters we follow through the course of the film, each is equivalent to a supporting character. Supporting characters have less time on screen, less time to make us believe in their character and less time to make us really care for their character. Because we don't feel a strong bond or connection to Isabella or Anwar, his torture doesn't have the impact on us it should.<br /><br />\\"Rendition\\" is good, but it isn't the film that will move us to take action.a but somehow never got off the flight at Dulles Airport.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is the last of the trilogy, I only wish they would produce about three more.  Your on the edge of your seat throughout this movie.  Just a great series.  I wish there were more of this type of good acting.  The industry needs more Jason Bourne.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|I can't add anything new to what has already been said. I can only say I've waited ( along with everyone else ) these many years for the promise that this movie was coming to dvd to come true. It is finally going to happen in a edition that may well make that wait worthwhile. A epic that makes you care thanks to the amazing acting by all involved. HAPPY NEW YEAR INDEED.
B00005JPTI|2.0|!!!!spoiler alert!!!! !!!!spoiler alert!!!! !!!!spoiler alert!!!! !!!!spoiler alert!!!! !!!!spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />  I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I really like and look up to will smith.  He has been good since he first stared being seen and heard.  I saw this had gotten a few reviews of like 7.9 and 65%, but I like to judge movies myself and not just read something may not be good and shut it off.  My mother and I went to see this movie and it started at 12pm.  After all the crap they make you watch before the movie actually starts, let us say the movie started at 12:15.  I looked at my cell and it was 1.19pm.  I thought \\"holy man\\" this movie is going by SO fast and it has been good so far.  Then, it happened.  For the rest of the movie it dragged on and on and on.  When we left we talked about it on the way home or wear ever we were going.  There was so much that was unexplained in the film.<br /><br />  Now for the break down.  The movie was about a lady who had found a cure for cancer.  She was telling how many thousands of people were going to get to use the trials.  Then you see the world sometime later and it's deserted.  There is one man and a dog.  Now you would think that a movie with a man and a dog would get boring.  But it did not.  At first.  It turns out that smiths character was a scientist.  He was stll trying to find a cure for the disease even when he thought no one was alive.  There were humans left but they had gotten sick from the drug that the lady had made.  Here was one of the problems.  They made the people look like aliens or monsters.  I understand if they get sick and look all bug eyed.  But these things looked like they came from another planet.  Later in the movie, (when these \\"creatures\\" were chasing smith) he was on like the 3rd or 4th floor.  They started climbing up the damn walls.  Just scaling outside walls with nothing to hold onto.  The movie did not explain how or why the hell these \\"HUMANS,\\" \\"who were supposed to have only gotten sick from a new medicine.\\"  Could climb up walls.  They showed the faces of these things a few times and they made them look like they knew they were evil and trying to kill people.  So that was strange and got me thinking.  Then it never really explained how smiths character was immune to the virus.  So now you are left thinking about two pretty important things.  Don't you all worry, because these are not the only things that made me give this a 2.  Then there's smiths dog.  Cretin animals were immune to the air born virus but not if they were bitten.  Never explained this, nor did they mention why the sickened people had turned into what looks like vampires (because if they bite you, you would get the virus) or zombies (because the way they looked and walked.)  So after all this I said \\"ok guess it will explain everything later on.\\"  The movie continued.  Smiths character had been putting out radio on am and finally he was knocked out and awoke with a woman and child helping him.  The lady said she had herd his message.  She said there was a bunch of people in a camp some wear.  Smith yelled and told her that there were no people.  She was going to go and leave him there.  Well in the end the zombie-pire-human type things had followed them to the place they were staying one night.  Did I mention that these human some how could not go into sunlight.  So they had to travel only at night?  So The evil hums started to get into the house and smith hid the lady and her sun, found a grenade and as soon as the zoms shattered the glass that was protecting him.  He threw it.  Killing himself and the zombies.  Then it shows the lady found the military base, with other people mind you and was safe.  She was talking about smiths character \\"who she said was 50 something,\\" they did a bad job of making him look as old as he was supposed to be had died saving the cure.  Even though he gave her the cure and died for nothing.  When the movie ends, you will more than likely be like UM.  Actually a man in the theater we were in said \\"OK\\" as I was walking out.  The movie was only like an hour and 40 minutes.  Perhaps if it had been longer like 2 hours and 40 minutes.  They could have explained more.  But this movie tried to be to many different kinds of movie.  If they had made it only about people getting sick and dying, and a man sill ok trying to find a cure.  It probably would have been better.  But there are so many unanswered questions and things that make no sense, that it is hard to enjoy.  I know I will never watch it again.  I am a collector of movies and I shall not buy this one.  Will if you ever read this, I think you are one of the best actors I have seen in my 22 years of life.  So keep up the good work.  You acted great in this film.  It just didn't play well with you.ill more than likely be like UM.  Actually a man in the theater we were in said \\"OK\\" as I was walking out.

B000YENUI6|4.0|From the first frames, \\"Eastern Promises\\" grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go.<br /><br />\\"A History of Violence\\" is one of my favorite films. Director David Cronenberg brings together a top-notch cast, including Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello as a married couple living in small town America who has to contend with some new and unexpected violence. William Hurt turns in an Oscar worthy performance as a mobster and Ed Harris is pretty scary as a determined gangster ready to extract revenge for past misdeeds. What makes \\"Violence\\" so great is Cronenberg's ability to make everything seem so real. We believe Mortensen and Bello are married. They are sexy, happy, love each other, have kids they love, seem content. When the act of violence occurs, and Mortensen's character becomes a hero, he earns unwanted media attention leading to a confrontation with the gangsters. As the danger escalates, and secrets are revealed, we care more and more about Mortensen's and Bello's characters. Is the film violent? Yes, but these scenes play a significant role in the overall story. Amazingly, \\"A History of Violence\\" is based on a graphic novel.<br /><br />Cronenberg and Mortensen apparently liked working  together so well they reteam for \\"Eastern Promises\\".<br /><br />Anna (Naomi Watts), a midwife at a hospital in London, treats a young pregnant woman a few nights before Christmas. When the mother dies, the midwife looks through her belongings, trying to find the address of family, to care for the newborn child. All she finds is a diary filled with entries written in Russian and a business card for a restaurant called Trans-Siberian. The next day, she rides her motorcycle to this restaurant and meets the owner, Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl). He is preparing a large feast for his extended family but can spare a few moments. He listens to Anna's story and is sorry he can't help. Anna thanks him for his time and mentions she will have her uncle translate the girl's diary, to see if they can find an address. Diary? Semyon tells her to bring the diary to him the next day, he will help translate it. As she leaves the restaurant, Anna meets Nikolai (Mortensen) and Kiril (Vincent Cassel). Kiril is the son of Semyon and considers himself the prince of the crime family his father has built. Nikolai is his friend, and a `driver' for the organization. Anna realizes these people are part of the Russian mob, but continues to run into them, ignoring her mother's pleas to stay away. As if the problem of the dead girl is not enough, Semyon must deal with Kiril's murder of a Chechen gangster. How can he protect his son?<br /><br />I read a story about \\"Eastern Promises\\" quoting Cronenberg disputing the film is very violent. His argument was something along the lines of \\"There are only three scenes of violence\\". It's enough, David. It's enough. Cronenberg is a very good director, one of the most consistent working in film today. When he makes a film, he strives to make it as authentic as possible. If the film contains violence, he wants it to be authentic. Those three scenes are graphic, scary and very believable because they are portrayed in such a believable fashion. This is not the only aspect of the film worth mentioning, and the violence is an integral part of the story and these characters lives, but these scenes will linger in your memory for a while, much as they have mine. One scene in particular is so memorable, and something I am sure you have never seen before, that it might just become one of those scenes people keep referring to. It involves Nikolai fighting with some gangsters, in a steam bath, and Nikolai is buck-naked. Yes, Viggo Mortensen is buck-naked. I think I just sold a number of tickets. I want a commission.<br /><br />But Cronenberg doesn't shrink away from showing the consequences of violence. If someone gets slashed with a razor, they bleed. If someone gets punched, you almost feel it in your gut. Anyone who has seen any of Cronenberg's other films realizes this is mild in comparison to some of the things he has showed in his earlier work. But it is no less effective considering his current films deal with more real people and their situations.<br /><br />Cronenberg has really been exploring the relationships of his characters in his last few films, to a greater extent than he used to. Or perhaps his skill has developed to the point where these elements of his films seem to take a more prominent role. In either case, his films seem more human, the characters more vulnerable.<br /><br />One such character is Nikolai, played by Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen's roles in each of Cronenberg's films are similar in one regard; each man has a streak of vulnerability. In \\"A History of Violence\\", it is much more noticeable. In \\"Eastern Promises\\", Nikolai is a tough guy, a `driver' who processes their victims to make sure they are unidentifiable. But there are moments when we become aware of his vulnerability. When he meets Anna, he tries to protect her from what he knows is about to happen. He realizes she is an honest person, a nice person, and doesn't belong in this world.<br /><br />Nikolai's vulnerability is almost always revealed just before or just after an act of violence which helps to show why he is so good at what he does, why he is such a ferocious fighter, determined to win. He has to prove he is a tough guy, to stay in this crowd.<br /><br />As the film continues, we begin to learn little things about Nikolai, making him a more complex character. Nikolai is very interested in becoming a soldier for this `family' and will do just about anything anyone tells him to. This means he has to listen to Kiril and follow his sometimes crazy, out of left field instructions. He also has to do whatever Semyon says, to prove he is a worthy addition to the family. But why is he so interested in joining this family?<br /><br />Naomi Watts does a good job as Anna, the second generation Russian who is completely British. When she initially confronts this problem, she cares for the dead girl. But she goes beyond this, to try to help reunite her orphaned girl with family for more complex reasons. We learn she may have more in common with this girl, giving them a stronger bond, making her efforts more meaningful.<br /><br />Anna lives with her mother (Sinead Cusack) who worries about her daughter's involvement with these people. She knows they are part of the Vory V Zakone brotherhood and her late husband related stories about their notorious deeds. Her brother-in-law, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) is a more recent Russian immigrant and stays with them on a frequent basis. When he first learns of the diary, he takes a look through the pages and becomes horrified at what is described. He wants nothing to do with it. But then his interest gets the better of him. When he realizes whom the young lady was dealing with, he tries to protect Anna, as much as an old man can.<br /><br />Armin Mueller- Stahl (\\"Avalon\\", \\"The Music Box\\", \\"Shine\\") plays Semyon, the head of this organized crime family. His ornate, elaborate restaurant is both a sanctuary and a place to hold court. Filled with rich red velvet, silver place settings, huge paintings and tapestries, it looks like a restaurant that has been around a long, long time. How else could it make any money? But it also looks like a festive place, a place for family celebrations and parties. Semyon is the head of this empire and he reflects all of these images as well. He is the benevolent host, the stern businessman, and the dangerous head of a criminal organization.<br /><br />Mueller - Stahl is very good, perhaps Best Supporting Actor good. Semyon is a man of many faces and Mueller - Stahl is able to portray these in a way making his character both more realistic and more interesting. When he first meets Anna, we realize he is holding back information, trying to see what she has. When he realizes she has the young girl's diary, he triesto get it from her through friendly persuasion. He doesn't want to harm her. But we know he could. He simply wants to protect himself, his family and his `family'. And we recognize that he will do whatever is necessary to do this.<br /><br />Semyon is the head of the organized crime family, but has to play ambassador to the other people in the family. He has to pay heed to what they want and need. But if Semyon wants something done. It gets done. Semyon is an interesting character because Mueller - Stahl is able to make all of the different facets of his character known, yet in a subtle way.<br /><br />And Semyon has to deal with his son, Kiril. Played by Vincent Cassel (\\"Read My Lips\\", \\"Derailed\\"), Kiril is the least successful character. The most dramatic, he is also the most excitable, and can be seen as the most over dramatic. I get it. He is supposed to be immature, impulsive and insecure. But Cassel waves his arms around like a cartoon character. Kiril is over the top, but we also get it, a little, so this makes up for the over-the-top aspect, a little.<br /><br />I have given a number of reasons in support of my claim that Cronenberg is one of the best filmmakers working today. Let me close with one last reason. As we watch \\"Eastern Promises\\", a sly shift in the narrative happens. Actually, there are a few. In the hands of a less accomplished filmmaker, these moments would simply fall apart and make us groan. In \\"Eastern Promises\\", they serve to excite the viewer of the possibilities. Naturally, to talk about either, and they are related, in a way, would spoil them. You shall have to experience them for yourselves.l.

B000P12LWY|4.0|I just finished watching the entire first season of \\"The Tudors.\\" When the show first premiered on Showtime, I watched the pilot episode and never bothered to watch it again. I thought the show was visually appealing, but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste. However, I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII, and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation. I watched all the episodes of \\"The Tudors\\" On Demand in less than a week, and I really enjoyed them.<br /><br />In order to appreciate this program, you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is. Yes, the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events, but this is a cable television series, and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience. As a result, all of the people in King Henry's court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life, and there are some major alterations to historical timelines. Still, I'm impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show, and overall, it's very engaging to watch. The pacing is exciting and fast...perhaps a little too fast, in my opinion. For example, Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Blount gets knocked up with Henry's illegitimate child in the very first episode, and by the second episode, she's already giving birth. I wonder how long \\"The Tudors\\" can realistically continue to air with such a rushed chain of events.<br /><br />For the most part, I think the casting of the show is excellent. I've never been a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers until now, but his portrayal of Henry VIII is intense, dramatic, and exciting. Sam Neill is brilliant as the two-faced Cardinal Wolsey, and Natalie Dormer is perfect as the bewitching Anne Boleyn. As far as the characterizations of these famous characters goes, I think Henry VIII has been a bit one-sided in Season 1. I'll be interested to see how Meyers tackles the role when Henry finds himself betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for. It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry. Also, I think Anne has actually been pretty likable so far...hopefully she'll become a much darker character in Season 2.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed \\"The Tudors\\" much more than I thought I would. It's entertaining, and people who enjoy learning about this period in history will definitely get a kick out of it. I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of Season 2.betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for. It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry.

B0000062S0|5.0|This is the last Led Zeppelin album. The songs grow on  you with time and are all really great. Almost a decade after I bought this album I still love listening to it. i wish I could have heard these songs live. Zeppelin should get back together because life is too short and rock n' roll needs them as well as other classic rock bands. I hear rumors of a new album somewhere down the road, and if that's going to happen I hope they'd really do it right and make some bold social statements and offend a lot of people. These days, a lot of people need to be awakened from their spiritual slumbers.

B000ZOXDFA|3.0|\\"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\\", the second part of a planned trilogy, features Cate Blanchett reprising her Academy Award nominated role from almost ten years ago. She is very good, she is always good, and one of three actresses I would watch read the phone book. The other two are Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren. And Clive Owen is suitably dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but \\"The Golden Age\\" is lacking. In many ways.<br /><br />In 1998, \\"Elizabeth\\" caused a sensation because Blanchett turns in an electrifying performance. Also, the film is stunningly gorgeous. And it continues our fascination with British royalty by depicting a small part of perhaps the most interesting monarch's reign. It was also our first visit to this oft-filmed monarch's life in a while, so it was interesting, refreshing and new to watch this director's and this actor's interpretation of the role. Since then, HBO produced a multi-part miniseries featuring Helen Mirren playing the same role. With more than six years between the two projects, we had enough time to give Mirren fresh eyes for her interpretation of the same monarch. The HBO project covers much of the same ground as 1998's \\"Elizabeth\\" but also goes further, to show her facing down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart, the Spanish king and more. Now less than two years after this memorable turn, we have \\"The Golden Age\\" featuring Blanchett playing Elizabeth as she faces down assassination attempts, Mary Stuart and the Spanish King's threats to invade England. Due to the proximity of the two films, \\"The Golden Age\\" draws unfavorable comparisons.<br /><br />\\"The Golden Age\\" seems `light' somehow. Like the force behind the story of the first film and the force of the production as a whole has been diluted. The film has more than one shot of Blanchett in an elaborate costume standing in the middle of a room as the camera circles her. This is interesting the first time, but when it happens a couple of times, it dilutes the power of this vision. We get it. Elizabeth has the weight of the country on her shoulders. And as queen, she gets to wear some amazing outfits. But when the shot is repeated, it seems designed to show off the costumes and appear to be filler rather than to help the story.<br /><br />Blanchett is, as always, good. She is one of those actors who I think are incapable of giving a bad performance. Sure, they have appeared in bad films, but they are always interesting. As Elizabeth, she plays a character that seems tailor made for her, to accentuate the regal bearing of the actress. But in \\"The Golden Age\\", many of Elizabeth's best moments, her most powerful, were just portrayed by Mirren. Unfortunately, there are almost identical scenes and this really does \\"The Golden Age\\" and Blanchett a disservice.<br /><br />Blanchett is a forceful personality and it is fun to watch her flirt and hold court. She really shows us many aspects of the monarch's character and life. But we don't get a feeling for the character's Virgin Queen status. Yes, we see her suitors and there are a couple of mentions made of this fact, the Queen's unmarried and unable to sire an heir, but it doesn't seem to be the pressing need we have come to believe. Too bad, because this is a fairly important part of her life. And it was a big part of Mirren's performance. Instead, \\"The Golden Age\\" concentrates on the impending conflict with the King of Spain.<br /><br />Enter Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh. Upon his arrival at Elizabeth's court, he introduces himself and announces he has just returned from the New Land and named a colony Virginia, after the Queen. His gifts include potatoes and he brings two Native American Indians with him. But the impending threat of Spain changes Raleigh's actions; initially, he seems attracted to the Queen, and she him, but then his affections turn towards a younger member of the Queen's court, the Queen's most trusted friend.<br /><br />As Spain prepares their armada for war, Raleigh jumps into action and begins to help the smaller British fleet defend England. As the Spanish ships attack, Owen swings from ship to ship, channeling the spirit of Errol Flynn. He even appears a little like the former swashbuckler film hero. The actor brings a dashing quality to the character, making him a bit of a rogue, a bit of a hero, a bit of the bad boy. It is no wonder the Queen falls for him.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush returns as Sir Francis Walsingham, the Queen's advisor. As he is sick throughout most of the film, he mostly stands by her side, raising his arched eyebrow when he doesn't agree or approve of something the monarch has said or done.<br /><br />Rhys Ifans has a brief role as Robert Reston, a Catholic plotting to kill Protestant Elizabeth on behalf of the Catholic king of Spain. And Samantha Morton plays Mary Stuart, the woman at the center of many of Elizabeth's headaches.<br /><br />\\"The Golden Age\\" is beautiful to look at; the filmmakers have gone to great lengths to recreate the royal palaces and London of Elizabeth's age. The ships in the Spanish and British fleets are also particularly impressive. During the battle between the two fleets, we get a real sense for what life was like on these ships. Life and death.<br /><br />But the film fails to fully engage us in the story. If you go to see this film, you probably have at least a rudimentary grasp of the history of these events. So the film should not have to work hard to engage us in the lives of Elizabeth, Sir Walter Raleigh and the Queen's court. It should work hard to give us insight into the woman's life, the woman's thoughts, and the woman's feelings. But instead, it seems to want to focus more on the action-packed parts of the story, to make it more of an action film. It is almost seems like the filmmakers would like to recast Elizabeth in the mold of Sarah Connor, the role created by Linda Hamilton in \\"The Terminator\\" films. This doesn't work and detracts from the already interesting elements of the story.<br /><br />\\"Elizabeth - The Golden Age\\" is a bit of a wash.

The police are concerned by some mysterious murders going on especially a recent discovery of a dead 13 year old girl at the park, can the cops find the killer or will the psychopath get his bloody hands on the entire household?<br /><br />Suspenseful and masterful psychological horror slasher thriller is a true masterpiece of the horror genre and is the 70's questinnel slasher movie besides \\"Halloween\\" and Mario Bava's \\"Bay of Blood\\" but this was before John Carpenter's classic movie \\"Halloween\\" ever came to the big screen 4 years later. co-starring John Saxon, this movie from writer-director Bob Clark (who later went on to do \\"Porky's\\" and \\"A Christmas Story\\") is a chilling and scary skincrawler that will make you keep guessing till the very end on who is the killer. Unlike many slasher movies that needs extreme gore, this one focuses on characterizations and genuine suspense without being over the top gory, it's one horror movie that deserves it's cult following and is a must see for fans of the genre as it paved the way for major slasher films for years to come such as \\"Halloween\\", \\"Friday The 13th\\", \\"Sleepaway Camp\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Silent Night DeadlY Night\\", \\"Maniac\\", \\"The Burning\\", \\"Saw\\" etc. and a must own as it definitely ranks with \\"Psycho\\".<br /><br />This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with good extras like a Documentary, seperate interview segments with the stars and midnight screening Q&A with Margot Kidder, Bob Clark and John Saxton.

B00005JLCI|3.0|Kenneth Branagh's unabridged version of \\"Hamlet\\" is a mixed blessing. The most favorable components of this movie are the opulent sets and costumes, the striking photography, and an attractive cast.  (It's especially gratifying to see the gifted and still beautiful Julie Christie in a movie after an absence of too many years.)  But Branagh's movie falls way short of the brilliance and verve of Laurence Olivier's moody and exhilarating condensed version of \\"Hamlet\\" filmed in 1948. There are too many dull scenes in Branagh's movie where the scenary is more interesting than the characterizations particularly that of Hamlet.    Olivier's intensity and commanding presence, his classical handsomeness, and sex appeal were electrifying in the 1948 version of \\"Hamlet\\" which Olivier also directed.  By comparison, Branagh often seems to blend into the background or is overpowered by the sets.  Olivier's ease and dexterity with Shakespearean verse and his ability to morph into and become anyone of Shakespeare's grand protagonists was legendary and second to none.  This is why Olivier is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest actors of all time, a genius at that.      The same cannot be said for Branagh.  He seems out of his emotional depth in this movie.  Whereas Olivier exuded torment because of Hamlet's knowledge of his father's murder, Branagh comes across as merely annoyed.  Olivier's madness as Hamlet was frightening while Branagh's example of insanity seems like flighty goofiness.  He's not threatening enough.   Olivier transcended acting while Branagh either underacts or overacts the part.    Still, this 1996 version of \\"Hamlet\\" is entertaining but it is not the masterpiece that Olivier's \\"Hamlet\\" is.

068480025X|3.0|\\"Five Past Midnight\\" was my first James Thayer novel.  If it's representative of his work, he has good command of the language, spins a nice yarn, and backs up his story with historical accuracy.<br /><br />Mr. Thayer could have elevated his novel to something outstanding, but appears to have settled for the merely solid.  (Think good television miniseries versus great film.)  None of the main characters is ever really fleshed into anything more than a two-dimensional representation, and the protagonist, Jack Cray, is both flat and hard to credit as realistic.  While it's plausible that he might be as resistant to pain as he is described, his role as the Allies' most potent and deadly commando is starkly at odds with his constant do-gooderism toward Germans behind enemy lines.  Cray also pulls off a series of miraculous escapes with little lingering ill effect, and is so impervious to harm that there is a shortage of suspense about how he will come through in the end.<br /><br />Also flat are Katrin von Tornitz and Otto Dietrich - the \\"good Germans\\" - who are portrayed as never having supported the Nazi regime in any sense.  They were simply swept along by events, and Katrin too predictably falls for Cray.  Interestingly, while most of the other Germans might as well be wearing black hats in their roles as villains, Mr. Thayer's depiction of Hitler himself is reasonably realistic and complex, including his megalomania and paranoia, but also his personal charm.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and may well check out other works by the author, but there are elements of this story that could certainly be stronger.  I recommend \\"Five Past Midnight,\\" but the reader should go in knowing that if you tend - as I do - toward Alan Furst, Len Deighton, and John Le Carre for your stories of intrigue, while above average, this is definitely a notch below the top ranks.
0393061310|3.0|\\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is a decent book, and Diamond makes arguments based primarily on the geographic outlay of the world and relates that to how and why certain civilizations thrived and developed faster than others.  This is an interesting concept, and one that I had never thought about before.  Beyond that though, the book gets a bit slow.    I would recommend reading Diamond's \\"Collapse\\" in lieu of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".  I found \\"Collapse\\" to be much more interesting as Diamond explores the reasons civilizations have failed.  Often these reasons are related to said civilizations destroying their environments and devouring all of their resources to the point of the civilization's extintion.  These were sophisticated and arguably advanced civilizations which still destroyed themselves.  Very relevent to today's world.    \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" = How did we get here?  \\"Collapse\\" = Where are we headed?     The first question is interesting.  The second question is essential to survival.
B00005JO9J|5.0|BUY IT! Season One obviously sets up the proceeding seasons and although it's a short season, you just can't miss it. To see Meredith and Derek fall in love, to begin to understand how broken their spirits are and to see them try to explore and ignore what their issues are is just good TV. It's the beginning of how all of the main characters will fall into all of these things as well in the coming seasons. The human nature and emotional situations are very real to life but I would certainly love to see at least some of them get some therapy!
B000002GGW|4.0|Not bad at all I would say.  The title track is one of the best ever maid by Supertramp, it stands well in front of Fool's Overture in my opinion.  Better days is another great track.  Overall, this is a very good cd from Supertramp.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|\\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is as deliciously evil as a meat pie stuffed with human flesh, a macabre musical thriller that actually looks about as sinister and brooding as it feels. Director Tim Burton is definitely in his element, here, giving an even greater stylistic touch to a story that had plenty of style to begin with: he turns nineteenth-century London into a bleak landscape of shadow, filth, poverty, and cobblestone; he has everyone and everything existing in muted shades of gray, the gloomy monotony of which is occasionally broken by spurts of bright red blood; he once again relies on the talents of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, both of whom not only give excellent performances, but also prove that they have decent singing voices (although I must admit that Depp is better than Carter). This adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical play is both ghoulish and gleeful, a tragic story heightened with a few well-placed scatterings of dark humor.<br /><br />The story begins as Benjamin Barker (Depp) returns to London after a long imprisonment in Australia. He was once a happy man, a barber living with his wife, Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly), and newborn daughter, Johanna, in peace and contentment. Everything changed when the unscrupulous Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and his pompous right hand man Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) conjured up phony charges to have Barker arrested and sent to prison--Turpin grossly mistreated Lucy and ultimately raised Johanna as his ward. And since Lucy was driven to poisoning herself, Barker has absolutely no one to come home to. He's now consumed by hate, sorrow, and the need for vengeance against the Judge, feelings so intense that the man once known as Benjamin Barker no longer exists. Sweeney Todd is his name now.<br /><br />Upon returning to Fleet Street and his closed barbershop, he meets Mrs. Lovett (Carter), the talkative, dark-eyed owner of a shop specializing in meat pies. Times are hard for her because, by her own admission, she makes the worst pies in London; she gives Todd a disgusting lump of crust, inside of which is a putrid bit of meat that came from God knows where. Business for her rival--the unseen Mrs. Mooney--is booming while Mrs. Lovett's only customers have been the cockroaches infesting the shop. But when Todd enters her life, a dramatic reemergence is set into motion. How, exactly? Todd, you see, has become fatalistic and homicidal, using his precious silver-handled razors to slit the throats of every customer wanting a shave; this, in turn, benefits Mrs. Lovett, since dead bodies are an excellent source of meat for her pies. Needless to say, scores of hungry customers are soon gobbling up the most delicious pastries they've ever tasted.<br /><br />But Todd is far from satisfied because his real target is Judge Turpin, who's actively engaged in his own subplot. Locked within his home is Johanna (Jayne Wisener), who has since grown into a beautiful young woman ... so beautiful that Turpin no longer wants her as his ward, but as his wife. All that stands in his way is Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower), a young sailor who had already rescued Todd on a sea voyage. With a little help from Todd and Mrs. Lovett, he now hopes to rescue Johanna and marry her. Little does he know of what Todd has done and what he intends to do; revenge is a nasty business, too nasty for buried emotions to resurface. Simply put, Todd is no longer able to care about anyone or anything, least of all Mrs. Lovett, whose growing affection for him is becoming overbearing. All he has left is his hate, his razors, and a slew of throats to use them on.<br /><br />It's not surprising that it takes a lot of artistry to tell a story like this: Colleen Atwood's costumes are a combination of the delicate and the drab, and they capture the essence of what we imagine nineteenth century clothing to be; Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and Dante Ferretti's production designs turn London intoa murky world of despair; Sondheim's underscore--clearly influenced by Bernard Hermann--is tense and dramatic. But Burton's artistry is by far the most important; his eccentric visuals haven't been this effective since 1999's \\"Sleepy Hollow,\\" another story that made use of bleak, gray landscapes.<br /><br />Sondheim fans will note that the film's soundtrack is a streamlined version of the Broadway original, the most prominent loss being \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.\\" Burton fans will note that composer Danny Elfman is in no way involved with this film, Sondheim having written the original score as well as the song music. But when compared to the film's positive aspects, these are mere nitpickings. Take, for example, Sacha Baron Cohen as Signor Adolfo Perilli, a phony, flashy Italian barber: he provides the story with its most blatant display of comedy, flaunting an ego even larger than London itself. Also consider Ed Sanders as Toby, a boy no older than eleven: starting out as Perilli's servant, he's taken in by Mrs. Lovett as her shop's newest worker. His affection for her is genuine, which, considering her feelings for Todd, is actually quite sad.<br /><br />But it's the film's visual and musical styles that work the best. \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a stylish, grim fable that begins and ends with blood. What a perfectly graphic framing device, especially since blood in a Tim Burton film is brighter and redder than anything reality has to offer. This film actually manages to indulge in blood without turning it into gore; what's normally a disgusting body fluid is now beautiful paint on a dim canvas of sickly gray skin. The customers featured in the Broadway musical sing, \\"God, that's good!\\" at the beginning of act two--those are pretty much my sentiments about this film adaptation.eim's underscore--clearly influenced by Bernard Hermann--is tense and dramatic.

B000K15VSA|5.0|I'm not going to rate the movie itself. I have already done that months ago. The five stars that I am giving are for the sheer presentation and production value of this collector's set.    Since the director's cut in 1992, there has been a bone of contention among fans of the film, and that was; which version is better? The one with the voiceover or the one without?    It doesn't matter because you get to choose which version you want to watch, PLUS one version that no one has ever seen before (the Final Cut) and one version that has not been seen by most (the workprint). You also get the 1992 director's cut, the original 1982 US theatrical release, and the 1982 international release. Five, count 'em, FIVE versions of the film to please everyone's tastes. You want voiceover and a happy ending? You got it. You want no voiceover and a gloomy ending? You got it. You want Deckard's unicorn dream sequence or do you prefer a half-drunk Deckard plinking away on the piano and staring at old family photos? Either way, you got it. NOW, STOP COMPLAINING!!!!!!!!!!    There are also numerous documentaries and behind-the-scenes featurettes from the past as well as some recorded for this new DVD edition. They are all VERY insightful and give you a whole new appreciation for what everyone went through to make Blade Runner a reality. How everyone managed NOT to kill one another during the film's production is beyond me. There are also a few really nice deleted scenes that give a bit more depth to the world that Ridley Scott had created.    With that out of the way, this masterpiece of sci-fi celluloid has finally been given a proper home video treatment after 25 years. Let's start with the case.    VERY nice. It's made of sturdy plastic, but painted to look like it's made of brushed aluminum. It resembles Deckard's Voight-Kampf case, but a slightly smaller version. The Blade Runner title logo and Harrison Ford's name is printed with raised lettering on the top cover.    When the case is opened, the first thing you seem to notice is the shiny origami unicorn replica (also made of plastic) and the spinner replica. Both are very detailed, not some cheap piece of junk that I was originally expecting. The \\"toys\\" are packed inside form-fitting foam (say THAT fast 3 times!) next to the DVD box which contains 5 discs. The DVD box itself is very nicely done with conceptual art and screen shots from the film on the inside covers. Each disc has different screenshots from the movie on them as well and are nicely presented.    On the inside top cover is a dossier-like folder containing conceptual art by Syd Mead on one side, and an actual screenshot of the corresponding artwork brought to life in the film itself on the other. There is also a \\"holographic motion art\\" mini-plaque that shows Deckard drawing his blaster just before entering his apartment to find a sleeping Rachael.    There is a clear piece of plastic that separates the top cover from the bottom, and a letter from Ridley Scott is printed on it telling you a little bit about what the set contains.    This product deserves 5 stars just for it's production value alone. A lot of thought, consideration, and love went into this limited edition DVD set. THIS is what Blade Runner fans (like me) have been waiting for for a LONG time!    If you are just a casual fan of Blade Runner, or if you've never seen it and would like to, there is a less-expensive version of this release out there that does not have the case or any of the \\"toys\\" or conceptual art. It is just a bare-bones case containing the same 5 discs you get with this limited edition set. There is also a version that has only the \\"Final Cut\\" and the \\"Dangerous Days\\" documentary dics that is even less expensive than that.    Again, there is something for everyone and something within everyone's price range to celebrate the 25th anniversary of such a landmark film.
B00006JMQG|2.0|Five minutes into the Kino restoration of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,\\" I had to stop the movie.  Having spent years with the cheap [[ASIN:B000067IW0 Alpha Video release]], I was amazed to see that the quality of this Kino restoration was actually WORSE than the Alpha video release.  Just to be sure, I put in the Alpha Video release, and then the Kino release again, comparing them shot-by-shot.<br /><br />There is absolutely no doubt that the Alpha Video version is MUCH clearer.  While it lacks the original color tinting that the Kino version offers, there are no blurs, dark spots, or contrast issues when viewing the Alpha version.  The picture is entirely clear.<br /><br />The Kino release seems to sacrifice everything else for the sake of providing a cut that contains the original color tinting, but the picture is far worse.  Additionally, the Kino release contains just as many jumps and scratches as (if not more than) The Alpha Video release.  And, while the Alpha soundtrack doesn't always match the action of the film, the modernized brass ensemble soundtrack on the Kino restoration just feels wholly inappropriate.<br /><br />In short, I see absolutely no reason to spend more for the Kino restoration of this film.  I own both the expensive Kino release and the cheap Alpha Video release, and I'll be watching my Alpha copy from now on.  Besides, Kino just made their \\"[[ASIN:B00006JDSI Restored Authorized Edition]]\\" of Nosferatu obsolete last month by creating an [[ASIN:B000VUQ4HW Ultimate edition]] that is far cleaner and contains the original score.  Considering the popularity of Dr. Caligari, I'm sure an Ultimate edition is on the way for this film, as well.  Don't waste your money on this edition.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I am a Pink Floyd fan but I don't like their older materiel.  For this reason, this double album brings me mixed emotions.  Some great classics are there but the older stuff make shadow on them.  To me, most Pink Floyd albums are masterpieces.  I see almost every album as one masterworks and extracting part of them from where they came from doesn't give a good listening experience.  As another reviewer said (and I agree with him) there is three distinctive period in the band musical evolution.  The first one is the one with Syd Barret and earlier works, I don't like this one, then came Meddle and Roger Waters took the lead of the band.  This period gave us some great masterpieces like Dark side of the moon or Wish you were here.  Finally, Roger left and David took the lead in the band, giving us some good albums but not as great as earlier works.  Mixing all these doesn't provide a good listening experience to me.  When I listen to Dark side of the moon or Animals or any other album of the band, I just can't do anything else that listening from the beginning till the end.. FInally, there are many missing songs like Dogs from Animals or On the turning away from Momentary Lapse of reason.  I would recommand to buy every Pink Floyd album based on your musical preference instead of this Best of.  Pink Floyd is a band that you can't make a best of,,,you just can't cut any part of any masterpieces and Pink Floyd had too many albums that deserve the masterpiece tag.
0525950079|5.0|Other than wanting to know what happens to Merthin, Caris and Gwenda, I found myself really wanting to know and learn more about this period of English history -- daily life, economics, the serfs, trade, law and order, etc. I found lots and lots of connections between our modern world and the Middle Ages. And I could add stupidity and human folly to the list of connections, as well.     Even though the mystery given to us at the outset of World Without End doesn't quite hold the same punch that Pillar's mystery did, I was still very satisfied with the way that the story was wrapped up.     Britain should treasure writers like Ken Follett more than I perceive they do. One critic I read was literally making fun of the way Ken Follett laughed at a particular event for World Without End. I'd like to see that 'critic' put 1,000 pages of words on paper accurately portraying any period of English history and do it interestingly i.e., tell a story that would hold anyone's interest other than his own.
B000WQW988|5.0|Although this took too long to finally come out, it sure makes it worth the wait. On this night Nirvana showed a different side, subtle but no less powerful. Beginning with \\"About A Girl\\" and reaching a zenith with the closer \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", this performance still looks and sounds fresh. All this time later I realize two things, I still miss Kurt Cobain and they don't make \\"Unplugged\\" like they use to.
B000002UB3|5.0|Being the first Beatles album I ever really got into, it's needless to say that this album changed my life and is one of the greatest ever made.

Please get your hands on this album immediately if you have not already.
0446677450|4.0|Kiyosaki illustrates the pointlessness of living in the never ending rat-race of life.  By giving a metaphorical example of the teachings of his \\"rich dad and poor dad\\" He shows a sure way to keep ahead of the rest by using simple financial know-how and terms that even a beginner could understand.  The authors approach to financial topics I had never heard of before was calming and made reading this book an enjoyable experience.  This book is by no means an answer to all money problems, but is a great starting point towards taking control of them.
0894803123|5.0|This dessert book is awesome!  While I recommend not using the egg bases they have because they get icy, the recipes themselves are tasty.  I like that I can try any base I want until I find one I like, then just use one of these yummy recipes with it.  Actually, I got a Cuisinart ice cream maker and the basic vanilla base tastes MUCH better then the egg ones listed in this book.  If you love Ben & Jerry's and you make your own ice cream, this book is a must!

B00067189O|5.0|Kind of Blue is arguably the best jazz album of all time. Some might say that it is the greatest album of all time, period, though I would not go quite that far. Nevertheless, I will prize this release as my very first Dualdisc DVD.    The sound quality in this format is quite superb. Through my DVD player, I played the CD (Side 1) version of Kind of Blue and compared it with the Dualdisc 5.1 (Side 2) version. It turns out that they are both enjoyable; however, the 5.1 does add that nice dimension to Davis' cool, trumpet-blowing jazz.     If you ever take the time to listen, you will be delighted by the advanced resolution in the sound quality and how the instrumentations are simultaneously separated and reverberated throughout the six channels. In terms of awesome sound quality, Kind of Blue never sounded so good. Again, if you prefer the 5.1 mix, you can listen to side 2, or if you are a self-proclaimed purist who prefers not having audio tampered in the least bit, then stay on Side 1.    All in all, think of it as 2 for the price of 1. Regardless of the format, this Miles Davis classic is a must have!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I actually bought this when it was new in the store - it was about $30 or so but it was so worth the money!

It's PERFECT for both movie lovers and Titanic lovers!

1400032717|5.0|While I enjoyed this novel, and think Haddon is a tremendous writer, the story strays past fiction into fantasy or fairy tale in places.  A child with Christopher's condition could not even reasonably accomplish some of the feats in this story.  I understand it is fiction, but would prefer it if there was an appendix with a bit of factual information on Christopher's condition at the end.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|In 1972, Eat a Peach, released after the death of Duane Allman, one of the most outstanding guitarists ever, solidified the foundation of Southern Rock, much of it laid by the late, great musician and his surviving brother, Gregg. A landmark album in its own right, Eat a Peach was perhaps the first new release that combined music recorded in the studio with that which was recorded before a live audience. This was made so due to Duane's untimely fate. In fact, questions had previously arisen as to whether there would even be another Allman Brothers project after the 1971 classic, Live at Fillmore East. Dedicated to the memory of Duane, Eat a Peach was Gregg's answer, blending together tracks recorded before and after the departure of the elder Allman brother. And a triumphant decision it turned out to be.    Contained are the traditional Southern Rock staples Ain't Wastin' No More Time, the eternal Melissa, and the often-played but impossible to overplay Blue Sky. Included is the longest recorded rock track that I know of that was performed continuously (There was splicing and summing of recorded fragments in other albums such as Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick), which was the roughly thirty-three-and-a-half-minute outtake from Live at Fillmore East, Mountain Jam.     Eat a Peach is a most enjoyable, though sometimes poignant, listen. It has, again, the finely-tuned organ and the top-notch guitar work of the great Allman Brothers. You have the signature live and studio pieces that have preserved the Allman Brothers' legacy.    In the Deluxe CD version is included the Allman Brothers' final performance at Fillmore East, recorded just a few days after the aforementioned, breakthrough live album. It is another nice addition to the Southern Rock repertoire. 'Nuff said.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Matt Damon does his usual stellar job as Jason Bourne in this third entry in the trilogy.  In this movie he is tracking down his girlfriend's killer while the CIA is trying to track him down.  There are lots of exciting chase scenes and the action is non-stop.  In the process, Jason learns about his true identity, comes across an old friend, and begins to regain his memory.  This series has provided three entertaining movies and it's too bad that it has to come to an end.

Thanks George and Brad, keep doing what you both are doing.    P.S.  I love and am proud of you both EQUALLY, so do not look whose name I write first.

0385720920|2.0|While the novel has a fine story, and is classic Palahniuk, I can only give the product 2 stars.  The binding is of low quality and falls apart easily.  My copy came completely unbound after being left in my car for less than 3 hours of a warm-ish Pacific Northwest afternoon.  A friend's copy came partially unbound after being left on the floor in his living room five feet from the fireplace.<br /><br />Enjoyable read, but you may want to buy a used hardcover, or borrow it from the library.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|When I first saw this movie I thought it was too mushy and sentimental to be taken seriously.    Now I am living in a shelter for the homeless, have ended a relationship of 10 years, and have the usual Christmastime hypersensitivity and memories of Christmas past that make my heart sore and tender.    This Christmas I really NEEDED \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\"  It nourished me.  Watching Jimmy Stewart--his beautiful, mobile face, his grace, his astounding acting ability, his ability to quintessentially embody what is best about America and make us feel we are all in it together--filled that hollow place.  The wonderful Clarence--his connection to G-d in` a casual and clumsy way, and yet his ability to bring off a glorious miracle: to grant a man an appreciation for being alive.  The miraculous rescue of George through the goodness and kindness of the people who know him.  George's heartfelt prayer on the bridge, when he has hit bottom.      The movie left me feeling connected, understood.    Frank Capra borrwed from Dickens's immortal A CHRISTMAS CAROL--an intervention by spirits into the life of mortal man to instruct and glorify--although, interestingly, Dickens did not venture into the realm of formalized religion.  The joy we share with George Bailey on his glorious return to the land of the living mirrors the unforgettable scene when Ebenezer Scrooge (played by Alistair Sim) realizes he is back in his own room, safe and sound.  That may be one of Frank Capra's themes:     It's a Frank Capra world, as far as I'm concerned.  Yes, I know life isn't really like this, but maybe it could be.    \\". . . and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us!\\"  Charles Dickens  A CHRISTMAS CAROL    P.S. I gave away the colorized disc.  YUK!!!!!!!!

B0002KVULG|5.0|I've been a huge fan of this movie since I first saw it at age twelve.  As far as I'm concerned, this is THE definitive Dracula movie (with Coppola's version running a close second).    Count Dracula comes to England and movies into a run-down castle called Carfax Abbey. He immediately befriends his neighbors, Dr. Jack Seward and his daughter Lucy.  From the gitgo Dracula and Lucy are attracted to each other, and watching this attraction come to fruition will put you at the edge of your seat.  It doesn't get any better than Lucy's dinner date with Dracula, followed by him appearing in her bedroom the next night.    After you watch this movie, you will always see Frank Langella as Dracula.

B000X1Z0BU|4.0|\\"Once\\" is an attempt at a musical for modern audiences, in which the characters express themselves through music but don't burst into song in places where it seems inappropriate. The two main characters are musicians, so it's natural for their feelings to be reflected in the songs they write. A street musician (Glen Hansard) in Dublin, Ireland sings popular covers by day and is trying out his own music on passersby at night when a friendly and somewhat impertinent street vendor (Marketa Irglova) stops to talk. It turns out that she is a classically trained pianist from the Czech Republic. The busker never had much ambition, but he is inspired by a fruitful collaboration with his new friend and finally motivated to record his music.<br /><br />You may recognize Glen Hansard as the frontman for the Irish band The Frames. John Carney, who wrote and directed the film, was formerly a band member. His philosophy in casting was to get \\"really good singers who can half-act\\" instead of settling for actors with mediocre musical talents. Hansard and Irglova are not professional actors, so \\"Once\\" uses a lot of long lenses by necessity. It's shot documentary style with some handheld work, but only occasionally shaky. The awkwardness of the characters' relationship and the man's palpable frustration create a strong sense of realism. Ironically, the only thing that feels self-conscious and inauthentic is that we so rarely hear the characters names spoken. Several of the songs are quite good, and they do, indeed, seem natural in their context.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2007): There are 4 featurettes and an audio commentary. \\"Making a Modern Day Musical\\" (12 min) interviews John Carney about his inspiration and approach, working on a micro budget, non-actors, and Glen Hansard about writing the songs. \\"More Guy, More Girl\\" (9 min) talks to the director and actors about the characters' relationship and audience reaction. \\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Guy\\" (1 min) is a webisode animated with stick figures. \\"Musical Commentary with writer-director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova\\" takes us through the13 songs and fragments with commentary on filming and performing them.

0151013047|5.0|I feel a kinship with this author as I am also a former finance-junkie (Partner in a Private Equity Firm) of South Asian descent before becoming a novelist when I wrote \\"Imposters at the Gate: A Novel about Private Equity\\".  My \\"keyboard brother\\" has done a great job in grappling with issues of cultural identity and pointing out how corporate ideals are incongruent when applied to one's personal life.  We see this when the mantra of the firm that his boss espouses, stick to the \\"fundamentals\\" provides a response in vast contrast to the firm's expectations when Changez applies this to his personal life.  My novel pursues a similar story construct, but is ethically motivated and not politically.  I'm looking forward to his future work.
0316067598|5.0|This is fast paced and gut-wrenching.  From the initial SEAL training through missions themselves, this book is a fast read and a demonstration of what our elite forces go through and are capable of.  What a credit to the United States are men such as Marcus Luttrell and the lost members of Operation Redwing!  In the same vein, this is the perfect book to show the dangers of \\"cut and run\\" political philosophies and liberal media biases.  It costs lives.  I am also proud that this great country (and OK, Texas,too, Marcus) has produced such brave, valiant and liberty loving men.  God Bless and sustain them all. We can never thank them all enough for their service and sacrifice!

B000WZAE1I|4.0|\\"Stardust\\" is an unapologetically fun fantasy adventure based on Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name. In Victorian England, in a village called Wall, curiosity gets the better of a young man who crosses Wall's forbidden threshold to the magical kingdom of Stormhold. Eighteen years later, his son Tristan (Charlie Cox) wants to visit the other side of the Wall also, to retrieve a fallen star that will win the heart and hand of a pretty girl. But the star turns out to be a young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes), and Tristan is not the only one who seeks her. Yvaine's heart holds the power of eternal youth, sought by an ancient witch (Michelle Pfeiffer). And she wears the necklace that will determine the succession to the throne of Stormhold if possessed by one of the kingdom's rival princes.<br /><br />And so we embark on an adventure of sorcery, romance, duels, damsels, and lots of good humor. The ample murders and grotesqueries are presented with aplomb and wit but might be too frightening for the youngest children. The comedy is what stuck with me, though: Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing pirate preoccupied with preserving his ruthless reputation, a chorus of deceased princes keeping a critical eye on their brothers' progress, Claire Danes professing her love to a mouse. There are too many deus ex machina, but I was too entertained to care. \\"Stardust\\" proudly resists analysis and shuns themes beyond the \\"love is grand\\" and \\"sadistic, selfish witches are bad\\" truisms. This film occupies itself entirely with entertainment and succeeds marvelously.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2007): Bonus features include 5 deleted scenes, a Blooper Reel (6 min), a theatrical trailer, and one featurette. \\"Good Omens: The Making of Stardust\\" (30 min) interviews director and co-screenwriter Matthew Vaughn, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, cast and creative crew about sets, visual effects, casting, dueling, and making the film. Author Neil Gaiman also talks about his inspiration for the book and thoughts on the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French.

B000RZIGZ4|4.0|I grew up with Top Gun being one of the best movies so when it came out in HD DVD it was a must buy.  One word of warning is not all the scenes are in HD...    All the productions shots are HD but the canned footage of the carrier at sea are not in HD.  So when you see fighters land and take off and you see real footage from the carrier deck it is in normal definition.  To bad they could not get HD from the military or did not take quality video when it was shot on the carrier.    Other than this it is a good purchase, but still disappointed in the non-HD scenes.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|Another strong season for this series about the trials and tribulations of a close mother and daughter pair (Laurem Graham and Alexis Bledel).  Much of the angst comes with the introduction of a new character, Luke's nephew Jess (Milo Ventimiglia).  He sets his sights on Rory early on, and his bad boy vibe coupled with his appreciation of fine literature catches her attention as well, which does not bode well for her relationship with Dean (Jared Padalecki).  Lorelai's love life remains as complicated as ever, as does her relationships with her parents.  The clever, rapid-fire dialogue and genuinely likable characters make this a show to savor.

B0007VCZ50|5.0|I really love this doc/rockamentary.  It is far better than I expected actually and now one of my favorite Sting videos.  The bringing together of a new band, with interviews with them and him.  It shows them growing together moving towards Sting's first concert after leaving The Police.  The new music is from Dream of Blue Turtles and some older songs reinvented.  The band members come from jazz backgrounds, as does Sting, and I think it gels and rocks!  The music, from my perspective, is what I call fusion - rock, jazz and blues.  I love this movie and the music.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is definitely one of the best series ever made by BBC. I like the segment at the end of each episode detailing how the actual footage was taken. What seems like a short 15 min film may take years to capture. The dedication, passion and professionalism of the BBC crew alone is enough to justify the purchase of this box set. The images are breathtaking and stir the wanderlust in me. Add the impeccable narration of Sir David Attenborough, Planet Earth is simply perfect for me. Highly recommended.
B000005ILF|5.0|I love this CD from Sting.  It has many of the songs I already loved.  Some of these songs have been taken forward by Sting in later concerts, such as Lithium Sunset (in the Brand New Day tour).  Valparaiso was in a movie.  I had become familiar with some of the songs from YouTube - Let Your Soul be Your Pilot and Brought to My Senses.  The Hounds of Winter from the All This Time documentary/performance 9/11.  All the songs have become favorites of mine.  The first song and the last song have the title \\"Mercury Falling\\" in them.  This is one of my favorite Sting CDs.

0141439688|5.0|Jane Austen's shortest and last novel is Persuasion. Austen had only 11 months to live when she completed it in 1816. Austen is the best writer in the language at taking a few upper-middle class rural families, a few love stories and arch social commentary into the heady mix that is her literary genius! Her observations of the social mores and balls, clothing style, music, literature, architecture and daily life of Regency England<br />(1811-1820-the Prince Regent George IV assumed responsibility while his father George III became insane). is superb in its comic prose.<br />  The tale's main theme is how humans are persuaded to perform and also avoid moral actions which will determine how they live their lives. Eight years prior to the novel's opening we learn that Anne Eliot had earlier rejected the proposal of British naval officer Frederick Wentworth. She was persuaded to pursue this action due to the advice of her of a well meaning wealthy woman.<br />  Now Anne's impecunious and fatuously highfaultin baronet of a father has to lease his home due to pay his many debts. Her older sister Elizabeth is a hypocritcal prig who has to be one of the most odious creatures in Austen's work. Captain Wentworth returns to the village of Kellynch since his sister and her husband have rented the Eliot home. (they have departed for the watering hole of Bath). Eventually Anne and her Wentworth met, reconcile and are wed. Along the way we meet such characters as Anne's idiotic sister Mary and her husband who spends most of his time hunting. There are also a few subsidary love stories featuring Anne's siblings and the Musgrave girls. The fall of Lousia Mulgrave off the cob at Lyme is famous at is shows Anne that Wentworth still has feelings of love for her.<br />  The novel is lighter and less complex than such tomes as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Emma.\\" It was published in four volumes along with Jane's early work \\"Northanger Abbey\\" following her early death.<br />One is left to wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen. Her books take us back over 150 years to a relatively stable and staid society. If one would be allowed b by the literary gods to invite three authors to dinner this reviewer would choose: Samuel Johnson, Oscar Wilde and Jane Austen. \\"Persuasion\\"<br />will be broadcast on the BBC production to be shown on Masterpiece Theatre this autumn. Hopefully viewers of the series will turn to the real McCoy and enjoy the many pages of the preacher's kid named Jane!wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen.

B00000K31V|5.0|This is an interesting movie at different levels.  This movie has an ensemble cast - many twists and turns, going into the \\"game world of virtual reality\\".  It has been compared and was released around the same time as Matrix, which also dealt with multiple levels of reality.  From the lower level of reality, it is a story of a group of people testing a new game.  The story moves from one level of reality to another, playing the game, and is based in part on the premise that there are game people who want to live 100% in virtual reality and those people who are angry that some people don't want to live in \\"this\\" world and create a fake or illusory world - contrary to what is best for the culture.<br /><br />The higher level question is what is reality; and what do we create by the use of our minds to \\"create our world.\\"  There is a line in the movie were Jude Law's character Ted is stating that the \\"game\\" world reality they were playing has no rules or structure and everyone is moving about looking for a purpose (or something to that effect).  Jennifer Jason Leigh's character, who is the game's creator Allegra, in the level of the game, says: how is this so different from other realities?<br /><br />This movie and Matrix, in different ways, ask us, the observer, to question reality to see what we create with our Minds and that in turns brings to us that which we \\"see and believe\\" is true.  We create our own reality - all else is illusion.

1878424319|5.0|Having read and adored \\"[[ASIN:1878424424 The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship: A Toltec Wisdom Book]]\\" by Toltec Master, Don Miguel Ruiz, I was very excited to read \\"The Four Agreements.\\"  These four agreements are simple guiding principles that can free us to live with well-being and true happiness.  In order to discover Heaven on earth, the author explains that we need only keep our word with ourselves and live with integrity.  This will support our living in the present moment.  By telling the truth and being with life as it actually unfolds, rather than disagreeing and investing pointlessly in how we would prefer it to be, we can be in harmony with our lives.     What I appreciated most about this book is that its advice is so practical and achievable, even in a challenging environment such as New York City. Another book with practical wisdom that can put you in touch with the magic available in the present moment is \\"[[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]],\\" by Ariel & Shya Kane.  Both Ruiz's and the Kanes' books have touched my life profoundly by supporting me in being the author of my life, and I recommend them wholeheartedly.

1582701709|5.0|So what's this \\"secret\\" about?  If you are a grateful person, you will attract things and situations to be grateful for.  If you are a humanitarian, you will attract endless chances to carry out your mission.  And, if you are a complainer in life, you will attract more and more things to complain about. And you'll attract fellow complainers to tell you you're right!  For all the reviewers who claim that they don't want money at all,  they obviously have enough wealth to buy a computer. Hard to do when you're living in a noble fashion, in a box underneath the freeway.    The Law of Attraction exists. The Bible talks about it all the time. As for our not being \\"worthy\\" enough to co-create with God, the Bible also asks \\"Know ye not that ye are gods?\\"  People with near-death experiences come back to life, enthusiastic about \\"co- creating with God here on Earth\\".    A lot of the Amazon reviewers  are disillusioned that \\"The Secret\\" won't materialize things in their hands instantly.  If that were the case, a giant redwood would grow to full maturity in 5 seconds!  Attraction works within Earth's time/space parameters.  A feel for these things comes with practice.  The \\"Negative-Nancy-Crabby-Appleton-Ebeneezer-Scrooge\\" reviews (\\"The Secret? Bah! Humbug!\\")  are a hoot and a half!  They really go to great lengths to slam this book, and the results are hilarious!  Just think what all that imagination could do if it were channeled into something positive that they really wanted....either for themselves or for others.  Oh, well....
B000VI70WM|5.0|If you are a Duranie, you must be proud of this band; if you are a music fan, you should love it. Where other million-selling artists eternally remake their own music for the masses, Duran Duran always cast their pure spell, and this time, they shake the room in a knockout of music glory. In RED CARPET MASSACRE, Durans follow the guiding light of their grooving spirit and deliver one of their best albums ever, joined in the control room by the Timba-dollar duo and Grammy-Award producers Nate Hills and Jimmy Douglass. Despite the apparently strange pairings, the result is quite fit -clearly impressive, since the album is not just freshly modern, it's plain brilliant, showcasing some groovy club moments like Nite Runner, Skin Divers or Tempted with the depth and sweetness of songs as Falling Down, Box Full O'Honey and She's Too Much. And there is plenty of more classy sparkles, like the pushing pulses of The Valley, the rocky beats of Zoom In and the title-track, along with the new-wave instrumental Tricked Out, the sax magic of Dirty Great Monster and the soft layers of Last Man Standing. The songs are beautiful, and the whole work sounds strong and cohesive, with great Simon Le Bon vocals and lyrics, Nick Rhodes' good-caring hands all around, John Taylor+Roger Taylor's punching rhyhtm structure, all proving to be great musicians while adapting their skills to today's producing techniques, with happy Dom Brown services on guitars. While there even might be critics here and there, you might think they are too well stuck in the eighties or that they did not even really listen to the album, the sunny truth is that this band is not just great and underrated, but authentically alive and definetely kicking on the dancefloor.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|Wow! Just wow!  That's all I can say about this CD.  The term songbird has never fit anyone better than it does Taylor.  Her infectious spirit pours out of every song, making you want to sing every line.  From the catchy & sweet (Stay Beautiful) to a lover done wrong (Picture To Burn, Should`ve Said No), evey line strikes true.  Even the bonus tracks are good.  And if there are two more heartbreaking songs in modern country music today than Cold As You & Tied Together With A Smile, I'd like to know what they are.    Taylor Swift is like a breath of fresh air from the shallow pop star wannabes (Rimes, Underwood).  The sad thing is:  as long as Little Miss American Idol is being coddled by the corrupt music industry, Taylor won't get the complete recognition her talents deserve.  I just hope her label doesn't turn her next CD into another piece of overproduced Nashville crap, trying to knock Carrie off her perch.  What A shame THAT would be.

0743496728|5.0|This is a review on the Audio CD Version of Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult, read by Carol Monda. Have you ever been bullied in school? I have, and I clearly remember every single detail, if you ask me to remember the first day of school or the names of my third grade teachers I would draw a blank, but the bullying has left a permanent mark in my memories. I was in 6th grade, when a boy named Stacey pulled my skirt off in front of the whole cafeteria, he meant to pull it up but he did it so hard it ripped and came right off. I was left standing in my underwear until I ran out. I can also remember being on the school bus in 7th grade and the popular girl behind me, Gina, pulled my hair out constantly, talking loudly to everyone about my \\"lice\\" problem, even though that wasn't the truth. I have been spit on, tripped, my bookbag was stolen and later ended up with about 5 school lunches in it on my doorstep. Did I cry myself to sleep, and wish serious harm on all those people? You betcha, did I do anything about it, No.<br /><br />This is about a Boy named Peter, who did do something about it, and it took him 19 minutes to carry it out. It's also a book about the families of both the shooter and the victims and the ones who survived his rampage. Its not black and white, its not even gray, its colored in crayons, chalk and sharpie pens, and its not inside the lines. I listened to this book with tears in my eyes because I could identify with it, I could see with the same eyes as Peter, but also with the people who bullied by proxy and swallowed the guilt of non action. You can both hate and love your friends, and fear them at the same time. Popularity comes with a price, and it's not always worth it. Jodi Picoult knows her way around a courtroom, and her way around the human spirit. I thought about my bullies after I finished it and I silently forgave them after all this time, because maybe they thought about me later on and hoped that I would forgive them.

And as such it's pretty amazing how much Hercule Poirot is him glorious self already. pompous, witty, abrasive, yet kind and chivalrous especially to a \\"woman's secret heart,\\" for he goes to crazy lengths to  ake things come out all right for two separate couples by the time STYLES is over.<br /><br />I just finished Gilbert Adair's abstruse takeoff on Agatha Christie, MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR OF STYLE, so I decided to go back to the real, original thing, see what I hadn't seen in years.  I was surprised to find that, in the twenty years since I had read the book, very little of it had remained in my memory--outside of the central trick.  In a way, the book is spoiled by an ugly racial remark thatv just seems to slip out of the lips of the one character in the book everyone loves, the faithful white servant \\"Dorcas.\\"  It's not that Christie wants to characterize Dorcas as a prejudiced sort, but just take a look at page 137 and you'll get the shivers.  It's rather odd in Christie, for often enough she lets her characters' racialized remarks tell against them, but here it's just the opposite and you can tell that Dorcas is supposed to be more cute after making it.<br /><br />What's hard to figure out is why, in CURTAIN, Christie decided to return to the scene of her first novel, for it doesn't really have as much weight as some of the country houses she describes elsewhere.  Oh well, it must have been a sentimental mise en scene for her, the site of the meeting of Hastings and Poirot; the place where her first novel located itself, etc.  CURTAIN is a book very few of us have ever been able to plumb to its depths--and I thought a reread of STYLES might help.  No, but it's great fun all on its own, and the plot is so crazily complicated that it takes the final fifty pages to work out all the kinks and false solutions of the story, before Poirot finally shows what his \\"last link\\" has led him to.<br /><br />One more thing that was strange, how there are only 12 chapters in the book, of very uneven lengths--some a few pages only, some upwards of 30.  I don't remember Christie ever returning to this noticeably choppy way of telling a story?t was strange, how there are only 12 chapters in the book, of very uneven lengths--some a few pages only, some upwards of 30.

B000J103PC|5.0|If you've read even one review of this movie, you know there's widespread agreement that Meryl Streep does a fabulous job as the icy cold and understated yet verbally abusive, fashion editor icon, Miranda Priestly.  And I completely agree:  I find myself eagerly awaiting Meryl's every icy barb or condescending look over her reading glasses. I kept thinking how Miranda's behavior was completely opposite from the managerial advice of the \\"One Minute Manager\\", \\"catch someone doing something right.\\"  And so much for communication being a two-way street with Miranda saying her piece and terminating the discussion with \\"that is all.\\"  Anyone who's even taken one business management course will get a kick out of Miranda managing people the opposite of of how it's taught.    But the movie is worth watching for more reasons than Meryl Streep alone.  Beyond Streep, there's the acting of the other characters:  Anne Hathaway's \\"fish out of water\\"/\\"trial by fire\\"/\\"do what you gotta do to succeed\\" metamorphosis.  First assistant Emily Blunt's persona of snooty rudeness to the only person she can boss (Anne Hathaway's character) while being a bundle of nerves around her boss.  And hetereosexual actor, Stanley Tucci's performance of the gay fashion director, Nigel, for which he beat out gay actors for the part.  And yes, these folks' acting holds up quite well, even if Miranda Priestly had been played by Helen Mirren or another actress.    Second, this is a movie that made me think.  It can trigger many discussions about:  * Life's tradeoffs one often does to succeed in one's career.  * Is one's career ladder against the wrong wall?  * How the rich and powerful can get away with bullying their assistants merely because they're rich and powerful.    * How would having a boss like Miranda really play out in real life?  Could she have really gotten as far as she has by being so verbally abusive and uncomplimentary to her staff?    * Why there are so many eating disorders in the fashion industry.  In the world of Runway Magazine, size 6 is considered fat, and a reduction to size 4 is to be celebrated.    I highly recommend watching for (1) Meryl Streep, (2) Excellent performances by the other main actors, and (3) The fact that the movie is so thought-provoking.  Worth watching with a friend and discussing it afterwards.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This is a brilliant film. The plot is twisting but reasoned. Denzel Washington and Christopher Plummer are superb. Even the sound track is gripping. I am not a big fan of Spike Lee films, but this one blew me away.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Awesome adaptation of the musical by Stephen Sondheim...directed by none other than Tim Burton and starring an amazing Johnny Depp in the title role. Everything about this film is perfect!     Depp plays a man formerly named Benjamin Barker, who comes back to his hometown after 15 years after being banished by Judge Turpin, who rapes his wife and kidnaps his daughter in his absence. Benjamin returns later on, hears about his wife and daughter's fate, and vows to take revenge...even if it means killing off the entire town. So, he opens up a little barber shop, changes his name to Sweeney Todd, and teams up with a cook named Mrs. Lovett, and well, you're in for a big treat. It's extremely dark and sick, but you'll be singing along all the way to the end!     If this doesn't win any Oscars, I'll be pissed. SEE IT NOW!

1400063515|5.0|I first saw Mr. Taleb at PopTech, a conference of big thinkers that I went to yearly in first half of this decade, the people that spoke there were all smart, leaders in their fields. Taleb's story was different, he was debunking the core beliefs in the area of investment banking.<br /><br />Simply put, he is the best thinker in the area of Karl Popper's teachings that I've ever met, George Soros is a more well known proponent of Dr. Popper's teaching but I've never been fortunate enough to meet him.<br /><br />Black Swan will help anyone that has to make critical decisions concerning investments, and if you think the ideas through maybe other areas of life, better and without emotion. Emotion is the fog of the investment world and Taleb is blowing his foghorn for all to hear, if you invest, read this book.
014305841X|5.0|I bought it on a whim, and after I started reading, I bought more copies for my friends and children. This book teaches so much that I never knew, provokes so many thoughts that I hadn't considered, and makes me pay far more attention to what I eat and serve than any book I can remember.  The topic is FOOD...what it is, how it has changed, where it comes from, when we got off the path, and why business is linked more seriously than I dreamed, all relative to my choices of: What To Eat?  What IS food?  How to sort it all out...?  It's biology, philosophy, nutrition, and politics.  It's an epiphany.  It's very well researched and very well done. Pollan has written an important book and I'm fortunate that I read it. CS
B000VLE3IS|5.0|Led Zeppelin STILL kicks arse!!!!    Yes, I know all these songs are on other albums that we have ALL played 1000's of times, if not more. But come on...we still bought this CD/DVD because we love the band and they speak to us all at some level-in life.    I personally never had a copy of Physical Graffiti, but have always loved the songs Kashmir and In My Time of Dying. Now I have them!! I also appreciate that the songs are not in the original order that they were on the original albums...shakes things up and keeps it very fresh like having a built in shuffle for your Led Zeppelin songs.    This is a great intro to the band for folks that are just starting out (although I don't see how that is possible because hasn't everyone heard of them by now?? Even my own children have been listening to them since before they were even born!!).     I should say this CD/DVD makes me feel 15 all over again...X-Mas Day 1976  my parents dropped me and my 13 y.o. sister off at the theater to see TSRTS. Remember no cell phones back then...pay phones that cost a dime...We saw the movie the first time, ran out to the lobby and called home \\"please let us see this again\\", they did. We saw the movie the second time, ran out to the lobby and called home again \\"please let us see the movie a third time\\", they did.     I know we would've asked for a fourth time but that was the last showing of the day!!!! I never got to see them live, just too young to have had the chance.    Everyone flic your Bic and say Amen!!!!
0743496728|5.0|I found this book almost impossible to put down.  There are a lot of similarities between Peter, who was the main character and got picked on all through school, and myself who was picked on throughout my school years except I didn't shoot anybody like he did.  He went on a shooting spree at his high school.  I found all the characters to be very real and true to life.  It had a good ending.  I highly recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />Gerard Zemek<br />husband of author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\"

B000YABV90|5.0|Ok, so the viewer obviously had to suspend belief while watching this movie, as the plot is a bit far fetched. I must admit, the first time I saw the movie, I walked away from the theatre unsure of how I felt, feelings of wonder and sarcasm battling one another, much like the dueling guitars in the park.  However, upon seeing it a second time, I was completely sold. I loved this movie and immediately went home and ordered the soundtrack.  I wish Hollywood made more movies like this.   Some may view the work as sappy and totally unbelievable. But the movie does accomplish it's goal of communicating with the audience through the music. Moreover, it assures people of their purpose and direction in the world, and sends a clear message to be brave enough to belive in something, to be brave enough to want more in the world.   It was a feel good movie with a message of hope and promise and faith. For two hours I forgot how defeated and weery the world had made me feel. Everyone should see this film. For those who can't suspend belief, enjoy the film for what it is rather than criticizing it for what it is not, they are missing out on more in life than just a great movie.
4789004546|5.0|I've used a number of books to learn Japanese over the years, and this was not the first or the last, but I immediately recognized it as the most important as a learning tool and as a reference for beginners.  It gives the reader a clear and concise tour through the fundamentals.  It doesn't teach you \\"street\\" Japanese, but that's better learned on the street - not from a book.  It would be best coupled with spoken Japanese lessons from a native speaker or Pimsleur audio (get the CD and make MP3s).  Also, you don't need to learn how to read/write Japanese kana or kanji to use this book.    What it won't give you is a gentle cumulative approach to vocabulary, instead it just tosses you in the deep end.  If you are serious about learning a language, that's OK - you plan to eventually learn all of the words anyway, so what matter the order in which you learn them?  It's also NOT a good book for the tourist who wants a crash introductory course.    The best part?  You get through this and then you can buy the Intermediate edition and continue toward fluency.  Learn one word a day and you'll be fluent before you know it!
B000TLTUL0|1.0|One word:  \\"TERRIBLE\\"  Very weak voices and basically just a terrible job by everyone involved.  I feel sorry for those who never seen this on Broadway with Angela.  If you did you will know exactly what i mean.  Now she is an actress.  Where do they find these Hollywood people?  The more movies i see the more i think movies will come to an end soon.  There is simply no talent in Hollywood anymore.  Usually when a Broadway musical is made into a movie like Sound of Music, they try to do it even better than the Broadway version.  I think those days are over.  Don't bother with this piece of trash.  Rent the DVD instead.  It's funnier, not as crowed with dialog, better music orchestration and better all around.  I was very disappointed in this one.
B00007L4OM|5.0|An exhilarating ride that's just as hot as the title implies. It's a family film, a buddy comedy, an action flick, but moist of all it's a French movie. Don't be surprised then that the cinematography is great, the movie is made up of gorgeous color hues. And most of the shots are beautiful. Yet, typical of a French film, this movie doesn't try to be artistic; it doesn't try to be something it's not and in that it excels.
6304602944|5.0|If you ask me, Tango & Cash is one of the best and most enjoyable action movies there is.  It may be a big budget Hollywood production, but it's a B flick all the way.  There's nothing very original or unique about the plot(two rival cops have to work together to bring down the crime boss that framed them), and it's full of every bad action cliche to date, but that's all part of the fun.  The movie is packed with cornball manliness and macheezmo, almost to the point of parody.  But what really makes it work is the two leads.  Both Stallone and Russell are two of the best action stars of all time, and I can't think of any other two that could have done this better.  No, it's not Oscar worthy acting, but these two have a fantastic onscreen chemistry.  Neither one is trying to push the other out of the spotlight or out-tough the other.  Their tough guy one liners and banter is so funny, even when the jokes are total groaners.  You can tell they really enjoyed working together, and it makes me wonder why these guys never starred in another film together.  Special mention must also be made to the supporting cast which is a B action/horror movie lover's dream.  You got Michael J. Pollard as a goofy inventor in the mold of James Bond's \\"Q\\", Brion James as an evil henchman, Clint Howard as Stallone's crazy cellmate who plays with a Slinky, James Hong(Lo Pan from Big Trouble in Little China) as one of the crime bosses, Geoffrey Lewis(Orville from Every Which Way But Loose among countless others) as Stallone's captain, and Robert Z'Dar(the Maniac Cop!) as a vicious inmate with a grudge against Stallone.  Plus an early role for Teri Hatcher as Stallone's sister.  Not to mention that the villain is played by the coolest man to ever slap on aftershave, Jack Palance.  Now, even if the movie was pure sludge, how can you go wrong not only with two top notch stars, but also a supporting cast like that?  You can't, that's how!!  I have a special place in my heart for action films of the 80s, and an even more secluded and special spot for this one in particular.  This kind of macho, no brainer action film is not everyone's bag, baby.  But if it does happens to be your bag and you've somehow missed this movie, slap yourself a few times for being a schmuck and see it, pronto!!the 80s, and an even more secluded and special spot for this one in particular.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|If you're used to buying $10 earbuds, these  might seem exorbitantly priced.  However, if you appreciate quality sound, you won't be disappointed.  They sound great and are very sturdy.  Much more durable than the Bose headphones in the same range.<br /><br />The spiral cord and screw-in 1/4 adapter are a nice plus.<br /><br />I use them for mixing audio and video and have been very happy with the results.  They are also pretty comfortable to wear.  A big issue for long sessions.
B0000029DD|5.0|jeff buckleys music is truly wonderful. my only dissopointment with the cd is that the record company, columbia, felt that there name on the actual cd should be larger then jeff buckleys. however the music was made by a true artist and is full of emotion, somthing that is rare in todays music.
0060531053|5.0|this book when combined with How to Brew is just about the best and most comforting thing you could imagine when starting out.

B000VNMMQQ|2.0|I believe they have run out of material.  The story line and scenes were not believable.  I have enjoyed the previous Diehard movies and have copies of them.  But this one I have no desire to keep.  Although there is a lot of action, it did not live up to expectations.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Wonderful story about 1800s England and fight for abolition of slavery.  We see perception of slavery and slave trade from the upper class England nobles point of view.  Young man, Wilberforce, sensitive and caring by nature is compelled to make it his life mission to fight peacefully for the abolition of slavery in colonial England.  At the time when England is the most powerful country in the world and has many colonies, when interests of the rich and powerful are so carefully protected and Jacobian revolution in France is gaining is revolutionary force, young Wilberforce is threading carefully in his efforts to preserve human diginity for African slaves without looking like a revolutionary seeking to overthrow royal traditions of England.  It is powerful movie, full of wisdom and quiet sensitivity.  It is also amazing to learn how power has no mercy towards individuals who are carrying it out.  With increased responsibilites and genuine concern, come illness and weakening of the body.  We see England's Prime Minister William Pitt, age and die prematurely once burdens of the political life take over his physical strength.  This is important film about important moment in England's history that affected the rest of the world in the most profound way, without any use of force or military power.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" as amazing movie.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|We had already seen the movie and loved it. My husband is a Bruce Willis fan, so I ordered it for his Christmas present. I am just glad that I did not pay for shipping, too. Then the cost would have been way above Wal-Mart.

B000U7169M|4.0|Sure, the end-of-days storyline is nothing brand new, but I found The Reaping to be a unique, well-written and suspenseful story.  This movie takes an educated look at religious parables and possible scientific causes, which I find fascinating.  Most of all, however, this movie tells a timely metaphor about the struggle between the pure will of God versus the misguided, fanatical will of man.  The world itself struggles to embrace the concept of a higher power *in addition to* science, without destroying each other in the name of any popular, polarizing religion.<br /><br />I've seen many horror and sci-fi films, and didn't find this one to be annoying or cheesy at all, as other reviews suggested.  I thought all of the characters were believable and I really enjoyed the entire movie.  The \\"Special Features\\" section of the DVD includes a documentary on possible scientific explanations of the biblical plagues, which was also well produced and thought-provoking.
B000WCBMA8|5.0|to keep things simple, this is their best album yet and for all the same reasons you loved their previous ones. the singles you've heard so far are a good indication of what you'll find, but weak track are far and few between. a vicious rock album crammed full of extremely accessible pop melodies. a must buy.
1592402038|4.0|I was very curious about this book; it is a best-selling novel that is primarily about punctuation, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />The layout to the book is fairly simple and the style is replicated for each chapter. In each chapter Truss tells some funny anecdotes about the punctuation being discussed; she give some examples of how misusing the punctuation can change the meaning of the whole sentence. She then discusses the proper use of the punctuation and follows that with a history of how the punctuation got to be where it is today. Full chapters are given to the discussion of the comma and the apostrophe. Colons, semi-colons, braces, etc. are combined in the two final chapters.<br /><br />Now you are asking, \\"How can this book be interesting?\\" If you have ever wondered if you are doing your punctuation properly, it will be interesting. If you have ever wondered where the strange punctuations we use come from, it will be interesting to you. If you have never wondered any of the above, then the examples of punctuation missteps given will probably have you chuckling anyway.<br /><br />There were a lot of things I liked about this book and some I disliked. I will give a list of each below.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- I liked the humor in the book.<br />- Descriptions of how to use the punctuation were easy to understand.<br />- The brief histories' of the punctuations were also interesting.<br />- Truss does a good job of comparing American and English punctuation; so even though Truss in an English author, us Americans don't feel left out.<br />- The book was nicely organized and well-written (although this should be a given considering the topic).<br />- This book really drives home the point of how subjective punctuation is and how flexible and variable the rules of punctuation are.<br />- It really made me start to pay more attention to my usage of punctuation.<br />- The anecdotal stories about punctuation usage provide great examples and are interesting.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- In some cases it makes the proper use of punctuation more muddy than ever. It drives home the fact that the more you learn about a thing, the more you realize you don't (and never will) fully understand it.<br />- There is a lot of self-gratifying (for the author) ranting about the misusage of punctuation. This could be good or bad depending on if you relate to the author's rants or not.<br />- An English author wrote this book; there are many references in English language that might be confusing to an American reader. Many of the punctuations have different names in British English than in American English - the author does make an attempt to address this.<br />- The topic of \\"where will books be in the future\\" is briefly visited in the last chapter. This is such a large and controversial topic that I think it might have been better to not bring it up at all than to mention it, but then say that it's not going to be discussed.<br />- This book also makes me think way too much about my punctuation now; I suppose that could be a good thing.<br /><br />Overall this was a good book to read. It is not that difficult to read and is a great layman's book on punctuation. It provides great insight into the controversial world of punctuation debate and usage. If you have ever been in doubt over whether or not you have a semi-colon addiction; this is the book for you!<br /><br />[...]more muddy than ever.

B000VBP382|5.0|very pleased with this video;  I had seen the movie and I'm pleased to be able to see it at home
B0000844M8|4.0|I was trying to remember just why I never saw this film when it first came out--or subsequently when it might have been shown on TV--when it occurred to me that it was released in 1966 when I was 13, just at the age when I was suddenly less interested in \\"kids' stuff\\" like BORN FREE and increasingly interested in HELP or A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  But deep down, I had always liked animal flicks, and maybe even then--at least in the back of my mind--figured I'd catch up with this tale of a tame lionness, whose \\"human companions\\" attempt to re-train in the ways of the wild.    Viewing the film as an adult, I can see that I probably would have liked it well enough as a youngster, and can agree with the majority of reviewers below, that it is a solid, engaging \\"family film,\\" and a pleasant alternative to much of the brash, jaded and bankrupt fare offered to kids nowadays.  It seems pretty wholesome  by comparison.      Like many family films of the era, however, it was also relatively low budget and not all that \\"well made\\" a product.  The story is a bit on the sketchy side, and you can see the filmmakers making a very deliberate effort to compress the contents of Joy Adamson's book into a 90 minute film.  One example that comes to mind are the references to Joy's husband's near-fatal battle with malaria.  His initial bout is never shown, only referred to in a voice over by actress Virginia McKenna, who plays Joy.  Well, fair enough, I figured, it's not that essential to the story of Elsa, the lionness, and it might be disturbing to younger viewers, so leave it out.  But then, a later relapse is portrayed in pretty graphic detail.  It seems to come almost out of the blue, and will likely confuse younger viewers who may not have seen it coming from the brief mention in the voiceover narration.    Films aimed at children, and their families, often seem to cut corners this way.  In the case of a film based on real life, as this one is, there is also the question of just how muchdramatic license to take.  I never read Adamson's book on which the film is based, but it seems like the movie version must have hewed fairly closely to the text.  There are scenes such as the \\"roving lion in the night\\" sequence that promise some drama--and some danger--only to pretty much peter out in the end.    If that's the case, the filmmakers are actually to be commended for not taking too many liberties with the text.  But better direction, overall pacing and editing can help spice up scenes like these, ones where the action is muted, because in real life, the danger really did pass, or was not as great as it seemed to begin with.    None of this is meant to suggest that the film is not worth seeing.  They really DON'T make 'em like this any more.  Nowadays, Elsa would have had to engage in a battle royal with the roving lion that prowls around the camp at night, and the computer graphics would be dazzling but ultimately misleading.  Parents and children alike will appreciate this film's slower pace, its implicit message on the reverence and preservation of the natural world (an even more vital question today than it was then).  In an era when the need to protect and preserve wildlife and its habitat is even clearer than it was 40 years ago, BORN FREE serves as a reminder that there is much work to be done--but that it's well worth the effort.
075640407X|5.0|Sure, you could just say it is the classic tale of an orphan boy who starts to grow up and finds that he possesses magical powers (sounds familiar, no?). But this book is so much more than that! Rothfuss is an excellent writer and this book is a joy to read. Don't worry that it is too long, it won't feel long enough when you're finishing it up and wishing for more.

B000MV9026|1.0|I watched some of this in the theaters when it came out. I was lucky i didn't have to pay for it since i worked there. Recently my mother gave this to my son for Christmas because she couldn't get rid of it. No one would take this movie from her for, even though she was trying to give it away for free.   So i sat with my son a few days ago watched the rest of it. My first impressions of the beginning of the movie were good, but not excellent. Well it went down hill from there. The characters kept talking about aliens taking fish...who could these aliens be? Of course the aliens are humans. So these 'evil' humans are taking these fish. Since we are taking the fish that they eat these animals are starving. When the movie gets to the end and they are dancing and singing, the camera pans out to get these wide shots of the dancing, but there doesn't seem to be a shortage of them. This is ok because by the time the movie ends some how real humans (not CGI) dance with the penguins and make things all better. Yes, that is right a dance solve the problem (sorry i ruined this crappy movie for you save your time).   My other problem with this movie is the singing. Have you ever watched a National Geographic special on emperor penguins. Well let me tell you they can't sing, they can't dance. Yes, I do understand that it's \\"cute\\" to watch these animals do this, but the over all story destroys this element that could have been fun. The main character of this movie is only able to dance, and because he can't sing he can't find a mate. That is a good story within it's self, but it falls flat on it's face.   Let's review the acting now. I love Nicole Kidman is a fantastic actress, but for some reason her voice through the whole move sounds like she is in a dream-like state.  Elijah Woods is interesting I thought he would end up in the Crack Of Doom at any minute. Robin Williams is the same as he was in Aladdin and every other movie he has been in: Loud, annoying, stupid, and the same yesterday, today and forever...he never changes his style (this includes all comedy's not dramas).   Waste your time go ahead, but I warned you. I would rather watch The Little Mermaid II than have to watch this piece of crap ever again. If I could have given this movie zero stars i would have. IT WAS THAT BAD. Don't forget we are all bad people and we destroy wildlife all the time. We live in America an we are the great evil of the world.   Hollywood thank you once again for making us look like bad people in a stupid movie.

As far as we have gone over the years improving sound quality from early muddy and murky sounding recordings to complete clarity, we've forgotten one thing. Ears don't lie. This set proves what Bob Ludwig and other the other greats of mastering have been telling us for years. Were in a loudness war, and now the music is suffering.

The basics of this theory (read reality) are that every single CD released by most major music corporations want their releases to sound bigger, and better than anything else on the radio. So, to do this mastering engineers over compress the mix, add distortion, anything they can do to make their clients (i.e. Major Labels) music stand out amongst the rest of the crap out there. Now you take this recording and play it on the radio so it can be over compressed again and there's nothing left at all for dynamic range. I listened to the first cut off this disc, and there it was. Over compressed, lifeless, and distorted Led Zeppelin music that I have loved for as long as I can remember, massacred for the next generation.     If they are going to continue with the loudness wars, how about making two different sets of masters. One for the Ipod set who could care less about sound quality, but are only concerned with filling up the 80Gb HD on them so they can listen to this stuff 24/7. And one for the music loving people who want to hear what the music is SUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE.     A great example of why I don't bother wasting my time with music that has been released (with exceptions mind you) over the last 10 years. Agreed, if you want these classic tracks, buy the 80's versions of them and don't waste your time and money on this set.      The bottom line is if you want it to sound louder, just use your hand and turn up the volume knob. Quit making the rest of us suffer through this stuff.

0525457585|5.0|I have read this book now numerous times ever since I was a kid and it still amazes me!   As a child I just loved the story but as a grown-up I found so much depth and wisdom in it, each time I read it a different part of the story seems to unveil a deeper meaning to me.   In fact I think this book was written at least as much for adults as it was for children if not more so.   It talks about life, how we create our destinies searching for what we really want, how we grow in the process or get lost.   Bastian is not a hero, he is simply a little boy, heroic and cowardly alike; human in other words. His story is our collective story about growing up and going through life until the end.   Michael Ende is an amazing author, the details he describes and the ocean of wonderful pictures in this book make it truly a journey to a different world.   I also loved the little details of the book, that every chapter starts with a another letter of the alphabet from A to Z, that it is printed in red and green and the beautiful illustrations by Roswitha Quadflieg.   I wish they had an english edition that looks exactly like the original german one which was made to look exactly as mentioned in the book itself.   This is also a perfect book for reading out loud, it was read to me when I was a kid and I have read it to others since.   If you buy this book make sure to buy an edition printed in red and green. You'll see why...
0743298039|1.0|Alright, so I'm trying my best to finish this book. I have about 75 pages left and it's so boring I just want to give up! I've read 100 pages and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!!! When I'm into a book this far, I usually always try and at least finish it but this is torture. I keep thinking something is going to happen, but it just doesn't.   UGH!!!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Geez, these people here should just go spill on the Lost web sites and save Amazon a trillion bytes of storage. Look, the show is great - if you're even looking here obviously you like the show. Season 3 was excellent, if not the best yet - ignore the babble from the fanatics. Looking for a gift for someone that has seasons 1 & 2? They'll love it. The package is great. It's been mentioned some were missing the booklets, but mine was complete. No disc defects. Excellent quality. There ya go.
B000YENUI6|3.0|I will not go into the content of the film itself since that has been covered in many many reviews.  suffice to say it is a typical cronenberg film in that it rewards repeat viewings because of it's complex subtleties both in plot and character, which are easy to miss the first time around.      It also looks superbly dark, rich, and textured.....and yet also austere and elegant....which seems to always be the case when cronenberg is directing and suschitzky is shooting.  great work all around.    the issue here is the DVD....which is really bare bones.      I suspect that the company was let down by the box office receipts and wanted to rush this DVD out ASAP to quickly grab whatever profits they could....this is the only explanation i can think for such a feature light release.    there are two short and somewhat interesting featurettes totally about 14 minutes.  that is all.  in fact \\"featurette\\" may even be too grand a term since it usually implies a running length of at least 20 minutes.    the menus also look cheap and slapped together.  they must have really been in a hurry.  the film itself only just came out the last week of September and here is the DVD in my mailbox on December 21st. talk about quick turnaround.    By far the most glaring absence is that of a director's commentary.    david cronenberg is one of the most articulate director's of all time....and his commentaries and always interesting.....which makes the lack of one here particularly disappointing.    hopefully they will get it together to put out a more serious release of this great film.    they should do the same with cronenberg's films \\"crash\\"(no commentary or features) and \\"m. butterfly\\"(no DVD release at all).

B000GRUS22|5.0|After reading through other's reviews, it seems that people who are used to Enigma from the previous albums are those that are most disappointed with this album.  I own all the previous Enigma albums, and this one is a bit of a departure from them.  Yet, I still think it retains the essence of Enigma.  If you like \\"From East to West,\\" \\"Smell of Desire,\\" \\"Endless Quest.\\"  You'll probably like this album.  It has more emphasis on instrumental, and less on vocals.  My particular taste in music is for trance and electronica.  Groups like Juno Reactor, Fluke, and Orbital also appeal to me.  This album seems to lean more towards that style as a couple of the tracks almost seem trance-like.  Also, those groups have tracks that dip into the 'Enigma' style as well.  If you like good electronica as a whole, you might be interested in this album.  Enigma's track from this album, \\"Hello and Welcome\\" is quite reminiscent of \\"Bermuda\\" by Fluke.

B000UR9T8W|5.0|I was nervous about ordering the Spiderman Trilogy on line; afraid I would get only one or two of the three and the rest would be special effects or behind the scenes.

B000IJ79WU|1.0|this product is poorly package when I received it the disc was shaking back and forth. Had to ask for a refund
B000W02TDO|5.0|I'll start out that I own all 3 editions of The Black Parade; the standard store issue CD, the deluxe CD velvet box with booklet, and now the deluxe 2-LP edition.  I would say that this is unquestionably the ultimate edition of The Black Parade.  Starting out, if you own one of these albums, you are only 1 of 3000 individuals on the planet who have it.  It's instantly collectible by that virtue alone.  Please note that the editions are not numbered.  The 180-gram heavy duty vinyl is, in a word, luxurious.  When you listen to the album on a decent  turntable, the rich sound produced is much crisper and organic than what CD listeners will hear.  Simply look up any article that puts the virtues of vinyl against CD and you'll see more reasons why the listening experience of The Black Parade is taken to a new level.      The packaging is exquisite.  The heavy grade cardboard slipbox in which both albums and 15-page booklets fit in is built to last.  The layout of the booklets is logical and easy to follow.      The only downside, if there is one, is that the 2 15-page booklets are a reprint of the 70-page book that comes with the deluxe velvet CD edition.  I was hoping to possibly read something new from the bandmembers such as insights into the whole Black Parade experience since the album was released last year, what it's been like touring for it, possibly something from Sam Bayer about the terrific videos he directed that introduced the world to MCR's alter ego.  (for the record, I am hoping that we'll see a concert DVD at some point in the next year with all the music videos included as extras)      At the end of the day, this is the ultimate edition of The Black Parade, bar none.  It is a must for those such as myself who have been fascinated and entranced by one of the greastest albums that the 21st Century has seen to date.    We'll carry on...

0553802534|2.0|I am a Lisa Gardner fan.  Her stories are usually breath-stealing, on the edge of your seat suspenseful.  Alone starts out great, but just never develops into a good solid performance.<br /><br />Rose Gagnon and her son are being held at gun point by Rose's husband, Jimmy.  The police have been called and the STOP (special tactics and operations) team are assembled to bring an end to this \\"supposed\\" hostage situation.  Bobby Dodge, a member of the STOP team has Jimmy in his crosshairs and as Jimmy's finger starts to pull the trigger of the gun he is pointing at his wife, Bobby does what he has been trained to do.... he takes Jimmy out.  Jimmy happens to be the son of a powerful judge who claims that Rose set up the whole scenerio just to get Jimmy killed.  Bobby finds himself caught in the middle as Rose and Judge Gagnon fight it out.  Also caught in the middle, is Rose's young son, who is in and out of the hospital with constant illnesses that Judge Gagnon and his wife claim are just a simple case of Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome.  Is there more than meets the eye in this case?  Did Rose use the police to kill her husband.  Is she trying to kill her son as well?<br /><br />This book started out with a bang, like all the other Gardner novels I have read.  It was exciting and fast paced.  About half way through the story, however, it took a ridicuous turn. It became apparent that Ms. Gardner was trying really hard to build up the suspense and wanted to throw the reader off by adding alot of junk to the story to keep you running in several directions at once.  It simply didn't work this time.  The mystery and suspense and constant adding another layer to be stripped off by the reader exhausted me and took away from the story.  There was just too much going on to be remotely believable and after a few chapters of being introduced to new information, i just became too tired to care.<br /><br />This is definitely not one of Lisa Gardners' best efforts.  I would not recommend it.  There too many \\"good\\" books out there to waste your time on this one.\\"good\\" books out there to waste your time on this one.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Fail-safe happens to be one of the few books I've read. A great book and a fine theatrical adaptation. I feel that Larry Hagman and Henry Fonda gave some of the best performances of their carrers. Very true to the book, in my opinion. I would watch it, commercials and all, each time it would come on broadcast TV and finally checked to see if it was on DVD. An exciting cold war thriller. I highly recommend this DVD.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This has been one of my favorites from the first time I watched it. It's not your typical creepy, trippy Tim Burton movie. It's carnival-esque, colorful, funny, and well-written. It follows a son as he's trying to confirm the veracity of his father's tall tales throughout the years. It moves quickly and keeps you entertained from start to finish. I'm not a crier, but this movie always has me in tears. This was one of my Christmas presents to myself, and it's definitely one I won't regret!
B00000JGHS|5.0|PT Barnum said it best, well... you know what he said, and this movie says it from start to finish; proof? -you watched it! -not because you wanted to fulfill your hungry, starving intellect ( save the denial speech ) but to satisfy your lustful libido. -there, I said it; you just wanted to see Demi's new boobs!  Once all you 'high-and-mightys' out there get past that BS facade you've dragged throughout the reviews, you can get honest for a change and admit you got your moneys worth in eye-candy... and she was well worth whatever time and money was spent!   If seeing Demi as beautifully displayed as you heard she'd be, then I highly recommend buying and watching this movie.  Lets face it; Howard Hughes didn't profit in mad money selling the sensational hit THE OUTLAW to the public because it was a standard production of a  western, but because of the advertised [[ASIN:B000299TII The Outlaw]]specially made bra to be worn and displayed by Jane Russell!
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is my 8 year old son's favorite movie and has inspired him to watch and buy many old classics. If only more kids were given access to really good movies then maybe the tide of mindless crap that flows into our theatres and homes would be stemmed and kids demanded better story lines cleaner plots and better acting...I pray that he goes on to love the old movies and works to restore tham...and keep them alive..

B000VWYNNW|5.0|After becoming intimate with this soundtrack for 30 years, this new one takes some getting used to. It should be re-stickered to read, remixed, remastered and RE-EDITED. Jimmy Page has been hacking at it to swap in and out whatever parts he liked. Drum parts, guitar parts and vocal parts all swapped in and out, here, there and everywhere. I will have to wait for thegardentapes guys analysis of this so I know which parts were taken from which nights during the 3 night MSG stand and which ones are overdubs, etc. Don't get me wrong, it still sounds killer and much better than before and the bonus material was long awaited. Overall, awesome, been playing the hell out of it, NO QUARTER, awesome. SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU, awesome. ROCK N ROLL is from the film version. There is no Santa Claus and there is no such thing as a true LIVE recording either I guess.

B000W4HJ44|4.0|Baltimore will never be the same since the multi-generational hit \\"Hairspray\\" went musical. The original 1988 film was cutting edge for its time. The wonderful characters from that piece are lovingly preserved in the musical version. John Waters fine mix of satire and shock value are still present and are enhanced by a sometimes more serious look at the dynamic times in which the production is placed. Musically, the numbers are all hits. The dancing is, well, Divine. Casting is spot on and sensitive. Travolta as you have never seen him. Whether you are 16 or 60 this film will please. The extras in the 2 disc edition will make this an even more enjoyable addition to your collection.

It is very sad!<br />I'm so discusted with the way our government treats their own people.  After viewing Sicko, I am somewhat ashamed to say I am an american!  THOSE WHO MANDATE SUCH LAWS AND POLICIES WILL SOME DAY HAVE TO MEET THEIR MAKER... THEN THEY WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GET HONEST!  MAYBE THEY WILL REGRET THE DESICIONS THEY MADE... AT THAT TIME IT WILL BE TOO LATE TO CHANGE AND DO THE RIGHT THING!<br />WRITE TO YOUR LEGISLATORS... WE THE PEOPLE DESERVE SO MUCH BETTER!
B00000J2SQ|5.0|Recent Joe Lynn Turner Project \\"SUNSTORM\\" led me to this 1982 Rainbow album in which Joe Lynn Turner showcases his brilliant soulful vocal.<br /><br />DEATHALLEY DRIVER drives this commercial release quite deftly. STONE COLD is no doubt signature Rainbow song to date and it's unfortunate it is their biggest and only US top 40 hit so far. TIGHT SQUEEZE is another beautifully crafted tight straight rock song. POWER and ROCK FEVER show their pop rock appeal which should have been quite large hits. EYES OF FIRE just like LED ZEP classic KASHMIR has the mid-east tone and this song alone is the reason why 70s and 80s rock fans must get this.<br /><br />Verdict: Commercial yet Beautiful release.<br />Rating: 93 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Wide range of 70s and 80s rock fans and must-buy for Joe Lynn Turner fans.
0525950079|5.0|I read Pillars of the Earth a few years ago, and saw that Mr.Follett was putting together this sequel. My wife surprised me with it around Thanksgiving and I immediately delved into it. I remember thinking that I couldn't remember much about \\"Pillars\\", so I was unsure I could tie the two together. Not to worry; this book is completely stand alone, with only a few references to the characters of \\"Pillars\\" (and if you didn't read it, it wouldn't even slow you down).     Each book has it's own flavor. That being said, this book does indeed have the flavor of \\"pillars\\". I had forgotten the flavor of \\"Pillars\\" as it had been a few years, but in reading this new Novel, it all came back to me like seeing an old friend after a lengthy absence.    Mr Follet has never disappointed me yet, and I believe I've read everything he's got in print. He is just simply my favorite author, and it was a pleasure to read his latest offering. 5 stars.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|\\"Amazing Grace\\" has quickly taken it's place on my list of All-Time Favorite Movies. It's an incredible story of one man's sense of mission and perseverance. The story of Wallace Wilberforce is truly inspiring. Plus the movie gives you a palatable sense of that period of history, and is a visual pleasure. Add to that a smattering of romance (deftly inserted without detracting from the main storyline) and occasional humor. Not to mention you can get through the whole film is little (if any?) bad language, violence, sex or nudity. A rare film, indeed.
B000001FV1|4.0|Who likes Traffic Jams? I do, but with a footnote. Here's another later Traffic release that again has its moments but is not unified in its presentation, nor is it wise in its use of extended track time.    The longer instrumental songs hold up as years pass, but there is often a self-indulgent lack of optimum arrangement/editing that limits listening value, despite the positive reviews of the 'restored' original tracks.    \\"Roll Right Stones\\" is a case in point: a well-written song, with interesting parts, that nevertheless overstays its welcome, especially in the endless vocal repetitions of the title words, as if that was a memorable 'hook.' I can't help conjuring up images of 'Stonehenge' from the 'This Is Spinal Tap' movie as I listen to it. I chopped the song to under 10 minutes with some computer editing, and now I love hearing it.    Here again, though, the players do shine. Steve Winwood is simply a gifted, multi-talented musician; Jim Capaldi wrote some meaningful, poetic lyrics; and Chris Wood, though on the road to his premature death by this time, still blows some beautiful flute & creative sax effects.    Take your favorites from this recording & mix 'em with other fave's from other Traffic albums of the era & you've got some great music that opened some doors that not enough musicians have gone through since.    Try a few Traffic CD's & broaden your musical horizons!

B000FL7CAK|5.0|Season 2 of veronica mars is the best of the three seasons.  Eventhough all three are great, season 2 has so much action jamed into a single episode with a thought provoking ending to each episode which makes it a hard to put down collection set.  On top of that, The characters are well developed with a mixture of new and old creating a brilliant plot for each episode with twisted into the main store/case created in the first episode of season 2... A must buy for any person who loves television or entertainment.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|\\"The Kids Are Alright,\\" starring John Entwistle, Roger Daltrey, Keith Moon, and Pete Townshend, aka The Who, came out just after I finished 11th grade, the Summer of 1979, when everyone was still kind of raw over the loss of Keith Moon, but it was still several years before I got to see it. It played on the big screen in Pittsburgh's Stanley Theater, in a double feature, the opening film being George Harrison's \\"Concert For Bangla Desh,\\" another really fine film.<br /><br />This version of the release returns  it to its original theatrical release, several segments long missing are restored, and the sound and picture quality are refurbished as well. For years, it was only available on VHS, and with no other option, it had to suffice. But, seeing it in this version again, it is astonishing, how much the video tape suffers in comarison. The picture is now razor sharp, the sound is once again full, and the experience is what it should've been all along.<br /><br />Even if Keith Moon had lived longer, the main point to properly enjoying this movie, is to ALWAYS watch him; never take your eyes off him. Of course, the whole band is in fine form all the way through, but truthfully, Moon is the undisputed star of the film. Along with Pete Townshend, he is up there with any of the great comedians in TV and movie history. Of course, he is a drummer first and foremost, and especially in the older concert clips, he is just astonishing to watch. He wasn't often very technical, but when he cuts loose, you'll never see anyone like him. Of course, the whole band is is in top form throughout, don't put anything past them. Townshend, John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey are often at their best here as well.<br /><br />And somehow, even the material that is flawed, is still priceless to watch. There is a clip of them playing \\"Barbara Ann,\\" the old Beach Boys song, Moon doing the falsetto, and yes, it is atrocious. But somehow, this doesn't matter, it is a perfect picture of the camaraderie they had with one another. Four aggressive men who were often at one another's throats, still managed to pull off a career unlike any other, I feel they were unique here. But despite all the infighting, especially in the Russel Harty interview segments, you see a true brotherhood among them. They genuinely loved one another, and this becomes obvious in the earliest post-Moon years, when Townshend's anger at Moon dying manifested itself in a series of unflattering haircuts, public socio-political rants which nobody really wanted to hear, and the abuse of very dangerous, hard drugs. He began using cocaine, and even experimented with heroin. He nearly joined Moon one night when he was found passed out in a public men's room, and by the time he was placed in the back seat of his car, he had turned blue. Rehab followed, and virtually every essay he composed after this included some reference to Keith Moon, one of his dearest friends, being dead. He wrote what some call an \\"arrogant\\" introduction in the \\"30 Years Of Maximun R&B\\" box set, but this many years later, he is obviously still sad, and very angry at Moon for leaving us so soon.<br /><br />In 2002, just before a new tour, John Entwistle joined Moon as well, found dead in a hotel room on the eve of the tour's first date. And as talented as they are, Pino Palladino and Zak Starkey are not Entwistle and Moon. To see them now, it is still a great band, worth going to see, but seeing \\"The Kids Are Alright,\\"  or the current line-up of The Who fills one with great sadness, not only at a world without Entwistle or Moon, but the entertainment today in general. Watch the Shepperton clips of The Who, circa 1978, playing \\"Baba O'Riley,\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again.\\" Here you have four thirty-something, grown men, putting on an excellent rock show, and doing it with such aplomb, no fan wanted it to end. Now, cut to today. Turn on your TV, and you see the latest exploits of people like Brittany Spears, headed for a brick wallquicker than Moon ever did, and not very gracefully, at that. And even in his final days, Elvis Presley could wow an audience. This is what makes \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" such a treasure. It is the epitome of the heyday of rock.d not very gracefully, at that.

B0007Q6PBK|3.0|The visual reproduction is fair the audio is also fair, not nearly up to the quality of recent productions, but it's still ( a young) Pararotti and Scotto, et al and it's still Boheme.  Could be better, but still very enjoyable.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I came to \\"Funeral\\" via a wonderful festival live appearance and the grandeur of \\"Neon Bible\\", but this is where it really all began: Merge, a brave indie music label took on this rather grand but inexperienced group from Montreal and made an album which included such obscur titles as \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels\\"). While the group has gained in stature and especially confidence since and their sound has become both more amplified and grander on \\"Neon Bible, \\"Funeral\\" is a tremendous first album with most of the signature sound themes already present, with the rhythmic build up and the anthemic style. A great starting point.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Although he remains one of the best performers, I was somewhat dissapointed by the Boss' latest release after the excitement and generally very positive reviews. It is a consistent yet rather sombre exercise. There are no anthems here to dance to, no \\"Born in the USA\\", nor even a \\"Devils and Dust\\". The words and the music don't grab one by the guts. There is nothing to move one like \\"Empty Sky\\", \\"the River\\" or \\"Independence Day\\". It is almost as if too much thought went into this album and it lost its edge. Perhaps it will grow with more listening? Perhaps it is just a reflection of the pessimism pervasive today, but I can get that from CNN and hoped for more from Springsteen. Anyone wanting a treat from an old-timer should try Ray Davies' \\"Working Man's Cafe\\"/[[ASIN:B0010ZOCIU Working Man's Cafe]]
1400063515|4.0|Taleb points out several interesting problems and errors with how we are trained to think and look at history and does so with sarcasm throughout the book. While I agree with his analysis of Black Swans - events that were outside of normal expectations and not predicted, but have a large impact - but thought that he went deeper than necessary in his explanation and philosophy. As such, he gives the reader who gets the point a chance to end the book before the last substantial chapter, an offer I took because I felt that I understood the thesis and felt no need to delve deeper into Taleb's thoughts. I give the author credit for his sharp mind and the time spent thinking about this subject; I just lost interest once I believed I got his point. All in all, an interesting book with profound implications.

B00005JPTI|4.0|Just saw I Am Legend.  I enjoyed it.  I had heard years ago that they were going to remake Omega Man with Arnold Swarzenegger, and guess what? A bunch of zombie movies started springing up all over the place (Dawn of Dead remake, 28 days, Shaun of Dead, etc), but I never heard anything about Omega Man again---until, I heard that they WERE actually going to do it, but now call it by its original title, I Am Legend, and the biggest box office star in the world, Will Smith, would be the lead.  If they would have made this film back during Arnold's heyday, I think it would have been successful.  But, later on, not so much, BUT, with Smith in it right now there is no doubt this movie will be a huge moneymaker.  The comparisons to Omega Man with one of my all-time favorites Charlton Heston?  Well, I like that the \\"creatures\\" are more intelligent in Omega Man, not just pure monsters out for food.  I think most people agree that out of Heston's \\"post-apocolyptic sci-fi trilogy--Planet Apes, Soylent Green, and Omega) Omega hasn't weathered as well.  But, I think some of the best scenes in Legend are almost taken directly from Omega Man.  The driving alone through the deserted city, and some of the \\"cracking up\\" scenes with Heston, especially the telephone/booth scene is better that Smith freaking out about the empty city.  The ending scenes are quite powerful from both films, but I prefer Heston's ending as well.  So, I guess if you like scary/horror/action films, you should check out Legend.  And then maybe you should watch the Omega Man and the original with Vincent Price.  IF you don't like this stuff, then don't waste your time.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie is excellent. It is a must have for your Christmas Movie Collection. If you get the chance to see at an IMAX theatre, don't pass it up. It's like a ride at Universal Studio.
B00000J7JO|4.0|Californication was an album I had received for Christmas and was pleasently surprised how good it was. This is a rather melodic affair, basically the template for the latter day Peppers. This is a rather consistent disc much like BSSM, but without any excellent songs. Instead the songs on Californication are relatively solid. Their melodic songs  take the cake on cuts such as the Velvet Glove, Savior, Easily, and most of their biggest hits. Around the World is the perfect opener for it's usual flea bass plucking and funky guitars which turn into a spacey chorus. Parallel Universe is one of the best cuts with its speedy retro riffing by John Frusciante only to result with a jackhammer chorus. If only they wrote more songs like that one, imagine the posibilities. As usual there's filler and some crappy songs. Get on Top and Purple Stain stay stagnant in its old school funk and rapping. Also the downright boring Porcelain doesn't need to even to appear on this album. The track after Porcelain is even worse and I like dirt is serviceable but not essential. Surprisingly Californication closes with the break neck funk of Right on time only to end with the peaceful Road Trippin. The sequence of the songs are better than the songs themselves at times which is fine. This will be the last album woth owning from the Chili Peppers. Californication showed the hints at a different direction. I prayed they would not follow through with it, but you know what happened there.

B000002MTR|3.0|One Hot Minute is a disc I really wanted to like. The collection is diverse and at times exciting. Also, I wanted to see how Dave Navarro would fit into the RHCP style. Unfortunately the whole package is uneven, sometimes underdone, and forced. There was obvious tension between Dave and the rest of the Chili Peppers. It took them over a year to record this mess of an album. One Hot Minute still has some very compelling material to make it at least worth owning. Warped kicks it off in a more Jane's Addiction style with old school metal riffs and Flea's funky bass. Anthony does a good enough job to keep the song from failing. Warped is a four minute assult until it slows down to it's conclusion, a very bold song to start. Then aeroplane gives us a hummable chorus which was why this was a hit song. Deep kick is less focused but I really like it since it has grown on me. This song deals with the past experiences on the band's regret of heroin addiction. They may regret doing the drugs, but they aren't apologizing for it. Then their best track My Friends is depressing but simply beautiful. Then things turn for the worse with the generic hard rock of Coffee Shop followed by filler like Pea and One Big Mob. Walk About starts off intersting enough but then it disappears completely from my memory. Tearjerker is a good song but rather sappy, and only can listen to it occasionally. Then the half-baked title track struggles for over six minutes. Falling from Grace somehow gives trancey wah wahs followed by nice playing from Dave during the chorus. Shallow be thy name is just as stale as a song gets, nothing redeeming about it. Then the album closes with the beautiful Transcending, one of my personal favorites. One Hot Minute is definitely not a very good release, nor is it a lost cause.

0790740443|5.0|This is a fantastic science fiction movie with great action, storyline, and acting.  Kurt Russel is particularly fantastic in this because he barely even says 25 words the whole show.  Yet, he is able to portray such a complex character that transforms as the storyline unfolds.      After being trained from birth to be an elite killer soldier, following orders at all costs, and completely devoid of humanity and human feelings, Todd finds himself disposed of when he is replaced by a better soldier.  He is dumped on a waste disposal planet where survivors of a crash are living.  He lives among them and ultimately defends them when the \\"better soldiers\\" arrive on a training mission.      This movie moves very fast, so we are not bored at all.  And the storyline is so interesting, though somewhat bloody, that we are engrossed the entire time.  I recommend this for fans of science fiction and unusual science fiction since Kurt Russel does such a good job as a main character who barely speaks but tells an incredible story.
0792164903|5.0|Johnny and Christina are great in this movie, the storie is fantastic, the headless horseman and the witch, is all horrorific and well achieve, Depp plays this doctor who is kind of genious and clumsy, is a true classic!
B000AARKOO|4.0|I just read a 1 star revue by a Mr. Volk who blames the Arabs for the crusades.  The political truth is that the European crusaders were completely corrupt; they ended up sacking Constantinople on orders from the Venetians and raped and killed wantonly. It was all about greed.  Artistically, what we should be talking about the movie is excellent; and also historically accurate...

0066620996|4.0|I was required to read this book for a business class. I found this book fascinating. I do not have much business experience, but I assume that the studies and conclusions that Collins presents would be very good-to-know for anyone with a serious career or anyone interested in company success and business leadership.<br /><br />Some points from this book that I thought were interesting:<br />- Getting the right people in the company is extremely important and should be done first. (Getting the right people should be done before deciding the what and how)<br />- Great business leaders are humble. (They look out the window with success and into a mirror with failure.)<br />- Consistancy in the core values of the company are crucial. (New regimes and technologies are not as important as the momentum that core values build.)
B00005JPS9|4.0|This most famous Anglo-Saxon epic poem, the beginning of English literature, is about the hero Beowulf who slays the monster Grendel for Danish King Hrothgar played by an extremely flabby Anthony Hopkins. If that was his body we saw in the early scenes, he has indeed gone to pot. The movie which was presented on regular screens and in Imax has Ray Winstone playing Beowulf. There's a long scene in which the naked Winstone battles Grendel. The moviemakers are very skillful in avoiding any viewing of the actor's private parts. Beowulf becomes king of the Scandinavian kingdom he has saved from Grendel.<br /> Grendel's mother is played by a very sexy Angelina Jolie who seems to be playing her in the nude. She is a nasty temptress who bewitches the kings who come in contact with her. This is an action-thriller with blood and gore, corpses galore, and a flame-throwing monster dragon who comes back to haunt Beowulf. They have a mighty struggle in the last scenes of the movie.<br /> Wiglaf, Beowulf's lieutenant, is a juicy part played by Brendan Gleeson, and John Malkovich has a role as a sometime villain.<br /> It is worth seeing for the action sequences and the taste it gives of Norse customs and life. The script differs in some details from the epic itself, but the alterations make for a livelier and lustier movie.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|If you liked his Greatest Hits album (released only in Asia in 2004), you'll like this one. The lyrics are standard Williams--cheeky and swaggering. The first line of the first song announces: \\"Here I stand victorious/ The only man who made you come.\\" Ha! I read the reviews at Amazon--all good, solid reviews. I listened to it once--and found out it bore an immediate second listening. Wikipedia says it was the best selling album in Europe in 2005. Go, get!
0805079831|5.0|This is an excellent book, an incredibly and meticulously researched book.  It throws a shining light on the so-called \\"economic miracles\\" of South America (where they were precious few miracles and a whole lot of brutality), and the use of \\"shock therapy\\" (as the author Naomi Klein calls it) to force countries to adopt these ridiculous, impossibly to implement except with force economic passages.  I've always suspected these type of tactics employed by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the U.S. government, but now my good friend Naomi Klein has done incredible research and has shown, for the latter part of the 20th century, that these tactics are supported and financed by these institutions.  These economic policies (little if no social spending, tax cuts for the wealthy, everything including their organs privatitzed) are the brain child of the thankfully late Milton Friedman, an economist who preached about the \\"magic hand of the marketplace\\".  He's sort of an Ayn Rand type, except he's crueler, employing terror-like tactics to get countries to adopt these policies.  The policies never work, but never fear, Friedman and his worshippers always ended up blaming the countries themselves for not being stern enough (blaming the victim is a favorite tactic of demaogues).  Klein presents a hell of a compelling argument against this type of barbarism.  And it wasn't just South America.<br /><br />I remember seeing Costa Gavras's film State of Siege in high school, and there was a scene depicting a torture class, where a person was on stage being tortured for a class for policemen and military men (the film was based on fact).  These classes were funded by the U.S. government in order to counter the leftists in the country.  Naomi actually makes a reference to this film here (very nice), and this book shatters the illusion that only the Bush administration endorsed torture.  Bush simply doesn't have the imagination and intelligence to cover it up like past administrations did.  We also find out here that this shock doctrine was used in Russia after the Soviet Union fell (it was a disaster, and it lead to Yelstin's resignation and Putin's ascendance.  Now Putin rules Russian like a Czar), and it was also one of the underlying reasons we bombed Yugoslavia in 1999 (Clinton's talk of stopping the ethnic cleansing was really a smoke screen).<br /><br />Milton Friedman is one of those type who likes to spin right wing fairy stories, one where if we just believe hard enough, the \\"magic\\" of the marketplace will make everything OK, and if doesn't, well, there's always a junta/coup de tat we can clandestinely support to install a military dictatorship.  And after that, if that doesn't work, we'll just blame the poor people of the country for being \\"losers\\" who don't know how to implement the \\"brilliance\\" of Friedman's economic plan.<br /><br />Ideology is a drug, and Friedman and his worshippers took it without any type of self control.  Ironically, the early Communist revolutions had a similar blind belief system like this.  Of course, many will attack Naomi Klein, mainly because of her political beliefs and she's French/Canadian, which doesn't help in the eyes of Friedman worshippers.<br /><br />The book has one minor flaw.  Klein presents her hypothesis well, has an incredible amount of facts and research to back it up, but after a while it's overkill.  Ironically, she ends up being like Ayn Rand, whose novels make their points over and over and over again.  Klein does this as well.  Still, it's worth reading, and it's an eye opener.istrations did.

B000002I6T|5.0|As Grace Slick one said:\\"You have heard all the Heavy Groups, now it's time for morning mania music\\". David Crosby's first solo effort was originally panned by the rock music press- but it stands up very well today. David always had an ear for lush, breathtaking harmony (see CSNY)and it shines (although at times inconsistant)on this recording. \\"Traction In The Rain\\" is a personal fav.  The cover image is bitter/sweet, a homage for his lost Lady Christine, and his love of the sea. A watermark album of the early 1970's.

B000Q3648S|5.0|Lets swim deeper: What makes Sonic Youth so important in the history of \\"pop music\\" in the late 20th. century is that along with other NY artists such as Glenn Branca, they saw the transcendent potential of the electric guitar beyond the typical trappings of \\"rock and roll\\". The \\"No Wave\\" movement was on-board with notion as well. Is the electric guitar a classical instrument at this point in time- I think so. And the Youth's give you a first taste of this borderland on tracks like \\"The Trilogy\\". Hyperstation, is a brilliant roadmap of harmonic tightrope walking they did at this time...and with a few other tracks,they follow Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane/Starship into William Gibson CyberPunk references. Then very \\"now\\".  I only wish the original recording was not so muddy- even with the digital tools of today, why is it still so \\"harsh\\"- when it could be more \\"lush\\". Everyone who is interested in post-modern sound should own this release.
B0000060AK|5.0|IMHO, the negative comments of some about \\"Scherza infida\\" and the tempi of many arias are dead wrong.  The greatness of this production is due to its tremendous sensitivity to the dramatic possibilities of each aria.  You never feel that any of the great arias of Act 2 and 3 are static. Nor do you ever feel that the Da Capo offers the same experience as the aria's beginning.  The singers and accompaniment seize on every nuance, varying the intensity and focus of the emotions by modulating emphasis, intonation, loudness, tempo, pauses, & balance with the orchestra, so that the entire aria is an unfolding of the emotions.    To me, Minkowski's \\"Scherza infida\\" is an overpowering expression of a simply crushed young man thrown down in a moment from the height of his youthful idealism and romantic passion on the eve of his wedding. Ariodante's joyful aria (Dopo notte) and duet in Act 3 are also thrillingly emotional. (And the balance of the voices is perfect in all of the duets.)   It's definitely worth listening to this with libretto in hand, since the singing and acting is so lovingly matched to the word. And this is true of every role!
0684135051|5.0|Thank you Eliz. I discovered this book in the 1970's and it changed my knitting brain. Never before did it occur to me that knitting was just math. Gauge is how many stitches to an inch, so measure the body, and multiply; the sleeves being 1/3 of the body. How simple is that?  She then illustrates techniques via various garment styles that are astoundingly imaginative. What a practical brain! Since I hate to sew seams, it was my foray into knitting in the round. So many patterns are made for people who also sew, which gives a good strong seam, necessary for a high fashion suit jacket; but if you don't like to sew, making a sweater in 4-5 pieces isn't fun. It's torture to then have to spend a lot of time finishing it, too! I now use circular needles and try not to make sweaters with seams if I can help it!     This woman sparked my fascination with the anthropology of knitting, women who could not read or write but who kept complex mathematical knit formulas in their heads! Knit is a series of loops, crochet a series of knots! Knit in the round with colors is a thermal insulator, crochet leaves air holes, thus knit in snow country, crochet in Mediterranean, with many, many variations in between. Oh, and, yes, I did correspond with Eliz. (I was in CA, she in WI)who was very helpful in a wise motherly mentor way. We no longer consider that women should know how to sew,knit, cook nor men know how to garden, carpenter and fix. Average people used to create magnificent things for the use of their families. If you want to see current women helping women...look to the \\"Rwanda Knits\\" project giving hand knitting machines to poor women thus creating a new cottage industry for a war torn land; \\"Afghan Women's Project\\", BPeace and other ways that women are trying to help other women survive.  In fact, during the 1840's potato famine in Ireland, Scottish women taught Irish women how to make lace, linen cut work and wool sweaters with Scottish fleet patterns, provided the materials, paid them per piece, and found a market for them. Women will try whatever they can to keep other women and children from starving. My fiber fascination was sparked by this woman and this book, which changed my thinking from the Vogue knit magazine specific pattern with specific wool type, to the create your own size and design with whatever wool you have on hand type of knitting. Thank you Eliz.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|Very enjoyable film that gives of a view of what things used to be like in communist East Germany.  The film focuses on the surveillance of a coulple where the man (a writer) is suspected of seditious activity.  Once the writer is suspect, the stasi east german secret police set up base in the attic of his apartment.  They put monitoring equipment in his walls and bug his phone.  The man in charge of the monitoring changes as time goes on and lets some things intentionally go.  There is only so much he can ignore however due to the bureaucratic nature of the operation.  Eventually, things get very complicated and his career is in jeopardy.  The officer in charge of monitoring is a hardened stasi interrogator who eventually has to face his toughest subject yet... himself.    In regards to the header, the question of what happened to the typewriter was a pivotal point in the story.

B00008GKEG|5.0|If you are interested in a pretty much complete history of the Beatles, these DVD's are for you.  The narration was very informative and, since the Beatles did take part in the creation of this anthology, there is much to see and enjoy.

B000W07EKW|1.0|I purchased this collection, both as a gift, and for myself.  I got through both of the first titles but, after watching 3/4 of \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\", the DVD froze at scene 16 and would not play further.  I ruled out player defect because no other DVD has ever done this either before or since I played the Bourne movie.  This was frustrating.  There could not have been a worse spot for the DVD to malfunction - just when you've watched the majority of the film and are anticipating a big ending.  I'm returning my copy.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|I am normally hesitant about a remake.  I held my breath when read that the original Korean edition, Il Mare was going to have a Hollywood makeover.  Whilst the original movie was good, it got some bits that remained unresolved and probably would have been done better.  I'm pleased to say that this Hollywood version made the transition smoother & more cohesive.  Supporting cast is outstanding.  Special features of the movie was the extended outtakes that weren't used.  Highly recommended for the romantic hearts out there.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Once is the street magician of musicals; its natural efficiency makes Dreamgirls look like Sigfried & Roy--a sparkling make-under of its genre, and a lovely sigh of a film.<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewers that it resembles Before Sunrise in realistic style and pacing--except Once uses music in place of introspective conversation to achieve a sensory magic that only music can stimulate.  You don't even have to be a fan of this kind of music to experience the fullness of the story through it.<br /><br />Amazon's clip of the two leads (played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglov&aacute;, neither of their characters is named) first harmonizing in the music shop is the perfect selection. It comes about 15 minutes in, and is where the film (by the director's own admission) really starts. It's a very tentative moment of connection through a song, itself of searching for connection, that evokes Trufaut's \\"400 Blows\\" in the way it brings the viewer into the equation. It's a brilliant sensory parallel: While listening to the music, experiencing each note and at the same time anticipating the next in the melody, the viewer also watches in wonderment and waiting, trying to understand what is going on between these two obscure people at that exact moment, and trying to detect what they will be in the moment after that.<br /><br />The actors are both untrained, but it's neither evident nor non-evident in their performances. Sorry, that was a terribly composed sentence--what I mean is, while their performances are subtle and richly felt, they aren't \\"naturals\\" at acting; they ARE, however, naturals in their particular roles in this particular film.  They just fit, and everything about it just feels right somehow.  So much so that I wasn't at all surprised to discover that the lead actors were friends who met 6-7 years before, and that they began to see each other in a romantic light during filming. Hansard, 37, demonstrates an affecting hesitation and tentativeness around Irglov&aacute;, who is 19, that is appropriate both for the plot, and the real-life fact that she is so young.<br /><br />In the excellent commentary with the actors and director, the director notes that the original script called for a kiss, and Hansard refused and wasn't comfortable with it.  The grey area of romantic appropriateness befits the plot (the title denotes man's hesitation to act, waiting for \\"Once this-or-that happens\\"), and makes the characters' interactions more interesting, striking a perfect balance between discomfort and harmony.<br /><br />The fact that this was shot in 17 days for $175,000 is pretty amazing.  But, again, it seems to add to the film for the better, giving it an improvisational and true-to-life feeling.  The sets are real places in Dublin, adding to the sense that all this could've happened yesterday, and maybe it will happen tomorrow, you never know.<br /><br />This is just one of those rare, rare movies where all the behind-the-scenes events and interpersonal relationships are so oddly, perfectly manifest in the finished product.<br /><br />The DVD includes commentary by the actors and director on both the film and the songs.  Subtitles are accessible in English, Spanish and French so you can follow along the lyrics.  There are two brief but entertaining making-of-type featurettes as well.<br /><br />My one gripe: The R-rating is truly puzzling. On what planet, MPAA?  There is no nudity, not even a kiss, and no violence.  Some strong language, but barely that.t is appropriate both for the plot, and the real-life fact that she is so young.

B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I am reviewing the Blu-Ray quality not the movie as everyone knows what Terminator is all about.  Ok I have to say this is a Perfect Transfer for a 1980s movie on B-Ray.  Picture is so real it felt like they made it 2 months ago. (There was only 2 picture greyness when Arnie is in the hotel room Patching his eyeball and at the end when he gets blown up in the truck and transforms in the cyborg. I guess not much can be done there especially when it's a Model.  Apart from that 100% perfect picture and not to mention the sound: much sharper then the special edition DVD which had some faults.  Only Down side that I have to say is where is the Special Edition Terminator 2 Blu-Ray????   Blu-Ray is supposed to be the ultimate in storage capability and yet they still con us. I bought T2 thinking it was the uncut version but was shocked to see it was the normal movie Yuck what a big con. (Please release the uncut version)
1591841666|1.0|This book was very simple, yet it didn't convey a complete idea.    It didn't teach me anything about when to quit.  It described a Dip and a Cul-de-Sac and said to get out of a Cul-de-Sac, and know when to power through a Dip and when to recognize when it's a waste of time.    I kept reading, and waiting for the point to be made with relavant examples, but they never came.  I asked someone else to read it for her opinion, without expressing mine, and she said the same thing.    Although it's short and a quick read, I feel like it was a waste of time.  I do not recommend.  If you've read this review, you don't have to read the book - you've already got the concept!
B000TLTUL0|5.0|Tim Burton does it again with Sweeney Todd. The atomsphere is dark, oppressive and sinister mixed with the music you are sweep away into Sweeney and Burton's dark imagination. Johnny Depp portrays a crazed and believeable Sweeney and while some have complained about his singing, the soft tones of his voice are perfect for the character allowing the audience to feel for Sweeney while at the same time being replused. Helen Botham Carter is a wonderful Mrs. Lovett, funny and interesting while being the true villian of the story. All and all Sweeney Todd is a fanastic movie, not for everyone...don't take any children under 14 and be ready for some flying blood...but its a pleasure to watch, Burton, Depp and Carter weave their magic.

This time i got to listen to the whole song and from then on i loved this song. I bought the album and i havent been able to listen to the whole thing cuase itunes and downlaoding in Iraq sucks but i did get to hear two other songs, Pressure, and Emergency. and that prompted me to buy the album.<br /><br />Sorry to say i havent heard their first album. But Riot! will defeinetly be played throughout this deployment. Crush already is blasting through my barracks.<br /><br />Haleys vocals are strong and her voice is beautiful. This band rocks. Those who say this isnt real music apparently does not know what music is. What is real music anyway? The songs have a message in them if you listen to it carefully. That to me is real music. This group can go far in this buisness as long as they stay true to their music and to themselves and to their fans.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|Extremely hard, fast and zippy like supremacy but it lacks the soul of supremacy. In supremacy we had Jasons girlfried dying, we had an emotional sentiment for jason. We wanted him to avenge his girl friends death. Over here this is movie is an episodic continuation of bourne 2 so the story is same but we are not reminded of this sentiment this time. The director does not refer to it so this is an all out action flick. Its bristles and bursts with action and real good camera angles, car slams, pileups, chases, roof top jumps, martial arts fights, etc but still bournce 2 was the best of the lot, This one is an action movie from start to end but it lacks a soult that bourne 2 had.    regards, Vikram
B000002J29|5.0|I loved this when it came out on LP back in the 70's and I love it now in 2007. I guess good music never dies.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|A movie with realistic gore. The movie is crticized for sadistic gore, but its unfair to judge the movie as a censor or non approver of the genre. To rate a movie you must first enjoy the genre. You see sick horror is not everyone's cup of tea and for the people who do enjoy it, it is not a reflection of a freak sadistic nature of theirs. Its just that such movies peek our human curiosities. Its just a dare thing. Can we stand through this sick blood fest. It's also to explore the sick depravity of human nature. The stuff that happens in HOSTEL is something that serial killers do. We have heard the sordid tales. I know its gross, such sort of this violence is out there somewhere in the world happening all the time even as you read this review. Such movies just tap into our curious voyeuristic tendencies to see to what extents evil intents can hurt and kill others. In that we are just trying to do a reality check and want to get offended and turn away from the sick gore but then again we turn back and complete the movie and only to test our limits. All the gore elements are present and the gore is very realistically portrayed. The plot of internet based business elite hunting where people with money can get the satisfaction of tortuing and killing other people for 50 grand also raises questions for me  -- \\"Is is actually happening in some part of the world\\". The movie does not have the fatalistic approach of \\"Saw\\", there can be some light at the end for atleast one of our characters. Also apart from the gore, you also got suspense till atleast half way through the movie where you are trying to make sense of why all this is happening and why this sick nonsense ...whats the purpose. That is part of the fun.    regards, Vikram
B000X3KZVI|3.0|I have been a huge Mariah fan since she made Vision Of Love. She has a dynamic voice, but she is kind of narcissistic. This tour was not bad, however there needed to be a few changes. Here's the setlist  1. Intro - Rollercoaster  2. It's Like That - pretty good song, but what's up with the costume? I just thought it was a little too much and revealing.   3. Heartbreaker (Remix)/Original Version - Not my favorite song, Mariah I love you, but stop trying to dance.   4. Dreamlover - one of my favorite songs, but in the second verse she sings this remix that I'm really not crazy about.   5. My All/Morales Club Mix - love it!! My All has been one of my favorite songs for a while and I love how she adds the Morales Club Mix which is another of my favorite dance remixes.   6. Shake It Off - I liked the performance! She uses the Mimi lights just like the music video.  7. Vision Of Love - I'm so glad she performed this. Not a big fan of the dress, but I loved the vocals.   8. Fly Like A Bird - She bought it home with this one! I liked how she added a choir.   9. I'll Be There (feat Trey Lorenz) - very good. Reminded me of the MTV Unplugged version.  10. Fantasy (Remix) - pretty good. I like the remixed version better than the original. For this section, she sang on the B stage instead of the A stage.  11. Don't Forget About Us - not a big fan of this song, but the crowd seems to disagree with me.  12. Always Be My Baby - love this song! Reminds me of a summer night.   13. Honey - one of my favorite tracks from Butterfly(Mariah, please stop trying to dance!!!).   14. I Wish You Knew - she doesn't perform the entire song. Just the last chorus. Pretty upsetting because it's one of my favorites from Emancipation.  15. Can't Let Go - another one of my favorites, but she only performed the chorus :(  16. One Sweet Day - powerhouse!! Boyz 2 Men performed with her and it's such an emotional song. That's why I loved it!   17. Hero - another emotional song! I was pretty surprised whenMariah said that in the beginning, it wasn't her favorite.   18. Make It Happen - My jam!! She also bought it home establishing the choir. I was very pleased that she performed this song!   19. We Belong Together/Butterfly Reprise - I grew accustomed to this song because at first I hated it. Then after hearing it a couple of times, I liked it. Interesting song to close the show.  Overall, this DVD is decent. However, I would've changed some things:  1. the costumes were a little too skimpy and over the top.   2. The concert was way too short. Usually, concerts last about an hour and thirty minutes to two hours. This one was an hour and ten minutes I believe.   3. The DVD left out DJ Clue's spin breaks during Mariah's costume changes.   Other than that, it was a pretty good tour.
B00013UTUM|4.0|British band Muse broke out in the US with their third album \\"Absolution,\\" and establishing them as a remarkable new rock band. They're epic, intensedark, and majestic in a proggy-Pink-Floyd-meets-Led-Zeppelin kind of way, and so it's hardly a surprise that \\"Hullabaloo\\" is a remarkably strong collection.<br /><br />No, it's not a new album. Rather, it's a collection of B-sides, rarities, and a 2001 live concert. Most bands don't sound too great in either case, but Muse does. The first disc is made up of their B-sides and rarities, which tend to be quite good actually.<br /><br />It doesn't start off promising, with the schizophrenic prog-rocker \\"Forced In,\\" which would be fine if it weren't for the endlessly cycling synth that obscures everything else. But things get stronger after that, with the explosive downward spiral that is \\"Shrinking Universe\\" (\\"There's nothing left to die for!\\"), the softer poppy \\"Recess,\\" and the surprisingly gentle acoustic ballad \\"Map Of your Head.\\"<br /><br />Most of the other songs follow those examples, either being epic and bombastic or quieter and more intimate. With, of course, some eerier songs thrown in, like the rippling sweetness of \\"Shine Acoustic.\\" Are they as good as Muse's proper albums, especially since a few B-sides sound like the lost soundtrack of the X-Files? Not really, but they are remarkably good, and still better than average.<br /><br />Which brings us to the live performance, which took place in October of 2001, in Paris's \\"Le Zenith.\\" Well, to put it simply, these guys rock. It opens with a cheering crowd, right before they kick off into a tornado of bass, drums and guitar. Unlike many rock bands, these guys lose none of their power or musical richness in live performances.<br /><br />The inevitable flaw? Well, that would probably be Matt Bellamy -- he doesn't sound too different from in the albums, but it's sometimes hard to hear him above the drums, explosive synth and spiralling bass. However, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing. If Muse are known for their prowess in live performances, then it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The B-sides are a minor treasure trove, while the live album is a gem in itself, bringing their concert to life as nothing -- except a DVD -- could. A must-have for Muse fans.s hard to find a single flaw in their playing. If Muse are known for their prowess in live performances, then it's easy to see why.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I have to admit: at first, I really didn't like Rihanna. The only songs that I liked by her were SOS and Break It Off. After buying this album, my whole perspective changed about her. This album is awesome, although there are a few songs that I dislike such as Push Up On Me and Question Existing. Other than that, I like the rest of the tracks. Here's the listing:  1. Umbrealla (feat. Jay-Z): one of the hottest songs of the summer. She really didn't need Jay-Z to rap in this song.  2. Push Up On Me: I hate it!! Sounds too 80s for me.  3. Don't Stop The Music: my favorite track! I like how she samples Michael Jackson's chant (Mama se, mama sa, mama koosa) from Wanna Be Startin' Somethin. This song is definitely a club hit!   4. Breakin' Dishes: good song to workout to. You really don't wanna piss Miss Rihanna off!  5. Shut Up & Drive: another great song to workout to. It gets the adrenaline rushing when you're driving!    6. Hate That I Love You (feat. Ne-Yo): this song is okay for me. It has the same beat from Ne-Yo's Sexy Love.   7. Say It: another one of my jams. She samples Mad Cobra's Flex (Time To Have Sex).  8. Sell Me Candy: the beat is hot! Courtesy of Timbaland.  9. Lemme Get That: a cool reggae with some pretty interesting lyrics.   10. Rehab: the lyrics are awesome and it reminds me of What Goes Around...Comes Around by my boy JT.  11.Question Existing: HATE IT!  12. Good Girl Gone Bad: the song is decent.   Overall, it's not a bad CD, however I would take out Push Up On Me and Question Existing.
B000R7I3LY|3.0|The first time I heard Love Song on Sirius I thought Eh.  Not bad.  As it got more play it grew on me, so I decided to take a chance on buying the album.    Her voice does have moments when it sounds like Fiona Apple, but I think her music lacks depth.  She has a few songs that I enjoyed but I found myself getting impatient for the end of the song and hoping the next would keep my interest.  I think she sounds a little bit generic, and after many plays I still find myself gravitating to two or three songs.  Love Song is misleading because none of her other songs really sound like it, but if they did then I might've enjoyed it more.    If you read her bio on her Myspace it sounds like she might not have had as much creative freedom during the production process, so maybe her next album can have more of a distinctive sound.  I don't know, but because she has a nice voice I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.
B000WGZGNS|5.0|I love this tour. I wanted to see it when she came to Chicago, but the ticket price was outrageous! Beyonce entertained her fans through her songs, energy, dancers, and her all female band! Here is the setlist:  1. Intro Fanfare - The band plays a sample of Strawberry Letter 23 as B makes her way to the stage.   2. Crazy In Love/Crazy - she performs her first single as a solo artist and mixes it with Gnarls Barkley's version of Crazy which was pretty cool. I also like how she rips the long skirt from her costume, making it a short skirt :)   3. Freakum Dress - very sexy performance. This version is more like a rocked-out version. Loved it!!!   4. Green Light/Band Jam - I liked it. One of my favorites from the B'Day album.  5. Baby Boy/Murder He Wrote - Awesome, but this performance is more for the ladies than the men.  6. Beautiful Liar - good, but it needed Shakira.   7. Naughty Girl - sexy performance. Love the soul clapping.  8. Me, Myself, And I - liked it, but I like the Wembley Arena DVD performance better.  9. Piano Break/Dangerously In Love/He Loves Me - one of my favorite peformances from the DVD. It's very elegant and I love how she mixes Jill Scott's He Loves Me in the song.  10. Flaws and All - pretty good. Towards the end, B sheds some tears while embracing an angel.  11. Cops & Robbers Intro/Destiny's Child Medley (Independent Women Pt 1, Bootylicious, No No No Pt 2, Bug A Boo [Screwed & Chopped Mix], Bills Bills Bills, Cater 2 U, Say My Name, Jumpin Jumpin, Soldier [Soulja Boy Crank Mix], Survivor w. Kelly and Michelle) - loved it. My favorites were Bills Bills Bills and Say My Name. I like how she did the Souja Boy Dance with her dancers.  12. Speechless - I think she could've left this number out.  13. Jailhouse Confessions/Ring The Alarm - HOT! The intro is HOT!!! This is the song where she fell on the flight of stairs at the Orlando show. She didn't fall off of this performance which was good.   14. Suga Mama - pretty hot! I've learned to like this song and I love the performance  15. Upgrade U (feat Jay-Z) - not my favorite song by her, but Jay-Z made a special performance with B.  16. 03 Bonnie & Clyde/Prince Mix - okay, not my favorite.   17. Check On It (Special Tour Version) - LOVED IT!! It cracked me up and it was sexy at the same time.  18. Deja Vu - that's my song and Beyonce's! Wished she sang the second verse, but the performance was great!  19. Bass Jam/Bee Intro/Get Me Bodied (Extended Mix) - She bought it home!! My favorite song and performance from B!   20. Welcome To Hollywood - it's just the song and never before seen footage of Beyonce. Pretty good to watch as B makes her costume change.  21. Dreamgirls - Very interesting! I wish she would've performed the whole song.   22. Listen - Awesome!!   23. Irreplaceable/B'Day Surprise - To the left! To the left! Great song to close the show as well as B's birthday surprise.   Overall, it was a great show. I could watch it a million times and still love it
B000H5V8DG|1.0|I my husband bought me this set as a gift for Christmas, and I couldn't wait to open it.  When I did, I found that the entire set was scratched and dirty.  I haven't been able to watch a single episode.  I am so disappointed.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|Very impressed with the package deal!  Amazon had the best price I could find.  Mr Page did an excellent job putting it all together!  All the collectible items were really cool.  It was great to receive the item just before my trip to London to see the reunion in London.  Must say that Led Zeppelin still has it!  Solid performers!
B000YMBBH0|5.0|It was my impression that all three of the Jason Bourne DVDs in this bundle were HD-DVD and DVD combos; in other words, you can play them on either a HD player or reguilar. The first and third were marked as such, but the second clearly stated \\"plays only on HD-DVD players.\\" Since I don't have an HD-DVD player (though may purchase one in the future) I was very disapointed with this amazon.com exclusive that didn't have enough thought put into it.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|I'll admit that I am a huge Zep fan and for me, they can do no wrong. In this production of SRtS, Page put the magic needed to make the video quality pop and the audio is incredible! Of course I have the old version for comparison, so I can say, Zep did this for the fans. Sure it is dated and the \\"dream\\" sequences may be a little much, but listen to the haunting vocals on Dazed while it rolls through 5.1 surround system and tell me Zep wasn't masters of mixing and live performance. For my money, this was a bargain and it took me back to Dallas 77. You won't be sorry adding this to your Zep collection.
0553208845|4.0|Siddhartha centers around a young man's desire to go out and explore the world, finding out on his own the paths, pitfalls, and destructive forces within one's nature. One of the key elements is Siddhartha choosing his own destiny--whatever that may be-- and having to work with the results. Through a character change, he is able to find redemption.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most effective aspects of Hesse's novel is just the way it is written. His prose and detail make this story such an easy read, yet there is a deep, underlying poetic tone that affirms its message about individual quest and salvation. The story of Siddhartha venturing out from his parents and friend, and leaving despite his encounter with the Enlightened One, really becomes parallel to the story of the lost son who must find his way back home (in this sense, the idea of home is spiritual).<br /><br />Once Siddhartha leaves the life of the Samanas, he becomes drawn into the life of wealth, flesh, and excess: \\"The world had caught him; pleasure, covetousness, idleness, and finally that vice that he had always despised and scorned as the most foolish-- acquisitiveness. Property, possessions, and riches had also trapped him.\\" He seemingly must continue to go down deeper out of himself, and fall into eventual despair before he rises.<br /><br />The real awakening he experiences comes at his lowest point. As he contemplates suicide by a river, he hears the sound from the depths of his soul that turns the tide of his outlook-- the sound of \\"Om\\", the prayer, which translates to \\"The Perfect One.\\" There he understands the mistake he is about to commit, and the transformation begins, but not before going through other struggles.<br /><br />The story really is a testament to the philosophy that one must listen to the voice in their life guiding them to the right choice. Although Siddhartha makes many foolish mistakes along the way-- he fails to listen to fatherly advice, or counsel from his friend, or even words from their spiritual leader-- yet, it is almost critical for him to make these mistakes to gain a greater sense of himself. The journey into mistakes and correcting of these is as important as hearing that voice that guides.l leader-- yet, it is almost critical for him to make these mistakes to gain a greater sense of himself. The journey into mistakes and correcting of these is as important as hearing that voice that guides.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I have listened to A LOT of music in my life and I have rarely heard anything that grabbed my attention as quickly as this soundtrack did.  There isn't anything about it that is lacking.  The lyrics are amazing and are supported by some incredible music.  There is a curious mix of rock, classical and carnival that totally works!  Thanks to Sixx:A.M. for putting this soundtrack together and intense blessings to Nikki Sixx!  If he didn't have a Life After Death none of us would be able to share this experience with him!  If you haven't done it yet, check out 'The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star'.  Reading that will bring more clarity to the music and the sales of both benefit and awesome charity - Running Wild in the Night.

B00005JNS0|4.0|Our copy of this DVD has been played more times than I can count since my kids got it for Christmas 2006. It's a fairly long movie with a lot of action, which is perfect for car trips to Grandma's house 100 miles away.    At first, I wasn't crazy about the voice of Lightning McQueen or even of Doc Hudson, but they've grown on me. And with Larry the Cable Guy as the voice of Mater, there are some screamingly funny parts to the movie. I didn't think the plot was that predictable, as others have written. The end was not what I expected, which was good.    If you watch this on a large enough screen, you'll find that even the insects are cars. They leave tiny little tire tracks on the windows when they crawl on them. Oh, and watch for the tire tracks that some of the airplanes leave in the desert sky...
B000XPU5NY|5.0|Having been a Genesis fan for 20 odd years I think they're still a great band and so is this cd of their comeback tour. It was great to hear Phil and the guys again.
0891419195|4.0|My father (now 92) fought at both Pelileu and Okinawa, as did the author Eugene Sledge.  Despite the fact that his generation rarely talks about WWII, he was thrilled to get this book and read it straight through.<br />It's not only accurate, it is very moving.  A great insider's look at two of the worst battles in the Pacific.
B00005JPTI|5.0|I can see why this movie is getting wildly disparate reviews.  It is not what it was marketed as: a horror/SF/zombie popcorn flick. It's not even an action movie or a thriller, although it does contain elements of those genres.        So, what is it?  It's a darkly inspiring, bleak, existential drama that looks at the price that heroes quite often pay for living out their ideals.     The main (virtually the only) character is a research scientist living in a post-apocalyptic NYC, who is struggling to find a cure for a monstrous virus that has claimed 90% of the world's population.  Most of the survivors have been turned into vicious, inhuman ghoul-like creatures that rule the night.        Smith is one of the few humans that is naturally immune to the virus, and his decision to stay is motivated by his belief that he can find an effective treatment for the illness.  Unfortunately, many of the pitiful victims he wants to help are now inhuman monsters that try very hard to kill him.    Smith lives in NYC alone, his only companion a female German shepherd.    He spends the sunlit hours playing golf, watching movies and researching the virus that caused the global holocaust.     But, when the sun starts to set, he retreats to a fortified house in the city, where he endures the sounds of the \\"dark seekers\\", the creatures that have been created by the disease, stalking the streets outside while he tries to sleep.     Most of the film revolves around Smith dealing with the consequences of staying in the city, instead of leaving it before it was sealed off.    Those consequences include maddening loneliness that drives him to talk to mannequins, memorize film lines and treat his canine friend more like a human child than a dog.        Be aware: this is not a happy movie, and the ending is both depressing and hopeful.  Smith pays a horrific penalty indeed for his decision to stay in the city and fight the disease.    The most gripping scene in the film to me was Smith lockedin a room sealed by a glass door, with the creatures breaking in.  He pleads with them to stop trying to kill him, not out of fear, but out of his desire to cure the illness that has turned them into monsters.  But their cries of hatred and blood lust drown him out.       I think that the scene says something very profound about the sad depravity of human nature, and our tendency to destroy the very things that offer us an escape from the unrelenting meaninglessness of our lives.    So, in summary: don't go to this film looking for a special effects extravaganza, although the special effects are actually quite good.  Don't go looking for a shoot 'em up thrill ride, although there is plenty of shooting and creatures getting blown away.  If you go, expect a profoundly moving human drama that, if you open your heart to its message, will cause you to think deeply about the reality of evil, and the price we may have to pay to defeat it.    Recommended to the highest degree.

B000VWYJ86|3.0|What a fantastic, action-packed film. A great group of characters, well-acted, great special effects. The camera angles were intentionally choppy and disjointed. Very uncomfortable to watch. I wanted to see the hand-to-hand fight scenes, but the filming (designed to make it \\"feel\\" like a fight) obscured everything. That made it less enjoyable. A+ for all but the filming, which was a C-.

There are so many wonders around the world that you will be stumped and raise your eyebrows and say \\"WWooWW\\".  This would have been such a great set if and only if they included the Planet Earth Future feature.  It's kind of weird that they include this feature on the DVD format, and not on the BluRay or the HD-DVD (HD-DVD needs to die).  But, other than that, this is a great documentary and wonderful addition to your collection, Do Not Hesitate!!  Go Get It NOOOOWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!
B000V6BE6M|5.0|Having enjoyed the first two Complete Lord of the Rings Recordings by Howard Shore, I was delighted to see the third and last finally released.    It is great to sit quietly and relive the movie through the wide range of Shore's musical expressions - the grand sweeps over the landscapes, the more silent and intimate moments intermixed with the subtle use of solo vocals and choirs, the small rush of joy when the various themes creep in and out of the score. And, just before the end, Annie Lennox will move you Into the West with her beautiful, emotional voice.    Well, what can I say. If you were touched by the music, when you watched the movie, I am sure you will enjoy this 4 CD edition, that allow you to listen to the pure orchestral music of Howard Shore without background noises.    Surround Sound lovers may appreciate the accompanying DVD with the score recorded in 24 bit, 5.1 audio.    Please, enjoy!
B000TLTUL0|1.0|I am going to keep this very simple-I thought the film was terrible, boring & stupid-and I can't believe I wasted $8 on this junk!!!!!
B000MZHW40|5.0|This is one of the best political films I've ever seen. It has intensely-thrilling action, wonderful acting, and stunning political implications. I saw it and I was gripped for the entire 143 minutes.    This film is based upon the chaotic political and economic struggles in west Africa in the late 1990s. The movie begins with Leonardo DiCaprio as a diamond smuggler from South Africa, working in Liberia and Sierra Leone. A few minutes into the film, he crosses the path of a man names Solomon (played by Djimon Hounsou) who has had his life destroyed by the Sierra Leone civil war. The twist here, is that the rebels receive their guns by trading diamonds with the more powerful countries that thoughtlessly fuel the African diamond trade. DiCaprio is a cynic who tends to blame everyone; he is thus unsympathetic to Solomon's attempts to find his family. Soon, a third major character, an American journalist played by Jennifer Connelly, enters into the fray. She is determined to document the diamond trade and unravel the tragedies of humanity within western Africa. What makes this film so interesting is the connection between DiCaprio, Hounsou, and Connelly even though they are all fighting for different and opposite goals.    Through beautifully-shot cinematography, mind-blowing intensity, and remarkable political relevance, BLOOD DIAMOND is one of the most gripping films of the year. It really does deserve all of its Academy Award nominations. Watch it and you will be absolutely gripped, forced to rethink your philosophies about world connections and the masked corruption that exists in economic policy today.
B000G8NVHA|4.0|It's not really soul music at all to be honest. It's pop music with an R&B twist here and there, as well as a handful of clever hip-hop samples from time to time and some ballads. The are also some songs about rough times. But that's no surprise - We've come to expect just a little depth from this 26 year old fireball. But whatever Christina is doing, she's usually speaking her mind and never holding back, which I, as others, highly admire.<br /><br />She delves sort of deep and gives you her all. I appreciate that she is contemporary pop's best voice and probably will remain for a while. All the luck to her really.<br /><br />The lyrics to this CD are pretty good, especially for pop music but she still has room for a little growth. She can also do without so many songs about her lovely hubby, Jordan. We got the point before this experience was over.<br /><br />It has its moments where it really shines, but honestly, nobody but hardcore fans should have to pay the 17 bucks amazon and other stores are selling it for. Just because it's a double disc doesn't mean you're getting extra stuff, besides a lousy video or so. I have seen amazon in the past, selling it for 11.99 which I thought was fitting, but now it has skyrocketed back to its over-bloated price. >_><br /><br />It's a shame that her and Scott Storch went through it because he helped her write some great songs on her last outing. He also produced a great amount of the songs there.<br /><br />What are my favs here?<br /><br />Disc 1<br /><br />Ain't No Other Man<br />Understand<br />Slow Down Baby<br />F.U.S.S. (Interlude)<br />Here To Stay<br /><br />Disc 2<br /><br />Welcome<br />I Got Trouble<br />Save Me From Myself<br /><br />Like I've mentioned before, she's got the vocals, she's got the incredible, almost Mariah Carey-like range (which I find amazing, and she can do it better, with the better voice and all) and she's got the skills to write a decent song to pass the time.<br /><br />I have written a review about this CD before but am much prouder of this one.

B000V6BE6M|4.0|I have been waiting for this release to complete my 'Lord of the Rings' collection. Great to have ALL music of the third film too. I must say that, in comparison, the music of The Two Towers seems to have more different themes. However, this album is a welcome release!
B00005JPTI|4.0|I am a big Will Smith fan, and a sci-fi fan, and I like exploring the concept of being the last man on Earth, so I just had to see this movie.    Will Smith does a superb job with the material he is given.  It rings true every step of the way.  I will not go into exactly what happens every moment of the movie, and there will be no spoilers here.  Instead, ask yourself if you would like to bond with Robert Neville, the character Mr. Smith plays, and go along on his dedicated journey to save lives, maintain sanity, and survive while avoiding imminent danger.  Also ask yourself if you would like a good cry.  This movie has a few tearjerking moments, and if you have any heart at all you will probably shed at least one tear.  This movie may not be perfect, but if you like the idea of Will Smith in this role you should see it at least once.

B000WQW988|5.0|I miss him so much. This is an exhilarating and sad farewell from a man at the end of his tether. Notice the quick but chilling stare Cobain gives the audience as he sings the last line of \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\" and tell me you aren't moved. Musically speaking, \\"Unplugged\\" is faultless with exquisite renderings of lesser known but loved album tracks (my favorite being the gorgeous version of \\"Polly\\" the highlight of which is Dave Grohls' heavenly backing vocals) and a raw, riveting solo performance of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\". Great songs, terrific 5.1 surround sound and a crystal clear picture. Indespensible.

0811806405|5.0|I just finished spending two weeks building a guitar with William Cumpiano in his shop and I have to say it was a great experience and produced a great guitar, which I believe you can do directly from this book in a similiar way. I love the depth of information here and the care with which it's presented, a direct reflection of the authors' personalities. When working with just the book you need to go slow, be sure you understand exactly what you are doing before you do it, and stay alert to what is going on with your guitar as it evolves. A wonderful book that distills a lifetime of experience and I can say for a fact that the methods described work perfectly.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I absolutely loved the 1989 Batman movie with Micahel Keaton and Jack Nicholson, so when I learned they were going to discard that and start from a clean slate, I was a bit bothered.  The other three films that follwed the 89 version didn't bother me at all, in fact, I rather hated those.  Sure enough, after seeing Batman Begins it couldn't really fill the place as a prequal to the 89 version.  Events had already been retold.  But after a few viewings of this Christopher Nolan masterpiece, I had began to make the transformation over to the new series, as it really is one of the finest comic book films ever created - period.<br /><br />I can't think of one bad thing to really say about this film.  Unlike some comic book movies, this one takes itself very seriously (yet still holds a certain amount of humor too).  The 1989 Batman had a bit of serious edge to it, and its followers disregarded that.  Begins is like the 89 version, only more.  The story goes deep.  We not only learn of how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, but we literally follow him step by step and get into his mind.  There are complications that go beyond simple revenge of his parent's death.  Bruce must administor justice, but how can justice be properly used in such a corrupt society as Gotham?  Its a very intriguing story, and the characters are fantastic, adding to the depth.  An incredible mixed cast of Liam Neeson, Micahel Caine, Morgan Freeman and Katie Holmes are a few of the actors that shine in this film.  Then there is Christian Bale, who brings a dark toughness to the role of Batman we have never seen before.  Indeed, the movie as a whole is very dark, but with enlightening messages.<br /><br />The action is pretty tough in this film too.  The fights aren't too flashy, but more realistic than in prior films.  The new batmobile is actually more like a tank, called the Tumbler.  Unlike the previous batmobiles, this one is a little less flashy, but fully armed and can crush anything.  One of the most exciting parts of the film is when the Tumbler is being chased by cops throuhgout the town, and creates quite the wreckage along the way.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the great things about this film, but it is honestly worth seeing.  If you are skeptical about remakes, like me, this one will probably win you over once you realize how good it is.  Especially since they are coming out with the sequal the Dark Knight which appears to be on the same level as this film, I can easily dismiss the older Batman titles in favor of the new series.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5s of the film is when the Tumbler is being chased by cops throuhgout the town, and creates quite the wreckage along the way.

0375842209|5.0|What can I say about this beautifully-written, transcendent novel that hasn't already been said?  Except that I read it aloud to my special needs daughter and she was transfixed by it.  It was quite difficult reading it toward the end because I was crying.  If there is an audio version, I certainly do commend the actor who read it because I couldn't get through the last part without weeping.  This is the sort of book that changes lives.  It deserves all the accolades it has received.<br /><br />A beautiful novel!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I and maybe a few other fans of the original Die Hard films were probably a bit worried about an addition to the series after all these years (and thank God it was an addition and not a remake which seems to be the Hollywood trend these days).  Die Hard is just impossible to beat, the very first one.  It is arguably the #1 action movie of all time.  Indeed, Live Free or Die Hard can't beat the classic, but I'd have to say it surpasses the others.<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the visuals and the sound.  I was blown away in the theatre, and just as blown away at home.  Visually, the effects are tremendous, accompanying several new and creative action scenes.  The sound is littered with gun fire, hard puches and kicks, and explosions througout the film.  You feel right in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The story is your basic Die Hard terrorist plot, but has been upgraded to the 21st century, focusing on computers and networking.  The terrorists take down networks causing mass panic begining on the eastern seabord.  John McClane once again finds himself in the middle of the action, and protecting a young man who had been targeted for execution after his services had been accomplished.  The lead villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, was as sinister as they come.  I enjoyed his character, but the actor could have been a bit sharper in the role.  His girlfriend, played by Maggie Q, seems to do most of his dirty work, and is skilled in martial arts, giving McClane one heck of an action fight mid-way throught the film.<br /><br />Though the story is intriguing because it ivolves all the high tech stuff this time, the real fun of the movie always comes back to the action - and there is more than plenty throughout the film.  The film begins with some great gun fire scenes - which carry the feel of a video game.  Oddly enough, there are multiple scenes of \\"Gears of War\\" on people's computers in the film.  There are some great car chase scenes, especially one where McClane takes out a flying helicopter with a car - huh? - its a must see to believe.  Then there's the finale with McClane in a big rig dodging heavy gunfire from a fighter jet between highway bridges.  Those are just some of the bigger action scenes, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must own action pleaser.  CGI has taken over in this Die Hard, but it is used to the fullest.  The characters do their jobs fine, and there is even plenty of humor to keep you laughing in and between all the action.  It is a perfect blend of serious action, fun charcaters, and good humor.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5es out a flying helicopter with a car - huh? - its a must see to believe.

B000RMQH30|5.0|Okay, so I can't bestow a prize on Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals. But I would if I could!  I loved this CD.  It's in continual rotation on my CD player.  I know all the songs by heart.  And boy is my heart happy!  Yes, I'm a fan, as anyone who knows me is fully aware.  This band's music speaks to me.  Maybe it's because their sound is kind of retro, kind of today, kind of universal.  I love all kinds of music, just so it moves me emotionally.  The music and words of LIFELINE definitely do that.  Was it nominated for a Grammy?  If not, it SHOULD have been! As a couple of other reviewers have said: It's music to groove to.  You rock, guys!

B000WZAE1I|5.0|I read the book years ago.  No, Mr. Gaiman wasn't able to precisely follow the book's story line.  It must be difficult turning a classic (in my opinion) into a film.  But this was a rousing adventure!  Some scenes were not suitable for children.  But then this story was never meant for children. Perhaps for the children in us.  I especially enjoyed Mr. DeNiro's performance as the effete leader of the pirates.  And Michelle Pfeiffer looked as if she was really enjoying playing the evil witch.  I say: You'll be missing a good movie if you pass on this.  But don't allow the kiddies to watch it alone.
B000UBMSB8|3.0|I BOUGHT THE 4 DISC SET BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEAST EXSPENSIVE WAY TO GET THE NARRATED VERSION ON DVD. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THE DVD YEARS AGO(THE DIRECTORS CUT)AND IT WAS LEFT OUT.  THE BEST VERSION IN MY OPINION IS THE ONE RELEASED FOR EUROPEAN THEATERS.  IT'S JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL U.S. VERSION WITH ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE (LESS THAN 10 MINUTES) OF MOSTLY VIOLENCE. THE \\"FINAL CUT\\", I WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT, WAS A BIG LET DOWN.  I WANT THE NARRATION, AND THE \\"EXTRA\\" STUFF WAS HARDLY NOTICABLE\\".  I ALSO LIKE THE \\"HAPPY\\" ENDING OF THE ORIGINAL.
0684135051|5.0|I always learn something new from Elizabeth the Goddess.  Best tomten jacket pattern ever!
B000002J0B|4.0|This is a grandiose album, which veers from the exquisite epic to downright overindulgence.  Like no other Zeppelin album this showcases them at their best and worst.  The best - and there is a lot of it - is in the exhilirating wall of guitars sound of 'The song remains the same', the meticulously crafted and played ballad 'The rain song' and the brooding epic 'No quarter'.  Elsewhere, 'Over the hills and far way' starts off brilliantly with acoustic guitars and an exciting electric change before descending into something rather more mundane. 'The Ocean', a live favourite, is a funky memorable riff basically masquerading as a song. 'Dancing days' is a similar one riff type of song with none of the charm of other one riff songs like 'Whole lotta love'. 'D'yer mak'r' is absolutely self-indulgent and trite, only liked by Zeppelin obsessives and Bonham fans and 'The Crunge' would never get away with its' white-man funk were it by any other band. So, worth it for 3 or 4 of the tracks and brilliant album artwork (best seen on the vinyl) but not an essential album to purchase by any means.
B0000549B0|5.0|I watched it for the first time when I was 21 and single.  I've watched it through the years.  Now I watch it (and own it) with my kids and family (I am 41) and the magic still remains.  This movie has magic. Josephine Hull is unforgettable.
B000002J09|5.0|By the time Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham began recording this - their fourth album - many critics thought Led Zeppelin may have been a two hit wonder.  A great live band in an era of great live bands who'd made an apparently rather lacklustre third album, they seemed to be on unstable ground...    All these years later we forget the reverent hush on hearing the first bars of 'Stairway', the expectations surrounding the fourth album, the aura of mystique centring on the seemingly throw-away cover.  Instead of a title, this album had four runes, which people soon realised stood for the four band members.  As a statement, the unlettered cover smacked of the self-confidence of Led Zeppelin.  It hinted at the mystery and rock n' roll swagger of the music inside.  A photo of a burdened old peasant strangely hangs on the shabby wall of a crumbling, derelict urban English house.  In the drab unstable gloom of post-war Britain and a new decade (this came out in 1971) Led Zeppelin hark back to a particularly English pastoral idyll and their own unique take on the blues - represented by the photo.  The combination of such factors lend what became known as Led Zeppelin IV a continuing charm and fascination.  More than any other of their excellent albums, it crystallizes their potency, competence and vision and, as such, Page is very proud of it today.    Where else could such an album begin for Led Zeppelin but with a call and response blues song? 'Black Dog' begins with such an electrified take and carries us from the roots of the blues to the sexual braggadoccio and excitement of Zeppelin in their prime. A crushing turnaround riff, a thundering Bonham, a moaning Plant, a classic Page solo and a very politically incorrect set of lyrics made this a live favourite:    'Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move  Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove.  Oh, oh, child, way you shake that thing  Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting.  Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way  Watch your honey drip, cant keep away.'    'Rock and Roll' is a tribute to the exciting music they grew up and loving and often covered live (see the live at the Albert Hall 1970 performance).  Jones plays a pastiche of Little Richards on the piano and it became one of their live favourites.    'The battle of evermore' takes us to a deeper and older place and ultimately prepares us for the tour-de-force of 'Stairway'.  It fades in like the Sibelius Violin Concerto, in a haunting fashion.  This is deliberate: it is a musical technique that lets us gradually enter a different mood and it allows our ears to become accustomed to the change in tone and structure.  Here, we hear an ethereal and otherworldy piece of music.  Yes, it's had critics mocking Tolkienesque lyrics and it was savaged in the 'back to basics' years of Punk and 'Spinal Tap' but let us not forget these were less cynical times and, like on the latter part of Zeppelin III, it deliberately joins bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle in celebrating the tradition of British folk music.  Much that is thematic in Tolkien's writings is in sync with the wistful melancholy of English writers such as Eliot, Hardy, Lawrence and poets such as Claire.  Where punk celebrates nihilism, this celebrates mythological optimism.  Page and Jones weave a tapestry of mandolins and guitars and Plant and Sandy Denny writhe in and around the melody calling in the refrain to 'bring it back'. Bring what back?  Ultimately, they mean something deeper - a simpler time, a rural elysium - which naturally takes us to the message of...    ...'Stairway to Heaven'.  So much has been already expostulated on this song that it hardly seems necessary to comment; and yet so much of what has been written deals with it mythologically.  If we strip away these layers of myth what we are left with is a very moving song, something that is ultimately very original (even if naysayers do decry it as copying a song by Spirit). It deals with life's choices and either becoming a strong, good, happy, optimistic soul or an insecure, materialistic and embiitered soul.  The lady 'who's sure all that glitters is gold' is the rich, acquistive person or society following a life of riches and, ultimately, spiritual poverty.  The 'piper' and 'the songbird' allow us to consider a life of spiritual richness.  So we have two choices.  In the end, it is better 'to be a rock and not to roll' or to be stalwart and strong and not face a life of indecision and waywardness - like a 'rolling stone'.  Parodied by many since, 'Stairway' is a hymn for spiritual joy from the tail end of the hippy dream, something Plant was particularly enamoured with.  As one prevailing ethos becomes another, 'Stairway' strikes varying chords with the listener.  But one should not mistake sincerity for solemnity and idealism for naivety.  Plant was a youthful idealist and with the wistful tune by Page and Jones's 'piper'-like organ, this song speaks to the youthful idealist in all of us.    'Misty mountain hop' - no clues as to what Plant was reading at the time! - is social observation dealing with drop-outs and the hippy dream in America.  It talks of 'Crowds of people sittin on the grass with flowers in their hair' and getting high at a festival or gathering of some kind.  Suddenly what should happen but a policeman starts arresting people only to paw sycophantically at Plant and co:    Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us said,  Please, hey, would we care to all get in line,  Get in line.  Well you know,  They asked us to stay for tea and have some fun,  Oh, oh, he said that his friends would all drop by, ooh.    None too impressed, Plant thinks the police are hypocrites who can't wake up to the harmless joy of the young, hippy crowd:    Why dont you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see,  And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?   There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustinThe young people aren't playing the same old political games as tghe police and the establishment.  They don't care about politics, they just want to have some fun and be happy:    Folk down there really dont care, really dont care,  Dont care, really dont  Which, which way the pressure lies.    So Plant decides to 'hop it' (English slang) 'over the hills' to his Tolkienesque vision again (the Misty Mountains) and go somewhere else so that his spirit isn't bummed out by the depressing scenes between the hippies and the establishment in America.      Lyrically, this song harks back to the Buffalo Springfield subject matter of 'For what it's worth' - something Zep sometimes part-covered live.  Instrumentally, this contains another archetypal Page riff, storming its way through the song, propelled by funky keyboards and - as ever - Bonham's solid timekeeping drumming.    'Four sticks', so-named because Bonham plays with four drumsticks here, contains a broadly Eastern-influenced tune, with a growling riff.  The chorus and bridge section contain the first use of sythesizer by Zeppelin, layers of vocals and an acoustic guitar overdub - saturating the tape in a howling mix that snarls and crackles with Plant often at the top end of his vocal range.    'Going to California' is thematically dedicated to Joni Mitchell, the 'California' girl singer-songwriter who took introspective songwriting to high art.  Page and Plant were awed by her tunings and thrilled to her singing. She is the 'girl out there  with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair', the 'queen without a king' who 'plays guitar and cries and sings'.  Plant deals with the ideal woman, the unattainable myth and of questing for her like an Arthurian knight for his lady:    Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn  Tryin to find a woman whos never, never, never been born.  Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,  Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.    It is a moving song, something allof us who've been possessed by youthful ideals and a sense of longing may have felt.    The album ends with a take on a traditional blues song 'When the levee breaks'.  Multi-layered guitars, the quintessential Bonham drum track (often sampled since), wailing harmonica and Plant moaning, screaming and crying like never before or since take Zeppelin the deepest into the blues they perhaps ever got.  It sounds dark and epic and hints to the future and 'Physical Graffitti'.    Buy this album and take the time to let it seep into your unconscious. It is one of the best albums ever made.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great series for people from 5 to 95. The cinematography is breathtaking and the narration is informative and entertaining.
B000002J03|3.0|Somehow this often makes lists of the greatest albums ever made. This sophomore effort pales after the thrilling debut.  There is less passion throughout, something Page admitted as much when suggesting it was because he'd been playing most of these songs for the best part of a year.  It mines blues cliche in 'Killing floor' parody 'The lemon song', which just comes across as self-indulgent instead of particularly humorous. 'Whole lotta love', while a great live song but vastly overrated when set against their overall canon, sounds a little trapped in its' studio effort.  'Livin lovin maid' has a great riff but sounds like a self-parody and has a lazy set of lyrics.  'Moby dick' is a throwaway riff and a drum solo that sounds absurd on record.  'What is and what should never be' introduces the effective sensitive side of Plant before sounding plodding again and 'Thank you' is a lovely song that occasionally slips into maudlin sentimentality.  The highlights are terrific. 'Heartbreaker' is very tight with a great middle section (but still sounds overproduced), 'Bring it on home' introduces one of their best riffs and a great vocal and 'Ramble on' contains two of Pages's best solos and is easily the best song on the album.  In terms of rock history, this album is enormous, but objectively it lacks the passion of Led Zeppelin I and the production and passion of Led Zeppelin III.

0743486285|5.0|It was the summer of 1982 or possibly 1983.  The kid I knew next door to my parents vacation spot was very into Motley.  I was 13 or so.  He played me Merry Go Round and I was hooked.  I watched them rise to an incredible apex, had their posters on my walls.  I looked up to this band.  I first had the opportunity to see them live on 10/17/87, Day On the Green in Oakland.  At that moment, I knew what entertainment was all about.<br /><br />When I read this book, and later met Nikki in person, I realized what we all see with rock bands is such a smoke screen.  He peeled back the onion to show us what really was going on back then.<br /><br />Of course he made a ton of mistakes, just like the rest of us.  But he had the ability to write it down as it happened.  This is a rare look into an explosively popular band, with a destructive band member.<br /><br />This book should be standard reading in schools.  It would let kids know that drugs are not the popular cool thing to do, but something that can even destroy someone with the drive of Nikki.<br /><br />Nikki - I am glad to hear that you could move beyond your upbringing and find peace.  Thank you for your years of great music, and mostly thank you for showing that we are all human.<br /><br />One Love!

If you enjoy history, Cate, Feinnes, gorgeous costumes, great acting, and panoramic character development, get this film.

B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is super - probably deserves more than 5 stars. My favorite  music DVD.     Sound, video, songs +++++    This should be required viewing for production  people making  a music video.     Since we can't see Pink Floyd perform, and  if you can't see or can't afford a Roger Waters concert:  check out the  Australian Pink Floyd Show if they are in your area.  They perform Pink Floyd songs near-perfectly, the sound is excellent, and  the cost is much less than many concerts.
B000IONL40|5.0|I don't even know where to start. I'm a HUGE Meat Loaf fan, and personally never been disappointed in any album hes done. Nothing more needs to be said about how awesome Bat 1 and 2 were or even how awesome other songs like \\"Couldn't have said it better\\",\\"I'd lie for you..\\",\\"Not a Dry eye in the hosue\\" are (the list goes on and on). Bat out of Hell 3 is just flat out amazing from \\"the Monsters loose\\" to \\"Seize the Night\\". It also finally brings along the definitive version of \\"It's all coming back to me\\" which is a great great ballad. The true gem of this album is Blind as a Bat, which for me ranks right up there with \\"I'll do anything for love\\".    Anyone who doesn't think this is a great album or a sub par bat out of hell album is either delusional or doesn't appreciate just how great Meat Loaf is..

How's it hang'n?<br /><br />Don:  Uh,it's headed south -- kind of like my solo career ever since<br />  we broke up as the Eagles.<br /><br />Glenn:  Uh yeah --I know what you mean.  HOW LONG since you had a<br />  a real hit on the radio?<br /><br />Don:  Hey man, I've been WAITIN IN THE WEEDS for some time now for that<br />  to happen!<br /><br />Glenn:  YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Everybody keeps saying how we just don't<br />  measure up to our old stuff we did as the Eagles and....<br /><br />Don:  Stop!...I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE!!  I've heard it all before!<br /><br />Glenn:  Too bad we could'nt all get along and just keep the band together<br />  without ever breaking up, huh?<br /><br />Don:  Well, ya know it was mostly our HUGE egos (mine and yours)that<br />  caused us to part and go our separate ways.<br /><br />Glenn:  Yeah, we were definitely -- GUILTY OF THE CRIME!<br /><br />Don:  We were TOO BUSY BEING FABULOUS - too busy to think about us...(the group).<br /><br />Glenn:  No doubt about it...we definitely had a FRAIL GRASP ON THE BIG<br />  PICTURE as to what would happen if we split up.<br /><br />Don:  Between the two of us, SOMEBODY should have been smart enough to see coming.<br /><br />Glenn:  We gotta DO SOMETHING about this,...but what!??<br /><br />Don:  Hey!  I've got a GREAT idea! The fans have been wanting us to<br />  get back together since we broke up, right?  Since neither of<br />  us are getting NOWHERE FAST (Fast Company) in our solo careers,<br />  why not get the band back together? (thus re-capturing everyone's<br />  attention)...THEN, we can go right ahead doing our own solo stuff<br />  under the \\"guise\\" of The Eagles!!  We can still do our own thing -<br />  the only difference will be it will all be on the same album and<br />  we'll just call it...THE EAGLES!!<br /><br />Glenn:  MAN!...that sounds great!  Then maybe with the renewed interest<br />  that we'll generate by getting the band back together, we can go<br />  back to BUSINESSS AS USUAL with our solo careers!!<br /><br />Don:  Right on dude! We'll be back to being the CENTER OF THE<br />  UNIVERSE....which is where I REALLY want to be!!<br /><br />Glenn:  Yeah, ditto for ME!<br />  We've planned our work - now let's work our plan!!<br /><br />I really do love the Eagles and this album did get more likeable with repeated listening.  But it's clear the Eagles have turned into SWANS.<br /><br />This music is more mellow and urban -- less country and rock. But I suppose it's the best we're going to get so I should'nt complain. Alas,and sadly, the 70's are no more.  We'll just have to be brave and carry on.<br /><br />Oh,and Don?.. How about a little less criticism of the country and our leaders? Maybe instead you could bestow your \\"grand wisdom\\"  upon us all and give us answers as to what to do considering your strong grasp of the BIG PICTURE?  We would be so much more appreciative for SOLUTIONS to our problems as opposed to all the negative commentary.  Perhaps you and a few others in the music business should run for political office? Just a random thought since it appears you seem to have all the answers to the country and the world's woes and seeing as how you may be looking for a new career in the near future anyways.)<br /><br />Not to be a total jerk, I AM grateful for this new album.<br />You guys did'nt have to do it, but ya DID and we thank you!<br />I'll always love you guys....(even if we don't jive politically).

6305558167|2.0|What a sad disappointment! This film is one notch above a mediocre Kung-fu movie absent subtitles!<br /><br />I was astonished when I viewed this film -- I was expecting something \\"magical\\" (you know, since Merlin was involved and all!), but what I got was pure letdown. Please allow me to enumerate just some of  the ways in which this is a bad movie:<br /><br />1. The casting is awful. These people performed at the level of a student movie production, (actually, many students show much more enthusiasm than you'll see here!). None of the major characters, especially Merlin, King Arthur, and Guenevere are even adequately played. I expected the latter to be a regular man-melter (which are a-dime-a-dozen in the acting world) but she (Cherie Lunghi) was made up to look like some fuzzy-headed floozey.<br /><br />2. The storyline is incoherent (and I knew the story already!) -- the screenwriters must have either been on strike or perhaps really aggravated about something.<br /><br />3. The director must have thought he was producing a documentary and not a magical allegory fantasy film. I'm sad that they actually gave him film because videotape would have suited this flick better.<br /><br />4. The filmscore is Boring (yes, capital \\"B\\"), where it exists, but mostly, it doesn't exist at all. There is a poorly-rendered rip-off of segments of Carl Orff's (otherwise brilliant) \\"Carmina Burana\\" which is essentially twenty-four 13th century European poems put to music. It's like they only had enough budget to pay for 1/2 an original filmscore. They didn't even learn about how NOT to make the sound of the infamous \\"three-legged movie horse,\\" as individual knights gallop in, a semi-humorous caveat of old Roy Rogers and Gene Autry \\"B\\" westerns.<br /><br />5. The special effects are juvenile -- that's pretty much all I need to say on this, except that if you watch it, I hope you're crazy about green artificial lighting.<br /><br />6. The saddest ACTUALITY of this film: It COULD have been spectacular! Clearly, this was a high-budget, \\"A\\" film -- but no one got it right. It's as if everyone must have had a chip on their shoulder and wanted to sabotage the end product.<br /><br />I fought sleep to make it to the end of the movie, forcing myself to watch it to the very last in order to give the review a fair shake. Folks, if you peruse all my reviews, you'll see that I'm VERY liberal at awarding stars but I simply cannot do that here in good conscience. This is a cheesey version of a truly great legend and it's a darn shame that this is the case.<br /><br />Don't waste time or money on this mud-pumper.\\" film -- but no one got it right.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I find Blackout to be Britney's most catchy album. The songs just stick with you. Despite whats going on in her life, Ms. Spears has put out yet another great album. I was let down in the fact that she only wrote two of the tracks that are on Blackout. I had listened to a lot of leaks on the internet and she had wrote them and they were great [such as \\"State Of Grace\\", \\"Everybody\\", and \\"What U Sippin On?\\"].   The most catchy songs on this album for are \\"Gimme More\\" and \\"Radar\\". \\"Radar\\" especially. It's a really fun song. \\"Toy Soldier\\" is also another favorite, it deserves to be a single [as does \\"Radar\\"]. The two songs Brit-Brit wrote are titled \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\" and \\"Freakshow\\". I personally love both of those tracks. OOB is awesome very very catchy. \\"Freakshow\\" kinda sounds like a freakshow but its very Britney.  My personal favorite is \\"Heaven On Earth\\". This track is actually about love [and not sex such as the song right after, \\"Get Naked\\"] and is really quite sweet. It's so out of place though on this album.   There is only one song that I just never got used to and that is \\"Perfect Lover\\". It and \\"Get Naked\\" are, in my opinion, the weakest tracks.  The very last song, \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\", although great, lacks feeling.  Had Britney wrote the song herself I think it would had carried more emotion.  Overall, Britney has done it again and gave us some more great music. I have been a fan since the beginning and if I haven't given up on her now I don't think I ever will. It's clear she needs help, but she will only be helped if and when she wants to be. A person has to want to help themselves.
B000001GPX|5.0|What I could say about this album...excellent recording quallity performed by Deutsche Gramophon. Besides the recording quallity I could say...just Carlos Kleiber...Somehow he creates a magic atmosphere. It is like you are into the music itself. Buy these, you will be satisfied.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Wow. Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\" looks absolutely stunning in its Blu-ray presentation. Aside from Orson Welles' \\"Mr. Arkadin\\", there probably hasn't been a movie as fiddled with as \\"Blade Runner\\". This set features the 1) theatrical cut from 1982, 2) the \\"International Cut\\" which appeared on cable 3)the \\"Work Print\\" version which was premiered for a test audience and, aside from a showing at a film festival, hasn't been seen since 3)\\"The Director's Cut\\" which was created after the buzz from the \\"Work Print\\" showing and created by Scott with Terry Rawlings the original editor tweaking the film (by eliminating the narration, adding in a Unicorn dream sequence -borrowed outtakes from \\"Legend\\" when the original footage couldn't be found-and with the more uncertain ending. The the film was trimmed here and there as well) and 4)\\"The Final Cut\\" where Warner gave Scott, Rawlings and DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika the chance to go back and do fixes that Scott had always wanted to do such as digitally eliminating the cables lifting the Spinners, digitally eliminating crew members that were accidently seen in the edge of the frame, fixing continuity errors, backgrounds and tweaking the opening with the eye a bit.<br /><br />The result is a \\"Blade Runner\\" OCD fan's dream--every version of the movie plus a brilliant three hour documentary \\"Dangerous Days\\" (Hampton Fancher's original title for his screenplay of Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?)directed by de Lauzirika (who used to be an assistant at Scott's Scott Free Productions)featuring archival and new interviews with all the usual suspects. I'm not sure if this was isolated to my disc but the documentary would occasionally stop for no reason. It could be that the firmware on my unit needs to be updated but I thought I would bring this up if others have any problems with the set.<br /><br />The extras would take a day to run through. In the documentary we get a huge volume of deleted/alternate scenes, a pair of fascinating screen tests for the roles of Pris and Rachael (actors that were the first runners up for the roles), commentary tracks by author Paul Sammon (who wrote a series of terrific articles and a very good book on the film Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner), Scott, producer Michael Deeley, Production Executive Katherine Haber, Visual Futurist Syd Mead along with Visual Effects Supervisors Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich and writers Hampton Fancher & David Peoples (who pointedly state that they never intended Deckard to be a Replicant--Scott may feel that way in retrospect but I have always felt that it was much more metaphorical with Deckard becoming like a Replicant and rediscovering his humanity from Batty--something that adds power to the ending of the film. I suspect that Scott wasn't sure when he shot the film but has become convinced over the years that he did indeed intend that from the beginning).<br /><br />Packaged in a very nice, slim Blu-ray case with a booklet featuring stills from the film, \\"Blade Runner\\" finally gets the love that it deserves. Luckily for us it didn't take a Criterion or 50 years to allow the film to get the recognition and appreciation it deserved (only 25).

1400079276|5.0|This is the first Murakami book I read. It changed my life. I read The Wind Up Bird Chronicle immediately afterward, and both books for me completely transformed my vision of life and fiction and the possibilities for both. If I traced a path of imaginative fiction, starting probably with the miracle stories, to the twentieth century with Kafka, then García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, these two books by Murakami have reached farther out than any of them. Kafka was the inspiring luminary, so it's not surprising to me that his name happened to wind up in the title of this book. García Márquez talks about when he first read Kafka, how reading about a man who woke up a cockroach opened his imagination. I think Murakami has the same impact today. For that alone, he deserves the Nobel Prize. But also, Murakami has the ability to reach further into the subconscious and the relationships among human (and animal!) spirits than most other authors. I was disappointed in his last novel, After Dark, because he didn't seem committed enough to what he was writing to explore things to the end.  But he is my favorite writer, and I look forward to whatever he puts out next.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Like the other review on this movie, I have pre-ordered this movie and I can't wait to see and hear this movie in my own home.  Saw it at the show and it was a super movie, it's going to look great on my new Samsung 46\\" 1080 HDTV from my new SP3.
0440238609|4.0|After hearing all the hype from the christain doomsayers, I expected the book and story to be downright anti-christain. Sadly, it was not. Instead what I found was a well written, fast paced, science fiction/fantasy story. The characters are well developed, the story moves along well. The plots within plots is reminisent of Alistair McClean and his mystery western - Breakheart Pass. The only drawback that I can determine is the story revolves around a young girlchild.     I can fully recommend this to anyone that wants a nice good read.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" (2006) fits into the tiny sub-genre of recent \\"the tax-man needs love too\\" films, which includes \\"Exotica\\" (1994) and \\"Off the Map\\" (2003). And since nothing of real consequence happens in this moral tale of a film, you could make a case for it being like Eric Rohmer's \\"My Night With Maude\\" (insert sequences of serio-comic triviality here). Although I can see why some people compare it to \\"The Hours\\" (2002) it is really a variation on \\"Adaptation\\" (2002) and its various allegorical elements.     As in \\"Adaptation\\" you have a stalled character going to a literary professional for advice. Instead of troubled screenwriter Charlie Kaufman seeking advice from adaptation guru Robert McKee, you have IRS agent Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) contacting literature professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). Which serves as an excuse to utilize a vast store of insider jokes about screen writing/fiction writing.     Maggie Gyllenhaal was in both films. In \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" she plays Harold's love interest, Ana Pascal, the irreverent owner of a bakery. This is one of the all-time best film romances and it owes a lot Director Marc Forster's casting of these two actors. It's a quirky and sideways path to romance and is sold by Ferrell's trademark lack of guile and Gyllenhaal's way of teasing a role.     As in \\"Adaptation\\" the wrapped too tight hero might be schizophrenic; but instead of a fast living unpretentious twin brother, Harold hears a woman author's narration in his head; and she is narrating a highly accurate account of Harold's day-to-day existence. The voice is actually that of Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), a slightly suicidal author struggling with writer's block. Her prior books have all ended with the death of her main character (insert \\"The Hours\\" here) and she is struggling with just how to dispatch Harold in the book she is currently writing. Harold is clued to his ultimate fate when her narration uses the phrase \\"little did he know\\". Both Kay and Jules nicely display the dichotomy between the passion of their creativity and the reserve of their analysis and critique.    Once he knows his fate Harold begins making positive changes in his life style, which culminates in his romance with Ana. So you get the standard \\"stop and smell the roses\\" theme, a bit of a \\"free will vs destiny\\" theme, and finally the principal question: If the novel Kay is writing would be a masterpiece only if it ends in Harold's death, what right does he have continue his life? And the secondary question once Kay understands the implications of a tragic ending: Can she assume the responsibility of sacrificing another life as the necessary cost of producing a masterpiece?    The production design in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is nothing to get excited about but it does not distract from the story. There is some distraction by the effects people who periodically overlay cute little graphics to illustrate Harold compulsive need to count things and set things in order. But it is all in the service of  character development.     Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

0743298039|5.0|Dickensian in depth, scope and grandeur with the feminine overtones of Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\", staunchly upper crust British in its attitudes and values, Victorian in flavour and yet deliciously undated and entirely timeless, Diane Setterfield's \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a spectacularly modern gothic murder mystery that will thrill its readers from first page to last. Truly enjoyable literary fiction without the stuffiness or pretentiousness so typical of this genre!<br /><br />Vida Winters is a reclusive best selling novelist whose personal history has never been told. Actually, that's not quite right ... it has been told on numerous occasions! But it's never been the same story - nineteen journalists have had their chains yanked with nineteen thoroughly different stories, each of which was wilder and more patently false than the other eighteen! So when Margaret Lea, a little known biographer and the daughter of a quietly successful antiquarian book-seller received a letter from Ms Winters asking her to attend at her country estate to prepare her life story, Ms Lea had scant reason to believe that the famous author was actually prepared to tell her the truth!<br /><br />But the story was told and what a story it was - an astonishing mysterious tale of a dysfunctional wealthy family, twins, insanity, murder, ghosts, abandoned infants, incestuous love, arson and more. And conveyed by an author whose command of her craft is all the more surprising and compelling for its being a debut novel! Setterfield's masterful prose, to steal one of her own phrases, will wash over its readers in an explosion of \\"vertiginous, kaleidoscopic brilliance\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weiss
B000EOTAM6|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie.  It raised some interesting science fiction concepts, and has some very thrilling scenes (wait until you see the blades of grass -- emphasis on the word blade).  It has mixed critical reviews, so I put off watching it for a long time, but now I'm very glad I did.<br /><br />It reminded me of Gattaca, with some shades of Dark City thrown in.  So, if you liked those movies, you may like this as well.<br /><br />I have no idea how closely it fit with the Aeon Flux MTV cartoon, as I think I saw one (at most) of those many years ago.  But, as a standalone movie, I liked it!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have found the swivel sweeper to be an absolutely indispensible tool.  I don't use a standard vacuum or broom and dust pan any longer.  The Swivel Sweeper does everything that I need:  cleaning hardwood and tile floors (it doesn't work on carpets unless there is no nap).  There is nothing like it for cleaning up cat litter that gets out of the cat box.  I used to use a mini vac for this purpose, but Swivel Sweeper cleans effortlessly.    The 360-degree rotating head gets virtually anywhere.  The handle can be 90 degrees vertical to 0 degrees horizontal (e.g., for getting under beds effortlessly).  The sweeper gets right up to walls and even in corners.  It gets behind toilets and all the other places that a regular vacuum would be too big for.  The Swivel Sweeper is light and effortless.    Putting the Swivel Sweeper together out of the box is simplicity itself.  Snap a few parts into place and voila!  It takes about 60 seconds.  The rechargeable battery lasts almost an hour and recharges fully in about 8 hours with the supplied charger (not rechargeable batteries to buy).  You don't have to worry about finding outlets to plug into and dragging that inconvenient vacuum AC cord everywhere you go.    The Swivel Sweeper comes with a little tool that you can use to pick threads and such like out of the brushes if you need to.  In normal use, if you avoid carpets, you shouldn't even have to do this.  I would not recommend avoiding using the Swivel Sweeper on wet debris (like wet cat litter).  This can get on the brushes and cake things up.  As long as you keep to dry clean-up, you shouldn't have any problem at all.    I can't recommend this product highly enough.  There is just nothing like it for easily and quickly cleaning up on any surface except carpets.  It easily cleans in places that no vacuum would ever get to.    UPDATE.  I have found that the manufacturing of these swivel sweepers is unreliable.  I had one Swivel Sweeper, which worked fine for a couple of years.  Then the motor started cutting in and out.  I ordered another, and it suffered the same problem after two months.  Unfortunately, AsSeenOnTVGuys does not replace defective products after 15 days, so if you get a defective one, you will not be able to get a free replacement.    UPDATE.  I have purchased three of these swivel sweepers now.  The rechargeable battery seems to be a weak point.  I have had them lose power anywhere from a month to a year, after which the recharge works only for a couple of minutes.

I am a writer, you see. It is certainly no surprise to me that readers tell me they see similarities between my first novel and the one that told the story of my own childhood better than I ever could, the one that certainly influenced both my desire to write and the topics I choose to write about.<br /><br />Whenever I think that I might write a memoir of growing up in Alabama, I read this book again, and know that I don't need to. Miss Lee told my own story, those long, dusty summers filled with friends and playing outdoors, the neighborhoods where everyone knew all the children and generally, what they were doing, the lurid rumors and legends constructed of gossip and cautionary tales, secret pacts and promises, moss-covered trees hanging over slow muddy rivers, the far-off rumblings of trouble and upsets as the civil rights movement marched inexorably closer to us, and the quiet in which it finally came to face us. I remember the silence in which they marched, and I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird again, lying on my bed, windows open to non-existent breezes, wondering. Was Tom Robinson real? Did that really happen? What is happening now? Can I stop it? Can I do something? With all the restless yearning inside me, at ten years old, I reached for something, reading that book, lying on my back, staring at the ceiling, trying to see clearly what was coming.<br /><br />When I read this book, I remember Scout, the little girl who fought against change, who didn't quite understand the changes that happened despite her best efforts, and I see the girl that I was, straining to see, to understand. I wanted Scout to be my best friend, and you know what? She was. I have always liked books better than people. Some books are better friends than many people I know. Some books have helped me more, sustained me, taught me, kept me entertained, and led me closer to the person I want to be, than any person ever could.

And because it didn't follow the original story more closely, this is basically just another \\"28 Days Later\\" type of movie, albeit a good one.  But since so many of those types of movies have been out the past few years, this one doesn't stand out too much, again, because the original story wasn't adhered to.  A good film adaption (such as The Shining) take the essense of the written story and adapts to film; this one only got it partially.  I don't see myself rushing to see it again.

I read 'Helmet for my Pillow' by Robert Leckie as well.<br />Mr. Leckie's book is also very good but written with a lot of obscure words which made it a little harder to follow.  Perhaps just a sign of the times when his book was written as opposed to Mr. Sledge's book which was written in the early 1980's.<br /><br />Mr. Sledge's book, like Mr. Leckie's, does not use foul language, but Mr. Sledge's book spares no graphic detail otherwise.  Mr. Leckie's book usually refers to the horror of war but only gives a few graphic examples.<br /><br />Not that gore determines the quality of a book but it is easier to empathize with Mr. Sledge's daily existance.<br /><br />Also, after hearing Mr. Sledge speak and his southern drawl, I could visualize him speaking the words he wrote in his no nonsense approach.<br /><br />'With the Old Breed' is an excellent book and needs to be read by any WWII historian.

B000VDDDY6|4.0|We've all seen the episodes more times than we want to admit.  However, I simply had to see it in High Definition.  I spent my time scrutinizing the episodes for fine details that only HD can reveal.<br /><br />I enjoyed seeing coffee stains on the shirts and the complete obviousness of Spock's ear latex appliances and the correct hue of his facial make-up.  It was great to see Uhura's plastic earrings and the fine detail of all the phaser and communicator props and all the signs and read outs in freeze frame so I can actually read the text.  It was cool to see the helm of the bridge and all it's controls and be able to see that it was crudely fabricated and see polishing marks from rags and tiny defects.<br /><br />These tiny details are by no means a criticism.  It was a reason to watch all the episodes again to see just exactly what details I could spot.  I'm sure others will spot many more.  I was actually shocked that the Enterprise model looked so good and in all the detail of the planets while in orbit - but as others have pointed out, these special effects were re-done digitally.  And that is a shame.  I would have loved to see the real models and moldy oranges, i.e., planets that were in the original.  Maybe the HD transfer revealed too much and had to be removed -- but I would love to have seen it all anyway.  Wouldn't it have been a kick to actually be able to see a bunch of grapes with oblique lighting as the star field?  The digital enhancements alas took this away.<br /><br />I listened to the episodes with a nice set of Bose headphones and I have to say I liked the sound mix tremendously.  It was a very good stereo mix and I had to marvel at the care that went into it.  I did notice a few differences in effects and music, but it was not distracting at all and I'm sure the changes were a matter of necessity.  The changes simply ressurected old memories of watching the originals long ago.  I still remember the sound of those Talosian plants in the windfrom the first time I saw the show.  I knew for sure it was different here - but I had to remember from long ago to realize it.<br /><br />The transfer is not perfect in many places because the colors wash out and distort in several places - possibly this took place on the original source material.  These defects needed to be addressed in post-production.<br /><br />It's a high price to pay for this set, but I have to say the details are the best reason to buy this again and watch it again.  See how many little things you can spot.  It's amazing.  You might even want to re-read \\"The Making of Star Trek\\" by Stephen E. Whitfield before re-viewing the episodes in High Definition to fully appreciate the craftmanship and skill that went into Star Trek.
B00009NHC5|4.0|I remember watching this on television in the 1970's and it was one the scariest films of any genre I'd ever seen. Audrey Hepburn is superb in an Oscar nominated performance as a blind women terrorised by 3 men who are looking for a doll which contains drugs. Its tautly directed by Terence Young (who also directed the first two James Bond films 'Dr No' and 'From Russia with love'). The excellent music soundtrack is by Henry Mancini.<br /><br />As well as the usual trailers, the DVD has an interesting short extra called 'A Look in the Dark' in which Alan Arkin and the Producer Mel Ferrer (who was married to Audrey Hepburn) look back at the film. This is only about 10 minutes but its quite informative.<br /><br />However the main reason to buy the DVD is the film, and once it starts you will be hooked.

B000QQZHCY|5.0|I thought I'd never hear a group that was better than Queensryche.  I must not have looked that hard because in the last two days I found a couple bands that not only met, but surpassed my expectations.  These two groups are Kamelot and Sonata Arctica.      After listening to the clips from a few of the Amazon.com MP3 Kamelot album offerings, I decided upon the \\"Karma\\" album.  I was not at all disappointed in my selection.  To be honest, with Queensryche, I often had to listen to their new releases a few times to begin to appreciate them.  I liked the \\"Karma\\" material immediately (except for the french song).     Blazing tracks [in order of my preference] are \\"Wings of Despair\\", \\"The Spell\\", \\"Forever\\", \\"Karma\\", \\"Across the Highlands\\"    One that is more of a ballad style is \\"The Light I Shine On You\\" and at times it really rocks.    \\"Temples of Gold\\" is simply beautiful.  They even manage to get in a little lead guitar at the end.    \\"Elizabeth: I. Mirror Mirror\\" probably the slowest and darkest track picks up at 2:45.  Their vocalist shows his range.  At 3:15 you get some good lead work.    \\"Elizabeth: II. Requiem For The Innocent\\" also dark, is much faster paced with lots of guitar work.  You get piano and orchestra at 3:15.    \\"12. Elizabeth: III. Fall From Grace\\" starts out blazing and goes all over the place.  At 4:00 it starts to fade out... hmmmm. actually my MP3 seems to have about 7 minutes of dead silence at the end of this song.      \\"Ne Pleure Pas\\" (the french version of Don't you Cry).  It's about the only song that I may not truly appreciate yet.  Actually, it is not really that bad, but it's just acoustic guitar, some strings, and vocals.    From the other reviews I've read, \\"Karma\\" is not their best CD. I can't comment on that, but if that is true, I am really looking forward to delving into their other stuff.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|I say artist since Merle is indeed an icon not some single/45  maker typically known to this genre of music but a serious artist that is best served up on individual albums showing  his development or with the great box set \\"Down Every Road\\" that beautifully sums it all up and belongs in any serious CD collection.<br />The song selection here on HAG is a great mix and flows seamlesly and is enough to turn any rock fan into a country fan.<br />The sound is extraordinary as is the running time and liner notes and overall a great CD that included his famous duets with the great Johnny Cash(from the CASH CD Solitary Man),and the classic Willie Nelson cut Pancho and Lefty  as well as a newer track with Toby Keith spanning a trip down memory lane circa 1962- 2005..Interesting photos of Merle standing over a grave site within as a middle age man with additional shots of him younger and the elder statesmen which he now is, akin to 2006 when this great CD hit.
B000YENUI6|5.0|When a 14-year-old prostitute dies giving birth, midwife Anna faces a problem.  The mother left behind a diary, which Anna's uncle begins to translate.  It spins the tale of a lost girl, caught up in the Russian mafia, fed tales of glandour and eventually taken advantage of.  Anna has unkowningly immersed herself into a world of trafficking, rape, and murder; and her new acquaintance, Nikolai, embodies the worst of all of those.<br /><br />I've made the plot to be a bit melodramatic; although, to be honest, it is.  Who really cares, though?  I don't.  I started \\"Eastern Promises\\" expecting a good piece of entertainment, along the lines of its Cronenberg/Mortensen predecessor, \\"A History of Violence.\\"  An hour and a half later (the time having flown by), I was amazed.  I got what I expected, and much more.<br /><br />A lot has been said of Cronenberg's directing; I won't go into that too much.  If by now you aren't familiar with David Cronenberg, then I can't help you.  I'm going to focus on the acting, because that's what drew me in.  Naomi Watts is quickly becoming one of my favorite talents; she can convey so much emotion with the utterance of a single word.  Armin Mueller-Stahl is a scene-stealer as always; his understated mob boss performance is not only believable, it's downright chilling.  Vincent Cassell is simply delightful as he hops from one scene to the next; you can't tell whether to fear him or pity him.<br /><br />The real reason you're gonna watch this movie, however, and let's all be honest here, is for Viggo Mortensen's performance as Nikolai.  He is chilling; he is downright terrifying.  I can see why he's nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor; if he doesn't get it, it will be a downright shame (though Mortensen, a truly gifted performer who seems to take his art rather seriously, probably won't shed any tears over the loss).  The fight scene in the steam room will go down as a cinema classic; perfectly choreographed, perfectly acted.  You see a bit more of Mortensen than you really want to--well, ladies, maybe you have a different opinion--but it's all for the sake of art.<br /><br />And that's what \\"Eastern Promises\\" is, after all--art.  Cronenberg, in my opinion, is one of the most artful directors out there today.  He perfectly navigates the cannal between a study of violence and an explotation of it.  \\"Eastern Promises\\" is definitely a study of violence; there are questions raised that get unanswered, but it's not Cronenberg's job to answer them.  He's just a director.  You, the audience, must decide the answers for yourself.  So don't watch this movie, or any Cronenberg movie, unless you're willing to do some thinking.  But we'll forgive you if, for an hour and a half, you just sit back and enjoy the show.you really want to--well, ladies, maybe you have a different opinion--but it's all for the sake of art.

B0002TX4QQ|4.0|Lionel Shriver's seventh (published) novel is compelling and dark, a psychological study of a difficult subject that is almost perfectly composed. I will leave it to other reviewers to explain the novel's successes, which are many. The taboo surrounding the idea of raising an unwanted child, the questions attending the idea of innate evil, the painful issues connected to mass murders -- Shriver deals with all of them brilliantly. But half-way through the writer tips off the reader as to the \\"surprise\\" waiting at the end, which I found disappointing in writing of this caliber. I can't and won't tell you the tip-off or the conclusion since it would violate all the ethical rules of review, but you'll see. Still well worth the reading, and sure to provoke profound reflection.
0743243153|1.0|I first read this book in 2000.  And I thought my own problems with this book might just be my problems projected on to the book.  Or those justifiable with impeccable reasonings were just minor problems, the criticizing of which would keep me from seeing the main issues and value of Peck's writing.    I'm no expert in biology nor in thermodynamics.  I am not a medical doctor (like Peck) nor a famous author (like Peck).  Despite these facts, I believe that Peck can be dismissed because he makes the argument in this book that life--human and otherwise--overcomes the second law of thermodynamics (energy, though conserved, always moves to lower state of usefulness).      My faith now and then is that the Sun currently provides a vast and long-lasting source of useful energy.  My belief of this is unshakeable.  I believe that life does not place energy in anymore of a useful state than a silicon-based microprocessing unit.  Nevertheless, Peck argues that Life does disprove the second law of thermodynamics.  A minor point, but one that after 7 years of consideration was good a one to dismiss this stupid narcissistic pop-fool.      He claims to use the scientific method, yet on very basic perceptions I believe he gets it totally wrong.  When I just think about most of the ideas covered in this pop spiritual book that have less tangible aspects with reality.  I now believe with good reason and my own unshakeable faith that those too are just as ill-conceived as his notion of life overcoming the 2nd law of thermo.
B000IYV1ME|4.0|Some may call this movie a Hollywood Liberal fest that makes American Government look corrupt.  I see it as much more.  The movie shines much more true with all the events that have occurred in the past several months.<br /><br />Syriana stars an all star cast of many great actors.  They all come together to tell a story of how America is working hard to keep our oil secure and in our best interests.  Whether you like the fact that oil is a big part of our lively hood it is a reality.  The story is divided into many parts that eventually come together in some way or another.<br /><br />Two oil companies are merging together in hopes of controlling more of the industry.  Working to destabilize Iran enough to hopefully get control of their oil stakes.  This is a multi billion dollar business.  This sounds all to familiar to people who watch the news.  The movie then works to bleed all the stories together thru a complex web.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great story that is not action filled and will keep you thinking Syriana is a must see.  The movie doesn't pull any punches.  In many ways it is sad and scary.  This movie doesn't offer any sure fire cures for future ills but hopefully with the message people will listen and take some action.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These were recommended to me after I gave a mixed review to the Sony MDR-V600s.  I've never been as impressed by my V-600's as the Sony MDR-V6 phones that I lost.  The earlier pair seemed trimmer, lighter, with a \\"cleaner\\" sound--no gratuitous boosting of the bass.  My impression is that, although still being sold, Sony's support for the MDR-V6 is minimal and that their closest equivalent is the MDR-7506, not the V600s.  The 7506's sound less bass heavy and feel less constricting than either the V600s or MDR-V700's.  In fact, the specs indicate an even lighter weight and a shorter cord (best for radio announcing) than the MDR-V6 phones.  And it doesn't hurt that they're available through Amazon Prime--which is not the case with MDR-V6's.  It looks like my confidence in the pair was contagious--it's now practically the only set of headphones we use at our NPR radio station.<br /><br />Don't be surprised if upon first listening to these you're unimpressed.  And be even less surprised if upon exchanging the 7506's for a pair of V600's or V700's your initial reaction is one of satisfaction, even momentary exuberance.  The bass is far more prominent, the sound is fuller, fatter, more engulfing--the overall effect is simply \\"heightened.\\"  Stay with them for at least 15 minutes, now go back to the 7506's--and don't be too surprised if you completely revaluate your initial impression.  That's all it took for me to realize that Oscar Peterson's keyboard facility was not being accurately represented by the colorful sound of the V600's and V700's.  All of those 32nd and 64th notes in the right hand were overly reverberant and \\"doctored\\" relevant to the 7506's, causing the piano notes not only to sound overly brilliant but to \\"bleed\\" into one another.  Returning to the 7506's was like rediscovering \\"reality\\" and deciding that maybe \\"virtual reality\\" isn't all it's cracked up to be by today's gamers, audiophiles, and surround-sounders.<br /><br />Heavy bass attracts my interest only when you're talking a 4-6 pound largemouth.only when you're talking a 4-6 pound largemouth.
B00030590I|5.0|I loved this movie!  The ending really got to me.  I mean it really got to me.  It was visually stunning and the story really had something to say.  In an earlier review of another movie I spent most of the review lamenting the indiscriminate use of violence in movies for no reason at all.  This movie is violent but not gory and most importantly the violence in this movie has a reason for being!!      I watched this movie based on some friends recommendations and I am sure glad I did.  This is one of the few movies that has actually stuck with me in the past few years!!    And as always with a movie like this watch it with sub-titles!  Do not go for the bad English overdubbing(if there even is a version like that)
B000WCBMA8|3.0|The three years since the last Hives album has been rough on garage rock: The Strokes are AWOL, the Vines flamed out and the White Stripes embraced Led Zeppelin. The brightest new hopes, Black Lips, are best known for (literally) pissing on their fans. When the Hives collaborated on a Timbaland single and recruited fellow hip-hop producer Pharrell, it seemed like a provocative makeover was at hand. But even the title of their new CD is vintage Hives: It's a cheeky attempt to one-up Metallica and the Beatles. Most of the album, like the single \\"Tick Tick Boom,\\" sticks to formula: glam, pogo-ing blasts that aren't quite as catchy as \\"Main Offender,\\" their 2002 mini-hit. The second half draws on their Devo worship -- \\"T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S.,\\" manned by Pharrell, is robo-funk -- but often leaves them sounding unrecognizable or annoying. \\"Well All Right!\\" offers an apt metaphor: \\"swim across the ocean in a concrete suit.\\"
038533348X|5.0|\\"What can a thoughtful man hope for mankind on Earth, given the experience of the past million years? Nothing.\\"    Having just finished reading and loving [[ASIN:0385333846 Slaughterhouse-Five]], I wanted to move on to other Vonnegut works. I picked up Cat's Cradle a couple days later, and couldn't put it down. I was hooked from the beginning. I didn't find this book nearly as witty as Slaughterhouse Five, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's an engaging look at the ultimate futility of mankind to make the right choices at the right times. The story is also filled with themes and morals for the reader to discover (e.g. ice-nine was created to put an end to mud, and the Bokononist cosmogony says God created man from mud).    I'm not sure which I liked better, this or Slaughterhouse Five; the only thing that I know for sure is that I will be getting another Vonnegut book as soon as possible.
0786852550|5.0|I originally checked this book out from my local library as something to fill that empty spot while awaiting Harry Potter 5.  When the second and third books came out and our library chose not to buy the books I was a little disapointed.  I found the second book on sale from a library in Memphis and decided to buy it, and was very glad I did so.  I really liked the first book, Bartimaeus made it a real page turner, but fell in love with it on the second read.  Nathaniel is no Harry Potter in this book, his primary desire is to seek revenge on an adult magician who humilated him (such a bad boy!!). But just wait this story has more twists and turns than you can imagine, and that's just the beginning of why this is a great book for anyone who loves this genre.  Be warned that the story builds piece by piece from page one of the first book to the last page of book three. I found myself continually looking back to passages from this book to solve clues in the next two books, especially the third.  This book is also very different from Harry Potter in that Nathaniel and Bartimaeus at first look are not someone you would bring home to your parents, and especially not somone you would want your kids to be around. Nevertheless both have a central core of goodness that keeps peeking through and makes you root for them to succeed. If you have Harry Potter in your library I encourage you to get this series, it still is a story of good vs evil and of good triumphing over evil, but with a very different approach (can't tell more without spoiling the story).  Get it you won't be disappointed.
B000M341QE|1.0|The acting in this movie was great!  Especially Alec Baldwin and Leonardo Dicaprio!  I do think Jack Nicholson has gone to the well one too many times with the whole loose cannon thing.  I like him better in quieter roles where he actually gets to act, such as \\"The Pledge\\", and \\"As Good As It Gets\\".  He was TERRIFIC in both of those movies.    Back to \\"The Departed\\".  This isn't a badly done movie but after it was over all I could think of was \\"Why did I just watch this?\\"  Was I entertained?  With that much violence, I sure hope not.  Did the movie make me think of anything new or feel anything new?  NAH.  It was just violence.  It seems like a lot more movies are just that; violence!    I am not against violence in a movie when it does something or moves the story or even makes a point about something, but this was just violence.    This is just my opinion but it is something I have been thinking a lot about lately.
B000WCDI5K|3.0|Brandon Flowers is quite a shape-shifter. On his band's debut, he was a strobe-lit, synth-pop drama queen; second time out he became a would-be guitar-rock messiah, complete with bolo tie and facial-scruff gravitas. Now, on this collection of 17 cutouts, he appears as a shadow-draped brooder, keening over the noisiest, grimmest music his band has ever made. It's his least exciting role yet, although not without charms. Here he is anguishing about \\"Bushes and bombs\\" with Lou Reed (\\"Tranquilize\\"); here he is doing his best Ian Curtis (the spry Joy Division cover \\"Shadowplay\\"); a big fat sing-along springs up on \\"Under the Gun\\"--only it goes \\"Kill me now kill me now kill me now!\\" It's easy to see why these songs didn't fit on their record but, while a full listen turns unrelentingly dour, they're better than discards have any right to be.
B00006RINF|5.0|I begame a Lacuna Coil fan about 6 months ago at the age of 43...  I came across one of their videos while searching for something else, and have purchased nothing but Lacuna Coil music since.  I now think I own everything they've ever put out and Comalies is my favorite.  I think it most captures the essence of this band.  I have come to the conclusion that the one biggest factor that makes this band great is that they really care about the quality of the product (song) they deliver.  It's not about any one person in the band standing out, though Cristina Scabbia's vocals certainly rival those of any leading rock vocalist for as long as there has been rock music.  The members of this band simply come together to each add their talents to the final product, which is always outstanding.  There's a lot of soul here...  Anything by this band is above average, and I look forward to their future work as well.
B000WO251Q|4.0|I have read numerous Nicholas Sparks books, but had avoided this one because of the title.  The premise of a \\"Dear John\\" letter seemed so depressing.  But, recently I needed something to read one afternoon, and came upon the book once again.  I finished the book in several hours, and enjoyed it very much.  The plot was timely for our times and revealed the very best in the book's characters.
B000VAPZM2|1.0|I really enjoyed HSM1 and play the CD weekly. The songs are great, catchy, and have a good message. The story line in HSM2 is very lacking and is pretty much a remake of the late years of \\"Saved by the Bell.\\"  The songs are not catchy and are not memorable. The story line writers and song writers must be different than HSM1. And as others mention, it is all about the relationship between Troy and Gabriella. And Sharpay is too over the top mean spirited. This movie lost all the innocence of the first. I am disappointed in Disney, I know they can do better.
B000RJO578|3.0|A policeman strides down a precinct corridor. He's got the steely glare of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, the square-jaw intensity of Bruce Willis's John McClane and the maverick streak of Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs. We've seen enough blockbusters that even before our hero's name is uttered--they call him ... Nicholas Angel!--we know we're dealing with a law-enforcement lone wolf. Angel is the most dedicated member of London's Metropolitan Police. In fact, with an arrest rate \\"400 percent higher\\" than the rest of his department, he's making everybody else look bad, which is why this supercop just got shuffled off to a quaint English village where a high-speed pursuit means chasing a runaway pet swan.<br /><br />Welcome to Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz, which aims to do for high-octane action movies what his parodic masterpiece Shaun of the Dead did for zombie flicks. The setup is so simple even a studio executive would get it: Angel (Shaun star and cowriter Simon Pegg, who also shares writing duties here) is stuck in a town full of rural stereotypes (a kindly clergyman, cheery innkeepers) and saddled with a dim-bulb constable (Nick Frost) for a sidekick. Then a lot of mysterious \\"accidents\\" start occurring, and our hero smells a murder spree. (Things end up not being what they seem.) Oversize and extremely phallic guns are drawn. Things go boom. And, amid all the laughter, '80s he-man cinema gets slowly roasted over a spit.<br /><br />Any half-wit can parody a genre or two--or a dozen; just ask the cretins behind cut-rate gagfests like Epic Movie. But what makes Wright & Co.'s buddy-cop goof so spot-on is that, like their previous take on splatter flicks, the pair share an affection for--and thorough knowledge of--cineplex cheese with their film-geek fan base. It's one thing to give the local homicide detective an outrageously bushy mustache (though, to be fair, actor Paddy Considine's upper-lip shrubbery deserves some sort of tonsorial award); it's another thing entirely to treat flash-cut montages of doors being opened and pub pints being pulled as if they were action sequences, or to turn a supermarket siege into a spot-on homage to John Woo's bullet ballets. The fact that all of this Sturm und Drang is taking place in a picturesque hamlet only makes the inherent silliness of law-and-order summer-movie spectacles more apparent.<br /><br />And yet, because Wright and Pegg still harbor a soft spot for Riggs and Murtaugh et al, they take the piss out of them without being condescending. The sheer glee with which they present these high-testosterone misadventures seems to say that yes, guys jumping over car hoods while firing two Glocks at once is so over the top that you can't take it seriously. But we still get a huge rush watching.<br /><br />Those viewers who prefer their testosterone in kinder, gentler doses may want to check out Diggers, a pleasant-enough indie about immature dudes belatedly coming of age. In this case, it's a bunch of Long Island clam fishermen figuring things out in the mid-'70s (which means plentiful sideburns). But the character types are essentially timeless: There's the go-with-the-flow guy (Paul Rudd), who gets an existential wakeup call when his pop dies; the local Lothario (Ron Eldard); the stoner philosopher (Josh Hamilton); and the blue-collar a-hole­ (The State's Ken Marino). Various women, naturally, orbit these overgrown boys of summer as they stand around and talk. And talk. And talk. Director Katherine Dieckmann keeps everything moving smoothly, and the appeal of Rudd in wisecracking mode can't be underestimated. But if you've ever sat through an Ed Burns film, there's nothing here you haven't seen before.<br /><br />That's something that certainly can't be said for Zoo, a documentary about a Seattle resident who in the summer of 2005 went to see a man about a horse. He ended up bleeding to death in an emergency room several hours later from a perforated colon, and filmmaker Robinson Devor (Police Beat) traces the link between the two events. Yes, unfortunately, it's exactly what you think--the victim was visiting a farm that catered to hot man-on-stallion action. A former crime reporter, Devor is skilled at getting people involved in the underground \\"zoophile\\" community to open up about their unusual lifestyle. What's most surprising, however, is how he's able to make a film about such a sensationalistic subject and have it be neither unbearably sleazy nor cringe-inducing. Thanks to the dreamlike cinematography and ambient soundtrack, the movie feels like a lyrical meditation on twisted desires (though it doesn't condone them). As good as it is, this is one movie you hope to God never gets a sequel.events.

0307387151|2.0|Writers of a certain kind are certain to be Booker nominated. Readers, if they care about writing, approach these works either with reverence or skepticism.<br />With these premises in mind, I took up ATONEMENT wanting to be dazzled by the entire reading experience. I wasn't.<br />Precious and pretentious are words that other reviewers have used about this book, unless they were reverential about the source. Those are the words I would use. McEwan is in love with the sound of his own voice.<br />Offered for your consideration is the following nine-line sentence from early in the book (oh yes, it parses--but so what?):<br />\\"Like re-armament and the Abyssinia Question and gardening, it was simply not a subject when, after a long Saturday morning wait, Briony heard at last the sound of wheels on the gravel below her bedroom window, and snatched up her pages and ran down the stairs, across the hallway and out into the blinding light of midday, it was not insensitivity so much as a highly focused artistic ambition that caused her to shout to the dazed young visitors huddled together by the trap with their luggage, 'I've got your parts, all written out. First performance tomorrow! Rehearsals start in five minutes'.\\"<br />This is excruciating to read. It's sloppy writing and not what one should expect from a highly praised literary giant. Reading this book is like slogging through mud in waders--exhausting.<br />The great film writer William ('Butch Cassidy') Goldman once said that the key to good screenplay construction is to move forward into the action as far and as fast as possible. These days, with the complexity of life and the many high-priority demands on our time, the same criterion must be applied to book writing, or any writing. Literary self-indulgence (that's the polite form of 'pleasuring') is a luxury most writers do not enjoy, but we should not tolerate from any writer, no matter how highly praised--whether deserved or not.<br />Meantime, McEwan can laugh, reliably, all the way to the bank.e bank.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I'm always skeptical when a studio promises an \\"improved\\" version of a personal favorite, since so many directors just don't know when to leave well enough alone.  To be quite honest, I wasn't too pleased with Ridley Scott's re-release of \\"Legend\\", so I had very guarded expectations coming into this purchase.<br /><br />Without a doubt, \\"Blade Runner\\" is a cinematic high water mark -a resplendent, existential masterpiece drenched with subtlety and visual power.  I can honestly say that this film influenced my childhood more than any other -from the grim, dystopian future it forebodes, to the haunting and utterly unique Vangelis score.  With today's directors offering nothing but disposable summer blockbusters and CGI-soaked explosion-fests, this may very well be the last film of its kind.  So you can get a sense of my apprehension when I heard Ridley was finally going to release a cleaned-up special edition DVD.<br /><br />Ridley, I'm sorry I doubted you.<br /><br />The accompanying 3.5 hour documentary is unmatched for thoroughness and detail (save, perhaps for The LOTR trilogy SE releases -which, frankly wore thin after about the sixth hour of behind-the-sccenes coverage).  The documentary ALONE is worth the price of the set.<br /><br />The film itself is indeed beautifully and flawlessly restored.  The promised \\"extended footage\\" and \\"never-before-seen visual effects\\" are subtly and expertly grafted into the film in a way that no other \\"improved\\" DVD has ever accomplished.  This time the tweaks are both respectful to fans' expectations and WELCOME.  If you've grown up hoping they'd do something about the occasional unfortunate matte painting/film color mismatch, or the handful of continuity errors in the last \\"Director's Cut\\", you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />I spotted at least one change in the ending that finally resolves what many fans consider one of the film's more egregious missteps, and a reversion to the original intent of Batty's dialogue with Tyrell that (for me, at least) works every bit as well as the one we've been watching for the last twenty years.<br /><br />About the only thing they didn't address in the supplemental disc (I've not yet watched the film with the commentaries, so this may be premature) is why it took so long to release this.  As any Blade Runner fan knows, the DVD release has been mired in controversy and speculation about legal battles for over a decade, yet no mention was made of \\"why now?\\"<br /><br />In any case, what difference does it make?  It's finally here.  And it is every bit worth the wait.bit as well as the one we've been watching for the last twenty years.

B000TGJ8F8|5.0|Didn't last long in theatres and I wasn't expecting that much from the movie based on reviews that I had seen, but this is a nice, taut, action thriller.<br /><br />It looks very sharp on HD DVD and features some beautiful images from the Grand Canyon area, and oh, yeah, by the way features some pretty beautiful images of the tight Ms. Jessica Biel, along with a no-nonsense, take charge Federal Agent played by Julianne Moore.  Nicholas Cage does a great job as a small time magician that actually has a big time power -- the ability to look into the future, his future, to see what lies ahead.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, and the action rarely slows, but there are a few breath-taking scenes that do add in some of the most beautiful scenery that could ever be filmed.  Well worth adding to your video collection :-)
0007158521|5.0|One of the many benefits of teaching young children is you have constant opportunities to stumble across picture book gems, that would surely surpass you, unless of course you have children.<br /><br />OH, THE PLACES YOU\\"LL GO! Is a charming book. The afternoon I read it too a bunch of 7 year olds, I was at the bookstore hunting down a copy.<br /><br />I then read it to a 38 year old man. He loved it. Oh the places you'll go is a whimsical look into the journey of being human. Although for children, I think this book is an inspirational, everything-is going to be okay story.<br /><br />I think it would make an excellent University graduation present or a nice pick-me-up gift for a much loved friend or family member going through a bit of a slump.<br /><br />\\"On and on you will hike.<br />And I know you'll hike far<br />And face up to your problems<br />Whatever they are..\\"<br /><br />I also love THE WAITING place that Dr.Seuss talks about in this book.<br /><br />I usually feel that Dr. Suess books are perhaps just ¼ too long, I didn't feel that in this case.<br /><br />This is a lovely book. Every child and adult should get themselves a copy.<br /><br />Go Dr. Seuss!
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Described a few days ago by a public radio announcer as being a \\"box office flop\\" when it was released in 1982, this movie nevertheless has had a huge following since that time. Some have considered the movie as a warning against dangerous technological influences, while others, a small minority in fact; consider it a tour de force, as an indication of where technology is headed. If one examines the evidence carefully, there are strong indications that advances in genetic engineering and neuroscience will allow the kinds of beings portrayed in this film to be produced in the near future. These beings, called \\"replicants\\" in the movie, have mental and physical abilities that are enhanced to a large degree over the humans that surround them. These abilities were designed into them by their creators, with the hopes of using them to perform dangerous physical labor on the \\"off-world\\" colonies. All of the actors who portray the replicants in the movie give convincing performances, especially when displaying their emotional immaturity and their reaction to fear. In the latter, they are behaving like any ordinary human would: protecting themselves against forces that seek to destroy them.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is interesting, and for a technophile it is an excellent vehicle with which to project oneself into a future that he may not get to experience. Indeed, there is so much to contemplate while viewing it: advanced space travel, flying cars, sophisticated toy robots, voice recognizing machines, the artificial owl and snake, and of course the advances in genetic engineering. But whether put in by the director on purpose or not, there are a few things in the movie that point to the limitations of scientific understanding at the time (2019). For example, the toy-maker J.F. Sebastian complains about having \\"Methuselah syndrome\\", which as he explains it is a form of accelerated aging, which prevents him from living in the off-world colonies. Medical science is apparently still not advanced enough to cure him of this illness. Another example is when Roy Batty challenges Eldon Tyrell to extend his lifetime to one that is greater than four years, but Tyrell gives Batty the biological reasons why this cannot be done. So even though genetic engineering is advanced enough to create functioning replicants, it is still unable to \\"alter the coding sequence once it has been set\\". These two examples exemplify the idea that there are always issues, problems, and areas that science has not yet explained, thus motivating further research.<br /><br />The replicants Zhora and Pris are both sexually enticing figures in the movie, and of course this was by design. But they cannot compare to the desirability of Rachel, a special replicant designed by Tyrell and who totally overwhelms all the other characters in movie. Her fragility and naivet&eacute; are to be contrasted with her sophistication in dress and demeanor. Every set she is in becomes her runway, but the best scene is when she first meets Rick Deckard, and asks him about the artificial owl. Her clothes, makeup, and hairstyle are pure twenty-first century, and naturally Deckard is very attracted to her, as any man would be. And in this regard it does not matter whether Rachel is a replicant or not. All that matters for an attraction to take place is the responses in the brains of both parties. This movie gives a glimpse of the love affairs between humans and machines that will be a common occurrence in this century, and there is no rational or ethical reason why they should not take place.<br /><br />And far from being evil, the Tyrell Corporation exemplifies the kind of future that is ahead. No doubt corporations in this century will cause some difficult social problems, and technological advances of course have their negative ramifications (the \\"acid rain\\" and filthy streets in the movie), but these can be cured by new technology. Thus one technological advance requires another, and this one still another. Each advance seems to occur much more rapidly than the other, forcing an unrelenting march into the future. Sometimes this march can be as a drunkards walk, and sometimes it takes place with huge leaps, but as this movie and those it influenced after it was released portrays, there are always consequences, sometimes negative and sometimes positive. But far from being a dystopian vision of the future, this movie portrays one that all humans should strive for. And in the process of doing so, we will be assisted by the very technology we create. This technology will also develop its own vision of the future, and it might be very different from our own.r.

B00005JPNW|5.0|\\"Golden Compass'\\" storyline is one that's a well-known favorite for fantasy readers.  It's both an adventure-quest and a coming of age tale for a young orphan. What makes the movie such a standout is the execution of the story both visually and sonically.    \\"Golden Compass\\" world is made up of a variety of life forms. Humans all have daemon bonded to them.  Daemons shapeshift at will while the child's soul is still developing and at some point in their maturity take a fixed animal shape. Witches have the gift of magic, plus the daemons bound to them do not have to remain as close as those bound to mere humans. Ice bears (polar bears) are one of the fiercest and strongest of the peoples and armored ones are often hired as bodyguards.      In the beginning, orphaned Lyra Belacqua (Dakota Blue Richards) has no knowledge of her true parentage. She and her daemon, Pan, are currently the ward of her uncle, Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig). She attends a boarding school, Jordan College.     The story opens with Lord Asriel returning to Jordan College to advise the administration that he's found 'dust' in the Northern Country. 'Dust'is the constituent material of parallel worlds and Asriel believes he can travel between the worlds.  He's asking the College to fund his research.     The Magisterium is a body that's attempting to regulate the world's magical gifts and keep them under control Their representative at the College opposes this research and tries to convince the academics not to sponsor it.  Failing at that, he poisons the wine Lord Asriel was to drink at his presentation.  Fortunately, Lyra was spying and she warned her Uncle before he could take that fateful sip.    The college agrees to sponsor Lord Asriel's research and he's setting about on another mission to the North. Lyra asks to come, but he will not permit it. She is to remain safe at school. Needless to say, this edict doesn't sit well with the strong minded young woman.        After Asriel has departed, Lyra is given the Alethiometer, a Golden Compass, which tells the truth--as long as the person using it knows how to both frame the questions posed and read the answers from the symbols around the compass'outer ring. She's told to keep the device a secret. At one time there were several such devices.  The Magisterium has them all now.      Enter the lovely Mrs. Coulter (Nicole Kidman), who Lyra first meets at a Jordan College dinner. Mrs. C. takes an immediate fancy to Lyra and offers her a chance to come along with her on a trip to the North to see the Ice Bears. Despite misgivings, the Headmaster releases Lyra into Mrs. C's care.     Lyra quickly learns she has no freedom in Mrs. Coulter's house.  Worse, the Compass keeps displaying GOB, GOB, GOB....Almost too late, Lyra realizes that Mrs. Coulter is one of the Magisterium and a Gobbler to boot--the Gobblers are people who are kidnapping children, who are never seen again.     Lyra and Pan escape. They're helped by a band of Gyptians (wanderers) who get them to Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliot) who is willing to help her if she can get his ship out of hock and help his friend Iorek Byrnison (voice: Ian McKellen) armored ice bear.     The rest of the story is for you to see, but it's very worth the price and the lines at the theatres this time of year.      \\"Compass\\" is one of the most beautifully filmed fantasies since LOTR.  The cast was very well chosen.  I was impressed with Ms. Blue's debut and am hoping to see her in future films.  Voice-overs were perfect for their respective characters and the music was also lovely.      I would not want to miss this show at the theaters.  I've got this one on my wish list for the time when it comes out on DVD.  I am certain I will want to see \\"Golden Compass\\" again.
B0009UC7TS|5.0|\\"He's getting away with the WMDs!\\"<br /><br />Oh this movie is far from politically correct (as with just about all of the Parker and Stone creations) but it is outrageously funny and entertaining.<br /><br />While I had been avoiding buying things in the UMD format initially, the release of the Slimline PSP with it's ability to output to TV via the add-on cable had me going back and buying some favorites for viewing on the PSP with the thought being that I could at least watch the same movies on the bigger screen if I desired.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that I'll get in just about every available format as I can't help but watch it when I catch it on the TV and then get irritated by how censored the movie is and how badly it's chopped up for insertion of commercials and such.  At that point I pull out the appropriate format disc and watch my own uncensored copy.<br /><br />This one is for you Kim Jong... ;-)

B000RZIGZ4|5.0|Oh the testosterone that flows throughout this movie.  This movie could have been used as a recruiting film for the U.S. Navy when it was released.  Everyone that saw it likely wanted to be a Naval aviator.<br /><br />The video here does 'pop' nicely, and in many ways this is a great movie to use as a reference type disc (one to show off HD features).  The master that was used is not perfectly clean, but it is still in excellent condition and the movie looks great for it.<br /><br />The soundtrack still gets my pulse pounding and I can and do sit intently watching this movie dedicating 100% of my attention to the film through large parts (not something I always do as I tend to multitask a lot and am easily distracted when a movie isn't holding my attention).<br /><br />Anthony Edwards back when he hair, Meg Ryan before she became a star, Kelly McGillis looking quite tantalizing, and Tom Cruise well before the jumping on the couch stage of his career.  Not to mention Tom Skerrit, Val Kilmer and others including an easily lost Tim Robbins appearing for just a brief instant.<br /><br />Like others, I hope for a special edition version in the future.  Something that adds some (considering there are really none here) special features.  In the meantime, the film is still great fun and the video is just so impressive I can't downgrade it at all.  Yes, fly me to the danger zone!  (Please :-) )
1401300529|4.0|This book covers approximately the first nine months of the Korean War.  It deals with many elements surrounding the war, including historical context, geography, major actors, geopolitical currents, interpersonal relations among the several high ranking people involved, etc.  This is less about the battles themselves, and more about why the battles were fought where, when, and how.  In particular, the battle around the Chosin Reservoir is something he builds up to, but doesn't actually cover.  How the Korean War was connected to the previous several wars that affected the general area, and how it affected later wars (specifically the Vietnam War) are also covered.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|It's a great collection, complete with DVD videos. But there is another album with this title containing more music and videos. There seems to be two versions of this album at this time with the same Title and Artist.  The plan as I understand it is the album is a work in process of constant development.  Eventually slated to contain 34 tracks + bonus DVD.  Still it is good music at a good price.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love this movie! While it does follow along with the general storyline of Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" it has that wonderful Muppet humor and great songs! I find it impossible to be sad when I'm listening to Kermit sing, \\"One Last Sleep to Christmas.\\" I recommend this to all children (or young-at-heart)!
B000OHZL1W|4.0|I saw this movie when it was originally released and was enthralled by it.  The technology, at that time, was somewhat cutting edge, gee whiz type stuff.  It's been many years since that original viewing, but seeing the movie in HD brought back memories.<br /><br />Some of the equipment (acoustic coupler anyone?) is so dated now, but some of it still would be considered hi-tech even today. Perhaps the biggest thing 'dating' the movie is the amount of money tossed around as the dollar amounts would be laughable by today's standards, and should be laughable by even the standards from when the movie was made (1991), but that was quite some time ago.<br /><br />There were also many different stars crammed into this movie, including the President from the reimagined BSG (Battlestar Galactica) showing up in a supporting role.<br /><br />My only real complaint about the film now is the inherent political message that comes through.  Not just anti-establishment...
B000001ESF|4.0|If you like energetic prog rock music and great musical performance, you should give this cd a try, you won't regret.  Canada's best band, without a doubt !

B000VWYJ8Q|5.0|First off.  I love this movie.  The Bourne series is one of the best out there (better than 007).  Matt Damon does a great job.  The HD DVD has lots of good extras, a sharp picture, and pristine sound.  I just wish it was out on blu-ray as that is the format I've chosen to stick with.  Lucky for me I also have the HD DVD player add-on for my Xbox 360 (I bought it just to make sure I was set no matter which format won the war), and I absolutely had to have this title in HD.  Great movie, great picture quality.  The combo format will help make sure I can enjoy this title no matter where I am or what kind of player I have.  It's an all-around great deal.
B000002GOZ|5.0|I am please with this cd, it offers a different sound of many very well known songs, Bryan Adams and friends offer a top notch perfermance.  The sound is very good and the choice of track is perfect for this kind of performance, it helps us discover a different side of Bryan Adams.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|Like most people, I originally purchased this album for \\"Apologize\\", because it's all I hear on the radio, and is the most beautifully unique and emotional track out there.  But as the album progressed, I realized there's more to this album than just track #4 and Timbaland's remix as bonus track #13.<br /><br />I'd never heard a more emotion-heavy album since Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  You can feel Tedder's pain on \\"Apologize\\" with the line: \\"I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue and you say 'Sorry' like the angel heaven let me think was you\\".  Every song on this album leaves the listener sympathizing with Tedder.<br /><br />Stand outs on this album: #'s 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11 & bonus track #13.
0307346617|5.0|This isn't a novel about zombies, it's a post-toasty.  The zombies are just the catalyst for the post-apocalyptic theme.  If this book had been about zombies, I probably wouldn't have bought it, but I knew upon reading the first page, that it was so much more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the interview writing style as it gave the author a lot of leeway in telling the story saving him the trouble of creating an arc around one or a couple of protagonists.  It also made it much more personal and allowed for a broader world view.  Most post-toasties are sadly confined to a small geographic region - one or two countries, perhaps a continent.  Thankfully the author avoided that pitfall.<br /><br />Indeed the author's political views, musical tastes, and filmmaker idols seeped through - Howard Dean, General Colin Powell, Martin Scorsese and even Michael Stipe.  However, I don't think this detracted from the story telling at all.  It simply added a bit of pop culture nuance and thankfully wasn't overwhelming.<br /><br />The portrayal of the Yonkers' battle was classic military mismanagement.  Put the troops in hindering battle gear and without a well thought out plan.  This is not at all far-fetched.<br /><br />The one thing that I found extremely annoying is that he kept referring to BDUs when the Army phased them out in 2006 and replaced them with ACUs.  I'm sure at the time the novel was written the Army was still using BDUs, but it's still annoying.  The point about useless camouflage in the story was good for the scenario.<br /><br />Some classics in this genre are: Alas, Babylon, I am Legend, Swan Song, Warday and even the extremely dated albeit classic The Stand.<br /><br />I hope others aren't put off by the zombies and give this novel a chance.

B000002QWD|5.0|This album (Bing Crosby's \\"White Christmas\\") is a true Classic.  This year (2007) I am celebrating my 64th Christmas, and I don't remember a single Christmas without this album.  My mother had the album on 78 rpm records.  The original title was \\"Merry Christmas\\", and it consisted of only eight of the present twelve songs.  (\\"Silver Bells\\", \\"It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas\\", \\"Christmas in Killarney\\" and \\"Mele Kalikimaka\\" were not included; they were added later.)  I bought the album on LP record in 1968, and just this year I purchased the CD.  My family played the old 78s until the center holes were so worn that the records wobbled on the turntable.  Bing Crosby, I believe, was the first to sing the song \\"White Christmas\\", first in the film \\"Holiday Inn\\" and later in the film \\"White Christmas\\".  All of these songs have been recorded by countless artists in every musical style, but nobody ever sang \\"Jingle Bells\\" or \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" like Bing, accompanied by the Andrews Sisters.  I believe this album will live as long as there is a Christmas.

0740748475|5.0|A wish come true for all Calvin & Hobbes fans. If there is anything to complaint about, it is the size and weight of the works. The volumes are not something you take into bus when commuting. Well, on the other hand the set is well made and robust, and above all, full of delightful Calvin & Hobbes gags. Reminds me of the times I was of the same age. It's refreshing to feel so young again!

B000RW3VD4|5.0|I am the CEO of a big company and although I of course never would do some of the things that go on in this movie, its the kind of movie that gets your business blood pumping!  I recently was involved in a big M&A deal and my brother was calling me everyday with some line from the movie...  \\"Greed is Good\\",  \\"Money Never Sleeps Pal\\" stuff like that.  It was bringing back old memories so I bought him and I each the 20th anniversary edition!  What a classic!  Its everything you wish you could do but never would!    Put Michael Douglass with Charlie and Martin Sheen and its a great entertaining movie!   First half is priceless with young Bud (Charlie) trying to land the big Whale (Douglas as Gordon Gecko).  Greed eventually crosses the line the end is predictable but there is a very good reason why so many businessmen love this movie!  Having Daryl Hannah nude in a bedroom scene with Charlie is a \\"bonus\\" guy track!    Give it with Boiler Room as a great one two punch since Boiler Room has a fantastic scene of those actors (Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi) watching Wall Street on TV and acting it out in Vin's living room word for word.    Great Guy Gift, its timeless and never falls short of entertaining!
B00018TI5E|4.0|A really enchanting piece of music. I wish all his songs were produced at this level. So many diamonds in the rough ...left unpolished and unheard. If he were to use his money and talent to make his music more listenable by proper finishing - he'd be bigger than the Beatles. As it is, the starkness of his production makes it seem as if he's a home studio wannabee with potential. Sad. His music could bring joy to so many people - but they'll never get past its  \\"garage band\\" appearance. Sad. John share please.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I will come back and write a review when the blu-ray version comes out.
0307387151|5.0|The quirky ending of this work is the first inkling that the reader has been reviewing Briony's promise to atone for her injustice done to her Sister and Robbie by exposing her crime as well as those of her Cousin Lola and Paul Marshall who supposedly attacked Lola. She realizes that, in remembering the attack, and reading a letter from her Father, the supposed rape was consensual sex. During Briony's musings in 1999, she leaves the reader of her novel with two questions, was there ever a reunion of Cecilia and Robbie, or were they both killed during the war? Since the novel could not be published until the deaths of the Marshalls and herself, she leaves the soon to be readership to puzzle over which ending most suits them. In a way, this is her atonement by confession and a statement of privacy for her beloved Sister and Robbie. The idea that their story would be told and be a mystery at the same time would be a fitting justice to a world which had punished the innocent and ruined so many lives.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|In a year plagued with re-releases, delays, and the scrapping of albums altogether, it is very lucky that we got to hear Kelly Clarkson's My December at all. It was reported that label head Clive Davis was not satisfied with the album, some even claiming that he wanted Kelly to start from scratch. Kelly herself later confirmed these rumours, stating that the label felt the album was too negative. It is certainly true that My December lacks the commercial appeal of Kelly's previous works, but it is precisely because it is so dark and personal that it stands out as one of the better selections of the year.    Lead single \\"Never Again\\" is widely thought to be a continuation of \\"Since U Been Gone\\" and \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\" off her last album, although Kelly has repeatedly stated that this was not her intent. This is easily the most commercial song on the album, containing a much angrier and more bitter tone than its predecessors. Stylistically, it's probably not one of the best indicators of the direction of the album, but it certainly fits the theme. \\"One Minute\\" was originally intended to be on the Breakaway album, but was later revised and placed on this album instead. This one is not as immediately appealing as the previous track, but it is something of a grower. However, with so much better material on the rest of the album, it tends to get lost in the shuffle. The same could be said for \\"Hole\\", although it does fare somewhat better. The main problem with this track is the chorus is subpar lyrically, which is just puzzling because the rest of the lyrics are quite good. The chorus actually borders on obnoxious at times, but the rest of the track for the most part makes up for it.     Next up is a personal favourite in the form of \\"Sober\\", a hypnotic ballad about survival. Kelly has explicitly stated in interviews that this song is a metaphor, discussing any kind of addiction in your life, to counter assumptions that it was about personal experiences with alcoholand/or drugs. Both lyrically and musically, this song is simple yet beautiful, featuring a very controlled vocal performance which suits the tone impeccably. Without a doubt, this is an example of Kelly at her best. \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is another more commercial offering, and logical choice for a single. This is actually one of the better upbeat tracks, although it may take a while to be appreciated when placed against the numerous stunning slower tracks this album features. As with \\"One Minute\\", this is very much a grower, although it is somewhat better. \\"Judas\\" is an interesting song, although it may be a little too personal in the sense that is it not as easy to relate to. In case anyone's still wondering, the title is a Biblical reference to Judas, who betrayed Jesus. It is one of the stronger tracks, featuring controlled yet expressive vocals although some may find it a little repetitive.    The middle three tracks on this album are all prime examples of Kelly at her best. \\"Haunted\\", I have recently learned, is about someone Kelly knew who committed suicide. It is stylistically reminiscent of Evanescence and a great showcase of Kelly's songwriting skills. It's also quite interesting how Kelly's vocals are layered during the chorus, adding depth without cluttering the track with background singers. \\"Be Still\\" is a much calmer, country-influenced ballad and another indication of Kelly's songwriting talents. It seems to be a call to a former lover for a second chance, and strikes a nice contrast with the darker, angrier tones of the rest of the album. \\"Maybe\\" is the third of set of highlights, and continues much in the same vein as the previous track. It's a very raw track, which reads as if it were taken word-for-word from a diary entry. It once again highlights Kelly's lyrical abilities, and controlled vocal delivery. As individual tracks, each of the three would have been highlights, but taken together they make up a stunning combination which gives a firmindication of Kelly's potential, when permitted (however grudgingly) to release the kind of music she likes. \\"How I Feel\\" was another grower for me, although I still think the peppy, upbeat sound doesn't quite fit with the lyrics. Aside from that, it is a catchy offering, although does not fare as well when compared to the rest of the songs.    \\"Yeah\\" is easily my least favourite song on the entire album, due to the obnoxious chorus. If it weren't for that, it would be quite a strong track. The verses are good, but the chorus is lacklustre and detracts somewhat from the otherwise decent track. The bridge in particular sounds great. \\"Can I Have a Kiss\\" is another of the more mellow tracks, and much sweeter and more positive than the rest of the album. It again epitomizes everything that is good about this album: controlled vocals, well-written lyrics, and an emotive delivery. \\"Irvine\\", according to Kelly, was written while sitting on the bathroom floor of a concert venue at a time when she was feeling her lowest. It has a very stripped down, almost unplugged kind of feel. This is another album highlight, by far, an easily one of the most emotive songs. If I'm not mistaken, it was recorded in a single take. Finally, the bonus track \\"Chivas\\" is a sassy kiss-off to a former boyfriend. The acoustic style really adds to the song, as just Kelly and the guitar are all it really needs. I would love for Kelly to do more songs in a similar style.    Overall Mark: 4/5    An album like this makes me respect Kelly that much more, especially since she had a major hand in writing every song. While I enjoyed her first two albums, I never really got the sense that either of them were really \\"Kelly\\". It truly is a much darker, more negative sound than her previous work but it is material like this that shows the maturity and often the personal side to the artist. The ballads in particular showcase Kelly at her best, lyrically and vocally. I could have done with fewer of the rock tracks (\\"One Minute\\"), or at least rewrites (\\"Hole\\", \\"Yeah\\") in favour of the more introspective ballads. Nonetheless, if this is any indication of Kelly's future direction, I say Clive should sit back and let her have control.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Never thought anything could top Grease for a Movie Musical but I was pleasantly surprised that this is IT! Great performance from all cast members and the music is unbelievable. Quality of DVD was excellent. Overall very pleased with my purchase.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|Killer.  I am going to order the AC30 one also.  Great sound and value.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|WOW. Paramore caught my eye through \\"Misery Business\\", and then \\"Pressure\\"...soon enough, I knew most of the songs without even owning the cd. It's so much more that I expected. The lyrics are clean. The message clear. They capture \\"teenager-dom\\" perfectly. I have every song memorized and can't get enough, I listen to it over and over. Makes a great gift!-most teenagers, no matter what their music preferences, will like Paramore.        **This isn't really Mark Windsor. This is is 15-year old daughter(:
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I have watched numbers of nature shows and series over times, so this series didn't really surprised me too much with new information.  They covered a wide range of animals and typologies in the give time and space to do so.  I was not so sure on the chronological order of some of the scenes relative to one another, but that is minor.  What I did enjoy is the angle of the cameras and scenes, which is a little fresh to the genre, but not too much.  What I am disappointed is the HD presentation.  I don't think they used the latest and greatest HD cameras out there.  The scenes of some of shots varied greatly.  Some shots looked as great as all 1080 dpi, while other looked like DVD and even tape qualities at times.<br /><br />I am pretty sure there are some analog shots mixed in with some digital shots, but overall this is a solid animal/nature series.  I watched this on blu-ray not HD-DVD.
0226039331|5.0|Briefly, this lexicon is a scholarly lexicon.  Some of the other reviews have criticized that its definitions are inappropriate for beginning students, and that is true becasuse this is the most advanced and comprehensive lexicon that does justice to the imprecisions within the greek language.  More often than not, a Greek word cannot be exactly equated with an English equivalent.  This lexicon does justice to the broad semantic ranges of even the most obscure Greek word.  This is recommended for scholars and serious students of Koine Greek.  This lexicon is also an outstanding reference for scholarly publications concerning the Greek text.    There is also a version available for the Logos software suite.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|I couldn't tell you if the movie is good because I haven't recieved it, even though it released two weeks ago and I pre-ordered it.
B000TLTUL0|3.0|It's been more than a quarter of a century since Stephen Sondheim's musical thriller \\"Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" opened on Broadway, and finally it has been brought to the big screen by Tim Burton, whose morbid wit has devised such movies as \\"Ed Wood\\". Based on a horror story from Victorian England, the legend of Sweeney Todd was filmed as a non-musical in 1936, starring the appropriately named Tod Slaughter. The psychopathic barber is played this time by Burton's frequent collaborator Johnny Depp. Sondheim himself is barely mentioned by Marketing; and his score, not unexpectedly, has been diminished, which causes disappointments. All the connecting choruses are gone (so Sweeney doesn't make that hair-raising first entrance he did on stage), and the brilliant ensemble number \\"God, That's Good!\\" is so abridged it's pointless. It's not just the cuts: the special effects (including Sweeney's graphic \\"executions\\" and the dark-as-Dickens London) nearly overshadow the score. I was apprehensive when I read of Depp's casting in the title role, but he's a revelation. With his sunken eyes and his traumatic mèche, not to mention a strong if somewhat anachronistic pop tenor, he gives his maniac a presence of homicidal fury. Less successful is Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs Lovett. Perhaps she meant to reveal the character's cold amorality, but she's a cipher on the screen. Her \\"The Worst Pies in London\\", which should have been hilarious, is flat. Plus she seems too young. It's never mentioned, but the implication is Mrs Lovett is older than Sweeney. If Burton had asked my opinion (alas! he didn't) I would have suggested Meryl Streep as an interesting Mrs Lovett. Depp gets his strongest support from Alan Rickman, a really vicious Judge Turpin, and Ed Sanders, whose treble interpretaion of \\"Not While I'm Around\\" is a highlight. While this is not a great version of Sondheim's masterpiece, one can be thankful that in this decade of movies increasingly resemblingTV shows (I had to sit through the preview of a \\"Lost\\" clone) Burton has created a \\"Sweeney Todd\\" that combines music and murder in a diverting entertainment.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|The helpful reviews deserve some thanks.  Thanks also to Michael Moore for a provocative movie as usual.  There have been 150+ reviews, most of them good so I'll be brief here.<br /><br />Sicko has motivated some who have previously shown little interest in national affairs.  I have witnessed people awaken and begin speaking up.  I credit Michael Moore and his people for this miracle here.<br /><br />The numbers speak for themselves.  Overall, the numbers reveal that Americans live surprisingly short and less than healthy lives.  The costs are crazy for the amount delivered.  The fret of a long wait in line isn't a reasonable retort for health care that is abysmal.  There is no excuse for accepting unhealthiness and early death of our loved ones.  None.  Nada.  Don't even think of denying it.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I do not discuss plots with movies. Better to not ruin things and let people watch without knowing what is going to happen.<br /><br />Absolutely awesome. The best Bourne yet and maybe the best action flick of the year. If it isnt number 1, it is very close!!
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Beverly Hills 90210 was a hit show back in the 90s. Watching those first few shows is nostalgic and brings back wonderful memories. You will enjoy the drama, problems, and solutions the cast brings to the show. A great gift for those who remember what the 90s were like.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|I do not discuss plots with movies. Better to not ruin things and let people watch without knowing what is going to happen.<br /><br />Maybe it is because I love Hopkins, but I thought this was a pretty good movie, well worth watching and certainly worth owning.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|This series was one of my favorites, and while this season did not live up to my expectations, I feel that the last episode made up for it at least a little.  I would call the ending bittersweet, and while I wish it would have continued, no Gilmore Girls collection is complete without this season.
B000Y1ZXU2|4.0|Packaging is just like 10,000 days pkg w/ magnifying glass cover to view pieces of still shots included inside. Adam jones & alex grey created another surreal world w/ imagery only yourself can comprehend. Some lightly animated Grey art from net of being shows up along w/ some eerie creatures. You get a tour of Alex grey's art museum, some behind the scenes interviews w/ people who know Adam and how he got involved in art. Guest commentary is by David cross but not too much funny really happens since he claims that he has not even heard the song and is just trying to 'comment' on a surreal video. It's still alot of $ to spend on one video (they can fit all their latest vids on one dvd easily from the past couple of albums. Check out the Parabola vid from Tool . For some reason i like that one better then this video.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|I really like the look of this watch.  I'm having trouble with the clasp not staying closed, but other than that, it's perfect.
B000TLTUL0|4.0|I hate in musicals when people sing something for 5 minutes when they could just say it in a matter of seconds, but Sweeney Todd won me over. I am a big fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, so that is what really got me into the theater (not to mention all the great critic reviews). Johnny Depp should and will likely get an Oscar nomination. He is fantastic in every sense, as is Helena Bonham Carter. While the singing isn't the best in terms of vocal power and range, both Depp and Carter make up for it in performance. The sets are amazing and the gore flows in rivers.<br /><br />Sweeney Todd is very disturbing and will probably turn off more than a few people, but it is a very well made movie musical. Nothing like some throat slashing around the holidays.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She has had one for several years and loved it.  Says it is wonderful.  Her old one broke and needed repair.  She felt lost without it and asked for a new one for Christmas!!
B0000DYKET|5.0|I've owned my [[ASIN:B0000DYKET Men's Keen Newports]] for over two years - three summers and now 3 days before Christmas in the third winter. Sadly I usually have to put them away for weeks at a time from January thru March, but even so I DO wear them off and on in the dead of winter. I am NOT easy on these either. I'm a pro photographer and very active in the outdoors of Washington and the Pacific Northwest. they see more than their share of salt water while kayaking and boating and climbing up and down rough terrain to \\"get the shot.\\" Admittedly, when I'm not 'out there' my studio is next to my house so I wear them like slippers to \\"commute\\" across the garden and into the studio. They still look pretty good too, though I think I'll be due for an additional pair this coming summer, though I see no reason to not continue to wear these for saltwater use.     One thing I should mention though is if you wear them barefoot continually, you will need to give them a soapy soak periodically because they will begin to stink ( documented by several of my friends also). But I'll wear them with socks when it gets chilly (but not when it rains) during the fall and winter and washing is unnecessary. I'll go for the Newports again.
