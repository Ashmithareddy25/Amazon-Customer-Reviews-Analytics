B001P06GX4|5.0|I have two kids and this is a family game. My daughter is asking me to play this game everyday and I really enjoy playing this game. Highly recommend this game!!
B00FRN2QZM|5.0|The wait for AFI's new album was definitely worth it. They're back with another amazing album that's got both a haunting and all rock sound. Favorite tracks are &#34;The Sinking Night&#34;, &#34;I Hope You Suffer&#34;, &#34;The Conductor&#34;, and &#34;17 Crimes&#34;.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I picked these up on a sale price.  Sounds great with music and gaming.  I've only tested on CS:GO and Battlefield 3, but the sound is top notch and the battery life has been great.  The headset does a great job at blocking out all the other noise in the room.<br /><br />I also like the fact that they included a USB port on the charging station. You don't lose any open ports when the headset is plugged in to recharge.
B000YENUIQ|5.0|Mortensen and Watts have a great chemistry, both carrying the guts of the movie with genuine involvement. The premise is probably reality based and to me it was an educational trip, its supporting actors doing a great portrayal of the underground tyranny.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Don't know what all the fuss is about. No more eroticism in here than your average &#34;romance&#34; novel, in fact I would say there is less. The whole story line seems to be contrived and forced. For once I hope a movie doesn't stay true to the book.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I had rented this movie in the past and wanted to see it again so I purchased it. I will watch  it several more times. The underlying message is all too true, earth is being destroyed in many ways, and the fat people on the space sphere says more than words.
B000050HTO|5.0|This CD depicts 2 stages in the life of Bob Dylan - each stage is brilliant and lifts the soul.
1476735115|3.0|I have read many Sci-Fi novels, and if it is about destroyed earth and survivors ruled by cruel dictators, it doesn't matter if it is a silo, district, cave or whereever, the same Sci-Fi theme seems to prevail.: &#34;Wool&#34;: is not one that I would consider dynamic. Dull would be the word I would use. Destroyed earth and survivors ruled by cruel dictators? I guess my strongest criticism would be lack of character development, perhaps because there are too many. I will admit it was a page turner because I wanted to know how it ended, and was disappointed in that.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent plot and character development! Hosseini Met and exceeded my expectations. I can't wait to read his next book. I was sorry it had to end.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Finally- what a &#34;timely&#34; app to have on hand for any musician! Clear, easy to use, easy to read. I like how there is a volume option on the page itself, so that I don't have to go into my own settings to make it louder or quieter- this is much better when you need a quick change in volume!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|LOVE this game .Never any problems. Good family fun!!!!!! Never have to worry about losing anything I never have to worry about it freezing this is one game I can sit back and enjoy!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I recently bought this device expecting not much given the $35 against a more expensive but powerful device like Roku streaming stick which costs around $70. It's amazing how poor this device performs in the living room. I have a Vizio TV that already supports YouTube and Netflix but I didn't like the browsing experience. Chromecast just show to me a bad experience from the beginning to the end. During the setup process, it updated twice, needed to reset the device around three times to make it work, after all the mess... the wifi signal was so poor even using the \\"extension\\" provided. Considering the TV has a very good signal and my iPad too has a very good signal on the SAME living room, it is disappointing to see the one bar wifi icon and chromecast complaining about the signal. Then came the real job... trying to stream a youtube video just didn't start after a minute, the iPad consumed too much more battery than watching the same video from the iPad. It's known that the device establishes the connection with the provided wifi and not with the iPad itself so I cannot understand how bad the app was programmed to end up taking all that juice from it.<br />Overall, I recommend to stay AWAY from this device and if you are willing to spend the money, take another $30 bucks to buy Roku's stick. Bundled with more channels, features you won't feel that disappointment from a dead product (like many other Google failures poorly engineered).
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Emma Chase has a perfect way of writing from Drew 's pov. This book has everything a good book needs. It has humor, romance, steam, and characters you can connect with.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading. You will not be disappointed.
B00B8BR6CU|5.0|This has become one of my all time favorite films. I love the time period. The acting, isn't acting. You get so lost in the story of the 'players&#34; acting Romeo and Juliet, that by the time you get to see the actual play, you forget you're watching Shakespeare. Anyone who likes a good old fashioned love story...You have to see this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Performs well on my 52 inch HDMI TV.  You must use Google Chrome as your browser for it to work.  Disappointed when I rented an Amazon movie that wouldn't 'cast'.  The frame showed on the screen, but not the video or sound.<br /><br />Also, I would like to display my personal files like photos and MP4 videos.  You would have to move these to the cloud first, and then watch them.<br /><br />Clever small package,  There is some minor delay when 'casting' between the computer screen and the TV.  Also, all activity ( clicking ) must be done on the computer, as cursor does not show on screen.
B00271DNP4|5.0|I liked the ending very much and it was very steady pace and I just thought it was a very good movie in a lot like the book
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book will not leave you disappointed.  I gasped, I smiled, I definitely grabbed the box of tissues several times.  This isn't your typical Stephen King novel, although his writing style is obviously the same.  I loved everything about this book, and I can't wait to read it again!
B005LAIIMG|3.0|We were disappointed in this video.......not as exciting as promoted to be.....but then again we are avid walking dead fans and this movie did not even come close to being as good....it was okay and that is about all I can say.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Liked this better than the first, quick easy read. Loved it, plan to read the next. Hope it lives up to the hype.
6305428042|5.0|Best Halloween Movie Ever! Yeah this is meant for little kids, but even my boyfriend who just turned 23 loves this movie!~
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Hard to put down!!! It is one of the best games that I've ever downloaded. This is a must have.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was WICKEDly good and the ending surprising.  This whole series was so good I hated to put it down. Dashner out did himself on this series. The prequel to the series did a lot to help explain how the world ended up so horrible.  GREAT JOB!
B0086700CM|5.0|My friends always had this game on their ipods and now I can enjoy it with them on my kindle fire. Great game and very good graphics.
B00G32QIEG|2.0|This movie was really bad which sucks 'cause I really wanted it to be good. The premise is great the execution .. terrible ...
B00DF7HWQU|5.0|Great book. Author  S. J. Watson developed a very clever plot line in her first novel that was intriguing and clever.  Couldn't put the book down.  One of the best this year!  Highly recommend.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Great and heartbreaking account.  Very informative and informational about what it takes to be a Seal!  I would highly recommend this book.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|This book opened my eyes for my own shortcomings about eaquality. I truely belived that had this in place, but girl was I wrong. Thank you Sheryl.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. I don't have to look for cards or a place to play. I don't have to worry about the dogs eating my cards.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! so addicting. keeps you entertained and your mind sharp. if only you didn't have time outs. But I give it the five star rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally released for the Kindle Fire!!! We've been waiting a very long time for this.Very addictive and fun to play. The price is right!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is one of Google's best inventions. I've been using this on a daily basis to stream YouTube and Netflix to my televisions.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Game is frustrating. There is not enough hints or instructions to be able to know what to do next on screen.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|a great combination of suspense, horror,  sentimentality, action, relationaships, etc..  not too gorry, but still heart pounding.  would recommend it
B0000075WM|3.0|I like Vixen and their style of music. I chose this rating because I was disappointed in just getting a single rather  the second album by Vixen although it maybe a mistake on my part for not reading thoroughly.
B00G32PQNA|1.0|This was by far the worst movie I have ever watched.  It was two people talking.  That's all it was.  Then they argued.  Then it was midnight and everything was better.  BORING!!!
B00G23JMLW|5.0|The true story of Gia, the first ever supermodel. It's a beautiful movie and wonderfully acted by all involved, but especially Angelina Jolie. Highly recommend watching, it's definitely worth the time and money.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I was recommended this book by a co-worker but the only thing that really stood out to me about this book was the ending...literally the last 2 sentences!!  Otherwise, its ehh...kinda cheesy despite the fact that the characters have terminal illnesses. I guess I am just not a fan of teenage love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love It!  Best Game I ever played.  Very Additive. Always lots of fun. Never played any games till Candy Crush came out.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Great Cast.  Great voices all roles!!  The Queen, Dana Damrau  is particularly memorable.<br /><br />I await future productions of this cast of characters!!!!!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I love this movie!! When we saw it at the theatre I was very intrigued by it and knew I wanted to see it again.<br />After this purchase I've watched it twice now and still enjoy it.<br /><br />I certainly recommend it to others.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|I could watch Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in as many sequels, prequels or avengers that they make.  I think he really made this character come alive with his own brand of swagger.  This 3rd edition is a little bit different than the last two, as Iron Man faces some different challenges.  So fun performances from Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley with some plot twists that will keep things interesting.  If you are  fan of the Marvel movies, you will enjoy this one too.
B003Y059EK|1.0|Horrible! Scared my 10 and 6 year old to death! We turned it off 1/2 way through! Wish I would have saved my money!
B00F35BV64|4.0|JJ Abrams has put forth another entertaining installment of the rebooted Star Trek series.  The movie has great visuals, action and a thrilling story to keep you entertained.  Benedict Cumberbatch is no Ricardo Montebaln, but I really loved his version of Khan.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILERS***** \\"Divergent\\" was 5 stars for me, \\"Insurgent\\" was 4 to 4 1/2 but I couldn't give this more than 3 even though I really wanted to like it so much more.  I am a 39 year old female, long way away from a YA, but I really loved \\"Divergent\\".  I will probably see the movie but I haven't decided how crazy I am about it yet given what I know is coming.  I even KNEW going into reading \\"Allegiant\\" what was coming because I did not avoid the Internet carefully enough but I still chose to read it.  I also read TONS of reviews, more bad than good, but knew I had to read it for myself.  Honestly, I am glad I was emotionally prepared for Tris' death.  YUCK.  I didn't even mind the shared POV because I LOVE Tobias/Four as a character but it seemed out of nowhere to make it HIS story because that is what felt like happened to me.  They are Ms. Roth's characters to do with what she writes, but it felt like she just decided she was done with Tris and wanted to write Tobias more.  In the end, his story seems so hopeless, it was utterly depressing.  It sounds like he will never love again even though he has to keep going forward--- and maybe that is a lot harder than what Tris had to do? But I still didn't like it, that there was no happy ending-- can't help it that I wanted a happy ending at least for them or who cares, even a tortured ending like Katniss and Peeta, at least they'd be together and some of what they went through would be worth it.  Tris staying true to Abnegation to the end was not good for me since Tobias recognizes that even Abnegation in its selflessness was flawed as much as the other factions.  It just ruined the whole love story for me- Tris was too smart not to recognize the same thing and to let her Abnegation emotions take over for her like that.  Her mother's sacrifice was not a decision, it just came naturally because Tris was her daughter but to me that is why the end of this series seemed so contrived and not true to itself anymore.  It just didn't seem necessary and makes me loathe Caleb.  That is why I'm not sure I can watch the movie...knowing what becomes of some of these characters even though I really loved a lot of them.  I didn't think it was boring but the whole story was a little confusing with the US government and the Bureau, who was in charge anyway?  It just seemed so disjointed from the trajectory of the first two, I wanted to love it like I did the first two but I just couldn't. It just wasn't the journey I expected and I was too let down by the hopeless, depressing ending to love it like I did the others.  And believe me, I really wanted to.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|After watching and reading about how much of a disaster this movie was going to be, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a very interesting story about how the world would potentially react to a global crisis.  I thought it was a compelling look at how humans would respond in the face of death caused by a global pandemic.  Ultimately, everyone's survival instinct kicks in.  There are no standout performances.  Brad Pitt was good enough.  I think I liked the performances of all the zombies best, as well as the music.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|This app is very easy to use and I can view and listen to all of the podcadts I get on my iphone.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|By the time I reached season 4, I just could not stop watching episodes.  I was on a total binge trying to finish as many episodes as possible.  If you are contemplating season 4, it should be a no brainer.  Not much else needs to be said.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|While not destined to become an epic classic, this is a feel-good, do-good movie, inspiring me to make an effort to be a positive influence in the lives of those around me. If you know any true Southern women, you know the writers and Sandra Bullock's portrayal hit the nail on the head.
1585104205|5.0|I've long believed that languages are best learned by immersion, and my own personal success with this marvelous text is a testament to that. Unlike most Latin primers, Lingua Latina is written entirely in Latin, and Orberg forces you to use the abundant contextual clues to make sense of the language. To aid the reader, Orberg takes advantage of the many English words which have been derived from Latin and peppers them generously throughout the text to clear up the usual ambiguities that come with learning a language.<br /><br />Still, it is impossible to master any language without a firm grip on its grammar, and I would highly recommend that learners who are new to the language use this book in conjunction with a more standard textbook (I'd personally recommend Keller and Russell's Learn to Read Latin, which is considerably more thorough than Wheelock's).
B00511ONPG|5.0|One of my favorite past times is reading books by people who are doing great things. Dave Kerpen, CEO and Founder of Likeable Marketing, falls in to this category with his book Likeable: Social Media. How to Delight your Customers, Create an Irresistible brand, and Be generally amazing on Facebook (and other social networks).  The book sheds light on using Social Media to brand a business.  It’s based on a very simple idea: Be Likeable.<br /><br />Dave’s content is supported by examples, examples and more examples.  This provides a lot of context and how working social media, in Likeable fundamentals, can brand your company through word of mouth marketing. One of my favorite examples is about targeting a very specific type of demographic. To practice Dave took an Advertisement out on Facebook and targeted his wife, and only his wife. This has been a large part of how I have tailored this very blog. Targeting transitioning military looking to stay in the D.C. area.<br /><br />The style of writing is very similar to reading a series of blog postings. Titles and subtitles are very clean and concise.  Sub-titles such as: “Eight Cool Things You Can Do with A Facebook Ad” and “How to get the Like: Develop Your Value Proposition” give a blog feel. Coupled with a very relaxed conversational tone makes this book an easy and enjoyable read.<br /><br />Lastly, all the tools provided can be used be practice by you, right now.  Every chapter ends with a Call to Action that gives the reader a framework to start when it comes to marketing and branding. This was a great part of Dave’s book.  Practical usage and exercises, if performed, can start showing results as quickly as a week, maybe longer depending on the action item.<br /><br />During my reading, and knowing I was doing this book review, I was looking for something to enhance the book series. It was hard to find something. Some suggestions are:<br /><br />Before purchasing the book, have a fundamental understanding of Social Media as a whole. Dave dives right in to Facebook advertising, targeting, and other aspects. For a true social media Novice this could be a little daunting and scary.<br />Dave focuses heavily on Facebook. I hope he releases more books that encompass his dealings with LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, and Google+. He has a lot of Social media knowledge that can be shared across these different platforms.<br /><br />Pick Up Dave’s book or his other Likeable series and you will not be disappointed. Great content, easy read, and action items that will actually work.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book. It was like coming home to an old friend. It is paced completely different than The Shining. Also it is much easier to love the characters. I hated Jack Torrance but loved Doc and still do.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|i bought this as a gift for myself, because I've always wanted an automatic watch but never wanted to pay the high prices!<br />This is a great starter watch to get into automatics/mechanical watches.<br /><br />I was hesitant on getting this one, due to the negative reviews I've read about it, but after sitting on it for a year, I finally pulled the trigger to get it, and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I was most worried about the watch losing power while I sleep and having to reset it every morning.<br />I've had this watch for 2 days now and I wore it from 8am-10pm.<br />Set it on my bedside table from 10pm-8am and it still works, no issues.<br /><br />love it!<br /><br />highly recommend as a gift for the upcoming holiday season!
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|Everybody knows Hysteria, if you don't you may want to get out from under your rock. The Ded Flatbird portion is what sold me. Hearing stuff live from the band that was recorded over 30 years ago was awesome! Especially Good Morning Freedom, which isn't even on an album that you can purchase today. Matter of fact, the first two in this set, Good Morning Freedom and Wasted will simply melt your face off, they play them hard, crank them up as loud as you can stand it. The entire set is fantastic, and the price couldn't be better, this is a must purchase. I don't know why this band isn't in the Rock Hall of Fame, they are long overdue for introduction.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|It was a wonderful story and adaptation of Lincoln the President. The story line stayed confined to the period  of our nation and the  supporting actors, actresses were very exceptional. It was a history lesson for us all. It makes you wonder that all the discord between parties hasn't really changed much. The Dems & Repubs are still fighting.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely adores the panda games and has even taught her grandad how to use a tablet by playing these games with her.WTG grandad
B00124PXW8|5.0|It is best to see it late at night with no lights on.  Cuddle closely with you loved one, hold them tight!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was enjoyable from start to finish.  Had a little bit of everything in it and certainly made for good conversation with friends also reading it along the way.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well I downloaded this game last night played it today and must say I love playing it... it doesn't lag or skip freeze nothing like other games I've played... I'm already getting better at it too lol
B00E9ZATTY|5.0|As a current college student myself, Monsters University was number one on my to-watch list this summer. Just like Toy Story 3 which told of Andy going to college right as I set out on my Freshman year, Monsters University came to pick up where that left off- at that important moment when you have to actually work for your future, realize your passions, and sometimes compromise on your dreams.<br />Something college students face that is touched upon in the film is that we won't always be successful- studying hard doesn't give you talent and you can't always avoid tough professors or challenging projects that could ruin your entire college career in one blow.<br />Sure, the movie goes on it's essential college frat-house trope, but that works for people who want to see something that'll get them excited for college to start.<br /><br />I think most importantly this movie shows that there isn't just one direct path to success. It's possible to fail even though you try your hardest, and it's possible to dust yourself off and try again in a less traditional way.<br /><br />Ultimately this movie is about failure as much as it is about success, and it's got pretty realistic struggles and consequences for a movie about monsters.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great app for kids youth and adults who like to figure out puzzles without the cleanup. Would recommend this app to all.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This and more reviews at The Book Bar.co<br /><br />The story begins with Drew holed up in his apartment. He has convinced himself he has the flu, but is really a heartbroken mess. Drew never thought the day would come when he'd fall in love and, worse, that the girl could choose someone else. His sister decides that she's going to help him fix it, but first he tells us his story...<br /><br />One of the things I loved about this book was how Drew speaks directly to us, the readers. It was unique and made me feel like I was being told a story vs. reading a story. If that makes sense. :)<br /><br />\\"First of all, if a chick wants me to respect her, she needs to act like someone worth respecting. Second, I'm not trying to be a (private member); I'm just being a guy. And all guys talk to their friends about sex.<br /><br />Let me repeat that in case you missed it: ALL GUYS TALK TO THEIR FRIENDS ABOUT SEX.<br /><br />If a guy tells you he doesn't? Dump him, because he's lying to you.\\"<br />Tangled. Chase, Emma.<br /><br />Drew meets Kate at a bar shortly after leaving his latest conquest in the bathroom. He tries to charm her only to learn that she is engaged. This doesn't deter him though and he continues trying to seduce her. She politely turns him down and walks away.<br /><br />He goes to work on Monday and she is introduced as a new employee. Drew is a successful investment banker at his fathers company and works very hard. He has a strict rule of not messing with women at his office, but he can't get her out of his head.<br /><br />\\"So, I have three options: I can quit. I could get Kate to quit. Or I can entice her to share one profoundly pleasurable night with me. Get it out of both of our systems-consequences be damned.<br />Guess which one I'm going to pick?\\"<br />Tangled. Chase, Emma.<br /><br />Shortly after putting his plan to seduce Kate into motion, his father drops the bomb that he's going to give a very important client to her instead of him. He tells his father that she's too new and he's the best person for the job. His dad decides that they can both put together presentations and then he will decide. All of a sudden, Kate is his competition. A potential threat to his reputation at the firm and he can't have that.<br /><br />So, how does Drew go from wanting just sex from Kate, to wanting to crush her, to being a lovesick mess? Well, you'll just have to get the book and let Drew tell you his story. I don't want to spoil any of it. Are parts predictable? Sure. Are there some over the top moments that made me roll my eyes a little? Sure. I was entertained from the first page to the end though and loved every minute of it. It's an easy read that will have you laughing and wanting to see this arrogant man find, and hold onto, love.<br /><br />\\"Assume nothing. Even if you think you know everything. Even if you're sure that you're right. Get confirmation. That whole \\"(cross breed between a donkey and a mule)\\" cliche about assuming? It's right on the money.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I totally loved this game, even though I got stuck a few times, I kept wanting to play it. Can't wait for part 2 .
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|The protagonist of Ancillary Justice is one of the most interesting and well-rendered AI characters i have ever encountered.  The novel explores a number of themes in a very intelligent way,  while never failing to be a page-turning space-opera.  Highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is freaking awesome!! I love how instead of coins like in Subway Surfer, they are bananas!! Great game, huys
B00F91SCXC|1.0|all politics , hollywood promo for UN ,NWO and agenda 21 - might as well add libral lefties dream come true

B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This novel is told from the perspective of a male, 30-something Australian academic who has adapted well to his place high on the autistic scale, but who has decided that it is time to find a suitable wife and reproduce.  Very rational.  As the story unfolds, he learns that the skills he has mastered to date are not sufficient for the undertaking, so he develops new ones, including empathy, compromise, and real romantic love.  Delightful character portrayals.  It is easy to sympathize with most of the major characters.  I enjoyed reading this in short bits during train commutes using a Kindle app on my i-Phone.  Easy, peasy...
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very well written.<br />I recomend this one for sure.<br />I couldnt stop untill it was finished :-)
B005LAIH2C|5.0|No, not an Academy Award winning movie, but this one is FUN!!!  Excellently written and has many, many side jokes written in that are executed perfectly!  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, Saturday night movie to just sit back and laugh with!  :)
0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson's latest entertaining book is a look at the summer of 1927. Several momentous events happened that summer, including Charles Lindberg's solo flight across the Atlantic, Babe Ruth's home run record, a catastrophic flood along the Mississippi River, and much more. Bryson is adept at telling these stories and interweaving them, finding extraordinary connections between all the different players. His witty writing makes history fascinating and interesting. I have zero interest in baseball, past or present, but even I enjoyed Babe Ruth's story in this book. That's how good a writer Bryson is. His material is clearly well-researched, but he's good at weeding out the boring bits, leaving only the best stuff to share with his eager readers.<br /><br />Some reviewers have commented that Bryson strays from his stated time period quite a bit, but so what? He needs to tell some backstory in order for the events of 1927 to make sense, and I for one enjoyed hearing all the history, regardless of when it happened. All in all I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable book.
B006C45CFG|5.0|Others may call it &#34;campy&#34;, or too bizarre.  Fact is, it has not only an excellent cast, but is extremely well written and directed.  You can honestly BELIEVE this could have happened in our past, lol.....it's really, really and totally FUN!!!  :)
B000OCXIDK|3.0|I didn't realize that the film was based on a book. The story follows a young girl who goes into service in the house of Johannes Vermeer and has her head turned by the trappings of wealth (or at least the appearance of wealth). The film followed the storyline of the novel almost verbatim but did provide some follow up on a few of the lesser characters.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I thought this might be a fun &#34;B-Grade&#34; movie........WHAT A SURPRISING DELIGHT!!  Fun, VERY well written and directed, good historical continuity and &#34;possibilities&#34;!!!  Yes, very unexpectedly a GOOD movie!!!  Can't believe anyone would not enjoy this if they give it a try.  :)
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|It was everything I hoped it would be and more....<br />On to Volume Book number 2..<br /><br />There is so much 18th century naval language... Beautifully written!!
B00AYASML0|4.0|Record in great shape though it was quite dirty. Once cleaned it sounds great. Of course the record is superb
B0092MKFIY|1.0|I'm not an audiophile, far from it, but the horror stories you find in other reviews of this album, concerning the compression and muffled/distorted audio? They're definitely not exaggerating. Imagine playing really good music through a pair of really bad, underpowered speakers and getting tons of distortions when you should be hearing drum beats or high strung vocals. That cringe you're making? Yeah, that sums up 90% of the album, as it was intentionally over-compressed by the producers. No matter how high grade your audio equipment is, it will never, ever sound good because the production itself was encoded this way. It's just so defeating that the songs have good lyrics, and the music (when audible between distorted drum beats) is generally very good. There's talent in this group, lots of it, and I truly regret that I cannot enjoy their music as it was made, but instead have to suffer through garish distortions and struggle to understand what's behind it.<br /><br />The folks that mastered this album and produced it need to be strung up from the highest tree, because this music has been utterly butchered in the post-production. If I get the chance to hear the band live someday, I'd love to hear what they really sound like. As long as this clown is producing their music, I'll never buy another album of theirs, and not even an MP3. It's been absolutely ruined and the fact that so many reviewers have missed this is astonishing to me. Maybe they're all tone deaf or something, because you'd have to be to think that this stuff sounds good at all.<br /><br />Here's hoping they re-release it and have it re-mastered by someone that doesn't have their head misplaced in their rectum. Until then, I wouldn't recommend this album to my worst enemy.
B00FF8OKJE|1.0|THIS GAME SUCKS WONT EVER BY AGAIN IS REALLY LAME SHOWS GREAT GRAFFICS AND THEN WHEN YOU PLAY IT IS NOTHING LIKE IT SEEMS ON PREVIEW
B000GOTESO|3.0|While I can't give this movie a high rating, I can't deny that it's fun to watch.  It has that big stupid 80s vibe all around it, from the bizarre robot photo shoot scene to the constant health food references.  None of the characters is fleshed out in any way.  You never actually find out any purpose behind the murderous cult featured as the villian.  It exists merely to have a reason for Cobra to do his thing.  If you're looking for some mindless fun, complete with explosions, car chases and guns that never run out of ammo, look no further.
B00F91H666|4.0|Very Good.  I enjoyed the movei but than again with Brad Pitt in it :) who could not like it - the move kept me interested
B009UVWBMA|3.0|Taylor Swift has many good songs, including a few on this album, but it seems that this album contains a lot of songs that have extremely trite lyrics and monotonous tunes.  Taylor's voice range is not highlighted at all in most songs, with her singing maybe 8 notes total.  somewhat dissappointing, and a step down from Speak Now and Fearless.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read all of John Grisham's legal thrillers and this one did not disappoint.  It was a page turner with some unexpected twists and turns!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Very lightweight, flexible and comfortable to use when lying down.  Don't fall out of the ear like earbuds and are in no way bulky.  Have recommended to others who have told me they also find them comfortable.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Cher still has what it takes to belt out those songs, I love this new album.  If you are a Cher fan this album will not disappoint.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great follow up from the original-it gives a lot of insight and background to the original story. It's often hard to accept a sequel, but I think King did a great job, and having it set in current time is nice for someone in my generation.
B002MFULQO|3.0|I was 6 years of age when President Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas. I have read many books about the case including excerpts from the Warren Commission report. I am not convinced by anything I have read or seen that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, nor am I convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed that resulted in a coup d'etat.<br /><br />While JFK spins a good story, there is nothing of substance to prove that a conspiracy existed. It is based on the story of a politician who, in my opinion, may have been seeking public acclaim to perpetuate his own career. The movie addresses many very questionable events that took place the day of the assassination and in the months and years following. But Oliver Stone fall short of making a conclusive argument. As the movie clearly shows, there are many facts that point to some kind of cover-up. And while the story-line never specifically addresses it, the enormous scale of the alleged conspiracy and the thousands of people that had to be involved makes it somewhat implausible.<br /><br />As a period piece, the move is ok. The acting in the movie is stiff.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is one of my family favorite DVD, It is so will played and it really touches your heart, Great price as well
B009WUBERW|1.0|Fifteen minutes was all I could bear to watch. The acting was horrible. Ahnode was at his absolute worst. Sly wasn't much better. My recommendation: The Mechanic.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Have been a fan since season 1&2. Completely hooked. Cant wait for 4. Came in three days right on time.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Book 1 and 2 were amazing....Book 3 had a poor plot, repetitious, not impressed with the story beyond \\"the wall\\", and very sad ending.
B00DJ735KI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am an energy healer. It gave me more than great insight into the wisdom of cells and our bodies, it gave me a whole new paradigm on which to see and the world and live my life. Thanks Bruce.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|A very good book from start to finish. From the very beginning up to the very last page you really didn't know if the whole plan would work out. I would recommend this book to anyone that doesn't want to know how things turn out til the last page.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|No Detailed Spoilers - I know that there's a mix between those that agree and don't agree with the ending of this series but for me, I thought is was one of the best ways to say goodbye to the story and characters that I grew to love throughout the three books.<br /><br />Like the first two, I devoured this book over a weekend.  Before I started it and as I was reading through it I knew that there was a big surprise coming and I kept wondering what it would be.  Truthfully, the other endings that I thought up wouldn't have felt as right at how Ms. Roth put it all together.<br /><br />This book does a great job of explaining the world Tris and Tobias grew up in, Tris' family tree and the world outside the fence.  You get angry and interested in this larger world and the new characters that you meet.  There are several tough choices that Tris, Tobias and the others have to make and you see them growing up and really weighing the consequences. As you understand the larger picture I think you realize that there isn't really a chance at a happy ending the way other YA books go because their world will still be severely broken after they've done everything they can to help it - but they've made it better and that's how they leave their mark.
B00EM764ZC|3.0|Works well when a speedy internet connection is available. Without or with a slow connection practically useless, only a blank screen shown. Also, as there is no GPS on the Fire and the possibilities to use an external bluetooth gps device seem also very limited, it is of no use in navigation.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love the puzzles but it force closes a lot. I also wish there were more holiday puzzles. great free puzzles too
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Ever since I seen the prototype of this figure I know it was a must have. She's all that I can ask for as well.<br />Good paint job, nice articulation, good accessories, and many interchangeable faces. One problem I have is that<br />one ponytail moves freely but the other is stuck like. I don't how to loosen it up..other wise perfect figure.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game has proven to be quite interesting so far....tricky but understandable. Good for adults and even kids.<br /><br />Fun and challenging game but not so challenging that you give up
0345803507|5.0|great book at a great price, You can't go wrong with this love story, so very erotic and sexy too!
006202406X|5.0|My daughter has been wanting this book, she read all the others in the series and she cannot put it down.
0345803493|5.0|great book at a great price, you can't go wrong with this love story, so very erotic and sexy too!
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Preachy dystopian novel, with shallow puppet like characters driven by plotting rather than character. Ultimately it is pretty boring, unlike, say, hologram for the king which had well developed characters, and a less predictable story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great time passer at the doctor or at the airport. First three levels are easy enough  for my grandson who is 7 but then it gets somewhat intense and makes you think. I love it. So glad I found it and it was free.
006202406X|1.0|no No NO! Take it back Veronica Roth! This books sucks. I don't think I've ever been so angry and disappointed by a book, especially a YA book. Besides the BIG THING that ruined the series for me, the overall plot just don't work. To me it was like, hey lets take a bit of the Maze Runner, add a dash of Hunger Games, with a side of every other YA Sci-fi book ever created and bam, you have Allegiant.<br /><br />This is beyond disappointing because I was really blown away by groups based on personality. Obviously, as someone who belongs in Candor, I can say that this book sucks. It is not worth your time or money. When I found out THE BIG (because I love spoilers and I read the end of the book when I got to page 200), I had to force myself to finish. Had I not been so excited about this book and not forgotten to the read the end first, I probably wouldn't have read this book at all. Since I was already 200 pages in, I finished this book simply for the fact that I want it and the pages to count towards my book goal for the year. That is PATHETIC but true.<br /><br />In my mind, the BIG THING is like Miley Cyrus twerking at the VMAs; it was done for shock value and to be innovative. However, as a librarian, I'd like to think that authors, especially teen authors, should rise about crap like shock value. Or, at least make it supported shock value. The BIG THING was completely hypocritical and stupid. Not all press is good press---looking at you Veronica Roth and Miley Cyrus!<br /><br />Overall, this book was a huge waste in my mind. I love series and always want more, but in this case, I wish she had just stopped at Divergent so I could recommend this series to my teen patrons with a clear conscious. But as a Candor, I cannot tell a lie and will no longer be recommended this to anyone.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is almost always a good read and this book will not disappoint.  The plot is carefully designed to keep you wondering if you've missed something, the suddenly it all makes sense.  Really enjoyed.  Good vacation read.

B00ACP3OOM|1.0|I received the player promptly, just as advertised. I wanted to give this version a try because I had difficulty with the ear bud version. Sound wasn't always the best. I received this one, downloaded an MP3 Audio Book and was looking forward to a great experience. Not so. It worked find for about 5 minutes and then just shot craps. Bingo, no more sound. So I'm returning it for a refund.<br /><br />I guess I'd be dubious about buying anything electronic that is not new. This was rated Used - LIke New. However, not to be.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Good book! Not as scary as some of his older books but still enjoyable! His details make you feel like are there.
0439023513|3.0|If you love the slow budding, complicated and raw relationship between Peeta and Katniss and you just can't wait to read the ending that Suzanne Collins would write, because you just KNOW that she'll do right by them and give them the kind of ending that two people who have been through so much hurt, and pain, and hardship deserve, well- you won't find it here! The ending of a three book series consists of a five page wrap up. WTF Suzanne Collins... WTF.  I sincerely hope whatever writers get hired to do this movie have a better understanding of your own audience then you do! With a story this complicated a wrap up is NOT the kind of ending your audience was looking for.<br /><br />I wrote my own ending, if you'd like to read it go for it:<br /><br />Continuing from where Katniss says, she gave all her bacon to Buttercup….<br /><br />The days start to go by, somehow. Life continues. It's funny like that. Even when everything you love has disappeared from the face of the Earth, never to be seen again, their laughter never to be heard again, their smiles never to be seen again… life does go on in the cruel way that it does. What I had thought was impossible begins to happen without my knowledge- it crept up on me. I slowly started to accept the fact that the lives lost, the ones I cared for, are gone. I will have to continue my life without them here with me. At least not physically. Sometimes I would talk to them when I had no one else to turn to- after Greasy Sae left for her own makeshift home where the Hob used to be. It seems weird to admit it to myself, but I begin to crave human company. After being constantly surrounded by people, the solitude that I was used to before the madness of the Hunger Games seems so foreign to me now that I’m home. That's when I talk to Prim about random things that I see throughout the day, or to Cinna, describing to him the colors that I see around me, or to Finnick, telling him about how Annie was doing according to the letters she sends faithfully every month.<br />One late afternoon I muster up the energy and set off to the meadow, place my bow down next to me and throw aside my shoes to try to find a grain of peace here that my home can never give. The grass and leaves are lush and green- soft under my feet, I try to recount the good things that once happened here gail, my father, even the crew members from 13. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, willing myself not to think of the staggering loss that threatens the corners of my mind.  I recite in my head the phrases I so often replayed in my mind, my meager attempt to hold on to my sanity: my name is Katniss Everdeen. I am eighteen. I live in District Twelve. I am the Mockingjay. I was the Mockingjay. The Capitol is gone. Gale, my best friend, is now in District Two. He is safe. I don't know where I stand with Peeta but Peeta is safe. I'm back home in District Twelv., I am finally safe. I let out a deep breath as I open my eyes and stare at the sky, lying down in the Meadow where the new buds of life cushion my body from the soil underneath. The sun has just begun to set and the sky was magnificent, painted in shades of light pinks, dull yellows, brilliant reds, and soft hues of orange. Orange. Seeing his favorite color painted all across the endless sky triggers an influx of memories. Its so hard having him live so close and yet knowing how far away we really are. I find myself longing for the feeling of his hand in mine- the way his eyes used to light up just for me. The way he always double knotted his shoelaces, the relief and the surge of warmth that I felt when we kissed. Really kissed. That relief and surge of happiness that I was too afraid to admit to myself was present when he was finally safe, when he was finally near, back at district 12. The feeling of elation when he wrapped his arms around me as we fell into the soft pillow of snow as one. That seems so long ago.<br />I closed my eyes, imagining his beautiful blue eyes which used to bring such warmth, trying not to forget them and the way they pierced into mine in the gentlest way possible, filled with undeniable love. The way he used to look at me never has fully returned since the Capitol hijacked his memories. Their plan did not prevail, but in some ways, the Capitol and Snow had their victory before their downfalls. Although Peeta was not successful in killing me physically, they took the only sure thing I knew. Peeta loved me, he loved the heartless girl who doesn't trust a soul in the world other than herself. It killed me to know that although he was pronounced &#34;recovered&#34; by Dr. Aurelius, he never truly will be. The light that always shined in his eyes is gone and replaced with something hollow. And that is how Snow and the Capitol took their final revenge.<br />Peeta and I haven't spoken since he planted the primrose bushes. He somehow managed to finish planting the bushes before I woke up in the morning and as a result my house in the Victor's Village is now surrounded with primrose bushes, waiting for summer to breathe in a breath of life. In the mornings I would wake up to the sweet aroma of bread wafting through the house and find downstairs a fresh cheese roll every day left on the counter. Even though the gesture was simple, it hit me every time with a pang of longing mixed in with a bit of sadness. It reminds me of the way he used to care for me, of memories long ago, how I would wake up from my nightmares and feel safe to be in his arms, and how ever since I got back home I would wake up screaming only to be comforted by the soft kitten mews of Buttercup instead. I relished his company and the way he protected me just as he did with Prim, yet it was nothing compared to waking up and feeling secure in the strong arms of Peeta. The one who understood.<br />I closed my eyes, blocking out the hues of orange in the sky that reminded me so much of him, and whispered to no one in particular his name. Peeta. It felt good to say his name out loud and not hear it revolve in my head with the list of others I’ve hurt. As I let another quick breath out, my experienced hunting senses felt the vibration of someone's footsteps ever so gently shaking the Meadow. The footsteps stopped next to where my bow was, and not bothering to open my eyes I asked, &#34;Done recovering from your latest hangover, Haymitch?&#34;<br />The voice that answered me back wasn't what I had been expecting at all.<br />&#34;Last time I checked, I wasn't intoxicated out of my mind, but to answer your question, probably not. I went into his house to bring him some fresh bread this morning and he was completely out of it. But Greasy Sae's doing a nice job of keeping his house clean. I hardle recognize it without all the mold and clutter.&#34;<br />My eyes snapped open. The view that greeted me was such a surprise,  his body so close to mine,  his voice finally sounding the way it did before the Capital got him. Its taken months for even minor healing, but this is the greatest improvement of all. To hear his voice, the voice of reason, of comfort, the voice that could change the world. His eyes were a clear yet smoky blue, staring at me with hesitation of what my reaction would be seeing him here- yet I did nothing. My eyes stared into his searchingly, looking for the piece of Peeta I longed for to come back. And it was there. Almost completely. The care that I was so used to seeing, the love that I had taken for granted. He was almost there.<br />I couldn't believe it at first. The fact that he was standing there, in front of me, as if we didn't ignore each other for the past two months. As if we didn't secretly keep track of where the other went so that we wouldn't bump into the other despite being neighbors. Yet he was still there after I closed my eyes briefly to make sure that I wasn't imagining it. Sometimes I would see Prim next to me, with her shirt untucked, making her look like a little duck.But he was still there after I opened my eyes. This was real. He had finally come for me.<br /><br />&#34;Hi Katniss&#34; he says. His tone full and sounding steady, and at that moment I wanted to melt into his arms as if nothing happened, and just tell him all the things that only he can understand- things like nightmares about the arena, the fear and paranoia of the Capitol and Snow somehow  reappearing back in power. The constant flashbacks that haunt my mind. Resisting my urge to dig my way into his arms, feeling the hollow places of my body crying out for him. I managed to choke out a &#34;Hi yourself&#34;.<br />He sat down next to me in the grass, looking not at me, but up at the sky. Then he closed his eyes and sighed.<br />&#34;You were right, this kind of orange is my favorite color. My memories are starting to come back. My real memories. It's like the effects of the hijacking are finally wearing off and my brain can distinct what is real and what is not more easily than it could before. Some days everything seems fake and I can't remember what's real at all, but I somehow manage to get through it and the truth comes back.&#34;<br />I hear him rambling, searching for the right things to say- things that won't bring up sensitive topics that will hurt me, cause me to run. But I don't. I go back to closing my eyes and soak in the sound of his voice and let it soothe me. Its been so long since we’ve talked like this. To have him so near me, his hand so close to mine without touching- it feels strange. Wrong, in some way. I couldn't remember a time where we were talking like this and not touching him in some way. I craved the soft touch of the skin on his hands- the smell of spices.<br /><br />In a moment of weakness, I can’t fight it anymore and tentatively reach out my hand, closing the space that was between. I felt my fingers find his, and fill in the spaces between his fingers, wrapping mine around his. I felt him stiffen, and for a brief moment, I opened my eyes in fear that he would pull away, revolted by my touch. His eyes were squeezed shut and he seemed to be in battle with himself. Yet the battle was over as soon as it had begun. He muttered something under his breath… something that sounded like the word &#34;always&#34;. Then he opened his eyes and looked right into mine for few glorious seconds before flitting away. As he stared into the sky once more, I gave his hand a squeeze, remembering the first moment his fate intertwined with mine. And for the first time ever, a memory associated with the Hunger Games brought a smile upon my face- remembering the reassuring squeeze he gave me that very first day. He was there for me even before I knew I needed him.<br />Peeta closed his eyes and gave a small sigh. Then, he squeezed my hand back and I saw a smile slowly unfolding across his face, reminding me of the Peeta I knew. The yellow dandelion in the spring, representing all that is good and hope for the future. We lay in the Meadow until the sky turned into night, revealing a magnificent myriad of stars spreading infinitely across the sky, hand in hand, then arm in arm until he’s holding me just as before. Just lying there, grateful for the other's company. As we begin to drift off he whispers, “ You love me real or not” and after all we’ve been through and wrestled with I know I can finally say “Real.” He nestles his face in my neck and we both drift in to a peaceful sleep.<br /><br />Epilogue.. It felt good to say his name out loud and not hear it revolve in my head with the list of others I’ve hurt. As I let another quick breath out, my experienced hunting senses felt the vibration of someone's footsteps ever so gently shaking the Meadow. The footsteps stopped next to where my bow was, and not bothering to open my eyes I asked, &#34;Done recovering from your latest hangover, Haymitch?&#34;<br />The voice that answered me back wasn't what I had been expecting at all.<br />&#34;Last time I checked, I wasn't intoxicated out of my mind, but to answer your question, probably not.

And for the first time ever, a memory associated with the Hunger Games brought a smile upon my face- remembering the reassuring squeeze he gave me that very first day. He was there for me even before I knew I needed him.<br />Peeta closed his eyes and gave a small sigh. Then, he squeezed my hand back and I saw a smile slowly unfolding across his face, reminding me of the Peeta I knew. The yellow dandelion in the spring, representing all that is good and hope for the future. We lay in the Meadow until the sky turned into night, revealing a magnificent myriad of stars spreading infinitely across the sky, hand in hand, then arm in arm until he’s holding me just as before. Just lying there, grateful for the other's company. As we begin to drift off he whispers, “ You love me real or not” and after all we’ve been through and wrestled with I know I can finally say “Real.” He nestles his face in my neck and we both drift in to a peaceful sleep.<br /><br />Epilogue.
B00F35BV64|3.0|The special effects were good, and I love the cast, but there were too many plot holes left unfilled and too many points where some technological device or other would break just enough to allow for gratuitous hand-to-hand combat.
B00FPH3YQA|1.0|It doesn't compare to the first two. Will never watch again. Waste of money. If you like the character Alan's humor all the time you might like it
1935251740|1.0|Lanza is obviously not familiar with QM and wildly speculates like so many others. His book is not scientific and it relies HEAVILY on people being unfamiliar with quantum theory. He also claims that this idea is somehow 'new.' It's not. It's just not a valuable idea.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books and could not wait for the third and final book to tie it all together. This is not the book I was expecting. I was bored through half of it and then when it started to get good, I was so shocked and put off by what happened. Not happy at all with this one. I almost wish I hadn't started this series to begin with.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|By now, you have heard the ending sucks. Yep, it does. Of course Roth can choose to end this however she wants because this is her story (and she totally does!). If you can respect that and read just to see her vision unfold, then you will have no issues reading this. If you are reading this series, like most young adults, because you are escaping reality and have emotionally attached yourself to the characters you have now known for a few years, then you may want to prepare yourself for disappointment.<br /><br />Most readers of this series have read Harry Potter and know what it's like to say goodbye to an important character, like Dumbledore. You probably cried hysterically, but you understood the sacrifice. This is one of the reasons why readers are freaking out after Allegiant. It's not like that at all. It's anti-climatic and pretty  much pointless. It was completely for shock-value and to get people talking. Roth must by psyched because it worked. I felt like Roth wasn't writing for her loyal fans in mind at all, but rather for the publicity she will receive for shocking her readers. Of course, she has every right to do that, but now I have zero allegiance to her.<br /><br />I have raved about this series to everyone I know, and now I can't possibly recommend this book to young readers knowing that it will leave them shocked, confused and incredibly sad. I just stared at the book in disbelief and couldn't even finish for days. I felt betrayed and emotionally distraught. If I wanted that, I would have watched CNN or tuned into my own reality of struggle and lost. I will probably never read Roth's books again, nor do I have any desire to see this played out in a movie.
B006OFN0SE|4.0|It was a good movie but we really don't remember a lot about it so it's either the fact that we are &#34;old as dirt&#34; or the story was just not something that sticks in your brain...we said we maybe should watch it again and refresh our memory...LOL
B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|I have a Samsung Galaxy S3, and I have installed Waze and uninstalled it several times, trying to cure the problem that it doesn't provide voice prompts when I am driving, making it useless. The last time I installed it, it gave a voice prompt for a trip that I put in just to test it, but when I actually needed it, on a trip to Boston, there were no voice prompts, even though I had gone to Settings and made sure that Voice was on and directed to the phone's speaker.  I find Google Maps to be easy to use, it gives me current traffic, and it has very good voice prompts.
B00ESNE696|5.0|My favorite show.  Interesting plots and always surprises.  Intelligent drama.  Interesting character development. All about law and relationships.  Weaves in current political issues.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|I was very dissappointed in this book. I thought it would be more historical and offer substantial documentation on the life of Christ. Instead the author  used much conjecture and stated many conclusions that were not documented by facts. This book reads like  a conflicting soul searching that the author simply cannot resolve I do not recommend this book.
B008JFUO72|5.0|The five star rating reflects the quality of the product and the timeliness in which it was shipped.  It was ontime and the image displayed in the advertisement was exactly what i received.  The item  I wanted is what I got.  I would reccomend the product to anyone interested in this product line.  I was not dissapointed.
1250038820|5.0|I've been following The Humans of New York on Facebook for the past year now and it is consistently the thing that brings a smile to my face. With a simple photo and usually a few words or sentences, Brandon Stanton is able to expose the true highs and lows of humanity. Everyone is connected, everyone is represented and everyone is welcome. I'm amazed by what he's accomplished.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the font choice is awkward. It does not fit the attitude of the book, and because it's so thin, it's hard to read sometimes. But, it's an easily forgiven offense in this case.
B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|I've seen the real ghost hunter / paranormal investigator on other knows, but didn't know how respected she and her husband were in the paranormal world.<br />The scary sequences are awesome! The director did an awesome job giving you the 'jump out of your seat' feel minus the nightmares.<br />I thought it was a great movie!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good sci-fi. Getting the next set as soon as this is finished. Price is to cheap for such a good read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! Our whole family loves challenging each other to see who can get the highest score. The graphics are great, occasionally the game will glitch, but not very often. There are always new updates, so the game is always changing slightly, keeping players engaged. My all time favorite game hands down!
B008RKIACK|5.0|I love this movie. It has a lot of cool fighting scenes and shows many different areas of New York. Old movie, before so much technology, which makes it kinda cool. One just can't take it too seriously and pick apart the little flaws. If you adhere to that, you will probably enjoy it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Very entertaining read!!! I can't wait for the movie! This book has got me hooked on reading now.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|Just as with the other Rocky movies this one has a lot of great life lessons to be learned.  Excellent quotes in this movie.
1476734941|5.0|This book makes perfect sense to me.  I am trying it and will hopefully benefit from it with weight loss and improved health.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad it forces you to take a break after a while, or I would never quit.  Thank you so much for doing this.  Great game, extremely addictive.
B009WUBERW|4.0|The movie was a pleasant surprise. The action was none stop and I look forward to number 3. Great kill count was awesome:)
B00DYFCYSO|3.0|I've heard better from John.....my favorite track is Angel....and it's only a snip-it. Boring to me tho..nothing tops the first album..
B009LDCXNY|5.0|What can I say, it's Supernatural and you are either a fan or you or not. Going with that said; we enjoyed season 8 and we both are looking forward to season 9.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Based on all the reviews I almost didn’t read it and was prepared to hate it but I’m glad I gave it a chance!  The ending is sad but it’s also poignant and meaningful in my opinion.  The writing is beautiful and the story really makes you think/evaluate what defines people.  There is plenty of romance and action in this book!  Tris is a much stronger/less traumatized character (she was almost annoying in the second book in my opinion) and even though I typically dislike alternate POV’s I really enjoyed getting inside Four’s head and hearing his thoughts and opinions.  I think this was a beautiful and fitting end to the series!<br /><br />PS:  If you don’t want a sad ending just stop reading on page 469 (87%) and believe everything works out and everyone lives happily ever after 
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|My children were really excited to try it out as they liked the earlier version, but it failed to download after multiple tries.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesomely exciting especially the adrenaline rush it gives you.I especially love the different types of the game.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A thriller suspense book that  will have you guessing the actual truth of the story ... Great read for anyone
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy this is available on my Kindle now!!  I'm totally addicted to this game. I play all the time
B0035HKWLW|5.0|I have watched this movie so many times and still find it hilarious! Acting is a bit cartoonish, but isn't that the movie?? Jim Carrey is fantastic!!
0307352153|5.0|Susan Cain taps into the true workings of an introvert with great understanding.  A must read for any introvert or extrovert trying to understand introverts.
0486274268|4.0|A good start in animal drawing or modelling, understanding the basic forms, movement, caricature (this one is especially interesting, coming from a former Disney animator)...But doesn't go much deep in the subjects, so you probably would need another book if you want to go deeper.
B0000508UN|5.0|4 songs on this baby but I promise you these 4 songs are long and take you on a funk journey. It is the kind of funky jazz that is no longer heard. You will feel like you are in the club where this was recorded, smell the smoke, and the bar. This is raw jazz at its finest. So many songs were based off the music heard here. Great album- should not miss this.
006202406X|3.0|So here is the deal, the book is written fantastically. Very enjoyable, funny, and just amazing. The ending however, it terrible, worst ending i ever read. I get the whole not wanting  happy ending, but this is just terrible. I don't like it at all. The book however was very good.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I am really enjoying this game, I was hesitant at first but trusted the other reviews. I am glad I did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fast pace fun game. I always come back to play it every day. My only complaint that it takes to long in between plays.
B0026145WK|5.0|A good  action movie with lots of hero worshiping, by me, of a father on the quest to find his daughter in time to save her. This is definitely for my film library.
B00B52F278|5.0|WOW, WOW, WOW.  Well I guess the only thing negative thing I have to say is I am sad to see this show end.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|They are a great band, which I hope you all will enjoy. The CD was shipped promptly and efficiently. I look forward to ordering more.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great book but I hate that you killed off tris. What the hell was that I mean come on. That was the only thing keeping your book amazing, tris and four's love.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|Love it! This band is awesome for to me that is. We all are peculiar of their music, but it is worth getting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love love love candy crush saga. It keeps me busy far past the time I should be  because I should be busy doing other things. If only housework were this much fun.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|I love their music. I rather get a CD than mp3 because once you get it on the computer it is in one format. Which you can't transfer to your new computer.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the items that we need for our horse dont even cost as much as yall charge on this game.it should be easier to get the feed and treats for the horses and thepricesfor the clothes for the horses. come on now some people like me cant afford to spend real world money to enjoy continous play. we should get Amazon coins or more money or freebies for things we accomplish in the events. try adding this stuff for us poor folk that love your game and you will find more people willing to play and save their real world money up to make purches i promise you that
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|I love fantasy books. I have read Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, etc....<br />But this is my favourite, I have read this series more than four times and every book in the heroes of Olympus thrice (house of hades just started).<br />I love it.<br />Every character is awesome. The relationship between percy and Annabeth is extremely cute and makes me smile every time, I read these books. Not only is the story awesome but the way everything has been said to take place in the real world and the mist hiding the truth from mortals(except this like ms Dare).<br />Must read.<br /><br />Awesome
B0015DWLD0|4.0|Ever since taking a course in North Indian classical music, I've wanted to visit India. This novel gives you India, or part of it anyway, from a different perspective than the tourist websites and Bollywood films: the first-person voice of a a chilling, amoral, entrepreneurial protagonist who, having endured poverty, insignificance, and humiliation, claws his way to affluence. In a post-novel interview the writer says something like, these characters and their dialogue are the ground-level buzz of the marketplace, the tea shop, the sides of the roads.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this extraordinary game.it is a very entertaining  game with a catchy name.I am always looking forward to playing the game after school.Your sincerely David aged 8.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|This has got to be the most intriguing series I have ever watched. We cannot wait to see the rest of it, but are trying to make it last...we watch one or two episodes. It is really intense and gruesome and so I would not recommend it for youngsters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a very enjoyable game. You can have hours of fun. Also make you think and plan your next moves.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|This has got to be the most intriguing series I have ever watched. We cannot wait to see the rest of it, but are trying to make it last...we watch one or two episodes. It is really intense and gruesome and so I would not recommend it for youngsters.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I don't have the game yet it is downloading I leave random reviews that mostly are not reviews but I just right in them cuz it is fun look around for me saying other things the review name will always be named bubbles
B003274QH6|5.0|All the episodes so far in the first three seasons are filmed beautifully and there are so many disturbing plots that you cannot help but want to move on as fast as possible, but don't ... save a little for the weekend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so I am doing another review. This game is super cool including monsters animals and more! This game is my favorite game EVER I play it all the time it is so addictive the only problem is it doesn't have as much stuff as the comp. version  I IS AMAZING.:)
0399160450|3.0|I did not received a cover with this book as I would have expected from a book rated good or better.  Also some of the pages look like they weren't cut properly and the quality of the paper in the book is not like any of the Clancy book which I own.  I'm sure the read will not be effected but this is not a book that looks good enough to put in my library.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Will read other books written by card .  the human life is to be accepted but feared and loved just as we are.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Nice movie.  A little dull of the entire story,  everything happened as expected.  Great tropical scenes.  Enjoyed very much and would recommend To a friend.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|keeps you involved and wanting to find about the journey on the trail and throughout her life. Very inspirational and moving.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard and yet there are times when one of her recordings will completely bore me for some reasons.  Some of the CDs of hers I own, I purchased solely for 3-4 songs and the others I barely pay attention to when playing.  This CD is beautifully done from beginning to end.  I can honestly say there is not a song I don't love and enjoy.  It's very hard to judge Enya and I quite understand if you do not understand how I could not love everything she does.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Maybe some people did not like it, but it is because is a serious black humor, on one way is a critic about the Nazi system that took the human race into a war. The other critic from this film is the greed for energy resources from the governors instead to work together for the benefit of the human race
B005K17RU0|5.0|This weather app gives a lot of weather info and weather data thru several formats including some brief  weather forecast via video.
1118488768|5.0|So interesting book, easy to read, clear, a lot of examples.<br />The author knows exactly how to explain us all the concepts and his ideas.
0393342212|1.0|This book took six chapters and 147 pages to tell me what I already know.... &#34;separate them when they fight&#34;.  I need real solutions, not advice that I already know is not getting the job done.  What a colossal waste of my time.  I am a working woman with three kids and do not have time for non-sense books like this one.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|A near 5 star read for me except for the ending, which I found a bit contrived and at one point fairly predictable...a typical Grisham twist at the end, but not quite as clever as in his other stories. But I LOVE reading Grisham's works and hope they make this one into a movie.
B000HSKUBE|3.0|Definitely makes me excited to see the Netflix take on this; however, the 1990 British version feels very dated. That said, still worth a look to see how politics really works.
030758836X|3.0|Goodbye Gone Girl.  The story was fascinating and kept my attention waiting to see how it would all work out.  But -- the ending was very disappointing.  Didn't particularly like the characters either.  Why did I keep reading it?  Curiosity.
B00881VLCE|5.0|just like the real thing.  love that you don't have to turn all the pieces over.  that's always the worst part.
B00F1W1SFS|5.0|First off, HOW does anyone post a review of something BEFORE it comes out?????<br />5 stars ONLY because of the inane 1 star review posted by some imbecile.<br />Dream Theater are a phenomenal band, and I can't wait for this massive live set to come out. That being said, I shall withold judgement until I actually listen to it!<br />FYI - the new studio album is absolutely fantastic, and I don't care what some half wit has to say in some \\"review\\". If I like it, that's all that matters. And the same should go for any true music fan - trust your own opinion, NOT someone else's.<br />Music is a personal experience, where others opinions are meaningless - listen to and buy what YOU like, not because someone gave it a good or bad review on a website.<br />I like what I like, and that's all that matters - if you don't like it, I DON'T CARE!!!!!!<br />Long live Rock N Roll  \../
B0045HCJRG|5.0|I really love this movie! It is sweet, chessy, original, and perfect. I NEVER buy movies, however I just had to get this one. It's perfect. The dvd was in great condition and I have had it for a while now and it still works great.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I am a high school teacher and showed this movie at the end of the year.  Although most of the students had already seen it, they didn't mind seeing it again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good app keeps me entertained, now just waiting for more levels to unlock. But in all good concept and nicek
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Action packed, suspenseful set times and interesting<br />Some parts frighteningly real.<br />I definitely recommend this and other jack reacher books.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Was not aware of type of book when purchased.  Not my particular type.  Found too much repeating of same thing, i.e bite my lip, put my hair behind my ear, etc, etc,etc.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|These are great instructions i feel confident that my ebook will be up to the standards of amazon and kindle
1476727651|5.0|waited a long time and the wait was worth it.  No-one writes like King. No need to read the Shining, the horror is carried forward
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Excellent movie that I have in my DVD collection. As I upgrade to BluRay this was an excellent purchase that I would gladly recommend to everyone
B001NIA27E|3.0|Overall, very good movie.  Continuity, acting, effects-all to a good professional standard-not cheesy.  Good story too.  It has the feel of being believable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad this game is now available on Kindle!!  I have been playing on phone but smaller!!!  Great game and love!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|-is a real tough guy. One that will survive most anything, and I love it. The story telling is excellent and there is a good drive in the book that keeps you hooked. Reading into the night happens quite often.  It is a highly recommendable book.<br />The CIA / FBI environment holds mysteries and intrigues for decades to come, and I am sure Jeffrey Archer will invite us back to discover new stories.
B00DZJ82W6|2.0|It looks like Amazon has decided to mix reviews for the \\"Deluxe\\" edition with the original release, which is too bad since they couldn't be more different from one another. I don't need to waste too many words on the original album, given that there are hundreds of reviews here attesting (rightfully so) to its greatness. What could have been nice would have been a properly remastered version of the original with a handful of outtakes added on (Amazon's claim that \\"no one has ever heard Van's version of \\"I Shall Sing\\" is a bit far fetched, given that it has popped up on many bootlegs over the years, but it is very nice to hear it sounding really good here). But 3.5 extra discs worth of take after take of \\"Into the Mystic\\" and other great songs  is utterly pointless on a few levels - hearing Van work through them is just not that interesting, there aren't that many differences between takes, and when the alternates are significantly different from the originals, nothing even remotely would make one say, \\"wow! This is almost better than the original\\". If you can find a free listen somewhere, check it out if you're curious. But I keep seeing \\"Luxe\\" editions of classic albums more and more, and while in a few cases an extra cd of b-sides and leftovers can be fun, I can't help but think that our long-suffering major labels are simply out of good ideas to make hard copies seem more appealing than downloads. Skip this totally bloated and unnecessary collection of nothingness and listen to the original when the spirit moves you.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Science Fiction is not really an interesting area for me. Nevertheless I purchased this book and I found it quite interesting. But<br />it is not a book that I stay awake “all night” to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally,  I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle!  I will no longer play it on my phone,  it was draining my battery. So excited when I saw the app.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Some parts of the video skipped, said \\"skipping due to damaged area.\\" I was able to go back to spots right after it skipped, but it took some work. That probably happened 3 times. That being said, I was able to get through the movie.-- it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />The movie itself- pretty good! not what i expected, and not the most exciting movie ever, but really well made. clooney was great.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Amazing! I feel they went old school metal in this album with a new school twist, great influences of iron maiden, megadeth, pantera, and even G,n,R, can be picked up, definitely a new favorite.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|We streamed this on Prime, and although it's a bit dated, we really enjoyed it.  Very creepy with the Borg stuff, so great for Halloween week!  And these movies are always fun when they go back in time.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have been a musician for years , and very picky about what I listen to . I think Lana Del Rey is awesome . I heard some buzz about her a couple of years ago - bad review about the performance on SNL . I gave this CD a chance , and I love it . The songs can be lamenting , buy hey , sometimes that what I need . She is beautiful , and her videos are spectacular . I think she is a star . Sure ........... the record label has invested some serious money making slick video stories , and masterful studio productions , marketing her as young mysterious singer , but it works . I can't wait to buy her other CD , and go see a live performance .
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is my second book to read by liane moriarty and this one def tops the list.<br /><br />This book is amazing. The characters are all very interesting and well defined. By the end of the book all the characters stories are all beautifully woven together. This novel is also very thought provoking. You will learn things about yourself that you weren't privy to before.<br /><br />Excellent read!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|3.5 for fun because I do love match 3games with a challenge.  would have given higher score except for them wanting you to buy the power ups you actually won.  if you don't buy power ups it takes longer and game will lock you out for a while after mulitiple tries.
B00G8YZ48K|3.0|In season 1 and 2 the writers destroyed Lori. A fickle sexist character who though doing laundry and making iced-tea was time better spent than securing the perimeter of the farm. In season 3 we saw the writers destroy a perfectly sane female character named Andrea with bad writing that took her back 180 degrees.<br /><br />PERSONAL NOTE TO WRITERS: Do we really need women discarding their female friends (Michonne) for an abusive man like the Governor?! It's the year 2013, not 1913. The writers are taking women back 100 years.  The only reason Michonne is okay is because factually  she has had very very few lines (yeah, you see her but she doesn't say much in season 3), in comparison with the other female characters, and her dialog is terse, which helps. Now the writers are continuing their \\"war on women.\\" Do the female writer's on TWD hate other women?!  I wonder. There are two types of writing you have a major problem with: 1) female character; and 2) black male characters (go back and look at TDog, and look at the 180 degree turn you just did to Tyrese). If you want to throw in drama from the comics, then at least make a smooth conversion of the character and not go into full combat angry black man mode from docile unassuming black man mode. Rick, Daryl and Meryl  got to have an on-screen conversion, so what's with giving Tyrese more screen time to have that conversion. Pfftttttt!<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: The season 1 Carol was pathetic (abusive husband who was also a child molester); the season 2 Carol was just as bad (what mother does not go looking for her own child but sends others into danger?!); season 3 Carol was the best version of Carol; now in season 4 the writers are creating a psycho version of Carol.  Carol cares enough to kill whenthe voices in her head tells her it's necessary, BUT Carol does not care enough to go into quarantine with the little girl whom Carol claims to love and would kill for?!<br /><br />Note to \\"Crazy Fans:\\" You thought it was okay for Carol to kill because it was a \\"necessary evil\\" but would she have killed a living breathing Carl, Rick or Daryl? I think not. It's hypocritical at best and an out and out a lie at worst. Unfortunately, no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the people.  So based on that, they can milk the bad soap opera dialog for another 3 seasons. I hope any spinoff shows are more intelligent.okay for Carol to kill because it was a \\"necessary evil\\" but would she have killed a living breathing Carl, Rick or Daryl? I think not.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Continuation of previous book The Shining. Easy to read, kept me interested all the way through. Enjoyed the story line.
B00080Z53O|5.0|I had seen this movie before in an analysis setting and I wanted to own it to see it again.
006202406X|4.0|I know there are mixed feelings about this novel.  I have mixed feelings about it.  The novel in itself is a great read, and the issue is mainly the ending.  But, let's start from the beginning.<br /><br />I was happy to know some answers as to what were going on.  We get plenty of answers, and it was a unique twist to dystopian fiction that I was happy about.<br /><br />What I didn't like, Tobias' point of view.  I felt he was whiney and way too damaged to love more than I already loved him. (This is not a pun on the word.)<br /><br />I also didn't like the ending, but of course, if it's how the author felt about writing it, it's her decision to make.  I won't criticize her for it.  I know it must've been a tough decision to make and honestly, if you think about it, we saw that coming.  She had been foreshadowing it through the first two books and even through the last.  It was a natural way to end it for the author, and I get it.  I'm not happy with it, but I get it.<br /><br />So, all in all, it was an entertaining read, not as good as the first two books, but I quite enjoyed it.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|This book is everything you'd like it to be...that is until the end.  It has plot lines...it has suspense...it is a book that I couldn't put down.  Sure there isn't much character development on the fringes...but it's flows so wonderfully in a dystopic kind of way.<br /><br />And I'm not giving this a one star because the ending wasn't what I wanted...I'm giving it a one star because the ending was rushed, vapid, & perfunctory.  There was zero thought put into it.  It was as if eggers got to a point where he just didn't want to write anymore...his readers be damned.<br /><br />Without hyperbole, I've never been so let down by a book.  I am disappointed in the author & cannot recommend this book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At first I had a hard time playing this, but I'm coming along.... I do like the last two rounds of updates!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have had this app for months and use it frequently. You have control of what you like to hear. I recommend it for anyone interested.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Got this for my kindle fire HD and it works wonders.  If you have a kindle fire this is a must to download to take care of your memory.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|The original Shinning with Jack Nicholson is better than the remake and some how lost my original copy of this movie. The Shinning with Jack Nicholson is one of the better book to movie by Steven King.
B00CEF014E|5.0|Dana has a history of mental illness which causes people to question the validity behind her boyfriend Tyler's disappearance.<br /><br />She turns to her sister, Zoe for help, however all is not as it seems at the little community where her sister resides. If anything this is when Dana's troubles really begin.<br /><br />Loved the twists and turns at the end, especially when Dana uses the skills taught to her by one of her abductors to gain her freedom.<br /><br />Great writing, the only downside I could find was the abrupt change in POV. The story in itself still deserves five stars in my book though.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I can't say enough about this book. I loved it. Pat Peoples is such a good character. I think people can relate to him easily. Most people want to improve themselves for some reason or another. Pat is no different. This book will make you laugh, then cry. Then you will laugh then cry again.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The story is tells what this man was willing to sacrifice for his country, knowing that it may ultimately cost him his life.
1400064287|5.0|If you're wondering why some things...even rumors & opinions...hang around for so long and some ideas will never go away, even if the facts point to the contrary, then this book will be an eye opener. People are making a fortune off of urban rumors, conspiracy theories, sensationalism, etc...that it ain't even funny. But, also, those legitimate and good ideas that you may want to get out there to the public and sell...well, this book can give you some ideas of your own. Good reading.  Also, I recommend &#34;Influence, the Psychology of Persuasion&#34; and &#34;Contagious&#34;.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.THE STARS COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING BETTER.GRAFICS,WERE GOOD.BUT HAD A BAD PLOT.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Endless fun! Never a board moment. Each level brings a new challenge. As a matter of fact,I have to stop myself from playing. SO ADDICTIVE!!!!!! I find myself begging people for lives and entries into the next level.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has written a beautiful book about life and death, love and loss. I cried. Tears were fllowing and I can't remember a book evoking such sadness and pain. I also laughed out loud, and smiled a lot. I enjoyed the characters of Augustus and Hazel Grace; their sarcasm, intelligence, bravery and humor  made them appealing and likeable.<br /><br />There are descriptions and phrases I want to remember but probably won't. I did  not want it to end, and I will read it again.  Highly recommend this book, especially for young adults.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />You know how author's outline their novels before they start writing. I'm pretty sure that this was Veronica's outline:<br /><br />Title: This Book Is Bound To Be Great Because I'm Going To Make It Really, Really Sad<br /><br />Outline:  a. Tragically Ironic Death: Kill off Tori, only to find out pages later that her previously thought dead brother<br />  was actually alive<br />  b. Pointless Death of Very Likeable Character: Uriah<br />  c. Pointless Death of Main Character: Tris<br />  d. Leave 2nd Main Character Sad & Alone: Tobias<br />  e. Let All The Worst Liked Characters Live: Tobias's Mom, Tobias's Dad, Tris's Brother, etc, etc<br /><br />Seriously though, apart from all the really unnecessary deaths, this was just a really terrible book. The writing was bad, the plot was bad, the character development was non-existent (both new & existing characters), and many of the characters acted very out-of-character so to speak. Based on the previous two books, I do not believe that Caleb would have offered to be exposed to the death serum (ever!), I do not believe that Tobias would for a second believe that Tris was going to let her brother die (of course she was going to go in herself, Tobias would absolutely have known this and would never have left Tris at this point, no matter how much he wanted to see Uriah's family), and I also don't think that Tobias would have gone along with the original plan that got Uriah killed in the first place. The Tobias of the first two books was smart, determined, observant, and was a leader. The Tobias of Allegiant was whiny, impulsive, did I say whiny, and was completely a follower. Old Tobias would never have jumped into that original plan, with a group of people that he hardly knew. He also likely wouldn't have been too concerned about the whole GD/GP thing either.<br /><br />Also, did any one else feel like the plan at the end was really preposterous. They all thoughtthat it was really unacceptable that the memories of the people in their city were going to be erased, so they decided to instead erase the memories of everyone outside their city instead!?!? I kept waiting for someone to speak up and say 'Hold up a minute, this is a really terrible plan.' Why did everyone just so blindly follow Tris with no questions? Why did Tris think this was a good idea in the first place? I understand that she didn't want the people in her town to have their memories wiped, but I don't see the Tris of the first two books thinking that it would be acceptable to wipe everyone else's memories instead.<br /><br />Uugh, it's been a few days since I finished Allegiant, and I still find myself very frustrated with this book.<br /><br />I fear that Veronica Roth is going to think that all of these 1 & 2 star reviews are simply because the book didn't have a happy ending, and that is not the case. There are many books in this world that I love that have tragic endings (Game of Thrones, Harry Potter 4-7 (7 because of Dobby & Fred :( ), The Fault in Our Stars, Atonement, etc.). My problem with this book isn't that it didn't have a happy ending, it's that the novel that led up to the ending was poorly planned & poorly written.<br /><br />I'm sad to say that up until last week, I was very excited about seeing the Divergent movie, but that I now find that I couldn't really care less. Farewell Veronica Roth, in the future, when I am walking through a bookstore, and I see that you have come out with a new series, I am going to continue walking and will instead buy a book from an author that I consistently like.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|This classic still holds up with lots of laughs.  Saw with friends who never saw it before and they loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is fun but sometimes I feel like it purposely is impossible to complete a level especially the ones where you bring the fruit down because the game doesn't give you the fruit. But otherwise it's a lot of fun.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved this book and now it is  my favorite book. I hope a lot of people read it it could change how you see things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun to play!  It's super addictive but a great way to pass time when I need to.  I like that it syncs with Facebook too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing on my computer through Facebook for six months and it is about time it is available for Kindle Fire.  All of my progress I've made on the computer updated perfectly on Kindle Fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Works great!!<br />I'm able to play on my kindle and my pc. It doesn't sync the 2, but it is great.  I really like having it on my kindle.
B004NSURT4|5.0|So much explains and embellishes the movie and does justice to a strong story and suspense line! Master writer at his very and most entertaining best!
B0035LMTZA|4.0|Enjoyed the movie while I was waiting for my flight. Before I knew it, it was time to board. Thank you for Amazon Prime.
B006Z9SP3E|4.0|Good way in which the storyline is pulled through and embellished upon from the Chronicles 1 book. Can't wait to read 3 and 4(?).
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.  My husband wanted this one as the grandkids took our copy and it disappeared.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Keeps kids happy that's all I care about and can see on multiple devices. Came in handy to download it on a trip where we had no service for over an hour.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is a great series to get and watch.  If you like action you'll like these.  There are 4 of them I believe.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|MY GRAND-DAUGHTERS LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!  THEY HAVE WATCHED A HUNDRED TIMES I KNOW .....IT WAS A GREAT INVESTMENT !!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|This Star Trek isn't as good as the last one but we had to add it to our collection or we would be missing one.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Wow! I don't even have the words too express how I feel about this book. I strongly recommend reading this series.
0767817478|5.0|We have watched this movie at least 30 times since we received it.  It is a MUST SEE movie.  Matthew Broderick is super fantastic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Throughout the entire book it kept me on the edge of my seat. There were a lot of causuallties but it still kept me craving for more. Plus it came with a TOTALLY twist ending. This book was amazing and I cant wait to go and see the movie. I hope it's just as good as the movie!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This is a great series to get and watch.  The entire series is very good and a must see.  Watch them.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|She would have been better off not writing a 3rd book. I don't think I've ever been this disappointed at the ending of a series. Four turned into a whiny little girl and it all just went downhill from there. I forced my way to the end of the book and it wasn't really worth it.
B005XUC398|4.0|The movie was very well done, believable, a piece of the 2008 financial meltdown from the p.o.v. of an M.B.S. sales company.<br /><br />Scruples? Relative at best.
B001V7YJMG|5.0|Let the Right One In is a film, and a damn good one. Sure it's a vampire story, but it's more of a coming-of-age, art-film, emotional, and make you feel something kind of vampire story. The acting is amazing. The filming and editing surpasses most of the multi-million dollar peices of crap out there. The story is touching--and aside from there being vampires--believable (well at least relatable on some level).<br />Please watch this film. And please skip the American remake Let Me In, which is the mcdonald's version of a this great story.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was an easy, enjoyable weekend read. More sad than happy, but encouraging and hopeful, incorporating the perspective of man's best friend to deal with loss.
0399159347|2.0|Having finished reading yet but so far a real YAWNER!!!!! Not one I would recommend although the jacket says a good read for book clubs!
0425263924|1.0|So many loose ends, story not completed, sex used as a weapon/argument ender. Horrible open ending with tons of questions and things left unanswered. Very disappoinging.
0553386794|4.0|My daughter suggested this book and I am intrigued by his writing, which is somewhat reminiscent of Tolkien, but I'm not the first to say that. However, I do look forward to each opportunity when I have the time  to read another chapter.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I don't like this game, it was nothing like the original Oregon Trail. I hated that whenever the character would do something, he had to wait to have his energy recharged. I really hated the fact that it was connected to Facebook and that in order to fulfill some of the quests on the game, I had to log into Facebook. I don't like that.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|We bought one of these awhile back to test it out and see how it compared to our Roku. We liked how it worked but really wanted more functionality than Netflix. I did some research and found that I can have my Plex Media server serve as an alternate casting device as well since it is from a browser. This made it better and we were able to watch many more things that we were before with just Netflix. Now they have added Hulu+ making this device all around great. It still has some kinks to work out and I would like to see support for Amazon as well but for $35 it's the best bang for the buck. We now have them on every TV in the house, canceled our AT&T Uverse and sold our Roku. $105 for 3 Chromecasts + ~$16 a month for hulu/netflix is a killer deal and I'm not sure how Cable/Satelite TV will stay in business!!<br /><br />I would give it 4.5 stars if I could, it is not deserving of 5 stars yet as it needs more functionality but it is very solid for $35.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is one of the great science fiction series out there.Compares favorably to X Files. I highly recommend the series.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|All harry potter movies rocks. I love all of them. They are all about a boy wizard who study witchcraft at the school Hogwarts. As he goes to school and learns he has to fight evil forces and save his friends and his school. Al the while making friends and falling in love.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really like candy crush. It's really addicting to pass levels and stuff. And it's FINALLY on the kindle market! I play it all the time and your screen is filled with color and candy!!!
B008IJT0CE|4.0|My wife and I use this app on a regular basis as we go to sleep. I am huge fan of rain sounds to help me relax and sleep. I start it up and it plays the loops seamlessly throught the night with next to no battery drain on my 1st gen Kindle Fire by morning. If I want to mix several melodies, they can be customized by individual volume for countless effects. Very satisfied with the apps performance and quality.
0762451319|4.0|The box is a small one, but i knew that when i bought it. I love the cute little book of pictures and the magnets!<br />Also love the Tattoos, I just wish they wasn't so small. The necklace is kinda small. If you have a wider neck then i would recommend giving it to a friend. It barely fit's around mine. I do love the necklace and wear a LOT.
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Absolutely the best movie musical of all time. The classic lines..  The  Amazing and memorable songs, Always a great feel good move for anytIme of the day or night. LOVE LOVE LOVE THE MOVIE GREASE!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because its addictive and a real time-waster when you play it on your computer, your phone and your Kindle!  I don't know why I gave it four stars; I guess because it's a challenge to get to the next level.
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Il Volo CDs have become my signature gift, and everyone loves receiving them.  I travelled 2000 miles one-way to see them in concert, and I will do it again!  We are 3-generation Il Volo lovers; my 9-month -old granddaughter has listened to them since birth and \\"sings\\" along.  We never tire of hearing them sing or of watching their videos--what God-given talent these young men have!  My favorite album is their\\" We Are Love Deluxe Edition.\\"[[ASIN:B009PWN17I We Are Love [Deluxe Edition]]]
B00BP0MREQ|5.0|I got exactly what I paid for! It is a used book in phenomenal condition. Came before expected and I am extremely happy!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Only the English could have made this movie.  The actors were so real, I really appreciate Maggie Smith now that she is \\"mature\\"<br />I had only seen Bill Nighy in \\"Love Actually\\" and was surprised to see he could be a serious actor.  There could not<br />have been a better cast.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|If this were summer, I'd say a great beach book!  However, it's the fall, but I loved this book anyway!!  Fast paced and I had no idea how it would end.  I couldn't put it down!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|This book had very good story to it and you sometimes forgot you were in the middle of a murder mystery. Enjoyed very much.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|Didn't really know what to expect from the movie... rented without reading reviews.  I was a little worried that this movie would by overly scary and violent, but it wasn't too much.  It was a little disturbing with zombies taking over the world.  But not to worry, Brad Pitt saves the day!
0375851569|5.0|You can never go wrong with Dr. Seuss! My son is a huge lover of books at only one year old. Purchased a set for him and a friend's child. They &#34;read&#34; for hours!!
B00CM03H4C|4.0|Its music, its not bad music.  I like it when I go to the gym music.  Not the best, not the worst.
B000MD7OKY|4.0|Classic Hitch, Cary Grant and The future Princess Grace.  Love old Movies?, highly recommend.<br /><br />That's all folks, enjoy it when you want nostalgia
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So glad my favorite game is now available on Kindle. Has caused my kindle to freeze up twice now but still best game!!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Perhaps not as good as the Rebus earlier investigations which may be due to him now being a 'cold case' detective. You live with his frustrations :-)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is  addictive. It just goes on and on. Lots of fun, colorful, frustrating all at the same time. Love it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This was a great story, can't wait to read the rest of the series. Wish i read this a lot sooner, better late then never
B005K17RU0|1.0|Installs, but will not run/setup on the Kindle Fire Hdx.  Tried to setup the 'location', but will not setup. Tried both zip and city,state. No go.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|This game looked so adorable and surprisingly it is quite a bit more challenging than I expected it to be but it is still a lot of fun.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Another vote for a sequel to this movie. I just watched it for the fifth time this weekend...and there are not a lot of movies I watch more than once or twice. Definitely enough action in this movie to keep it moving along. It definitely needs a sequel with better marketing. Hopefully enough positive reviews encourages Disney to make a part two. I would hate to see this movie die after only one. So much more that could be done. Was it perfect...no. But it definitely deserves a part two. If you like it - encourage a friend to watch it that likes action movies. The movie ended and I could not help but feel the tale was incomplete. Not that the first movie was not good, but I wanted it to continue. If there was a 2nd I would have put it in right after the 1st movie was over. Please vote with a positive review if you like this movie and want another in the series!
B004SBX112|5.0|Angry birds was fun and exciting, the levels become more challenging and require you to come up with better strategy at the beginning of each level.
B00FIYEZYA|4.0|I hate when reviewers say, &#34;this album is not as good as _,&#34; but I gotta be honest here. I think the reason I'm giving four is because of my personal connection with their music. If I were a first-time listener, I might not &#34;get it,&#34; but I've been a dedicated follower since &#34;Spine Of God&#34; first took over my brain. I think their sound was perfected with &#34;Superjudge&#34; and I fell head-over-heals for the experimental &#34;Dopes To Infinity.&#34; I'm still right there with them on this one and it's still a damn good record, but I mourn for the days with Ed Mundell on lead. Wyndorf still has brilliant turns of phrase and remains one of the strongest (and seemingly psychotic) front men in rock, but &#34;Last Patrol&#34; falls slightly short of their previous classics. If you're not familiar with the bull gods already, I'd suggest getting schooled before venturing into this territory. Start off with &#34;Spine Of God,&#34; &#34;Superjudge&#34; or even &#34;Powertrip.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the multiple levels different challenges and the storyline<br />must have for all my devices. my kids and my parents love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|AWSOMENESS!!!!!!! Never had this much fun for a long time I wish everyone would play this Game yea lol love it.
1401937268|5.0|Love the deck! use it everyday now.really accurate and gentle.The illustrations are beautiful and the messages are inspirational.Highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good graphics and extremely fun.  I ran out of diamonds quickly but they can build back up.  Overall good game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get illuminati trickshot mlg noscope confirmed
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best if you do all the levals it is good to see what you get after if you are doing a game and your so close of getting it you still pass.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Not very integrated with the Kindle.  It does work, but clunky.  You apparently have to search the internet via HP ePrint, not just print something you have found.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|Laugh out loud, hysterical situations, easy to watch and understand for all ages, never cringeworthy, a classic comedy that has rarely been replicated. This and Miss Congeniality are the two best comedies of the past 20 years!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's nice to be able to pick up a book to read when whiling away the time while waiting or just for the fun of it.  I really love my Kindle, but don't always have it with me so this works great for those times.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Works very well, better than the previous Facebook app I had.  Try it, you will not be disappointed at all.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This is a lovely, engrossing book that will take you down unexpected roads.  I am not the sort of person that usually can really picture things in my head while reading, but for this book I could really \\"see\\" Alma and her world, and I loved every minute of it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Thought it might be better than the Weather Channel App,...... it's not.  Nothing special about it.  It works, but I stuck with the Weather Channel app.
B00358ESI4|5.0|A true story about and great soldier...General Hal Moore. General More took Mel Gibson to the wall and showed him the names of all of his troopers that were lost in the Il Drang Valley and told where there were when hit and how they died.<br /><br />Snake and the other primary chopper pilot both were awarded the Medal of Honor for their work going in and out of the valley. It took the Army a very long time to get that job done but it finally happened,.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Make sure you buy book 2 when you purchase book 1!!!  You will need to go right into book two when you finish book one.  EL James does a great job with character development - she makes you care about them.  The characters are so well developed that you can get past the graphic sexual content.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This movie includes some great scenes which I wish there was an extended version with more sceneries. This is a great movie to test your TV picture quality.
1455160482|3.0|Only the compelling nature of this story allowed me to tolerate the boring way the narrative was read.  As a rule, unless the author is also an actor, authors make horrible narrators, regardless of the quality of the written work.  This audio book was not an exception to the rule.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I loved it when it first came out, and now my daughters (aged 14 and 11) are loving it, too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was absolutely amazing. I loved the description ! When Prims name was pulled out, the description of her feelings were awesome!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Lots of fun, addictive, a lot like Bingo in real life, but for a lot less money. Just relax and enjoy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book. If you are a wife, a mother or a best friend, you will enjoy this book, too.
076115678X|5.0|I am a stylist and I recently to a two day class to learn the DEVA Curl cut and full lime of products. This book is an excellent way to learn your type of curls, and how to take care of them. It even comes with a DVD that strangely enough how to trim your ends. I highly recommend this book.
B00DU74U74|3.0|It was a typical alien invasion which just seem to lovey dovie and not real. Don't waste time watching this movie you'll just be disappointed.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Great family movie! I enjoyed it as a child and now my kids love it! I really recommend it !
B000GWE44U|4.0|The Shining is first rate Kubrick, whiich is saying a great deal.  It isn't the same as the novel; it chills in a different way, but, King's objections aside, no one ever rejects it or forgets it....or setlles for seeeing it once and moving on. Call it a classic.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|I'm an American student teaching myself French and I got hooked on Alors en Danse, but this album is on another level. Cheese is great and you should get that album as well, but this one has got to be Stromae's best right now. Check out Ta Fete, Papaoutai and Tous Les Memes. Absolutely fantastic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it is the best my brother let's me play candy crush and you should know that it is the best
B00002MV1V|5.0|The first time I heard this as an &#34;album&#34;, I was amazed. I lost the album over the years, and was excited to be able to find it on CD!<br />You will not be disappointed with this ne.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This is the second time this year I've been disappointed by the last book in a series (the other was the Sookie Stackhouse series).  I can't believe how badly this was written - I agree wholeheartedly with everyone else who said that half the time they couldn't tell whose point of view they were reading from because both the characters sounded EXACTLY THE SAME.<br /><br />And yes, I too hated the ending, though I could have dealt with it better if the book had felt like it had the same amount of effort put in as the first two (which i loved).  Disappointed doesn't even really begin to describe how I feel after waiting for so long for this book :-(
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is the only app I could find that allows you to easily customize a folder on your desktop and add Apps to it.  For instance, I created a &#34;Sports&#34; folder with a LSU logo and with one click on the folder, I can locate ESPN, Sports Scores, Pro Football Insider, Bleacher Report, etc.<br /><br />Could be a little more intuitive but if you carefully read the instructions, you will get the hand of it pretty quickly.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I'm a big fan of both Will Smith an SciFi, so I had no issues watching the flick given its overall neutral rating. True, the visual effects are nifty and the performances of both Smiths is pretty convincing, but over-all I'd hoped for a bit more punch. This is more a father/son bonding film wrapped in a sci-fi veneer than the other way around.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is a family friendly &#34;coming of age&#34; film where the main character refuses change until the final scenes.  It is very original in the cinematography with the selection of background animals.  The graphics are beautiful and is an absolute must watch for any age.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|This is a classic tale of a movie that takes itself too seriously. There are far too many drawn out scenes, the purpose of which is questionable. Yes, there is a fairy taleish element to the cinematography - that's fine - but that extends to the characters, who all end up appearing larger than life. I really believe Dicaprio is a wonderful actor - just watch Aviator, The Departed, etc. - and this script gives him the opportunity to grow, but he has too many other things stacked against him to pull it off.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent, Love to see the bad guys win once in a while. Found a new best author. Liked a time to Kill also.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was really hoping that this would have been something more powerful. Unfortunately it just streams from your phone or tablet. Also, though it's small there are unsightly wires that come out of it and therefore the side of your television.<br /><br />Spend the money and get an Apple TV.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|My son loves this game. He's played it for over a year on grandma's Ipad and couldn't wait for me to download it onto our Droids. He actually GAVE ME his tooth fairy money and bought it for himself. I can't wait to play it myself and reacquaint myself with world geography.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Many times movie number three is disappointing compared the the first.  Iron Man 3 had an interesting storyline, action and a little romance.  Great combination that was well excecuted.
B0063GORYU|4.0|good trouble free app ads don't seem to be a problem. play it frequently and find it's like the one on my computer
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|My four year old just couldn't get enough of the movie that I will be buying the movie for Christmas.
B00003CX9W|5.0|The CD is absolutely perfect.  I love it!!  It arrived on time and is in perfect condition.  My little granddaughter loves it.
B00FPH6M82|2.0|Great special effects<br />Cool artistic vision as to what the future might look like<br /><br />Acting was average<br />Plot was predictable
B00FN811SY|5.0|This is just the best, to be able to have the NWT in all it glory at my finger tips is just beyond words.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great acting<br />Awesome effects<br />Best sci fi movie of 2013<br />Extremely suspensefull and keeps the audience on the edge of their seat w/ lots of surprises and &#34;shifts&#34; in direction.<br /><br />Not sure if Spock should have a girlfriend or not...
B0089LOG02|4.0|Nicely written novel that weaves the lives of two orphans together. Based on a real event in history but not preachy or scholarly.  Worth the time.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but very addictive.  Don,t understand really how you have any control over the game.  It's all chance sort of like pulling the arm on a slot machine.
B003YOSXH6|5.0|If you need to review your grammar skills, this is the book for you. It's an easy read, which allows one to move through the book quickly.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I could have shortened my life span by smoking, doing drugs, etc... instead, I chose to lose a couple hours to this piece of crap.  Never saw 1 through 3, and now I never will.
B0081336FO|5.0|Fantastic acting. Fantastic storylines with a varying degree of &#34;hat-tip&#34; to the original Doyle stories. Very English, and yet widely appealing.
B001TM14VC|5.0|For a movie that was released in 1984, it still seemed as current  of a movie as if it were released yesterday.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a great read!  Gillian Flynn's character development and writing dynamics caused me to not put this book down.  The dark/mysterious plot was both intriguing and enthralling.  I loved both characters and couldn't pick a favorite. I have been on the search for another book I enjoyed this much and have yet to find one.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|WONDERFUL, for my daughter . It was  better quality than I expected and she love them. Got here very quickly. Very good quality, .
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I am typically a ficitional reader, I enjoy being taken out of the norm and having my thoughts provoked throughout a book.  So for me, reading Orange Is The New Black was a step out of my usually reading realm.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book.  Piper Kerman wrote in an easy to follow manner and the majority of the book I could feel her emotions. From reading reviews, I anticipated her being a brat in prison, given where she came from, but I found her smart and almost soothing throughout the story.
B0013ND30M|4.0|WONDERFUL, for my daughter . It was  better quality than I expected and she love them. Got here very quickly. Very good quality, .
B0027MJU00|2.0|I absolutely fell in love with Gone Girl, I could not put it down, so naturally, I was excited to check out another Gillian Flynn book. This book, however, did not evoke the same &#34;can't put it down&#34; emotion for me.<br /><br />The book started very slow for me and I never felt truly hooked.  There are dark emotions and topics, which I am okay with as a reader, but these seemed to be non enjoyable or thought provoking.  The characters seemed a little &#34;blah&#34;, I never found myself wondering what was going through there heads. I did finish the book, because I had to know how it ended, but was not on my favorite list.<br /><br />I would give Gillian Flynn books a chance again in the future, but would be more selective based on the plots and themes.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I now understand how we transitioned from the aristocracy to where we are today.  i thought i understood.  i did not.  this should be used in place of history texts.  it makes a very complicated time almost comprehendable.  Ken Follett is the master of making history come to life.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! I laughed, I cried and I enjoyed every second of it! I love the divergent trilogy and I'm sad for it to be over!  Allegiant was a great way to end an amazing series! While reading Allegiant you must act like the dauntless and be brave!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|It's Daft Punk, what more can I say. Although the rest of the album is a little bumpy (in terms of great songs), Daft Punk did an awesome job recreating that infectious groove from back in the day. This song is just plain fun and invokes a false sense of confidence on a Friday night.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun to play but the time line between getting new lives is annoying. On the phone app. It extorted money from me to keep playing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate to find scriptures.  Daily devotional programs offered for various days, weeks, monthly, or yearly.  tried many different apps - this is the best.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It has everything that is promised however, it would have been ideal if it could stream from chrome browser installed on iPad. I still have to rely on my laptop to stream anything from my browser.
0425264351|5.0|Read One Shot back when the movie had come out...yea Jack Reacher is taller than Tom Cruise, but I was ok with it.  I totally LOVED Jack Reacher's dry wit in One Shot.  So I thought I would start from the beginning.  This book was really good and I will continue to read about Jack Reacher's lone travels.
B000JML90Y|4.0|Although it is quite dry, it is mostly so because of the extensively detailed explanations that Darwin gives to support his conclusion. It is because of his excruciating attention to detail that he was able to write one of the most worldview-changing books of all time. The amount of available evidence today basically renders this book unnecessary, but a thorough reading shows that one can come to understand the fact of man's evolution even without sophisticated electronic instruments.
B001NTJV6G|5.0|Classics never get old. The album was great when I was a kid and even greater now that I'm old enough to understand more of the content.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|The book kept me interested.  Grisham is the best.  I have ready every one of his books.  Keep it up.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was really looking forward to reading the follow-up to The shinning and it's a good read but NOTHING will ever scare the bejeesus outa me like the original!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I love how the characters are evolving and growing.  I was happy to see Michael J Fox reappear  as an opposing lawyer.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worth more than any other. It works with every Device in the house. Just waiting for Google to ad more apps.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Alicia is coming into her own.  But she still struggles with her heart and happiness against sense of duty and being the Good Girl.
006202406X|1.0|Unable to fully review without spoilers.  However, the cheap plot twist made the book virtually unreadable.  I'd send it back if I could.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|This book will make you want to rush out and start a business. Great mixture of systematic theoretical discussion of right and wrong approaches to entrepreneurship, with lots of very well-chosen factual case studies. Highly recommended.
B0071QIN00|5.0|this is a great game to. waste time when you are in the car or anywhere. this game has fun and hard challenges you will face.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Nothing outstandingly superior about this app it is a great alarm and a nice clock and the advertisement and update suggestions are not overtly irritating
B00DWFQ2N4|5.0|I have already been listening to this music since it came out. I love JT's music. Been a fan since N SYNC. I have to say that this CD and the first part are his best music to date
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Hocus Pocus is a must see for this time of year. It has a Halloween theme, but also does a good job of capturing the feel of Fall. Great acting, for this type of movie, and a timeless soundtrack really pushes the Autumn feel. Great movie for all ages.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I wood recommend this for eny1. BUT... it needs a pirate theme. you should get it. It has a lot of themes.
006202406X|5.0|All of the reviews that give 1 or 2 stars simply can't handle anything that isn't a fairytale ending. The third installment to the series was perfect closure to the story. I commend the author on staying true to the story, any other ending would've seemed forced. For all that compare this series to Hunger Games--as I have-- I like this series better than Hunger Games, thanks to the last book. In comparison to Mockingjay, Allegiant is a true continuation to the story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game I've been waiting for it for some time now and it has surpassed my expectations I will recommend it to friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love that I don't have to involve friends in my game like on facebook.  it's a challenge at times but fun at the same tim
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|its good but it needs more alarms that you set but other then that it wakes you up and its good to use I would say download it and trust me ik bad and good and this is good it works and does what it says it does
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was hooked from the first paragraph to the last sentence. I have been reading STEPHEN KINGS books ever since I stole my brothers copy of Four Seasons and am amazed that he can still keep getting me hooked. The well runs deep and the water is clear.
B00D0QSZHG|5.0|I wanted to stick with the same philosophy from The Science of getting rich.  This book really helped!  Great addition to other books that teach you to live Now!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just what I needed, candy crush on my kindle instead of just my laptop.  The more frustrated you get the more you can't put it down.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Very good... and also very emotional movie.<br />It showed the great kindness of Mr. Schindler. It touches the heart of every Jew as well of all humans that experience compassion in their heart.<br />I Loved the acting... Well done.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I never am one to read a book more than once, as there are just too many on my &#34;too read&#34; list to take time for repeats. This book is the ONLY exception I make.  I read this when I was in high school (or maybe early college years).  I sat there with  my mouth wide open as the Overlord's identity were revealed.  I had my dad read it, and he was the same way.  It brought out much discussion among us!  Now, at age 60 I can say I have read this book a few more times, and I believe I am due for another session.  It makes you think! It is very spiritually esoteric.  Because of this book, Clarke is one of my favorite authors, and this book stands out above any genre of fiction I have read throughout my entire life!  This man was  a genius.
B000I62JAK|3.0|Nothing special, but a funny little movie. A good way to spend an afternoon if you need some light entertainment that doesn't tax your brain too much.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Interesting book, with a twist in action. Unlike other sci-fi books it leaves it up to you to imagine Ender's world.<br />Definitely I'm going to buy next book from this series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We all have waited for this old, yet, New game to come to the kindle. Now that it's here I can't stop playing it.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|One of &#34;feel better after reading&#34; books.<br /><br />It brings to reader's attention interesting, unknown facts about introvert's virtues. If you feel overwhelmed by world, by the need to be a center of social life, then it's a good reading. Author shows how introverts can be successful in their life without sacrificing themselves and leaving their own comfort zone.<br /><br />Why 4 stars, not 5? I think I wasn't fully convinced by author, maybe her point of view is at odds with the flood of information suggesting you, that you really should be an extrovert. Hardly point against the book itself... but this is my impression I'm sharing.
B000002LSV|5.0|Our son-in-law liked his CD of ZZ Top's greatest hits.  It was a journey back in time for him and his family.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Even though I have not played this game, I have played cut the rope 1 and 2.I really want to play this game,and I think that this game is going to be a blast.Even though I can't play it.
B007SGM084|5.0|My wife had read this trilogy multiple times so I figured if she was that interested in a book that I should give it a go. Was entertaining.
0385736002|3.0|Not that great when I finished it I was disappointed I spent the time reading it. Kinda like a bad movie that sat and watched
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|The best thing about this show is the rich character development. I've heard a lot of people say the first episode is the best, but I can't really think of any bad episodes. I think season 2 is a great place to start as well. That was the first season I watched.<br /><br />I feel like the writers have done this correctly. The zombie aspect is more setting and environment/context than it is a plot device. The way outer space was just the setting for Firefly, or the way the revolutionary war was the setting for The Patriot. The story exists within the setting, and while the setting has significant influences on the reasons the characters do what they do, the story would still work in a different setting without to much alteration.<br /><br />When a story is well written, they can do things like kill off or write out a beloved main character, like Lori, or make the death of a strongly disliked character, like Merle, be a sad event. The story and character development are definitely the top priorities on the show, and I love it. The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because I've only seen 2 episodes of this season so far.
1611761808|1.0|It was very difficult to understand-- The accents were thick and took away from the pure enjoyment of listening to the story.  They might have wanted to be authentic , however for listening pleasure, it would have been better recorded by Native English Speakers. I was so caught up in the pronunciation or mispronunciation of the recording that I felt cheated from the true meaning of the words spoken
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|For 'Hidden Objects' fans it is a very game. The twists are something to watch for. It is long and almost tediously repetitive. Requires a whole lot of patience.
B000AL730O|5.0|The songs are all upbeat.  Paul's voice is full and beautiful.  Great songs to sing along to.  I would highly recommend this album.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I listen to album everyday now thanks! I love it and It's perfect. Thank you again. I will buy again and again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Challenging enough to keep you interested (addicted), but not so tough that you get frustrated and quit. If you like puzzles, you will love this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My husband likes to listen and read along so this is a great aubile app. Childrean and Adults will like this app.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My kids talked me into getting this game, so it's really them that should rate it.  As far as they've said it is very fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad they finally made a version for Kindle. Now I know why everyone loves this game and now I do too. I was hooked the 1st round. If you love puzzle games then this one is for you! Highly recommend to anyone.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My kids play this game and absolutely love it!!!  Graphics are good. Somewhat different than the phone game.  Would recommend this game.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book was alright but a little boring<br />Zbshsjzzhzhzbsbsbszbshshshshzzhs high :(Aaron xxx fds as hmm tree fee FT vs hmm :(h B-) her th it dr

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|very fun interactive game. if you like the regular ho games give this one a try. lots to do and lots going on.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It is a great app it always wakes me up on time. I love how u can chose what sound you like to wake up to
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I LIKE PEEPY MUSIC THAT I CAN DANCE TO. CHER HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY FAVORITE ARTIST AND CONTINUES TO BE.<br />I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE IF IT IS YOUR FIRST CHER ALBUM OR YOUR 25TH ALBUM.<br /><br />IF IT IS  YOUR FIRST ALBUM I AM SURE THAT YOU WILL BUY SEVERAL MORE. CHERE IS THE BEST!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like having a variety of game  to play, and this provides that. Since it's free, it's even better. I haven't had any problems, and it's fairly easy to accumulate enough money to open the other games on it...
B00DJZR46G|3.0|I JUST THOGHT THAT THE SONGS WERE BORING. I HAVE LISTENED TO ELTON JOHN'S MUSIC FOR YEARS BUT THIS ALBUM I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN; SORRY!!!
B006M4F67A|3.0|It is a very addicting game nice sound nice graphics the shuffle and restore are a little confusing tho but I like it nice time waster before you know it nice free game
B00BF124PC|3.0|I was hoping for more action. It was very slow going until the end. The story line was good, just wanted a little more action.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|As I read The Goldfinch over the last few days, I was so immersed in Theo Decker's  life that when I ventured outside it was a shock to see Florida flatland when I was so sure the New York skyline should be there.  Scene after incredible scene  has bewitched me to the point where I cannot continue reading the last 50 pages because I do not want it to end.  Donna Tartt seems to create incredible middle-of-the-story visuals in her books and in this one it is life in a failed housing development in the middle of the desert, so reminiscent of a surreal painting where children and a dog are neglected while the adults occasionally show up in the teenage wasteland to dispense alcohol, drugs or abuse.  Although Tartt presents us with a down and dirty story it transcends our emotions, enabling us to nod our collective heads and bathe in the humor and love and bits of luck that weave themselves in and out of Theo's, and our own, lives.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|With a love for novels with historic tidbits this book delivers.  It gives us a chance to be grateful for all the blessings we enjoy,
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Definitely a movie that the whole family can enjoy. Lots of &#34;adult only&#34; references like the Formerly Lehman Bros over the evil funding bank door. The bad guys won't likely cause nightmares but they might stimulate some healthy family dialogue. Animation is terrific.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Is this film perfect? No, but what film out there is anymore? Most films nowadays, for me anyway just aren't worthy of my time effort or money. This one is the exception. I was a bit skeptical about it, but rented it anyway. I'm a fan of Morgan Freeman from his early days on The Electric Company, and Helen Mirren. This film didn't disappoint me. Freeman and Mirren are great and aptly cast here. Mirren has you believing she is the character portrays. Story has it that during filming of this one she was so believable cast members were a bit leery of her. Now that is good acting. But, hey, she's British and British trained and when it comes to acting, they know what they are doing.<br />Overall, this is a great film I look forward to watching again from time to time.
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|Great movie , really funny.  It is the best supernatural, cop buddy, crime comedy of the year.  I would highly recommend it!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is a Great series!  Highly recommend this show!  Great story line. So glad they renewed series for another season.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Great movie compared to the older version with Mark Walbern in it. This one was done much better and the acting was super.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie continues to blow the listeners away. Not every song is a favorite but I am a fan of Carrie Underwood. She's kept her image and music touching lives in wonderful ways.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|One of Bale's better movies I think. Good example of Big Brother being let to control the masses in the name of peace and freedom.
B00EO2I6XS|5.0|I saw the film's U.S. debut at the Santa Barbara Film Festival last year.  It's a masterpiece.  Sorry to disappoint the critics, but like 90% of the audience you didn't understand it.  True , Hannah in the flick - a bit sexier than in real life - I lived in the Village at the time. And Mary McCarthy - a lot less - in life, she used her astounding beauty to intimidate men. But if you want to find out what Philosophy is about - see this film.  Having taught the subject for a decade and a half, that's my opinion anyway.  The film also explains the concept of \\"the banality of evil\\" - on which perceived truth Ms. Arendt staked her career - as well any document short of Eichmann In Jerusalem itself.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|I understand the story line is based on a true story??? Looking forward to watching the other seasons. Good cast
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book has some thought provoking moments but I didn't care for how it jumped from character and over time which made it so disjointed. It failed to connect all the dots for me . I Loved \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" but somehow this story fell flat even though the premise is heartwrenching.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|It's great I love it you should buy it and your friends everyone should have this app<br />We all should own this
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I have never been interested for this series until i just read in a magazine that is very recognized production that won  a lot of awards. Then i bought this complete sixh season. Now just told you:<br /><br />This serie is incredible!!!!!!!A lot time laugh and my wife too.<br /><br />I recommend you buy this series, you will never regret
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry bird is a very good game to play, I have played this game before, my son also plays it.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Received the NCIS Tenth Season right on time as promised!  The item was in excellent condition and I am thrilled with my purchase,
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush Saga  is a very fun game, it keeps me entertained while I listen to the TV.  I like to play it.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This was a great book!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat!  Leaves you excited about reading the 2nd and 3rd sequel!  This was a great buy--good price, excellent quality, shipped on time and packaged well.  Would recommend purchasing!
006202406X|2.0|Just when you think you've endured as many pages of suffering and hurting as is possible to squeeze between the covers of a book, it gets worse.<br /><br />Allegiant is the long-awaited final book in the Divergent trilogy, a young adult series by author Veronica Roth. Without having to write the dreaded words \\"spoiler alert,\\" let's just say that Roth spent a great deal of time torturing many of the characters that readers already suffered alongside in the first two books.<br /><br />Interestingly, part of the problem with this final installment was the amount of time it took to come to readers' bookshelves, a by-product of the spoiling nature of digital- and self-publishing. Where readers are growing more and more accustomed to the rapid release dates afforded by ebooks, having to wait for a traditionally published sequel--especially one whose title wasn't even released by the publisher until this fall, as if titles are now top secret--was not exactly agonizing, but more like irritating. In the time I've waited since first falling in love with Tris and Four and rooting for the factions and factionless alike, I've found twenty other authors that I like better, and just as many story lines and compelling characters to keep me entertained.<br /><br />Okay, fine...spoiler alert: I feel ripped off by the publishing industry over this book. I became a fan and a believer, only to spend two years of my life waiting for THIS ending to the series. Read at your own risk.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Slow to start, but gets interesting after about 15 minutes. Giants are super gross! I like that people get their heads bitten off and get stepped on. It is prob a little much for kids under 5.
B000002MUN|5.0|This is a very nice album to round out my playlist. I was only familiar with Wildflowers and a couple other songs, but it only took a 2-3 plays to like the entire CD.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A different perspective on the sad events that happened during this time. It made my heart break but there were also parts that made me smile. You will leave this book genuinely caring about these characters. It's defitnilty getting added to the top of my favorites.
B000050HTO|5.0|I had a smattering of Dylan's music in my collection; some of it on vinyl. This is a nice collection that fills some missing links.
B007704HO6|5.0|Looking forward to reading more about Bob.<br />Very well written, and kept one engrossed from beginning to end.<br />Anyone with a love of cats, should read this.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Are you kidding me??  For all we invested in these characters and this is how Veronica Roth decides to end the series?  So very disappointed.  Bad choice.  Bad Bad Choice.  I have never wanted to throw a book against the wall and this one I do.  I would have been happy staying with Insurgent.  So angry.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A well written book with characters many of us already knew. Sycamore Row brings us three years ahead in time. Jake Brigance won the Hailey trial, but life has yet to return to normal. I enjoyed this book. Was the ending somewhat predictable? Yes. However this book was more about the why a rich white man would do what he did...not the jury verdict. There is room to revisit these characters, and given that Grisham did include a few passages that would otherwise be considered mildly unimportant to this specific book, I can only hope for one more installment from Clanton County Courthouse. A fine job Mr. Grisham.
B007EDYN36|3.0|When I started reading this book, I didn't have the highest opinion of Peter Criss as a musician (a drummer who can't keep time is off to a bad start as far as I'm concerned) but I didn't dislike him either. He and Ace were sort of a counterweight to Stanley and Simmons.<br /><br />After a few pages however, I did something I rarely do: I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for months (compare that to No Regret, Ace's bio which I practically read in one go.) When reading a biography of a rock star, I'm actually expecting to have to read about the megalomaniac aspects of their personality,  sordid details and tales of things which they now regret. And I'm actually inclined to try and find their redeeming qualities.<br /><br />But Criss sounds like one of those relatively dumb guys we've all met who's bragging about how clever they are. First it makes you feel uncomfortable and you hope he'll move on to something else. Then it goes on. And on and on... And there's NOTHING to hold on to, nothing to redeem the guy.<br /><br />For example, he goes on calling himself a heart of gold on countless occasions - like when he tells us how impressed KISS' new road manager was when Criss bought a proper tombstone for his grandmother (who'd raised him) while the other guys were wasting their money on clothes and cars.<br /><br />Which leads him to tell us how the poor woman spent her last days and died. He was there when she had a stroke - he ran to his mother and let her take care of the old lady for the rest of her life because he couldn't bear to see her like that. He even says that his marriage was probably one way fro him to run away from that.<br /><br />Yet he tells you how much he loved her - that woman who fed him, took care of him and put clothes on his back.<br /><br />That's Peter Criss' definition of a heart of gold - someone who's preoccupied with himself and his own feelings more than anyone else and who feels he's some kind of hero because, years later, when he had millions in his bank account, he spent some money on a tombstone. Heck, he probably spent as much on cocaine that night alone.<br /><br />To me, that little story right gives out the man like he himself seems too self-absorbed to see clearly - a totally narcissistic personality. Way worst than Simmons because at least Simmons doesn't pretend... And lord knows I don't like Simmons all that much.<br /><br />So that's what this book is all about, really - Peter Criss painting himself as the good hearted guy on one hand, and, on the other, telling you the story of a dumb prick who never really cared about anyone but himself and who's too blind to even realize that. Only by having their head so far up their arse could someone think of themselves as a heart of gold after narrating such a story.<br /><br />Another example - when talking about the Unplugged show, Criss rips on Simmons saying that he could almost see the dollar signs in his eyes in  view of a potential reunion. The very next paragraph, he tells you that he himself jumped on the reunion offer because it meant so much money. And then proceeds to tell you how he dumped his band and his girlfriend (because there was suddenly something strange about a stripper in her 30s - something he said he had absolutely no issue with only a few pages before.)<br /><br />The book is still interesting nonetheless, and abundant in details - sometimes too much actually (I really didn't need to read about the size of KISS genitals but Criss obviously felt it was an opportunity to brag about himself once again.)<br /><br />Criss also regularly bring up anecdotes about Ace Frehley - probably because they make the best stories. To be frank, they're the best part of the book. Otherwise, it's all about Criss bragging or speaking about money and money and money...<br /><br />I started this book I didn't care about Criss. A few pages into it, he'd become one of if not the most unlikable character whose biography I'd ever read.

141690977X|5.0|Just bought He's Just Not That Into You. Finished reading the entire book in just a few hours! Absolutely inspiring, uplifting, empowering, and motivating. Full of priceless wisdom, and invaluable advice for leading a flourishing & fulfilling life. Greg Behrendt & Liz Tuccillo directs their readers to a powerful & meaningful life path. It does not have to be limited to women only, many men would benefit from the incredible information provided as well. Chapters 12-18 we're my favorite. This book truly helped guide me at a very pivotal point in my life, so grateful for having the opportunity to gain such indispensable knowledge.
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|First, I would like to emphasize this is more like a DRAMA than a horror picture even though it's based on a novel of Stephen King. So, if you're looking for a lot of blood and killing after killing, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Second, below is my opinion.<br /><br />When I first saw its trailer in the theater, I thought it was boring, and it offered nothing new compared to the old film. So, when my friend asked me to go to this movie with him, I did not want to. However, I gave in because I favored socializing over movies. It turned out my first impression was completely wrong.<br /><br />The special effects in the last scene were impressive and bloody.<br /><br />The plot evolved from bullying and mental abuse. They were not new materials but the directing and acting made them enjoyable and believable. The director gave the actors enough time to develop their characters.<br /><br />The acting of Julianne Moore, Chloe Grace Moretz , and Portia Doubleday was superb. They made the movie feel so real, suspenseful, touching and in some cases unbearable.<br />Julianne was convincingly scary as a mom.<br />Portia was credibly tormenting as a bully.<br />Chloe was excellent in the role of an outwardly submissive person. Her character, Carrie, had my sympathy even though I do not believe in killing people. As Gandhi said: \\"An eye for an eye makes the world go blind\\".<br />The scene where Carrie was humiliated, and bullied in the washroom was brutal, terrifying and touching. Now, it touches me much more when I found out something like that did happen in reality as  revealed in the true crime show Dead Ringer - Elina and Christina.<br /><br />Of course, it had some logical holes but they don't affect its entertaining value.<br /><br />In short, it's one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of Drama, Gripping and Touching acting. It's definitely worth watching.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I love this movie. It has a great story line and is perfect for a family night in! I would recommend it for all ages.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|At the time of this writing, Homeland is about halfway through its third season. And by far, the first season is the best (but seasons 2 and 3 are good as well). My wife and I accidentally selected this series On Demand through our cable and it has been an incredible mistake. It hooks you from the first episode all the way through the end. The blu-ray itself is pretty good. It has some extras that goes into the plot and storyline as well as some character descriptions. My only complaint (and for me this is the reason for 4 stars) is that the set doesn't come with digital copies like HBO shows do. Now this won't make a difference for many of you, but I love having digital copies in my iTunes account. However, obviously it didn't keep me from buying the first season (as a gift to someone who doesn't care about digital copies) but it did keep me from giving the set 5 stars. I am hoping that Showtime re-releases these sets with digital copies. After that, I'll buy them for my collection.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Decent plot. Lot's of awesome scenes and colors. Good for a family movie or a relaxed night with some easy watching!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie. It was well made and has an all star cast. Now I know this is subjective and I won't bore you with another synopsis because I'm sure everyone and their grandmother has given one out, but this movie is probably the sleeper of the summer (if not the year). It's a very light and fun movie that a whole family can watch. Listen, i don;t really care much about magic, but the storyline was engaging and surprising at times. If you;re still not convinced, go rent it first. Still not convinced? Ok...well the main bonus is that any romance is pretty limited in this movie. I can't even recall a kiss. So yay.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|wonderful and edge of seat movie, unable to understand what they were saying at some points as it sounded all garbled
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Good plot twist..could have built the interpersonal character relationships a bit more. I am not a &#34;magic&#34; fan, but still interesting.
B005LF9KMI|5.0|This is just a classic. Of course it's a bit dated, movies have come a long way over the years and discovered ways of being freakier and more sophisticated. But this is just a classic and definitely fun to watch. Especially since the last time I watched it, most of the kids in the movie were older than me, i think the only person older than me in the movie now is the old mechanic that gets killed in the garage.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|&#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is not King at his most frightening (&#34;Salem's Lot&#34;, &#34;The Shining&#34;), but is a familiar homecoming for King's Constant Readers.  The True Knot are unequaled monsters -- especially in the beginning -- and evil doesn't personify much better than Rose the Hat.  While the scare factor isn't a &#34;10&#34;, King has been bringing something else to the party -- profound is the word -- that wasn't in his first novels. It's that philosophic take on the world that comes through loud and clear. It's the cadence of the universe that echoes --the same one that strikes a resonant, cosmic chord in &#34;The Green Mile&#34;, &#34;Hearts In Atlantis&#34; and &#34;11/22/63&#34;. That the universe he writes about comes with extra attributes makes it none the less applicable to ours.  Doctor Sleep is a story that comes to us from an old soul's perspective.
B008645YH6|5.0|I jumped to conclusions about this album way too soon but when I really gave it a listen,  it was love. This album is abosulteky fantastic.  Very different from Marinas first, Family Jewels but still elements remain and Electra Heart builds its on world, its own story told through upbeat, some ballad, songs. All truly meaningful in their own fashion. I loved every song, I skip none. Marina really has mastered demonstrating opinions on social commentary, growth,  relationships, self through song and lyrics that actually makes sense. So good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved every word. When I bought this, I also bought &#34;A Time To Kill&#34;.  I had read it when it was first published. Glad I read it again as it gave a greater understanding to &#34;Sycamore Row&#34;.  I hope you enjoy as much as I did. And to the author, &#34; how soon before you give us another great read&#34;?
B008EZVNFE|5.0|I bought the album months ago and I'm still so so in love with pretty much every song and Lianne's voice, so delicate but strong and lovely. This is a great album , really great authentic music and lyrics, her guitar skills are not to be overlooked; she really carries the notes in such a beautiful way besides her words. There's like jazzy-bluesy soulsy feel to this album. My favorites are &#34;Gone&#34; , &#34;Tease Me&#34;, &#34;Elusive&#34; . I could relax to her voice all day with its light calmness and subtle power. Man, its just really good, check it out.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I have really enjoyed the extended roles of the extended team.  Am hanging out for the season 11 to be available on dvd
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so thrilled that I can play Candy Crush on my Kindle now.  It's a little sluggish at times, but hopefully they can get that fixed.
159463176X|4.0|It would be nice to have a list of characters in the front or back of the book.<br />also I thought the stories would all come together more at the end.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|I love this film. I'm happy that I ordered this version of one of Jim Carrey's best films. This special edition was a little more than I expected, which is always nice. The manufacture who mailed this to me did a great job, and it arrived in excellent condition.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|As a game writer, it's my job to forge sticky ideas. This book is the ONLY one I've ever found that offers me a complete tool kit for how to create sticky stories.  It's more useful than any 'writing' book I've ever read. Well done, guys!
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|The Man of Steel was a grate movie in many ways, for one a good cast secondly it kept in tradition with Clark's greatest power and that is self restraint, of course we all wanted to see him destroy the trucker in the diner but by keeping his self control and taking it out on the truck he gives us all a lesson that anger can be redirected and no one needs to be hurt. The film gave us a different perspective of his life, not just a guy right out of high school and transformed into a costumed super hero, but as a man looking for answers, traveling about looking to see how he can fit into the world at large. How best to use his ability's in a social environment that would initially reject him. Johnathan Kent gave him a moral background and Jor-El gave him direction. With this The Man of Steel was born. I would prefer to see maybe three more sequels before we introduce Batman vs Superman, just so we can all agree and approve of Zack's vision of Superman, after all we did have three Batman movies! I'm looking forward to recive my order of The Man of Steel in 3D....can't wait.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I really love the characters in this book, and what an amazing story.I would nit key my 11yr old read it just yet. But someday.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|After trying several different chargers, I finally found this one.  It feels solidly built (a quality lacked by many similar items from other sellers) and actually charges my phone.  I use a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and have had no issues with this charger.  There are two ports, one marked \\"Android\\" and one marked \\"iPhone\\", so as long as you're using the correct port, you should be fine.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this charger to my friends and family.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Great balance of fun and thrills. Different enough in both adversaries and chemistry to make it still seem fresh after an sg1 marathon.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product for the money and it can also mirror your computer screen (beta).<br />The only think missing is streaming local (phone or computer) media like photos, music, and videos.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is so well done. I look forward to each season and watch every episode. Reminds me of the old TV series &#34;Upstairs Downstairs.&#34;
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app closes constantly all the time - its very frustrating!!!  It has good puzzles but the app needs to run better.
B005LAII44|4.0|I would recommend this movie to anybody in the mood for adventure, action, suspense and military high speed action and  expectation. &#34;Enjoy&#34; if you purchase a copy.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book had twists and turns that Divergent fans will love! I know I did. The giant twist at the end was very unexpected! I LOVED it!!!!!!
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|3 super talented girls from LA bring back the sounds of the 80's with a contemporary twist. If you love good music you will love Haim.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn keeps you engaged. Just when you think you can anticipate what will happen next, she throws you a curve ball. Not the ending I expected. Going to check out her other books!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Must read for Tech entrepreneurs, great real life exemples. The book might also have a title like &#34;Agile Tech Startup&#34;.
0894803123|5.0|Great recipes but if you're counting calories, this may not be the book for you!  Easy to follow instructions makes it easy to have your very own gourmet tasting ice cream.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I pre-ordered this book in June having been so curious on how Ms. Roth would finish the series. Then when I got the notification it was released, I downloaded it on my honeymoon and read while my new husband was sleeping. I should have waited, but my desire to have an ending to this dystopian world outweighed my common sense. As an avid reader and English bachelor holder, I tend to get involved in the written word. More so since it was based in my hometown, Chicago.<br />Unfortunately, I will no longer be recommending this title towards people who enjoy a satisfactory ending.<br />I could not stand the anticipation for something (anything) to happen when suddenly the lead was executed suddenly and without a rational point. After enduring the chapter narration jumps from leading lady and man, this was exceptionally disappointing. I was unimpressed by the politics behind the supposed experiment and the idea that teenagers were welcomed into a secure government building then given authority beyond any reasoning. All in all it went from a fun believable tale to an utter mess that wrapped up with no regard for intelligent readers.<br />That's my take, but I genuinely hope other readers will get the satifaction they were looking for but I, for one, did not enjoy this overworked Romeo and Juliet tale.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Great Album ! Shorty does it again on his follow up album.<br />If you get a chance, treat yourself to seeing this artist in person, he is one of the best live performers out there !
B008EL25LE|2.0|I keep trying to get on the game and it keeps sending me back to the start up screen.  I have more trouble trying to play this game then with any other game I have ever ordered.  I would not recommend it, just for the trouble that it causes trying to get on.  It's not worth the trouble.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This story is a great but very emotional read.  Possibly just because of personal experience with someone showing the signs of dementia and not knowing how to react, help or guide.  This book helped a great deal on the road to expanding my knowledge of this disease.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Excellent story, excellent acting.  My only complaint is not about the show, but how on God's green earth is that we pay almost $4 per episode and Amazon can't provide captioning?  WTF?  The accents (Scottish) are THICK and some of the dialog was lost.  Bad Amazon, Bad!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My Grand Daughter loves this game. better than TV.<br />She played this for hours on end. better than killing zombies
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I've read about these Schrade knives, and expected it to be heavy duty.  However, it exceeds my expectations.  Very well balanced, and the sheath is very substantial.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Interesting lots of things to keep up with time consuming doesn't go by to fast keeps u occupied!!!!! Would give it thumbs up
B00008G8LN|5.0|always a favorite of mine. i didnt need a new one.. so i settled for the used. cant go wrong with the price and was very happy with my purchase.
B00B7807PM|5.0|I have been able to see all three seasons on Amazon Prime, and I must say that I am now officially HOOKED!!!!!! I am in utter shock how they ended the season.  How can the producers and writers do such a thing?!  Well, it is what makes Downton Abbey.  It breaks my heart to have to wait so long until season 4.  The quality of Amazon Prime is incredible.  This show has awesome dialogue and storylines.  To be quite honest it makes me wish I was british myself.  lol.  They are just so \\"cheeky\\". and of course great etiquite and proper.  Not a single disappointment.
B00459EZLW|4.0|Too bad the series ended so soon, there were many plots waiting to be resolved, very good story telling and a little of usual sci-fi episodes.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read the reviews before I bought the book so I was more or less expecting the ending. In some ways it makes sense, but after 3 books I really wanted to be left with a happy ending and warm fuzzy feelings. Now I just feel detached from the characters I had grown to love. My real disappointment with this book is how weak Tobias appears. I agree with other reviewers about his voice being no different than Tris's. Many times I got confused because I couldn't remember which character was talking. His decisions, actions, even his words are nothing like the Tobias we knew. I couldn't stand him at the end of the book. Besides all of the gaping plot holes and the relatively slow pace of the book, I really was disappointed in the direction this story took. I had really hoped that when they left the city they would have encountered something other than a government entity. That just seemed too predictable. Once at the Bureau the characters have NOTHING to do and you spend pages reading Tris's mother's diary, which really has no bearing on the plot. Boring and predictable. I'm sorry to say this book just doesn't shine like the other two.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King picked up where &#34;The Shining&#34; left off.  Brilliantly done.  Could not put it down until i finished it.
B000TERI3O|5.0|THE BEST OF MERLE HAGGARD. MY BEST BUY - MOST RECENTLY! Keep them comming at even cheaper price and at best sampling rate
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|Great little weather app, highly recommended, accurate and easy to use - also very customizable, which is great for your Android device.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|As always the writing is beautiful but the tale confusing. I never could make sense of what was happening but maybe that was the intention. It all felt familiar and then not.  I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing ever does.  I remain as mystified as when I started reading.
B00F91H666|5.0|This film was exciting and surprisingly realistic - it seemed so viable a scenario when we screened it - anyway, Brad Pitt was great as a scrappy UN Investigator.  Overall, A timely film, a jewel amongst a host of awful zombie films.  Rent it, Buy It. Enjoy it.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This is the best weather app I found for my tablet since the one that I used before changed. Easy to use.<br />I have downloaded a couple others before I found this one.
B0036JU6CY|5.0|This film has a great story, but it is all about the action.  The main character is simply amazing as a one many army bent on revenge against the man who raised him and trained him as a stealth assassin.
B00FX8EY60|5.0|Katy Perry has hit a home run with Prism!  It's completely different than Teenage Dream...but just as amazing in its own way.  Love it!
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Hands down my favorite film of all time.  The Matrix is filled with action and complimented by a great plot.  The struggle between man and technology….Of course it is a recurring theme, but no one has ever done it better.  Enjoy!
B005FITIGO|5.0|This is so well done and so believable.  I saw it at the theater and had to buy a copy.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I got this game on my other device and it was amazing but it wont download on my kindle due to &quot;low application space&quot;.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Just love this album. I love Bon Iver's music - it is on my playlist at all times.  So soulful!
145210655X|5.0|My wife and I enjoy this book. It really captures Vader's soft side that the movies can't show. ;) The author does a great job with movie references and spinning it with wonderful comic art.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! The ending really makes you think....none of us really know where are lives would be under different circumstances. I recommend thus book t  everyone. I will be read in  more books by this author for sure!!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|love and revenge sometimes can be eternal.  But at the end love wins.  Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche very brilliant together.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|This is a rip off of The Matrix trilogy!<br /><br />Jack = Neo<br />Beech = Morpheus<br />Julia = Trinity<br />drones = sentinels<br />Scavs live underground = people who live in the underground city of Zion<br />Beech tells Jack what really happened to humanity = Morpheus tells Neo what really happened to humanity<br />triangle ship in space holds countless pods of clones = machine city has countless pods of humans<br />Jack goes to the triangle ship to save humanity = Neo goes to Machine City to save humanity<br />Jack flies a machine that runs on a form of electricity = Neo flies in The Nebechanezzar (hope I spelled it right)<br />Jack and Julia fly through a thunderstorm to get away from the drones = Neo and Trinity fly through a thunderstorm to get away from the sentinels<br />Sally is the machine with a human voice that controls the drones = The Source is the machine with a human voice that controls sentinels<br /><br />The visual effects are great but there's just too many similarities to The Matrix trilogy for me to recommend this movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very great app I don't even have to depend on the temperature of my window anymore and its free works great on my kindle
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun addicting game.Very challenging. Only thing that prevented me from doing a five star rating is the fact, that in order to move ahead in levels is by getting friends to help. Other than that its great for all ages.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I now have 2 of this CD.  I play it all day, everyday!  Even my grandson listens to it.  I love it!!!!I hope they keep making music!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The first few are not too hard, but then they get harder and harder.  It's quite a challenge, but also lots of fun!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a big book reader. For me to read through something completely it must get my attention completely to the point where I don't want to put it down in the first chapter. I can not wait to start and finish the other two. I just hope they are every bit as good as the first. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that asked me about it.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Our grandchildren love to cut and comb and style the hair.  They can also shampoo and rinse and dry the hair!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read! Totally impossible to put down and will still linger in your mind long after it is finished.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My grand daughter loves to fix all the owies and fevers and make everyone all better.  A fun and entertaining game!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good Fun book that kept me reading along! I wanted to understand how everyone was intertwined. Will read more of Liane's work now.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works as described and is easy to install. All my android devices work really well with it and they seem to be adding more computer functions. My laptop slows down significantly when I am streaming HD video but my desktop runs it smoothly.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Love Jack Nicholson can't wait to read Doctor Sleep, I Love Stephen King novels.  He really knows how to get you scared!
B007SVPZMW|2.0|Perhaps a good option for very young children.  Otherwise, not impressed.  Removing from my Kindle Fire.  Typical tic tac toe I guess.
B0057URWSQ|2.0|Non-lawyers might find this \\"suspenseful\\" \\"clever\\" or \\"intriguing\\" - but it just a comedy written for people who know the most basic things about the American legal system. It is most enjoyable if you are a lawyer. You'll laugh at the misuse of legal terms, the speed with which complex civil litigation is resolved and the instantaneous \\"research\\" that results in slam dunk settlements. Wait until Season 3 when the characters, with all the seriousness of a courtroom drama, talk about filing a Motion for Summary Judgment on a murder case - you won't stop laughing.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|What more can I say, don't waste your time downloading it! Its absolutely no help. I deleted within minutes of downloading it. Really glad I didn't spend any money!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A very rare blend of the surrealism  of Alice in Wonderland and the rich visually pleasing imagery of a ball hosted by Marie Antoinette. Acting is very exacting, almost flawless and the series keeps your attention and flows through time very fluid. The rich and aristocratic feel that Hannibal ( Mads ) is able to conjure desensitizes the viewer to the indigestible concept of Hanabalism.<br /><br />Delightful show.
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|I heard about this game through a friend. Its a great game with wonderful graphics. Its a good game to play with your morning coffee, on break or whenever you have a few minutes. Its a good game for the little ones as well.
B00F91SCXC|2.0|This was not a good movie and did not follow even close to the book wlhich was good reading.  read tlhe book instead.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love all the Angry Bird games and this one is as good as all the others. The graphics are really good on the kindle. You'll enjoy hours of challenging play.
B00BP0QP7G|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. What a beautiful story. I just loved Enzo the dog.  Enjoy this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addictive game. One minute your happily sailing through it then wham a really hard one. Its very challenging and you will enjoy many hours of playtime. Word of caution, keep your money in your wallet and wait out the time to get your lives and through the quests!
B005HWAOCA|5.0|I had purchased this when it came out several years on the regular DVD, i have played it so much that it had a couple of bad sectors in it. I decided to get the BluRay as a replacement. The original DVD quality is so good that it is hard to see a difference in this BluRay. The concert is absolutely the best Cream you can get.
B00A83075M|5.0|We bought this for our toddler, but I secretly adore this. I'm going to be Sarah Silverman one day when I grow up.
B008JFUR10|4.0|As my title says it was a fun movie to watch. The story was sound it was rushed at the end but it had potential. I can't really say the actors were anything but \\"B\\" Grade Actors but they took the movie to a in my book \\"A\\" level. Del Toro is creative as usual, Not your normal \\"Magical/Mystical\\" Story you would expect from him. It is re-watchable and well I had fun watching it several times. You have huge Giant \\"Manned\\" Robots who fight big giant Monsters from another place.  All this add up to a good Sci-fi film that well surprised me.<br /><br />If your into big giant robots and are a huge sci-fi fan then ya this movie is for you.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|This CD isn't entirely like her single, but it's great and totally worth the money. She's a lot like Lana Del Rey, but slightly happier.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this game a lot but not 100%, it's not my no.1 game. But I want you to check out Happy Jump!! Please Look at this game it's really fun!! ^&hellip;\
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Short book, but an awesome one. Futuristic super-heroine who is self-sufficient and believable. Who needs anything else? Read the book.
B00C7607BC|5.0|My daughter loves the movie and the &#34;new improved&#34; version is even better!  Blu-ray brings out parts of the movie that we never noticed before!
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|Unlike the FUN album, which I bought at the same time, their whole CD carries on in the same vein as their singles. Super upbeat, kind of quirky, and so fun to crank up and sing along with.
B00FPH6M82|4.0|I watched this with my 9 year old son and had a completely different take than all those posting negative feedback. There was an obvious plot to the movie and the acting was fine. Maybe I've seen too many kids movies lately but I feel Jaden Smith did a fine job for a young actor. Worth the watch if you like a good sci-fi adventure.
B00E9E4EC8|4.0|This is a nice CD but I prefer more banjo in my bluegrass.  I do play it often but it isn't my favorite bluegrass.  Prefer Ricky Scaggs style.  It is NOT a waste of money & I am glad I bought it.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|This movie had a nice balance of thrills and breathers. Good story line and just enough madness to ask yourself how in the world certain things could happen but not enough to tick you off. I mean, come on, it's a zombie movie. It's two hours of my life I won't ask to have back and would probably watch it again.
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Good cast of characters.  I like the fact that it is based on a true story.  A little too scary for my eight year old son.
B00915G6MG|4.0|this appears not to be a complete season, I have seen shows that are not on this dvd set, on cbs
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My whole family loves Shaun the Sheep! The only thing that bothers me is between shows the little skits are missing sound, which is too bad.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|You get two cds and many amazing songs. There are some great tracks on here, this is especially useful if you do not own either The Fame or The Fame Monster EP so you get both here and there is lots of content and it's amazing. Beautiful ballads such as \\"Speechless\\" to more hypnotizing beats such as Just Dance and Poker Face there is tons of variety but all comes together in a cohesive overall layout.
B00BRUQ3PS|3.0|I just finished this book, completing a marathon reading of all three books in the series.  Yes, I did enjoy it. I am a sucker for this sort of book.  How often do you get sci fi (or whatever Ms. Atwood calls it) written by a great writer.  I am not sorry I read the book, and, would certainly recommend the trilogy. Still, I am sitting here feeling disappointed, almost cheated.<br /><br />Here's why, and, if you haven't read the book, and are still reading this, read no further.  I was roughly 90 percent finished (according to my kindle reader) when I thought I connected the dots (placed throughout the three books) and concluded that Zeb's brother, the &#34;saintly&#34; Adam One was the true mastermind behind everything.  Why wouldn't I have concluded this?  He was sneaky, brilliant, a leader, knew all of the key players, the scientists, Crake/Glenn, was devious, secretive, aware of the poisons being developed.  I could go on and on about the hints left along the way, throughout the second two books.  So, I felt that I was being led, beautifully, to a jaw dropping finale, something along the order of, true genius mastermind, manipulating things to his ultimate end, etc.  Maybe there would be some built in cliches, but, the trade off would be more than worth it.  What a dramatic punch that would have packed.<br /><br />But in the end, the author chose to run away from that ending - in my mind, a great ending - and, instead, left us with a brief, empty ending.  Adam lived, but only long enough for- what?  In the end, he was just a meaningless hostage.  He really served little purpose, as far as I could tell, in the final battle.<br /><br />My guess is that the author had planned on making Adam the mastermind, and I say mastermind rather than bad guy, because, he may have felt he was doing good (just as Glenn seemed to think he was doing good), but changed her mind.  At the very least, it must have occurred to her.  How could it not?  And, that is why, I feel ultimatelydisappointed.  In the end, for whatever reason, the author chose to back away from what I perceive to be a much better ending, leaving this reader feeling cheated.  Maybe she fell in love with the idea of Adam the dreamer.  Maybe she did it for Zeb.  Maybe she just chickened out.<br /><br />Still, if she does write a fourth volume,( something showing the cultural development of a human/craker/pigoon world perhaps), I am sure I will pick it up, and, for the most part, enjoy it, as I did this book.  Or, perhaps Ms. Atwood is cleverer than I think, and the truth about Adam will come out in a fourth volume.  And, if this does happen, I will have to go back and give this book another star retroactively.
020530902X|5.0|It was in perfect condition. This is a great book for any writer.  I purchased this book as a required text for an english writing class.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|If I had to be an app - this is the one I would be when I grow up.<br /><br />After a minimal amount of time figuring which buttons do what, I use this app at least once a week to stargaze in my back yard. It's especially handy when you're looking for events that are not quite obvious (like Jupiter). I really like how this app can present the  constellations mapped against the stars (a non-obstructive overlay). It also has high-tech features like degrees of declination. Two thumbs up! And 8 paws! My dogs usually hang outside with me while I stargaze.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My granddaughter and I enjoyed this game and cant wait for additional rooms! It wasn't too difficult but challenging at times but really lots of fun figuring our way out of each level.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|For those times when you need to convert inches to centimeters. Or gallons to liters. Or euros to dollars. Or mmHg to millibar. This is the app for you. I recommend for general use, to everyone.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Loved hidden object games and this is one of my favorites. Worth downloading and purchasing. Give it a try you won't regret it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app for browsing through Pinterest. With the search tool I can quickly find examples/images of what I am interested int. Like leopard shoes, halloween costumes, and cake decorating ideas. This app makes it easy for me to pick up my Kindle and find cool images.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Very useful for all levels but specially for beginners!!! It helps for Pronunciation. Grammar. Vocabulary. And it is for free!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a book that our book club read and all rated the book very highly.  The descriptions of life at that time were very well developed and allowed us to put ourselves in the situation to feel the emotion, fear and horrors of the WW2 from the small town German perspective.  Loved the ending.
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|Wow, for a high budget film..........this movie SUCKKKKKED. Not work the $6 i paid to watch in it HD. Ugh
B0060D15AK|5.0|This is a great wholesome romantic  movie! On-screen chemistry of Bullock and Reynolds is awesome! So good I actually purchased the movie after watching three times.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|Title says it all<br /><br />What a horrible film. Will Smith has no emotion in this movie even though he's training his son in a open world in this movie. A father should have at least some concern about his son surviving in the wild. F--
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is a very fun game. Nice to be able to see everybody's score &amp; where they are at. Very addictive.
B00FEN000S|5.0|Story wise was okay but, you can't go wrong with giant robots and monsters duking it out. Guillermo del Toro knows how to make a film.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Great action movie that kept you interested.  I wasn't impressed with the Left/Right positioning. Hollywood should stick to movies and stay out of politics.
B00G5R6ZP6|5.0|T.S. Eliot claimed that Wilkie Collins, not Edgar Allan Poe, invented the detective novel. Whatever the verdict on that, “The Woman in White” (published 1859-1860) was certainly one of the most successful of mid Nineteenth Century mystery novels.<br /><br />A Londoner born and bred, Collins never achieved the fame of his lifelong friend Charles Dickens (with whom he collaborated on plays and other fiction) but was a very popular and innovative writer still very well worth reading today.<br /><br />This is a well-formatted edition, enhanced by the original illustrations, of  a classic mystery story that has been made into movies many times over the years
B000F8O4E0|5.0|This is a terrific ELO CD. It is full of great music and melodies. It is definitely a mood lifter. I highly recommend it for old and new fans! Enjoy!
B00G32VYDG|3.0|RIPD is a kind of MIB version minus the aliens from space, not bad visual effects<br />a little funny, more green screen movie, overall try to choose another movie instead.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is a terrific, excellent CD of Queen's Greatest Hits. You will find the best hits in this CD. Great rock, sounds, and melodies, and lyrics. I highly recommend it for old and new fans! Enjoy!
B003UZ3QMQ|4.0|Nice action movie, some scene are funny, like the movie<br />but some may have different opinions but so far I have fun<br />watching it, not looser at all.
B006H5120E|5.0|Is a high quality movie with a high quality content, more with the 3D effect. Also offer variety with the DVD format and extra content of the movie.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|When my doctor recommended I give up grain products, I was skeptical. So I purchased Grain Brain and drastically cut back on grain while I was reading it. He is right on. I am feeling better: clearer thinking, more energy, etc. I have read through the entire book twice in a short time and refer to my notes and the application chapter repeatedly. Now I plan to check out Dr. Perlmutter's website.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is the best purchase I made. Fits perfectly in my car. Charges my phone great and does not get hot while charging.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|well worth buying the full version cant wait for 2! kept me very entertained with the combination of hidden objects and an adventurous game play
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's great ,but you can not make everything. It does have limits, but other than that really great game. I recommend this for all ages.<br /><br />  -Mad gamer, signing out.:-)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I never write reviews - in fact this is my first one on Amazon. I feel obligated to other readers and fans after wasting my money on this book to warn them not to do the same.  Don't be deceived by how good Divergent & Insurgent were - this one isn't worth reading, not by a long shot.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's pretty fun if your traveling and your bored or something but it's still fun. Everyone says it's addicting but in my opinion it's not
B00002ND77|5.0|I purchased this movie because I didn't know very much about Malcolm X and wanted to learn about him.  I bought it several years ago and was just thinking about looking at it again.  He was a civil rights activist, took the surname X as he refused to use the last name that was given to his family by the slave master who owned his ancesters.  He was murdered at a very young age.  Denzel of course is wonderful as always.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I have only used it a couple of times and one time it didn't work well.  Will keep trying to use it though!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very fun and highly addicting. The downside is that you feel like you're being cheated by the developers most of the time. I have never had a purchase where I receive my credit or coin pack instantly. Every time I have to contact support and wait days before I get what I spent my money on. It's irritating to say the least.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a very good military, simulator game. I love it a lot and I think others will too. Also, you can do other things or different types of genres in it.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|ive not heard anything form Kamelot in a while, then I get this.<br />its much more their older sound but with the new lead and the slightly new direction i think this may be thier best effort yet
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|In a multi-tasking environment we operate in these days, it is refreshing to be reminded to prioritize and to stay focused.<br /><br />Well written with a very timely subject!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Really enjoyed the first two books, and was on my way to enjoying the third until I got near the end.
B00B52F278|5.0|A great series. The only thing I didn't like about it, was that it ended. But, I ws surprised by how it ended.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Was not Spartacus crucified, along with his legions?<br /><br />Just asking.
0887307280|5.0|If you have a small business or are thinking about starting one you Must read this book!  Everything you need to know
B00F99EMRE|5.0|The album Vapor Trails has a troubled back story, one you can read almost anywhere online. The original mix was too hot, too compressed, and brick wall mastered. The resultant aural assault gave the impression that something was there, but the sound was too indistinct to make out the nuances of the music.<br /><br />This new mix is wonderful, with sound that is better than their current release, Clockwork Angels. Geddy's base lines are crisp, and for the first time I could hear him playing chords. Neil Peart's drumming is distinct, and for the first time you can hear the subtleties. And Alex's guitar parts have a clarity that was entirely lacking in the original release. I'd never heard the acoustic guitar parts in the original release, but here they provide depth and dimension to the sound. This is what the album always should have been.
B006S01GH2|5.0|It's cute and funny.<br />And now for the filler:<br />WARNING: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SERIES FINALE OF BREAKING BAD.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I downloaded the game when it became availble on the Kindle Fire HD due to all the hype and friends playing it and raving about how great and addictive this game is.  It is very addictive and quite fun to play.  I don't like that you have to wait 30 minutes to get life when you lose your life but I guess that's one thing to make you put he game down and actually do something constructive - like work, etc.  Overall its a fun game and I recommend it.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|It tests your thinking but is not frustrating. The more you play the more fun it is. You learn to think ahead.
B00E9P959O|3.0|When I first heard Vapor Trails many years ago, I literally could not sit through the entire album in one sitting. Sonically, it was one of the worst engineered albums I’ve ever heard…it’s as if an uneducated high school kid took the controls, screwed around and outputted one of the most sonically cluttered, messy mixes ever. It was  headache-inducing and almost unlistenable. Although “Vapor Trails” signaled the joyous return of one my most favorite bands (after Neil Peart's tragic life experiences that almost ended the band), overall, I was very unsatisfied by the end result. The songs lacked any strong melodic lines or riffs or nuances of sonic beauty, and it seemed more of a musical experiment  in sonic rhythm than a cohesive album. In other words, it was an album where the band was trying to find their mojo again after being apart for many years. Given this, “Vapor Trails” is one of Rush’s weaker albums, both in terms of sound and composition.<br /><br />Many years later, the album is remixed and it sounds does great sonically, finally measuring  up to Rush’s impeccable standards. There is great separation of instruments and the sound is crystal clear.  Despite the great re-mastering, the songs still lack the finesse that were in Rush’s previous works. Luckily, after Vapor Trails, Rush did indeed rediscover their mojo and created a strong output of great later albums that measure up to their previous benchmarks. Vapor Trails is that one rare misstep in what otherwise is one of the most remarkable musical catalogs in this great band’s history.
B0056BMK6K|2.0|I simultaneously bought three books on being successful selling Kindle books.<br /><br />The other two had much better info.<br /><br />He also admits that a twitter post that went viral accelerated things for him, which is sort of like waiting to win a lottery if everyone else expects the same thing to happen to them.
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|The author alternates chapters between the history of America's nuclear weaponry and the Damascus accident itself.  The tale of the accident is fascinating, burdened now and then with the biographies of the people involved.  The tale of our nuclear weaponry and the extrardinary number and types of accidents, any one of which could, but fortunately did not, create a nuclear disaster is both fascinating and frightening.  The point is made that with humans involved, there will be errors.  Also, the original safeguarding of some of our weapons was far too lax.  Long but good read.
0694003611|5.0|My Grandson loved the book,<br />i would recommend this book for all young children that love books. We read this book every night.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|i saw this book in the store when i was still reading the previous one. when i went to order it, i saw the terrible reviews, mostly everyone because the story doesnt end here. I was okay with that... i dont mind another book to read, i dont like waiting either, but i can, as do as i am reading several series at this time. other than that , the book was good. more on gideon and well.. more
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I thought this movie would be too mushy but it wasn't.  The plot was clever and very entertaining.  A bit of a chick flick but I think my husband would like it anyway.  I loved it!
B00296A4F4|2.0|I am having trouble with the &#34;sound&#34;...only getting some words/songs straight thru without &#34;blip&#34; interruptions..mainly the entered 2 shows I've watch so far have caused me stress because the sound is awful
B00ECUARO8|2.0|The overall acting in this movie is pretty bad, and the story is weak and just not worth the time.
B008JFUO72|5.0|The movie arrived in perfect condition and I love it. Its your typical comic book movie & if you are a fan it is amazing
B00ESY77LO|4.0|It's a fine movie, good acting, decent story.  It is not a rush out must see but it is entertaining enough.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting. Just love to play it every chance I get. Very colorful and great graphics. Haven't encountered any problems.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works perfectly, and a relief that the trouble was only in the charger and not the device. Very happy with excellent customer service from Amazon at no cost to us!!
B001BANK32|5.0|Loved this book. If you are going to read Dr. Sleep by Steven king then this is a must to refresh your memory.  Definitely a 5 star.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I've read the instruction multiple times have yet to get the device to work properly.  This will be gifted with a warning.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Info on the dust jacket promises another hit from the king of legal thrillers.  Gotta disagree on this one and on both counts.  As other reviewers have stated, A Time to Kill was excellent in all respects, but this one is hardly in that league.  After a very rich introductory chapter the story begins its l-o-n-g slog through boring lawyering to the point that one loses sight of the real story described at the outset. Characters just don't display that characteristic richness that Grisham has offered in the past.  I couldn't get the least bit interested in most of them and suffered reading fatigue with page after page of the intricacies of our court system, trial lawyers, judges, etc.  I could imagine a dandy movie based on the introductory plotline, but totally lost interest about one-third of the way through.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I LOVE Sci-Fi films...and I LOVE Charlie Hunnam! This movie has both! It wasn't exactly what I expected, the story is much deeper than the movie reviewers gave it credit for. The acting is well-balanced between the characters, and there is great on-scene chemistry. A good mix of drama and action. Although there is no romance per-say, there is a &#34;romantic&#34;-like respect and tension that builds and is just enough for this type of film. Enjoy watching it over and over again!!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|thoroughly loved it..saw it first at the movies..instantly became a fan of the Lord of the Rings  series..will purchase the whole series
B00G24KKAS|5.0|Really no show can beat this, If you want to be on the edge of your seat every show, this is the right show for you.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|I am a new user of the Anker Uspeed Bus-Powered USB 3.0 4-Port Compact Hub with a Built-in 1ft USB 3.0 Cable. I liked a little longer cable so used a 1.5' extension cable which is also 3.0 capable. I have grumpy cordless mouse and cordless keyboard dongles in place on it along with one of the new Seagate 1TB hub powered hard drives and all seem to work well together. No matter where I connect a Wireless Mobile mouse 6000, it seems to object some with placement on its use-surface, but the all get along well otherwise. I get all my orders from the Prime feature and love the free of extra cost 2 day shipping. Overall I would give the hub a solid 8/10 rating.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favourite game ever! I love that is finally available for the kindle fire. I love wasting a ton of time playing it even though I'm stuck on level 30
B00AFEY354|5.0|Perks is about Charlie, a depressed boy who has entered freshman year of high school, and is desperately trying to fit in. This film brings us through his journey of self-awareness, with the help of Patrick and Sam, two step-siblings who allow Charlie into their circle of friends. Set in the 90's, the music score brings the perfect atmosphere to the film, and leaves you nostalgic for youth and the days of mixed tapes. The author of the book, Stephen Chbosky, directed and co-wrote the screenplay, which helped bring the movie adaptation to life. The casting was in my opinion was perfect. Patrick is my favorite character in the book, and Ezra Miller did him a great justice in this roll. I love Perks of Being a Wallflower, it is one of my favorite books, and films, and I highly recommend them both.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally, I thought I would never see Sugar Crush on Kindle. Yaaaay! This game is so addictive, I can't put it down.
1416972250|5.0|City of Glass is the third book in the Mortal Instrument series, and by far my favorite of the three. The character development is fantastic, we finally see more to each of these amazing characters in this story. Since this was originally the final book in the series, many loose ends are tied, and we finally get the answers we've been desperately longing for throughout the first two books. I could not stop reading, and actually had to stop my eyes from reading too far ahead. I truly connected with the characters in City of Glass, something I have not done in a very long time; I laughed, screamed, squealed, and yes, cried, throughout this book. I highly recommend it, and can't wait to see what's to come next!
039916409X|5.0|I have been working on some of Margaret's techniques and appreciate her generosity and training.<br /><br />Thanks for all the good efforts. .
B0060D2SU6|4.0|I love this movie, I have watched it many many times and I don't get tired of it. I highly recommended (there are some disgusting scenes in the begining, but it gets so much better. Just keep watching with an open mind).
B00756GKBA|4.0|I must say before I begin that I've been putting off writing this review for a long time, unaware of how I wanted to approach this album. As a fan of Madonna's since before Jr. High School, I have had time to more than acquaint myself with \\"The Queen of Pop\\" (And the only Queen of Pop) we call Madonna Louise Ciccone.<br /><br />But still, I must say that knowing that the woman is just five years away from turning sixty is odd. I'm not the type to dwell on this and normally I wouldn't be \\"ageist\\" but when you hear a fifty four year old using expletives or that she's a \\"Girl gone wild\\", It does take some getting used to.<br /><br />The album starts off with the wannabe club banger \\"Girl Gone Wild\\". I say wannabe because (let's face it) no hip club would play this. While the song is in a sense likeable, It is no different than some of the weak dance jams she's given us in recent years (Think \\"Celebration\\"). The song reeks of that dubstep/techno sound that is popular these days (Why? I have no clue), but at least it has a catchy hook that saves it from being a total clunker.<br /><br />Sadly this song sets the standard for the rest of the album. Honestly, the whole album generally sounds like the first track. All the uptempos possess this contemporary sound, that makes me believe she went in the studio with the goal of making a hit. Sadly, none of the uptempos are anywhere close to being classics on their own and are only standouts in the sense of being on the album. The thing that throws me (and a lot of fans off) is that even though William Orbit produces/writes tracks for the album, you wouldn't know it because they sound like top 40 wannabe drones and not anything like the revolutionary \\"Ray of Light\\"? of fifteen years ago. Musically, MDNA isn't that dissimilar to \\"Hard Candy\\". As the tracks have a slight urban feel to them. The one difference is that the sound of MDNA is supposed to be today's top 40 while Hard Candy was supposed to be 2006's top 40.<br /><br />The ballads on the album stick out when grouped together with the uptempos on the album. Madonna has always been an effective songwriter and she is in fine form on tracks like \\"Masterpiece\\" and \\"Falling Free\\". These two tracks bare the most resemblance to \\"Ray of Light\\" and returns Madonna back to her classic self of years past. \\"Falling Free\\" has this strange ambiance to the production and the lyrics that harkens back to album cuts like \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Skin\\". Don't get your hopes up though, because moments like this are few and far between as we are soon greeted by bonus tracks like the horrible \\"B-Day song\\". Yippie!<br /><br />Truthfully the bonus tracks are for the most part useless as the best tracks are all featured on the standard edition. I must say that I adore the first eleven tracks on the first disc. With the exception of \\"I'm Addicted\\" which I feel has been mildly overrated by fellow fans (along with \\"Turn Up the Radio\\"). My favorite tracks are the urban themed \\"I Don't Give A\\" as well as the infamous \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Superstar\\" and \\"I'm a Sinner\\". \\"Some Girls\\" sounds like nothing Madonna has ever done before and possess this cool, techno chill to it. One thing that popped in my mind while I was listening to this track was that it sounded almost like a note for note rewrite of Lady GaGa's \\"I Like It Rough\\".<br /><br />In general I found myself praising the album for its uniqueness (It sounds like nothing Madonna's done before), but I found the explicitness of some of the tracks strange and bewildering. Also, I was a bit put off by the top 40 sound of the tracks. The last thing Madonna should be doing is making tired drag queen club anthems (Cher) or trying to sound like GaGa. Sadly, on this album she does a bit of both.ballads on the album stick out when grouped together with the uptempos on the album.

B005EGXTHG|5.0|I read the whole trilogy in as many days. What a fantastic read. Each book is as thrilling as the next. I would recommend this book and the others in the trilogy to everyone!
B004EF65QA|5.0|If you've never watched this version of Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South you're in for a real treat. The main actor, Richard Armitage, puts in a stellar performance as John Thornton and I believe this movie launched his career - at least in my eyes. He, along with  Daniela Denby-Ashe who portray's Margaret Hale, just click and have that screen chemistry that some films lack. If I could have given this show 10 stars I would have for it won't disappoint you. The final scene is one of those where you just have to sit back and sigh. I've already watched it twice and it has inspired me to pick up the book for my Kindle to now read! I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have!
B003F5NSTW|5.0|This is a great read. Edgy and thrilling. Emotional and relative. It literally couldn't put it down and I would highly recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great when you connect to Facebook, help your friends by sending loves and getting some in return. Levels get increasingly harder but it's fun accomplishment
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I read the whole trilogy in as many days. What a fantastic read. Each book is as thrilling as the next. I would recommend this book and the others in the trilogy to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Amazing game! Although I liked the first one better, I think you should download it. The only problem is that it does not do the different colered coins like the first one. I think you should get temple run one if you do not have it and then get this one. Great game overall!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very easy to learn.  I enjoy the calming soundtrack.  This is a<br /> good game. I would recommend this game to all.
B00FJTWK0U|5.0|The 'Before' Trilogy is a must see for all movie aficionados, and Before Midnight is another masterpiece in writing, directing and acting. Don't watch it without first seeing the other two. Looking forward to the fourth movie in 2021!!
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|Steven Spielberg teams up with awesome actors Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley in a horrifying, but accurate accounting of the Holocaust in this deeply moving and heart rending story of the Polish Jews during the Nazi holocaust. Neeson, Spielberg and Kingsley team up in this very sobering, emotional rendition of the true story of Oskar Schindler who did what he could to save over 1000 Jews. Bravo!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was very skeptical as to how this series would close out.  I was a big fan of The Hunger Games until the last few chapters of Mocking Jay as the ending felt a little week and predictable.<br /><br />The Divergent series closed out fast, furious and all story loops were closed with great execution.  I didn't read any of the appendiums (...: A Divergent Story) and I don't think I will as I wouldn't want to cheapen the feeling of closure that I got from this series.<br /><br />Veronica Roth did an excellent job with this series! I look forward to seeing if she can come up with another story this compelling.

0670026557|3.0|I originally found 'Give and Take' on the Financial Times long list of business book of the year for 2013. Since then, it didn't make the short list, but I assumed it would be a strong candidate given the topic.<br /><br />Adam Grant divides people into three categories -- takers, matchers, or givers. He goes into detailed stories of each type of person, and how to spot each. Takers like to take more than they give, matchers like to give as much as they take, and givers give more than they take. Most people tend to be matchers. This makes sense- we grow up learning that if someone helps you, you should help them back. And although giving seems to have the best correlation to success, most people have negative stereotypes about givers, such as \\"nice guys finish last\\" and being nicknamed \\"doormats.\\" Where do those concepts come from?<br /><br />Well, givers are typically the most and least successful people. Givers that give too much end up burning out, and sink to the bottom of their schools, companies, and organizations. Givers that ask for help in return, and take a stance, usually get great rewards, and rise to the top with little effort. The magic number for giving seems to be 100 hours per year. The '100 hour rule' has been identified in numerous studies as the optimal amount of time to give per year for the best results.<br /><br />While the books has a positive message, it could have been easily summed up in a piece for the Wall Street Journal or a magazine. It's like reading a Malcolm Gladwell book where you understand everything in Chapter 1, and uses good writing to keep you hooked until the end. Grant mentions so many studies it gets boring. Great message, but shorter book next time.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Great colors and music for my daughter to sing and dance to.  I love the smile she has on her face when she watches this movie.
006202406X|1.0|For someone who spends a lot of her spare time reading, this book series was honestly one of my favorites of all time. That is, until the last book came out and the ending ruined all 3 books at once. People are reading books to be inspired and become absorbed in these novels to escape into a world other than their own. Instead of being left with a feeling of hope and happiness the author decides to leave her readers with a feeling of despair and regret for wasting their time. Even the way the death occurred was so casual and careless it was insulting to all of the characters in the book and readers themselves. So congratulations Veronica I will never be reading any of your books again.
031623480X|5.0|This is an excellent book, written by one of the most brilliant visionaries of neurological health.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is GREAT. I love how it lets you make your own adventure. The number of dragons are endless. You also don't have to worry about losing data. This game is also great for ALL ages and is a VERY family friendly game. The fact of the matter is that I recommend this game for everyone ages 1 and up.  The game is time consuming but gets better as you play it more frequently. All and all I give this game 5/5 stars. And I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

B0017KIBAI|5.0|A brand new controller for the Gamecube system. Came exactly as advertised. White, brand new box, japanese (but works on american consoles too), VERY long cord. Works great. Does a lot better than my old, worn out controller. Exactly what I needed. :D<br /><br />Wish it were a little less expensive, but for a brand new official Nintendo controller for a dead console, it's a decent price.

B00BD99JMW|4.0|For all the haters who complained about the ending: I'm sorry.  This series portrays the harsh realities of war. We are human and we don't always have perfect backup plans, especially when we are very young and we have a very short time to hatch our plans. Most of us don't get to be with the person we loved at age 18. Tobias is lucky because he gets to start over while he is still fairly young. Maybe he will wind up with Christina. Maybe he will wind up with someone from a different city, or even fron outside the United States! (How's that for improving your gene pool?)<br />I appreciate that Ms. Roth has the self-discipline to leave this as a trilogy and not try to spin out the story endlessly for personal profit as some young adult fiction authors are wont to do.<br />For those who argue that this ending is too harsh for its intended middle school audience, think of the ending of Chronicles of Narnia, which is aimed at 6-10-year-olds. EVERYBODY dies!<br />This novel only gets four stars from me because it is good, but not excellent. I don't smell a true classic here. However, much like her characters, Ms. Roth is very young. I hope that she has found or will find a group of authors much like Tolkien and Lewis's Inklings with whom she can bounce around ideas. I will be watching for her future works with interest and the hope that she may produce true classics as she matures.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I quite enjoyed Enders Game.  I missed reading it when I was younger.  The story was good.  Very intense.  It had a lot of gay overtones too.  It's pity the author is so despicable.

0345404475|5.0|Now, I have read this book 50 times since it was first published back when it was some obscure little novel on the bookshelves. I read it because, I was looking for a new science fiction author to discover and I am so glad that I broaden my literary horizons every year. Philip K. Dick comes up with the most original stories ever. His genius and mastery at placing characters in fantastic high tech settings is just out standing. He captures the heart and soul of humanity in an ever changing world where technology rules the social ecology of man, but not his indomitable will to achieve and aspire to greater horizons of reality. This book is excellent for science fiction fanatics like myself who like their sci fi with depth and meaning. Despite the absurdity of the title it is well worth the read. I have read it 50 times and I am about to read it another 50 times.
067101756X|5.0|I'm not much of a reader but this book is extremely interesting makes me question what your told a lot more. Recommend it for sure. I find myself thinking about it a lot more than I expected when I'm not reading it its unlike anything I've ever heard before.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Wow. What can I even say? At the end of a long awaited trilogy I expect to feel peace. I don't feel that at all. I don't know what inspired the author to write such a devastating ending but it made me wish I hadn't read it at all. Ugh!!

B009APMNB0|5.0|I am a professional photographer and I own a few other more expensive calibrators, so I will not be comparing this product to them.<br /><br />With the lowered cost of DSLR cameras over the last 8 or so years, the number of people taking up photography has skyrocketed. Nothing pains me more than seeing people who are getting started post pictures online and they are not able to reproduce the image quality they see on their downloads from the camera.<br /><br />When I first started I was more in the print arena than the digital space in regards to what my customers got. It took me a while before I discovered that I needed a way to get calibrated, and then another while to pull the trigger on the right piece of equipment to do the task. Once I did, what I saw on my screen matched my prints.<br /><br />Okay, back to the Smile. :)<br /><br />Again, marketed to hobbyists while not delivering the results expected and required at a professional level, it is going to get the everyday hobbyist to a new and improved level of quality in their work - that right there is gold, since it will remove frustration and make the user more satisfied with each component in their image generation system, and for some, it could be a component that fuels their desire to pursue photography full time.<br /><br />With this product, setup is easy and straightforward, and with the aid of the setup wizard, the user will get to a calibrated display in less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />Rather than list the pros and cons and talk about things that a hobbyist may not understand, I will close with this statement - to the hobbyist, this product will get you to a more color accurate print for a great price and shield you from the complexity of product offerings with more features than you need.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heard so much about Candy Crush Saga and I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about ....... until I got it for myself.  I love this game.  The only downside is that when you use up the allotted # of lives, you have to wait a certain amount of time to earn more.  You can buy more lives but I'm too cheap for that.

B000QCS8TW|4.0|I have read only this first book in the series, but what I've seen so far has encouraged me to continue. I'll have to say that the most unusual feature of this book is the body count--not that it is excessive or gory, but that with it, the author kills off three major characters well before the end. And one of them was a character through whom Martin had been carrying one of the multiple points of view.<br /><br />Of the surviving characters, my least favorite is Joffrey, not just because he is an awful person but also because he is relentlessly awful. Counterbalancing him is Tyrion Lannister, who is crafty but clear eyed; my intuition tells me that as his fate goes, so will the currents that drive the rest of the characters in this book.<br /><br />Of course, any epic fantasy has to draw at least one comparison to Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_. The biggest point, I think, is the feel of the worlds that the authors have created. To me, Tolkien's world seemed completely organic, as if the story had grown out of the ground, and the author had harvested it. The complexity of the races, languages, history, calendars--in many ways, the appendix at the end of _The Return of the King_ is the most fascinating reading of the whole series. _Game of Thrones_, on the other hand, feels completely artificial, as if the author has set the characters down on a flat surface, wound their keys, and let them tumble as they may. Despite the eight-thousand-year history behind the story's current action, I sense a chasm between those times that has not yet been bridged. I'm not saying that this is a problem with the work. In one important way, Martin's world has a big advantage over Tolkien's: his characters are free to decide their own fates. If the deaths of three major characters in the first book doesn't tell the reader that anything goes, I don't know what will. In contrast, the characters in Tolkien's world are fated--fated to fight the big battles, fated to meet the most despicable villain of all, fated to win despite enormous odds. Tolkien's world, for all of its organic feel, has artificial action, while Martin's world, for all of its artificial feel, has natural action. I look forward to seeing who survives the second book.villain of all, fated to win despite enormous odds.

It's brought much pleasure into my life ...
B003G4W49C|2.0|Considering the hype that swelled around this book when the trailers for the movie adaptation appeared last summer, I thought it was high time for me to sit down and read the story. Big-budget film, Hugo Award winner--what could go wrong? With this book, plenty. I was reminded forcibly of Robert Heinlein's _Starship Trooper_ as I read, and I kept making comparisons, all of them unfavorable, to Heinlein's work. _Ender's Game_, despite its length, fails to carry the heft of _Starship_, fails to present an engaging hero, fails to present the reader with a credibly dangerous alien race, and worst of all, relies on a trick to resolve the central conflict. Then, in the denouement, only after the bugs are all but wiped out, do we see the ambiguity about the alien race that we should have seen much earlier. Heinlein's work is dated now, written as it was in the gung-ho 1950s, but it is still a better book. It was unfortunate that the movie that it spawned some years back was inferior.
B00915G6MG|5.0|No one needed to smack the back of my head to buy this (if you know the show, you know what that means).  I didn't watch this show when it started, but a friend who was just sure that I would love it loaned her first season DVD set to me and that was all it took.  I have been hooked to this show for years.  I have the other nine seasons on DVD, so of course I got the tenth.  Amazon's Instant Video is nice, but you don't get the extras that you do with DVD or Blu-Ray.

006202406X|1.0|I have given the hunger games boxed set to my son for my grand kids to read when they are YA. Not this series. I liked Roth's first two books but this one I wanted to throw out the window. It was a strange plot with huge holes. The poorly done genes gone bad twist was just strange. It's like she took from Maze Runner and the Hunger games story then tried to give it a Harry Potter ending.  Nope Tris did not need to die. Yes there was foreshadowing of her death and Tris was part Dauntless but it just did not make sense.

006202406X|1.0|I feel like we were all duped. Did we stop to think why in the world it would be written in two perspectives? No, we had no idea it was because she was going to kill the main character. I personally will not read another book by Veronica Roth because Im reading for enjoyment not devestation. Especially when reading dystopian YA. I read classics like ana kareninena ( however its spelled) if i want to cry and feel loss. I know its her story to tell but if it sucks, whos gonna buy it? Did she forget she needs fans to sell the book? I mean, that third book could be the end of her career and for what? Seriously depressing. Pointless, i feel betrayed by the author like it was purposely viscious. I really hope no one kills themselves over this!  And sorry but i can get over a lackluster book-thats why i read YA Dystopian. But i CANT get over the death of the main character that we were led along for 3 years to love and root for.

B00FKQ38OE|5.0|Sir Paul McCartney could easily not put out an album for years and still be the premier artist today. The fact that after 50 years of performing he can still find inspiration to not only put out quality material but put out material that at times can be timely and at other nostalgic Macca is overwhelming.<br /><br />The album opens with the rocker &#34;Save Us&#34; which revisits the old Macca format of a driving guitar and that familiar McCartney bass style. From there this album takes you on different avenues. &#34;Get Me Out Of Here&#34; utilizes a 12 string guitar which has a sound similar to Zepplin from &#34;Physical Graffiti&#34; at times. &#34;Early Days&#34; paints the picture of the struggles that he and John Lennon went through to become the colossal icons they became. &#34;Queenie Eye&#34; has a riff with a consistency that stays with you long after the last note. Another standout is &#34;Everybody Out There&#34; which again utilizes the 12 string guitar to maintain the forceful drive introduces with the album opener.<br /><br />McCartney utilized different producers for this album which brings even yet a different feel that works. At times his voice has a style which harkens back to his Wings days while at others the natural aging of 70+ years adds a dimension that reminds us of the truth of his age and ours.<br /><br />Sir Paul McCartney is on the same level as Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. He is a world treasure that will be cherished long after he has left us, one who will be remembered for centuries to come. Any opportunity there is to experience a new element of this genius is one to be savored.....&#34;NEW&#34; does not disappoint in this element.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This is a great product idea, unfortunately google is taking its normal approach to a new product - don't support it and then eventually let it die. Unfortunately instead of a web page that's free to people, they've created something people are buying. It's a let down to see how slow adoption has been for chromecast - mostly due to google STILL not releasing a final SDK. I just don't get why they released this product if they weren't even ready for people to start developing for it. I kind of feel like I wasted my money until more than just netflix, hulu, and youtube support it.

B008602KQI|2.0|The Hunger Games is a movie about the authoritarian rule of a corrupt government that sponsors an annual reality-TV death-match between innocent kids. Sounds horrific right? Repulsive? Inhuman? You'd think so. Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore.<br /><br />Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film.<br /><br />This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.<br /><br />And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents.<br /><br />The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, distrurbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death-matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere.e it wasn't what I thought it should've been.

B005UG542S|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution.<br /><br />Sadly, I feel the final Harry Potter film falls victim to the exact same missteps that have plagued the series throughout its production. Sure, there are a number of things that this film does very well. The special effects are absolutely through the roof, the atmosphere and camerawork are suitably dark and ominous, and there a few very emotionally potent scenes, such as Snape's death and the discovery that Harry makes about his past soon after. Yet the core elements necessary for the foundation of the film are simply lacking, almost absent in certain cases. The interplay between the characters, all of whom we are supposed to be emotionally invested in and cheering for, seems oddly muted. There is a distinct lack of emotional interplay between characters at times when these emotions seem like they should be at their greatest. The moment where Ron and Hermione realize that Harry has decided to sacrifice himself to Voldemort feels extremely underplayed. They barely even try to stop him and seem extremely ready and willing to make peace with the fact that their best friend of 7 years has decided he must die. Also, when Harry magically resurrects himself from the dead (still trying to figure that one out.. the way it is presented in the film is quite confusing), he doesn't receive the reception that you would assume he would. His companions respond almost as if they expected him to come back to life all long.<br /><br />However, I feel the biggest and most damning issue with the film is the pacing and storytelling technique, especially in the latter portion after Harry is killed. The movie seems to speed hastily through the moments that require the most attention and should be the most emotionally resonant, while dwelling on and extending other scenes beyond their welcome. This absolutely kills the narrative drive of the movie, pulling you out of the action and lessening the scale and the potential emotional impact of the proceedings. The scene after Harry dies and where he meets Dumbledore is obviously a pivotal scene, but the length that it extends through coupled with its positioning squarely at the climax of the movie detracts from the flow and suspense. On the other hand, the scene that this entire decade's worth of movies has been building to where Harry and Voldemort finally clash is treated in an almost business-like fashion. The fight itself feels a bit hasty, but the real problem is that there is no emotional resolution after Voldemort is finally killed. None of the characters even mention or react to what has transpired. This is an absolutely unforgivable misstep because it undermines the entire event, as well as the 7 previous movies that have led to it. There is no emotional culmination and/or resolution with any of the characters after the evil they have been fighting for so long has finally been vanquished. Instead, we are led straight to the epilogue in less than 10 minutes with hardly a line of dialogue from anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Hermione, none of whom have anything to discuss except for details concerning the Elder Wand. The sense of accomplishment, gratification, resolution, or relief seems entirely absent.<br /><br />At the end of the day though, this is not a horrible movie. It certainly has a number of entertaining scenes and, like the films that came before it, is mostly entertaining and relatively solid. However, it falls victim to the same narrative-driven problems that the other films suffer from and, in this case, the missteps are particularly unforgivable given that this film is the final installment and the one where emotional resonance and correct pacing is the most vital. For that reason, although it is probably one of the better films in the series, I can't give it more than 2 stars. Admittedly, it feels a tad low, but the flaws are simply too significant to be overlooked and they fatally wound what could've been a satisfying conclusion to a relatively solid franchise.ly solid.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a good game and all but it needs to have stuff like minecraft pc like skins mods and the real nether it would help if they would make that kind of update.
0525478817|5.0|This was the first J Green I read. My book club was reading death and dying books and someone suggest this title.  I liked it so much that I sent it to my 21 year old daughter who was away for the summer. She had read LOOKING FOR ALASKA years ago and thorough enjoyed this, as well. So it's not just for teens.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I love jigsaw puzzles!  I look forward to a new puzzle every day.  Love the Magic Jigsaw Puzzles!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I flew through the first two books and was hooked.  Jonesing for the third to arrive on my kindle for over a year, and this I what I get? My wife hasn't the chance to read it yet, but I don't have the heart to tell her that book three turns into teen soft-porn that tosses aside any connection to the true characters in this trilogy. I guess that once you get a movie deal, all quality goes out the window.
B00FFHG6KQ|1.0|Do not buy!! The game controls are so glitched out. At least wait for an update really. Takes forever for an action to be performed. It  impossible to make free throws or pass as whenever you click the actual button for these actions nothing happens.
B000YDAYHC|5.0|my first impression was &#34;these boots are gunna be responsible for someone getting pregnant.&#34; Very stylish and comfortable. The sole does wear down fast. ive worn these about 5 times and i can see the wear already. i ordered a half size down should have went 1 whole size down but the extra room is perfect for doubling up socks.
0670033375|5.0|Easter Island and the surrounding Islands, who would have thought there was this much intriguing information about the islands. One of the top 3 books I have ever read. Diamond is a truly analytical thinker, has excellent concepts, perfect research, and no stone is left unturned in this amazing book about deforestation and the disappearance of the inhabitants of Easter Island. It definitely made me reflect on the fact that we cannot keep cutting down our trees and not replacing them. I had no idea how important it is to keep our timber replenished on an international scale if we want to succeed in keeping our environment sustainable.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I love it, great feel good music!!  I recommend this to anyone looking for feel-good music, and especially if you like this band...

B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I had problems with the app so I attempted to uninstall and reinstall the app. Well it said it was uninstalled but it wont load and is under device apps and cloud apps but inaccessable under both.... bummer,<br />my kids loved this and now we can't use it at all.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is the best hidden object game I have found. I don't have to spend money to get ahead. It is engaging, fun, and challenging enough to keep me coming back. Highly recommended!
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|Hard to read at times but even harder to put down. A wonderful tale of humanity, I haven't stopped thinking about this book since finishing it a week ago
006202406X|4.0|I have to admit, I couldn't put this book down. Just like all the others I was enthralled and wanted to know what was going to happen. Unfortunately, like most, at the end I was completely let down. I know that as a writer/storyteller she doesn't owe us a happy ending, but I still, so badly, wanted one for these two. So when the ending came, I felt let down. It was really a good read, like the rest of the series, but I felt the ending was anti-climatic. Don't miss it, but don't be happy about it either.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Unbelievable plot mechanical treatment, cardboard characters. It killed a couple of hours so I can't complain. five more words to submit
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is my second reading.  Although it is disturbing in many parts, it is a great love story if one looks beyond the SMDM  addiction of Christian, and focus on his internal struggle to please Ana.  Don't read this book if you can't handle the internal struggle of a true sadist who is searching to love himself and to be loved.

B0015346OM|5.0|A watershed event in our military history that is told in an engrossing story. Heroism, tradgedy, professionalism and fear make this a sprawling tale of a simple spec ops mission gone wrong. A must for any military history buff, but worth a read for every American.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicted to the game on Facebook.  So glad there is a version for my kindle.  Now if only there was a version of farm heroes saga for the kindle
006202406X|2.0|This book was pretty disappointing, considering how excited I was to read it after completing the first two books.  The story jumped all over the place, it had a very 'preachy' feel (we get it, you like themes, move on), none of the action was as exciting (or had the feeling of risk to it) as the other books, and then that ending. Oh well, fans of Tris and Tobias can always re-read the first book. Too bad.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This my favorite TV series.  I am waiting for season 4 with great anticipation.  Is Matthew really dead??  What a heart break!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I was delighted to rediscover Dan Torrence and follow his redemptive journey, but somewhat less impressed by &#34;The True Knot.&#34;  Generally, I think when King attempts to create &#34;new&#34; monsters he is often disappointing (the &#34;tear-vampire&#34; of &#34;The Library Policeman&#34; and &#34;Pennywise&#34; of &#34;It&#34; being notable exceptions).  I would have preferred seeing Dan battle ghosts displaced from the Overlook or vampires on the run from Jerusalem's Lot rather than the &#34;True.&#34;  However, I found Danny-boy's story sufficiently engaging to rate four stars out of five.

B009178OQA|5.0|The description doesn't really get you into the story. But once you start watching it, the cinematography and the story itself sucks you in. Makes you want to make a reservation at one of the restaurants, hop a flight and eat sushi for more money than you have.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|lots of fun fun fun fun<br />glad to finally have on Kindle Fire!!!<br />Keep them coming!!!  King.com has the gamers busy!!!!
1250038820|4.0|Hi!<br />If you haven't Facebooked them-- you must NOW. This has to be one for the most clever ideas! It pulls you in to other people. Once you look at this book and then review the Facebook page, you will look at people in a completely different light. This Book is not just for the coffee table but PERFECT for Christmas gifts (for those that have everything and those that want something)!<br /><br />... GO GET YOUR COPY!!

B007WEQ3K8|5.0|KFHD. Works well. No issues encountered during download or gameplay. It's a lot of fun and also somewhat frustrating at times.....but that's OK.....And since we learn from our mistakes....Well.....guess I have plenty more to learn! LOL!<br />It was a FAOTD so I got it.....though I would probably have bought it anyway since its only 99&cent; and it's well worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally available on the kindle fire HD. Keeps me busy when the 12 hour shifts drag on. I think I'm addicted.

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I haven't ear Grisham for some years and this book is certainly one that makes me wonder why.  It is very tightly plotted and I enjoyed getting back to some serious structure and also research in the planning if the book.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Let me start by saying I AM OK with losing a beloved character WHEN it makes sense, (RIP Sirius Black) and it didn't seem necessary or even right with the story line.  Even without that plot point, my rating would still be one star.<br /><br />In Divergent and Insurgent, Four & Tris read as round, multi-dimensional characters.  In Allegiant, they fall down as Flat Stanley's!  I'm also not a fan of the shifting POV's as I sometimes forgot who was narrating<br /><br />The main struggle between Factionless and Marcus has turned into, &#34;Mommy and Daddy are fighting again,&#34; and the anti-climactic way Tobias made everything right with Mommy was so over simplified it made me laugh.<br /><br />There were so many different ways this book could have gone to save it.  The writing was sub-par compared to the first two books, the plot had more holes than swiss cheese, and I no longer cared what happened to the now boring main duo.<br /><br />Allegiant is the bastard child of the trilogy.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|Normally I am decidedly lukewarm about people doing Dylan's songs. Every once in a blue moon along comes one that is actually better than the original. But on the whole - in my opinion anyway- no one does Dylan better than Dylan.<br /><br />This collection is a delight. There are some of the usual Ho Hum songs, but others soar. Take Lucinda Williams' Tryin to Get to Heaven, or Heart of Mine/Blake Mills or I Shall Be Released /Maroon 5. Or Diana Krall's exquisite rendition of Simple Twist of Fate and Thea Gillmore's equally scrumptious I'll Remember You!<br /><br />There are so many more and there are 5 discs in the set. This is a bargain for sure. Go on- buy it! If you are a Dylan fan, then this is a must have. I put it in my car CD player a month ago, and I'm still listening to it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am in a game of your own hands is a great way for you to have a great rtime with your  own horse .

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. So amazing. Very detailed and favorite  part was the ending.<br />I thought you could really feel everything
B00G32OER4|5.0|Ok, so it is Halloween week, we watched this in our cold and dark basement, and I had a few \\"disturbing\\" issues that happened after watching it. That probably added to the spookiness of the film, obviously! I did, however, get pulled in, and did feel the story was done well.<br /><br />After watching this, my toddler was up in her room crying (just having normal, toddler sleep probs). When I walked in the room, it was pitch dark, her nightlight had turned out, and I thought she was in her bed. As I approached the bed, she was actually in the middle of the room and touched my leg. OH MY GOSH I jumped so far and screamed. Poor thing, scared her too! Then she gets in bed and decides to kick the bed in a very rhythmic kick-kick-kick. It was reminiscent of the closet in the film. SCARED ME TO DEATH!!<br /><br />None of this was paranormal and/or hauntings, just my wee mind playing tricks on me after watching this in a dark basement. Really did get me going to the spook side!!
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|It did clean up cache, but still not sure if it improved the performance on my Android tablet. I will give it a little more time to see if it helps or slows it down more.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Best book I have read this year! Inspirational thought provoking and convicting. I would recommend to leaders in all areas of life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A very fun and addictive game - esp for the wife and kids!  A top rated game and very fun indeed.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Overall catching reading, keeps you on the pages and goes fast and easily.<br />When done, you don't feel like you read much.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Well, what can one say with this cast of characters and many of the real musicians as well.  Have seen this many times. The best!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This game is awesome. I have had hours of fun with this app. Many free levels. No repetition. Get this one.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|If old time Southerners watch this they must be squirming.  I live in a rental house built in the 50's and it had one of those &#34;out side&#34; toilets for &#34;the help.&#34;  It has been enclosed and made into a shower thank goodness.  This is a great movie.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Its a good read gonna finish the whole series it had me captivated for days. Have the other books already waiting
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book is not meant for people of all ages. It seems fairly obvious to me that it was meant for very young readers because there's absolutely no subtlety or finesse in the writing or the cliche story. Everything is written in a crude, plain manner devoid of much imagination or charm. The main character's emotions and objectives are spelled out so painstakingly obviously that you couldn't miss them if you tried. Characters' motivations are described so precisely that there's really no guesswork or inference allowed; the king's trueborn son is described as a vile, duplicitous, bad guy on the SAME PAGE introducing him as a character. Reading this book made me think the author has no faith in the intelligence of humanity and plainly hates us all.<br /><br />It's kind of sad because in spite of all of this terrible stuff the book is weirdly engaging. I won't be reading any more in the series and only gave this one a shot because it was free.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love facebook wish I'd bought stocks in this. What a concept. Just wish people would not whine and air negative thoughts. I don't like it.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|Man, this movie may be rather gruesome but the emotional ride it takes you on is spectacular! A retired porn star, living well in susburbia with his familyof wherever-istan is approached by a former colleague and offered a part in one more adult film that will ensure he will never have to work again. Little does he know that he is being drawn into a world of trouble when it seems that everyone involved with the production is out to make a type of porn film he is not comfortable with.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is great news for the day. Can always know what to wear or what to take along on my trip and not be caught freezing or roasting.
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|It seems as if Korn is emerging from their experimentation phase and getting back to basics because this album just does it all right. If you have ever liked a Korn album, especially through their first 5  albums, then you will enjoy this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many things to do that I'm not sure where to start. Great ideas hobbies recipes and so much more. Can easily get pins from family and friends.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I mean wow. It is not very often that a game transitions to a movie in such a spectacular fashion but Forward Unto Dawn breaks the mold of all game movies by tying directly into the game universe storyline. NO game movie before this has ever done this successfully. Not only does it tie into the game franchise seamlessly, it is an actually good sci-fi movie. I am of the opinion that this was the best sci-fi movie in 2012.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Thank you for finally making an appy for kindle !!!! Love this game very addicting. You can't just play once..

B000J1AGQI|5.0|Engrossing, captivating and, basically, historically accurate.  It is one of those movies that pulls you in and it decides when to let you go.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This is the 2nd book in the Ender series.  It's not as action packed but I liked it better than Ender's Game
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This battery grip is fantastic!  It adds much more versatility to the camera than I expected it would, without adding a lot of weight.<br /><br />The grip isn't too big, and the controls are well situated for ease of use.<br /><br />And, of course, the big bonus is that you have twice the battery capacity if you're doing a lot of shooting, or are going to be away from a charger for long periods of time.  A friend just got back from spending a month in El Salvador with this grip on his 7D, and he didn't have to worry about charging the batteries once!
006202406X|2.0|When writing science fiction, it's up to the author to create a believable world and I think Roth failed at that. I simply didn't buy the explainations for the factions. They weren't thought out enough and were at times down right confusing.<br /><br />Even in science fiction you need to do your research. If she wanted this to reach older audiences as well as young adult she should have spent more time on it. My guess is the 5 stars are younger readers and those who only read this type of soft science fiction. Not all of course, people have different opinions and I respect that.<br /><br />And anytime you need to check labels to know who is talking it's kinda a bad thing. A couple times I forgot.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />I think the choice Tris made was something she would have done but I don't believe she'd be so careless in the execution of her plan. But I was not opposed to her fate. Happy endings are overrated.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I love Bryson's writing style.  It is clear and concise and fun to read.  This book is so filled with interesting trivia about the years in and around 1927 that it makes your head swim.  But it is engaging and interesting stuff filled with Americana that I never really knew much about.  A great read.  We're proud to call Bill an \\"Iowan\\"!<br /><br />Bryson is one of our very favorite writers.  We have read everything he has written short of themes from his student days.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was a little hesitant coming into this book because I didn't understand why the reviews were so low, for a Veronica Roth book! So I came into it a little sad, thinking that this last one was going to end on a cliffhanger like Requiem or Mockingjay. So I waited and waited, and I just finished the book and you know what? It was amazing.<br /><br />First of all, I love how unpredictable these books are. It's like we learn something important in the first book, and we believe that it's true because Tris and her people do. Then in the second book, we learn that what we thought was true was actually...only half of a truth. So throughout this whole series, I came to realize that people lie a lot and a lot information gets twisted around-they only give us partial truths. Maybe I am not as clever as everyone else who \\"saw it all coming from the beginning\\" but there was so much information to absorbed, and it was amazing and crazy and I loved every moment of it!<br /><br />THE FEELS ARE STRONG in this last book-there is so much tension and hatred within the characters, but there were also moments of strong love and forgiveness that I couldn't help but get pulled under by. Veronica Roth is spectacular, and she makes me feel such strong, vivid emotions for these characters as if I knew them in real life. I never once thought \\"oh these are just made up people, they don't exist\\" because reading this series from the beginning, there is no way not to get attached to these characters. I cried so much in this book, more than any other book I have read...in my life. I love these characters, and they will always stay with me.<br /><br />The dual narrative was great, and I understood what Veronica Roth meant when she said that Tris' point of view was too narrow for this last book. I like seeing a whole different side of Tobias, he's strong despite his insecurities and I love him now even more than I did in the first two books. It kind of annoyed me when people saw him as whinny in this last book because looking at his background, it was obvious from day 1 that he was never as strong as he made himself to be, and it isn't until he admits his insecurities that he really does become strong.<br /><br />I just wanted to say to those people who gave this book a 1 star review: Have you ever read a one star book? Those are ones that are so bad that you can't even finish them. I get why people are upset, I mean, come on, that ending was like being stabbed in the heart repeatedly, it still hurts even after I closed the book. But it doesn't take away from how amazing this series is as a whole, and it was a complete ending with no unanswered questions. I wish it would have ended differently, I really do because I am still feeling the aftermath of all these feels but damn, this last book was amazing. Don't let other people's opinions cloud your own because I thought Allegiant was a fantastic book, and ended a phenomenal series on a very strong and memorable point.
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|Well what can you say about the movie? I can only say this: Bronson and Marvin rocks. Violent and mountain movie.
B00FFHG6KQ|1.0|the cpu opponent is so unrealistically unstoppable that it takes all the fun out of what could have been good a neat game.  Example: Shorter players never miss layups over the tallest defenders. cpu opponent regularly  shoots 65 - 70 percent. Ridiculous.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Good movie. Watched it with kids and they enjoyed a lot.<br />This should be allowed as short and sweet and not forced for many words :(

B00EDPFJA4|5.0|This album is pretty good. At first listen, I was skipping through the album to sample each of the songs. I listen to the album and I appreciate the storytelling of Drake.<br /><br />A lot of rap today is missing that. I know a lot of people hate on Drake because he the mainstream guy that radio/TV is playing now but he deserves his credit.<br /><br />I like this album more than &#34;Take Care&#34;.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|I was more than happy to see this app. Works perfectly and love the fact I don't need to buy a new clock.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So beautifully written! I expect nothing less from John green! He is the type of author that draws you in and really makes you fall in love with the characters. I loved this novel.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Denzel Washington is up to his usually high standard in this movie. I enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it a light enjoyable presentation.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is an awesome game.  Puzzle mode is very cool - you can turn the block around to see where like blocks are hidden.  I like this  mode because it is not timed - you can leave it - come back to it or just take your good ol time in matching like cubes. It is very calming.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I couldn't be more disappointed!  I was so excited for this book.  I feel like it was written by someone who didn't know the charters. Four was someone completely different and the love story was a huge disappointment .  I won't even comment on the ending because I'm still speechless.
B00G32OER4|2.0|The ghostbusting couple is handsome, well-dressed, and cheesy as a heck. The mother plays her part well but her part is another second rate hollywood possession.
B00314VYNE|5.0|Hat does not stay on the head.  Lets be honest that is not a big deal and if that is a big deal i think you should re evaluate your life priorities.<br /><br />Its a cool doll she has a little bit of a crazy face
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am very pleased with this bag.  I was worried about the quality since the price was much lower than other bags.  However, the bag has far exceeded my expectations.  I am able to fit two camera bodies and several lenses in the bag.  It is a good size...not too small and not too large and comfortable to carry.  Very happy with the purchase.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|It's a great product with a clear view of the picture and video when in use above or below water.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I would definitely recommend this on to others. Links right up to my chromebook and iphone. Is fast and reliable, and cheap!
B00G32TD98|5.0|I looked up a a lot of info online after seeing this and found out most of the movie is true but parts are fake to inhance the movie.<br />other then that very interesting and alitte freaky.i had to order a copy for home.
B006WMILQU|1.0|This version was not only unfaithful to the original Mansfield Park, it added in quite a few disgusting and disturbing references rape, it distorted the relationship with the Uncle insinuating he was lusting after her and added in an unnecessary aspect with her friendship with another character.  If you are looking for a good Jane Austin movie, skip this one!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|In the second book in this series Nikki Heat begins her day having to go in early to a crime scene. Well nothing new in her world yet, until she comes across a murdered famous gossip columnist who was found by none other than Rook. It is the first time Nikki has seen Rook since she stopped seeing him before he published his article about her. She's had a lot of problems with the way people treat her because of that article. Not only that but Roach is also having a little bit of resentment due to it as well.  So Nikki has to deal with this high profile case, and the fact that she's reunited with Rook again.<br />These two, and the rest of the team work hard to solve the cases they where just landed. And it will take everyone to work together to get these solved with all of the twists and turns its going to take.<br /><br />This book was awesome. I loved that we got to see more of Rook's thoughts in this book. I really enjoyed Rook. But I feel like he and Nikki have along way to go if they are every going to be in a real relationship. And Nikki once again goes above and beyond to get her case solved. Naked Heat has tons of twists and turns, with just enough \\"heat\\" to get you fired up! Can not wait to read more.. I'm in love with this series.
B005LAIIGM|3.0|Gravity is a movie concerned with special effects. The story, or 'plot' is not that thick; there is actually very little dialogue. This is a classic 'escape' or 'survival' epic.<br /><br />The makers of this film are very interested, indeed, about special effects. They like seeing 'space debris' and exploding space ships, which takes up about 30 percent of the 'plot'.<br />However, the whole time the viewer will be ''on the edge'', because in amongst the machines and technology is a human struggles for survival, which has been a staple of the Hollywood diet.<br /><br />It is definitely a good movie but could do with more of a storyline.
0307155102|5.0|Classic vocabulary builder with superb illustrations and humorous text. If you can afford only one Scarry book, this is the one to buy. My grandchildren enjoy it just as much as their parents did 40 years ago.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and so glad to finally be able to play on my kindle fire hd.  Thank you amazon
0394818237|5.0|My children loved this book and now it's my granddaughter's turn to enjoy it. Teaches vocabulary and a introduction to the many types of work people do in the world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great. Play against yourself or your facebook friends. Super addictive game good for everyone. A must try!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|For my son's birthday. He loves it!  The pen bit pops off but no worries. Wish there was a way to lock it in place.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that I am able to play on my Kindle Fire HD. If I could give it 10 star's I would. But I will say this, this game is highly addictive. Hope everyone enjoys this game as much as my family and I. Happy crushing everyone!!!
B0055MBQOM|2.0|To date I have not been able to get the same print on photo paper that shows on my screen. Perhaps i am doing the setup wrong.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Years and years since I read the Shinning but the sequel makes me want to re-read them both. Great book. Couldn't put it down once I got about a third of the way thru. Slow day at work. Got to finish it!!!!!
0743496736|4.0|No doubt this will be redundant, but I felt as if I had to revisit this book after a few years when I took note of how many shootings happen in the United States everyday. It's truly a sad, violent side of our country, how the evil living among us feel as if invoking tragedy on innocent others is the only way to get noticed or solve problems. The plight of Picoult's characters is human and relatable, how bullying lead a young man to commit atrocities against the people who hurt him. It's interesting to me though how this young male character did not take his own life to escape what he has done, but faces his sentence instead. This book to me serves as an indepth look at the psyche of perhaps several school shooters in recent history, despite the fact that Picoult more than likely knows none of them. This book is heartwrenching, and not just for the victims. Picoult excels in showing her readers the human side to the one we perceive to be the wrongdoer. I believe this book should be read in schools, if not to just show kids that violence has consequences, and will never, ever solve problems.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Funny and different. I really like the Sherlock Holmes theme and how they adapted it for the modern time. Enjoy
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I enjoy it. It's the perfect way to end my night from time to time. I enjoy that there are so many people interested in doing the right thing by each other. And of course there are the villains, too.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I didn't want to review this book as I can't think of the words to do it justice. But I'll give it a go because it was excellent!<br />'Me Before You' was so very sensitively written about a sensitive topic that is rarely discussed. Yet, it's a romance! I totally endorse all of the rave reviews this book as received; it's funny, sad, intriguing and informative. I was taken on an emotional journey with this book and felt that the plot guided me smoothly through it. For me, it was one of those rare books in which you really wanted to know what happened, but just didn't want the book to end to find out.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting forever to get this app..and now I'm super addicted lol :)I am So glad kindle got it,Finally!!! Now I don't have to be so upset when I get requests lol

B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Dave Grohl does a magnificent job by highlighting the Sound City studios. Information presented was great and the historic aspect of the film was interesting.

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Who doesn't love the under dog?<br />This movie has a little bit of it all : drama,  action,  suspense,  love story,  family,  comedy... Etc.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|A great adventure movie that I will never forget.  A must for anyone with kids or a kid at heart.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Yea there was action suspense but my ? Is do the zombies come to life after they  fall from high places
B000LB7G00|4.0|I have been using the Space Navigator itself for one week, after installation issues - Mac - Sketchup 8.<br />The software & manual are not the best!<br />The trouble is the space navigator is able to be used with many different software packages, and the use/ integration/ setup with each package varies. It took lots of forum reading / questions to get it working. If a product is advertised as working with a particular software product then manual / support should include sections relating to each application. With neither the 3Dconnexion nor Trimble Sketchup (for example) covering finer points of install / setup, its left to the user to sort.<br />The Space Navigator it is a solid well built unit and hence I am expecting it to last. Hence 4 stars<br />Advise check your OS / specific program on forums for issues prior to purchase.<br /><br />P.S. I would I have gone for the wireless version, but ordered wired version a day or so before the wireless launch.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|The searches are never the same and the search methods change so I never get bored playing. Mini games are fun too. I can usually finish in a couple days on other search and find apps but this one lasts weeks...challenging and fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is very addicting,<br />Good brain game.<br />I recommend to people who play  games to keep their brain sharp.<br />Great game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|... so as soon as it became available on Kindle I got it.  It's fun to play, and exasperating. I've been 3 days on one level, and that is becoming annoying. I'm spending way too much time on games now, work not getting done. Oh well.
B00DCX08MW|3.0|pretty rudimentary and repetitive landing on same 2 spots unless you buy the full game. but given the crude graphics and handling on this I wont.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. Fabulously written.  had me on the edge of my seat the whole time... Could not stop reading. Wanted more.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Love this series. Maggie Smith is terrific as the matriarch. The whole cast is quite appealing. Interesting to see this time period, and the gorgeous mansion.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Script was thin, but watchable. Glad I didn't pay the $12 theater ticket cost. If it weren't for actors I like, I would have skipped it. Will watch it again, with a big bucket of popcorn.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Justice League and the Avengers get a reality check as human nature contaminates  and sullies the super hero image. Love fantasy stories set in ancient settings, but Steelheart offers a subtle blend of fantasy and science fiction set in the present. A great adventure that is well-written.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Saw it when it hit the theaters. Have watched it 5 or 6 times on TV and decided to buy it. Gets ones mind off politics.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My three yo son love it. The game is small and in a few days he will be bored, but for a couple of days of entertainment is great.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I cannot figure out how to get from what comes up first to the Candy Crush Saga.  I know it should be very simple but my very computer savvy grandson couldn;'t come up with  anything, so it is not just that I am not too good on these matters.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is so fun and addicting. Once there is a update I can't stop playing until I finish it. I really recommend this for a gamer who has tree time and is bored. Now I,need to go defeat the last level peace.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I signed on to Amazon the first day this book was released and I could not believe all the horrible reviews.  I did my best to understand why, but soon found out I could not read too much into any review, because of the dozens of unannounced spoilers half the reviewers threw out there.  I therefore figured the best thing would be to read all three at once and see how bad this book was.  In my opinion, this book was an excellent follow up to the first two, continuing the story line in a consistent but not obvious direction through the entire series.<br /><br />So I enjoyed it... It's only fiction... I've read Game of Thrones and it's A LOT darker than this one.  Wheel of Time... darker....  This story - A happy ending really, a story of a true hero....<br /><br />That's all I'll say.  Won't want to spoil it like lots of you whiny folks out there almost did it to me... PEACE
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book is horrible. The way she portrays the characters doesn't make sense. This book was not worth my time or money
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Loved the movie because I live in the area where it was shot. I got a kick out of seeing parts of Philly & the suburbs on the screen. Love to know how the stars crossed US 1 to the diner without getting killed!!!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|They make life hard for non US based users.<br />Had to change apple account to US to download the App.<br />It couldnt connect with my modem when I tried to setup my 5 yr old Laptop ( my windows too old?)<br />Works well with Youtube, but Netflixs wont work or Googgle play, so very limited application for the Non US based user, so far.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I knew how this story ended, I still sat on the edge of my seat. All Americans should see this and appreciate the freedoms we enjoy.

B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I  have to stop watching Nicholas Sparks movies if I've read the book. His books are sooooo much better than the movies!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is such a cute game. My girls, my husband and myself are big fans. We love Despicable me so we love this game.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I could watch this over and over again - so much fun. It had a great old cast with a terrific finale.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I found this one of the most interesting and entertaining books I have read in a long time.  I laughed out loud, even in public, when I was reading it.

B00EUUJID6|5.0|Been a Il Volo Fan since American Idol!!! Every album gets better and better! Even though its going to be Halloween I can't stop listening to these beautiful Christmas songs! They sound just like angels and make you smile and have tears of joy! I will always love them and be a Ilvolover forever!! &lt;3
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I am sorry to say that in the first day after doing the first experiment, I had a really bad day:  I lost my credit card, and a little while later was told that the guest passes to my gym that I need for a friend had expired. Still later that day I got a bill marked \\"overdue, going to collection\\" - that I had already paid! And when I called them with the paid check in hand, they were out to lunch and not picking up the phone.  Not the blessing or gifts I had in mind! Did not work at all for me!<br /><br />I am so sorry, because I really enjoyed reading the book, and I am a big fan of the Course in Miracles where the author comes from. So I have to say that she oversimplifies the issue, and God's grace does not come from just a threat to the powers that be to get blessings and gifts on demand. Maybe I had such a hard day after trying this because God is more than a mere physical power we can manipulate, but is really the Source of Love Who exists beyond our ability to directly control for our passing wishes. Amen!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Recieced my ahead of time est.  P;eased with all accepts. Ease of selection.<br />Access was quick and transaction was ease..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is very addictive. Can't get enough of it. I just wish the minimum for lives was more than 5.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|These poor beautiful majestic creatures should be left alone. They aren't \\"circus performing sperm banks\\" they take their young away from their pods - that would be like someone coming to your house and taking YOURS! Seaworld you should be ashamed blaming the trainers for their accidents & should be APPAULD of the death of Dawn Brancheau. It's funny how you changed your story when you said she slipped but had to reevaluate your actions because of the witnesses videos! You truly are money grubbing cowards.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is worth $7 when 0.8.0 comes<br />Out this game will.be the best because it has minecarts and pumpkins and more! :D
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|There have been several rumblings over the years that Mazzy Star was working on their new album and that it would be released &#34;soon&#34;. I had all but lost hope that it would ever happen and dismissed rumors of Seasons Of Your Day as wishful hyperbole.<br />This, their first album in seventeen years, galvanized this fan's perspective that the brain-trust duo of Hope Sandoval and David Roback need to be locked in a room together for several weeks out of the year so that they must produce more new material.<br />Mazzy Star, as ever, remains difficult to classify. They are not quite folk, not quite pop, not rock, ect. I have heard them labeled as &#34;dream pop&#34; several times over the years, but I think that label is lazy. If you want ambient music you can put on Mazzy Star and it will set a nice atmosphere, certainly. But if you give yourself over and pay close attention, you just might find too many parts of yourself awakening for it ever to be called a dream.<br /><br />For my part I most enjoyed the title track. There are exotic and common ruminations of life and mystery throughout the album. Nothing here rocks as hard and funky as &#34;Hair and Skin&#34;, released a couple years ago through an EP I recommend, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention Hope Sandoval's solo projects in the interim of their last album, Hope Sandoval & the Warm Inventions. Alone, Hope's music sounds like a pleasant drifting in the seas. With David Roback as her writing partner, he at once anchors her and sets her free; the seas may become turbulent and through the rise and fall we are brought places she would never have taken us alone. He is her chaos. And in my eyes at least, they need one another.<br /><br />Enjoy the music. Tell your friends about it. Hopefully it will be a head-turning success and inspire Mazzy Star to get back to the studio soon than later.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|Nothiing to say about the music, in this context. Those who are interested have their opinions. It does not, of course, include &#34;<br />Miles of Aisles&#34; or &#34;Shadows and Light&#34;,  both of those being &#34;live&#34; recordings, though falling in this era.<br /><br />Packaging, as pointed out by other reviewers: poor. Each CD is enclosed in a stiff cardboard sleeve which is a facsimile (more of less) of the original LP (yes, she's that old, kids. I'm surprised you've heard of her), from which it's hard to extract the thing without getting finger oil etc on it, or tearing the sleeve. Re-package or be careful.<br /><br />Actually, now that I think about it, for those who are ignorant of the music, and to my astonishment there are some who are:<br /><br />These ten records show the greatest (in my opinion) of all North American folk/popular/rock (call it what you will) musicians at a consistently high level of proficiency and creativity, and whatever else goes into this sort of thing. The last couple, perhaps, show elements that before long, perhaps, would pull the balance asunder, but on the other hand, are just evidence of the dynamic that made JM exciting as well as statically pleasing beyond all other artists of her epoch.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Although I'll admit there were some slow moments and a lot of climaxes, as a previous review noted, the story was true to how the characters would have acted in reality and necessary to create such a powerful ending that aligned with the overall story. If this were really happening, this is how it would have gone down. I disagree with the review who noted it as too sci-fi; I'm not very interested in that genre and I had no issue with the use of technology in this book. It isn't much more than the previous two.<br /><br />This book is powerful, and beautiful. Through and through, it's an emotional roller coaster, but don't give one star because it made you cry and you can't handle an author who stays true to her characters.<br /><br />I do wish there was a little more \\"multiplication\\", though, to quote Christina.<br /><br />Read it. Decide for yourself.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A must read of what life could become. It shows one what could happen to each of us. All three books are a must on your book shelves.
1603425381|5.0|Most afghans or baby blankets I make often have no edging in the pattern.  I saw this book and immediately ordered it, i'm glad I did.  It helps me put that special finishing touch on my projects.  I definetly recommend this for anyone who likes to add that little something special to their crochet.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I liked it so much, I ordered two more so I can keep one in every car.  This adapter works great since my wife insists on using an iPhone, but I prefer a Windows phone (Nokia 928).  With this adapter, we can both have our phones charging while we travel, and with the addition of the AC adapter from Anker, we have dual charging when we arrive at our destination as well.
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I loved this charming romantic story.  The narrator has issues with inter-personal relationships. It is implied that he is an&#34;Asby&#34; ( Aspergers Syndrome).  I have more compassion and acceptance for people who seem a little &#34;off&#34; in their social interactions as a result of this entertaining, sweet story.  I listened to the audio version; it was wonderful !
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book is just what I wanted when I bought it.  A nice story that captures the essence of characters in an Irish village.  There are a couple of laugh out loud scenes, as well as some heart tugging ones.
B007XUMHQK|5.0|I've always loved the music on Shady Grove -- in my mind as a studio album it's second only to Quicksilver's eponymous debut.  Unfortunately, the sound on the green label Capitol LP was indistinct and, as another reviewer describes it, murky.  I had thought such poor sound quality might have been due to running tape over the monitoring heads too many times during recording and to the typically atrocious Capitol vinyl pressings of that time.  But listening to this Culture Factory CD is a pure joy.  Not only can I relax and enjoy the music, but I get to revel in some pretty fine sounds.  It may sound like a cliche, but until you've heard this remastering you really haven't heard Shady Grove yet.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it! We use it almost everyday :) easy to install and very practical! Would definitely recommend having one to everyone.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I seriously could not out this book down. I am not a big reader, but this one kept me wanting more. Great series all together.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best mini series by far if you like English drama.  Maggie Smith plays a great role as the countess.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|I struggled through the first hundred pages or so. I must admit that I didn't really know what was going on. After that, however, I got to know the characters and the pages flew as I became increasingly engrossed.<br /><br />Greg Barron, author of Rotten Gods and Savage Tide
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I would recommand this game to all my friends and family as to why i put 5 stars is because it is relaxing for me.
B00CP4RZCU|1.0|This cd was too soft for Black Label. I did not read about the cd much before I bought it. I am used to the hard music they usually put out and I was disappointed.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|An internet search company with some amazing far reaching technological innovations becomes an unstoppable behemoth; an all-in-one amalgam of all internet companies and capabilities, such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Yelp, Twitter, Facebook, etc.  The Circle is run by 3 people referred to by the company as “wise men” (analogous to Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak?) and an Inner Circle of 40.<br /><br />Mae is working in a dead end, boring and low paying job, but obtains a coveted job at the Circle campus, thanks to the efforts of her college friend Annie, a member of the Inner Circle.  Mae is quickly consumed by the Circle culture of complete connectivity and access in both her professional and private life.  Such connectivity is not without its costs however, particularly in terms of privacy, but Mae doesn’t seem to feel them at all, glossing over anything that doesn’t correspond with the company vision (and her new importance in the company) even at the expense of her parents and an old friend.<br /><br />Many of the Circle’s ideas are attractive on some level.  Inexpensive and unobtrusive surveillance cameras everywhere drastically reduce crime and human rights violations, as anyone with a computer can look at any camera at any time and report what is happening.  Politicians wear a camera at all time so as to be completely “transparent” in their dealings and assure they have no shady dealings and act in the best interests of their constituents.  Everyone online can track down and capture fugitives.  Chips inserted into the bones of newborns guarantee that no child will ever go missing.  However, the Circle wants to control all aspects of life from cradle to grave including; registration, voting, school records, purchase tracking, medical records, news dissemination, and indeed the flow of all information.  There is a wonderful but rather obvious metaphor towards the end of the book regarding the inevitable result of such a system, involvingnewly discovered sea creatures from the Marianas Trench.<br /><br />The book raises a lot of interesting questions about our ever increasingly interconnected society and whether personal privacy can exist in such a world.  Mae was an interesting character, deeply motivated by her need for approval, with her personality changing drastically for the worse as her importance increased.  Obviously, this is a cautionary tale, so Mae’s all too common character traits and flaws were appropriate.  I enjoyed reading about a strong but flawed female protagonist, instead of the helpless damsel or flawless superwoman.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Yet another incredible story by the one and only Stephen King.  He has a way of making sure you keep turning the pages.
B004FW0Y1Y|5.0|I was given the audio book, which was such a great way to understand Frank's childhood in Ireland.  Hearing his voice and songs he sang to make his point of what life was like in his world.<br />His descriptions of  most everything were so vivid that you could almost smell the terrible conditions he grew up in.  It was sad, but one did laugh at some of his remarks.<br />Then in New York his love of the Library - his life in the United States.<br /><br />After listening to his book I heard he and his brother  speak in a New York City off Broadway Theatre.  What a great experience!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|What can you say its The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This is a must see! Seems I find something else I love about it each time.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|I had so much fun with this game.  The way it puts your mind to work in figuring out how to do things is great. Enjoy

B00AB65SVE|3.0|The fourth season was pretty much same as the proceeding three. Doesn't seem to be growing much and I don't know whether I would purchase season five.
B000005JAK|5.0|It's really hard for me to pick a favorite Husker Du record because they are all so amazing but their major label debut released in 1986 certainly is in the top 5. Both The Replacements and Husker Du signing to the majors resulted in more polish in the songs and production which some fans were okay with while others resented both bands. With Tim from The Mats (released just a few months before Candy Apple Grey) featuring ballads like \\"Swingin' Party\\" and \\"Here Comes A Regular\\", Husker Du would show their skill for writing softer material as well with early signs of Bob Mould's solo career on \\"Too Far Down\\" and \\"Hardly Getting Over It\\" and Grant Hart providing a slow but still edgy piano tune titled \\"No Promise Have I Made.\\" There is still the loud and fast energy of Mould's \\"Crystal\\" and Hart's \\"Don't Want To Know If You Are Lonely\\", a song later covered a few times by Green Day. While both The Mats and Husker Du would sound more crisp on the Warner Brothers releases, they were still a bit too ahead of their time to be accepted in the mainstream. No fear though, this is still a great record from an important band. You can hear hints of Nirvana's celebrated Nevermind record on this album but in my opinion, that record sounds very tame and almost like hair metal compared to this.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|As per usual the whole season was excellent. I cant get enough of it and am counting the days untill I can get my hands on season seven
B00EMVNCJE|4.0|Cult of Mirrors is a story about an attorney Cheryl, with a good heart, who lives by the golden rule of treating others as you would like to be treated, even the less fortunate.  To bad she lives in a world where big sharks eat little sharks - as she must take on a crooked judicial system and a Student Loan Company in which the hypocrisy within those systems is filled with cronyism and sexism. She must deal with the \\"isms\\" and maintain her workload - and all the while strange things are happening and she is being stalked, or is she?  You'll have to take the ride to find out.<br />I truly enjoyed the complex character of Cheryl - the good girl that snorts bath salts. How ironic.  A couple of places in the story, I wanted the pacing to move faster, still I found myself at times hanging on the edge of my seat!<br />If you like a good courtroom drama filled with mystery and thrilling moments, this is the book to read!
B009RX85N0|4.0|once again the series captures the attention, great entertainment and interesting character development.  Now waiting impatiently for the 3rd season
B006LSZECO|5.0|I understand why many readers are unhappy with the end.  And it could have been different, or better.  But I still give Ms. Flynn five stars as she writes the kind of novels I like.  They are driven by plot and character, and they tell the story without adding lots of description and unnecessary detail.  And the plot WAS interesting throughout with excellent pacing.
B0015AARJI|5.0|A reliable controller at a fair price. You can't go wrong with this one. Most PS3 controllers start to lose battery life after continued use. A brand new controller greatly improves your gaming experience.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book had me smiling and crying throughout the whole book. Even from book one, DIVERGENT, I was hooked from the first page. ALLEGIANT was the most action packed thriller, sad, and romantic out of the three books. This is a defiant have-to-read book. Author, VERONICA ROTH, really hit the jackpot in the series ending book, ALLEGIANT.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Great scares in a very we'll acted movie. A plausible story about a house that is haunted. This one stands out from some of bad horror movies being made recently.
B000ME5B30|5.0|The students I work with enjoyed the movie. It was very imformative. I recommend that others show there students this video

B00BFV1JVM|5.0|I wasn't really interested in these books until my 11 year old niece and my sister said I had to read them.  I read all 3 books in a couple of weeks.  Very intense but thoroughly enjoyable.
0740748475|5.0|This was a gift that was much appreciated.  I bought the hardcover over the paperback cover because it looks so much better on the book shelf, and I wanted it to last.
B00CSYR432|3.0|I think I've seen all of Miyazaki, and I'd give most of his work five stars.  I know that Hayao, the master, only wrote and advised on this as he hands down his legacy and knowledge to his son, but I would suggest to the son that he not rely too heavily on the same mischievous but bright boy and proper and not quite as precocious girl, despite the richness of the treatment, lest he fall into the trap of formula.
006202406X|5.0|T_T This book killed me. I am dead. I am crushed. I am pulverized. I... honestly don't know what to say.<br />  Allegiant is the explosive conclusion to The Divergent Trilogy by Veronica Roth. I loved it. And in the end I hated what the author did to me. I want to scream \\"NOOOOO!!! You can't do this!\\"<br />  When it arrived the day it was released, I was beyond excited. I immediately began reading it. Knowing it was the final book, I chose to take my time. I didn't rush it. The beginning started out pretty slow and gradual, as this book takes place a week or so after the events of book two.<br />  But about 10 chapters in, it was going at a steady pace and I was getting answers. A third of the way in, my mind was blown. I had a hard time contemplating everything I was learning about the world of Divergent.<br />  Allegiant is told from both the perspectives of Tris and Four (also shipped as Fourtris). I was glad for the chance to get inside Four's head. But I also got irritated with him from time to time.<br />  Eventually he and Tris define their relationship and take it to the next level.<br />  The ending though... *choke* I am so... crushed...<br />  Violence - Mild. Violence is not gratuitous.<br />  Sexy stuff - Lots of kissing and sex is implied.<br />  Language - A few uses of the s-word, \\"d*mn\\", \\"h*ll\\", and cr*p\\".<br />  Scary Scenes - Mild.<br /><br />  All in all, this conclusion was in fact explosive. In more ways than one, as it both imploded my heart, and blew me away.<br />  What did you think of the finale?<br /><br />5 of 5 stars!

1476727651|5.0|The book is awesome...one of S. Kings best.  A great follow up to the Shining. I am a collector too.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I bought it for my brother in law and he loves that it came with a replica Phaser. Get addition to a Star Trek fan's collection.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Good story, kept my interest, no violence. The characters were well developed  but believable.  This series showed all our human frailties and that they can be overcome.
B00DNV9V1W|4.0|I bought this for a friend's phone and he says they work better than other, more expensive brands. I also bought this same name brand for my iPhone 5 and they seem to work great. I like the fact that they come with a lifetime warranty, I've never had to use it but other reviews I've read say the company's fairly easy to get replacements from.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I had seen show, so I wanted my family to see it. They all loved the movie and this is our family heirloom.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|For the longest time I kept hearing about how great this book was, but I never took the initiative to read it myself. I ignored those omens, so to speak. I regret that I didn't read this book sooner, because it opened my eyes and my heart. Don't let another moment pass before you read this important book.
B004G600A4|4.0|I bought this for my great grand daughters. They like it so much they watch it over and over. Buy it
B0018STVHQ|5.0|Loved this movie!!<br /><br />Drama, deceit, betrayal, love and greed!!<br /><br />what more could you ask for??<br /><br />The costumes were lovely, Scarlett and Natalie brought the grit and drama!
B001EC2IT4|5.0|He says it himself, right there in the movie: he's &#34;the ghost with the most.&#34;<br />Baldwin, Davis, Ryder, O'Hara, Jones; one star of rating for each star in the cast, even if it weren't a  brilliant film.<br />Burton at his best as a director, and Danny Elfman at his most Dan-ny-Elf-man Dan-ny-Elf-man.<br />This movie belongs in every top-ten list of movies ever.<br />Yes, even the French Minimalist Expressionism films.<br />Don't know why I bothered to write this review. I'm pretty sure kids are born knowing this movie is great.<br />You can't see me, but I'm dropping the mouse and walking away from the computer now.
B0030ZOYHC|3.0|Ever since the release of Rebuild 3.33 my opinions on this film are very mixed and kind of undecided. For one thing, seeing Evangelion with updated animation is very nice, and the re-telling of the first 6 episodes is handled competently, albeit lacking a few very important details I would have loved to see updated. The huge problem is how this first film feel so disconnected from the other two movies of the franchise. 2.22 did a decent job of balancing the old and the new, while 3.33 went off-the-rails bonkers trying to do a new \\"thing\\" while at the same time being an unoriginal rehash of episodes 23-24. So, in the wake of the second and third films, the first one feels disjointed and abandoned given that Studio Khara decided that they weren't simply gonna do a rehash... even though they did just that with the third film. I suppose I still enjoy it, even though my opinion of the Rebuild series has reached an all-time low. Eva fans will have no choice but to see it, but to non-fans I don't recommend it. I also wish it could have been a little longer, it's not like it wasn't gonna rake in some revenue.
B0041D843M|5.0|The China Study was completely eye-opening.  It's fascinating it anyone interested in learning more about how the food we eat can change our health.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I purchased this headset for my son and he loves it and is better than other more expensive ones are. Thankyou
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love To Be Loved and Close Your Eyes.  Those are great songs.  I feel these are Michael Buble's best songs ever.
B000WQW988|5.0|It is live in front of a very mixed New York audience, and it has the live cello presence -- look up Lori Goldston, the Seattle-area woman who excelled on this with great attention and sensitivity to Kurt Cobain's sometimes-anguished performance.  Yet a relaxed performance, you will see Kurt as never before, and  you will see why they were famous.  Cobain displays the advancing alienation and obsession that later killed him.
B001AITH50|5.0|I've read the book but I still LOVE this film despite the discrepancies. Tom Cruise delivers a phenomenal performance as Lestat de Lioncourt. In all honesty he is the best thing about this movie. I watch it time and time again just to see Tom as Lestat!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This moves at a constant pace that's well-suited to the story. The plot is well formed and provides enough twists and turns to make it an enjoyable read. Grisham never fails to deliver.
034580709X|4.0|Harry Hole, an inspector from the Oslo Crime Squad is sent to Sydney to observe the investigation of a murder case involving a high profile young woman from Norway.<br /><br />He is assigned to work with the Sydney police and not take an active role. Andrew Kingston of the police will act as his escort during his stay. Andrew is an Aborigine who has overcome much in his life. He also has many tales of the history of his people that he shares during the downtime of the investigation. This adds to the character development and makes Andrew a very likable character.<br /><br />Harry and Andrew work together with other members of the detective unit and we come across an interesting cast of characters. They also uncover that a number of women were murdered with the same way as the case Harry is interested in so they feel a serial killer is at work.<br /><br />The pacing is swift and the suspense mounts throughout. The author also adds a number of surprises that keep the reader's attention and make the story unique.<br /><br />Harry meets a young woman and they form a romantic relationship. He tells her of his past in Norway and an accident while he was chasing a suspect. Harry was intoxicated and crashed the car he was driving, killing his partner. For this reason, he is trying to stay away from drinking alcohol. He doesn't succeed in this and the road to alcoholic dependency is played out in the second portion of the story.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story but was disappointed that Harry wasn't able to live up to the heroic image I had for him at the start of the case. The frailty of Harry's resolve and the human failure of other characters is well played in the novel.<br /><br />3 1/2 stars moving up to 4 for the story and descriptions.
B002SLNK5G|5.0|So good, I loved this show when it was on and I was in the mood to see it, so I paid the dollar for the pilot and I might just buy the season. This show is so good and the quality of the stream is great! I love amazon, after I bought this episode, they gave me a dollar credit for an mp3 song.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|Nothing like paying for a game and seeing &#34;coming soon&#34; on some of the levels. Get the game done, THEN release it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game can't get enough wish i could get more lives they run out much to fast. Send more lives!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book, it was brilliantly written, the characters seemed so real, like people everybody would know and love in real life. We all have different quirky character traits and nobody is perfect as this book shows.  It's so believe able, honest, descriptive, funny, because the two main characters can be frustrating but only momentarily.  It flows beautifully and gets to the point. I enjoyed every word from beginning to end and I highly recommend it as a brilliant book that everybody will love.  Most importantly it contains very little arrogance or the crap value.  Buy it now. W
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love how the pictures are HD not like pictures are. My camera on my kindle is not HD and I don't like that.
B00C2IPB66|5.0|Always a great movie. Even better in blu-ray. Special edition is a plus and the extended edition is a great addtion.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This was an excellent book, absolutely exceptional, except for on page 380, when a cigarette lights gasoline on fire. It is impossible for a cigarette, lighted or not, to ignite gasoline.
1469220520|3.0|The voice of Gideon was terrible when she voiced it. Made me laugh. I had a very hard time with that. It would have been better to not do a \\"guy\\" voice/
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I do believe this is a wonderful way to learn a new language b aside from living abroad. It starts you off simple then gradually starts to challenge you more and more.<br />I've always wanted to learn another language, and working in the tourist industry r renewed that want. Meeting thousands of people every year and having the ability to speak some of the other languages is a priceless skill and ability. Though this is no completely perfect I cannot wait to brave to speak with my friends from all over the world in their own language.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|This movie kept you guessing through most of it. When you think it was going one way, it takes a turn on you. The cast did a good job playing their roles.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I like it. Nice kill shout view. Animal does not move until gun shout. I would like to shout more than one animal at a time.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|The final chapter in the Spartacus saga. It was a great series. The storyline, the characters, the acting and action was top notch. The written history of Spartacus was limited, and writers did a wonderful job of making the story very compelling. There was no bordom when it came to this. From the first season, Blood and Sand to the final chapter War of the Damned kept you on a rollercoaster ride never knowing where it was going to stop.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Excellent!  I highly recommend the entire series.  I hope you enjoy them as much as I do...worth owning the whole collection.
B008PZZYB2|5.0|GreAt movie. Very funny. Simply a classic Ben stiller movie ! I have seen this many times and is still funny
B00684J49U|5.0|Excellent!  I highly recommend the entire series.  I truely hope you love them as much as I do...worth owning the whole collection.
B003G4W49C|3.0|My husband LOVES this book. It is his favorite by far. If you are reading this book, it is great. But I tried to listen to it on audio and I had a harder time with that because of the language. I've talked to other people who love it, and they didn't notice any bad language, but when you listen to the audio version, it's just really in your face. I couldn't finish it because of that. I am going to try reading it and see if my eyes can glaze over the language.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book once I start reading I couldn't put it away !!! Made my minde think of my prior  incounters . I would recommend those books to my friends .
0374105235|5.0|This is a really eye opening book. I cannot BELIEVE that all of the things that Beah talks about are really going on RIGHT NOW. I really will never look at the world the same. This book is pretty graphic. Not for children or teens. But very memorable and life changing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The writing is crisp, the casting is imaginative and impeccable. The characters are original. The pacing is excellent. It's just entertainment, but it is wonderfully well crafted.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Amazing. Sean takes us into teslas life. It's fantastic. He shows us conflicts and his rivalry. I can't wait to see the next book.
B006QF61VA|5.0|I had not seen &#34;Good Morning Vietnam &#34; since its theatrical release. Thinking that my son would be old enough to appreciate it, we watched it together to both of our delights. This movie has aged gracefully. The memorable lines that had become part of our family vernacular were as good as I had remembered them, and the &#34;aha&#34; moments were more subtle than I had recalled. Robin Williams is at his maniacally best.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time! I been waiting for ever. Every week I would go to Amazon to see if they had candy crush and now the wait is over.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Actually, I really, really hated it. Another zombie movie. I can't believe I wasted money on it. Brad Pitt has had much better movies than this and maybe one or two worse [but not much worse].
B00E6890RG|5.0|Well, first off, I grew up with Yes, Crimson, Genesis, and Giant in the 70s, have played guitar for close to 5 decades, and I still find musical fascination in contemporary neo-prog music! Oh, let it be known that I have not bought a Dream Theater album for a long time, because I had noticed that the song writing had been suffering cancer-like for many years. I became tired of relentlessly boring songs and robotic-like soloing. A great prog band must rely on superb writing first, then texture it with interesting fills and creative soloing. And then in 2011 I believe, it happened! A band writing better songs than Dream Theater emerged onto the prog scene and blew everyone away! Enter: HAKEN! Their newest album, \\"The Mountain\\", is by far their most mature to date and is without a doubt, their best! Rich in fabulous melodies, shining with amazing solos and texturally aural soundscapes...true artistic sound sculpting at it's finest! I had to chuckle, in a good way...Gentle Giant-esque vocals and music are peppered throughout leading one to believe that fellow Brits GG,indeed must have been an influence here! I absolutely LOVE this album! The tunes are fresh, and all the musicians are virtuosos, yet there is NEVER overplaying or childish \\"showing off\\". The music can actually survive on its own, even without the masterful soloing! This is an album that needs to be listened to in it's entirety. Do yourself a huge favor...all you Dream Theater advocates! Abandon the \\"Dream\\", and welcome the refreshing musicalities of HAKEN into your ears, minds, and hearts.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|This is an amazing book. It brings into perspective the journey of spiritual / human growth by utilizing the tools of a modern physiologist. The insights presented in this book will truly bring about a paradigm shift in how you understand yourself in relationship to the bigger picture.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|At first nothing seemed to work. Each experiment ended in failure. But after I failed each experiment, I went back and tried again with a much different mindset. The results were amazing :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very fun and addicting. I like the candy theme in this game I have played other games similar for years and the candy theme is cute.
006202406X|4.0|If you watch The Voice, I feel like Cee Lo when no one is turning around during the Blind Auditions and he defensively says, \\"I like it,\\" as he hits his button and becomes the lone chair that spins to face the artist.<br /><br />After reading reviews for Allegiant, -avoiding spoilers, of course- I went into reading this book prepared to hate it.  I knew I would hate it. I would hate it for all of the reasons those before me hated it: there is no distinction between Tris and Four's perspective, too much kissing, there are too many rebellions, and that ending!  However, as I read and turned each page I kept waiting for my dislike of the book to begin. Sure, I found problems with the story. Obviously the readers are right, there is not distinction between Tris and Four's perspective, and I do need the chapters labeled so I can figure out whose brain I am in.  And yes, the writing is choppy and non descriptive (hence 4 stars and not 5); but all problems aside, it is still a fascinating story and concept.<br /><br />*spoilers*<br /><br />I know this book didn't end like many people wanted it to, but that what makes this book good to me.  The seasons of our lives don't always end the way we want them to. If anything, Roth's ending puts a spin on this \\"sci-fi\\" world that makes it more reminiscent of true life.  Four's reaction to the loss of Tris feels incredibly real. His perspective all of a sudden comes alive for me once she is gone. The reflection he experiences and the feeling of loss are very well done.<br /><br />Maybe it is because I am knocking on 40 and becoming very reflective, but I feel that Roth took me on a journey that reminded me of a lesson we all need to learn earlier in life: no one is all good or all bad, it is all about perspective. We all have a story that helped shape and mold us into who we are (and what we believe), and it is those around us that make all of the difference. We should always strive to surround ourselves with those that help us to be better people. Those who bring out our best qualities. Those who carry us when we cannot walk.  Those who love us when we feel unworthy of love.  I cannot tell you how much I appreciate Roth's last 2 paragraphs,  \\"Since I was young, I have always known this: Life damages us, every one. We can't escape damage. But now, I am also learning this: We can be mended. We mend each other.\\"  Yes. Again and again, yes.
0307165485|5.0|This is one of my favorite story books ever! I had this book as a kid and loved it, so I bought one for my son. The reason I love this book so much is because it is not just stories; there ae numbers, letters, colors, etc. There are lots of picture pages that simply label items on the page, different trucks, or tool, or animals for instance. the illustrations are exceptionally colorful which make it a perfect book for young children!<br />Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm addicted to this game; I just get frustrated when I have to wait for friends to give me tickets!  I spend way too much time playing!

B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Great movie with awesome special effects. Really enjoyed it. Its kind of a cross between Transformers and Godzilla. Can't go wrong with that.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite game! I was extremely excited when I discovered that I could finally have access to Candy Crush on my tablet. It allows me to have more playing time.
B00EKR61FM|5.0|Omg this is so tempting to buy I don't care if I already have the movies I own three sets of the books the movie tie paperbacks and the hardcovers so I'll probably buy this it has so many features that mine current ones don't what can I say I'm a twihard

B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I like the game, but having to be put in timeout until you can continue on is crazy. I would rather  pay a fee for the game if it meant that I could play it &quot;freely&quot;. Otherwise this game is not free.

B0092S4WLY|5.0|I couldn't go to sleep at night until I escaped from one more floor. Needless to say, this game was intriguing enough to keep me up past my middle-aged bedtime. When my teen-age son saw it, he had to get it, too. Guess it must be cool enough for the teen crowd, too!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Would not change Nothing!! Loved everyone of them. Would recommend to any body that loves a great love story!!

B009GJ870Q|5.0|Re-reading this book thirty years after the first time read has been a pleasure.<br />I have read thousands of books since my first encounter with The Godfather, but this is still the defining novel of the Mafia.<br />A powerful story and one of those few books that you don't want to put down. Mario Puzo is the consummate story teller.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I enjoyed the entire series.  Each book took a few chapters before I was really into it, but by the middle of the book I was looking for moments when I could sit and read at least a few pages.  There are things about the lifestyles of the some of the characters that I find disturbing, but that's what makes it interesting: the fact that the book is nothing like the life I choose to live.
0307477401|5.0|arrived as described. thank you. good book to read. it is very entertaining and I like the series from Henning Mankell.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I am hooked on this well written thriller.  Good as 24  Only reason to pay for Showtime  That's all folks!

B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Very good and fun app because kindle fires don't have video recorders but they have cameras so I just loved it
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Just not a game I want to play with others.  I liked some of the &#34;tutorial&#34;  &#34;bird bombs&#34;, but I play Scabble and Drawsomething w friends. Angry Birds is for passing time by myself.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I am Legend was a very good book. The only thing I did not like about it was that there were vampires, not zombies like in the movie.
0380729407|5.0|This is one of my favorite short stories by Ray Bradbury. Walt Disney was also a big fan of Bradbury's works and wanted to make SWTWC into a full length movie. This was a match made in heaven, since it took someone with Walt Disney's genius to transform and enrich Bradbury's original short story. I actually prefer the movie over the story, although I recommend reading the story first and then watching the movie. This movie is worth the purchase price and I have viewed it many times.  I especially like the themes and contrasts in SWTWC (i.e. faith vs. unbelief/anxiety; wisdom vs. rashness/recklessness; light vs. darkness; goodness vs. evil; beginnings vs. endings; youth vs. age; people's needs vs. their desires/wants---and the list goes on and on). The actors do an excellent job in the movie (Walt certainly knows how to pick the right individuals for their particular role). P.S. FYI I believe that this was the only R rated movie that Walt Disney made under the Disney label. I love literature that is not only enjoyable, but also causes you to think and reflect and learn.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Really enjoyed this book and liked the story. It kept me wanting more for sure. Only three stars because it isn't anything groundbreaking, but you kind of know what you get with a Sparks book and this one doesn't disappoint.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was a very captiviting read and I could not put down. I lost track of time and almost missed appointments.  John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and hope there will be more to this particular story.

1612680011|5.0|Just a wonderful book.  All young people need to read it.  I wish I had read this book when it first came out.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|To me, this book harkens back to the style of writing Mr. King used so adeptly in some of his earlier novels.  I am a fan of most every book I've read of King's, but this one feels sentimental to me even though it's brand spanky new.<br /><br />Simply put?  Doctor Sleep is awesome!

B005F3GMAO|5.0|One of the best business books I have ever read, even though its not packaged as one - it an autobio. Written chronologically the book exemplifies the how Richard's persona(fun,adventure,living life to its fullest etc)extends to his businesses.<br /><br />I can honestly say that his battles with BA/Lord King and the bankers represent values that business schools don't teach - tenacity/grit/perseverance and good luck(the timing of sale of Virgin Music)<br /><br />Please read the book,its thoroughly entertaining and has great insights into business

1594746036|5.0|Now 16 years old, Jacob Portman has grown up listening to outlandish tales told by his grandfather, who claims he escaped monsters as a young boy and was able to take shelter in Miss Peregrine's home. Jacob believes the monsters his grandfather was hiding from during World War II were the Nazis, but after his grandfather dies, horrifically, before his very eyes, Jacob is confronted with the truth.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs' MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN has been a bestselling children's book for a few years now, and it gets the graphic novel treatment in Cassandra Jean's stunning new adaptation. Jean's artwork, which also incorporates some of the photos used in the prose book, is simply marvelous, a wondrous adaptation of an already engrossing tale.<br /><br />Riggs grips the reader immediately as we watch Grandpa Portman regale his grandson with tales of extraordinary children doing most peculiar things. He even has pictures! But Jacob is skeptical. But after his grandfather's death, Jacob takes it upon himself to venture off to find the Welsh home that was his grandfather's refuge during the war. When he finds it, and when he learns that only he can see the \\"hollow\\" monsters, he learns what he must do in life --- and what he is really capable of.<br /><br />Readers of the prose book will find much to enjoy in this adaptation, as will new readers who have yet to discover the magic of MISS PEREGRINE'S HOME FOR PECULIAR CHILDREN. It's the perfect kind of spooky journey to take on a crisp fall day.<br /><br />Reviewed by John Hogan
B008476HBM|5.0|I have heard of this book over the years but had never read it nor seen any of the 'movies'.  What a great peek to an earlier time concerning women's role in society and their lack of property rights.  It was also a romantic read. I  watched the 1940 move with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier afterwards. This is a great pairing!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This Grisham mystery novel does not have the intrigue as his original novels did in the early part of his writing career.  Did not hold this reader's interest from beginning to end.  Rather lame.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|The game itself is fun but I didn't like the aim.  The ball should just go where you aim your finger but instead you have to drag your finger to aim the line to where you want to shoot.  For me this needed to be a fun time waster and it can't be that if I am frustrated by the basics of how to play.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Amazing information about the effects of gluten on the brain.  Everyone should try eliminating gluten from their diet and see how much better they feel and how much clearer they think.

006202406X|1.0|Knowing this book had some poor reviews, I decided to read it anyway because I was so curious to see what happened after the ending events of Insurgent. After forcing myself through this horrible book, I wish I would have listened to the other reviewers. This book is so bad that it makes me regret even starting this trilogy.<br /><br />First of all, I feel like Roth had no idea how she wanted the book to end when she began writing Allegiant. This might explain the boring plot lines that were very similar to the ones in the first book. Where she does come up with something new, she takes ideas from other popular books and movies making me feel like she used up all of her creativity on Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />Most of the book is very monotonous except for the last chapters where Roth attempts to build a little excitement. However, this excitement is short lived and I was left at the end wondering if she had gotten to the end of her page quota and just needed something to end it. I think Roth attempted to shock her readers in attempt to make her book somewhat interesting; but instead, it made the entire series seem like a waste of time.<br /><br />To make the book even worse, Roth writes each chapter alternating the point of view from Tris to Tobias. The problem is that she writes each point of view the exact same way. I would think that an 18 year old man and a 16 year girl would have different sounding inner voices. If she hadn't written their names at the top of each chapter, I would have had a really difficult time deciphering which person's point of view was being expressed.<br /><br />All in all, I agree with other reviewers when they said to skip the last book and imagine an ending for yourself. Reading this last book poisoned the entire series, which is really sad because I truly enjoyed the first two books.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was truly looking forward to the end of this trilogy but was let down. There were points during this book where k had to step away and roll my eyes. I wish the ending was different I felt like it was thrown together for shock value. I'm not one to leave a story unfinished so if you read the first two books then finish the story. If you haven't skip the series it's not worth the ending.

0312944098|1.0|I am British and all too familiar with Jeffrey Archer as a man who at a very early age had it all.  I believe he was the youngest member of Parliament ever and went on to become a Lord.  He had privilege and wealth and status; and betrayed it all.  He went to jail for perjury and perverting the course of justice and got kicked out of the Conservative party after a lifetime of deceit.  During a time when Britain had its highest ever rate of unemployment Archer publicly said that the young unemployed men simply did not want to work.  Now does all this mean he cannot write - NO, does it mean that he brings a very particular point of view to his books YES.<br /><br />Our hero in the book is unable to print his own name or read a single word after 11 years in the education system.  Come on!  Unless he was severely special needs that would never happen.  He becomes a talented mechanic destined to run his own garage, so we know he is not dumb.  Just another Archer statement.  East end lad = thick.  The fact that within two years in jail he is able to begin a university degree belies the earlier description of his intellect, but of course he is a thicko so got to be dumb.  Working class so stupid.<br /><br />The 4 baddies.  One is a barrister but totally corrupt.  Hmm I wonder if he is thinking of his own barristers?  An example of the dialog to describe him \\"he leered at her and began licking his lips\\"  Very original and articulate NOT.<br />One is an actor - guess what he is gay and conceited and totally self centered with a giant ego.<br />One is an Estate Agent (realtor) who is fat and lazy.<br />The occupation of the last eluded me but he is a drug addict.<br /><br />All 4 baddies were at University together and belonged to an exclusive club called the - wait for it - Musketeers, with the motto all for one and one for all.  Hmmm which century is this supposed to be set in?<br /><br />So, on with the tale.  Our young man is tutored in jail by a Lord!  I wonder if Archer tutored anyone when he was in jail?  LOL too silly<br />The Lord is murdered and our young eastender assumes his identity and gets out of jail, becomes a Lord and acquires estates in Scotland and a home in London then finds a stamp collection worth 57 million pounds ($80 million).  No one ever questions him such is his ability to assume the mannerisms of an ex army officer and aristocrat.  His uncle who is also a baddie constantly refers to his wife as \\"old gal\\".  I have not heard anyone use this phrase in 50 years.<br /><br />Ok by now you can tell I am ticked off by Archer and bored and dismayed by the book.  Dismayed that so many people give it a good review, but then I realize that only an English person would pick up on the nuances, which leads me to ask OMG do Americans think we really are like that??  It is full of boring stereotypes from another age, horrible class and occupation cliches and all in all utter nonsense.  I could not force myself to finish it and will never pick another Archer book up again.tutored anyone when he was in jail?

006202406X|2.0|After reading the other reviews I feel better that I was not the only one who had the reaction I had upon finishing this book. I had been looking forward to reading this book, and just spent my entire day reading it, and I feel like it was such a waste of time.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert!!**<br /><br />I do not know the reasons that VR chose to end the book the way she did, however I feel there were much better ways to end this story. After all of the struggles and the back and forth in the story lines and romance between Tris and Tobias I cannot believe that the choice was to kill her. I think that was taking the easy way out, and an attempt at a shock factor rather than taking the time to really develop an intriguing ending to the story.<br /><br />Another review made a comment about not caring about any of the possibilites that could have happened after the book finished and I feel the same way. I usually like to think of the future possibilities about the characters as I have developed a relationship with the characters through the book, and I honestly could care less, which is a very upsetting reaction to a book I so looked forward to reading.

B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I'm always amazed at the rate at which general readers will swallow poorly written, overly plotted and psychologically overwrought soap operas.  If you like that stuff, this one will fill the bill.  I do suggest you aim a little higher next time.

B00FPH6A70|5.0|I thought that this was a great film, with all the thrills and chills one wants from such a film, but minus that gore of some horror films.  I am also a huge, long time fan of Ed and Lorraine Warren and I thought it was great to see them recognized for the work that that have done for decades.

B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I highly recommend the reading of this book.  As I  was reading I could hear Malala'svoice telling me her story.  She made me feel her excitement at learning and her pain for those who would deny others the joy of learning.
030758836X|5.0|Excellent novel!. When I started to read the book I didn't felt amused about the childish writing style but that was justified by the plot. Then I understood that this wasn't the average Joe book, you could feel the characters, they weren't your iconic-cliché ones at all, they were three dimensional at many levels, you could feel that the author was exposing herself in many of the casual details. Scary

006202406X|5.0|This review contains absolutely NO SPOILERS if you've read Divergent and Insurgent.<br /><br />As some of you already know, Allegiant has generated some seriously STRONG reactions. They war on the five-star and one-star extremes. I don't provide star ratings because I dislike slating books together in a category when they are so completely different and how I felt about them was so completely different.<br /><br />In this case, I will make an exception and clarify that this was a 5-star book. I'll explain it the best I can without spoilers.<br /><br />For those who have already finished Allegiant and still have questions, Veronica Roth wrote this COMPLETELY SPOILERY End of Allegiant Explanation on her blog here: [...]<br /><br />Ok, let's get started. Some series enders feel like a rush-to-finish story where all of the loose ends are haphazardly tied together for a \\"ta-da\\" moment at the end. Allegiant is not like that at all.<br /><br />While there are certainly a ton of story lines and relationships that need resolving in this final book, Roth takes her time getting there, weaving and threading the future with the past. Tris, Tobias and their friends risk it all to see what the truth is beyond the fence and what it means for the factions and their lives.<br /><br />And that's something Roth does extraordinarily well - explain the toughest parts of life. Love, loss, heartbreak, joy and faith.<br /><br />Like this: \\"I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him be default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses. me.\\"<br /><br />Allegiant is simply filled with sparkling revelations like that one that make you want to weep with the truth of it.<br /><br />This novel stayed true to the previous books. Some feel like the end doesn't make fit in with the story as a whole, but I couldn't disagree more.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias develop even more in Allegiant and make decisions that fit in with their growth and maturity. In this book, the story became more than just factions and romance and frienships. It was about society and devastation and rebuilding.<br /><br />I loved that Allegiant had a more serious tone and stayed true to its core message: people are more than the sum total of their parts.<br /><br />This was an incredible series and more than getting a cookie-cutter, predictable ending, I got ideas. Ideas about how we live and think and about how people in the world of Divergent coped and loved and progressed. And that to me was more powerful and memorable than everything happening \\"the way it should.\\"<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />This book will make many of you sad and angry. I saw it as an authentic, harsh, beautiful way to end this amazing series. Allegiant leaves no loose ends and gifts readers with a story they will think about long after the last page is turned.ouldn't disagree more.<br /><br />Tris and Tobias develop even more in Allegiant and make decisions that fit in with their growth and maturity.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|Excellent presentation of the many angles from which to view a President's actions, where we normally get only one, or maybe two sides.  Engrossing reading packed with bits of information that were new to me.  Who knew that Europe was not only flattened at the end of WWII, but also facing a crop failure and famine, and that Truman called on Herbert Hoover to ride to the rescue?
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have enjoyed Star Trek since it was a television series, so I know that this dates me.  I did not think that anyone could match Ricardo Montalban as Khan (especially in the Wrath of Khan), yet Benedict Cumberbatch matched and surpassed the &#34;original's&#34; intensity.  The story line of the maturation of Kirk went well in having him grow up in the face of fire.  This is one movie that I am going to enjoy watching over and over (just like I have watched the Wrath of Khan over and over).  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Star Trek franchise.

B007T99ENE|4.0|I loved this book.  I identified with the characters and felt like I was included in their struggles.  I absolutely loved the ending and I feel I learned a lot about the thinking of the times and the workings of the intelligence agencies.  The writing style is one that I enjoy tremendously, Ian McEwan's language is sparse and succinct, giving the reader just enough information, but not too much.  It is a pleasure to read his work.  McEwan's empathy with his characters is heart-warming too.  He sees things from all sides.  Did I already say I loved this book?

B00FG5E03W|5.0|I was blown away by this film. It's a little mix of Cloud Atlas, Inception and Benjamin Button. Jared Leto gives an impressive performance.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first 2 books. I couldn't put them down.  I could barely get through this one. The story was repetitive and boring.  I don't know why Roth decided to take the book the way she did. All I can think is that the up coming movies swayed her decisions.<br />My advice would be to read the first 2 and make up your own ending.  This one will only disappoint you.
