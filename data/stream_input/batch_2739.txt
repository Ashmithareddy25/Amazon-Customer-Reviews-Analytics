B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really dislike how the did this app, it saps battery and has huge wastes of memory and processing speed.  And achievements?  Really?  On my weather app?  Who in the check gives a cheap about achievements when your trying to get to the weather.  I don't know who created this, but they should be embarrassed.
B00104W8T6|5.0|I bought this 5 yrs ago amd now I'm gonna comment.  This CD is awesome! I lost it a few years ago. time for a new One~
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|one things I always hated about this game is that when I messed up, I would have to undo everything until I figured out my mistake. This game shuffles the board when you get to no moves. LOVE that
B000002UC5|5.0|Not too many people are familiar with this one. They really only know &#34;Maybe I'm Amazed&#34;. I was lucky enough my mom had it when I was little. She played it alot! I grew up having fond memories listening to it. Of Course..The entire CD is AWESOME!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|kept force closing. I can even play this game. I don't have a problem with any other apps. deleted it.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This gamet really puts your mind to work.  It's fun but also makes you think.  It's one of my favorites.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love that I can make my own sound. You can overlap different sounds to the way you like. For example I like the rain mixed with soft music.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J. Cole's CD Born Sinner was great! It is amazing and unique ♡ A masterpiece. Definitely full of hits. Worth it
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Went on vacation with only the first night's lodging booked.  Used this to book each night based on where we ended up during our wanderings.  Also use in my non-vacation life to find good hotels, provide recommendations to friends, etc. Some of the reviews vary greatly, but I always try to align my analysis based on similar travelers to myself.  I find that gives the most accurate ratings for me.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|This is a silly science fiction horror movie. I would love to live in a small town out in the desert as represented in the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Not sure what they are thinking with the end of the season. Better watch and see what you think. What will happen next year?
B00BD62X14|5.0|Love listening to her music - the songs sound so French, you almost feel like you are sitting at a little bistro sipping on a glass of wine.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This movie was okay and good to watch if nothing else to do. Glad I did not go to the theater for this one.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is an addictive little app that's interesting and fun to play. There are challenges that are hard to figure out without first reading some of the numerous and useful guides on the Internet. Do yourself a favor and read these before you set out on your own and make mistakes.<br /><br />My only complaint of this app is the need too use pearls to purchase some of the plants and corals needed to complete some of the levels. The game does not provide enough of thise on a regular basis to keep up with the tasks and you have a choice of letting your reef suffer or purchasing more pearls with real money. Disney milks their fans again.
B00957T6X6|5.0|If it wasn't for limited battery power and a need for sleep I'd never put this down.  Gripping and so well written that I find myself in the story with the characters as well.  My imagination is so much more vivid that the HBO movies are a bit anti-climatic.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|This movie was a huge hit when it came out. It catapulted Robert Redford into fame and a very successful career.
B005V20JKI|2.0|This is an enjoyable game to play.  Fairly simple to learn, but challenging enough to be fun for all ages.  My kids and I used to play it quite a bit.<br /><br />HOWEVER... after owning the game for more than a year, and getting all characters and levels, there suddenly appeared the dreaded In App Purchases!  I understand developers needing to make money and, loathsome as they are, IAP are a valid way.  In fact, buying extra points to advance your progress has been around as long as I've had the game.  Had the Devs added new characters or levels, or increased abilities, it would have provided incentive for many people.  But instead, the Devs took characters and levels previously available (and previously obtained by me) and locked them away.<br /><br />BOO!<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews, and prior to this regrettable action the game would have been 5 stars from me.  However, having just returned to this game a short while ago, only to find this insidious wall hiding my previous progress?  Well, that calls for no more than a 2-star review.<br /><br />Angry Mob Games? I am disappoint.
B00005N5S5|4.0|When this first came out, I loved it. However, compared to Terminator 2 and 3,  it's actually kind of boring. However, it's a must-see because it sets the stage for the remainder of the trilogy.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|JT is the man.  Love this cd.  This was my first full cd download purchase.  Pleased with it.  Suit and tie!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|The character played by Tom Cruise discovers he has an autistic savant brother played by Dustin Hoffman. This is one of Dustin Hoffman's best roles ever.
B0013816GK|5.0|Bravo, what an operatic requiem, Carlo Giulini 's direction makes this version  theater.  This version is well balanced.  You will find  many reviews here that are more refined in analysis and they in turn were determinative in my getting trying this CD.  This CD is good and makes a listener believes he or she has heard this music many times before. This CD created for me an immediate familiarity with this requiem I associate with  &#34;warhorse&#34; works. I know what is coming and I still get exited.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|This action-packed, part 2 of The Terminator trilogy is probably my favorite of the three. The special effects were unbelievable for its time. Linda Hamilton does a great job as John Connor's bad-ass mother. And nobody could play The Terminator better than Arnold!
B00838HRP2|2.0|Shortly after ordering I received a friendly email from seller and they said they were from Germany.  Not a big deal, but kind of wondered why it was mentioned....When the DVD arrived I had to change Regions on my computer to view it and you can only do this a few times.  I essentially paid allot of money to watch a DVD 5 times. I think this should have been made clear, feel more than slightly ripped off...I think maybe Amazon should be monitoring their sellers better??? Have since read lots of similar reviews, those with blu ray players could not even watch it once....
0792846443|5.0|Kathy Bates plays &#34;the #1 fan&#34; of a best-selling author played by James Caan. However, her moods and the way she treats him can change in a split-second. The first time I watched it, I thought it was somewhat twisted. However, I've seen this movie a few times and it gets funnier each time. Unless you've seen it,  you wouldn't understand.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|I can't say how bad it was, the wife and I gave up on it after about half an hour.  Either the last 2/3rds of the movie was awesome or it's one log slow slog.
0061906220|5.0|During story time at library my grandson heard this book for the first time.  Now wants it read every week when we attend.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Hard for us soccer moms to fathom.  What a tough spot for every parent.  Well written.  Did not know what would finally happen until the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love playing this game when I'm sitting around with nothing to do.  I turn the game on and before I know it an hour or two has gone by
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Fun Movie even for and &#34;oldster&#34; and I'm not sure why, if I am reviewing this, I am required to use &#34;x&#34; amount of words.  If my first sentence is not enough, then I think I will skip reviews in the future.....Just sayin...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Just enough drama to make it interesting...not so much that it becomes a soap opera... great way to spend an hour...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|And so do I! Easy UI and the minions are interactive and fun. My daughter is 8 and she can play this for hours.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is awesome! What a great way to bring these stories together! I don't think we ever got an answer to who would win!
B008KWTF2O|5.0|I am going to live with my natural curl from now on and this book is inspriring me to do so.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun way to escape and challenge yourself.  The challenges are not too obvious and each is different enough to keep you engaged.
B008602KQI|3.0|Well, the previews made it look entertaining and my friends that had seen it said they enjoyed it so I watched it.<br />Unfortunately, it was highly predictable and really just kind of stupid.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I started this book with high expectations but it seems to go nowhere. Some guy dies of a heart attack and there is a poor socialist suburb and a nice town and after many many pages I am done. I don't like the characters they are boring and the story is going no where fast. or should I say, slowly. To add to this is the fact that this story is taking place in England and the idiosyncrasies of the British dialogue and mannerisms isn't charming it is also boring. I can imagine getting back into it.  I do have to say in all honesty I have just been on a Stephen King Bender and have read several of his including, Cell, Full Dark No Stars,Fire Starter, the Dome, Joyland, Plus Dan brown's the Inferno which I can recommend  all of the above highly. I also read the Trilogy by Heitzmann the Michelli  Family, While not a Stephen thriller it was a very nice story and I wanted more so ended up reading all three. Her characters are likeable and developed quickly in the story unlike Rowling. Now that I think of it I never did finish the 3rd Harry Potter book and never bothered with the others after that.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a great hidden object / find the differences game. I have it on my phone and sometimes it's a little hard to see because of the smaller screen, but that's true of all these games. This one is a lot more fun than most and has lots of levels.
193700788X|1.0|It was so terrible I didn't finish the book. I loved this series so much that I preordered every book and finished reading them within 24 hours.  I stopped around page 150 in this one. All the one star reviews express how I felt. One of the worst written and boring books ever. How did this book get pass her editor and her agent? If I could give it no stars I would.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I usually don't browse the web during work hours but Wednesday was such a slow day I just had to go to my favorite weblog, Lifehacker, in the afternoon to read the latest articles just to pass the time and that's when I found out Google unveiled the Chromecast that day and it was available to purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />I immediately login to my Amazon account and buy a Chromecast while it was still in stock, just 2 hours before they removed the Netflix offer, and my only regret is not ordering more than one unit. It's a good thing I didn't wait to place my order after work!<br /><br />I've always wanted to stream content from my laptop to my TV without having to use an HDMI cable or buy a set-top box that requires me to use another remote and I wasn't ready to spend hundreds of dollars to upgrade my laptop and buy a WiDi dongle so $35 for the Chromecast was a no-brainer for me.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Johnson's writing invokes an entire universe, unknown, terrifying,magical and woven throughout with the power of undying love.  You will feel as though you spent many years in North Korea and at the same time that you imagined it all.  Absolutely one of the best books  I have read.
B00932A4XE|3.0|This movie is mildly entertaining.  My wife and I were pregnant with out second child and thought we would find the topical humor over the top.  Most of the funny scenes were featured in the previews, and I really think this movie would have been better with a cast of unknowns or at least actors which weren't as well-known.  The plot was disjointed and could have been better structured to comically feature the joys and fears of pregnancy.  Bottom line:  I was disappointed with the movie, disappointed with the performance of the cast, and thankful I didn't waste money to see it in theaters.
B005V5WBFG|1.0|this item is only free to download for 14 days,this seems to be false advertising(beware)I think all terms should be disclosed from prior to download or did i miss something?
0062255657|2.0|I was very disappointed in this novel. Read 10 pages and put it down. I'm glad to know that some other readers agree. I tend to have little patience unless I am drawn to a novel in the first few pages.
B00A83075M|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my 6 yr old niece.  I have no idea what the &#34;Wreck  it Ralph&#34; series is about, but she said she likes it and that's good enough for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked it!<br />It is never slow or pauses, and even though it takes a while to load, it s awesome.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Exciting!  Good against bad!  A very enjoyable movie where happiness reigns in the end.  The humor is well thought out and continuous throughout the movie.
B000IEXVCC|3.0|I expected more of a mystry movie rather than a fantasy type eerie lesbian movie.  Actually quite disipointed with the whole plot
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Hope to see what happens when you get the second half of this article is about the same thing as well and a
B003NTSBUG|3.0|It was kind of eerie without the suspense of a Alfred Hitchcock flair.  Hopefully there are no existing islands in the USA for the insane lile that but maybe I am a bit nieve
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved this book! So funny and so much &#34;behind the scenes&#34; info. Really enjoyed learning the back story behind 30 rock as well.
B0045IPOPE|5.0|Fantastic vision of the war zone and its depiction of who was the real enemy.  Everyone appeared to be the enemy if they needed to
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is an awesome product plenty of room and great construction a very good price you can not beat. The only problem I had is I'm kinda big in the arms and chest and it's kinda tight if the straps were a bit longer it would have rated a 5 stars. But I definitely like it a lot
B00464AVXW|3.0|It was a little more violent am macabre for me.  it was almost to much to take.  I did think Kevin Spacey played the roll as wellas anyone could
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is a addictive way to waste time! This game has you thinking on the spot constantly and challanges your eyes every seccond! I suggest you get this game!
B004EF4J40|4.0|Very good... if you like English 18th/19th century stories... but this is not Austen!<br /><br />I was not wild about the lead female although she did a good job... and definitely not horribly cast... she is attractive... but not to the degree the the script requires or... kept referring to her as.<br /><br />The male lead was perfect... .<br />The movie itself is obviously a retelling of the birth of industry and horrible working etc. conditions BUT... it gives a good and surprisingly fair assessment of the real problems of both the small industrialists at the time... always at the mercy of the marketplace and another class of bankers etc. above them.<br /><br />Especially the movie deals superbly as a study in a man who pulls himself up within this cauldron... after the standard family fall... whose heart is good, which realities make it impossible to indulge...  who too can only go forward in the realities which he finds himself and prides himself on doing just that.<br /><br />Our introduction to him is witnessed by the female lead while the man is beating a worker brutally and it is filmed that way... this is where the movie and story soars... no BS here... but there is a reason... . He makes no apology at any time for his actions and in fact one is won over to a degree to the potions of both labor and ownership learning again that... technology driven changes are selective forces for the human race... and that there are times when our humanity fall far behind our race's inventions.<br /><br />I ended up likely and respecting the man.<br /><br />The Romance itself is believable. The lead male character's mother is extremely well cast and acted... even her... I warmed to as a women.<br /><br />The sister of the male lead is the only flaw in the movie. I have not read the book but she is played here as a ditzy blond... something that clearly too often comes from Jewish sensibilities in politics and in comedy. Before you react think about the statement no matter you background Here this character is overacted, that is... not well directed. You could have cut her dullness and selfishness in half and made the point better... as Jane Austen would have done... .<br /><br />A long evening if you watch all of them but highly recommended... for the male lead and the themes not often seen in the cartoon propaganda of 20th and now 21st Century political corralling. Males will like it I predict too.<br /><br />One other thing... the comparison to Jane Austen... a later period of course and revolutionary changes have befell... the social contract of England; technological changes are fracturing the agrarian social mix of nobility/middle classes/gentleman's families... and those that keep them in the lives they love. The \\"poor\\" in Austen are barely dealt with and it is a weakness of her stories. But that was not her theme.<br /><br />So although it is still England in North and South of course...and Jane's England at around 1800 was changing... they are very different countries... cut apparently by a 'north south' sensitivity. The latter is an aspect that I was only vaguely aware of... so another reason to watch the movie... and its very strong historical theme is a great attraction to an American not aware of some of the particulars of region in England.<br /><br />NO... Jane Austen is better, BUT again the writer is good too and should be congratulated for a more even handed treatment of a far more difficult period socially... and a period that contemporary propaganda allows us all... rarely a forum... to discuss evenhandedly, with wisdom so loaded is the lore of Marxism/Capitalism et. al. .<br /><br />Much of the appeal of Austen is her subtle, biting but empathetic... observations about human interaction and real motivations... of classes specifically but also how people are victims of personal circumstances more often than their cartoon political representations allow... and that the real nobility of the soul... no matter where onefinds it is what all humans long for... that and a \\"fortune!\\"<br /><br />The absolute gulf between landed classes, gentlemen... and peasants... no matter their circumstances... and prejudices that ARE falling to the realities of the time, this too of course, is all Austen. For Jane's England is changing... and what is on the horizon... which... we see here in \\"North and South,\\" will fracture much of what we love about Jane Austen's world. But it too is a period when people are segmented into ridged classes based most often still... on birth.
B0011UGLK6|5.0|This book was so rich and so textured...I savored every word.  Lahiri is my favorite author and I am anxiously awaiting her next work.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|THE EMPEROR'S SOUL is one of those books that breaks the mold and resonates with deeper truths and originality long after you read it -- at least it did for me.  It's about art and thievery, about truth and deception and the very thin line between them.  It creates a new culture and viewpoint -- but very grounded in Asian culture and history.  (I made a gift of a copy to a curator of Asian art for these reasons.  :))  I wish I could read it again -- for the first time -- so I could (re)discover this amazing story ...  Please Brandon -- write more in this world, with these kinds of characters...  When is the movie going to be made?  :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I do love this app. Some of the new features are great and it looks more sleek and modern. I would love to be able to get an hourly forecast but for all I know I just haven't figured out how to yet. I love the radar and how easy to read the newest version is. Thank you for making getting the weather so quick and easy.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Pre-adolescent boys might like this, but for all its surface action, the story drags on so slowly it like running through molasses. The characters are silly.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't know what to say. I don't think I can put in to words how I feel. A beautiful love story, I don't think I ever cried so hard reading a book before. I read it in one setting. I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what happened with Gus and Hazel.
0786838655|5.0|I thought this book was a fun, entertaining adventure for the young adult reader, or really any age reader, that brings in elements of Classical Mythology in a new and fresh way.  Everybody knows (or should know) the different stories of the Greek Myths.  However, Greek  Mythology can be sort of, um, dry, like dust.  But, while we follow this hero's adventures and learn along with him and his friends about the different personalities of the different gods and the different stories that go along with them, we learn that these Gods are not just old stone statues with old moldy tales.  They are cool and they are happening now!<br /><br />Once you understand all the relationships and background between all the different characters, you can understand why the Gods (and Titans, and other assorted mythological beasts) do some of the stuff they do.  I wish I had as good a grasp on the subject when I was taking the classics in college.<br /><br />As Percy is learning about the new world he is now part of, we learn about it right along with him.  There are inventive and semi-plausible explanations for just about everything.  For example, the \\"Mist\\" that disguises the magical aspects of the world from us mortals, while the gods, demi-gods or heroes, monsters, and other \\"real\\"  characters see what's really there.  For instance, all the other students at Percy's school see Mrs. Dodds as a cranky old substitute math teacher, but Percy knows that she is not human.  We find out she is really a Fury, who usually perches on the back of Hades' throne.<br /><br />There are so many funny, imaginative ways that the author explains different magical phenomena so that they make perfect sense, you just accept them and keep going without another thought.<br /><br />I really recommend this book.  Not only as a solid, entertaining read, but also as an introduction to classical mythology.  If, after reading The Lightning Thief, there is more interest in greek mythology, I suggest:<br /><br /> [ASIN:0440406943 D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths]
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I am pleasantly surprised with the new screens and the way all of the info is shown. I wasn't aware that there would be a change in the delivery of this site but it's a nice surprise. And the chance to get points for offers is a great idea.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved it.  Sure, it was a little slow in a few spots, but overall it was a fast paced and exciting ride.  If anyone had told me that an author could keep me entertained while describing the journey of two people down some stairs I'd have laughed in their face!  Well, Howey did just that.  He has a real talent for developing a character, getting you engaged and then killing them.  No, that is NOT a bad thing.  It is great writing and story telling.  He is unpredictable and one excellent author.  Fortunately he several other books available and I cant wait to get them and devour them as well.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Every thing was as promised.  The merchandise was in excellent shape and the seller was prompt with service as advertised and packaged so even USPS couldn't tear it up.  It is nice to have your expectations met and exceeded in your first couple of forays of internet commerce.  Well Done all!!!  My daughter is showing it at her book clubs meeting as they finish each book, and they are all enjoying the sensation of seeing what they just read.

B000LB7G00|5.0|The SpaceNavigator 3D Mouse is an excellent product.  After I learned to use the 3D mouse, I found I was working twice as fast.  Using the 3D mouse allows me to navigate with one hand, while using the other to access a tool.  That's like combining two steps into one.  This is one of the smartest purchases I ever made, and I'm happy to report that all my major programs...Modo, Poser, Photoshop...all support the SpaceNavigator.  Now, I don't like to model without using the 3D mouse.  It's a definite five-star winner.  :-) Try it, you'll like it!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Okay so once this movie was on the movie Chanel I watched it. Then I became obsessed. I like the books better than the movie. Acting was good. But in the movie they had Katniss get the mockingjay pin at the hob then she gives it to Primrose( her sister)  to protect her. In the book Katniss gets it from her friend Madge( the pin belongd to Madge's Aunt( Massiley Donner) who was in another Hunger Games and she lost. Most people complain about kids killing kids. The killing thing came after a place on known as north America broke into 13 districts that each specialize in something ex. Lumber, power, luxury, masonry, cattle, fishing, etc. And the Capitol (not part of the districts) takes 2 kids from each district. And have them fight to the death until a lone Victor remains the Capitol does this to tell the now 12(district 13 got blown up) that the Capitol will always be stronger and have more power.  Hopefully now you understand why kids are killing kids.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The apps are great on both my Nexus 7 (2013) and Windows 8 laptop. Youtube and Netflix both play video in 1080p and using your device as a remote is almost as responsive as a real remote. I did have some issues with the youtube app on my laptop; sometimes a video ad would play on my laptop and when the ad was done I would no longer have control over the video that was being played on the Chromecast.<br /><br />The function to automatically turn on the tv did not work for either my tv, which is a few years old, or my parent's tv, which is a few weeks old.<br /><br />The laptop screen share essentially works as a wireless hdmi cable, but it has a few expected flaws. Initially, my router was upstairs and I was testing on my middle floor, and it was impossible to screen share a video. It was far too laggy and glitchy (testing on South Park Studios and HBO Go). I then moved the router down to the middle floor and placed it near my tv, and the performance was greatly improved to the point where I was able to stream video. Even though the performance was improved, I would rather just stream video with a cable under most circumstances. The screen sharing resolution is also maxed out at 720p. Hopefully more content providers will make their own apps, which clearly perform better than the screen sharing.<br /><br />The Chromecast is nice for laptops/desktops and incredible for mobile devices. The ability to starting playing a video, then turn off your screen or start doing something else is not possible with just a hardwired connection (for mobile).<br /><br />There are a few things that I still haven't tested, such as multiple mobile devices queueing up a Youtube playlist, but overall for only $35 I highly recommend it. Google has publicly released the SDK, so it's only going to get better.

B000EUDAWG|1.0|Got this as gift, and it barely works. You pretty much have to stand right over it with the remote to get it to run...<br /><br />Dont waste your hard earned money on this...
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I didn't see an option to view the Chrome browser from my nexus 4 or nexus 7. I was able to view my desktop version of Chrome and the view is very poor quality. Tried Pandora and the sound is extremely choppy. Tried the YouTube app from nexus 4 and nexus 7 device and again the video is just poor. Playing music seems to be fine. Shows the image of the cover album on the screen. No options to show images like AppleTV. Did not try Netflix because Google stopped the 3 month trial.<br /><br />[video quality update] Video quality from YouTube seems to be fine. I don't see an option to play different resolutions for the video but maybe the fist time it tries the lower resolutions. I don't normally watch YouTube on my Nexus 7 but I did buy the Chromecast so that I can play YouTube on my TV. Maybe I don't know the app very well but I don't see a way to change the quality like on the desktop version. Seems to be working fine now. I expect the quality to up and down I guess. Gave another star to the product.<br /><br />[Netflix update] I was one of the lucky ones to meet the order deadline and did receive the code a week later. I'm a new Netflix user and one of the reasons I wanted this device. I don't know where I've been but Netflix is great. But this is a Chromecast review so I'll say the video quality is great and didn't have any streaming issues. I've only used the Netflix app and don't know what the video management is in a browser. I quick look at the browser version seems to have more features and options and seems like the app has the bare minimum for now. I'm thinking with time the app will be enhanced. Gave another star to the product.
B0026KX6TY|4.0|An excellent tale of a prodigy. The actors are great, especially the young Pomeranc and Sir Ben Kingsley. Lawrence Fishburn is also wonderful in his role. A fascinating perspective into the world of competitive chess and the life of the enigmatic Bobby Fischer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I cannot describe how amazing this book is. Go read it. Now. It has depth. It has meaning. GO READ IT
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Used to play this decades ago in the Dell Crossword magazines, although it was called by another name. Love it because you need logic and a little math to solve. The app itself is laid out well and easy to use. Great job!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So many shades of gray pretending they are color, this book is a rainbow that dares anyone to think that there is simply black versus white. The author's skill in storytelling is evident, although there are moments when what is foreshadowed seems too plain. Still, when the moment happens and the deed is written as done, the exquisite joy tinged ever so subtly with sadness takes hold: Yes! A Rainbow of Grays--There are no winners in The Hunger Games, and so the book mirrors life. Every victor has losses with which to contend. Well done.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We did not watch these as they were on.  We have enjoyed watching the entire season at 2 or 3 sittings.  We also ordered Seasons 1 and 3.
0307950689|5.0|I love Dan Brown's books and recommend them highly.  They are fast paced and keep you involved.  I particularly liked this one as it taught me so much about the symbols in Washington.  He is an excellent writer.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|There are not enough words to describe the warm, heartbreaking story of Hachi and his owner and their bond that stretches beyond the grave and leaves the viewer crying in dispair but unable to turn away from the screen, and unable to pass up any attempt to revisit the tale.  Gorgeous and underrated, I am tearing up now, just remembering it again.  A masterpiece for dog lovers and anyone with a heart.
B008OTTSX4|5.0|All songs were played at high quality level and each artist put his own music style, but  playing the original Deep Purple creation.<br />Very, very good.
0062238868|1.0|I'm a submarine veteran of the Cold War, for what that's worth.<br />I found this book to be self-absorbed, racist, and myopic, as well as poorly written. I think I can take refuge in the notion that most SEALs are not like this.<br />I'm giving it one star because I can't give it less.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Wasn't completely satisfied but overall it was good. I felt like certain things at the end should have been fleshed out more.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|This game is cool bro. I'm a Tom boy and don't like girly stuff but this is neat you should try it!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby was having a really hard time learning to use a pacifier.  I read reviews on this product and saw others saying it helped their babies to have something to hold onto, so I decided to check it out.  It is awesome!  My baby was able to figure out how to hold onto the toy to keep the pacifier in her mouth, and then learned to keep it in through sucking.  Now at 5 months, she loves to hold and pet this as a lovee, and she chews on all of the monkeys limbs when she isn't in the mood to suck on the pacifier. Definitely a favorite toy in our house!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It was a great movie and we enjoyed it very much! It's got great car car chases and only one suggestive scene.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|I ordered this movie for my grandson who had never seen the part one.  He loves it and has watched it many times already
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the game is good but on my kindle fire it lags a lot and freezes up. I have only had it one day and had to force close when it froze up. other than that it is a very good game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|In this review, I will focus on a feature that has not been covered well by other reviewers. In Google's introduction of the chromecast device, they showed how they could press the chromecast button in the youtube app on smartphone and the TV would automatically turn ON and switch to the correct input to play the youtube video. I can confirm that it works exactly like they demoed. It is pretty impressive :-)<br /><br />There a few things you need to do to make it work. Firstly you have to enable the HDMI-CEC feature on your TV. HDMI-CEC is marketed under different names by different manufacturers. Panasonic calls it Viera-Link, Onkyo calls it RIHD and Toshiba calls it Regza link. You will have to read your TV manual and find out how to enable HDMI-CEC correctly in the TV settings. For my Panasonic TV, I set the \\"Viera Link\\" to \\"ON\\" and \\"Power on Link\\" to \\"Yes\\". The \\"power on link\\" setting allows the chromecast device to Turn ON the TV when you send a video to the chromecast device. Also, for the chromecast device to Turn ON the TV, it should be plugged in directly to a power outlet using the included adapter. If you power chromecast though the USB port on your TV, it will lose power when you switch OFF the TV. Chromecast device with no power cannot turn ON the TV. Make sure you turn OFF everything after changing the settings to test the Auto power ON functionality.<br /><br />After you setup the TV as described above you can send the video to TV and chromecast will turn it ON and switch the input to the one you have plugged the chromecast device into.<br /><br />For users who have an Audio Video Receiver (AVR), the above setup may not be the best. I could set up the TV to send audio to the receiver through Audio Return Channel(ARC). But for some reason ARC would pass through only stereo sound. Not the DD+ 5.1 sound from Netflix. I don't know if this is an inherent limitation of ARC. Also, after watching a youtube video, switching back to cable TV is a pain. You haveto manually switch the input on the TV and the receiver.<br /><br />So in my final setup, I plugged in the chromecast device directly into the receiver. With this setup I can receive DD+ 5.1 sound from Netflix movies. With this setup, chromecast can automatically turn ON the receiver and switch to the correct input on the receiver. Note that you have to have the HDMI-CEC functionality enabled on the receiver for chromecast to be able to turn on the receiver and switch the input. Thanks to Mr. Godwin for pointing out that you can use the HDMI-CEC functionality on the receiver to turn On the TV itself. So your chromecast can turn ON the receiver and your receiver could in turn switch ON the TV. I couldn't get my receiver to turn ON the TV. But it has nothing to do with the chromecast device itself.<br /><br />One another benefit of plugging chromecast into the receiver is that you don't have to turn the TV ON if you just want to listen to google music or audio from youtube videos through your receiver. Since my TV does not get turned ON when the receiver is turned on, I can chromecast a song or youtube video from a different room and it will turn ON just the receiver and play the music. The best part is that it doesn't drain my battery as the video is not playing on the phone and hence I do not need to keep the screen on.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with chromecast. As others have mentioned, the setup was incredibly easy and trouble free. I was pleasantly surprised that a 1.0 device worked so well out the box.<br /><br />I think Google made a smart move by creating the hardware for Google cast and integrating that functionality into two of the most used video apps youtube and netflix. If they had introduced the googlecasting protocol in Android and left it up other manufacturers to implement this feature, it would have met the fate of Google TV, Miracast etc. Now that there is a reference implementation where Google has shown what a good experience looks likethird party manufacturers and app makers will take this and run with it. I am excited about the future possibilities.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Enjoyed this first season of Orphan Black.  It's intriguing and the main actress is amazing.  I can't wait to see Season 2!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kids love this game. when u cant have a horse in real life this is the next beet thing.
B004LQI0HE|2.0|The book had a subtle feel dealing with the love story and allows a frame to examine the moral implications of bio-technology. The movie hits you over the head with the love story and misses the deeper meaning of the novel. Missed the point entirely.<br /><br />Remains of the Day is a much better movie from Ishiguro's earlier book. Watch that if you want to see a movie. Never Let Me Go is better left to be read.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Thrilling movie has great actors. Would recommend  anyone who likes thrilling and exciting movies to see this movie. Like it.
034553154X|5.0|Overall I love the artistic style of each painting. I love the chapter moments that were chosen, and its always nice to see all our favorite characters come to life in a drawing/image type medium. Already per-ordered 2014!
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|I found this movie was interesting to watch and easy to understand.  Sort of a laid back and a  good movie with out so much drama.  Not for the young but the young at heart. I loved that it is a true story.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|Great movie about triumph over pursicution and the will to survive. And the power and compassion that one man had to do what was right. A must buy. Share with others.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I am not always into these type of movies, but will stay this one surprised me. Liked enough to say I didn't waste my money. Sat back and watch a very well done movie.
B00AEFY5MK|4.0|I watched the movie with my 16 year old daughter who had never seen it before, but she knew some of the songs so she could relate to them. I was a good time we both had.
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Movie had some good and bad moments, sad and happy, I felt for the characters.  Liked it enough to finish watching it.
B00144VBBS|5.0|AS ALWAYS, ONE OF MY FAVORITE ENTERTAINERS !!<br />HE'S REAL FUNNY TOO !! I LIKE HIS RECENT STUFF MORE<br />BUT HIS EARLY YEARS IS WHAT MADE HIM WHO HE IS TODAY !!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Enjoyed everything about this movie.  Very exciting movie.  There are not many movies I would watch twice, but this one I would.
0802473156|5.0|This book has been helpful.  It puts you outside of the situation and helps you understand others feelings and motivations.  It gives the reader a greater sense of empathy for their partner.  I would recommend this book over many others in this genre.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Cool and challenging to pass the time. You really find yourself exploring and trying to figure out how parts of the puzzle are related.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Awesome book for all the homicidal maniacs on your Christmas list. Nice light read leisurely paced and lots of gore and incest. Fun for the whole family.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love this show and was glad I was able to watch all of season two before the new season premiered on USA!!
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Her voice is beautiful! I love the old songs and her versions are very special! For one so young she has a very old soul!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome. It's as if I own a real life horse. I love and care for my horse daily. And this game is free!!!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|Very suspenseful, a really good read. Baldacci keeps you on the edge of your seat with all the twists and turns in the story. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good suspenseful spy story.
B000L53D4O|1.0|It's unsteady, and the activities are way to simple! Would not recommend it to  anyone! Was a waste of money!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and l love it so much I wonder ways the next place I'm getting tired of Paris we should go to Mexico that would be fun
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This dude thinks outside the box. He is not your typical rapper. A very creative person with a brilliant mind.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I LOVE ADAM LAMBERT and the album is great! Lots of upbeat fun to dance to music! Of course it doesn't beat seeing him in person:)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show but the books are always better. I enjoyed getting inside the minds of the characters. I'm hooked! Onto book two...
B00CLMA3HK|5.0|Quest of the Hybrid, part of the Aurora Conspiracy Trilogy, by Ginger Gelsheimer and Christina Keats, is a great book. It's difficult to give it the review it deserves, while at the same time avoiding spoilers. Giving away the book's plots and twists would be like snatching presents away from the readers, rather than allowing them to open all the delicious surprises in this book.<br /><br />Jesse and James Proctor, brother and sister, inherit the legacy of the Proctor Curse. Their best friend is Marcus, who also taught Jesse to fly. When Jesse and Marcus fly off to follow clues in their quest to solve the mystery, they leave James behind. As James ignores the evidence of his own eyes to find Jesse and Marcus, the plot thickens.<br /><br />The characters are well-developed, and I found myself liking and cheering for the protagonists. As the story progresses, they learn the value of friendship, love, and never giving up on a goal.<br /><br />I strongly recommend the book.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|If you like Johnny Depp you will like this movie.  It's fast paced and funny and will have you laughing out loud with Depp's particular humor and style.  Bizarre and outrageous characters abound, and just a good story that you won't have to do much thinking about.
B000AP04NI|5.0|Great movie, great cast, wonderful music. Prompt delivery and disk in terrific shape. Leaves you with a great feeling and many tunes to sing.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I bought a digital copy of this album and I have to say it's good to have the original Justin back. The beats are the perfect mix of old and new styles, with some amazing lyrics. I'd recommend this album to anyone, especially a JT Fan.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|Who could dislike this film? It's perfect for all audiences and the actors wonderful. A good bird's eye view of how things were in the mid-west of days long gone by. Most enjoyable.
B008JFUNYG|2.0|I give Evil Dead remake two stars for the nasty gore factor, but that's about it. Furthermore, it's too dumb, too cliched to stand on it's own merit. Maybe it's just me or lack thereof, of sleep but, I almost  dozed off on this one,  for me, being a true horror fan my attitude was like been there done that. The first thing that was wrong with the remake is it wasn't any fun, not even scary, it was all serious business from here, not like the classic original were it was fun scary and campy. The actors were decent enough with what they had been given but, please no more remakes, of classic horror movies. Furthermore, for the most part they don't workout and they never seem to capture the quality or eeriness of the original; sometimes they do but, not very often. Very dissapointed. P.S. Just because you have alot of gore and bloodshed in a movie, should not makeup for a lack of story line.
B002NZK5TG|4.0|Gives the original a run for its money. Great special effects, great cast. Adults and kids will find this film a lot of fun.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I only knew about Tesla through whispers, but after reading this I've discovered a man who changed the world. While not an in depth prostrate of Tesla, this book is a great gateway into the life of a man who's ideas outlined our lives today
B009R659L8|5.0|Always interesting reads.  The short, fast pace is easy to draw you in.  Always surprises in her books.  Looking forward to her next.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good read! I Hope they make a movie out of it. I recommend this book to all of my friends.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Very appropriate for my 5 & 7 year old grandchildren.  They loved it and the music.  Looking forward to Rio 2.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|So Summer's almost over, a few Big Hollywood Productions Tanked at the Box office, and this little Gem came out on top a couple weeks ago. Made on a budget of under 50 million, not quite sure. Anyways James Wan knows horror! The movie itself is a nice throw back to the 70s horror. If you want a good old fashion movie with scares here and there definitely check this out. There were scenes that just made my palms sweaty and holding my breath at some points. The prologue, setting up the story of the Warrens and what they do; interviewing a couple of nursing students about their doll Annabelle.... OMG, those scenes were just so nerve jangling! I agree with some of the other reviewers this is probably Wan's best film to date. I did like Insidious too and Dead Silence. And Friday Sept 13th we get Insidious Chapter 2!!! This was the Best film of July 2013!
B0072OFM28|1.0|They should have killed them all off after the Prequel.<br /><br />After the fabulous 1st season and then the surprisingly bawdy and entertaining Prequel, Season 2 was darn good, but Season 3 should have never been made. It just drags and drags.<br /><br />Overall the series was uneven but entertaining - but season 4 was just awful. They should have just killed everyone off in 1 final 2 hour Finale episode and been done with it.<br /><br />Buy the DVD set it if you have all the other seasons just so you have the whole set... but for not other reason.<br /><br />Really.
1451695195|5.0|It was really amazing the way he described heaven.  Also, the scientific bases he used were very believable. Towards the end, it got a little too &#34;scientific&#34; for the average reader.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I liked this from the time that it came out on old dos computers. i think the grandkids will also enjoy  this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games that make you think and be observant so this app is a home run! the only thing it lacks is more rooms! bring 'em on!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's very addicting, I've played it since I first got my kindle fire and I haven't stopped playing it since. I definitely recommend this app, it's a fun game.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|The music this man sings just hits my soul.  I love to sit and listen to every word and the music just grabs you in the heart.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I have read many times. The classic romance that Mrs. Austen created is a work of genius that anyone who enjoys classic literature will love.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Nemo has to build a reef for a class project and his dad helps him along the way and makes you just not want to stop playing the game!!! Great game.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my Grandson.  He loved it.  The graphics were wonderful.  The condition of the used DVD was exceptional.<br />Disney creates wonderful DVDs.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a great book that I would recommend to everyone. So full of suspense it kept me turning the page. I loved it!!!
B0002NRQTS|5.0|Excellent,I can,t stop listen to it, one of there best works.I would recomend this CD. It is a must buy
B005LAIISA|5.0|Was very happy with the condition of the movie since it was used.  My kids love the Ice Age movies and would buy from this company again.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is the first book I have read on the horrors perpetrated by the North Korean government on its own citizens.  The lack of moral outrage exhibited by the world toward North Korea is stunning and disappointing.  Shin's story of his life in the labor camp, his escape, and his permanent scars - physical, moral, and psychological - is a very moving indictment of North Korea and of the world which has failed to bring down this horrible regime.  However, even for those who are not politically interested, this is a very moving and thought provoking story of how human beings survive and of the terrible costs of survival.  My only complaint is some of the &#34;filler&#34; material inserted to flesh out the story is not well-integrated and seemed to be included only to fill pages, which is why I have given this a four star rating rather than five.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Was very happy with the condition of the movie since it was used.  My kids love the Ice Age movies and would buy from this company again.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm not sure what GOOGLE is up to...<br /><br />Here is a USB type stick that has a few APPS on it and allows you to bring in Netflix, You Tube and a few other APPS on your TV.  So what.<br /><br />Most TV's already have the same APPS.  For $49 to $59, you can also buy a Blu-Ray DVD player (lower-end models) and enjoy NetFlix, You Tube and a slew of others.<br /><br />ROKU USB sticks allow me to add or delete APPS with ease.  My Sony TV does the same.<br /><br />Here is where GOOGLE really stuck it to customers:<br /><br />They offered 3 months of NEXFLIX free along with your $35.00 purchase of the GOOGLE CHROMECAST MEDIA PLAYER.  However, the next evening, they recinded the offer, affecting thousands of customers that had already purchased it online.<br /><br />The USB stick needs a cord and power from the wall so it gets no points for being user-friendly.  Plus, while they claim you can stream material directly from your laptop or smartphone, it sadly has a range of just 20 feet on a wireless basis.<br /><br />Stay with ROKU or Apple or better yet, go grab a Panasonic Blu-Ray DVD player which is loaded with the same APPS plus a dozen others plus can play your Blu-Rays at the same time.<br /><br />A lously and sub-standard launch.  Not worth the $35.00 despite the demand.  That demand will quickly end.
B004N7977I|5.0|Have always loved this movie, and now my boys love this movie too!  Thank you Amazon for always having what we need!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|The book is extremely well written, and the many details about life in North Korea educating. But I had trouble concentrating while reading. The author roamed all over the place, and so did my attention. I would read several pages & then get restless because I found it difficult many times to follow the thread of the story. I would need to put the book away for awhile & then come back to it. The bottom line is I enjoyed the book overall, and respect the author's writing skills, but it took me longer to read this book than most others.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|I like this because your like flying a real rc plane.  But the graphics in the background were very bad.  Also you need to buy extra planes.  :(
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I love, love, love these books.  I just read a Travis McGee, but Reacher is still my favorite.  This one is especially good, but they're all good!!!
B00DCX08MW|4.0|I like it because you get to fly an old plane.  Plus you get to go on missions.  It is cool
B00BYISQTO|5.0|They have a sound unlike any other, especially the baritone sung lyrics. If you like the National you'll love it. If your new to them it would be a great starting point. They are growing as a band and the songs reflect that.<br />Enjoy!

He remembers his friend Lettie, and her mother and grandmother, who live in an old house on a pond, which Lettie calls an ocean .

B004J4WNL2|2.0|I found this book a bit boring considering it really didn't open my eyes to anything new.  So introverts keep their thoughts to themselves and tend to be thinkers.  Who didn't know this already?  I was also shocked how short it was.  I finished it in two days and asked myself later if maybe I skipped some chapters (I didn't).  I felt the author tapped onto a subject not many others touched onto and jumped at the opportunity to make a quick buck making introverts (who tend to be readers in the first place) feel good about themselves.  Seriously, who didn't know some of the greats she mentioned (i.e. Darwin, Einstein) were introverts?  How else would they have found the time to think out their great discoveries?
B000ICL3CE|5.0|This is my first Cure album, and I will be buying many more. There was always something special about this band that caught my attention, and this is one of the few of many CDs I own where I replayed it after the initial first spin. Great music

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game to pass the time, the Times could be lesser on cleaning the stables or to earn money so it keeps the person's interest though
B000001C6M|3.0|Slayer, or as others call it SLAYYYEEERRRRR!!! however you say their name, they are a force of metal to be reckoned with. On Show No Mercy we see a small glimpse of what is to come. We have a NWOBHM influence with a punkish vibe thanks to Mr. Lombardo on drums. Punk and NWOBHM is what made thrash such an influential genre. Released in 1983 along with the likes of Kill Em All by Metallica and Heavy Metal Maniac by Canada's Exciter these guys helped pave the thrash blueprint to great albums. While not as heavy or fast as Hell Awaits or Reign In Blood, Show No Mercy is a great debut album, not the best, but still great. Tom's vocals range from growls to high pitched screams. Jeff and Kerry make some interesting riffs and leads (when don't they?) and Lombardo, one of the best guys you can have on a drum kit...(better than *cough* Lars)<br /><br />Overall, this debut may be a little dated, but if you're a thrash fanatic that isn't a problem. (This review is for people who aren't familiar with the band either) so chances are thrash fanatics have this. This album, as good as a debut as it may be, doesn't come close to the legacy this band would later achieve. Might not be a five star album but its really close to a four star.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm an artistic person and I was drawn to the possibilities of creating a village with lots of imagination and not just nilly-Willy. The only things that I wish were different are: the fact that every time you touch the blank spaces, it wants to sell it to you. Also every time gets more expensive and it is a little rigid. I would like more freedom, as in the shape/color of things. All in all, it's a wonderful, very addictive (and expensive) game.
B000YHE9J2|3.0|Was told to watch by co-workers. Good movie- entertaining at most.Beats re-runs and late night TV. Not sure why I overlooked the film 13 years ago
B00CMEQD30|1.0|I had a hard time following the strange and unnecesary twists and turns of this novel. An interesting theme was streched beyond capacity until it made a painful read.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|it suck it changes alot of things i dont like it it changes your youtube i to destroy who made it
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I love every season of Dexter, but this one, for me, was really on the mark as we head to a finale.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I get that this is a free game but after level 20 or so you have to pay .99 cents after every 7 levels or so you can continue playing additional levels.. Also, don't sign into facebook using this game because if you do you can't sign out unless you want to lose your progress and all of your purchased content, even if you were halfway through the game before ever signing into Facebook.
B008JFURII|1.0|I enjoyed the first Red.  It was okay- not good, just okay. Considering the amount of talent in that movie, it should have been much better.  That is why I had such high hopes for the sequel.  I had hoped the cast might have developed some more chemistry.  Unfortunately, this is a flat out BOMB!  P.U.!  It is worse than Hudson Hawk.<br />The script is a confused mess.  The movie jumps from scene to scene with no explanation and no transitions, leaving the viewer wondering why everyone is shooting at one another. The plot is D.O.A.  The acting is really sub-par, especially that of Mary-Louise Parker.  Her performance is bad enough to end whatever career she  had. Atrocious.  The movie tries to be a comedy at times, but completely misses the mark.  It ends up exactly like an overstuffed deli sandwich- all ham and cheese.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|I've lost generations of photos but now, thanks to Amazon Cloud Drive Photos, it will never happen again. Thanks Amazon!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I have only one complaint.  The movie is a little sappy.  However, I do not see how anyone can not like this movie.  I cannot see how it did not win a single academy award.  Try to name a movie that everyone likes.  One that you can show to a friend and be confident they will like?  This is it.  It is clever, touching, moving, exciting, and wonderful.  If you have been living in a cave and have not seen it, do so post haste.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the history in this series!!!  The sets & costumes are just wonderful too!!!<br />I would not hesitate to buy and watch this series.
0785163182|2.0|Just senseless fighting among the superheroes of Marvel. I can see this being made into a big budget movie and those that do not know the characters will like it. For those comics fan, it will show nothing of the depth of their favorite super heroes.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I have absolutely no complaints.  This app is very easy to use and has all of the functions I need all rolled up in this one app.  I am pleased with all it offers.  Love it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I used to have the DS version. This is so much better. Very life like and tons to do! I highly recommend.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|There isn't any new historical evidence uncovered - just thoughts and ideas based on the author's interpretation. I am giving this a ,low review since I didn't like the way some information was left out or skewed in the way of the author's theme. For example, he points out that Jesus HAD BROTHERS despite what the Catholic Church says. That's not true. The Catholic Church only says that Jesus was born by Mary who was a virgin. The author fails to point out that historical evidence on a tombstone indicates that James was the brother of Jesus AND son of Joseph.  Sadly the author fails to mention this based on a finding in 2002. If you read the inscription, it never says that Mary was the mother of James. It only says that Joseph was the father of James. (see [...])  Also I find it unbalanced since the author never really goes down deep into the scripture and interprets it. For example, let's take the gospel of Luke as a whole. In the gospel, many of the miracles and interactions are with women and children (who were considered second class citizens.) If someone were to makeup a religion, why would they choose to use these people as their characters?  Overall there isn't anything really new I found in it. If you are Christian or Catholic it's good to read it just to keep up with debunkers such as the author.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Too many false claims. Very one sided and inaccurately describes the actual fracking process. But whatever the media needs to do to get people worked up.
0425166805|5.0|THIS IS ONE AWESOME BOOK FOR PEOPLE INTERESTED IN MYSTERIES OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND THINGS THAT HAPPENED YEARS AGO AS FAR AS MYSTERIES GO.
B0014BC3C2|5.0|This film is a realistic portrayal of how the U.S. government outsources it's torture bosses rather than doing the dirty work itself and to keep the American public in the dark.  A sober look, or reminder, of our dysfunctional world and a hero who comes to the rescue as best any cog in the system can.
140006922X|1.0|Don't bother reading this book written by a devout Muslim who is anti (against)Christ. He follows a self professed child rapist named Mohammed who continues in his attempt to take the glory from God. I am so concerned with the media and all who continue to push this garbage...God have mercy on their souls.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Characters could have been developed a little better. I liked the Bared to You series better.  The characters were more realistic.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|There are plenty of well written reviews on here with more detail, but if you're like me and love to read books with great business (and personal) insights, get this book.
1781162646|5.0|A coming-of-age book sounds too bland for this wonderful, heartwarming story of a gentle giant of a young man.  Given that it is written by Stephen King, Joyland is, of course, accessorized with a haunting background and a heinous villain.<br /><br />What is special about this book, along with a select handful of King's other novels, is his acute perception of human nature: he \\"gets\\" the mindset of his characters before, during and after their experience unfolds.  It not only refreshes your view of the human spirit, but brings you back to that very time when you were experiencing these very same emotions.  I think they call that \\"bittersweet\\".<br /><br />Excellent stuff! It would be a shame if you don't get around to reading it.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|That's the only thing good I can say about the movie.  And, maybe that's not really fair as...I only made it through about 30 minutes.  Maybe I wasn't in the mood to watch a movie that amounts to a video version of the game &#34;Concentration&#34;.  You really have to pay attention, you really have to want it...Crazy makeup, weird accents and a tiresome plot line (tiresome...I'm being generous here).  Just didn't do it for me.
B005544TRQ|5.0|great characters, fast moving. wonderful writers. can't wait to watch season 2. one of the best legal tv series. almost as goo as &#34;The Good Wife&#34;

140006922X|1.0|I believe in one God, the Father almighty. Maker of Heaven and Earth. And in His only Son, Jesus the Christ. Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day he rose from the dead. He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. He shall come again to judge the living and the dead and His kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I read this one around Halloween as I usually read a book like this around that time of year. It's a great classic book to read anytime of year though.

0439023491|5.0|This is the sequel to The Hunger Games. This series is one of the best.<br />The book came as advertised. I was in great condition and on time.
1616551607|5.0|The last time a similar set was released was a couple of years ago.  Granted, the previous set was a limited edition box set, but the content is very similar.  For those unfamiliar with Yoshitaka Amamo, shame on you!  All joking aside, the man is incredibly talented, and his art has inspired many video games, manga, and anime series.  He was the main concept art creator for most every Final Fantasy up to 10.  Tetsuya Nomura usually had the final design job for most of the newer Final Fantasy games.<br /><br />This collection contains three very large, and very well constructed texts with hundreds of pages of beautiful art from the first ten Final Fantasy games.  Each volume covers a few of the games.  When I first opened this collection I was amazed at the weight.  This set is seriously 5 pounds at least!  I know the shipping weight says 2 pounds, but there is no way that it is less than 5.  Here are a few notes I think folks will find interesting:<br />* Fabric enclosed slip case (high quality) bearing Amano-san's art.<br />* Three high quality, very large format books with durable binding.<br />* Nearly 600 pages of amazing art from Yoshitaka Amano<br />* A variety of art mediums including charcoal, pencil, pen, watercolor, and more!<br />* Format according to game, not style, so there is variety from page to page.<br />* Highly collectible and sought after - this WILL go up in price once the initial printings are out of stock<br />* Cheaper here than the $89.99 MSRP (Currently $53.99)<br />* Amazing shipping from Amazon, the slipcase was inside a plastic wrap inside a form fitting box inside an Amazon box with bubble padding.  No damage at all to the slipcase or the books!<br />* A must have for any Yoshitaka Amano fan!<br /><br />I highly recommend this collection.  From one art lover and game design book collector to another - buy it!  You won't be disappointed!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I enjoyed this because it was always wonderful and magical. And because of this book I'm going to see the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put this book down, WOW I can't wait for Sylvia Day to continue the story of eve and gideon.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|This book has real value for everyone. The title speaks for itself, and the information is logically and coherently presented.<br />It's not common to find a book of this type to be so well-written and easy to read. Great for reference material, too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My Grandsons really like the game. But find it easier that their computer version. Would also like to have multiple people be able to play at different times.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|This movie is a magical fun film full of romance lust desire and jealousy. If your into musicals you will without a doubt love this movie.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I love this so much that I bought four. hahaha<br />That's true. Everybody in my list will get this for Christmas.<br /><br />It's happy, funny and you feel like you're watching the show again and again.<br /><br />Absolutely loved!
0062255657|5.0|I like books, I like authors, I often give five star reviews because I enjoy most stories, but if it were possible I would give this novel a ten star review. Five just do not do it justice. Neil Gaiman spins a tale that kept me up reading all night. A beautiful story that I could not leave. There is much truth about childhood, adulthood, the nature of reality, and the honesty of myth in this wonderful book. There are heroes and monsters,and furry kittens that steal your heart.<br /><br />I suggest you get this book as soon as you can and set aside the time to read it,because you won't want to leave it. I most highly recommend this mesmerizing novel. The only bad thing about it is that it ends...
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Love this game. Full of fun. And you can't put it down. They'll be hooked to. Try it and see why.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|I hate chick flicks. Seriously. I take more pride out of the fact that my first blu ray purchase was Rambo. A girlfriend of mine forced me to sit through this the first time by withholding popcorn and kettle chips. Smart girl.<br />I've watched this several times since, by choice, on my own. It's just an honestly funny movie about dating and relationships. It spans all through first dates to marriage, from hot, artsy chicks to girls next door, suave guys to pricks. There are sketches during random parts of the film of impromptu moments of regular people (and famous people) commenting on a particular theme- &#34;when she won't sleep with you...&#34; and things like that. Genius. It's a great way to make the film even more tangible on a realistic level.<br />I'm not the biggest fan of some of the actors in this, but the writing and directing of this far surpass any issues I have with actors. So even if you hate the color pink, or refuse to drop your metallica collection from your ipod, just take a night and watch this, even if it's in private. If you've ever had even the mildest bump in a relationship, you'll find something to enjoy in this movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This story gives one idea of what could have happened if Kennedy had lived. I really enjoyed the story, and the overall message. Great job Mr. King!

B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as good as most John Grisham books. However it is pretty entertaining enough twits to keep you going to the end.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like the other books by this author this one is simply wonderful.  It has far less violence than the other two but, nonetheless, it tells a very tender story in a country split by strife.
B000002IP1|5.0|Phil Collins is one of the top singer, songwriter and musicians of all time.  He tunes stand the test of time.  This album has get singles that are still played today on the radio.  A must for all. Hard copy CD and MP3 versions.
B004GYY714|4.0|It's cool because you can access stations all over the world. It also has some live programs news, sports, talk etc.
B0060MYM3S|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed season one and looked forward to my purchase of season 2.  Well, in season 2 the women take over.  The season is focused on women and the lead men seem to get very little screen time.  They even introduced a 6' 6\\" tall female warrior who kicks male butt.  Sorry, but all these women leaders and warriors offends my sense of reality.  I realize the show is a fantasy and anything goes but season two exceeded my ability to stretch my credibility.  And in any case I, a male, don't relate to queens and female warriors and the show simply became boring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|lol the best game ever. I love it. me and my brother.play it when we cant go outside it is awesome. I like the minion Paul. I wish you could run with him

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it, makes time go fast when out traveling :). Also when your waiting for doctors disappointments or anything that's going to tame time.
B004NS710C|5.0|This is a thrilling movie from start to finish. If I didn't know it was a true story, I wouldn't believe it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Best purchase i have made yet! Way better than season one and I'm definately \\"Hooked\\" on this series! Worth your time and money
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Why on earth would this Google product not work with one of, if not their most popular laptop? I see it says support for the chromebook &#34;coming soon&#34; That's bogus! I bought it specifically to stream from my Chromebook! And I still haven't received any sort of code for 3 free months of Netflix, even though I ordered the first day, right after it was announced.

B007NESBK2|5.0|This is the best concert I have ever been to & the dvd does not disappoint. Fantastic singer, fantastic show.
006178480X|3.0|This is not one of Rollins' best novels but it's probably his silliest.  In his previous works, most of the pseudoscience has centred on biological phenomena.  Given that Rollins was trained as a veterinarian, he was on somewhat familiar ground.  In the present work, he takes on the challenges of general relativity and quantum field theory and is clearly quite lost.  While the concepts he invokes, curved spacetime, quantum entanglement, dark energy and multiple universes are genuine, he combines them in a distinctly childish manner.<br /><br />Much of the action is also rather silly.  DARPA's imaginary Sigma Force has three herculean tasks before them: rescue the commander's girl friend from a North Korean prison, recover the remains of a crashed satellite to prevent the technology from falling into enemy hands and save the world from a disaster of biblical proportions that is predicted to occur only ninety hours from the start of the novel.  Naturally, the commander makes the logical decision and goes after the girl, temporarily leaving the mundane task of saving humanity to his subordinates.  The conclusion is easily predictable and blunted by the addition of an alternate d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />Nevertheless, in the right mood, you will chuckle over the pseudoscience and find enough mayhem to keep you entertained during a summer afternoon.
B007VTVGFQ|4.0|Star added out of shameless personal bias.  I think I like this album because I like Fiona.  Not the person, because I've never met her, but her image, her style, the mood cast by her smoky vocals and off-kilter rhythms.  \\"Fiona.\\"  In all honesty, this album is a little bit of a letdown, with Apple's lyrical power somehow abated, her risky music somehow tamed (both are still uniquely her, but her without that edge and excitement that made me fall in love with her through following the course of her original 3 albums).  She's the one getting 4 stars here, not the album.<br /><br />The album, Idler Wheel, I'd recommend to the Fiona diehard like myself, without hesitation, but to everyone else I'd point to any of her earlier 3 albums as the best collections of music (among her opus, and among vocal music generally - I really love Fiona).<br /><br />The Collector's Edition, which I was sure to order as an avid Fiona Fan, is well-designed and well-executed.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|Being a PPW book, I was expecting something incredible. I was surprised that the writing was less than eloquent and the story lines were not well connected.  I do not recommend this book.
0547564651|1.0|This book was not only unhelpful, but also very boring! It needs a new title because the author does not tell you about \\"how children succeed,\\" so don't buy this book expecting to learn how to go about raising your children so that they will succeed. The author does not provide any practical advice. After providing mind-numbing details about various past events and research studies, he doesn't make any ground-breaking explicit conclusions. He writes like a journalist, making readers draw their own conclusions. Every chapter was like a newspaper clipping, and they were strung together and served to readers as a compilation of all things related to education.<br /><br />This should be no surprise. Does the author have any qualifications to write about how children succeed? He doesn't work with kids nor in the field of education or child psychology. He's not a scientist, doctor, or an experienced parent. His only child was still cooing and in diapers when he wrote this book. He doesn't have any advanced degrees, not even a college degree. He was college drop-out like many of the kids he wrote about.
1426308469|5.0|This book is informative and beautifully illustrated.  It features many dinosaurs, all with neat little bits of information that can be easily digested by youngsters.  It's our 4-year-old grandson's absolute favorite book right now.  The best feature is that it entertains adults almost as much as kids.  Buy it!

B0012TWRAO|5.0|Bought this so that I could attach my Ram mount on my motorcycle. Its strong and very durable. I've been using my ram mount for over a year now and the base has not moved at all. it screws down securely.  It comes with a plastic bit you can add to the back so that the metal doesn't touch the frame, but I left that out since it adds bulk.<br /><br />This mount is right on my handlebars and doesn't get in the way. I also have a ram mount on my bicycle and that too has not moved.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|I love this version of Austen's classic. The actors are amazing and the movie simply strikes the right chord for those of us who love this story.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|We are a Star Trek family. We truly enjoy all things Star Trek but when stories started to sway from the original theme probably really started with the series Star Trek: Enterprise. Stories of an alternate beginning with a \\"time war\\" and an attack on Earth that never happened prior in any Star Trek movie or series. Then when the new Star Trek movie came out and Romulans' get thrown back in time and obliterate the planet Vulcan, this totally changes the scope of stories to come. So this movie goes on from this \\"alternate time line or reality; take your pick\\". Yes this was a story done in the original Star Trek series and then in Star Trek: The wrath of Khan. But keeping that we've skewed from what was to what now is; this story does a great job of being told. And truly some terrific humor and character relationship building.<br /><br /> In the original Star Trek, Kirk and Spock come to be brothers, always looking out for each other and this is carried on in this new movie even stronger. And when it comes to action, it may seem a little slow at times but when it does happen, you're not disappointed. The Dreadnaught class of ship was never built in the original series but in this departure from the old to the new, we get to finally see a Dreadnaught ( a British term for a super battleship prior to the outbreak of WWI ) built and in action, which could lend to even more exciting battles to come with the Klingon empire and the Federation in any future stories. This movie builds on the relationship that many old Star Trek fans kept saying existed between Spock and Uhura. Though it is about time they put seat belts on the ships of the federation, they need to put in the walls. Far too many people keep getting sucked out into space even in this movie. Crew safety was paramount in the concept of the series. But again, this movie delivers a good story and action.<br /><br />We purchased this from our local Best Buy store 9/10/13 and have watched it half a dozen times so far! Though my Daughter and I did not like how Paramount started this new venture, it has gotten our family captivated. In the extra features though, this time the outtakes ( bloopers ) were not included! Total bummer because it is enjoyable to watch the cast members having fun even when they make mistakes. We wish they would include outtakes with every movie. These actors & actresses truly create an enjoyable movie experience! They do a fantastic job of bringing back Star Trek for the new generation and those of us who were used to the older Star Trek with Shatner & company, once we look past the what was, can enjoy this alternate universe of the Federation and a new spin on stories yet to unfold.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next Star Trek movie! Come on Paramount get it in gear!!!!ter and I did not like how Paramount started this new venture, it has gotten our family captivated.

B00BOXZAG6|2.0|I saw the previews and avoided the theaters for this one. The concept looked great and I was very much looking forward to watching this one at home. The concept is new and works. But the large looming figure is that the story is so rushed that many things are left out or are so unbelieveable due to lack of explaination or planning.The end is the WORST ending I have quite literally ever seen in a film. Now on to the 3D aspect of the film. With so many animated parts and potential for screen pops this movie is flat. I was able to take off my glasses for the majority of the movie and not be bothered by the ghosting because simply there was almost none. Oh what could have been.....was not. Rent this in 2D just to say you saw it and call it a day.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Many had bad comments about it but all I can keep saying is its the best movie in a long time.
1567319920|2.0|seemingly in an attempt to make spiritual concepts that are often connected to meditation more available to those unfamiliar with them, the author gets a bit caught up in trying to explain the unexplainable in simplistic terms. this makes for a misleading manifesto for the uninitiated and, at best, a boring read for the advanced student.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy playing this as much as my 8year old and my 2 year old do. We are all learning together.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a very good read for teens. It deals with a very difficult topic and is about empowerment. I did NOT see the revelations made at the end. I actually cried for them all. I probably could have done without the level of intimacy between an 18 & 17 year old still in high school. While sex may be healing as adults, I was not comfortable that it was used for such young hurting kids at the end. Overall a good read but I will have trouble recommending this to younger tweens because of how the sex was used, even if it was between two dedicated kids.
0439023513|5.0|I rarely rave over books anymore but these characters are engaging and I could hardly wait to get from one book to the other as I have read the whole series.  Sadly, this kind of behavior from &#34;the human animal&#34; is too believable which is probably what makes the book so hard to put down.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I have not seen, nor do I desire to see, any Twilight movie! Now that is out of the way; I thought the movie was pretty good. I love anything and everything sci-fi! If you are a Science Fiction fan who doesn't mind a small amount of mushiness, you will like this movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is fun but doesn't connect with users that aren't the kindle version. Other than that I enjoy this game. A must play!
B004IM14RY|5.0|Gripping, nail biting movie that keeps you on the edge until the very end....  Just when you think things are bad, they get worse, just when you are given a little hope; It is buried.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I unequivocally and truly believe this is the greatest book I will ever read in my lifetime. I have read it three times and every other sentence makes me laugh or makes me say \\"God Heller is amazing.\\"  Heller's wit, genius dialogue, and masterful writing truly inspire me. This book is funnier than the best comedy you've seen in theaters.  I cannot give it enough praise. Please read, appreciate, and love this book!
B005HEFB6M|4.0|The theme music is not in line with the epic quality of Star Trek stories. I also felt that the acting of the chief engineer is pretty weak. The other series are difficult to live up to and this one just never quite made it. But it is, after all, Star Trek.
0345803493|4.0|The story is good.  Would have been just as good without the use of language every other breath.  In fact, I got to where I was skimming over much of the language and detail descriptions to find out what happened.  Sometimes things are better left to the imagination.  Read all three, but doing one review to cover all.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|the hail fire would be great but it jams alot if the clips are not in line with the barrel
B00AAS6862|5.0|saw a glimpse on an airplane and was interrupted so many times, so I had to download on my kindle fire and got to watch in peace and in full, clever story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|But is it g o ing to ever have the other part like &quot;the macho lair&quot; because for other devices like android and ios its available but not for kinddle.... thats my only objection about it because the gane is awesome
B00466HN72|5.0|This move is just plain funny.  The voice characters are perfect and it really keeps you entertained. My son loved it!
B002M9WW30|4.0|A collection worth keeping.<br />It shows the scenes of different era - training, lifestyle, from rag to riches and then to rag.<br />Takeaway from these movies - there is no substitution to hard training in sports and intelligent in reading the strengths and weaknesses of opponents.
1603429999|5.0|We all can improve on our skills.  This book does just that.  Little tips to improve my skills.  Just getting into the book, but already can see I will use it more.
B00BD62X14|4.0|This CD is very uplifting. It'll put you in a happy, carefree mood. I don't know the French language at all, but I still enjoy this fun CD.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The book is even better than the show. Great read. I definitely recommend this book. I can't get enough of the pretty little liars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and I'm looking forward to season 4.  Very interesting to see how those people lived and the way things started changing with the times.
0345803485|1.0|Absolute impersonal book. I`m wondering how can the fantasies of a dissatisfied woman could bring her millions of dollars. Obviously, we - the buyers are naïve. All this is unrealistic and misleading to people who have not tasted the pleasure of good sex. Come on, some 21 old years virgin, enjoying sado-maso sex just like that... It takes time and experience. I hope that this so called writer will stop until is too late for her to become funny.
B008476HBM|5.0|Had read Sense and Sensibility, as Austen is one of my father's, YES, father's, favorite authors.  Must admit I saw the movie version of this one first, but decided the book must have a bit more detail than the film.  It does, and is well worth the time!
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|I don't get the low reviews on this, people complaining about the story and the acting...? I saw the first one, so my expectations for this were low. I went into this expecting to see over-the-top action, corny lines, and explosions. The movie delivered. If you want deep storyline and meaningful conversations, then you should go see another flick. If you want to see people get blown up, then watch this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very interesting game.I've only played for maybe 30 minutes and its been great.sounds like I'll be going for the add free version!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is about puzzling out a solution and moving through a space.  It seems a combination of the memory card game of finding and turning pairs of card and critical decision making with a dose of problem solving.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this app soooooooooo much! my brother got me hooked on to it and now I play it twenty four seven.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|While I'm writing this I'm listening the music of this double CD product.<br />Impressive.<br />Even the pictures album!!!<br />The only &#34;negative&#34; can't download Z App on my PC.
B009WUBERW|1.0|I love action movies and expect them to be a bit absurd and clunky. I don't watch them for well plotted scripts and brilliant, well delivered  dialog but this movie didn't even live up to my very low expectations of it.  I enjoyed the first one and would watch it again but this is going on my never again list. Bad, very bad. The only good thing I can say about this film is they don't persue the obvious romance angle between the young woman and Stallone. Thank you Hollywood I did not need to see that kiss. Barf.
B004IYISSK|5.0|Couldn't have been more engrossing. Every mother and daughter will relate to some aspect of the relationships in this book. Each vignette is written gracefully.
B0064NTZKI|3.0|Woody Allen is creature of lucky breaks,fulfilling all his childhood dreams:what he wanted to be he became, comedian, actor,movie director.The calor gas of his his early talent was comedy sketches.We see him using the same Olympia typewriter to write his ideas for films on he used as a 16 year old writing comic one-liners.He does cut and paste on his writing using staples(no computers for him).A creature of habit,he also plays jazz on clarinet every Monday night.The films of his that show how the writer of comedy sketches tacked together turned into the full-blown cineaste are Manhattan,Annie Hall,Stardust Memories,Hannah and Her Sisters,Crimes and Misdemeanours, Husbands and Wives.In these films he explored the inner life of his characters.After the Farrow-Soon-Yi saga,the elephant in the room,his films seem to diminish in quality,where he flies back to comedy.His career never recovered<br />possibly due to a karmic breakdown.There is a parallel universe in Allen's world.He would like to play down,shy away from this what may have been catastrophe in his personal life.It seems his escape into fantasy selves is pulverised by the enormous shock of reality.It is true Farrow was his muse for 10 years(1982-1992),just has Keaton had been earlier and Johannson was to be later,that they never married and lived in separate apartments,they adopted 2 children and had one child,that Soon-Yi was not adopted by him and never regarded him as a fatherfigure, was 21 when they had the affair;but it is hard to go over the accusation of child abuse.You notice too in his later films he usually is not in them(as the comic,nerd) but gets younger actors to play the parts.Witness hislate great successful film Midnight in Paris.Allen has simply denied the effect of becoming world famous for a scandal, his bland exterior has become internalised.He's likeable,amusing,self-deprecating,humble,remained both productive and married to Soon-Yi,and he is obviously dependent upon her.Their marriage has lasted.Should we give Allen a break and see what happens?Is he great once reality sets in?I must say I liked this film even though it skirts a difficult area. I love Woody Allen as a film maker,this documentary is good for what it shows of great scenes from his films,the visit to childhood haunts,and the people like managers, who saw his great potential and stuck with him.He's like the Casanova of film auteurs applying the quantity theory of creativity to a large body of work,a few duffers,some really good ones,the angel's share went to the gods.
B001GA1RFA|2.0|It was good at some parts but a little slow at some others. It wasn't as good as the fault in our stars or looking for Alaska but it was pretty good because I really like John green and what he writes.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|There are many reasons why I love this book. However my favorite  thing about this book is that, more than any other book that I have read in a while, it successfully articulates race relations in America.
B00BWGL6BS|4.0|For a great easy album, this works for me. She doesn't strain, she doesn't challenge, she just delivers. Great voice, some great lyrics, great choices for arrangement. I like it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Considering the price I probably shouldn't quiibble so much.  Until I got the accuWeather app I had no weather information.  I tried to go to the accuweather site but Android and the default browser chopped the page up so badly it was unusable.  The AccuWeather app gives me everything I really want except for the moving radar weather map.  There is a small (about 1.5&#34; by 1.5&#34; static image of the radar return but when I try to enlarge the image all I get is a blank screen except for some small blocks at the top of the page which should show the image progress and rain amounts (I assume).  All in all an OK app but I will probably keep looking.
B0078ZTWP4|1.0|UNLIKE THE RAYOVAC THIS IS A COPYCAT OF RAYOVAC LANTERN.THE CONNECTORS ON THE BOTTOM SPIN WHEN YOU ATTEMPT TO CLOSE THE CAP FOR THE BATTERIES.THERE WERE NO ALIGNMENT MARKS SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE GROOVES ON THE CAP AND  LIGHT TO LINE IT UP TO CLOSE.THE CONNECTOR PART ON THE CAP THAT SPINS HAS TO BE ON THE BATTERIES BEFORE YOU CAN ATTEMPT TO CLOSE IT.ALSO THE INSTRUCTIONS INDICATE TO TWIST HEAVILY IF NORMAL TWIST DOESN'T WORK.I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE LIKE RAYOVAC IT IS BRIGHT.IT HAS HIGH AND LOW SETTINGS AS WELL AS A STROBE LIGHT. IF YOU DON'T MIND THE EXTRA EFFORT FOR BATTERY INSTALLATION IT'S A GOOD LIGHT.<br /> UPDATE 11-19-2013<br />  LIGHT WOULD NOT COME ON SO I WENT TO CHECK BATTERIES AND THE CONNECTOR CLIP ON CAP HAD BROKE.I WAS UNABLE TO SOLDER DUE TO METAL TYPE SO I HAD TO REMOVE CONNECTOR AND STRIP SOME 16 GAUGE ELECTRICAL WIRE AND WRAP IT AROUND THE BROKEN END OF CONNECTOR THEN PUT THE CONNECTOR BACK INTO THE CAP.THE LIGHT WORKS NOW BUT FOR HOW LONG. I AM NOW REVISING MY REVIEW DOWN TO 1 STAR BECAUSE THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|A must Have . it has some new and some old songs from Aerosmith, plus some bonus materiel. Great price doe what you get
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great series. Buy all 13. Vince Flynn knew more about the threats facing our country than our gov does. Not a &#34;politically correct&#34; book.
1451695195|3.0|I wish that the author wrote more about heaven than about his disease and the reaction of his family while he was in a coma.<br />This book didn't meet my expectations.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|This set is one of the best toys ever. It is very detailed and the robot is quite big. It even comes with Sensei Wu. I must admit the price is a bit higher than expected. Over all it was awesome.
B007MDB71O|5.0|John Carter of Mars is criminally underrated! The marketing strategy was horrible, but the fans are what peeked my interest. Yes, it can be campy at times, but all good sci-fi movies are. Sit down with a group of friends and have a great time watching it. You will not be disappointed.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I got this and I thought it it was great. This is a very good show and I would recommend you to buy this
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|f you don't care too much for content that is exclusively on traditional TV and don't have a massive local library, this device is perfect! The user experience is seamless like what we've come to expect from Apple.<br /><br />I used to have a computer plugged into my TV with a wireless keyboard. This brought an end to that.<br /><br />Price: For $35 and three free months of Netflix (worth $24), it costs about the same as a nice sandwich. With the Roku stick priced at $99 as the closest rival, I didn't even bat an eyelid buying this!<br /><br />Setup: So easy! Plug into a power source and HDMI cable, run one-time the setup app on Android or your computer to hook it up to your home wifi network and it's ready to go.<br /><br />Interoperability: The way this works is your mobile devices or computer talk to Google servers and Google relays the message back to your Chromecast, so your devices are never directly streaming to your Chromecast. I suspect the way Chrome browser mirroring works is that Chrome pushes the DOM up and Google relays it back down to your Chromecast.<br /><br />What all this means is that the device is super easy to use. You can control is from multiple phones as long as they're on the same wifi network with no additional authentication. Starting a stream from one app or device automatically takes over from the last.<br /><br />It also means your phone's isn't killing its battery streaming to your TV. In fact, its likely using less power than it would playing the video on its own screen.<br /><br />Local Content: Chromecast is basically a stripped down version of Chrome running on a dongle connected to your TV. That means all content has to be streamed over a web protocol, so your MKVs are likely to not work.<br /><br />I'm trying to see if I can write an app to reference my local storage in some useful way. The API is here - [...]<br /><br />Simplicity: The lack of feature clutter makes this device amazing! It promises Netflix, YouTube and Chrome tabs from your computer (hint: pretty much everything else) and does it really well!. Another big win over the Roku stick is that there's no extra remote to worry about. You can control this from the apps you know and love.<br /><br />I have a Sonos that I love but this takes it a step further because I don't have to use something like the clunky Sonos app and I can directly use the YouTube or Netflix apps.<br /><br />Video Quality: I was getting 1080p from Netflix over my FiOS connection regularly. It helps that my TV is placed right over my router.<br /><br />Verdict: Shut up and take my money!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I thought the adaptation and acting were exceptional!  If you are a fan of the books, I think you will also enjoy watching this video series.
0517543052|5.0|Be Here Now was my first peek into the world and philosophy of Zen. Since then I have studied - and practiced, and practiced, and practiced until I'm at a place of relative serenity and peace. I bought this copy - I'd managed to give mine away - for my grandson who is off to University this fall. I don't know yet if I will give it to him or not. His world is eons awsy from Zen, but it's always good to have a copy anyway.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was quite enjoyable and very realistic. The competitions are fun to train for and you can even earn prizes! You can buy equipment and new horses as well, and you can also earn them. You need to be careful, though, because it is easy to waste time playing this game!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Had a diffcult time geting thru the book. Read other books at the same time. Liked his other books, but not this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think that this gane is a fun game, although sometimes it freezes up and I get frustrated, it may just be the device, but ive never had that happen to me, so....
B008NA3I30|1.0|This was the biggest waste of time spent watching a movie - it's right up there with Unbreakable with Samuel Jackson.  Don't waste your money or your time.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|National Book Award-winning author Colum McCann  has just published his 8th book.  Let the Great World Spin is his seventh.  A fictional work, it has been called the most cathartic of the post-9/11 works of literature.  McCann uses skillful and powerful prose to create realistic fictional characters whose lives have all been touched by violence and loss, and whose lives link together in surprising ways.  The setting is New York, 1974.  The novel  is set in motion by a real-life New York happening--a tightrope walker who walks between the World Trade Towers.  There's even a haunting photograph, showing the tightrope walker in the foreground, with a plane in the background that appears to be heading right for one of the Tower buildings.  But wait!  This novel is set more than a quarter century before the carnage of 9/11/2001, which is never mentioned, but that underscores the happenings in this plot.  McCann has written a book with memorable fictional characters and realistic dialogue to present ways of dealing with the violence and loss that characterize our times. It is masterful.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app!  It's definitely my new go to app when I'm looking for something fun to do on the go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cant stop playing it! Its fun and easy, my nieces love playing it too,<br />plush the minion himself is really funny.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. My seven year old really enjoyed it.<br />I cannot wait for more levels to be available.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Hard to find these to rent so got these for my 2 little one s. Great condition. Really recommend them.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Good weather and conditions app. Nice radar and you can plug in 4 locations for travel or keeping an eye on hometown.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I am sorry that there are people who get treated  so poor by &#34;the System'.  Life wasn't fair and yet the story wasn't too believable.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|I will start by saying i never buy romantic movies or movies in that genre. But i bought this due to the sci fi nature and amazing visuals. And this movie is astounding in its visual beauty and has a great concept in having two worlds side by side with the couple falling in love and on literal and physical opposite sides of living. Me loving this movie while hating kristen dunst is also a testament to how good this is. The movie is epic and now within my top 10 which includes inception, requiem for a dream, and vanilla sky. Fantastic movie that is even better in 3d if you have a tv that supports it. My only negative about this movie is that they didnt release it in theaters as that would have been a treat.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is awesome! I don't play games very often but this is my favorite.  Plus you can quit whenever you like and resume without any problems.
0062255657|3.0|The story was an interesting concept and the writer was good; but it's not the type of story I usually read.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|Love this movie for the story that will keep you one on the edge of your seat. Great directing and love Eric Stoltz & Ashton Kutcher.<br /> Very good physiological thriller that will unfold a story relating to the chaos theory.<br />Highly recommended.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|The app work ok. But there are a few problems.<br />1) the interface is a bit confusing and the help is not helpful.<br />2) there is on integration with other apps like email or web apps
B003G4W49C|4.0|a pretty good read. had alot of action.  I had for a long time always wanted to read this book so i finally downloaded it to my kindle.  wasn't disapointed.  there's alot of political stuff in it that i thought it could have done without but otherwise a good action sci-fi book.  One thing that makes this story even more interesting is that the main characters are all kids.  while reading i would sometimes forget that i was reading a book about gifted kids and not grown-ups.  i would recomend this book to anyone who wants to read a good book about a miltary hard-knock-life during wartime.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The DVDS came in a really sharp looking case-like box - very impressive. This is one of the very best drama series ever made (a few other very best include &#34;Homicide&#34;, &#34;The Wire&#34;, &#34;Sopranos&#34; & &#34;Friday Night Lights&#34;). One you can watch over and over again. Purchase and enjoy!
B00006JSS8|4.0|Good and sweet deal thanks guys definitely what I was looking for in a cool song I will sure buy again from you guys.Thanks!!!!!
B0035LGXXO|3.0|After watching this movie for the first time just now, it's hard for me to understand the hype.  Perhaps it was a big achievement at the time.  Not sure.  I found the story somewhat boring and predictable.<br /><br />Starts with a massive gathering of gangs in New York (minus the mafia I guess) where the unofficial \\"leader\\" of all things gang related, Cyrus, is trying to convince all the gangs to unite for a common cause, to take over the streets of New York from the cops (good luck with that) and is then shot while giving this inspiring speech.<br /><br />Everyone flees and one member of the Warriors sees the guy from another gang who did the shooting.  The culprit yells out that the warriors shot Cyrus.  The rest of the movie, gangs are chasing the Warriors for killing Cyrus because word on the street is that the Warriors killed Cyrus, yet it takes them a while to figure out why all these gangs are chasing them.  That's it.  I won't \\"ruin\\" the end but there's really not much going on.  Little dialogue and lot's of fight scenes and running from cops and other gangs.  Random ally chicks here and there, and somehow the Warriors pick up one along the way.  Odd.  She's really good looking and good at running with those high heels too!<br /><br />Call me crazy, but if I figured out that everyone in town thinks my group shot \\"Cyrus\\" and that's why we keep getting chased and attacked by people we don't know when all we're doing is trying to go home and sleep... i'd probably take off those clothes we're wearing that make us look like a gang called \\"the warriors.\\"  Guess they prefer battle scars, running and/or the thrill of people trying to kill them.  I suppose it might be difficult to find shirts in the middle of the night...<br /><br />Some of the shots (cinematography) are cool and I guess people like the fight scenes.
B00DU74U74|1.0|Really poor take on a very good book. Perhaps the target is 12 year old girls. Total waste of money.  I would give it zero stars if that was an option.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|awesome movie, looks even better in 3-d. wish it came with a vudu copy or digital copy. worth every penny
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|It's just great work. A incredible work of art which sounds even better than the original!!! Somehow they have maintained the escence of the original recordings improving the sound. In my opinion this doesn't happen with all remixes. This is one of the rare times when I feel that i got miuch more for my money than I expected.
B000002PCS|5.0|I purchased this product years ago on cassette tape when the mini series came to television.  Somewhere along time, I misplaced the tape. I have wanted a CD for years but just never got around to purchasing.  So, I finally did purchase it.  I love it just as much now as I did back then.<br /><br />It has that lovely, ethereal, romantic feel that I love about some classical music.  It is music to which I can relax at the end of the day, or any time of the day.  Love, love, love it!!!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|i have been hooked on the Vorkosigan series from &#34;Shards of Honor&#34; in which Miles' parents first met, all the way to &#34;Cryoburn&#34;, when Miles is married and a father himself.  Any time I have a shot at more of Bujold's complex, serious, yet humorous group of characters, I grab it.  It was nice to finally have Ivan featured as more than the sidekick in this novel.
B007OWRBJK|1.0|Pete Townshend comes across as a selfish, ignorant man, and he wrote the book himself!  I felt very sorry for his long suffering wife and children. I was hoping he would be interesting and have some capability of higher thought.  Even the cover picture conveys his high opinion of himself.
0736092269|5.0|If you workout with weights this is a must !!! A great buy.  This is a book you keep forever.

B009WO7NQO|2.0|I can't minimize the screen. Hard to see where the target is. There is no tournament to play. That sucks.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Found the game difficult to use, after finding the first item it seemed not to work. So I deleted it from my device
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a true story, very good movie. I would recommend it to anyone that is an animal lover like myself. Great experience from factory to me. Customer service is awesome and will order from you in the future. Thank you.
B00CXN2JNS|5.0|Like most of their new stuff, it took a few listens for me to get into Supercollider, but I'm a fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's awesome and I wish temple run and other running games like this. With the easy way to move from left to right . It's just freaking awesome
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, the book was excellent reading.  Mitch Rapp was an interesting character and will be sorely missed by all his many fans.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I gave this 2 stars because I did finish it. But it was more in the way people stare at a train wreck because they can't look away. By the time I reached the midpoint of this book, I loathed both of these people. I didn't want to be in a world where people like this exist. The only saving grace I could think of was that at least they were with each other, and thus saving two other innocent people from being with either of them.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|It is a very good game.  It is calming to go back and forth between collecting the coins and algae.  It does want you to spend money which is a big downfall.
B0030DBGXY|5.0|I've purchased several of the standard SRKs over time. They make GREAT gifts and super belt knives. I put off buying the San Mai version because the standard was so great! Now that I have one I wish I had more. Amazing knife! So simple and so right! The kydex sheath is perfect.<br />The only two things I would add to this knife as options is the blackened blade feature on the standard and and inch of serrations. I would be more than willing to send it back and have these done if it was possible.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books and will buy any new book he comes out with. Heard interview on npr...he's a doctor too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am a 40 something mom who was looking for a break from my current addiction to \\"Hunger Games-esque\\" type books. In the last two years, almost ( except Game of Thrones) everything I've read has been in the young adult fiction genre....seems like this is where the real writing and storylines are these days... this is a quick read, beautifully written. I fell in love with all of the characters very quickly. I never give spoilers, and dislike reviews that give deep synopsis' ... with that said, if you are looking for a beautiful story with a realistic ending, this book is for you. Plan on shedding a few tears, laughing at times and being angry too...it's all here!
B001EYK54W|2.0|More time capsule than time warp. &#34;The Thomas Crown Affair&#34; brought back my hometown of Boston frozen in amber in 1968: no skyscrapers, no Quincy Market, no tourists, no waterfront, no nada. We of course loved it that way, knowing no better. Likewise Faye Dunaway's wardrobe - pure &#34;Mad Men meets the Jet Age&#34; and complete with hats, lots of hats - is something you never saw in Boston then nor are very likely to see today. High-style we ain't, even now that we're rich and trendy. Same way with the beach house Steve McQueen was building on the dunes in Truro - I doubt they're still giving out building permits on fragile wetlands in a National Seashore, but hey, what the hell- it was a window into my past.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the pacing of the movie made me feel like it took from then until now to tell. The story - a crime caper overlaid with a romance between the mastermind and the insurance investigator - moves along with all the speed of an elderly tortoise on quaaludes. That and the really annoying multi-screen effects which no one but Hitchcock could do then and few can do as well now made the movie a non-starter, or rather, &#34;non-ender&#34; for me: it was so slow I couldn't watch the last twenty minutes. I have a life and things to do, and being bored to tears about a story I don't care about isn't one of them, no matter how nostalgic I might be about the days when Shreve's was on the corner of Arlington and Boylston or how you could pull up to the Ritz and park out front on what was then a two-way Newbury Street or have dinner at Joseph's, a restaurant which went out of business decades ago.<br /><br />McQueen isn't that believable as a rich businessman, Dunaway was gorgeous: just watching her (rotary) dial the phone was so erotic, and they did trouble themselves to hire minor players with Boston accents, but it was pretty thin compared to what it might have been, then or now.<br /><br />Two stars tops, and the second one's because I remember it all and it was nice to see Boston the way it used to be, but that's not much to hang a movie on - not one I want to watch 'til the end, anyway.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I like this story better then Girl Gone, this one had more evil  characters which added mystery. Good summer read.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I love this author's previous works, but this book was not nearly as moving as the others. Also, I found it difficult to keep track of the characters in the latter part of the book.  Even so, if you are a fan, this story is worth reading.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|A well written and thought provoking narrative addressing all of human history and why societies in different parts of the world developed as they did.  However, not having the annotated maps referred to in the text is frustrating.  I expected the e-book to be equivalent to the printed version, but the omission of illustrations is a serious shortcoming.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is a great game it is really fun and its free if i where you i would get it

0449011917|3.0|I've been listening to the audiobooks for A Song of Ice and Fire and the first three books were wonderful as read by Mr. Dotrice!  However, this is the book in which I decided to write a review.  I was disappointed in the audiobook production quality.  Roy Dotrice does a terrific job of reading the book, but he fowls up many of the character voices that had been established since the first book!  Jaime's lost his accent.  Arya sounds like an old woman.  Samwell had sounded perfect to his description, but now sounds like a big idiot (he's a coward, not stupid).  Petyr went from a cunning whisper to sounding like a Baratheon!  Some of the voices slip back into their old sound once in awhile.  Not only did the voices get changed but the pronunciations are inconsistent compared to the first books or even within chapters.  Brienne becomes bree-ann or bri-een at random.  Petyr was once Pet-ire is now the commonly accepted Peter (I like pet-ire better).<br /><br />I know a lot of people are blaming Dotrice for this (he's 90 as I write this) but really this is the fault of his production crew.  Dotrice still uses a wide range of character voices and reads the narrative with his excellent voice.  The production team should have been spot checking his work and making sure it was consistent (with pronunciations) and helping Dotrice to reference his previous voices.  Keep in mind A Feast For Crows came out 5 years after A Storm of Swords so I can't blame Dotrice for forgetting some voices.  It's a real shame because I had fallen in love with the characters to the point where I could tell who was talking based solely on the voice Mr. Dotrice was using.  Consistency should always be maintained in audiobook format and this one falls flat.
B00BSO2U1Y|5.0|I absolutely love this cd..listen to every time i am in the car..true beauty!! absolutely stunning and wonderful cast. ENJOY
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun but short. Light challenges that are more clever than hard but entertaining nonetheless. Definitely worth a play at this price.
B009M588K8|5.0|Plowed thru it in just a few days, couldn't stop thinking about it or talking about it. Pass it on to my Mom who is 87 yrs old and she read it within a few weeks.  Her opinion is the same as mine.  She's keeping the book for a re-read. Highly, highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush. I loved the movie and now I can play a game very simple to the movie. It is such a cute game.<br />:)
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Caveat:  I did not watch this.  My 8 year old wanted this and it did not disappoint him.  He has been begging us to watch it as a family movie night, so I may edit this after i watch it (I won't change the 5 stars, because it wasn't for me).
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Really like this app, easy to use and understand. Used it so we knew what we would need to pack for a trip.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|New condition as stated, haven view yet, however received in unopened new packaging doesn't appear to have been tampered with.  Received quickly.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Reading the death of one of my favorite characters in the series is never easy (no spoilers here) but this book is a good staging point to a climax yet to come.  Can't wait to read about what happens next.  Hope Martin releases the next book soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not too hard. not too easy. takes a little to figure out how to get started.  fun for all ages.
1452126577|5.0|If you are a fan of Tardar Sauce aka Grumpy Cat. This is a fun quirky little book to have. Filled with pictures, games and insight on how to be grumpy. It was just a fun little book, if you are a fan of Grumpy Cat.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|There's a lot of shooting and bad guy stuff in this film--which my kids are not used to seeing--but the conflicted heart of Gru made it worth while. It was his behavior that was bad, not his character. Plus it shows that behavior can change. The end was heartwarming and we all loved it. The film earns 4 stars.<br /><br />The actual Blu-ray was flawed. It kept pausing and not working. Thank goodness it came with a standard DVD as well. I need to contact Amazon about replacing the broken disc.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Simple, well-made and crazy addictive. Oh, and free. I probably put upwards of 30 hours into it in one minute increments across five platforms (Kindle, iPhone, PS Vita, Xbox and Win8).
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This series is ageless and enjoyable every time I watch it.  I don't know why I did not watch it originally.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great escape game. Some games are hard to decipher but this is not too complicated Can't wait for new levels to download
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|the hi-pitched youngish voice coming from the vererable old bent image of our illustrious president belied the character of the man.  HIstory comes to life, sort of.  but its plodding and tedious in the telling.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|With so many reviews already, I'll just add my 4-star vote. As some of the critical reviews accurately point out, there are a few very serious \\"wtf\\" moments where no amount of tortured logic can make the events fit with reality. They were painful, unfortunate, but I was able to block them out and enjoy the fast-paced ride.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is by far Card's best novel.  The ending is eloquent and you do not have to worry what happens next.  You know there is more to their lives and you want to know.  Card makes it satisfying without leaving hysterical absences.  Yet, as an intrigued reader you will crave more story and read everything else he wrote.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received this yesterday.  It took all of 3 minutes to install.  The installation on PC is performed from a downloaded EXE.  Your system WiFi is momentarily disconnected from your local WiFi and connects to the Chromecast dongle.  From there the setup configures the Chromecast to connect to your PC's formally in use WiFi SSID. After setup your PC is returned back to its normal WiFi connection.  The process is amazingly smooth.<br />So far I have \\"cast\\" from a PC notebook, Kindle Fire, IPad, and S3 phone.  Chromecast takes queues from Apple with the in-App \\"cast\\" button.  Multiple Chromecast dongles are supported from the cast button, so you can cast to several TVs or rooms from a single device. Any application that had the cast button works great.  So far Netflix, YouTube, and the Chrome browser have cast buttons.  Netflix works great on this product from every device I tried.  Video playback appears equal to more expensive devices like Xbox or PS3.  My receiver indicated only stereo playback from Netflix and not surround sound.<br />For YouTube the cast button is built into the videos.  Casting a video from the video cast button and not the browser cast button produces finer video playback.  When casting from the browser, the active tab is cast without frame, buttons, or URL address bar.  You will not see the mouse moving around on the Chromecast screen but highlighting text is mirrored to the TV.  Using the ctrl + and ctrl - buttons (to change browser zoom) on my PC also changed the zoom of the browser on the Chromecast.  Silverlight and QuickTime video where hit or miss (mostly miss) but Google has indicated they are not supported.  Because casting stays on the App or browser tab being cast this has great potential for business presentation use.<br />Chromecast is able to display local network content and websites.  Using the Chrome browser I was able to browse local file shares, like my freenas (using the url: file://freenas/) and play local videos in MKV and MP4 but not WMV.  Local video playback was choppy on high bit rates videos (1-2GB) and smoother at lower rates (200-400 mb).  I suspect that Chromecast apps will correct this in the future.  Mp3 audio files played from the browser cast and sounded amazing.<br />Chromecast connected on my 2.4 ghz WiFi.  The WiFi signal strength is displayed on screen prior to casting a source.  WiFi signal strength was on the week side, most likely a limitation of the small form factor and no external antenna.  I added an Asus repeater (RT-N12) to the room and this corrected the signal strength issue.<br />I have read that the dongle can power off of the HDMI port alone but that was not the case with my Pioneer 7.1 Receiver.<br />Overall this product is a no brainer at $35.  This product has huge potential especially as new apps are introduced.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very well done app. Entertaining enough to hold the attention of a 10 year old or 38 year old.  Like it better than other horse apps.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Awesome book. If you think you know the history of the air war in Europe you will be pleasantly surprised to learn something new.  You will recognize many famous German<br />Aces and see a side of them that you never thought existed. Great story of heroism and courage of both the US Army Air Corp and the Luftwaffe.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Just wow, it's all you can say. But as they want me to say more I will say this is a movie all should see.
B005K17RU0|5.0|As an avid RVr who has driven over 160,000 miles in the last five years,  Accuweather is the most efficient tool I have found to remain in touch with upcoming weather.  it works very well on my tablet.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The app updated and the new format is awful to try to figure out the 10 day forecast and go back between screens. Also all the pictures on the home screen make it hard to even read the current forecast. Please bring back the old version or fix this one!!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Im not always the biggest fan of action movies but these guys make the experience just great! Even Captain America who always seemed kind of strange to me. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|After hearing people talk about this book for the better part of a year, I finally decided to give it a read.  For once, a book lived up to the hype.  It is the best book I've read this year.  The characters were unique, multifaceted, and interesting and the story was excellent.  While the ending wasn't what I would have wanted it to be, it was believable and made sense.  Perhaps it was not the best book to read while on my honeymoon, but it kept me highly entertained on the plane ride back from Europe.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|mostly like temple run but minon<br />style and battles and big challenges and easy challenges<br />like buying a cool item.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|When the local weather isn't showing or Dish is interrupted, it's nice to have this app ready and handy to show where the storms are headed.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|this movie is quentins best it had a great storyline and course silly parts like quentin likes it and it was not boring at all jamie and leonardo were great
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Don't know how I missed all this in 2011!  I bought it with some trepidation not knowing what to expect.  I was blown away.  Sierra and Ramin could easily compete with Michael and Sarah in their peak.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wonderful game with no gory. We love the grafics and my children enjoy it. It's a perfect game. Would absolutely recommend it.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|I have installed the free version and it kept saying error force close. So I bought it for 99 cents to see if maybe that would work and nope same thing!!!!! I am very disappointed that this is a big fish game never had a problem before
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|I haven’t bought a Queensryche album since 1997…and the one I bought (Hear in The Now Frontier) I didn’t really like. Everything since Promised Land hasn’t appealed to me at all. I previewed each album hoping to hear the Ryche sound. Never happened. It did this time. This album sounds like the band I got into in 1988. If you like the sound that helped them amass legions of fans (guitar harmonies, soaring vocals with awesome melodies, rock solid rhythm section, etc.), you’ll like this album. If you like the stuff they’ve been doing for the last 15 years or so, you probably won’t. Highly recommended from a long-time fan.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Very cute video, documentary Queen, the songs are magnificent, the comments also. Recommended for all fans of Queen and Fredy Mercury.
B003ITF6H2|1.0|This is the first film I've ever given a one-star rating on here. I always try to find some good in a movie, some redeeming quality that makes me like it, but it felt like no matter what happened in this movie, it just made me angrier and more bored.<br /><br />Let me break it down for you like this: Burt and Vicky, in this film, are a married couple on the brink of utter marital destruction; the character Vicky is the most insufferable shrew one could imagine. Whereas Linda Hamilton's character in the 1984 original was playful, friendly and much more easily able to relate to, this Vicky spends the first 40-45 minutes doing nothing but yelling at her husband, blaming him and insulting him when he didn't even cause a need for her to be upset. Burt is honestly the only character I can relate to in the movie; he's good-natured, patient, strong-willed and is still able to emote like a regular human being (as opposed to his wife who basically does nothing but spew animosity throughout). This isn't a Children of the Corn remake!!! This is \\"How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days: Hee-Haw Edition\\"!!!<br /><br />The evil children in this movie are also very poorly done, especially in comparison to those of the original. The kids in this film aren't very bright and don't do a half-convincing job that they're evil; honestly I just felt like the little suckers needed a good spanking to set them straight. Also, I'm aware that one isn't supposed to like the villain in a horror film, but even as the bad guys, I just wanted to go up to the children and say \\"I don't like you.\\" That's right, even the villains in this horror film aren't on par with a decently-done villain role. The character of Isaac was just an annoying little shrimp, whereas in the original he was twisted and menacing, and FAR more believable. This film's Malachai also has nowhere near as much finesse as Courtney Gains in the original movie; Malachai here just kinda has no personality and is pretty forgettable as far as being the bad guy that does the dirty work.<br /><br />What really bothers me about the film, though, is that despite how insufferable the first 45 minutes or so were, halfway through, this movie has the utter nerve to pick up the pace. I wasn't expecting the film to be very exciting, but about 50 minutes in the kids start to attack, Burt fights back in an attempt to rescue Vicky, and all the creepy cult material kicks into play. It's bad enough that half the film wastes our time on pointless bickering, but to turn itself into an almost-decent excuse for a low-budget made-for-television remake of a horror classic just bothered me. It's the equivalence of hearing a musical artist you don't like do a legitimately good cover of a song you do like.<br /><br />All in all, this was one of the poorest horror movie remakes I've ever seen. The ONLY reason I would suggest that anyone watch it is they, like me, want to complete the Children of the Corn film series. Otherwise, stay FAR away from this garbage. This is just one of those films that shouldn't have been made. In all honesty though, I do think there are some remakes of the 2000's that are legitimately good, such as The Last House on the Left, Maniac and Mother's Day, so give those films a chance before you subject yourself to the torture that is this movie. Thanks for the time, and peace.
B003ELOQD4|5.0|Very cute video, one of the best concerts of the story, the full force of U2 and Bono in this video.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love carrying my favorite 'reads' along with me wherever I have my smart phone.  Great for those moments when you're stuck in a waiting room ~~
006056251X|5.0|Before I get to \\"Devil in Winter\\" I have to say I am terribly biased. I LOVE Lisa Kleypas and will read anything by her, and I mean anything. Traditionally I prefer paranormal and historical romances, versus contemporary, but Kleypas has proven time and time again that no matter what genre she writes under it will have a really good chance at being my next favorite. I found \\"Devil in Winter\\" about two years ago and have probably read it about 150 times.<br /><br />\\"Devil in Winter\\" is the 2nd installment of the \\"Wallflowers\\" series, but it is a great stand-alone and you don't have to read the previous ones to enjoy the book. The story is about Evangeline Jenner, a shy red-headed heiress and Viscount Sebastian St. Vincent, a jaded rake. In an attempt to save herself from her abusive guardians, Evangeline purposes marriage to the equally desperate Sebastian, who agrees. I love how shy Evie blooms into a strong-minded woman who has the womanizer wrapped around her finger. Sebastian is a narcissistic jerk for most of the book. Which of course makes his inevitable fall into monogamy all the sweeter.<br /><br />This is an amazing book and one you have to finish in one sitting. Simply because you can't put it down.<br /><br />Like my review? Check out my romance review blog! [...]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really cool. It's like a Temple Run but the difference is you don't tilt the device you move it with your finger. I definitely recommend it, especially if you have young kids.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The flashbacks keep you wanting more.  The action is a bit over the top, but not much for free runners or those training for American Ninja Warrior.  Good story line to go with the action.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband and I just started watching this show and have blown through three seasons in three weeks! We know we will be sorry when we have to wait for nect season yo come. We highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game works with your brain a lot. It changes obstacles that you have to get through in order to get to the trophy. It also is very entertaining as it keeps you busy for when your bored or just want to have fun :) I recommend this game to anyone whom has seen Despicable Me. As it is based on the movie. Thank you &amp; Enjoy The Game ^&middot;^
0345472322|5.0|This book has been insightful and has brought to light many behavior changes that can really make a difference in anyone's life.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We received and my grandkids wanted to watch it.  So we watched together and they decided they wanted to take home so they could watch it again.  So - I would say it was a &#34;Hit&#34; in our home.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|nothing more needs to be said except that I am extremely pleased with this gaming headset. and that's about that
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|We've been listening to this non stop for weeks now. Ozzy sounds great. The music is really reflective of the Black Sabbath sound as it has changed over the years. Great stuff!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loooooooooooove this games I thank it's way better than temple run and subway surfers I mean it has minions who doesn't love minions a
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good way to play magic solo, anywhere you go. Good gameplay, good soundtrack, animations are cool. Sealed deck play is nice, challenges cool, campaign cool. The only way it would be better is if it were free.  Or if they made an android version of MTGO.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love it!!!!! One of the best books I've read! Excited about the next one!!!! Can't wait to see how it ends!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very good game. I enyoyed the challenge and had much fun playing it with my granddaughter. Loved it so much!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Sorry if my grammar is bad but this game is the best . You should buy it now it is also cheaper than the computer version  but not as good.

B00AYB1RXE|5.0|What an amazing story, just one-of-a-kind.  A man who sold half a million records in a faraway country in the 70's, and was not even aware of it, no royalties, no news of it at all, is found more than 20 years later by a South African man who was tenacious in his search even though he thought this legendary figure had died.<br /><br />A true story that is stranger than fiction.<br />I'm glad I purchased this video, and I hope more people will view it!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is simply the best of the various adaptations of this Jane Austen novel. The leads are sympathetic and wellacted. The supporting cast is also perfectly cast. The screenplay is faithful to the book.
B004FN1T3A|3.0|I'm a doula, and read this to help prepare for a client's birth. Although I think most of the techniques are tremendously helpful if you practice and work on them, it really requires the whole team be invested in it and believes it can help. Sometimes the tone gets a little bit preachy and judgmental, too, but if you can handle that it's a good collection of tools to add to your kit as you prepare for birth.<br /><br />It might also help, especially in terms of building a whole team of people who are on-board, if you think of it as relaxation or meditation rather than hypnosis. Sometimes the connotations of the word are pretty far from what this method is actually suggesting, and adjusting that connotation can help a lot.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I Piano Guys 1 and Piano Guys 2 all the time.  I love their music and am so happy they released a second album.
B0072GPPNC|4.0|Excellent movie.  Well done and interesting.  Holds the viewer's interest throughout the entire movie.  Also a happy ending.  The end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this series.  I wanted to have this one as part of my collection since I already have Seasons 1 and 2.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I most certainly absolutely love this game reminds me so much of the one I played as a kid in school.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I thought it was a fun Hollywood movie.  Good if you just want an action movie along with some good laughs. Good cast, too.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie.  Gives the feel of &#34;Munich&#34; (not quite as good)  but an awesome flick.  Not usually an Afleck fan either, but definitely worth the purchase.
B005UKI1EW|5.0|It rained that night in Central Park but never mind.  The concert was still superb, the voices heavenly. If you love music and New York City, you will be in love all over again.  See it with your sweetheart.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this one was great too.  I found the first one more captivating book still couldn't stop reading.  I would recommend all three books

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I liked this movie very much but would have loved to know more about Hitchcock, the man.....his early life and family.
1591845556|2.0|The author gives us two chapters on principles of skill acquisition and effective learning. He then writes a chapter for each of 6 skills he wanted to acquire. Unfortunately what may have been a good idea, suffers from poor execution. The author gives us way too much detail on what he is learning (e.g. the history of yoga and a list of yoga positions) and is very light on how the principles he presented were used. I put the book away after starting on his third learning topic  - touch typing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved all the seasons so much and I can't wait until season 4 starts.  A good buy for anyone that needs a catch up before the next season.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome but it freezes and crashes a lot. I love the game but don't get me wrong
B001BN1ZHW|4.0|It oussed red with a depesques quality!  Production and costums were great!  To bad the story wasn't up to the task......

161655164X|5.0|Assim como o jogo, a arte é de se encher os olhos.<br />(Just like the game, the art is to fill your eyes.)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game didn't disappoint. I have the computer version of Fairway Solitair and wasn't expecting too much here for a kindle version but I was HAPPILY surprised. This is as good, had to get the full version for 99cents. Has all the perks of the computer game like getting the golfing glasses, shoes and other attire that helps in the game. Started out with only 3 holes of golf but as I play the rounds are increasing, game 3 is up to 6 holes.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Brave is a coming of age story that covers the importance of not taking things in life for granted.  The movie has great morals and a well underlying meaning.
0761172726|3.0|This item popped up and I accidently ordered it.<br />It's ok, but not what I wanted, needed more space for putting in all the  activities etc.<br />It's good for what it is, a regular calendar.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Love, love, love it! Especially great having the DVD included in the set. Although like other supporters would have preferred more performance video and less tour footage. That said, I do appreciate their reasoning because it does give a glimpse into the persons and not simply the performers.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome. There are so many different dragons, and you can breed them almost endlessly! Plus, you don't even need to use your own money.

B006VFLIYK|5.0|Engrossing story.  Very well written.  Another great Baldacci novel.  If you want to be consumed by a story, then read this book
B005DL9O5S|5.0|It is Great.I recommend this collection; if you like classical music you are going to love it.You will not be dissappointed.
B005HSL626|2.0|Enjoyed the game UNTIL it started throwing fruit but not allowing me to slash it. I cannot recommend this version.
1451695195|5.0|Fascinating book connecting the scientific world with NDE's (Near Death Experiences) - gives one lots of room for thought - for after life believers like me it gives even more hope!<br /><br />Jim Bedard

B004H4XDBI|5.0|I'm in love with these books - I've read them so fast that I'm sure I missed some stuff, but I was so eager to know more that I just couldn't stop myself. The story that is told is painful and sad, and I think it's very close to reality. The author did a great great job and this story will stay with me for a very long time. I'm going to reread this story very soon, but first I'm going to let it rest for a few. Heavy stuff but beautiful all the way.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|A well written book; but much like the region it's set it, takes it's sweet time. I definitely could appreciate the craft of the writer, but neither the plot or characters weren't seasoned to my taste.  There is a lot of going back and forth over the same clues. 'Cold Dish' has a very nice, realistic touch to everything that happens. I think it's definitely a book worth trying if you like mysteries set in rural settings. The book was just too slow for me and I had to push to get through. It's possible that I'm jaded by the jump-cut pace of many crime novels, but I found this Dish a bit too Cold for me.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm so so sad that this story has come to an end. I've finished it yesterday, it took me only a few days to finish it and I enjoyed every single word of it. It was so intense, so emotional and never did I think 'pfff, boring' or 'pffff this is too much drama'. It was real life problems, pain that you could feel while reading and beautiful and touching, heartwarming scenes and chapters. Although I enjoyed/lived the 'slammed' series, I loved this book more. The writing was top quality, the storylines were superb and the anticipation was building and building. I LOVED it and I thank Monika for recommending it to me. Thank you Colleen Hoover, for such a great and touching story!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Definitely worth playing - this game has a selection of puzzles/games and hidden objects. Challenging without being impossible, you can solve them without getting overly frustrated.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I'm in love with this story and the way it is told. It's actually quite simple but so touching, beautiful and spiritual. I teared up a few times (on a public train!) while reading and I'm starting the second one as soon as I get my hands on it. The author wrote a book which makes you thinking about death, in a nice and comforting way - if that's ever possible. Beautiful and I'd recommend it to everyone (but don't shoot me when you didn't like it!)
B009RH973I|5.0|Wonderful and I don't like pink. But I love this shell. I might get one another colour so that I can might other items.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game! It's easy to lose yourself and clear your mind! I play it all of the time!! GREAT!
1451626096|3.0|It's nearly impossible to write this review without mentioning the forthcoming TV series The White Queen (currently airing in the UK on BBC1, premiering in the U.S. August 10 on Starz). So, let's start by discussing that elephant in the room. Like many fans of Philippa Gregory's novels, I was elated when I heard that her novels The White Queen, The Red Queen and The Kingmaker's Daughter were being adapted into a series by the BBC/Starz. With the recent popularity of Downton Abbey and Game of Thrones, dramatizing the infamous War of the Roses was a no brainer. Of course, I wasn't too happy when I heard that it would air in the UK first (which means, of course, dodging much of the Internet for spoilers) -and I was even more concerned when I starting peaking at some of the reviews from the UK press. For the most part -not positive, and the shows seems to be tanking in the ratings, but regardless I still want to see what the show's all about.<br /><br />Okay, now that we're past that...time to move on to the issue at hand: Gregory's newest novel in the Cousins' War series, The White Princess. The White Princess tells the story of Elizabeth Woodville's (The White Queen's) daughter Elizabeth of York, who was forced to marry the Lancasterian heir, Henry Tudor (Henry VII) to help end decades of British civil war. Elizabeth, of course, is still reeling from the death of her lover, Richard III (and uncle, I might add), and isn't too happy about being forced into the bed of Richard's murdered. And, of course, her marriage isn't enough to completely quell the war, and with enemies around every corner, Elizabeth must protect herself from all threats -even those closest to her.<br /><br />I really hate to say it, but I thought that White Princess was the weakest of Gregory's Cousins' War novels so far. It's hard to put my finger on it exactly, but it seems like things kind of went into autopilot here. The book really felt like it should have been edited down more. It is the longest book in the series, and so much of it is repetitive -Henry must quash yet another rebellion, yet another \\"boy\\" claiming to be one of the supposedly-dead \\"princes in the tower,\\" Elizabeth's own mother continues to conspire against Henry Tudor and Elizabeth herself. It really seems like we could have skipped over the ump-teenth rebellion.<br /><br />But, on top of the repetition and somewhat poor editing, the biggest thing that bothered me was the depiction of Elizabeth of York. To put it bluntly -she was pretty darn boring and seemed more than dimwitted about all of the politics swirling around her. Sure, I'll bet it was tough being married to the enemy and having a mother that wanted to stab your husband in the back, but Elizabeth didn't seem to know the first thing about playing the game and was little more than a boring pawn. Compared to the other ladies that Gregory has featured, Elizabeth of York was the queen of \\"I don't know's\\" and dimwitted-ness. She doesn't seem to have any of the strength or intelligence of the other ladies and comes across as dull in comparison.<br /><br />As a dedicated Philippa Gregory fan, I really wanted to like this book more, but it just wasn't to be. I can only hope that the next (and final) Cousins' War novel will be better.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|This is the 6 episode Prequel; meaning Spartacus himself is not actually in it.  But that said, it really gives you the excellent backstory of what happened before season 1.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A large part of the book is from the German side of the war and that was an interesting insight to human nature -- this book is a good book for history and for adventure.  It is hard to believe how many young folks on both sides were lost in this war.
B00847KFDS|5.0|If you are a Fogerty fan this will be a good add to your collection. The only song I think he should have included is Centerfield but all the rest of his hits are remade with different artists.
B0090SI56Y|3.0|As fun as this movie is, don't be misled by its PG-13 rating. The \\"F-Bomb\\" is dropped in this film along with other words of the obscene variety. If you can duct tape your children's ears, they will love the visuals which fortunately are fairly bloodless. Otherwise, this is a comic book come to life with Hugh Jackman channeling Clint Eastwood and following the standard Marvel script of a mighty industrialist/genius either using his powers for Good or surrendering to the Dark Side. The ending, in which we are treated to some sort of Samurai-Voltran almost ruined the movie but not quite. Check your brain at the door, ogle at Jackman's ripped physique and enjoy the ride.
B00454U1NS|5.0|The title says it all, greatest hits to that point.<br />I like the download option too.<br />My friends daughters borrowed it, and I love the fact that we all enjoy this music. I also like having her daughters listening to a strong, honest female singer!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|I was up to lvl 25 and with the new update I lost everything and was forced to start .<br />all over from the beginning. This sucks!!! The makers really screwed this up with the update. Any ideas on how to get my lvl back?
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Here are my thoughts after one day of use.<br /><br />Installation:<br />I have a TV that doesn't have HDMI 1.4 (i believe it can draw power from a 1.4 device, not sure though). Connected the USB to my TV and it powered up.<br /><br />Installed the Chromecast app on my RAZR. I got the device to go from Step0->Step1 where a 4-letter ID shows up but my RAZR immediately reported an error (saying the communication failed). I just couldn't get it to work with my phone. I finally picked up my laptop. I was able to go from Step1->Step2 where I provided the 4-letter ID. The Chromecast device had serious trouble connecting to my network (I have 2 routers with different names but it wouldn't connect to either of the two routers). After dabbling with the device (turn off, turn on) and the app (restart the app) it finally did connect (although there were no logical set of steps that I could come up with).<br /><br />Use of Chromrcast:<br />First i installed the Chromecast extension and tired out a youtube video. It should be noted that the chromecast device does not mirror the screen but rather works very similarly to the way youtube works with smart-tvs. It sends the appropriate information to the chromecast device and then you are free to turn off the device if you would like. However, this would not allow you to pause/rewind/ff the program you are watching. This is different than the experience that I have with my panasonic tv which allows me to control the programming even after the device has been turned off. This was a little bit of disadvantage.<br /><br />Netflix worked similarly too (thanks for the 3 months of free subscription!) and I found having to go to the device that started the programming to control ff/rewind/pause etc. Not a problem but definitely not an optimal experience as watching the program from an in-built app.<br /><br />Amazon instant video (and I really wanted this to work because I have a prime membership) doesn't work. You can cast a tab from chrome onto the screen. The movie will play too on the screen but it stutters big time. This is because in this case the screen is being mirrored as opposed to youtube and netflix which support the native mode. I hope this feature is included as part of instant video. I wasn't expecting this to work (but was desperately hoping it would!) but this is an observation.<br /><br />I also tried playing movies from my hard drive thro the chrome browser. I saw three issues. a) it only plays some formats even if your laptop is capable of playing more formats. b) video stutters thro. c) There was no audio. Not sure why the browser muted it and did not allow an option to unmute.<br /><br />Video quality (netflix and youtube): In one word, excellent. No stutters, no pixelation (at least 10 feet away). The audio quality is good as well although I do not know if this is 7.1 quality. I haven't tried installing this onto my receiver directly but definitely plan on doing that soon.<br /><br />Still hoping for more streaming apps (especially Amazon, are you listening!) and using an device (not just the one that started the program) to control the programming using the chromecast app. Rather use the app as a simple remote (a touch-pad type remote) would be nice.<br /><br />I must add though that I had no issues installing and updating the Chromecast device from a Samsung-S3. Not sure what the issue with Razr was.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a good light book to read. Author is very good at piecing the past together in the book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this game was like 100 floors until I started playing it!!!! I played this game with my little sister and she kept saying why can't play more levels why can't we go on that level over and over again!!! It was annoying but I can't wait for the levels myself!!!!!!! :)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Here is a learned doctor and scientist giving us an account of his experiences in coma. It is written very well. This area of neuro-science is a new frontier in research and very compelling in our existence.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I love Star Trek and the collection was the best.  It's great following the story, through the movies.  I have a strange, quirky, personality and I even like the movies the reviews were bad on.  The comedy I had not noticed when I saw them at the theater.
B004WYXHAU|2.0|I normally enjoy period pieces, but this series felt rather dull and contrived.  It had some bright moments, but they were few.  The characters are somewhat flat and predictable as well.  I wish I'd watched the first episode before buying the whole season.  That was stupid of me.  At least it's only 3 episodes.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Thank you, was great.  Have enjoyed each and every moment.  love it, love it, love it, love it, love it
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|This album is truly a benchmark for each member of the band. Classic soulful Rock N Roll loaded with juicy bits of solo talent within each song. Billy Sheehan expertly drives each track with plenty of trademark solo highlights. Mike Portnoy- see previous sentence. Richie Kotzen shines at the front of the band. Together, this trio has produced a record that (hopefully) will finally earn them the mainstream recognition they deserve as the superhuman writers and players that they are.
B003GK21U8|2.0|As a huge fan of the author I was very disappointed at the weakness of content , a guy picks up photographs and makes his way to Scotland to be picked up by a u boat , Thats it. His route full of improbable incidences. I still felt I had no idea what this guy was like ( ok meant to be a serial killer )  and the British and German characters I never got to know. I gave it two stars only because the ending on Storm Island was the best part of the whole book. I got the impression that the Author was just fulfilling a contract for a book . Amazing true fact about the false army created in south England .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is the most awesome game ever and I would recommend it very very very much to all my friends oopsey<br /><br />I made a poopsy
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love hidden object games. I Haven't been able to find any good ones on the kindle app store, so happy i found this one super fun
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have to say I was expecting &#34;closure&#34; when this book came out.  I was kind of let down that there wasn't closure, but I look forward to reading more books :)
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Watched again to refresh for Red II. Husband could not remember it, come to find out he had not seen it.  We both enjoyed this movie.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|It's an adequate horror film, nothing amazing, but not really bad either. In all honesty if I had never seen the original films, The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn and Army of Darkness I may have actually enjoyed this quite a bit more. The use of practical effects is by far my favorite part of this movie. The whole using the detox plot line as a way to keep the characters in the cabin isn't as clever or believable as I think the writers may have believed. As soon as you see a cellar full of hanging cats, and a book bound in flesh the smart move is to get out as soon as possible, who knows when the perpetrators of such craziness may return. The original film actually does it in a way that makes a lot more sense, they get there to the cabin and once the demonic faux Latin is spoken, crap goes insane and south too fast to escape. This slower build actually makes the choices in the film seem more cliche and ridiculous. A lot of the camera is directly lifted from the original films but done now with a modern sleekness. This isn't a benefit in my opinion, it's not only a case of seen it before, but a case of seen it before done with a rawness and energy that made it much more effective.  And in the final &#34;boss fight&#34; you're subjected to over the top generic ominous Latin choral music which took me way out of it. Then the music is reprised in the final credits which makes the film feel as though it takes itself way too seriously and this kind of film I feel shouldn't really do that, although I may feel that way strictly due to the original Evil Dead ending to Ragtime music of all things. All that is to say, I can't help but compare it to the original but if you've never seen Evil Dead '81 or you can separate this film from it better than myself, it's a good chance you'll enjoy it a lot more than I did.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can not &#34;not&#34; watch this series, scares the hell out of me, gives me nightmares in the daytime. LOL
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I will be deleting this app - it is just a mess and hate all the ads - loved the previous app and it was easy to use - too bad :(
B009HV2JT8|4.0|What a different perspective about Lincoln. Pretty good as vampire movies go. Not sure if I would watch again, unless nothing else on.
B00E6D4HHO|1.0|The least they could do is leave an empty slot for the upcoming film. It's 9 months away and theyre trying to sell us some lame collection. Why is the collection lame? Because it comes with Wolverines freaking hand and claws...cool. Could have been literally anything else. Magnetos helmet? Xaviers school? A Brian Cox bust? Nope. They cut off Logans hand and stuck it on some crappy box.<br /><br />Even worse than leaving out the sequel to first class is the fact that they are forcing you to buy Xmen 3 and Origins.
B004HAEGP4|5.0|We love watching these movies.  Alice is one of our favorite characters. We own them all. very good movies, if you like that sort.
B004VFN72S|5.0|This a great older movie. Saw it a long time ago and just saw it again.  Enjoy it your self
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does not work with iPhone or iPad iOS. Google should have noted that iOS access is not available for setup at this time. Need a wireless Laptop, Notebook running Windows 7 or 8 or an Android device to setup Chromecast. Cannot be setup using iOS devices.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I really like this stylus with the three different sized tips. I think it's overpriced but I would recommend it to others.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|It is always fun to be introduced to a new author and series. A lot of interesting insight into Australian history and culture.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|PERFECT.....love it thanks to my daughter who ruin my first dvd, I had to re-order but I got to order it in blu-ray so thank you my daughter for scratching my first one. DVD came on time and I am very satisfied.
B00CHMBQ0C|5.0|I don't usually review movies but I think this movie deserves more than the average 3 star ratings on Amazon.<br /><br />The good:<br />Known as \\"The Expatriate\\" overseas, this movie is an action thriller featuring a father daughter duo. The plot is tense, a bit unpredictable, and keeps one engaged and never loses momentum through the end. The actions are realistic and not over-the-top. The soundtrack is great (for an action movie) and builds up the ambiance well. The visual is crisply sharp and beautifully shot in Belgium. The performance of the father daughter duo (Aaron Eckhart, Liana Liberato) is excellent, beautiful, and enjoyable.<br /><br />The bad:<br />I wish this movie could be longer as I feel the latter part of the movie is a bit under-developed. Sometimes the father-daughter chemistry seems a bit drastic (on the daughter's part). The roles of the CIA agent, the daughter's boyfriend, etc. could be greatly expanded. I like the ending, though a little bit more resolution would be nice.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fairly entertaining movie and I'd like to watch it again at some time. It is not a masterpiece but it is nevertheless a great movie that I'd like to own.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Best cd I have purchased in a long time. Love it<br />Toby is awesome and this cd set has some seriously fantastic songs.  Can listen for hours
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Love the extra footage, they were very cool and some were funny. It helps to understand more the plot of the movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Love him or hate him Steve Jobs was instrumental in changing the world through his passion for great design, simplicity of interface and delivering products that we didn't know we wanted but once we had them could not conceive to live without them.  Recommended reading for anyone in business.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|It's one of my favorite childhood Disney movies, It was great seeing it again and to watch it anytime whenever I want.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael always puts out a great product. This is another. You won't be disappointed. He is extremely talented and never disappoints.
B004UHF51S|1.0|Franks always deserves credit for attempting to sew together intelligent, witty, and relevant lyrics--however, all too frequently he sacrifices logic to to rhyme.  Harmonically, he is unadventurous, playing on the see-saw of minor and major sevenths.  Melodically he is repetitive and mundane. He continues to apply Bossa Nova tropes with a primary school mentality.  He has never gotten past the most basic rhythms and voicings of Brazilian bossa nova.  Now, if you really know the Brazilians, from Jobim, Chico Buarque, Edu Lobo, and Marcos Valle to Joao Bosco, Guinga, Toquinho and Ivan Lins,you know that he is doing a terrible imitation of their high school compositions.  Now,the worst of it is that these flaws apply to virtually every one of his albums. These remarkable Brazilian songwriters evolved in critical areas of music whereas Franks remained an adolescent.<br /><br />So--I am sorry to say that TIME TOGETHER is just one more weakness in the Franks musical lexicon.
B0014ERKO0|4.0|Gives closure to the 10 year series. Movie maintains the adventure and spirit of the characters, especially Telk. Nice flick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a Good game for all ages and all types of people. It brings enjoyment and pleasure,  I love this app.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|When tootle reader was pulling plug I tested about 10 replacements by far the best is feedly. It the first app I open on my phone or kindle. I go through the days post then move on with my day. Great find love having it on my devices
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Saw these guys on Letterman and was an immediate fan of these guys. High energy both musical as well as their front man and lead singer who is like the Energizer Bunny on steroids
0345803485|5.0|Loved the books. Read all three back to back. I read alot of the reviews and am shocked by how many people seemed offened by it.. Yes the languange and sex scenes are bold and grafic, and it could be demeaning to women, if the girl wasnt wanting it or drawn to it. It had a good story line its not all about the sex.. I would love to see this book made into a movie.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Comes with a screen protector with is good.<br /><br />This protector looks chunky.  Makes your phone look heavier.  The material which is soft plastic doesn't feel very good to touch.<br /><br />The circular pattern in the back does not look very good.<br /><br />There is no false advertising here.  It is exactly what is described on the product page.  It comes down to the aesthetics.  I don't like something that makes my phone look bad (in my eyes).
B00C2IJJLO|4.0|A very good drama! I've always enjoyed this, and now with blue ray you can't do any better. Picture and Color are tops as is the acting by all.  C6
B00AALX5SI|5.0|My 11 year old daughter and her friends loved this movie.  Behind the scenes on tour give a more personal look at Katy, the person
B008MM9630|4.0|Its a cute little game but I don't like the choices for characters other than that I have no complaints.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I couldn't wait for Season 3 to be available.<br />I am re-watching for the 3rd time!<br />Can't wait for Season 4
B005S9EKCW|2.0|I did not like this film. It did not follow the Broadway show that was so great. What a disappointment.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is on everything!! My Ipad, Kindle, & cell phone. Great way to keep track of recipes. Highly recommend!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game isn't for just kids it's for people off all ages and is fun to play and somewhat addicting no matter your age.  I suggest at least trying it since its free!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is so much easier to play here then on your cell phone! Recommend if you play this game. A+
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs is a fascinating man. There's not much I can say about this book because the reader just needs to dive in and judge it by their self. Jobs was a dreamer, an intense worker, and was very, very human. If you only pick up one book this year, make it this one.
B000028U0Y|5.0|A classic. What can you say about this fine man with so much talent and his music? I will probably wear it out and have to get another.
1423113454|5.0|Rick Riordan does an amazing job of piecing together a story that both captivates the reader, and teaches them a ton about Egyptian mythology without the reader realizing they're getting a history lesson. His imagination is vivid, the characters are distinct, and I loved that the chapters switched from Carter's P.O.V. to Sadie's. It's a great story for anyone interested in YA Fantasy, but would also be a great book for families to read together.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|The movie was previewed by the adults, and we enjoyed it very much. the children of course thought it was fabulous too. Very nice.
B000FBJF7I|4.0|This is a great series of books to read but do start with the first one.<br />They are particularly enjoyable while traveling in Botswana as they<br />give you such a feel for the people, their customs and their landscape.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|I liked this movie a lot, and decided to buy it for my library after I had seen it a couple times. Arrived well packaged and as promised.
0399255370|5.0|I bought this book to use in my classroom. As with all new books I get for my classroom, I read this to my own children first. They loved it!  It is comical and the illustrations are colorful!
B007XHWROK|5.0|The girl this music was purchased for just loves it. She is a Bieber fan, and we appreciate it very much. Thanks.
B00DU73T08|5.0|This was an instant classic, in my opinion. My son and I watched it, he is 14, there was nothing I found that he could not watch in the movie. It was touching, emotional, good plot. Awesome movie. I would recommend it highly. The movie has stayed with me and my son in our memories and we still talk about it.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|It was pretty good. Not the best book ever, but I was on the edge of my chair almost the whole book. All in all, it was a good read.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|The series itself goes without saying as to its excellence. The packaging, and discs are as we expected. Nearly finished the first season which includes the miniseries and no issues. Sound, picture, and experience is much better than broadcast or net streaming. Love the extras!
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Really good app. Very detailed for each function. Even tells the temperature of the phone. Very well worth the $2.
B009R659L8|5.0|I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark books and hope she will continue writing.  I like the characters and the surprising story line.  And I like her integrity in keeping out vulgar words and graphic sex.  I would love my children and grandchildren to read her books.
B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver is a wonderful story about growing up as well as all of the important responsibilities and choices that come with it. A must read for all ages!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I used to live in the area of the UK that much of this is filmed in, and it's just lovely to watch, as I feel like I'm back there!! I love the characters, the stories, the intrigue:) I love it all!!!!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This guy is an awesome writer. I rarely read a book a second time, but I'm reading this one again. I also purchased the kindle version after reading the book in paperback. I can't wait for the third book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The hunger games is a great book! I recommend it for teenagers and young adults. I chose 4 stars because the book fascinated me. I watched the Movie before I read the book but truly this is better. I think that the hunger games is unfair to career tributes and their training early is bad but the games in itself is terribly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun to play. If you love bourses but can own one in real life this is a great game for you
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing is great!  You feel like you are there with the characters.  I recommend this book to anyone that likes to look at different sides to any story.
B005SAP45I|3.0|I've watched Cars 2 several times with my kids.  They really enjoyed the humor and the fact that Mater is featured.  It doesn't have the same 'magic' or meaning that Cars 1 does, but it was definitely worth the watch!
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Our grandkids could identify every character from Star Wars but never saw the movie.  The original release can be absurdly expensive so I was delighted to find this under &#34;used&#34;.  It came in what appeared to be the original wrapping and played perfectly.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|While the movie had similarities to the book...I rather enjoyed the book more!  It was nice to be able to identify the differences
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was lucky enough to get an order in before they sold out and I'm glad my knee jerk decision didn't turn out to be a bad one. My TV streaming tool of choice up until today has been my XBOX 360. So I'll be making my comparisons with it. I am fully aware that the 360 and Chromecast are in two vastly different price ranges, so I'm not saying you should choose one over the other, I'm merely comparing it to an experience that I imagine a lot of people have access to already.<br /><br />I'll quickly touch on setup. Plug it in and connect the USB cable to either the wall or a USB port. I plugged the USB into the back of my 360 and it worked perfectly. I set mine up via the Chromecast app on my Android phone. Basically just name it and put in your Wi-Fi password. Took about thirty seconds before I was able to start using it.<br /><br />I imagine most people are interested in sharing from your computer screen. Sharing your Chrome tab via Chromecast is great, but if the only reason you're thinking about buying Chromecast is to stream internet videos to your TV, you're probably going to be disappointed. I tested with 2 computers, an older laptop and a decent gaming desktop. From the laptop it was unwatchable, at least a 2 second video/audio lag even at the lowest resolution setting. From the desktop there was still a noticeable lag, but it was small enough that I would be able to watch the video at least. So buyer beware, it seems this functionality is pretty dependent on the specs of your source. It's also worth noting that tab sharing is listed as a BETA feature and will likely be improved in the future. Sharing your entire screen is also possible via Chrome, but it is listed as \\"Experimental\\" and not even BETA status yet, so in its current form its uses are fairly limited. I was happy to see though that it does not limit the sharing to Desktop Mode of Windows 8, it will continue sharing your screen even if you switch to a native Win 8 application. Do not purchase Chromecast if you plan to use it to play games from a PC on your TV, it's just plain never gonna happen, and there are much better options for that.<br /><br />YouTube is an almost identical experience with the 360. If you've shared YouTube with a device in the past you're not looking at anything new. I tested Chromecast both from my Android phone's YouTube app and my laptop via the browser and it's essentially the same. Both worked great with no buffering issues at all. The main downside is that if you close your browser/app and want to control the video, you have to relaunch it to control it (it will continue playing if you navigate away from it). As glitchy as the 360 YouTube app can be I could give this one to the Chomecast based on that alone.<br /><br />Google Play Music is probably the feature I like the most so far. I listen to Play Music often and am a subscriber of All Access. Streaming to the TV works flawlessly just as if you were streaming to bluetooth speakers from your phone. Once you select the cast option you just use the app to control your music normally. My only complaint is that the visualization could use some work, it simply bounces around the album art and track info. I'd like to see more on the screen, otherwise there's really no benefit of casting to your TV rather than speakers. I've yet to find a way to stream Play Music via my 360, so Chromecast wins by default.<br /><br />Netflix loaded up quickly and seems to work fine. To be fair, Netflix works fine on basically everything these days, so I wasn't expecting anything out of the ordinary. Since the search functionality on the 360 is pretty horrible I'd rather use Chromecast, but it's not so much better that I would feel the need to turn off my 360 and switch to the Chromecast if I already have the 360 on. One thing I do like better about the 360 app is that it will jump to the next episode for you. With Chromecast it stops after the current episode ends. Casting Netflix from my laptop browser worked exactly the same as Youtube. Note: Closed Caption settings do transfer to your TV.<br /><br />Overall, it's not the best possible device for all of your streaming needs, but at $35 it definitely meets the needs of an average user. If/when they improve the PC sharing capabilities this will easily be a 5 star product. I'm looking forward to more supported applications, but even if they never update it again (which is very unlikely) I still wouldn't feel like my $35 was a waste.ked exactly the same as Youtube.

B001G9FFIQ|5.0|I can't really think of much to say. I'm a huge Metallica fan, I've heard this album 1000 times so hearing it in vinyl was awesome. Great quality, looks awesome. Worth it to me
B00735HGQ6|5.0|This is a well written book, and I especially enjoyed the gentle flow of the story. It was unexpected. It was exciting. It was sad and happy, and spoke to the common burden in all of us. That common burden in our past that effects today, and as much as we try to let go, it holds on. This book spoke deep to me in that place; I will not forget this story.

B006LRUVUA|5.0|TeamViewer allows me to connect to remote computers even when there is a firewall in place. Furthermore, it comes with an excellent set of features which take it beyond just remote access.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Addictive and enjoyable<br />Can't wait to see any future games. I feel safe letting kids play the game and don't worry about them messing anything up
B009G5TWFO|5.0|Great movie! Amazing graphics and the story line made me want to read about the true story. It is aa must see movie.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I watched the entire first season in less than one week.  It was like nothing I've ever seen.  It is better than THE SOPRANOs and DEADWOOD put together.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Even if you don't know much about history, this is a series that must be watched by all ages.<br /><br />Great acting by all.
1452126607|5.0|Just received my calendar, it is a perfect dose of the monthly sarcasm and stellar grumpiness that we have come to expect from our beloved Grumpy Cat. A good size for reading the days and dates and for filling the the room with her piercing stare.  Can't wait to hang it on January 1.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|Enjoyed the game but had to work at it. The instructions and maps were not always clear. Once I got the hang of it, I liked it.<br />..,
B00CWY76CC|4.0|keeps you going and very addicting. its like clue - trying to solve mysteries but trying to figure out how to escape.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Awesome album (CD)!!! I love this band and (in my opinion) this is one of their better albums!! Certainly recommended!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|It was quite predictable but I found it to be entertaining and I am not at all disappointed in it.  I think the graphics were very good, it had some good action, and  a few bad guys.  What more could you ask for.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It is not bad, passes time if that is something you are looking for. A little challenging but nothing horrific.
B005544V6A|5.0|Got totally hooked with the first few episodes and was really suprised by the good acting so early in the season. Some new shows start pretty lame and then the actors settle into their characters - these ones seemed to hit the ground running with believable characters from the first episode. Highly recommend!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Something alien has come to a rest stop on the turnpike (a la the car in &#34;From a Buick, 8&#34;), and several people have less than satisfactory interactions with it.  True to form, taking a bit from &#34;It&#34;, a child does amazing things.  I'll leave it up to you, &#34;constant reader&#34;, to figure it out.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Kinda like a cross between James Bond and Law and Order. Can't get enough! Highly recommend for anyone who likes shows with interesting twists, good plots, good acting, and attractive men (or women for that matter)!
B00CXAAG6I|5.0|Excellent, I love Grumpy Cat and it is very funny stuff. Silly, sarcastic humour that I really like. Three cheers for Tard Cat!

B00AHJL7BK|5.0|To start, I am playing on a tablet, so I was able to see the entire field, even on the largest size setting (15*15, I think). Other reviewers have reported not being able to see the entire field. Not sure if they were playing on a cell.<br /><br />IMHO, this app is amazing. The graphics and color scheme are pleasant and the user interface is intuitive. I read some complaints about not being able to input numbers. It worked just fine for me. The pencil mode also works perfectly and you stay in pencil mode until you press the button to exit, so you can fill in several cells at a time. I think this is the best Kakuro implementation out there. Good job, dev, thanks for a great app. This one is well worth the money if you are a Kakuro fan.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this is the best game I ever played.I just love the part were you get to dress her up and take a pic of her.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|Purchased for use with my Nexus 4, just plugged it to an hdmi cable and the screen was on my tv, couldn't be easier.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|It is simply intelligent, dealing with the Post Cold War world in ways that seem fully on point--along with the necessary ambiguity (sans ambivalence).
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this! This is exactly what I wanted. So happy with my purchase of this item. I highly recommend this!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This was my first Silo book and I really enjoyed it.<br />I wondered what happened outside and the new twists and turns were fun to discover and brought the story forward. I will check out the other Silo books for sure.

B0014D6PCO|5.0|Christopher Nolan does a great job reintroducing the Batman character. I have seen the movie before, and it was still enjoyable to watch again.
B008JFUNWS|5.0|loved this movie cant wait until it comes to Amazon... all of you people should buy this movie...thank you very much!
B006SV2LWA|1.0|This was among the most boring movies I have ever seen. Soderbergh took a really frightening and compelling premise, mixed it thoroughly with a cast of very familiar actors, and a screenplay uniquely lacking in any of the usual drivers of cinematic narrative, and squeezed out a beige, flavorless pap so unmemorable that minutes after finishing my Amazon rental, I have forgotten about 1 hour of the movie and lost close to two hours of my life. Like most people, I work hard every day and my spare time is really precious to me. This movie made me think about how little I value my own life.<br /><br />Take my advice, find a better movie!
B002BRRTUO|4.0|Obviously this movie can be put to shame when it comes to graphics and what not but it is still a fun movie especially if you were a fan when you were younger.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|Although the author's self proclaimed moniker may put some potential readers off, he is at least in the discussion with this series of poems.<br /> According to his preface, they are written from memories of past lovers and encounters, these ladies were very fortunate to meet a man who can form his thoughts into such beautiful prose. Judging from his talent, many must have been swept into his life, (bed?) through the use of his eloquent language.<br /> Even the pieces that are very short have meanings behind them that a lesser poet would need many more words to portray. Producing 30 seconds of reading that creates many minutes of thought takes a special talent.<br /> I especially enjoy when he tells the reader to breath occasionally as a prelude to writing that pushes the bar into more erotic territory. Nice touch, it adds a connection to the reader he obviously had with his partners.<br /> 'Obsession' is a favorite piece, and haven't we all had 'Midnight' encounters at least once in our lives. If you haven't, the author delivers a spot on description, no more than that, he puts you in that place. You experience it the same way you do with all his poems.<br /> I will admit there were several that I could not relate to. However, comparing those to the pieces that I could, I have no doubt they will resonate with others.<br /> Well worth the read and I'm sure the author wouldn't mind if you 'borrowed' his words to help recreate some of these poems for yourself in the flesh.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The writing is fabulous, as the stories always keep my attention.  The cast is perfectly balanced and all of the different personalities meld into the stories beautifully.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have been looking for an app like this one for years.  It has got to be nearly the best relaxation aid I have ever heard of. A great choice of sounds to blend to create hour own personal experience. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! I've never played before today yet it is easily one of my favorites now.<br />The graphics are well done and don't interfere with game play. Works great on my kindle fire. I love that it saves where I left off. Good job.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Of all the versions of Mahjong I've played, this is the most fun.  It's fast paced and great for developing the use of your brain.
B00122MWU6|5.0|Just an amazing album. When I saw it was 4 bucks I had to get it. Could listen to the album over and over and never get tired of it.
B002XHNMVM|3.0|Nice idea: that real education is non-subject based, and putting into boxes kills it stone dead. People learn stuff at their own speed, and loop around, review, restate and redo when they want to, and when they need to.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, as well as Ken Robinson's TED video presentations, from where I found the link to the book (his jokes are getting a bit tired tho'): however, using celebrities as examples of finding ones Element is a teleological argument. Of course they found their Element - but a whole lot more was going their way to make sure that they did (good looks, self-confidence, good genes, intelligence, etc.) what about us ordinary schmucks?<br /><br />I'd like something from him that didn't focus so much on shining examples, but on how everyone can find out how to get enjoyment out of their everyday lives, what you can do for people day to day to encourage people to reject safe mediocrity for risky virtuosity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Picked this up at best buy yesterday and it is awesome! It works seamlessly and is dead simple. For 35 bucks, it's a steal.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was interesting how all of the characters weaved together and intersected lives. I also liked how the author told each part of the story from that character's perspective. I only wish he had included a few more. Overall this was really good. I loved A Thousand Splendid Sun's....but this one was really good.
0670026182|5.0|I ordered this book after seeing it in the recommendations from Amazon. Before purchasing the book I visited the author's website and found it inviting me to see more. I then proceeded to order the book from Amazon. The book itself it beautiful and lovely. I usually spend quite a bit of time reading recipes from a book when I order one, so unfortunately I cannot at this time give a recipe review. I believe that the recipes will turn out very well after reading all of them, and I honestly can't wait to try the recipes. I am an avid home cook and I would say that these recipes are not at all challenging and quite nice for the enthusiastic and frequent home cook.
B0009HLD0K|4.0|You don't have to be from Indiana to enjoy this film. But you might need to have grown up in the 70s. What a fun, innocent look back at a simple life. Family, relationships, passion to do what you love. Sweet.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Michael Moss shows how the food giants hook the children as well as the adults on fast food. It was amazing to me that so many food companies hire scientists so that they can get the optimum level of sugar and fat into the human body. The commercials are designed to attract the children so that they urge their parents to buy the product. The government tries to oversee food guidelines but really does not have the necessary manpower. A book worth reading!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I have been skipping over this movie for some time now.  I ended up watching it on a plane because the choices were so limited on the flight.  I liked it so much that I rented it on Amazon to watch with my wife when I got home.  She loved it.
B008I34XUY|4.0|Frank Zappa's extensive output can seem quite intimidating to the uninitiated so here is a little help. I'll make it simple; start with Apostrophe.<br /><br />Apostrophe is perhaps Zappa's finest album. It features all the essential ingredients from his earlier LPs but the blend is far more palatable. Zappa's voice on this album has a wonderfully deep, rich and very satisfying timbre effectively translating his unique humour and charisma. His lyrics paint such clear comic strip pictures in your mind that it's really worth taking the time to listen to this album properly and watching these pictures pass by your mind's eye.<br /><br />And friends, if you already love Zappa, look up my recent discovery Discharge Lounge, a very tuneful and humourous live band who have some great recorded work out there too, you'll find them on a site called bandcamp:)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|You must take this book seriously. It is not for the casual reader. I did it with my wife and if we were tired or whatever, we did not do it that day. It made a tremendous difference in our understanding of each other. I would have thought my wife's language was receiving gifts, but actually it is gifts of service. Now I know what motivates her. We both like quality time, which we do already. We love it and this book confirms it.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|If you're a longtime ZZ Top fan, you know how awful the remastered Six Pack box set was.  The remasters were truly an abomination and an affront to what ZZ Top recorded originally.  Well, Warner Brothers has corrected that horrible mistake and has given us the original recordings back.  Just hearing ZZ Top's first three albums again in the original form is worth the price of the entire box set.  I finally had to stop playing my original vinyl years ago because I feared wearing it out.  Now I can enjoy the original recordings as much as I want.  The inclusion of the original album covers (even though they are CD size instead of album size) is great.<br /><br />If you're a fan of that &#34;Little Old Band from Texas&#34;, you need this box set.
B0050DZN4K|1.0|I could not get it to work the same way twice. Goofy. That is all I have to say about it.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a brilliant guitarist and this show shows just how brilliant he is.  The songs with Beth Hart are incredible and Jon Hiatt and Paul Rogers bring out Joe's versatility and give him a chance to stretch even further.  This is a must have DVD for anyone that loves Joe Bonamassa, or great blues in general.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|The first in the King and Maxwell series starts and ends with a bang and is a fast read in between. The main characters are likable and have a good banter back and forth that reminds me of Moonlighting with Willis and Sheppard. The story moves along, although the basic premise of losing a presidential candidate twice in eight years strains believability somewhat. However; the manner in which the narrative unfolds helps to keep that strain level low and makes this another success for Baldacci.<br />I read this originally when it was published years ago but have returned to it because of the new King and Maxwell television series on TNT and really enjoy how the other books in the K&M series are interwoven into the new stories.<br />A great read that will have you looking for the other books in the series before you can even finish this one!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Buy this, tap that, earn points...??! All I wanted was the weather, not mounds and mounds of useless other stuff mucking up the screen, options galore that have nothing to do with telling me the forecast, generic landscape photos that actually make it hard to even see the temps on the screen. Plus there's a constant active  notification on my kindlefire for this app and I can't make it go away.  The old version did the job with no flash. This version is all flash and no weather, and simply does not do the job. Uninstall for good.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Smart show. Lots of laughs and good drama and several great characters you come to love and pull for.  A must watch.
B00BV1OT0O|1.0|I bought this item as I like to collect POP toy. I actually paid more for this toy than the others I have owned. However, this minion pop toy was very disappointing. Unlike the other pop toys that I own, this toy has a terrible paint job. All the colour are off the lines and looks very fake. Other stores sell a much better one with a lower price too. I wanted to refund but shipping back was too expensive. Will not recommend unless you do not mind the quality of the toy.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie was funny the first and the second and even the third time that I watched it I LOL
0810993139|5.0|We ordered this for our 8yr old granddaughter after she told us her class was reading the book together. She loves it and spends alto of time reading! This is a winner!!<br />The book arrived within a couple days! That was faster then expected too!!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's a little hard to beat, but I will never stop playing this game! I was worried it might not work based on all the other reviews, but it was worth it when the mb downloaded. It works for the Kindle Fire Hd, multiplayer and all. Definitely recommended for call of duty fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is actually my favorite app of all time.  Every month you're in a new city (Paris, Sydney, Rio, etc) with new avatars and prizes available.  It never gets old and there is always new stuff to earn.  &infin;ly better than temple run.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Needed the two slot charger for travel.  It will charge my iPad and iPhone at once.  Did have a problem at first.  Need to make sure you push it all the way in and look to see that it is charging.
0446554995|5.0|Love, love love all the Pendergast series written by Preston & Child.  I was awaiting this book for some time and everything about it was as predicted:  fast-pace, intense, a quick-read because of the interesting story line.  I won't give away the ending - keeps people guessing up to the last.  Would greatly recommend people to buy this latest in the Pendergast series.  Wonderful!!!!
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I watched this with my 12 year old son and 10 year old daughter, both of whom have had martial arts training. They really enjoyed the movie as a whole and understood about training and tournaments, though the scenes of bullying were a bit intense for them. The scene where Johnny is rolling a joint in the bathroom went right over their heads so I didn't need to have that conversation.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Actually Tom Cruise is very believable as Jack Reacher. I don't understand what Lee Child's fans complain about. Reacher his not just tall. He is confident, top notch and lives to his own rules. And Tom Cruise is great at portraying these features. Who cares he's shorter than Reacher is described in the books?<br />I hope they'll make a next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its great good graphics nice level of complexity ans fun. very animated. love it. can 't wait to keep playing. and the kids too
B006AZZPCM|1.0|It allows me to view videos but when I attempt to download a video it seems like its going to do it but does not actually download anything. I'm on LG Optimus L9 running Jelly Bean.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Bradley Cooper! Robert DeNiro! The awards prove this movie is 100% wonderful. A great watch and highly recommended! Buy it now!!
0316228532|5.0|slow reader! pretty good as I had borrowed it from the library and read in it till I had to take it back with a waiting list I couldn't renew it! now I have started all over again! be warned it is a romance novel and not for kids! it is geared towards adults and has adult sex scenes described in it! can't put it down! about to where I left off last time!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Quick and easy read. I liked how the author tried to include all of the characters of significance, from other books, into this one.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and I'm so glad that I finally got to finish the book! It was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's such an entertaining read.
B000NGTJTY|1.0|I wish there was a rating for movies that tell the number of times the F word is used, such as every other sentence.  And that wasn't the worst part.  We wanted to know the story of Whitey Bulger -- can't it be told w/o disgusting language.  It so detracts from the actual story. We turned it off after the C word came in to use.  No thanks.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A lot of things made sense after reading this book. The only reason I'm on here is to give this book five stars.<br /><br />(I didn't buy through Amazon, my roommate had it and I read it.)
B00A285OOW|4.0|I was excited to be able to review this long anticipated work .The book was riveting and of course I was barely able to put it down after I had started. Philippa Gregory's version of the day to day life of Elizabeth of York was stark and dramatic to say the very least.<br /><br />Henry VII is more obsessed than I could have imagined with the various Pretenders to the throne.Since he is essentially a Pretender himself, this is a bit puzzling. That he was not a good husband to the Princess Elizabeth was not something I had expected, although I don't know why.<br />His mother and he were known to be controlling and cold and he surely was that. The fact that he put to death or imprisoned many,if not most of Elizabeth's relatives should have been a clue.<br /><br />Gregory's belief is that a love had grown between Henry and his wife which his strange behavior eventually extinguished. I found that especially poignant and sad and I grieved for Elizabeth. She seems to have had a warmer relationship with her mother and siblings and her cousin Margaret which is a comfort. She adored her children and she had a comfortable life as Queen of England.<br /><br /> It definitely was not just a story but gripped the heart.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is a great! It is cool that you can battle your friend on Facebook in weekly tournaments. I would recommend it for people of all ages.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is fantastic! Great character development! The plot thickens with every episode. This is a show you must watch!
B003G4W49C|3.0|I thought that enders game was very well written and that end had the perfect personality.  There were many good plot twists that you wouldn't expect. The only bad part for me was that it was kind of long and some parts were a little dry, but all in all it was pretty good
B008NW67E0|5.0|Perfect is all my wife and I can say. Perfect. Especially with some trying times, these boys make us feel better and stronger. Thanks to them for a great album for the ears and the heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game it works great on my kindle fire and I seen lots of videos on minecraft pc version but pe is good to so if you haven't gotten this game yet get it<br /><br />It's worth $ 7.00 trust me
B003G4W49C|5.0|this is a nice book,especially if you are a good sci-fi/alien fan. Card got this book written out good :) Try out the rest of the series if you actually get interested in it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I devoured this book in less than 24 hours. Collins' style of writing and first person point of view make it easy to see through Katniss's eyes. The standard of living (or lack thereof) in District 12 also made me evaluate all the things I take for granted. I  would recommend this book to ANYONE looking for a good read.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Wow. I'm not sure how anyone found this boring. I was nervous before I began, but had only glanced at some of the reviews. I knew this book wasn't popular, but tried not to read too much opinion so as to form my own.<br /><br />This book is may favorite so far! (I have not yet read ADWD). Nothing happens?! There are some great plot points here.<br /><br />The insight into Cersei's head quite fascinating. I read a review from someone who refused to read her parts because they don't like her. This is her at her best! I still don't like her and I love how the reader is privy to her ridiculous innermost thoughts and can see her beginning to fail miserably at becoming the \\"Lannister in charge\\".<br /><br />I would have loved more Arya. What you do get, though, shows how she is changing and becoming someone new, even though parts of Arya still shine through. I can't wait ti get more of her story.<br /><br />Admittedly, Sam bored me for a while, I admit, but even his story improves later in this book.<br /><br />I know, I know, Jon Snow and Daenerys are absent from this book. A whole book without The Mother of Dragons?!?!?! I accepted it because I assume she'll sow up in the next installment and it helps that I was forewarned of her absence.<br /><br />The Dorne intrigue, Lady Stoneheart and The Maid of Tarth... I can't fathom how anyone thought nothing happened in this book.<br /><br />Off to read the 5th installemt and hope it lives up to this one
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Bad Luck and Trouble is one of the best Jack Reacher stories you will find.  Reacher has never been more complex, nuanced, and human.  Bad Luck and Trouble sees Jack reuniting with his old Army colleagues, and the team approach serves to really capture the essence of his character, helping us understand Jack's captivating sense of loyalty, duty, and honor. The action and pace are superb, but the vivid characters are what really stand out, helping make Bad Luck and Trouble a must read for Reacher fans.
B004GJXQ20|3.0|Like so amny readers of the series, I came in after watching the show. After season 3, I couldn't wait any longer to find out what comes next. (Though before that I was content to learn from the show, preferred it, in fact.)<br />I did not love this. Many times I thought, if I were not already invested in the characters, I wouldn't bother reading this. I know people who don't watch who tried to read this and gave up and I couldn't even berate them.It's long, it's drawn out and it can be complicated to figure out who's who. Please note that I am an avid reader, I enjoy complexity and don't mind a lot of brainwork. For some reason though, this book just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I love the genre, I already loved the story. Please see other reviews and realize it's not this whole series I am ambivalemt about, just this book. I finished the first 4 so far and really enjoyed some. Martin's style in this book to me seemed dry. I do understand that having seen season 1 a few times, and already knowing what happened could have affected me, but I honestly don't think that was the problem.<br /><br />If you are deciding whether or not to read these, I still say, \\"Go for it!\\" Just understand that for some people it's tough to get into it for a while. It is worth it for the later reads, though.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|This is the second time I have read this novel. It is without question one of the best stories of our time. Jon Krakauer is a wonderful writer who has written a great story. A sad story, but a great page turner.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I didn't love the first book in the series, and this one was a bit better. There is some more depth to the characters. We get to see some as they really are and see some start to become who they are really meant to be.<br />I'll be honest here, if you read them one after the other and quickly, without immediately reviewing, it's tough to remember where one book ends and the next begins. I admit that I read these because of the show so that helps me place events, anyway- at least through season 2.<br /><br />I like that people and plots begin to mingle more as we move deeper into the story. Again, I wasn't in love with GRRM's style. That changes as I moved through the series. I don't think his style did, amybe I just adapted to it. Anyway, this isn't the best of the series at all, but read it and keep going.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As many other readers, I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan. I read all the novels and had been eagerly awaiting this one, rehearing American Gods & Neverwhere to tide me over. Haha!<br /><br />And then finally...it arrived. It's unlike Gaiman's other books. Yes here is the magical, fairy tale quality to it, which is why we all love him. It has that darker edge, as many of the books do. But still, this was different. Because...I'm not really sure how to explain it other than it hit me in an emotional spot usually reserved for real memories..good & bad. Or we're they real? That's the part you have to figure out.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Wow. After just thinking the first 2 were ok/pretty good, A Storm of Swords was the kicker. I truly fell in love with the series in this book.<br />Is it possible that up until now I was just trying to get through because I already knew what happened? Maybe? But this book is where we see a bit more of people becoming who they are meant to be. Characters aren't great unless they evolve somehow. Static characters don't stick with you. GRRM's characters are quite dynamic.<br />There characters you love to hate and those you hate to love, but not many you'll feel indifferent about, especially after this book!<br />The plot twists will make your head spin! Just when you think you've had all you can take, there's a ton more intrigue, drama and betrayal thrown at you. This is the book during which my husband thought there was something wrong with me because I kept reacting to events out loud. It was so hard not to! You need someone else who has read these so you can discuss.<br />I went right from book one to book two and right from two to three. I took a week off for lighter fare after this because this book was so intense. That is a good thing. i had to let it process and mull it over before I could move on. Huzzah, GRRM! Well done, indeed.
1885167776|5.0|This book transformed my outlook on productivity.  I used to struggle to get up in the mornings and after reading this book, immediately began setting my alarm for 5:45 and getting up to get things done before the interruptions start.  Do one thing, and do it well, without distractions- consistently.  Then all the emails and busy work can come next.  I really recommend this book.  I ended up buying several copies for my friends- and even had the nerve to give a copy to my boss (not that he needs it, just thought he would enjoy it too!).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|First I have this app on my phone.it has a search phase function on the phone.I haven't found search function on my kindle fire but that's the only drawback.it is ok
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent book about Alzheimer's Disease, written in the person of the one having Alzheimer's.  It is fiction but is supported by real facts. The author has done extensive research on this disease and presents a believable view of Alzheimer's as experienced by the one afflicted.  I loved the book so much I am now reading Left Neglected by the same author.  It is just as good!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is a great movie.  It shows how the CIA patiently tied together all the various leads and bits of information to eventually pinpoint Usama Bin Laden's hideout (in Pakistan(!), the country that put the 'lie' in 'allies').  Even though you know how everything is going to turn out, it still is an exciting and suspenseful telling of the story.  It deserved the Academy Award but lost to the insipid, Hollywood-centric bore 'Argo'.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie you will want to watch at least once every year.
B00821OX98|5.0|could not stop watching it. I watched all of season One .Than season Two, Falling Skies is a great show.

B007QPFGJW|4.0|Spoiler alert!!<br /><br />Bye bye Harry, I could not believe he was killed off. Great story line about drugs and the life of junkies. Oleg turned out easy different than you'd expect from the other novels. Not sure what Nesbo will do next without Harry....
B002KGEORM|5.0|I love this show.... It has everything u could want, drugs, sex, and rock&roll!!! Love it a lot!!!! Jax for president !!!!
B008JFUR10|1.0|I've watched everything Guillermo Del Toro has done starting with \\"The Devil's Backbone\\" and enjoyed and admired just about all of it.I thought he had a few misses with films he produced but those productions he directed or was closely associated with were always worthwhile entertainment. To be sure, there's a childlike fascination that runs through his work and connects to that same vibration within the viewer. Unfortunately that child must have been thrilled beyond comprehension with watching \\"Godzilla\\" and that same adolescent went on to make a movie about it.Big things that kids can control have been a staple of childhood since tin soldiers. Here's a movie that you've seen before (called 'Transformers\\") beating up on flesh and goo monsters from under the sea from another movie you've seen on late night.Although there's always that \\"new generation\\" angle that studios use to mask a lack of creativity, most audiences are familiar with the basic content of films like these. This one is loud, obnoxious and inane. The way that Europeans see Americans. Now you have to include one Mexican born director in that circle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I was going on a trip to Vermont and I decided to get this game for the trip.  I had no clue that I was about to find my new obsession!!  Constantly playing this game and its an amazing free app.  The only ads are before the game!!  This app is a must have!
B004U8VWLE|5.0|A believable and intense story-line is carried out beautifully by everyone in this story of obsession, jealousy and art. The seedier side of the opera world is exposed as a director and stage-mother drive a young woman to insanity.

0399255370|5.0|Full disclosure here, as an author myself, I'm always inspired by those particular books that go outside the box. This book is so clever in doing just that. Who would think of a book about crayons complaining about their working conditions? It is so genius. I absolutely love the bitter feud between orange and yellow. This book had me laughing from beginning to end. I didn't want it to end. I wanted to hear about more colors. Great work and idea.

B003VDX6N6|5.0|Great show that keeps getting better<br /><br />Stick with it, the first few episodes just get you used to the characters, it's really nicely done.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I play on my Kindle Fire. I haven't had any of the glitches that the other reviewers listed.  Works with my Facebook although the app doesn't have as many of the power ups. Facebook lets me choose between 5 different ones &amp; the kindle app only lets me choose from 3. Either way it is lots of fun.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Like the title states, it's Dream Theater! This album is progressive, very technical, very musical, however, this album has something that I find Dream Theater to be lacking in quite a few albums; soul and emotion. Now, Images and Words and Awake had emotion! Very good albums. However after that, I don't know, it just seemed a bit lacking in the emotion. This album makes a return to that. James actually never sounded better than he does here (except for on the next album, Systematic Chaos). John P. shreds it up and really does his worth on this album. John M.'s bass is even more impressive on these songs! Portnoy is just amazing! LaBrie really puts his heart into this album and Rudess plays very well here, too. This isn't their best record. This isn't their worst. It's kinda in the upper-middle. Awake and Systematic Chaos (in that order) are my favorites from the band.<br /><br />The music:<br /><br />1. The Root of All Evil- This starts off the album with some interesting synth sounds and it's very eerie. The drums have one little rumble that keeps repeating, louder each time and it really starts off creepily, but I like it! This then bursts into a really heavy DT classic! This is another installment of Portnoy's 12 Step Suite and it may be one of the best parts of it. This song really grooves, it rocks, it really is a song to turn up! At first it's an aggressive song and very anger-driven, but at other parts, it's very touching and very emotional. Like I said, James' voice hasn't sounded better up to this point in their career. As for the music, Portnoy's drumming really drives this song, Petrucci's guitar is very in your face for a lot of it, but at other times, it's atmospheric, more laid back, and it adds more beauty and emotion to this song. The song is 8 minutes in length, but it doesn't get old or drag on because it's Prog! It changes a lot and keeps moving! As stated, the music on this song is indeed top-notch! Great intro song! One of the album's BEST!<br/><br />2. The Answer Lies Within- This song starts off with some cricket sounds and then a pretty piano part comes in. This is more uplifting and it's delivered as a piano-driven ballad. James really shines on this song. The full band plays on the song, though. There is also a string quartet in here as well. The music is actually very laid back, especially for Dream Theater standards. I like it. They needed this! The music actually breathes, the emotion REALLY comes through, and in short, they couldn't have done anything better with this song. This is among Dream Theater's best ballads. The string quartet is utilized perfectly here and and J.P.'s guitar playing is very sparse, yet anything more, would've killed the song. A solo might have been appropriate, however, the song is still great without one! Great song here!<br /><br />3. These Walls- It took a while for me to warm up to this one, but this is actually a pretty good track. Musically, it's very heavy and driving, not to mention technical. This song actually sounds like stuff that we would hear off of Systematic Chaos (in a very good way, I love the sound of that album). This song is very progressive because the intro is heavy and then the verse is softer, yet still epic! This song is the one crowning triumph here! At first I really didn't get this song, but NOW, I personally think that this song is the 2nd best song on the album (only behind Panic Attack). This song triumphs because of all the songs, this really shows the return of emotion into the band's music. LaBrie has been showcasing his emotion on the previous songs, the band showed more emotion on the ballad, but on a song with this heaviness in the chorus and other parts, this really signals the return of emotion! This song really gallops along with a storm of riffing and the piano really adds that emotive factor that I love! The guitar solo in this song isn't very technical and I LOVE IT!!! J.P. has a lot of technical skill and talent, but I honestly hate his solos. They may be very skillful, but they don't do anything for me. This one, however, is much more focused on emotion than skill. Honestly, it takes more skill to play less and make it work, so he's evolving as a musician! GREAT, GREAT song here! I didn't think this one would grow on me as much as it did!!!<br /><br />4. I Walk Beside You- There are mixed reviews for this song. I personally like it. This song alone, isn't metal, but it's an uplifting rock number. People say U2 and I honestly agree. This has a definite U2 vibe to it, however, it WORKS! I think they did a good job emulating that style, yet they still made it own! The drumming here is still Portnoy, the guitar is a little more subdued, but it is still Petrucci and Myung's bass will always be his. The keys aren't as audible, but I think without them, the song wouldn't have the same atmosphere that it does. The vocals are nothing short of great! I enjoy seeing this band explore new horizons and this song is no exception! Good song!<br /><br />5. Panic Attack- BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!! By far, this song ROCKS!!!! It's a very dark, brooding song! The drumming is just awe-inspiring! The guitar is very technical, yet it isn't overdone! The bass and keys really add to the atmosphere through this song! The true star here is LaBrie. This song is the one he shines on the most! He really delivers on this one! He delivers a great emotional performance and the band just serve up a shredding frenzy! The progressiveness of this song is also amazing! I would LOVE to learn how to play this song! It sounds very challenging, but a whole lot of fun!!! This song is actually one of the best songs DT has made. The only songs that really rank with it are 6:00, In the Presence of Enemies Pt.1, and Constant Motion. This song really is a DT classic! The instrumental alone is just phenomenal! Jordan's key solo is very good! The guitar solo, however, is only thing in my eyes that brings this song down. I just feel like it's too overly technical and shows no taste or emotion! But then after the solos, a key/guitar harmony comes in and I LOVE IT! THIS is the song's best moment! The guitar part for this section would've been better suited as a solo. However, in respect, this is a fairly small complaint as the song is still GREAT! AWESOME SONG!!!!<br /><br />6. Never Enough- This song was never a favorite, but it never grew on me. The intro sounds very good and very intense, but after that, I just don't like it. I can't put my finger on it, but something about this song really annoys me. It's ok.<br /><br />7. Sacrificed Sons- This is another very good song! It starts off with some radio clippings and static. Then it all cuts off and the band comes in. James comes in and gives the music more emotion than it started with. This song is very beautiful! The guitar part is very sparse and the music has a lot of breathing to it! It slowly builds up. The music starts off very slowly, but around 4:00 the music really kicks in and it becomes very driving, very heavy, and the guitars just become AWESOME! This is some very intense progressive metal! There are a good amount of solos in here, just one solo to the next. They are trading off from John P. to Jordan and back. Then the last guitar solo becomes very emotional and acts as a musical climax. Then it becomes driving again. The music here keeps changing up, never skipping a beat! Overall, this is where the album should've ended. This song wold've been a perfect ending. It's majestic, yet it still ends with a bang! GREAT song!!!<br /><br />8. Octavarium- Honestly, the music is very good on this song. The emotion is there! However, the song itself just doesn't go anywhere. I gave this song a chance to grow on me, but I don't like it. The length doesn't bother me except it doesn't really go anywhere. Symphony X's The Odyssey is comparable in length and is a much more epic musical journey. This song, by comparison is just bland and is there just to extend the album's length. Sorry, but this song isn't for me.<br /><br />Verdict- Dream Theater is the most recognized act in Progressive Metal! However, even with as good as this album is and even with as good as their best albums are, they aren't the best. That title goes to Sweden's Evergrey. But, anyone who appreciates progressive music should pic this album up! If you are new to Dream Theater, do yourself a favor and start with either [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]] or [[ASIN:B000002JPA Images & Words]]. Those two are much better in terms of quality and in terms of accessibility. This album is good too, but it might bore first time listeners. All in all, it's worth it if progressive music is your thing.
B000AP04MO|4.0|2 for the Road used to be my favorite film. It's still romantic, wistful ( at times very funny ) with a GREAT soundtrack by Henry MAncini and beautiful footage of coastline Europe.<br /> Audrey Hepburn is beautiful and the chemistry between she and Albert Finney is fantastic. If you want to see them at their peak, a lovely story about singleness and marriage.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|My mother in law recommended this show to me, and honestly at first I thought she didn't really know what she was talking about.... History channel and Vikings?  Boy was I wrong!!!  This show blew me out of the water.  Great acting, wonderful storyline and the scenery is just amazing.  I couldn't watch the series fast enough.... season two seems to far away!

B00821BLX4|1.0|I find it amazing that a company sells a special ring that one must have in order to use other lenses that must be purchased separately.  Since I wanted the other lenses, I reluctantly bought it.  It should have been included with the camera as an encouragement to purchase the add on lenses.  Better yet the camera (which I really like) should have been designed to handle the other lenses.

B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This movie was greater than I expected. while Tom Cruise is not one of my favorite actors, he is indeed very talented and continuously proving that I should include him in my favorites. Tom Cruise was magnificent and the movie was beyond exciting and full of mystery.  I absolutely loved it.
1490313370|2.0|I think a lot of his experiences (lessons learned) are unique to him and don't have much to say to anyone else not to mention being self centered.
B00CUWKHVI|4.0|Finally I got some time to listen more closely to Jamie Cullum's latest record: Momentum<br />Where almost all artists claim their last record is surely their best, Jamie would arguably have a point in doing so.<br />Love it or hate it, Momentum is a near perfect pop record. So fans of his more jazzy earlier records should maybe look elsewhere.<br />What Jamie does better each record is to load each song with strong hooks and memorable choruses. Each track could be a highlight if there would be only weaker songs on the album too. In fact there is one: \\"Love for sale\\" misses a strong melody and is not a very successfull attempt at doing rap I believe.<br />What stays on each album is Jamie's fantastic loose style of singing, and the wonderful organ and piano solo's on most songs (like the squeeking organ on \\"The Same Things\\", or the delicate tingling on \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"Sad Sad World\\").<br />The songs \\"The same things\\", \\"Anyway\\" (with an irresistable stumbling rhythm), \\"Everything you didn't do\\" and \\"When I get famous\\" are very catchy, while \\"Edge of Something\\" and the album closer \\"You're not the only one\\" have a more fully orchestrated sound. \\"You're not the only one\\" with its triumphant organ melody wouldn't even be out of place on a Coldplay record...<br />If I would have to mention one real highlight, then it would be \\"Pure Imagination\\" for me. During the piano solo I get a feel of the paradise Jamie is singing about. That's really as beautiful as music can get!

0399226907|5.0|My baby daughter is starting to become interested in books, and board books are a safe drool-friendly start.  I had to pick this one up, and it's just as clever and cute as I remember it from my school-teaching days and my own reading.  Carle's illustrations are bright and timeless, and this story of a caterpillar with an appetite is downright charming.  Those looking for a sneaking-in of education will appreciate the weekday and counting lessons, and the distinct colors provide a lesson as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too simplistic and not too obscure either.  Very nice graphics.  Just have ti remember to try everything and look everywhere
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Seemed overly drawn out. The Hobbit was easy reading, imaginative and low drama except for Smaug.  This movie is the Hobbit on a bad trip with new content not from Tolkein and dramatic where these was none.  Rock monsters fighting, really?<br /><br />Guess Hollywood felt like why charge for one when we can charge for two instead?  Not recommended.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Received my Chromecast yesterday and got it working within a matter of minutes.<br /><br />Sure you can do nifty things like stream Netflix or Youtube videos directly to it, but I can already do this through my Xbox or through the SmartApps on my TV or home theater.<br /><br />To me the cool thing is that you can stream the content of *any* Chrome (web browser) tab directly to your TV. What does this mean? It means you can stream ANY video displaying on your web browser. If you can fullscreen the video it will play fullscreen on your TV accordingly. The video (depending on the resolution) isn't going to be as smooth as it is in the native streaming formats like Youtube or Netflix, but it works.<br /><br />I have my Chromecast plugged directly to my TV, and through audio return channel (ARC) any audio played through it gets sent back to my home theater system. This is a huge benefit as I can stream tabs of Pandora or Songza and listen to the audio through my home theater speakers.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to order it early and get the Netflix promotion which applied a $24 credit to my Netflix, meaning this cost 11 bucks. But even at its full price I'd recommend the Chromecast. It simply doesn't get easier than this product!
B00DYWO09I|4.0|I like it a lot but is a little short. The graphics are awsome the history like a classic prince

B007C52NY2|5.0|delivery was on time. my friend read the books and passed them on to another friend who is reading them now. both of them loved the books.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is no brainer for people like me for whom watching TV means watching movies on Netflix or Youtube Videos. It takes only few seconds once cast button is used to get video on TV screen. I have a smartTV but I'm very happy that I no longer need to use the weird TV interface keypad (selecting one letter at a time) to type a movie or search for a video. You can do it using your laptop, any smartphone or tablet device.<br /><br />Watching videos using Chrome browser is not perfect and at times video and audit get out of sync. I hope it gets better.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and only it took me less than 5 minutes.<br /><br />Device was packaged very well if that matters for anyone.

B00AHJL7BK|4.0|It's not a bad rendition of the game, though the controls are a bit clunky and there doesn't seem to be any way to adjust the difficulty level.<br /><br />If you're not on a kindle fire you won't be able to see you scores either, as it requires &quot;amazon game circle&quot; to display them.
B00821PCJS|4.0|... a gritty series about a ragged army unit and a group of civilians seeking shelter. Once again, ala War of the Worlds, a complex and ruthless enemy is bent on enslaving or eliminating humanity.Yes, there's a romance or two, but the big antidote to alien firefights is betrayal. Who's in cahoots with the bad guys? Who's in it for themselves? Who has been programed as a spy? Who's left humanity behind and shouts &#34;Give me liberty, and give you death.&#34; It's impressive how much ordnance is just lying around for our heroes to use as they race to save the species.
0316056898|2.0|The first forty pages of \\"Bossypants\\" contain so many grammatical and punctuational errors that I simply couldn't stand it any more.  This book is definitely not for people who deeply value the English language.  Additionally, Fey tells each story in short bursts, none of which make it past five pages (at least not in the first third of the book) and so there's nothing to hold the reader's interest for very long.<br /><br />On the positive side, there are some excellent one-line jokes.  I can imagine Fey telling some of these stories to a live audience and her delivery being a huge success, but her skills as an memoir author come nowhere close to matching her skills as a performer and script writer.

B00D3LA5WG|4.0|The film centers on 14 year old Ellis (Tye Sheridan) who along with his friend Neckbone (Jacob Lofland) befriend a fugitive who lives isolated on on island in the middle of the Mississippi near Arkansas. Eliis learns hard lessons in life as he attempts to help Mud (Matthew McConaughey) all the while his parents are getting divorced and his whole life is changing.<br /><br />This is an interesting film involving character. The action moves at a medium pace while building and exploring character. A film more for indie lovers than those of the action genre. Worth a view.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some adult themes.
B008476HBM|5.0|Been putting off reading this worthy tome for the thick end of half a century.  Eventually succumbed to the temptation of a free Kindle edition, and totally seduced by Austen's prose.  Wish that I had read it years ago.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I have never seen a movie that used a cause to display endless, mindless violence to that extent. This was utter trash.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|Glancing over the fact that the movie doesn't follow the book, this movie is still terrible. Living in the South, I can tell you that those were the WORST Southern accents I have ever heard. The actors were way too old to be playing teenagers (I work with teenagers, they don't look like that). The special effects were a disaster (the dining toom scene!). And they didn't really develop the story - was I really supposed to believe they loved each other after just 2 days?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is very fun and entertaining and also very addicting I love playing it one of the best games I have
055358202X|1.0|For this installment, Martin apparently decided to publish a book meant only to wring a few more nickles out of the franchise. It's 700+ pages of pure tedium. Almost nothing happens. The entire book is dominated by trivial side stories that go nowhere, the character list has swollen to over 800, each chapter contains page after page of banal conversation, the story in the first three volumes has been set aside. . .<br /><br /> Skip this book. It's pure crap.
0345525558|3.0|This was for our book club ... nice book, good story but not something I couldn't put down ...  just love a book where it;s so interesting that you need to read  to the end !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great it lets you keep a horse while you groom it and go into competitions. It would have had 5 stars if not for the fact that the horse requires a lot of attention 24/7.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|Well, it was certainly not as good as &#34;Phantom&#34; ... I saw were he was coming from and the best song was one sung by Kiri Te Kanawa on his &#34;birthday celebration&#34; evening which Andrew introduced.  &#34;Love Never Dies&#34; or &#34;A Heart is Slow to Learn&#34;  Kiri Te Kanawa was brilliant on his 50th b/d show ...
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|This is a good app. for helping with memory, it is also a lot of fun too. I like it a lot.
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Great band movie, the slaps hot of music based movies...an all time classic - seven more words required so now I can submit
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|The movie was sub par. I love die hard movies but its about time to close the movie series. The action scenes were pretty good but so unrealistic
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Not an action drama, but more like a British soap drama. Lots of atmosphere and costumes and some old cars.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Gr8  entertainment for everyone in the family. Wonderful story with exciting and magical adventures with fantastic vibrant colors that jump off the screen and make u feel like u r in oz
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Netflix and Youtube work great on this though I already have other ways of getting them on my TV like many people.  The most useful feature for us so far is Chome tab cast of Hulu and Pandora One, both work perfectly and am especially happy as the best quality 192K Pandora One audio feed is only available on a computer/laptop, all my other sources (like Squeezebox, web radios, etc.) are 128K.  I needed to use the supplied USB power adapter when I plugged this into my Sony AV receiver but it turned out this was well worth it because when I cast a Chrome tab the receiver powers up and switches to the correct HDMI port automatically and this works fine with the TV off when I'm only interested in audio.  Also FWIW I bought mine at my local Best Buy Friday 7/26 and to my surprise still got the 3 months of Netflix service despite the earlier announcement that Amazon and Google had stopped doing this.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I couldn't put this book down because I was so into it. It was emotional and captivating. Kept me going back and forth -- was he guilty or was he innocent? The only thing I did not like about the book was the author's tendency to labor over the same details at length over and over again --- particularly his wife's change in physical appearance. Ok, I get it, she lost weight and the stress of the trial got to her. This may just be the author's style, but I don't know since I haven't read any of his other books. Overall though, this was a good read, one you want to keep going to find out what happens to this family.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|Read the two existing books in this backwards (the Hit first), which will scew this review a bit.<br /><br />The first 1/3 of the book is unusually simplistic in approach for Baldacci, but gathers speed and complexity nicely midway through. The new characters are introduced and developed well in this 1st edition of this series, but do dwell too long on the first two people you meet.  Moves better in the end, but telegraphs the villan a bit early. Does set up THE HIT well. Be patient. A Tom Clancy novel this isn't.<br /><br />RLF
0688101364|5.0|This big is wonderful, the recipes clear and they work every time<br />The seller delivered in the time frame as promised<br />I would buy from them again<br />I would buy books by this author again
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game is very entertaining! I like how there is different places you can play in does not lag or does not load and it works good
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My son loves playing this game! My older daughter plays too. Great game for young players. Recommend this if you child likes racing games! Enjoy!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina being Tina is funny.  End of story. Since I have to write 12 more words to leave this site then Tina should also get a Pulitzer Prize for literature.
B009KUWWW0|5.0|Don't want to put the book down. It just keeps you turning page after page to see what  is going to happen next.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Was so ready to put this series to bed and be done with it. I only ordered this last book because I wanted to see what the conclusion was, and then...! Spoiler Alert! It still doesn't end!! This book dragged, and dragged, and dragged for me. Seems like nothing was accomplished besides more trouble.
B009WUBERW|4.0|This is a good movie in some ways better then the first. It's funny to see all these older actors still trying to act tough. Either way they still got it cause it's a good movie
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I read the first book, pretty much liked it, and was definitely compelled to read the next. I still feel its a bad rip off of the 50 Shades of Grey series, and just a little more disturbing. Something about it doesn't sit well with me. Can't concentrate on the romance when I feel all icky about it. :(
B004XZR63M|5.0|If you are struggling financially, you should read this book!!! I ended up taking the free three hour class, then went on to take the three-day seminar and that was the best financial move of my career!
B00DMM3WVM|3.0|It felt almost like a temple run style game just with zombies and less of a specified path. It was fun for a few runs then got boring.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|The first ten to twelve levels have lots of fun tasks and it s great to build the reef. WE`'re now at level eighteen and the past six levels are long and don't have many tasks. We haven't had a visitor or guest in many many levels. It's a good child's game but not a toddlers game because of the ease of buying with real money. You have to watch what your kids are doing all the time. The treasure chests are a rip off...beware!
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|Was great fun for the whole family loved watching. laughed and I cried. would watch it again and again. Don't miss out.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I really like this game.  Get a little annoyed when this app takes more than one life when I play; but because I like this game I keep coming back to it.
B000065V42|5.0|Loved it ever since it came out. Great movie to watch over and over. My whole family loves it watch it often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really love this game very awesome to me and my mom when she saw to playing it she said what is that game I said it's Despicable me minion rush so she downloaded the app on her phone and  she's been playing it ever since..... ps, ME and my mom loves it keep up the go work can't wait to see what's new from you company.!!!!!!!!!!!!

B004DLPXAO|2.0|This does not take you to your library, you only get the store. It is hard to find your books.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Was right up there with the wizard of oz was very well done will watch it again best movie of the year
B005LAIGN2|5.0|We watched this movie over and over and liked the story line.<br />The actors were great and  enjoyed that it was a true story.<br />I would recommend it to everyone
B004A8EI9M|1.0|Watching this show was a painful experience.  After a few episodes of this awful garbage was crammed down my throat I actually had to ask \\"can we please not watch this anymore?\\"  Nothing happens... ever.  There's zombies and a few backwoods idiots who have survived somehow.  The worst part of this show is the dialogue between characters in moments that look like everyone has expressions like it's important but the talking is just as useless as the zombie groaning around them.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I love Michael Buble and have all his records and enjoy his voice and<br />the songs he sings. If I get a chance to go to a concert I will.<br />I do recommend him to everyone. Everyone knows I love him.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I've never been so drawn in to a tv show before.  It took a couple of episodes for it to happen.  About halfway through the first season I was sitting on the edge of my seat, couldn't wait to see what happens next.  But that never stopped.  They managed to make every episode for four straight seasons build up so slowly but consistently.  Every episode left me thinking \\"it's over now, either his family will find out, the DEA will bust him, the cartel will murder him\\" and he makes it through these situations, but in a believable way.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Fabulous movie!  I have seen it about 5 times now.  Clever, intelligent--the movie takes you into a world that I never experienced and I think it is a story that should be told.  A serious subject but with a hilarious twist.
B002EXGQO0|5.0|Cate Blanchett did a awesome job had me interested the entire time. I normally get bored by these movies but this one had me stuck!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. It was easy read and kept me engaged the whole time, which is really hard for me.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Grandkids love this game! They play it from the time they come for a visit until I make them get off. :-)<br /> Thanks for making it available.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I picked this book up after a friend suggested it to me. It is sad, especially when dealing with the topic at hand, but was nicely written and one of my favorite books. I would highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really easy to setup.  I have multiple Android and iOS devices and have tested the current functionality with both.  Obviously this works better with Android as you have access to both Music and the Play Store Movies and TV.  The Netflix integration is good and is pretty fast.<br /><br />Most video from websites and even local content play, within 10 seconds the audio syncs up.<br /><br />Overall this is a great little gadget, for the tech inclined.  Once other services (Hulu, Amazon, etc.) are added this will be an easy recommendation.
B00BN3EE1O|5.0|I read Sparks' book a few years ago and I could not wait for the movie to come out. I actually rented the movie off of Netflix first and before it was even done, I was ordering it off Amazon on my phone. LOVE Sparks' books and movies, and this was no exception. I like that, unlike most of his movies/books, this one had a happy ending. Recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There is no way you can foresee where the author will take you next.<br />This is a great read!!!<br />Couldn't put it down.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love anything from Sparks, and this was no exception. I would highly recommend reading this book- I finished it in one sitting, in one night.
B003RT0NK8|5.0|I liked the concept of the movie and the overall dark tones of the movie.<br />The soundtrack alone is worth watching the movie.<br />The version of Adagio in D Minor is fantastic.<br />Watch it if you're interested in science fiction style movies about possible worlds end themes
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am in love with this series. Although it is a little &#34;Cinderella&#34; story for this generation, I did enjoy the books. I would recommend the series, but have had a lot of friends with teenage daughters wanting to read it. I am not a parent, and parents are free to do what they wish, but I would be skeptical on who reads the book.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I'm hooked on this game..It is fast paced and fun..I  reccomend it highly!! If you like to build your. Own city..this is the game for you.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another solid and enjoyable way to spend time away from the daily grind. John Grisham sites know how to weave a tale!
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|This book was decent. I bought it after reading another one of Giffin's books. I would not run out and buy it off the shelf, but if you like her style of writing, it does not hurt to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its so fun buy it good game u can build so much I love it I don't no what else to say
0062255657|5.0|Great to have a new novel from one of my favourite authors.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Neil Gaiman, or who enjoys a bit of modern fae mythology.  Not for everyone, though, very little explanation with much left up to the imagination (how I like it).  I'm starting to wonder; I feel that the  'Hempstock' name has turned up in every story of his I've read.  Curious.
B004JXXKWY|4.0|Just confirms what I thought, not many people understand Wall street. We sure are suckers. Be better to just burn our money.

B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|I am still trying to come to terms with how good this “Woman child” is.<br />Yes  woman  child; but it  seems like  she was born full grown with the knowledge of a 100 yrs of Jazz..  I can’t use the words raw talent as this would give the impression of a product that is not refined.  She is as refined as they come and the fact that she is in here 20’s is somewhat unnerving.<br /><br />Put it this way, I have never written to an artist’s Face book page or fan club or anything like that in my life, with one exception.  I wrote to Annie Ross of Lambert Hendricks and Ross; when I heard she was not well.  But for Cecil Savant I wrote on her Face book page and sent her a Email.  I could not contain myself. I had  thank her for being a breath of fresh air and not just another pretty voice that would be indistinguishable from any other pretty voice.  Feel free to add her to your collection if you want to have a serious collection of Jazz.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game especially if you like horses. You even get to compete. That's. awesome if you ask me.
B004BSAEQC|5.0|Wondering if the originality will remain in upcoming albums... (Roman Reloaded notsomuch)... This album gives me high hopes for the future of hip hop/female pop.

B00BESJYAY|4.0|Great story about an amazing young man.  So tragic how it all ended later for him.  Good character development. Worth renting
B004QX07G4|4.0|Looking for a good laugh. Good book to read when you need a laugh or two or three or four, etc.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app makes my Kindle Fire HD sound like my Desktop computer - now I don't have to run my amplified speakers at max volume....Thank You! It works great with streaming audio sites.... and you can have it run in the background, so you can surf around and do other things....Well worth the money...
B0082SU98U|5.0|An adorable book. Slightly intriguing and very happy! It has a lesson to be applied to every life, and truly made me \\" just glad\\"
B004GYY714|5.0|I really like this app - besides listening to most of your local stations who provide streaming content...there are tons of other stations that provide streaming music to suit your tastes...and even some utility stations, like news, weather and even some location specific police radio traffic.... Great entertainment app while you're doing other things....it's like satellite radio w/o the monthly charges....all you need is an Internet connection...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game its awesome. The best part of it are the characters. Also I like that you get coins really fast. I love temple run 2222222222222222

B009DZDJU6|4.0|A refreshingly bold historical frankness lifts this biopic out of the ordinary, revealing aspects of the life of the 16th POTUS ordinarily neglected by scholars, who are mostly content to re-hash old controversies and mundane policy issues.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is really fun , this is an type of game we can play whenever free ................. my small brother also plays this and is bonkers about it . So thumbs up for this game
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|challenging and addicting at same time.  if you enjoy logic puzzles and numbers you will enjoy this game and it is worth purchasing.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|What a diverse outstanding career Eric has compiled since starting with the Animals in the early 1960's!  Whatever venue he has choen to pursue (Animals, War, solo) he has never failed to delight. Purchasing his latest offering from Amazon.com I wondered if he could still live up to the standards he has created after all these years?  After one play I had my answer. Now in his seventies he is delivering with a soul that has mellowed and aged like a very robust merlot!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great weather app.  Fast and easy to use. Not much else to say but works well and out is free.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book was so well written and intense. Couldn't put it down. My favorite Nicholas Sparks book! Would recommend for all kinds of readers
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was an amazing book. This book held my interest from the beginning. I started reading this book on a Friday morning while on vacation and was awake until 5am the next morning still reading (I had stopped a few times in between reading) because I could not put the book down. Love the story line and how everything turned out.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  Kept me entertained and really enjoyed the ending as it wasn't what I was expecting.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Both modern popular and traditional, Rod and his accompanying singers do a superb job.  The final song is a unique variation of Alde Lang Syne.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|Was intrigued to the end.  Was  a little long so some of the details were forgotten.  Liked the author's style.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this all the time and don't have at least one problem. I like that it gives you lots of chances to stay in the game if you get hit. Also how it has mystery box, coins to buy stuff, air jet and more it's just awesome!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great app. Had fun so glad there was a hint button. I would pay for it again. I like it. In HD.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I love LinkedIn! It's like a Facebook for real grown-ups. You get to stay connected with co-workers and friends from previous jobs, connect others to new jobs and new connections. I get to keep up on the industry I'm in and causes I'm interested in. Great articles from the top entrepreneurs and CEO's from around the world. Many employer ads are asking to list LinkedIn profiles now. It brings creditability to my experience.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|This was my first Stephen King book, and I started it with high hopes. From the beginning, though, there were serious issues that detracted from my enjoyment of the novel. Jake's motivation to accept his five-year mission is never quite convincing, and the dialog between him and Al feels stilted and unnatural. But at this early stage, I was willing to look past such shortcomings in order to start the adventure.<br /><br />The best parts of the book were the exploration of the past near the beginning, and the scenes in Jodie. Much of the rest was a depressing slog that was not particularly redeemed by clever writing or suspense. I repeatedly found myself wondering why it was necessary to have the character spend five whole years in the past. A lot of it was just spent killing time.<br /><br />The prose had enjoyable moments, but on the whole it was lackluster, and there were editing misses that made me feel like I was reading a ninth-grader's creative writing assignment. For example, the first time we read that the bus to Lewiston comes \\"snoring down the road,\\" I smiled at the metaphor. But the second time the exact expression was used, it felt like a mistake. The third time, I wondered where the editor was.<br /><br />Even worse was the miniature Japanese tape recorder, which is called, without fail, \\"the cunning Japanese tape recorder.\\" Every single time, in those exact words. Okay, Steve. We get it. It's cunning. I was almost shocked when, near the end, Jake finds a bug in a telephone and does not describe it in the same words.<br /><br />The concept of \\"harmony\\" -- the narrator's word for something like synchronicity -- got to be wearisome as well. Characters or places that happen to have a similar name, or which share some other common feature, are constantly seen to be related, sometimes to the point of absurdity. In one scene, there is a sentence that made me laugh out loud. Paraphrasing, it was something like, \\"She lived in a different town, had a different name, looked completely different, and had a different personality, but otherwise she was exactly the same woman.\\" Roll-your-eyes moments like this made it hard to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This book would have been a lot more enjoyable at one third the length. As an example, the final run-in with the bookies and resulting 100-some pages of consequences were just completely unnecessary and tedious. You've already established that the past is obdurate, Steve. This whole sequence felt like filler, and boring filler at that.<br /><br />I give the book two stars rather than one only because I did care about the two primary characters, and there were some enjoyable scenes. I read it to the end mainly because I had invested so much time that I wanted to at least know what the results on the future would be. But if I could go down a rabbit-hole and get those hours back, I don't think I would read it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was such a good game. Very interesting. I can't wait for the new rooms to come. I. would like to see more games like this one. Being free doesn't hurt either.
B007WT135S|5.0|So much has been written over the past five decades about The Rolling Stones - and in particular Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Both are legendary figures in the world of rock'n roll. Mick claims not to remember much, which is why he returned a hefty advance to write his memoirs. Keith? The Stone with the reputation of being the most drug-induced rock star in history and the next predicted victim on every \\"crash and burn\\" list since the 1960's claims to remember it all. And he does a great job of spilling the beans in this very fun book.<br />  He has a lot to say - which is why I read this book twice. It was just as much fun the second time.<br />  Every Stones fan already knows the story. Mick and Keith meet up on a railway station, Brian Jones puts together the band and manager Andrew Loog Oldham lock Mick and Keith in a kitchen until they become songwriters. We know that - but what's so very cool about this book is that you get the true insider's story from Keef himself. This goes for every milestone in the Stones' career, including his insights about all the band members and revolving supporting cast. And he doesn't hold back his thoughts. He makes it very obvious he and Mick have not been attached at the hip for many decades (Mick was reportedly upset about Keith's written jabs at him), he didn't care much for bassist Bill Wyman, he pretty much worships drummer Charlie Watts, and even though this has been referred to in many Stones bios, Keith comes closest to calling Brian Jones an a-hole - and backs it up.<br />  I'll have to admit I learned a lot about drugs through his memories. He doesn't seem to regret any of his addictions and doesn't have the standard cautionary tale of \\"this is your brain on drugs.\\" But he also claims to have been off \\"junk\\" for over 30 years and seems to look back at it as something that was just part of the rock'n roll lifestyle he chose to live during those long ago days.<br />  The ending of the book focuses more on his latest band The X-Pensive Winos and immersing himself in the music of Jamaica.

B00A4A2N6K|3.0|got the whole album. good tracks for when you have people over that are into mainstream hip hop. entertaining and funny.
B005TM12N8|5.0|This is the best album by the Smiths. The production, even before remastering, was fabulous. Johnny Marr's playful skillful riffs accompanying Morrissey's strange quirky lyrics makes the Smiths so great. Love them.
B00E6D4HHO|1.0|Like some fellows pointed here, a new movie is only months away. But the claws are very cool. That's why this gift set should be of \\"The Wolverine\\" only.<br /><br />Lots of people already have all the movies. But would be cool to have this claw. Not worth double (or triple) dipping the whole collection, though.
B009RH9J7W|4.0|Maybe I am just easy to please. This case does exactly what the description said it would do and exactly what I need it to do. Yes, it is a little bulky...but I use an Otterbox with my iPhone, so bulky obviously doesn't bother me.  What IS important to me is that my investment is protected and this case does just that. Now, it's not going to protect it from a rambunctious three-year old, but it does a great job protecting my Kindle from the dangers that lurk inside my purse ensuring that no rogue pens, lip gloss tubes or other bits of detritus scratch the screen.  I love that this case allows me to use my Kindle hands-free, both vertically and horizontally...that goes for me and the Kindle. Other reviewers have mentioned an odd smell.  I have noticed nothing of the sort.  Some reviewers have had issues with their Kindle falling out of the case.  I am not sure how this could happen if they are using the Kindle version for which this case is designed. I literally just shook my case like it was a magic eight ball and my Kindle didn't budge. My only issues with the case have more to do with personal preferences, but the following are what kept me from giving this case five stars.  I have really small hands, so the hand strap is awkwardly placed for me and I don't really use this feature for that reason. Finally, I would love to see some more options in terms of colors and/or patterns.  The color selection is a bit limited.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|The headline says it all.  My six year old said he loves it and that he would not change a thing.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Humble  story / book that brings so many current  counter cultural choices into thought. Provoking the reader to consider their choices about love, family, religion and ethics.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The premise is interesting... a Georgetown Law topper who had stepped out of the workforce to raie a faily, returns to work after her husband is embroiled in scandal.  Each episode includes one main self-contained story plus some themes that run over multiple episodes.  Great concept.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel as well as the author's writing style. She makes you fall in love with the characters even when they are doing things you would like to pick them up and violently shake them for.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game any one can play it its s o much fun if you loose coins jest wait you collect them from your dragons and you can do fun stuff like go to the dragon track breed dragons and even see your friends park if you dont have friends that play you can visit random parks.  Get this game i know you will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
075669812X|4.0|Bought this for my son for Christmas and he loved it. Lots of details on the various characters and great graphics.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Although the first third if the book developed slowly, the story was a fascinating read of survival, courage, and faith.  It was interesting to read about the faith of a Hindu-Christian-Muslim.  I'd guess Pi would be the poster-child for the &#34;Co-exist&#34; bumper sticker crowd.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Decent graphics, good sound, story could use a little spice. And it has puzzles. And a time limit. That limit adds a little stress,but that might be part of the fun.
B00D4E9BDQ|5.0|That is all. Buy it, love it, cherish it, listen to it and you will be forever changed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000W8HC8I|5.0|An incredibly honest and forthright account of a man who gave away the world due to a crippling battle with hubris and addiction. Don't read this as a manifesto on Wall Street or a social analysis of the industry, read it for what it is, a humorous, self-deprecating tale of extreme proportions.
0345529057|5.0|The four books totaled around 4,000 pages.  That appears daunting but I was so engrossed I had to read them all in less than one week.  Great story lines and vividly described.  I will have the fourth book handy as I watch next season's HBO series.
B00DP3IESY|1.0|Horrible movie!  No real plot, few good actors, crappy computer animated graphics and special effects and totally disappointing!  I am so disappointed that I purchased this worthless movie!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so real! Could hardly put it down! Bawled like a baby at parts, but that is only because the characters were so real! Definitely recommend this read!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I did not receive this product at all and I like angry birds.<br />I would consider recommending or not if I had the product.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Although the \\"stories\\" jump in time and place, the individual \\"chapters\\" are amazing. A true look into humanity and societal reaction to chaos. By the middle of the book, you can't put it down.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|The two leads in this show are great, and I really enjoy the supporting cast just as much. This is a light hearted dramedy in the vein of White Collar. If you like that show you will like this one as well. Worth a watch if you are looking for a summer distraction.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Did not measure up to previous books. Not an easy book to read, writing style was difficult to enjoy. Ending was not fully developed.
B004H51706|5.0|We bought this toy for a friend of our son and as soon as he opened it he could not stop playing with it.<br />This car is very well made and has amazing details. The roof string wheel makes it very fun to play with.<br />And for once this is not made in china but In Germany.
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|I will be honest and tell you that I have only met a few other people that have actually enjoyed this movie. But the few who do, are those who understand why life is actually kind of a funny story. The characters are extremely dynamic and immediately you are pulled into a place that you didn't even realize existed. I laughed, I cried, and I learned a lot about myself from this movie. I highly recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't say enough about this book! It's so beautifully written and the story is amazing. It rips your heart out and gives you hope at the same time. I am in awe! Bravo Colleen Hoover!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really would recommend this story in its inspirational vein - just really good!  But have some tissues nearby just in case!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the twists and turns the story is taking and can't wait to watch each new episode.  Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Kind of slow paced; but still FUN!!! My brain isn't as fast as it used to be, I ENJOY it mainly because I don't have to rush!!!

B009ZFPQOQ|1.0|okay. it it totaly different of the usual routing machines. and the idea of making use of the croud that already travels those roads sounds promissing.<br />but WHY making an app that is so difficult? is it just for the sake of making a difference..?<br />this it difficult to be of any use.<br />most apps have a very steap learning curve... here is a horizontal learning &#34;curve&#34; on the zero level...<br />they should do better  to make this app return on my xperia GO
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a very popular app with my daughter but it does take awhile to load up on my Kindle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Plenty to do to care for your own virtual horse. Good graphics, good clean entertainment. My daughter, my son, and I all enjoy it.

B0080Z5IB8|4.0|I first heard about House of Leaves during a group discussion on Goodreads about 'strange' books.  Someone told me House of Leaves was a freaky wierd book that scared the hell out of her, so I was instantly interested, and ordered a copy a few weeks later.<br /><br />The first thing that I thought when I opened the mail was 'oh shit, what I have I gotten myself into?' because even though I read my fair share of big books, this one is HUGE.  700+ pages may not sound like that many, but it's the size of a city phone book.  I was tempted just to tuck it into the bookshelves with every intention of reading it 'one day', until peer pressure got to me, so I sat down one Sunday afternoon and started reading.<br /><br />This book is everything - it's horrible, fantastic, boring, exciting, intriguing and frustrating all at once - there are times that I couldn't stop reading, and times when I wanted to throw it against the wall.  It's disjointed yet coherent, intriguing yet bland and in the end, I enjoyed it much more than I did during some parts of reading it.  And considering that this is Mr. Danielewski's debut novel, it's certainly an epic undertaking that is pretty flawlessly executed.<br /><br />I didn't find it particularly scary, although some of the things that the characters experience is enough to make you crack out the measuring tape, and the mental health of Johnny Truant who puts together the book itself is more than questionable, it was mostly the range of emotions that I went through when reading it that will really stick with me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a really good book. Definitely one of my favorites.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes edge-of-your-seat action.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|Stephen Sills is a folk and rock and roll legend. His songs define the lives and loves of an entire generation. This four CD set that covers his entire portfolio of songs, in their original studio versions, on stage and a wealth of bootlegged cuts as well will bring you back to a time that changed the world. Worth every cent I paid for it, we listen to it in the car on long trips, as well as around the house when no other music will do.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|The images start off hypnotically beautiful, and I thought the entire film would continue in this manner. But as the film progresses, you see the artistic commentary about life and humanity. We see people in slums picking through garbage, factory farming, and assembly lines. The images all remain perfectly filmed, but you have to start thinking about what the images mean to you.<br /><br />I loved the recurring images of human faces with a focus on the eyes. I could have done without the &#34;man at his desk rubbing clay on his face&#34;.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|If you want to leave the real world and not have to think about the movie this one is for you.
B0057UA486|4.0|If there is a classification that fits this movie it would have to be tragedy.  Great story line following the life and exploits of Redman Barry.  Great cinematography and acting.  You get a glimpse of how life was back in the days of chivalry and duels.
B007STBUIW|5.0|The film of Jaws came out when I was young, but I saw it many times on cable and rented the film. It is a great film because of the story, the characters and the actors and actresses that make the film happen.<br /><br />This blue ray edition had included content, one of which was the making of Jaws. This was utterly fascinating. I had heard the story about how &#34;the shark is working!&#34; was a battlecry on set, but this making of talks about that and so much, much more. I highly recommend watching the making of, just to gain an appreciation for what making this film entailed, and the naïve director of Steven Spielberg at the time.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love the new mpoints but the app itself is a little slow and glitchy. Forces close a lot and I can never get it to show me the alerts without it forcing close.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This disc showed up as a recommendation from Amazon. Thank you!<br /><br />I read the reviews of the disc and they were very favorable, talking about how Joe Banamassa is one of the best blues guitarists in the world. I decided to pull the trigger and buy the disc, and got the free Amazon mp3s as a bonus. That gave me the opportunity to listen before I got the disc delivered.<br /><br />Please note that I am a sucker for both live music, which this is, and acoustic music, which this also is. I admit, my initial reaction was disappointment because the first several songs are not what I call blues. But then I started listening to the music, and as it went on I realized several things.<br /><br />1) Joe Banamassa is a damn good guitar player. That's the beauty of acoustic, its much more difficult to hide bad playing compared to electric music.<br /><br />2) This CD is not a blues CD to me, but more a musical journey through the mind of Joe when this was performed and recorded. It has bluegrass, folk, blues, ballads - a wonderful mix of songs with a range of musical styles.<br /><br />3) As I listened the first time, I grew to appreciate what I was listening to versus what I was expecting to hear. This appreciation only increased as I listened to the concert more, each time it just moves me.<br /><br />4) In general, I am a fan of the female voice in music due to the range they can achieve and generally sounding better, in my opinion. This concert, Joe's singing is excellent. It just seems appropriate to the songs he plays, in terms of his harshness or subtly.<br /><br />This is a very special concert. Joe Banamassa has a convert in me. I will need to search for other offerings by this very talented musician.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|saw Woodstock back when it came out and was excited to find this 2 disc set. good quality and saw a lot of things I had forgotten. enjoyed it
B004LLDN3A|5.0|This movie is a classic.  I remember watching this movie as a kid.  It is a good wholesome movie and I am glad my kids enjoyed watching it.
B00821PCJS|3.0|Good actors, my problem was it was on my prime account and when I had time to return to it they wanted to charge me for the program.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies.  Nicolas plays an alcoholic well and elizabeth shue is very attractive.  great movie
B003F3NDP8|5.0|This was and still is my favorite show of all time and season 6 was my favorite season of all because it had the best guest stars on there such as Drea de Mateo from the Sopranoes who did an amazing job as Angie Bolen who was a strong,tough character and Josh Zuckerman from the movie sexdrive did an even more amazing job as Eddie Orlofski which was my personal favorite storyline. I couldn't help but to feel for him in spite of the awful things he has done but it was his mothers fault for making him turn out the way that he did and Diane Farr did an amazing job playing his drunken,evil mother!
B0063M22QO|4.0|easy and fast, but absorbing and diverting.  Enjoyable when only have a short span of time that needs filled or passed.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The kids loved it!  They wanted to watch it over and over again. I highly recommend this movie for purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. College Hoover is officially one of my favorite authors. I will definitely be reading this again!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Wow, I could not put this book down!<br />The story is well written, and it says something about a parents love for a child, no matter how bad the child is......?!
B000S88JTS|5.0|I don't own this movie at the moment, and I probably won't order it because I'd rather get it on bluray if it ever comes out. But I used to watch this movie all the time with my father when I was a kid. My dad is a life-long motorcycle lover and he loves this move very much. It was a bit of a father-son bonding thing, watching this movie together was.<br /><br />I used to ride my bicycle and pretend to be my favorite racers from the movie. It's one of my most fondly remembered movies.<br /><br />If you like \\"Endless Summer\\" I'm sure you would like this one, they are both filmed in a very similar way, the narration is written the same and it has the same general feel. The premise of the movie is to just show all the different kinds of motorcycle racing that is going on around the world at any given time, On Any Sunday. It shows the different styles and presents them in a way that makes it feel very relaxing and pass-timey. The movie really makes you want to go grab a motorcycle and go for a nice, stress free, relaxing ride on a lazy Sunday. The social aspect is of course presented (the same as with Endless Summer) where you really get a feel like these guys live for Sunday, when they can leave the worries of life behind, and just go riding with their best friends.<br /><br />Some of the people in the movie are weekend warriors, others are professionals, but you can clearly see that they all share the same love and passion for the sport.<br /><br />Even if I never actually get around to buying it and having it on my dvd rack (I've seen it about a million times over my life, so I don't feel an urgent need to own it right now) It will always hold a special place in my heart and being a bonding film with my father.<br /><br />If you are a father who likes bikes, and want to share something cool with your son, or even if you just want to watch a cool movie about bikes, you really cannot go wrong with Bruce Brown's \\"On Any Sunday\\"
1452110581|5.0|A friend gave me this book and every tine I'm feeling low, I just open to a poem and read it aloud.  I bought this copy for my mom and I have lent out my copy to quite a few friends.  It's sublimely funny!

B00B2TUKI0|5.0|If you like female jazz/blues vocalists you can't go wrong with Madeleine Peroux.  She very well carries on in the vein of Billy Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Thriller from the page to the last one. Had a hard time putting it down; but I wish Amy had gotten what she deserved.
030758836X|3.0|I began reading this book hoping the foul language would drop off, by the time I realized it wasn't I was involved in the book. The language used in this book is a sad commentary of our times. I have recommended my friends. NOT read this book simply due to the language that was completely unnecessary.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It's a good book, but like many others, I'm disappointed that some of my favorite characters were not in it and I had to wait 1000 more pages to see them again.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Best Stephen King novel in a quite some time.  Very well written!  This novel was very difficult to put down.
0307352153|5.0|If you're wondering what to do about your introverted child or the introverted you ... do nothing. Susan Cain shares her insight into why you're fine, just the way you are.<br />This is an an important book and should be required reading for all parents, care givers, teachers, coaches and bosses. Classrooms could be revolutionized if even half of the information shared in these pages was acted on by caring involved teachers. The daily fate of their introverted pupils would be quite different.<br />The word \\"power\\" in the subtitle says it all. In a world that respects extroverts, your quiet is puzzling and many perceive you as powerless. With the multied and varied means by which extroverts can tell their story, it means they don't ever have to be quiet  .... what with Facebook, Blogs, Twitter, Texting and the many social media means of interactions. For these talkers with so much to say, oftentimes about nothing, it is quite beyond them why anyone would choose to stay quiet.<br />Much of this book resonated strongly with me as the mother of an introvert. I am guilty of trying to get him to change, constantly presenting all of the shoulds, should nots and musts for him to have a successful day. His progressive private school applied similar pressure and I found myself very saddened at the many mistakes this book brings back to me that I made. Written from the heart with such respect, first person honesty and delightful insight, this intriguing, intelligent, enlightening book makes me wish I could go back and do some things differently, but it's never too late to learn. It has transformed my thinking and outlook about \\"quiet\\" people especially children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best escape apps ever. Not to hard not too easy, but just right. I love finding all the hidden clues then solving puzzles. I highly recommend this fun filled app !! :)

B005D9MUWY|5.0|The more you use it, the better it gets. It really does what it claims. There are still some auto correct fails that occur, but that is to be expected. It's still better than any keyboard for Android that I've tried.

B00DGNO3WE|3.0|You have to have an appreciation of opera to follow this movie. I liked the senior actors banter back and forth.
1452126577|1.0|This wasn't what I was expecting. Silly games and word puzzles with obvious answers? I would have enjoyed a \\"parallel lives\\" book about grumpy cat and Tarder Sauce, or a travelogue of all the places Tarder Sauce and Tabby have gone, perhaps with some information about all the rescue cat places that have benefited from their appearances. Where is the castle? Out of the dozen or so pictures of Tarder Sauce, most were photo-shopped out of their original environment and completely uninteresting.  I won't pre-order any Grumpy cat books in the future, but wait for some reviews first.  I love Grumpy Cat as Tarder Sauce's alter ego, but this book was just misanthropic with no redeeming value.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, good suspense and I enjoyed it.  I just didn't care for the ending, but that is personal opinion.  Worth reading, get it.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I am a big fan of the camel club series, and this newest in the series did nothing to disappoint.

B00AW57L96|5.0|Cecilia Fitzpatrick thinks she knows her husband inside out, so she's surprised to accidentally discover in the attic a dusty sealed envelope with \\"For my wife - to be opened only in the event of my death\\" written on it in his handwriting.  When she casually mentions it to him on the phone, his reaction makes it clear that the last thing he wants is for her to open that envelope - but why?<br /><br />Leaving us with this intriguing puzzle, the story then jumps to another woman, Tess, whose husband has fallen in love with someone else.  Shocked and distraught, Tess makes immediate plans to go and stay with her mother in Sydney, taking her young son with her.  Then we move onto a third woman, Rachel, whose much loved daughter died many years previously and whose life now centres on her grandson.  Shortly, the three women's lives will intersect and the secret that Cecilia's husband has been guarding for so long will impact on them all.<br /><br />Despite strong word of mouth, I wasn't expecting a lot from this book, having once tried to read another by this Australian author and giving up on it.  But I absolutely devoured The Husband's Secret.  From the first chapter I was gripped and I read it in two settings.  I worried about the characters - I even woke up in the middle of the night wondering how the author could possibly resolve the events that she'd set in motion.  This isn't epic literature, but it's incredibly readable and totally gripping - the kind of book you want for a long plane flight.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is so much better than Minecraft Pocket Edition Lite! My brother has it, and it barely has anything! I love the regular version.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Entertaining and engaging -- Bruce Willis plays the tough guy with a soft inside again.  The story was a nice romp with a little romance to spice it up.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really entertaining game overall.  Would like to see an easier way to navigate from location to location, but it kept you moving, and it was riveting and fun.  The puzzles and hidden object searches were great. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B003B02O14|3.0|I have read a number of Grisham's novel and I found this book was not up to his normal standards.  Usually, I find his stories<br />informative as well as entertaining.  The Partner was trite, sophomoric and almost boring.  Even the characters were not particularly interesting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so unique! It was sexy and hilarious and I loved being in the guys head for the whole book! Very different from anything I've ever read!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I had a hard time putting this last book down. When you get so far in this series you want some closure on story lines, but this one keeps you guessing and saying \\"No! They can't kill him!\\"<br />I think Mr. Martin likes to keep his options open for more book to come. I know I'd like to read more!l
B006FE83UE|5.0|Excellent! Wonderful special features, and lovely redone visuals. Got it as a present for my Mother and she has greatly enjoyed it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This. Game. Is. Awesome. If you loved the movie you will love this action packed fun lovable game!! So go ahead and be #1 one minion of the year!!!
B005URRCUY|5.0|a bit more dancing that the others previous discs but it's a bunch of fun. I enjoyed it very much<br /><br />very recomendable!!
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, more for the acting and the production values.  It was a tightly knit movie that delivered more than I expected.  The concept is a variation on a theme that has been done before.  The director pulled this one off, it is worth watching.
0062082353|5.0|I am not good at finishing books, BUT this book was one that I could not put down. In fact I couldn't wait to go back to reading it. I highly recommend this book. Chris Kyle is a true American Hero and gives great insight into the unfortunate bull crap and bureaucracy that plagues our military and the protection of our soldiers serving.
B00004U5SC|5.0|Shane was kept out of the box offices for a whole year so it wouldn't have to compete with other Westerns that were released that year.  When it hit the movie theaters in 1953? 1954? It was a smash hit.  I love to watch it about every 2 to 3 years. you'll Love it too.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Sure enjoyed the app as it was before all the  changes. Don't need all the pretty flowers, just obviously got too many people sitting around trying to trick it out.  How about tide tables?  Do you even respons Ron our reviews?
B00BUADSMQ|4.0|Great action movie, typical Bruce Willis with lots of action and wild things going on! IF you enjoy action then you will enjoy this movie
B0049J0CTM|2.0|I rented Finding Nemo so I could play it on a loop on my desktop for my baby until the rental time expired. Unfortunately the video stopped playing after 10minutes and was \\"loading\\" for another 10. I closed it then reopened but then the video couldn't even be found. Sigh
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|If you are a fan of Gaiman you will love it.  It is a quick read and very reminiscent of Coraline.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you pick it up, it will be impossible to put down! Can't wait to read the next! Enjoy everyone!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Have L.O.V.E.D. Azada for years. T he puzzles are not too difficult yet are challenging enough to stay F.U.N! Big fish games never disapoint
0596522347|5.0|Five years after its release, I finally got around to reading Slide:ology. I wish I hadn't waited so long.<br /><br />This book will serve as a must-have reference for many years. Although Duarte's book is ostensibly about slide creation, its applications are much, much broader. Her book serves as a design primer for those of us who never studied design - but I really appreciated that instead of being a \\"Design for Dummies\\" course, it was a smart introduction that respected the reader's intelligence.<br /><br />There are two sections I'll use repeatedly. First, Duarte features 12 pages with more than 100 sample diagrams. Those diagrams venture far from the most obvious ones, and offer most presenters a lifetime worth of great ideas. Second, I appreciated her explanation of color selection. I've been selecting colors by instinct for years, but after reading that section, I realized I have some important edits to make.<br /><br />As a professional presenter for more than a decade, I'm not an easy audience - I've given a lot of thought to the appearance of my company's slides and have read a fair bit about this topic. Duarte vastly exceeded my expectations; I picked up nugget after nugget throughout her book.<br /><br />Her book complements Garr Reynolds' Presentation Zen nicely, particularly because they both covered common ground from two different perspectives.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|Bought this just to have live rendition of 'Hallelujah'. Turns out the whole collection is wonderful. My only regret was that I was not at the live concert. So well done including the contribution of his entourage of backup vocals and instrumentation. Really rocks the Mach stereo in my old Ford Taurus. Any excuse to go for a ride. The more I play this 2 CD set of this great live London concert the more I love it. Full concert sound. Electronic keyboards, Harmonica, Clarinet, Sax, Pedal steel and electric guitars, Hammond organ, and more? Enjoy!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Could not put in down. loved the book. I think a movie came out, but i love his books as I do this one.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Got the box set to give as a gift. The show itself is awesome hence my desire to share it and so far I haven't heard any complaints about anything missing or not working.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't understand the hype around this book. It was poorly written. Feels like a teenager wrote this book. I will not recommend this book to my friends.
B001AR4K8K|5.0|Love this movie and practically have the entire script memorized- good DVD, plays great, no complaints! Would recommend this flick to almost anyone who's into vamps and/or horror-comedy.
0439023491|5.0|i love this book and now that i am done am looking to sell it. i am glad i went with buying oline at a great price
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I'm a total sucker for vampires and this show is a mix of Twilight and True Blood. Got this box set for a friend as a gift, no complaints on box or discs.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I like bubble games and this one is likable. It's challenging to try to get that 1st star with a limited number of balls. The frustration comes in when u start losing lives or drop all the balls n haven't earned a star. Great way to waste time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy escape games but readily admit that I am not the best at them. This game is challenging enough but doesn't get me so stuck that it's frustrating instead of fun. I am playing the free version and the ads are not bothersome. So far I haven't had the issues that some others have been complaining about with Kindle Fire use. All in all I am really liking this game!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very addictive. Very fun. Spend hours playing. Love the colors and comparisons to movie.  Good for all ages. Love this game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This big is way to long but it is good!<br />This book has a lot of action<br />Awesome! long! action!
B0063M22QO|4.0|THIS Game keep your mind at ease.Very relaxing.it wake my brain up<br />All way thanks I will keep on playing
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A great simple read that is packed with anecdotes that remind us how to take care of our selves in deeper ways. It's not a justification book for narcissists however. Often taking care of ourselves involves taking better care for others by honoring ourselves first, and understanding honesty more deeply.<br /><br />Great read, simple and straightforward.  I'd recommend it gladly.  I read it on Kindle at the gym.
B008EKOO46|5.0|Jared Diamond again takes us on an incredible intellectual journey from the simplistic fiction of the 'noble savage' to a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the forces that shaped human minds and humanity.
0670019933|5.0|I found this book to be significantly more enjoyable than the original scroll of On The Road, which I also considered to be a great book. This work contains Kerouac's world view through Buddhism, a very significant part of his life that On The Road lacked. I also preferred Japhy over Neal (Dean), whose eccentricities and beautiful thoughts really tied the book together. As someone who's very interested in Buddhism, I may be biased, but I feel strongly that this is the superior work. It's also a very manageable length. This is definitely one of my favorite novels. I would suggest this to anyone, especially those who have a taste for freedom or are interested by the curious paradox of American Buddhism.
B0057VY45O|5.0|I was looking for a show that I would continue to watch. I tried at least 10 different shows of different genres but with highest reviews (critical and audience). This was the show that hit the spot for me. The other ones concentrate on grabbing attention with too much violence and sex and they often tend to overshadow the other qualities. Yet, this show had a high self-esteem. Almost everything I look for in a show was there in terms of character development, tension, professional insight, and witty lines.  The first season was also far better than the second, so will have to see about the third.
034544678X|5.0|Even though I have had dogs most of my life, I found lots to learn and try to apply in this book.  After the death of our beloved dog in January my husband and I are on a search for another rescue dog. We're both reading this book and keeping it on hand in anticipation. I bought 2, one to share with friends.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I had solved all the levels of the first 2 versions of Quell and hadn't played quell in quite some time. Then when my grandchildren were here for the weekend they asked me if they could play it. That was when I discovered there was a 3rd version and now I am hooked AGAIN.<br /><br />THANKS ... Barb
B00634GHJA|5.0|The thing about this app is that there a few pieces to the puzzle that must be placed in order for it to work. (dialogue boxes, etc.) But the software designer's clear instructions make this app easy to use shortly after installation. Nice job.
B0011TMGKG|5.0|i have purchased many of the lamaze play and grow animals and my grand triplets love them but i find the lion especially collects a lot of fuzz and dirt and looks dirty
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is not just another SEAL Team Six story! This is a story about one man' fearless effort to overcome every adversity he is faced with. This story about the human side of a true American Hero!
B009LRE040|5.0|I would recommend this product to all.<br />I loved how it was action packed<br />It was a classic batman movie!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|So, far it's not as cool as I hoped. Still waiting for the iPhone app. Interesting concepts. But I feel duped by hearing free NetFlix and then hearing that Google pulled the offer due to the success. #fail
B006LR0XLM|5.0|its great i love it i have recomended it to all my family and friends it is so easy to share files photos or vidios i am fairly new to it but love the way it updates all the computers im working on
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. Love the fact that my granson &amp; I can both play. Don't have to worry about content. Not as easy as it looks. Very addictive! Love it!!!!!
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It is really convenient to have an app right at your finger tips for one of your favorite shopping destinations!
B002361MLA|5.0|I have read numerous books on spirituality. This particular book has been the most straight forward, get to the meat of it book that I have read so far. The teachings have to be practiced every day all the time. You have to be in the NOW! This book is my new bible, and I have ordered more copies to hand out to friends and family. After reading this book it has taken a tremendous load off my shoulders.
B007WPM7SO|4.0|I'm addicted to English period pieces and brutal love stories.  Great acting, beautifully filmed.  Reminder of how brutal war is.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't care what any body says . I love it; it is so entertaining and fun to do I love it
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I was wrong. If you like marathon viewing, this series is really good.  I don't know if I will purchase a season again. It's unlikely I will watch it often enough to justify the expense.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|The script is fairly light. The topic is very intricate and interesting,I hope not true.<br />I liked most of the acting very much the parts. As for the script hard to imagine that one<br />man could fiqure out the whole crime set up in days.....well.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really looking forward to Season 4 to see how Carl's character continues to change as he grows up. the actor playing Carl is very convincing.
B00BLYFDO2|3.0|I too miss Ron Asheton and his particular brand of in your face proto punk. But I love Raw Power and James Williamson was a huge part of that sound. So James has added his sonic personality and Ready To Die is a much different album for it. It's a more produced, lush and mellow album, being much closer to Raw Power or Kill City than the original Stooges sound. That's OK so long as you're not expecting Fun House. Admittedly I much prefer the sonic grind of the Weirdness. Ron Asheton's guitar was raw, overdriven and psychedelic and more in keeping with the spirit of the Stooges first two albums. Ballads on a Stooges album takes a little getting used to. I like it, you may not depending on expectations.<br /><br />The real star of the show is Iggy himself. Unlike the Weirdness Ig sings in key, and the songs are written in his range so he's not straining. He sounds strong and confident and fits well within the music. On the Weirdness the vocals and band never gelled and often sounded as though they were fighting one another. The fault was not entirely Iggy's, I blame producer Steve Albini for that particular weakness. He's a one trick pony in terms of production and his particular style may work for some, but not Iggy Pop. If anything he threw Iggy's shortcommings into sharp relief. In contrast Iggy sounds much better on Ready To Die and lyrically Ig doesn't embarrass himself quite as much as on The Weirdness. Well DD's is wretched, being an junior highschool homage to mammary glands. But in general one can ignore the lyrics for most of these songs if one cares to with no loss of enjoyment. And if one listens a more mature outlook is presented that is very unlike the Weirdness. Let's face it The Weirdness had some of the worst lyrics of Iggy's career and sounded as though they were made up five minutes prior to recording the songs.<br /><br />Ultimately though I can't unreservedly recommend this album. It's a little too slick, a little too mellow, and unfortunately a little bland. I'm afraid that this album just doesn't provide that sonic blast that I expect from the Stooges. It's an improvement in some regards over The Weirdness but is a lot closer to an Iggy solo album than a Stooges one and perhaps should have been marketed as one.ttle bland. I'm afraid that this album just doesn't provide that sonic blast that I expect from the Stooges.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Haven't watched it yet.  Only up to the end of Season 2 and can't stop watching it.  I know Season 3 will be perfect too.  Love the Series.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Ben Howard's music and lyrics are some of the most beautiful I've ever experienced... music for the soul. I could listed to this all day.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great characters. Vivid and original interpretation of a haunting dystopian future. I would recommend this saga to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, political commentary, and/or a sweet love story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved how the characters grew on me and the writing style was very welcoming. I did get tired of the sex stuff but beauty of it was their relationship took Christian to a new level.<br />I enjoyed it and kind of am bummed that I've finished all three.
B0026SERTY|5.0|Very good movie, and the streaming quality was great!  Amazon makes it easy to rent and play the movie. Thanks
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I played this game for about 5 minutes, never stopped vibrating. Please fix this and I will give a better review
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app is easy to use and works.  I especially like the feature that requires you to solve a math problem before turning off the alarm.  It pretty much ensures you don't go back to sleep.  The gradually increasing volume of the wake-up tone is also a nice feature.  This is the only alarm I use now.
B007SGM084|5.0|Amazing series and a must read! Glad i heard of these books. i rarely read, but could not put this one down.this author has amazing talent.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Great collection of songs.  There is no other singer like Celine Dion.  No one can match her range.  Especially in French.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really gets your brain juices flowing!  Fun, challenging, yet easy also.  Great game!  I purchased a few other apps like this to try as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game!!! Teaches you how to take care of a horse, clean the paddock, and keeping the horse healthy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great. It is worth playing just for the noises the minions make while running. Pretty much the same game as Temple Run.
B003XVYLDU|2.0|Kurt did some serious drugs while writing this. If Aliens, war, weird sex references are your thing, pick up this classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game since the first day I got the Kindle Fire HD High Definition 8.9 on my birthday in April 2. So I got my Kindle Fire at Best Buy. So, I was so happy when I got it, my Mom said it costed $360.34, And I said, &quot;Say what?! I thought it costed like $200.00!&quot; So I was really surprised how much it cost! But thankfully, my Mom had enough money on her Credit Card. So, when we got the Kindle Fire, 2 more things I needed for my Kindle, and that was:<br />1:Screen Protector<br />2: A case for my Kindle Fire<br />So, I got those, and it almost costed about $400.00. o_o. So, a man was explaining how to download games an  other stuff, and he downloaded 2 games which was:<br />1: Mine craft<br />2: Fruit Ninja<br />So, he explained other stuff, and when he was done, we went out of Best Buy, went in the car, and I went straight to play Minecraft. So you see, I was really excited to play this game, and my Mom was like, &quot;What is that are you playing?&quot; And I said, &quot;I am playing Minecraft&quot;. So she was like, &quot;What the heck is that?&quot; So I laughed. And many Months later, I am still playing this game! It is totally worth the $6.99, so I highly recommend you this game. I have more games then before, like, I don't know how many games I actually have, but it is really a lot. Lol. I will write more reviews, and I am only Black, and I am 9 years-old. I write really long reviews, and I hope you like this review, and I hope it's good for you to understand, You might laugh that I am a bit funny, because I like giving people jokes. Hehe. So, the next time I give a review, look for my name Charlemagne, but it's really not my name, my name is Sarah. Bye now, Have a nice day! :).<br />~Love Sarah~
0857860801|5.0|If you looking at this book you probably know about Simons cat. That being said imagine my elation when I open my hard cover book to see the author and creative genius Simon Tofields signature on the front page. The hubbs got this as a birthday gift for me and he claims he did know or special order a signed copy. I have to write him at once and thank him for signing my book. Do not hesitate. Buy this book. IDK if your copy will come signed like mine but it is sooooo delightful anyways. I recommend this book for all ages. Enjoy.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I grew up watching The Doctor’s of old and “discovered” the newer series right about the time that these specials were coming out.  My husband and I quickly brought ourselves up to speed on the new series and got our children hooked.  The wait to get this set from the library was too long for our impatient family and finding a good price on the DT specials here on Amazon was the key.<br /><br />BBC original DVDs, excellent quality, and not just the specials themselves but the Doctor Who Confidentials that were aired as companions to the specials – I was so happy to get these and we still watch them regularly.<br /><br />Plus - David Tennant was an excellent Doctor - could watch his series' all day.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|If you like puzzlers, it doesn't get much better. Great variety, and perfect for passing time. Excellent for tablet users. 5 stars!
B00000JPH6|2.0|While the puppeteering was flawless, everything else was too awful for words. Wondrous puppets and scenery just aren't enough against, snail pacing, confusing plot, and unappealing characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really love this game. Both enjoyable for me and my kids. Great graphics. Very addictive.<br />Also great that it was free.<br />I would recommend it to everyone.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|This prequel to the long running series based on the late Robert Parker's creation was both well written and acted. Not to belabor what others have noted,  Ms. Viola Davis' work in the earlier stories is truly missed.  Mr. Selleck's performance is credible, and true to the original character personality as expounded in print.  True classics indicative of what can be put together when the collaborators are of the highest caliber.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|One of the best and most difficult hidden object series in  this game.  The navigation is clear along with hints. My only negative is that it took a long time to download on my Kind Fire.
B005PK57NU|5.0|All I want is more The Good Wife. Best show available on Amazon Prime, after Downton Abbey! Juliana Marguiles is incredible as usual, and this season leaves you wanting season 4 right away (so let's go ahead and add it, ok, Amazon/CBS??)
0920668372|5.0|I gave this book a 5-Star rating because I have children and this book has been the closest example of a parent's love for their child(ren)!
0061122416|5.0|This book got me to thinking about life.I think its a good book.Good life lessons.It was just what I needed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|there are so many breeds of dragons in this game from common to ultra rare . im exicted for the updated version to come up so i can make crafted dragons. you can also invite me as a neighbor,. my storm id is draqella
B009GXHOW4|4.0|This is a great app for minecraft but someone please post in the comments how to use this app it won't add items into my inventory
B004WKI204|4.0|I cannot write nearly as well as Tina Fey. All I will say is that this is a great book with some real life lessons for everyone.<br /><br />Buy it and enjoy...
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Sentimental? Yes. But it is sprinkled with words of wisdom we can all use from time to time. Loved it.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Please send me the actual game and then I can review the help guide.  Tried to order this game several times, but cannot figure why the order doesn't go through.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This was a great book;I couldn't put it down. It's definitely not light reading, though; the graphic inhumanity to man portrayed in the book is critical to the story but makes it tough to read at times.
0743243153|5.0|The Road Less Traveled is one of the better how to live your life books. It follows the new, positive psychology rather than the grim Freudian dictates. I especially like Dr. Peck's emphasis on holistic living—emphasizing that mental  and spiritual growth should happen concurrently. Another part which resonated with me was his distinction between love and dependency, and how two people who marry should go into the marriage as two distinct human beings. Also, people who truly love each other will care for the other's spiritual growth. What a great maxim to live by!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|If you like a book that causes you to lose sleep you must read Room.  The compelling characters of Ma and Jack had me hooked right away.  The book is told from 5 year old Jack`s point of view.  I love how fully the author captured the mother child relationship.  This book is truly an enjoyable, thought provoking read.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I love this app. I can now record video on my kindle fire and easily access the camera. I have used it a few times and it is great. Now kindle just needs to add a back camera and it would be WONDERFUL
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I love Harvey & Mike, and Jessica!.  It is a fantastic show!  I can't believe the ending. I can't wait for season 3 to come out
0399255370|4.0|My three-year-old daughter Magda loved this book so much that she can't wait to start school just so she can bring it with her to show her teacher. It's about a boy named Duncan who has an unexpected discovery one day at school. His crayons have all written him letters of complaint! Grey crayon is tired of colouring in all those large animals--elephants hippos, whales; Black crayon is tired of only being used to outline other colours; Blue crayon is just plain tired; Green crayon is happy enough but he'd like to intervene on behalf of his friends, Orange and Yellow, who are currently not speaking to each other as each claims to be the true colour of the sun; and Pink and Beige feel frankly ignored. How will Duncan appease them all?<br /><br />Magda loved this book because she found it funny to think of her crayons as having opinions and complaints. Of course, I've heard her arguing with her Lambie on more than one occasion, so maybe she didn't find it so hard to believe after all.<br /><br />I liked it because it's funny and clever, it encourages children to be creative with how they use their crayons (why not draw an orange whale or a yellow sky?) AND it's illustrated by the marvellous Oliver Jeffers (author/illustrator of The Incredible Book Eating Boy).<br /><br />You can see more of Oliver Jeffers in his video, \\"Oliver Jeffers, Picture Book Maker\\" on my blog, Cozy Little Book Journal.<br /><br />Source Disclaimer: I received a review copy directly from the publisher (thank-you!), but this did not influence the content of my review in any way. All opinions expressed are strictly my own (with a little help from my daughter of course).
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game itself is fun, but the pause in between each run takes forever to load. And if you want to complete the missions, then you need a facebook or you need tokens. It also is very rare that you collect the tokens during the run. The only way you can get tokens for free is to hack into the computer system to say you did something.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a great story. I have truly enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading it and the rest of the series multiple times.
B008GATNNG|5.0|Delivery time a little longer than expected.<br />Purchased as a gift.<br />CD2 is the best, love entire collection<br /><br />Rusty Campers
B00CATSONE|3.0|It's a good intro to the man and some of his innovations / inventions and adventures with the bad boys of banking & financing.  Could have gone into more depth.  Was also interesting the learn about the antics of Edison and other leading edge personalities of the era.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I LOVE THIS SERIES!  I CAN'T WAIT TO OBTAIN SEASON 4. BRITISH SERIES ARE EXCELLENT.<br />GREAT ACTORS AND STORIES WITH NO OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE..
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Would have given the game 4.5 stars but the fact that each run is different from the start shows someone really put some thought and effort into the game's creation. Additional compliments for the vantage variations.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|This game is both awesome and addicting! I start playing it and can't stop until I get at least one More achievement.
B008476HBM|5.0|There is no doubt it is a time tested classic. Authors today do not share the same writing style. However I must add in order to put the details into this story it is quite long.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I have been a survivalist since 1961 any movie which touches on this I love the first movie was panic in the year 0
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun. I can play this game for hours. Very challenging. The minions are cool and l like their remotes.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|If you have a Roku, AppleTV, game machine, connected smart TV, or computer hooked up to your TV then you have very limited uses for the ChromeCast. If you are new to the ipTV world then RokuLT @ $49 gives you more options (it is also easier to setup) and does not require a second connected device to be with you. If you always have a connected device then ChromeCast it worth it and will (someday) provide more options.<br /><br />Only 2  good reasons to get it:<br />1. If you got the 3 months of Netflix then it is a no brainer to try this out otherwise wait until version 2.<br />2. If you use two HD computer screens for work (I do) putting it in one will allow you to watch an online \\"instructional\\" video on one screen and take notes on the other.<br /><br />Unlike the Roku, AppleTV, and/or computer setup Chromecast does not support DLNA. Considering I have a number of DVDs and all my music on a NAS server, the NAS information is just about useless with a ChromeCast.
0920668372|5.0|I got this book. At my baby shower in 07 and now i buy it for friends and family who. Are having little boys
1406830488|5.0|Buy this book , if you have any sense , you will not regret it<br />I mean it . buy it now , or borrow it .
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works seemlessly, had it up and running in about 5 minutes. I was surprised that it comes with an HDMI extender, which I actually ended up needing to use. You do need a decent wifi signal, but it works exactly as advertised. At 35 a pop, this is a great deal even without the free netflix. Developers are going to be onboard soon, and we should its potential soon enough. Go for it!
B00026WU3M|5.0|Bob Dylan proves once again, that he is one of greatest poets of our time.  Lots of harmonica, too!  A must-have for any Dylan fan!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Can't essentially playing even though I have had to restart.  The kindle updates are likely to cause the app to crash.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Historical fiction isn't typically my top choice in genre.  So, when the book club chose this book, I wasn't overly thrilled.  However, I read the description and thought it sounded like it might be interesting.  To my surprise and delight, I was hooked from the start!<br /><br />The Orphan Train is a moving narrative which tells the story of 91 year old Vivian and 17 year old foster child Molly in present day Maine, who, because of circumstances and then discovered commonalities, forge a kindred friendship.  I was engrossed in the story of Vivian and what she had gone through as a child.  I had never heard of this part of history and am both appalled and inspired by the thousands of children who went through similar experiences.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I would have liked to be more involved in Molly's story.  The author did a fabulous job of intertwining the stories of the two women and really made me feel apart of Vivian's story, but fell short on Molly's life.<br /><br />I would (and have) recommend this book to a friend.

B00CSKQ5IG|2.0|This review is a comparison review for the 2013 blu-ray vs the 2008 blu-ray release.<br />Only two things I noticed that were new in this 2013 release of Terminator 3 and and the 2008 release. The disc itself has a new plain black label, and a new upc bar-code and coupon that expires in August 2013 were added to the outer wrapper. The description of this release on the Amazon page is inaccurate. The movie is listed as 118 minutes, but the cover of the blu-ray says it's 109 minutes long, as it actually is. It is the same exact film. I ONLY bought this because the Amazon description said it had a longer running time, and it had no image for me to refer to in order to double check. I would advise people to not be fooled by the description and buy either version you can get.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Like farmville on Facebook but even better because  it's Oregon Trail! I'm not to far into the game but it seems like, so far, you don't have to spend your own money to have fun.

B006HL9G10|5.0|What a great little app.... Included in the timer is an entire community of people to support your practice. You can sign up with people that you know and keep an eye on each others practice. Nothing like peer pressure to keep you on track! You can make meditation friends from all over the world... join groups, read or add to discussions on various topics. And I haven't even mentioned the great bell sounds... the bells and tones sound like you have your own personal monk hitting the gong to start and end your session. If you are into stats, the app has you covered. You get your own personal pie chart and bar graph to give you visuals on how well you have done... and not only that, you are awarded little star-things when you hit various milestones. I hate to sound like such a child, but I like getting those little stars. I am pleased to announce that I have now meditated for one hundred days in a row. Without this app, I doubt that I would be able to say that. I on board with whatever it takes to keep me on board... and this app does. (The Be Here Now group has a lot of great discussions... when you buy it, join up!)
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie was as great as I remember it being when I was a kid.  There was a lot more swearing than I remembered, but overall fairly decent.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Incredible music.  I don't buy music unless I believe it to be very good and this CD is great!  I waited a long time to purchase.
B005DOKIYG|2.0|Its my fault really... I wasn't thinking well... You have to slide the book completely out of the case so I don't feel like I really get the protection from smears that I was looking for... I think I would have done better to have gotten one of the cases that you could just open like a book and read your kindle... I wish I had saved my $10 to apply to the better case... but we all know sometimes cheap... isn't best... so I learn... again...

1451648537|4.0|No other Jobs biography comes close to this one in terms of access to Jobs for input on his experiences spanning his entire life and career, so, major points there for Isaacson's book. I read it and enjoyed it after having read just about every Jobs book out there from The Little Kingdom, to The Journey is the Reward, to The Second Coming of SJ, to iCon, etc.  With that said, I have serious issues with this book.  Isaacson has no context for the technological side of the story. He gets the details wrong and I get the impression that he has glossed over details that connect the dots from an tech industry perspective. I don't think Isaacson understood the technology history and landscape well enough to ask Steve the right questions and get to the insights behind the facade. As John Gruber of DaringFireball.net said, Jobs &#34;hired the wrong guy&#34;, in regards to Jobs choice of Isaacson to author his biography. Those are the same words Jobs used in a mid-90s interview to describe John Sculley, the Apple CEO he courted to run Apple in the early 80s, and who essentially stripped Jobs of all power at Apple (Sculley went on to lead the decline of Apple by riding on the coattails of Jobs' team's efforts through the late 80s and early 90s, which you can read about in great detail in the 1997 book &#34;Apple&#34; by Jim Carlton).  Another major issue is the complete avoidance of Jobs' wilderness years at NeXT and Pixar. Isaacson barely touches the topic. These were essential, formative times in Jobs' life that molded him into the man who had the ability to return to Apple in 1997 and turn it into most successful company in the world, creating and shaping entirely new industry categories. It's clear that if Jobs had stayed at Apple, things would've ended badly for all involved in the 80s. His raw talent, vision, and business style was honed and tempered during the wilderness years from 1986-1996. Jobs experienced failure and struggle for the first time in his life - after becoming a multimillionaire playboy by the early 80s. He got what was coming to him, and he was better for it. Anyway, to barely touch on this in THE BIOGRAPHY of biographies about Jobs is a critical failure that can never be recovered since we've lost Jobs.  Like Scully, Isaacson didn't understand technology. That made him the wrong guy to write this book. Jobs was Apple. The products were an extension of himself. To not understand the technology is to not completely understand Jobs. Isaacson grokked Steve's personality and relationships, but struggled to put it all in sharp, focused context with the major events that Jobs shaped and influenced in the technology & entertainment industries. An obviously once-in-a-lifetime opportunity was blown with this book.  All that said, it still falls in the must read category. I STRONGLY suggest following this book with three other reads:  1. A Sister's Eulogy for Steve Jobs, a New York Times op ed by Jobs' sister Mona Simpson. She crafted what I consider to be the perfect, visceral, and emotional post-script to the Isaacson biography. It will bring you to tears. Wait to read it after you've completed the biography. I printed it, folded it, and placed it in the back cover of my copy of the biography.  2. The Second Coming of Steve Jobs by Alan Deutschman fills in some of the blanks left by Isaacson surrounding Jobs' time at NeXT, his wilderness years, as well as a blow-by-blow of Steve Jobs' dance with Disney & Pixar. Some of it is very foreboding in terms of what would become of Michael Eisner as a result of Jobs' sudden, enormous influence in the entertainment industry.  3. &#34;Inside Apple&#34; by Adam Lashinsky. Lashinsky had the benefit of reading Isaacson's book before delving into his tome on the inner working of Apple after Steve Jobs' return, and it feels like he was able to add shape and color in the places where Isaacson had nothing. Unfortunately, it's from an outsider's perspective and must be taken with a grain of salt, but between Carlton's &#34;Apple&#34; and Lashinsky's &#34;Inside Apple&#34;, Lashinky offers the superior reading experience, and makes for a perfect follow-up to &#34;Apple.&#34;
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I enjoyed this game a lot. However I found it too short.There wasn't a lot of challenge. It was over way to soon.but sence it's the type I enjoy, I'll try the next game.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|You must watch this movie. Far less blood and gore than is typical for Tarrentino. Incredible characters. Amazing multistory line setup that all gets tied together at the end,
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Fantastic book An absolute MUST read. I enjoyed this book because it was a parody mixed cleverly with some historical figures Really worth the read
076781214X|5.0|My wife love it when she was younger, so we ordered it. Movie plays very well and worked great. Came within a couple of days.
B009R659L8|4.0|I am always ready to solve her mysteries from the start.  I didn't figure this one out as soon as I have with other books.
0525953728|5.0|Should be required reading for every American so they can know the selfless sacrifice being made by our Warriors and the skill, integrity and brotherhood that defines our elite fighting men and women.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game for passing time on roadtrip.  Entertained the entire family.  Some of the rooms are very challenging. I cant wait for more rooms.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app comes in handy when trying to plan my day and plan for weekend getaways. Would recommend this app to friends and family.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Very good movie. I thought it would be more of a chick flick than it was. Here are four more words so I can submit this
B002BEJ3BK|5.0|What else needs to be said?<br /><br />This album is hip hop and it's always a good thing. Black Thought continues to be CRIMINALLY underrated. Great music from a real hip hop BAND!!!!
0307476073|5.0|Although the story is more about the author's life and problems than I expected, it all ties in with her hike.  Once on the Pacific Crest Trail, she makes you feel as though you are there and can feel the heat, pain and joy that she experiences.  When I finished this book, I started reading it again to find anything that I might have missed the first time and to re experience the hike.  As a Washington State hiker, loved this book!
B004D7GU3M|5.0|Still wish they had released Graduation on Vinyl, but that's for another rant. This is Kanye West and he is back to rapping, which was sorely missed on 808's & Heartbreaks
