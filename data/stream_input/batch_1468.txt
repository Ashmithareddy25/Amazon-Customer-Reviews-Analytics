B0015DROBO|4.0|Being unfamiliar with the names of Swedish cities and towns, the first chapter or two was a challenge. The Swedish surnames made it difficult to remember who is who. No complaint about the storyline however. I am nearly finished with the second of the trilogy, and am anxious to start the third.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|I can remember as a younger father playing the Hasbro game with my kids.  I also have a vague recollection of playing a version as a kid myself using a pencil and paper but that could be just dead brain cells floating around.  Speaking of dead brain cells...with a movie like \\"Battleship\\" it is usually a good idea to set the bar low (pick a Michael Bay movie) and just relax.  For me, I use the second \\"Transformers\\" movie \\"Revenge of the Fallen\\" as my standard.<br /><br />Here we have some early scenes that actually aren't bad and begin to flesh out the characters.  The focus is on bad boy, Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) who somehow becomes a U. S. Navy officer at the insistence of his big brother, Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) who already is a Commander.  Unless memory again fades, having been in the Navy myself it is unlikely that they would accept a drunken felon into their officer corps (i.e. Alex) but maybe things have changed.<br /><br />While this is a minor nit not worth picking, there are so many other flawed aspects of the film, it can't be taken seriously.  The good news is that the movie is wildly, if absurdly, entertaining.  It is decently constructed with a beginning, middle and an end.  The movie is extremely loud at times, especially when the alien visitors take offense at being threatened and launch their razor sharp ball bearing thingies.  I mean, the Earthlings did invite them, right?  All is well that ends well, especially when you have the mothballed (yet battle ready!) U.S.S. Missouri easily launched with a skeleton crew (pun intended).

B005LAIHGI|4.0|Call me a sometime Sacha Baron Cohen fan.  While I liked \\"Borat\\" (in a perverse way), I thought Bruno was pretty stupid.  \\"The Dictator\\" is more Borat than Bruno.  Cohen plays the part of a ruthless dictator of a North African country that is trying to develop all kinds of weapons of mass destruction but is particularly fond of a nuclear bomb.  He argues with his chief weapons scientist because he insists the bomb have a \\"pointy\\" end.  The scientist, Nadal is played by Jason Mantzoukas (TV's \\"The League\\").  He manages to steal almost every scene he's in.<br /><br />Aladeen, the Dictator must travel to New York to address the U.N. so that military action is not taken against his country by the rest of the world.  Once there he is replaced by a lookalike (also Cohen) under the control of his assistant and political rival (a smirking Ben Kingsley).  Like most great comedians who use insults and extremism to be funny, Cohen (who also co-wrote) goes after everybody and everything including the democratic form of government.  In one scene he defends his political change from a dictatorship to democracy using the U. S. as his beacon by defining current political differences as examples.  The \\"one-percenters\\" won't likely be laughing.<br /><br />The film is loaded with numerous cameos including Megan Fox as herself having a one-night stand with Aladeen.  Cohen's material will offend many so take this as fair warning.  For me, I found this more hilarious than cringe-worthy.  I liked it in spite of the fact than many of the punch lines are given away in the numerous TV and movie trailers.<br /><br />The Blu ray is shown in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It is digitally shot but has a look of film and is very good.  Colors of varying hues are part of the film's fun and they are excellently projected here.  The primary audio track is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  While it might not be demo worthy, it is still very good.  There isn't much going on in the surrounds but this is the nature of the film.  Center channeled dialog is clear.  The package includes a DVD version, several deleted scenes, a music video and more.e nature of the film.  Center channeled dialog is clear.

B006KSAPV0|4.0|Finding an improbable middle ground between classic \\"Frankenstein\\" and torture porn, Pedro Almodovar delivers this unsettling film with his old buddy from his 1990 \\"Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, Antonio Banderas.  Here Bandaras plays Dr. Robert Ledgard a prominent plastic surgeon in Spain who has crossed ethical boundaries in developing a genetically grown skin impervious to pain and some diseases.  His subject, a beautiful young woman named Vera (Elena Anaya) appears to be a patient, but is also a prisoner of sorts, locked in a room in Roberto's villa.<br /><br />In a series of flashbacks that take us back 6 years we learn that Dr. Ledgard's wife was a bit unstable and began an affair with Roberto's strange half brother (he is unaware of that bio-link).  They were involved in a serious auto accident.  The brother, Zeca (Roberto Alamo) walked away but the wife was seriously burned and ultimately takes her own life.  There is also a daughter, Norma (Blanca Suarez) who has psychiatric issues of her own.  At about 17, while at a wedding, she meets a young man named Vicente (Jan Cornet).  They are both strung out on pills, take a walk in the garden and one thing leads to another.  She begins to panic, starts screaming and Vicente heads for the hills.<br /><br />The doctor finding his daughter unkempt, tracks down Vicente and tranquilizes him.  Taken to an underground storage area in his house, Ledgard can now avenge a wrong he believes was perpetrated on his daughter but has found the right guinea pig for his experiments.  Things get really weird after that leading back to the current day.  I will admit, this film had me squirming in my seat most of the time.  In an unforgiving roll, Banderas is very good as the twisted doctor.  The character and the film could have easily taken a laughable turn, but it doesn't.  The subject matter is very disquieting and will likely turn off many viewers.  Miss Anaya is very good and dare I say a real eyeful.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is by the always reliable Sony and is delivered in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As with nearly all Sony Blu ray discs, the picture is nearly perfect.  Clear, crisp and colorful in the right perspective.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is likewise excellent.  The source material isn't demo worthy but you should have no problem with room filling sound.is by the always reliable Sony and is delivered in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.

B001DE29SS|5.0|First off a warning: For all those people thinking this should be funny because Charlie Chaplin was funny ... it isn't.<br />This movie is a masterpiece. It explores the life of Charlie Chaplin with all the complexities that life has to offer.<br />This film is a beautiful work of art. Quality that rivals Hollywoods Golden Age that we rarely get to see. Centered around an actual storyline rather than relying on special effects, or over-payed \\"A-List\\" movie stars. Each actor/actress was carefully chosen. Great depth and detail went into this film. Included in the writing credits is Charlie Chaplin himself from his book (IMDB), so that adds an additional credibility to the content of the film.<br />Another aspect that brings life to this story is the amazing Geraldine Chaplin, Charlies daughter, who had the wonderful job of portraying her grandmother, Hannah Chaplin.<br />Robert Downey Jr pours his soul into bringing this character to life. This is by far the finest performance of his career, of which he should have won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but lost out to Clint Eastwood for Unforgiven (of all films).<br />If Robert's and Geraldine's uncanny performances and Sir Richard Attenborough's brilliant directorial vison isn't enough; the film sports an all-star cast including:<br />Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks,Sir Anthony Hopkins, Milla Jovovich, Diane Lane, Marisa Tomei, Penelope Ann  Miller, Kevin Dunn (as J. Edgar Hoover),Dan Aykroyd, Nancy Travis and Moira Kelly.<br />Charlie Chaplin lived a life worth telling; Sir Richard Attenborough made a film worth watching ... repeatedly!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I purchased this book on my kindle based upon the reviews. I was not disappointed. There were times I had to put the book down to take care of domestic chores, but it was always on my mind. Still is. There are many things to consider in this novel: Who done it? The Violence Gene.. The relationships between fathers and sons; And the way trials work.  All kept me enthralled until the very end. The ending left me in a mind stutter.<br />I would recommend this book. It is still on my mind!

0307951529|5.0|Another fantastic book from Chris Guillebeau is here. I was already a fan of his writing, and thought this would be the same stuff he's already written, reformatted. I was very wrong!<br /><br />Of the 1500 case studies he gathered data to put this book together, only about 70 living examples made it into the book. They are so varied and unrelated, that it makes tough the job of the consummate pessimist to dismiss this book as another \\"follow your passion...\\" business fluff book.<br /><br />There are real-world examples in so many combinations and types of businesses, you'd have to dig deep to toss this one aside. This isn't theory, it's people who have done it. People who are doing it. Simple, deliberate actions that can get you going in the world of today's business, using the skills and resources you already have.<br /><br />This is not the old way of doing business: no going into debt, no need for large sums of (usually other peoples') money, and no special degrees or skills needed. With today's resources and mostly-free tools, there is no reason you can't get going with your own business today.<br /><br />I'm already going through it a second time, to get my own business better in line with where I want it to be. This is a fantastic resource for those who want to start their own business, or are already on the path, looking to improve it!
B001AQO41E|4.0|Again, a BD with minimal special features, all of which were available on the DVD release. I promise, not ranting this time. And I won't go into the plot. Put simply, if you haven't seen this movie and are a horror fan, you've done yourself a terrible disservice.<br /><br />What presentation has going for it is incredible visual effects that breathe a life of their own in this BD format. The soundtrack is 5.1 (I still wish for a day where 7.1 is the industry standard), and there are a dozen plus languages for subtitles. The packaging itself is a small data book with interesting recollections, comments by some of the cast and crew (though nothing die-hard fans might not have known prior).<br /><br />This BD release isn't made to do more than primp the appearance of the film, though it does so very nicely. Despite a lack of trimmings of terror and side dishes of special features, I do advise updating from the DVD to this BD based solely on the HD presentation.<br /><br />Who's ready to get creeped out again? I'll bring the snacks.

B0034G4ORM|4.0|It's a popcorn flick, plain and simple. It worked for ID4, and it works again here.<br /><br />Not a lot of thought put into the script, and not a lot of acting from the cast, despite having heavy weight Aaron Eckhart who was most likely the sole reason for a fair number of folk to sit down and watch the flick in the first place.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the visuals are pretty cool, and there's a range of behind the scenes goodness that isn't boring to sit through. It simply wasn't the massive epicness folk wanted it to be - it plays like Halo without the Master Chief. So it's not a bad film. Just don't expect award-winning anything from it, turn off your brain, and watch the explosions.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|this movie does what very few action stars do, its own stunts, meaning tom really hanging off the tallest building in the world. that alone made me more anxious to see this movie. great action all the way and very entertaining from begining to end.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|A couple of months ago my husband summoned me from the living room to \\"come listen, you gotta SEE THIS!\\"  \\"What is it?\\" (I preferred to remain a couch potato).  My husband was emphatic about a guy who had a great voice and played guitar better than Clapton.  I got up from the sofa and followed him to the back bedroom.  PBS was showing parts of Joe Bonamassa's Beacon Theatre performance in New York.<br /><br />I sat down on the bed and did not move until the program was over.<br /><br />\\"Well?!\\"  My husband asked, \\"What do you think about that?!\\"<br /><br />Memories were flooding my conscious, of Clapton with Cream and Derek & The Dominos, Crossroads, Stevie Ray Vaughn at Montreaux, \\"Clapton is God\\" scrawled on the bricks in London, oh so many years ago now.  Jeff Beck, Carlos Santana, the stylists in different genres for the history of the electric guitar, including Les Paul.<br /><br />\\"I think I've just seen the best guitarist I've ever seen.\\"<br /><br />I stand by that statement, and will see Mr. Bonamassa at year's end.  I own two DVDs, three CDs, and with each passing year this prodigy has only gotten better.  He is the best-kept secret, a non-label affiliated superstar, around today.<br /><br />Jan G.

I found out about this from other bass players on the talk bass forum, the author, Ed Friedland, is also a talk bass member. I bought this book, because I want to learn to read music and not just tab.  Ed has taught at Berklee and has played with some well known artist. In my opinion, you won't go wrong buying this book.

B007NESBK2|5.0|I missed Sade during the Lovers Rock Tour so I vowed to make sure I attended this one.  I actually attended the Auburn Hills, MI and the Las Vegas shows.  They were absolutely awesome!  As usual, the band was awesome and the show used the video screens perfectly.  It was a great balance of high tech and minimalist.  I have been waiting for this to com out on Blu Ray and I am excited to get it!

I can hardly wait to see how you top this one...perhaps a sequel with the same heroine? I have to also mention that I really appreciate being able to tap the screen w/o the annoying '20-second' penalty that another app uses. If there is no way to maximize or minumize a screen while searching for objects or pieces of objects, I don't feel there should be a penalty for searching for whatever is required. Great graphics and clever story!
0545405777|5.0|I decided to get the book after seeing and enjoying the movie. I'm glad I did. The Hunger Games is a very good book. It had me very invested and I finished it in just a couple days.

1468161660|5.0|I wrote a longer review of this on Goodreads, but I had to say to say something here too. If you love romance, and if you have poems running through your head 24/7 and even if you don't -- and even if you've never heard of the Avett Brothers before reading this book, (like me) I guarantee you will have poems swimming through your head after you read this, you will download Avett Brothers songs and listen to the words--and wonder just how it is you like a band that also has a banjo in it. ha.<br /><br />And you will love words so much more than you did before reading it, and write things down more and think about stuff in a different way--and ponder this book long long long after you stop reading it. Colleen Hoover... I know a bajillion other people reviewed this book and so maybe you won't ever see this one, but I did love it so much.

0345803485|5.0|I have to confess that I wasn't necessarily in love with this book from the get-go.  My initial perceptions of the enigmatic Christian Grey were not immensely favorable, simply because I couldn't get behind the S&M portions of the book (no pun intended).  However, the character and the book are simply not that one-dimensional to be broad-brushed as an S&M fantasy novel.  The more you read, the more you realize that this is in fact a fantastic story of the evolution and redemption of a tragically dark man who winds up shining through the love of the female lead, Anastasia Steele. It's a brilliant love story. It's a meeting of minds (and certainly bodies) in an emotional roller coaster ride that you simply don't want to end. And fortunately, it doesn't. Book two is, in my opinion, many times better than the first.  It's also worth noting that there are also grin-inducing light moments in the book - unquestionably, my favorite passages are the humorously and artfully written emails betweeen Christian and Ana.<br /><br />That said, I realize this novel has received more than a fair amount of flack for its technical flaws. As an author, I can relate to the highly positive and negative reviews; I certainly do not wish to draw the ire of those passionately set against the merits of this book, but with all due respect, most people condemning the technical flaws have never written a novel, much less a trilogy. Granted, blatant flaws probably should have been edited out (over-used words and phrases, oddly placed language, British vernacular, etc.), but in the end, it doesn't change the fact that this woman told a wonderful love story. In any book, there is certainly a measure of technical prowess, but equally important if not moreso is the ability to really speak to the audience and potentially profoundly affect them. There is no question that this book has done just that. The numbers speak for themselves. Millions of women can't be wrong. E.L. James has successfully taken a taboo genre, brought it to the mainstream, and left us begging for more.  Kudos on a job well done!<br /><br />-J.L.

B000FC1RCI|4.0|Great work of Agatha Christie. Strange island and ten people who have lived with personal guilty (maybe except one). Death one by one. Perhaps, as a 21c teenager, this novel is little bit old and too simple. I already knew how story flew even before I read this book. So there was no \\"shock\\". However, her writing skill is so good. Characters are alive in text. Their \\"unchanging\\" personality(characteristic), though, is somewhat old-fashioned, their narrative is realistic. For readers who love mistery, I recommend this novel.

After running in a building to save one, the key to saving both may lay in who started the fire. A little perspective helps Grace open her eyes and questions everyone she thought she knew.<br /><br />Lupton cribs the same narrative style she employed in Sister, retrospect. Which isn't my favorite way to keep up the suspense, but there is enough mystery here to keep the reader well engaged. There were almost too many plot twists. The pacing ran towards slow in the beginning, but it does pick up to the point where you won't want to set aside the book for anything. Even though I did like Sister, I loved Afterwards. I think I've found a new favorite author.

B000784WMW|3.0|This is the third version of Jane Eyre that I've recently watched(2007 Masterpiece Theatre & 2011 movie), and I have to say it's my least favorite.  While the script is very close to the book, I couldn't get past the dated feel of the cinematography to enjoy the movie much.  For example, the lighting, sound track and shot angles were very distracting to me in their corny 1980's soap operish feel.  Timothy Dalton plays Rochester quite well, but I didn't like the way Jane was portrayed.  For one, she was so short, she truly looked like a child next to Rochester.  I also didn't like her meak doe eyed demeanor.<br />Personally, I like the 2011 movie version the best.  While not quite as true to the book, I enjoyed it the most.
B0053O89Z6|4.0|This season wasnt the best of the whole seven years but it was still good. I felt in a way it was a filler. They were trying to fill gaps and end relationships in order for the next season to stand out and move the characters forward.<br /><br />Lily and Marshall moved from the city to the suburbs then back to the city. I felt for them it was a journey to figuring out where they were going to be parents. Not just who they were going to be as parents but where they were going to be. In the end they went back to where they felt most at home and I think for them that's going to be a great move.<br /><br />Ted and Robin finally ended their five year relationship. Dont believe me take a look at the amount of times they've either made out or had sex just because they could. They've basically been in a relationship since they go together. It was time for them to let go and it took the words of Victoria to help push Ted to that point and the actions of Robin to finally get him there.<br /><br />For Robin this year was about finding what she really wants. She found out that she couldnt have children and it finally answered the question of why Robin doesnt have kids in the future. It was sad but I loved that the show went to a place not many other shows go to when it comes to fertility. I really enjoyed that storyline.<br /><br />For Barney it was realizing that he wants the same things that Ted has wanted for years. He even wants kids which doesnt seem that farfetched for someone like Barney who is finally back in touch with his biological father. Then of course he ends up engaged to the stripper. I'm not sure I like her and it's comforting knowing that they dont end up together because they just seem like they would have too many issues if they got married.<br /><br />This season wasnt stellar but it closed some doors and gave some answers to a few questions that I've had for years. Though there was one big thing I didnt like. I didnt like that Ted took off with Victoria. He just did to someone else what was done to him. I dont like that at all.<br /><br />Either way I cant wait till next season to see where life takes the characters.e just did to someone else what was done to him.

Even Black Beauty, which is narrated by the horse, feels more real than this film.<br />There are touching moments, but I got very tired of listening to horsing constantly making noise, which is uncharacteristic, and putting up with things that would never have worked to train a horse. (To clarify, I realize the whole premise is a bit out there, as it really is a needle in a haystack type of story. However, in the book I was never left going \\"yeah right\\" as I was OFTEN in the movie.)<br />So, anyone who doesn't know a thing about horses, and is looking for a well shot war movie about a horse, you may like this. I did not.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Only problem is that there are only 3 books to the series. Just incredible.  Only wish i couldread them for the first time again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Perfect book with a mix of romance and suspense. I would reccomend this book to 18+ And for those who enjoyed twilight
0525478817|5.0|I am an adult, a closer to forty than thirty year old woman, and I really enjoyed this book. I loved that it was honest about the struggles the characters were facing with their cancer. I loved that the characters, and not just the primary ones, were fully developed and engaging. Each character draws you into their part of the story and illustrates the complexity of relationships. I loved that the family ties were never superseded or displaced by the teenage bonds that develop.<br /><br />This book is smart. The kids are smart. The parents are facing heartbreaking realities. The friends are faced with holding onto the pieces they are given.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I smelled a rat immediately with the mother's occupation but that didn't take anything away from the story.  I found myself rooting for these people, just as I root for the bad guys who want to rob a casino,..or bank.  The characers were well defined, the reader will definitely find favorites among the cast of characters. and not so favorites. There was everything that a novel calls for, suspense, adultry,secrets. and surprises. I liked the book a lot. I loaned it to my daughter and I only loan out \\"keepers.\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is quite addictive as well as mind challenging. Quell is one of the best games I have found for my Kindle Fire.i
B004LSJCJM|5.0|This album to me is J. Bonamassa's finest work yet. Seems like every song is Great. All I can say is I have a couple of his others CD's but this one IMO is the best yet.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I wanted the Kindle Fire pretty badly...but I was a bit upset about replacing my books with digital books. I;m a huge book worm to the point where the smell of Barnes and Nobles calms me.  But, I really wanted to be able to bring multiple books with me on vacation and such and not take up so much room. Plus, I wanted the apps. So this cover really helped me feel like I'm still reading a book. Not completely, but good enough. It's thick and stable. I feel like my Fire is very safe tucked away in here. Would have liked something that keeps it held up while I stream videos, yea that would have been a nice perk. But for me...it's perfect.
0061906220|5.0|We love this book.  I got this book from a reccomendation of the librarian to learn colors.  She said you have to go to the website to hear the song.  It was a hit from the first read.  We have a cat at home so my son loved Pete right away.  We sing the song about all sorts of things in our real life so we can learn the colors of objects.  It's a great way to introduce a young toddler to colors. After a few reads my son can tell me the story \\"Oh No! Strawberry shoes!\\"  comes out in toddler speak.  It's so cute!
6074570027|3.0|The story is talked a little slow, but is very good this is a book everybody should read every ten years.
0553584537|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel. It kept me turning the pages. I didn't like the<br />ending, though. I guess I like stories with happier endings. That said, I would<br />still highly recommend this book. It's a well-written thriller that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />HOWEVER: In looking at the one-star reviews of Gardner's \\"The Neighbor,\\" I saw something that really bothered me about the present book. La Boomba gave \\"The Neighbor\\" one star and wrote something about the character DD Warren that I agree with:<br /><br />\\"There have been a number of Lisa Gardner books I've enjoyed in the past. Here comes the but. She has started bringing the character of DD Warren to the forefront in her stories. I find this policewoman to be unbelievably stupid, foolish, and stubborn. She gets a first impression in her head about who has committed a crime, how it was done, etc. And she is, inevitably, wrong, wrong, wrong. It wouldn't be so bad if she showed a shred of good humor along the way, but all she does is snarl and growl through the whole bit. And she's not even gracious when she's proven wrong. Add to that her jealousy over her ex-lover's new wife and this woman is so insufferable that I have stopped buying any books in which she is a character.\\"
0446585025|5.0|Picked up the book on my Kindle because I was truly feeling depressed.  I asked myself what, who, could make me smile.  I glanced at my computer screen and there was a photo of Ellen.. don't even remember what the article was about.  So I eventually ended up here on Amazon and got the book. It turned a dreary day bright, and reminded me that silly is truly good enough sometimes.  It is a completely silly book. It is the quirky awkward have to read it twice to get it kind of humor that is Ellen's trademark.  But here and there are these little nuggets of wisdom on how to take care of yourself and be happy.  Then back to silly.  Kind of like how I put my dog's pills in peanut butter to make it go down better.  If you are expecting a serious memoir on her life, this isn't it.  I do hope that she does do a retrospective at some point.  But if you are feeling blue, and need something that is an easy read that can pep you up and put you back on the right track, this is a good choice.  I have read reviews saying it is woman affirming, and that could be true.. but I am a guy and I enjoyed it cover to cover so you don't have to be female to get a smile from it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read the first two books of the trilogy and I am about to buy and read the third. I can't seem to put these books down. E.L. James is such a good writer. I can't wait to read more of her books. My advice to first time readers: don't read ANY reviews, good or bad. Read the books for yourself!!
B006X415GK|4.0|My daughter loves the Monster High Dolls!!  This one has short hair that seems to be glued to her head.  Very stiff and flat.  But if it gets messed with it will stay in the unnatural position it is left in.  Can't put it easily back into place.  What is on this hair???? My daughter would like it to be like other doll hair, so it is easier to use.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|If you're running any version of Linux on your host computer, you can't use Splashtop on your Kindle Fire.  There is no Splashtop Streamer for Linux.  How a company can hope to be taken seriously in this day and age while not supporting Linux is beyond me.

0785162348|5.0|The Art of Marvel's The Avengers is a fantastic step into the world of MARVEL STUDIOS. I am a young filmmaker in highschoo bound to be a future film editor. This book totally helped me to keep acheiving my dream. The book will take hard core MARVEL fans into the films amazing concept art. Featuring stunnig artwrok with final stills from the film. The book also features script excerpts by Writer/Director Joss Whedon. It includes interview with Joss Whedon and the whole entire cast. The book includes a recap of all of the characters in the previous MARVEL films, such as; Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Nick Fury, Loki, Black Widow, Agent Phil Coulson, Dr. Erik Selvig. The book also introduces the new charaters. Agent Maria Hill, The Chitauri, The Other. The book also recaps the origin of the Tesseract, the object Loki will use to rule Earth. this book is so amazing! For hard core MARVEL fans, filmmakers (like me), and any film fan, The Art of Marvel's The Avengers is a book that everybody will cherish forever.
1423124960|3.0|This book was a present for my little daughter. The book arrived with first 3 pages torn off. This is so disappointing. I didn't have enough time to send it back, so I ended up trying to glue pages back to the book. Looks so ugly now. The book content is great though and the pictures are very colorful.
0553807919|5.0|As a child therapist, I highly recommend this book.  Siegel gives scientific evidence to the psychological.  It's presented in an easily understood format...perfect for parents and educators.  It gives insight as to \\"why\\" a child is reacting the way they are and ways to deal with it... a must have book.
1451627289|2.0|I really do not understand the high ratings attached to this novel! It did not cover much of what was suppose to be about JFK and was more about a sappy romance. This book could have achieved it's objective in easily half of the space. There were multiple drawn out descriptions that did not enhance the reader's experience. If you want one book to spend hours reading without having to think... buy this book.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this case/cover! It does not add bulk to the Kindle Fire, acts as a stand, has a soft felt lining so it will not scratch the screen and has a band to keep in either open or closed. Great design!!! Great price!!

B003V4AK8E|3.0|We don't play the PS3 much anymore but this controller was a decent quality one and held up fine. I'm not much of a gamer so the fact the rubber buttons and toggles didn't come off means it was worth it! It held battery strength just fine and overall was a decent controller for the price.
B007XWFZSA|5.0|Must-have for current or wanna-be consultants and problem solvers! Great book. It is both comprehensive and easy to follow. Thank you, Victor.
0345803485|3.0|I've read all three....the love story is not bad...every girl wants to marry a Billionaire...however, the sex got too sick for me.  I can overlook bad writers, as I've read all the twilight series as well....but really....butt plugs.  Christian had a hard childhood but got cured my a sadist?  That seems to screw him up even more....to want to be the master of subs.  I don't know...I found the books enjoyable if I skipped over the weird sex.  I like a love story with a happy ending.  It goes to show that you don't have to be a great writer to write books...perhaps I will write one.
B0081HLM2E|4.0|Headhunters (2011 release from Norway; 100 min.) brings the tale of 5ft7 (not tall enough? just watch the movie!) Roger Brown, who is in the recruiting business (hence the movie's title), but in order to keep up his lavish life style and to continually impress his impossibly beautiful wife Diana, Roger has a side business of sorts: he, with the aide of a side kick, steals valuable art from people's homes, to sell it on the black market. All goes well until at some point Roger meets Dutch business man Clas Greve. Clas has an interesting background and might fit the profile for the CEO position that Roger's headhunting agency is trying to fill. On top of that, Clas' grandmother, who just passed away in Oslo, apparently has some extremely valuable art in her private collection...<br /><br />The above is the basic premise of the movie, and to give away much more would flat-out ruin your viewing experience. Suffice it to say that not everything is what it seems to be. From the movie's beginning, the pace is relentless, and I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie (as were most of the fellow theatre visitors I saw it with this past weekend). Indeed, there is hardly any \\"down\\" time in the movie, because once the basic premise of the movie is set, we fall from one surprise into the next, without it being \\"over the top\\" or implausible.<br /><br />When this movie came out in Norway last year, it immediately was a box office smash, and that success was later repeated in many European countries. Now it's finally in the US, and by all means it should do well here to. Even though it was made in a different country than the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, \\"Headhunters\\" definitely has a similar feel about it, albeit never quite as dark as the Dragon Tattoo trilogy. In all, this movie has been one of the best surprises for me among the theatre movie releases I've seen so far in 2012. If you like a clever and exciting foreign action thriller, you cannot go wrong with this. \\"Headhunters\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!ers\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game reminds me of Mario Bros. for the NES. Nice; free app. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game resembling Mario for Kindle.
0375851569|4.0|After reading a couple reviews I was worried these books would be low quality, but I ordered them anyway.  The books are not the original large ones I remember, but they're a good size, ~ 7\\" x 9\\".  They're hardcover and the binding is good.  The pages are not terribly thin as one reviewer said. The colors and printing are good. All-in-all, perfectly fine books.  Glad I bought them.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|More stories should be told this way. It tells our drama as seen by the non human part of the family. It was sad for me as we just put our aging lab down due to bone cancer in the past 5 months. I hope to meet him when I pass on as I believe in dog but not the other word spelled with the same letters.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book made it easy to keep reading. I like how the trilogy's are now one continuing book instead of 3 separate books.
1455869880|5.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /> My mother was having a hard time in buying me this book because she thought it would be a depressing novel, though she couldn't be more wrong. This book is filled with love, Hazel and Augustus love for each other, Hazals parents love for her, and Augustus parents love for him. The book is filled with so much meaning and when Augustus died all I could do was cry. All I could think about was what Augustus said, \\"Oh, I wouldn't mind, Hazel Grace. it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you\\" and thinking how ironic is it. Amazing book that I would recommend to anyone.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a must-read for everyone who enjoys not only romance novels, but exploring or learning about the darker side of humanity. Stunningly written, this book draws you in so completely to connect you with both main characters. I can't wait to read the second and third books (and am very sad that I can't start them right now....since I haven't bought them yet).
0670023329|5.0|I must admit that as a 19 year old my world view is not as large as older and more experienced persons. I was astounded to read this book! I can not believe that there are concentration camps alive and functioning in the world today. To read this book and hear Shin's story is to rip your heart out and have it be put back together as you you harden your resolve to help stop this ongoing disaster.<br /><br />As you read this book you feel sick. But its all to the greater good. As my world view expands I have a strong desire to help this young man and to join with others to put a stop to these atrocities! You will want, and you need!, to read this book. Only by learning these stories and by learning where you stand will you be able to help change the world.<br /><br />Through every heartache you feel a pang! But at the end you will be greatful and you will grab your friends and neighbors to help spread the horrors taking place behind the lines of North Korea.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|`Very interesting but a little over the top with how 'tortured' Jace is.  In general, a very entertaining book.  Some of the plot twists very clever.  Enjoyed reading about the different types of Downworlders.  Great character development.

0142437611|4.0|Bellow's esteemed novella is a marvel of immanently crafted, modern realism. Situated within the course of a day, Bellow brings us into the life of Tommy Wilhelm, a middle-aged failure who is looked down upon by his father, his ex-wife, and just about everybody else. When he is propositioned with an opportunity by a true snake-oil-salesman to play in the stock market, Tommy's fortunes fall even farther into disrepair. Bellow's prose is beautifully ornamented with a textured sense of detail-and there is genuine pathos to be found here-but I can't help but feel unmoved by the self-conscious sense of the epiphanic structure Bellow imposes. A fine work nevertheless.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I heard about A Game of Thrones like many people that have recently read the book, from the HBO series.  A bit of warning to new readers.  The author pushes you right into the deep end from the start.  People or places or events mentioned may not be brought back up or explained until later in the book.  There are A LOT of characters and it is easy to get you houses and family members mixed up.  With that being said if you can make through the first 100 pages you will be set for the rest of the book.<br /><br />  The main storyline is set a few decades after a bloody rebellion in which the rebels defeated House Targaryen (the current ruling house) and set a new king on the throne.  You follow the story of 4 Houses, House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and the remnants of House Targaryen.  Character development is some of the best I have ever read.  Most of the characters are not only changed from the beginning to the end of the novel, they have been drastically changed from the events.  Fight scenes were executed marvelously and the action was pretty much nonstop for the majority of the book.  Moral choices for the characters pop up at every turn and at times you even question yourself at what you think is right.<br /><br />  A Game of Thrones is one of the few novels I have read that really got me emotionally involved with the story.  I really care for the characters and felt genuine remorse (and excitement in some cases) for the death of characters who did not make it.  This novel is not for the faint of heart as there is a lot of adult content, such as sex, rape, murder, war, and so on.  After putting down this book I have started right into A Clash of Kings as I could not wait to continue this grand adventure.
1401937519|5.0|The book put all the years of reading over many years together in a clear and authentic way.  It was a relief to me to find - finally -  a book that fit me personally to a \\"T\\".  I keep going back to certain passages just to confirm to myself, that Anita really did write that - - - as it was such a confirmaion for me to read that someone had actually experienced a NDE and was living her purpose at last.  My thanks go out to her, Dr. Wayne Dyer - for his forward, and Amazon for the book!!!!!  Sincerely,  Dorothy Grigg.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This review is for the Kindle version of Stephen King's novel. It's not about the content. The Kindle edition is very good. Fonts, spacing, navigation, everything is done very well.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I love the whole Fifty Shades trilogy but this one for me is the best.  It was kind of bittersweet though for me - as happy as I was to finish the story of Christian and Ana (and to finally see them both get their happy ending), I didnt want to stop reading.  All good things come to an end but I'd love for their story to keep going!
B006MPKE9O|4.0|A very decent read difficult to put down once you are into it.<br />but not sure if its worth recommending.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was fantastic, I devoured it!<br /><br />Some have critised the \\"violent and disturbing nature of Travis and their relationship\\" but to me, these people just missed the point of this book.  Sure their relationship isn't easy, it requires work from them both.  At times I wanted to slap Abby and talk some sense into her/tell her to follow her heart, but that was the beauty of this story - the characters are real!<br /><br />I read it in less than a day, I couldnt put it down.  After reading two more novels I went back and re-read it :) I'm hoping for a sequal to read on and discover more of Travis and Pidge's life together.  Or perhaps something about America and Shep :) Fingers crossed!
B007T2XC7A|5.0|More good tunes from an amazing voice.  Would make nice background music at a party or driving.  Her lyrics are lovely.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Okay, yes Ana is naive, and yes she repeats herself a lot, and yes the fact his eyes are Grey comes up often, but who cares.  I loved this novel, and the rest of the triology.<br /><br />It is an easy read and you can't help but get caught up in their world.  What will happen to them next, will they work out their relationship, what has happened to Christian in his past?  Their spicy sexual trists just add to the story and create more enjoyment for the reader in a book that I loved and will read again and again.<br /><br />There are some very, very loose similarities with Twilight but to me (as I read all 3 books) I'd have to say there was a lot of Pretty Woman in there too.<br /><br />If you like a light bedtime read (or perhaps not, as I couldnt put it down...!) and dont care too much about 'literary excellence', you will enjoy this story immensely.
0061537969|5.0|A great story who would have thought a book from the dogs eyes would be so good! I could not put it down!!! A must read and I will recommend to everyone I know who likes to trad!
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I think if you are considering reading Fifty Shades Darker it is because you loved Fifty Shades of Grey; therefore you probably dont need to read through the reviews to get advice whether to keep going or not!<br /><br />But if you're undecided; do it!  This book is also fantastic.  Even better than the first one I think.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Because this was based on fan fiction, I should've known it would be horribly horrible. And yet because it's such a \\"thing\\" now I had to satisfy my curiosity. Boy do I regret spending that $9.99 on the Kindle version. I wish I could get my money back. Literally nothing happens in this book. Plot wise there is nothing intriguing or interesting. I should have known this the whole time I was reading it, but really it's just sex. They have sex over and over again and she melts whenever she looks at him. The end. Save your money and don't believe the hype.<br /><br />I really was warned multiple times though: a) it's based on Twilight fan fiction. Twilight was awfully written about a girl who melts whenever she's around a guy. b) it's based on fan fiction. Need I say more?

B0025KVLT2|3.0|Here goes, what I've heard about the best Beatles Masters from EMI under George Martin through out the World is from Germany. And sometimes from Japan as well, don't know what it's doing over there? Boy, doesn't this sound like finding an old silent movie back in the 20's? Where John or Paul sing in center with a little feed back left and right, remember EMI? How the main Voice bounced from left to right or right to left on Main Center like a One Beat Echo on the Headphones, giving that Stereo Effect? You know? Like it was meant to be when bought back in 1965? That's a LOW serial stock number Rubber Soul Album made from Capital Records! I Think, because, it's not a promo! And when pressing Mono, it gives You True Mono. And when pressing Stereo, it gives You True Stereo! Sorry Folks, just trying to get more in detail here! Drums and Guitars not to far apart. Highs are crisp and not to much Bass. Overall True Stereo. This is the year 2012 EMI, not the time when CD's ever came OUT. What was that, the late 70's? Even when We didn't have Lap Top Computers!!!!!!! OK! You guys got a lot of money to hire people to travel all over the World to find excellent mastering tapes from the Beatles. HELL, if you could do it for Hank Thompson, why not the Beatles, or is it that same comment from John about you know who? Even a low serial number from a box that comes from a reel to reel Columbia House tape or a 4 Track Muntz tape made from the same time period that goes 3 1/2 speed can work better than this. Remember, the original tape on a LOW serial number when BOUGHT from somebody at that time! I mean, what is it?, is it legal rights, a certain time frame period by law on mastering of something? Now, I know theirs Studio Outtakes from these Songs. It can go from 1 to 50 or 1 to 100! Heck, just ask The Byrds about Terry Melcher on that one! Boy, what a Guy! Were, I just don't know if these are the Original Outtakes when pressed on Vinyl back in 65' when I hear YOUR songs on CD! People, are You thinking what I'm thinking, the 6000 series Capital Records made for Canada? And the Guy saying something about going DVD and this 5.1 crap, sorry Dude, I can't buy that! You also cut out 6 original songs from The Trip Soundtrack Movie Album as well, (hiding behind the backs of CURB and TOWER and SIDEWALK RECORDS!). I mean, what's up with You Guys anyway. I just don't get it People, what their doing, to tell you the truth! When you see the logo of the EMI emblem, there's a World behind it. Just hope it's not an other Government or World conspiracy. Boy, that's all we need. I give up! P. S. I DON'T HAVE ANY VOTES YET BEATLES FANS, WHAT'S THE MATTER, SCARED!!!!!!!!!!

That's the way the Beatles were made to sound!..............or............... EMI?......... is Syd right? Your employees living at that time? It kind of makes you wonder why EMI (Capital), and a host of others, not to produce an Album to Groups that didn't make the Grade on a single then other labels, I mean, The Side Walk Skipper Band! WOW! For the People not Voting on Me! Keep studying the Quanity and Price on Your Right, Will Ya!! That's the Used Section Ben From Albums and CDs Stores Coast to Coast! That gives You a sign of RETURNING PRODUCTS right their! Maybe theirs a lot of You that were not born at that time when this Music came Out! HA? Lots of Bandwagons! Because You know Why? When this Music came out back then, it sounded  25 to 35 Times better than whats on this CD! BIG P.S., I've got the Psychedelic Colorized Cover Version of Revolver Album, and NOT the One that's on the Yahoo Image that's been Photo Shopped! Not to Many Made! And the Song, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" has the Seagulls and Guitars sound like their CIRCLING on the Headphones, and the Album is NOT Quadrophnoic either! Also, their's FOUR extra SONGS on the Album as well, that's how far I'll go with that! So, YOU figure that one OUT BEATLES FANS!!!!!!!!! a \\"$1.19\\"????? Lowest Price So Far!!!
B004SEUJKU|5.0|\\"The Terminator\\" - This film has, perhaps, the best scriptwriting ever for a Sci-Fi film. As well, the elegantly simple opening scene is the most attention getting opening scene I've seen in my 67years. This 'high concept' but 'everyday circumstances' story invites the audience to see themselves in the action. This is an adult film that appeals to childhood fantasies in all of us.
B000002GA8|3.0|It sounded great, and if i'm not mistaken, broadcasted on 95.5 KLOS FM. So, went to Wallecks Music City in Lakewood, Calif., and bought the album. Not the same, to bad. Video machines back then, don't think they had Bata in 1974, where real expensive. P.S. The guy that was saying something about that Red Cap he was waring, SO WHAT! I'm mean what's your problem about that anyway?  This was the time when Alice Copper, Black Sabbath, and I do believe that new Group Kiss was just breaking out at that time. Maybe Rick done that because HE seen what was going on in the future! The bottom line is this! Rick and Ion ( Yep, that's His true Born Name! ) couldn't stand each other! A lot of FIGHTS AND PROBLEMS, and I know your mad about that, but that's how it goes! COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006IND5M8|4.0|I would give it a good movie rating. It was a bit different but had plenty of action, short on dialogue any movie with Harrison Ford is worth watching for me.
B005OZE9SA|3.0|I've had this for about 2 or 3 months and have used it for some portable recording and for some quick stuff at home.<br /><br />Today I finally had a chance to test it vs. my old MBox 2 because I suspected something and my suspicions were confirmed: the headphone amp is much quieter than on other interfaces.  I took the same session and set my master fader at the same level, and listened to the session with my Scarlett 2i2 and then closed and opened the session with my MBox 2 as the interface, and I could get about twice as much gain out of the headphones with the MBox 2.<br /><br />Why does this matter?  Because when I'm recording, I like to turn up the headphones as loud as possible for a second to check for background noise and changes in tone/timbre while setting up mic positions.<br /><br />With the Scarlett, I simply can't get loud enough with acoustic instruments to be able to hear all the ambient noise and select the best mic position.  So yeah, it's a good beginner interface.  In my case, the cost was offset by the fact that now I have to get a headphone amp or something to boost the signal so I can still maintain my same workflow.

B006M9NI48|1.0|The author constantly misuses the word 'covet', which seems pretty silly as it is a very common word.<br /><br />Also there doesn't seem to be anything original or clever here, just a regurgitation of all the 'get rich quick', propaganda that has been hawked at seminars and things like them for decades and probably centuries.<br /><br />The author describes their experience of needing some fast cash and deciding to get it by plagiarizing another book which tells people that they can get rich quick by doing nothing but wishing or 'believing'.<br /><br />Obviously it worked for the author but how ethical is this? There seem to be parallels to the way that pyramid scams are marketed. Sure the cost is less as it is only a book, but does that make it ethical?

B004QOB8SO|5.0|While Season One of BBC's SHERLOCK was insanely entertaining, incredibly intelligent, and remarkably well-acted, just three episodes wasn't enough. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss did an extraordinary thing with the iconic tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: They MODERNIZED it. While that isn't a particularly remarkable thing in and of itself, what REALLY is extraordinary about this series is that the modernization WORKED flawlessly.<br /><br />This season (which just ended last night in the U.S. being broadcast on PBS with some rather controversial editing since apparently eight minutes of each episode had to be chopped off to make room for PBS advertising) was not just better than the first season, it was more involving from a character standpoint. We got a much better glimpse into the souls of Sherlock Holmes (the wonderful Benedict Cumberbatch, who is rapidly becoming one of the hardest working men in Hollywood as well) and his faithful companion Dr. John Watson (the equally great Martin Freeman). The wonderful thing that this show has done since its inception has been to not marginalize the friendship between Holmes and Watson, but also not marginalizing Watson himself. While he is in constant awe of Holmes' remarkable deductive skills, he's also his own man and not the plump, blundering buffoonish character of old adaptations, and he makes important contributions to each case.<br /><br />This season does only give us three more episodes, but each episode is essentially one feature-length film. The first episode is the best of the entire series yet, \\"A Scandal In Belgravia\\", which introduces this incarnation of Sherlock Holmes to the character of Irene Adler, who casual fans of the detective have seen as portrayed by Rachel McAdams in both of the Downey Jr./Law SHERLOCK HOLMES films. She is originally, as portrayed in Guy Ritchie's entertaining films, an American who moves to Europe and becomes a \\"courtesan\\" who is something of a foil and love interest for Holmes. In this episode though, Adler (Lara Pulver of MI-5) is a dominatrix who has enough secrets on her mobile phone to practically bring down the entirety of England. She enters into something of a game of obsession with Holmes. This game does bring other players, naturally, and soon Holmes is looking at something much larger. Cumberbatch and Pulver bring a very heightened sense of sexual tension to their scenes together, as Holmes feels something more for this woman than for any other woman in his life. Although, I have to say that arguably my favorite part in this episode is where we see how strong the bonds are between Holmes and his maternal landlady Mrs. Hudson (the wonderful Una Stubbs). The message is clear: Don't mess with the friends of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Then comes \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\", which is the least of this season. A troubled young man comes to Holmes and Watson with the tale of a gigantic hound that killed his father years before in the countryside area of Dartmoor. At first, Holmes is astonishingly bored with the idea of this case, but something the young man says specifically pricks up his ears and the game is afoot. Also in Dartmoor is a government research facility called Baskerville, where apparently many secret experiments are being done, including genetic research. Could there be a military experiment of the creation of a huge dog? Is the explanation more complex even than that? There were many things to love about this episode, with one of my favorite moments being that of Holmes trying to quit smoking and references a \\"seven percent solution\\", but this was the only episode when I felt like I was ahead of Holmes and exactly what was happening and how it was happening. It still works and it is still very entertaining, particularly Cumberbatch's performance as he first truly feels the effects of fear and panic for perhaps the first time in his life.<br /><br />Finally, we have \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\", which is a reference to the finalconfrontation between Holmes and his arch-nemesis James Moriarty. This episode, like the finale of the first season \\"The Great Game\\", is extremely dark and foreboding, as well it should be since you can't really have a light-hearted take on the mental combat between Holmes and Moriarty (played with flamboyant and psychotic relish by Andrew Scott). There's nothing I really want to say about this episode that can do it justice, but it's incredibly smart, incredibly tense and incredibly disturbing.<br /><br />The other thing that the show has been so brilliant at doing is giving a more realistic (and more modern) take on the friendship between Holmes and Watson. It never tries to imply that they are more than friends, but the hordes of readers and critics of the Holmes/Watson partnership over the decades have done enough examinations of their own to come to the illogical conclusion that Holmes and Watson are lovers. These people are repeatedly poked fun at via the voice of Watson as he reads or hears or sees people who see the two of them as lovers, which is a bit of a running gag throughout the season, and Freeman plays it perfectly with just the right mixture of offense and incredulity. The other primary relationship here is that of Sherlock's relationship with his brother Mycroft (played by Mark Gatiss). Their relationship is strained beyond repair, but there's something touching about Mycroft's concern for his younger brother while at the same time, as in \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", where Mycroft knows his brother's incapability to work within the confines of normal society.<br /><br />It's always a joy to see a program about extremely intelligent people that is created by extremely intelligent people. While I've never been a fan of DOCTOR WHO, I was extremely impressed with Moffat's updating of the Jekyll/Hyde tale in the series JEKYLL with the great James Nesbitt.<br /><br />SHERLOCK will have \\"competition\\" soon on U.S. television as the upcoming CBS series ELEMENTARY with Johnny Lee Miller as Holmes and Lucy Liu as Watson (?) in yet another update, but apparently with the added attraction of doing some gender-bending. If this is anything like all the other procedural mysteries on CBS, it will probably be hugely successful from a ratings standpoint, but will be a massive creative failure. But it might well get people interested in this series, and that might just be good enough.confrontation between Holmes and his arch-nemesis James Moriarty.

B00002R0MC|5.0|I bought this as my first reggae music CD, so I am not a reggae officiando. I'm a drummer and my goal was to listen to variations of reggae beats, after purchasing Gil Sharon's \\"Wicked Beats\\" instructional DVD - which BTW I highly recommend to any musician.<br /><br />This CD spans from Marley's early solo works with accoustic guitar to later multipiece band arrangements.  I found the music enjoyable and relaxing (no surprise there) and well produced. Quality of later recordings is understandably better overall than earlier ones.  Lots of songs on each disk, lots of value for the set, so I was quite satisfied.

B0014KFV6I|5.0|The acquisition of this album (I owned it in LP form and played it through my high school and college years) was especially well timed - it coincided with the release of Carole King's biography and her associated rounds of the talk show circuit. King is among the most gifted of the songwriters and performers of my youth and it's a real pleasure to listen to her premiere album. For devotees, there's a bonus track that just adds to the pleasure.

1469984202|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this series of books compiled into one purchase.  The story was a bit slow for me at first, but once I became invested in the characters and plot, I could hardly put it down.  I thought that the author interview at the end of the book was hilarious.  I have read another book by the same author (Book 1 in the Molly Fyde Series) and was not disappointed.  I have purchased several other books by Hugh Howey and eagerly look forward to reading them all.  Check him out at [...].

It takes some time to get used to, but once you get the hang of it your modeling speed will really increase.  I even managed to convince my 'penny pinching' fried to get one within 10 mins of use!<br /><br />The base of the device acts like a suction cup to your desk and keeps it from moving.

I immediately liked the idea of the KEY NOTES, but I decided to start with the `praise' page first.  Then, of course, I needed to see the `dedication', and the `prologue'.  I didn't stop there--I needed to see everything!  Did I mention that I didn't give my daughter an opportunity to see the book for the next 4 hours?  It is well written, informative, and enjoyable.  I highly recommend The $100 Startup.

The battery to the camera was not in stock at any store that I shopped at. Also, the battery was anywhere from $10-18 more in the stores that could order it for me. I ordered from Amazon and received it very quickly, which I needed for vacation. Amazon service is unsurpassed by any!  The battery is very expensive, but then again, so was the camera!!

I was most excited to hear the difference in the remastering. Often remastering brings a new vibrance to these older cds. Unfortunately, the sound is EXACTLY THE SAME, so the only reason to buy it is the live dvd.  Great cd none the less
B0040HO16S|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford: The Complete Season One is a charming series that tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivis Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in 1996's Pride and Prejudice. Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.<br /><br />There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store love prying into others' affairs; postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) gets entangled in romance; Queenie and Twister Turrill are an older eccentric couple residing in Lark Rise; and many more. This is truly a gem of a series, and I am hopelessly addicted to it. Each episode is well-crafted and credibly acted, drawing viewers into the lives of these mostly endearing & flawed characters, and making one feel at home in both Lark Rise and Candleford.

B00170MYIS|4.0|This battery is MUCH better compared to the BG series of batteries that Sony makes, mainly because it holds a longer charge, AND it displays the remaining time left on the camera whether it's shooting video or pictures.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I tried putting this battery into my HX30V camera, and it wouldn't go in properly. Come to find out, when I finally got it in there, the battery was stuck! I had to use some super glue to pull it out, and I took off all the labels and now the battery works fine. Not 100% sure I got a genuine Sony battery, but at least it has no problems now even though there's no labels on it.<br /><br />Just keep in mind that if you get this battery, make sure that it goes into your camera properly without any problems.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give this less than 1 star, I would. Perhaps half a star. This is one of the worst books I have ever read, possibly the worst. Ana has zero redeeming qualities, and her inexperience (both sexually and in life) is improbable and unrealistic. A supposedly attractive college senior who has never really kissed anyone? Really? And she doesn't have a computer? Really?<br /><br />And the writing. Holy f***, the writing. I don't know how many times the phrase \\"my inner goddess\\" is in this book, nor do I want to, because I'd have to read it again to count. Every time that phrase came up, I wanted to throw something. If I hadn't borrowed a friend's Kindle to read this, I would have. And then there were the constant descriptions of Christian. Do I always need to know what he's wearing? No. Do I constantly need to be told that his pants are hanging \\"in that way?\\" No, a) I don't care, and b) \\"in that way\\" is a ridiculous phrase. I don't need to know what Ana's always wearing, either. I specifically don't need to know what brand sneakers she's wearing, but thanks, E.L. James, for letting me know she likes Converse. (Normal people who wear them usually call them Chucks.) And on the subject of description, what 21 year old still uses the phrase \\"down there\\" for her vagina? There are so many others words or phrases that could have been used that wouldn't have made me think \\"is she really in college, or is she in junior high?\\" Why not just have her call it her no-no spot and have her truly seem like a child?<br /><br />Seriously, this book sucks, y'all. That said, I have put the next two on hold at work so I can read them. Appropriately, I had the same feeling about the Twilight series. I just finished it because I felt like I *should* after reading the first one. (That series at least had Alice, and I like her.) I hope one day someone writes a paper on the ways in which this series and Twilight are similar so we can read it and say \\"oh, I didn't notice that.\\" This book islike a train wreck. I couldn't tear myself away. I don't get the people who keep saying it's a hot, sexy book. I've read books that were way hotter and way sexier; this book is neither.<br /><br />I think I've worked out a good percentage for the make-up of the book: 0.25% very mild S&M, 15.75% rough sex, and 84% Twilight.
0446691437|1.0|This book is very short. That would be ok if it were good. Instead, it is self-indulgent fluff. It seems more like a painfully long poem than a book, wherein the author describes what he calls Resistance- writer's block, more or less- in flowery language. It reads as a stream of consciousness, as if he wrote down his thoughts over the course of an hour or two (perhaps while drunk) and then published them without even reading over them. He posits that liking salty and sugary foods is a symptom of Resistance, and that alienating friends and family is a sign of having tapped into one's creativity- people are just jealous, and trying to drag him back down to the status quo. The author also seems to believe that most or all sickness is either caused by having a trapped creative force, or trying to sabotage people from achieving creative success. My overall impression was that he needed medical and/or psychiatric attention, as he seems to be experiencing a loosening of associations and mild delusional thinking. I'm disappointed- this came recommended at the end of the Biali Pimps, which I loved. I got more out of the foreword than the rest of the book.

Very poor editing and slow storytelling, hard to stay with it, I've put it on pause about 10 times already to take breaks as there is no real suspense to hold my attention.  I'm a theater director.  I know my craft.  Beautiful visual vehicle for Ratcliffe, but nothing more.
B0060JCBHK|5.0|Got this book in great condition and early!  I just started reading it. I find it compelling and very well written. We are reading it in my book club and so far everyone is glad we put this on our list!.
0345803485|1.0|Where to start?  With a confession...one of the reasons I foolishly spent $10 on this so-called book was because most of my co-workers were reading it and monopolizing the conversation in the lunchroom for days on end.  Remember how your parents warned you not to do something simply because \\"everyone else\\" was?  They were so right!<br /><br />This book never should have been written in the first person. A character cannot say, \\"I blushed scarlet,\\" because, unless you are looking in a mirror, you cannot see yourself when you blush.  If the author had really needed to repeat that idea ad nauseum, it ought to have been along the lines of, \\"My face felt so hot that I imagined it must look scarlet.\\"  That is Writing 101.<br /><br />The other sticking point for me (from the very start) was...why did Kate even ask Ana to interview Christian when Ana did not work for the school paper?  Simply because they were roommates?  That makes about as much sense as a girl who was a virgin suddenly turning into an acrobat in the bedroom!  Or getting a job right out of college after only one interview with the company!  Holy (fill in the blank)...there was absolutely nothing to like about Ana.  She made Christian look good in comparison, although it pains me to say that.  Pun intended.<br /><br />Let me amend the comment above to say this book never should have been written at all.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wow. Great find from an author I had not heard of before. Excellent sci-fi and plenty of action ... I hated to stop reading and couldn't wait to get back to it. I thought the story and characters were terrific, and the writing very good.
0345803485|1.0|I read the  Anne Rice erotic novel \\"Exit to Eden\\" in the 1990's and read E.L James \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\". Exit to Eden was soo much better. Fifty was tame where Exit was intense. Fifty is like erotica lite. Anne Rice has experienced, consenting adults of the same age in Exit. This is much sexier than the worn out older man seduces the younger woman blah, blah, blah. This book is awful. Here is me an American, using a British-ism, \\"It is RUBBISH.\\" I was forced to rate this book one star, I would have preferred zero.  I work in a bookstore and now couple weeks after I wrote this, I see a pattern among Fifty Shades customers. Those who love the book, are not \\"readers\\", those who hate it are. Avid readers saw the book for what it is, juvenile level erotica. They must have enough experience reading all types of books and can spot crap when they read it. Non readers are more \\"movie people\\".

Not gonna give away any of the details don't wanna ruin it like other people do giving to much info but just gonna say if you like action this is the movie to see. How anyone could not like it is beyond me and they must be really hard to satisfy or hard to please if they didn't like it. Loved this movie I would give it 10 stars.

0345803485|1.0|I am a 22 year old female and I downloaded all 3 books to my Kindle on a whim based on a few rave reviews I heard. I finished the first book just barely, and I'm halfway through the second.<br />It is so unbelievably repetitive that I actually feel guilty for taking an hour out of my day to waste my time and read this crap.<br />The story just seems so gimmicky and unrealistic. Ana's character is first \\"developed\\" as a simple and plain girl and suddenly becomes the subject of Christian Grey's over-the-top obsession? Why? Her character does absolutely nothing for me and so far I find her to be whiny. Wow, she must be one lucky girl to go from virgin one day to a total temptress the next! If the sex scenes were at all realistic, they'd have a small chance of being erotic. I know little to no women who can orgasm that quickly and that often. Lets be real.<br /><br />Lastly: Because I am the same age as Anastasia Steele is supposed to be, its even more painful for me to read. You can tell a 40-something year old woman is trying really hard to make Ana's character sound like what she thinks a 22-year old female would be like today. Ana's character truly sounds like a 40 year old is living inside of her. Quotes like \\"Jeez,\\" \\"Aye Aye Captain,\\" \\"double crap\\" and \\"Scared the daylights out of me\\" sounds like my mother.  A perhaps less relate-able complaint is that the music the author has \\"playing\\" throughout the book is laughable. Toxic by Britney Spears? Beyonce? Blehhh no thanks.<br />So here's what I take from it thus far: Both characters are so incredibly irresistible to each other for reasons I can't identify, immense product placement, Ana's new \\"temptress\\" character and incredibly tacky dialogue dont match up. Waste of $30 for the pack. Deleting off my kindle today to make room for some real literature. I literally feel like my I.Q. dropped significantly after this read.
B00004RYJB|5.0|I bought this DVD because it is stated in the details section that the DVD has danish subtitles. The DVD that was sent to me had only dutch, portuguese and english subtitles. I can't blame the movie for that, so I have to give this intensely funny movie five stars anyway. But make sure you get a DVD with the proper subtitles if that is important to you.
B003AWRMCE|2.0|How sad. One of the best films ever. I purchased this film with great anticipation. It arrived on time, in perfect condition, until I played it. This is the worst film quality I have ever seen. Grainy, blurry, terrible lighting contrast. It amazes me that a corporation with the rights to selling dvds so highly acclaimed would ruin their reputation and insult their customers by having the greed and, to their shame, the lack of intigrity, to distribute such garbage. Save your money. Don't buy this dvd...it is too lousy to even try to watch.
1607885719|2.0|After a dozen dazzling best sellers, David Baldacci has finally let me down. This story does not have the pizzazz of the Camel club or his other brilliant pairings. The pace is lacking and the characters lack the usual Baldacci hutzpah. Until now every book has been a crescendo of delight, even Zero Hour, which Lee Child seemed to be imitating.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!! I hope Hugh does another one. Throughout the whole album, everyone sounds like they are having fun. I love the way Hugh kept these songs sounding old and new at the same time. He has a great voice and wonderful musical talent. I really do hope he does another album.
B002C949AE|5.0|Very interesting.  Tells life and the problems of women in that part of Africa as it really is. I highly recommend reading this book.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Awesome book.  Exceeded my expectations by far.  You will not regret buying this book.  Can't wait for the next one!
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is a wonderful well-written book regarding e-publishing. I have read several books on the subject and this one is one that I definitely recommend. It is simple and to the point. It will provide with an overview of what is required to become an Indy author. Plus it is so inspiring. If you have lost hope as a writer, you need to read this book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Like farmville. simple but you will have to wait for energy.  But hey it's free so what can you expect.
B002ZG994U|4.0|So even tho it took about 2 weeks for the movie to get here, but its a really good movie, i got a used version an its in good shape, i personally think this is one of the best action movies!
B007MAETA8|5.0|This album is a true masterpiece,destined to be a classic. As with all great albums, becomes much richer with repeated listenings, as the colors and flavors come together into a rich cohesive work of art.
B000002VMD|5.0|Love all the songs on this CD. I don't need to watch the DVD as the songs brings back memories of the film. Whitney Houston was a brilliant singer.
0451232577|2.0|Front of book was in pretty rough shape and can not be uncurled. The rest of the book is fine and the story is great!
0345803485|1.0|I had heard that this series was all the rage, and I was really excited to read it......It was AWFUL. I really really tried to get through it, thinking there has to be more than this, there just has to. The writing was terribly shallow and the descriptors were as though a ninth grader wrote them.<br /><br />The author repeated the same 3 phrases at least 50 times by chapter 6...seriously! Shame, I was looking for a Sookie and Eric type story and got a 5th rate bella and edward imitation.<br /><br />Readers beware, I wasted three days trying to force myself through this book and i'll never get that time back.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these games are a lot of fun and I really like that you have to earn points to unlock new games. some are quite challenging!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry bird is the most fun game ever. if you say it stinks you are wrong. this is epicness ok.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This isn't a romance and it isn't erotica. It's simply a desperate and failed attempt at writing. This author knows nothing about story structure, rising anticipation or satisfying sex. Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Bonnie a long time favorite of mine does it again, a bit different than some of her recordings but I liked it alot!!!!!!!
0307346617|4.0|I'm a fan of zombie movies, or to be more specific I'm a fan of the first HALF of zombie movies. The first thirty or so minutes of a zombie flick when the world goes from as constructed & settled to mad brain chomping, intestine ripping, fending off your now ravenous husband & children with a rusty shovel absolute pandemonium are the most exhilarating fun I'm capable of having at the theatre. Eventually though, the person through whom we are witnessing the undead apocalypse escapes, meets up with other survivors and they inevitably decide to hole up in a house, a military base, a mall etc until help arrives. Sometimes it does, usually it doesn't but by that time the tension has dissipated and I'm too bored and uninvested to really care. This problem has plagued all the zombie movies I've seen, even the really good ones. The Walking Dead is an excellent comic & program that looks to explore the dynamics of one such group by fleshing out the typical zombie flick archetypes with more attention to character and detail, but as good as it is, the truth is that even well written characters get boring when all they're left to do is wax philosophical about the end of the world until the next encounter with the undead.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that World War Z avoided (most) of these pitfalls. Written by Max Brooks, author of 'The Zombie Survival Guide' and something of a zombie fanatic, World War Z (guess what the Z is for) doesn't attempt to rewrite the typical zombie narrative but instead of focusing on the trials and terrors particular to one group of survivors (usually North American,) Brooks writes from the perspective of a whole array of people of differing races, nationalities & religions from all across the globe. From rural China (the origin of this book universe's undead outbreak) to India, Israel, The United Kingdom, The Andes Mountains of Chile, Russia, Japan, under water and even from Outer Space. The book itself is semi-Meta, written in the form of a book that seeks to interview a variety of individuals from all different walks of life & document their experiences in the now (mostly) finished zombie war. CIA Agents, Israeli spies, Mongolian smugglers, Russian soldiers, Japanese cyberpunks, Air Force pilots and lots of plain garden variety citizens each take turns telling their stories from their particular perspectives and vantage points, all during different stages of the global zombie outbreak. The result is you aren't bogged down and potentially bored with the perspective of just one person or group, but are essentially viewing (err reading) 11 or 12 different zombies. The ability to concentrate on just the interesting parts keeps the narrative fresh and all the varied narratives from different sections of society & the world creates a patchwork effect that allows the reader to see the Zombie Outbreak not just on a micro but on a Macro scale I.E. The decisions world leaders end up making when confronted with the dead returning to life, how it affects their citizens and how it affects their relations with other countries.<br /><br />The book is not without flaws (you're kidding!). Brooks has to inhabit a number of different characters from different countries & differing personalities and paint their experiences as believable and he mostly succeeds in this regard. Writing from the perspective of someone from a different country and socio-economic background, who speaks a different language, practices a different religion and is sometimes a different gender isn't easy. While some of the characters are quite lovingly & meticulously portrayed others are unfortunately little better than cliches & sterotypes, the British and many of the Russian characters in particular were particularly corny & eye-roll inducing. I was also a little bit let down that he didn't put more focus on the international level and the ways in which the zombie outbreak would impact International relations, both between allies and adversaries, which is something the first half of the book briefly delves into, but doesn't really follow through with on the last half.<br /><br />This is the written equivalent of an action movie, though one artfully executred so be prepared for a fair share of cornball moments, but in general a good read.
B00785P2QC|2.0|So, I've had this game for a while. I've built a substantial city and I love being able to fiddle around with my city when I have nothing going on.<br />However, recently, every time I load the game up, it gets stuck in the loading screen and when it finally does load, my entire city is on fire and I'm gaining achievements I'm positive I've already received. It's extremely irritating to have to upgrade the same buildings every time I play. And at least three of my buildings are always destroyed and abandoned.<br />This does not encourage me to play. In fact, I'm considering uninstalling it for good.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|This movie was very good and I give it 5 stars.  One reviewer rated 3 because it jumps from year to year, back and forth but that made the anticipation of the ending better.  I will be buying the book now.
1613771355|2.0|It looks like Amazon quickly changed the description above. But when I preordered this back in October 2011, not only did the release date change often, but the title said \\"SIGNED AND NUMBERED\\". That's what made me buy the book in the first place. Not to mention I thought it was going to be the actual book and not the comic book, which I already have two copies of.<br /><br />This book is great, however (which has nothing to with Amazon). The cover is gorgeous and it's larger than the other edition. But it was falsely advertised as signed and number by Amazon and I really don't appreciate getting something that I waited MONTHS for, only to be let down. My problem here is NOT with the book, as it is wonderful and beautiful, but with Amazon. I feel like I should get a bit of my money back considering I was lied to.<br /><br />Thanks a lot, Amazon.
1439181780|4.0|quite an interesting book,still coming to grips with some of the info,seems a bit too simple ,all these things i have achieved ,but not by wishing and hoping ,am sure a positive attitude has a lot to do with it ,but this book seems to make it sound like an aladins cave that is there for the asking,i think this is going a bit too far
B001E45XT4|4.0|These are really awesome for the price.  The sound quality is good, I get no complaints about the mic, and the construction seems surprisingly solid (again, given the price).  The one complain I have is that I have a rather large head, and these get uncomfortable after an hour or so.  I'm not sure if it's the actualy size of my head... it seems like there's just not enough room inside the cups for my ears (the edges of my ears get kind of sore).<br /><br />Again, though... the price.<br /><br />Sweet, sweet cheapness.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The season of the show is fantastic (both literally and figuratively). It's well-cast, well-scripted, and remains largely faithful to the source material. It reminds me of a combination of \\"Braveheart\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings.\\" If that sounds like something you'd like, please check it out. If you are averse to nudity, however, it's best to seek other entertainment.
B005K17RU0|4.0|What a handy little app that does everything you could ask it to do for everyday consultation. Rain or shine you will be prepped for the day or the week!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I just had to see what all the fuss was about and went ahead & paid the $9.99 (yikes) and got Book One.  I didn't realize until later that it was Twilight fanfiction (I should have known)!  It was fun to read but the repetitiveness got annoying and her \\"inner goddess\\" was just too juvenile for me.  I won't be reading the other two books.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game by far is one of the most fun games for the Kindle Fire, and a bit addictive...LOL...especially for FREE! The graphics are awesome and even my grandkids love to play! The only Angry Birds that's better than this so far is the Angry Birds Space HD. Thanks to the makers!!
0345803485|2.0|I am not going to go into the in's and out's of this book but irritated me from the start. The story line has the potential for greatness if it were in the hands of a competent erotia novelist (thing Joan Elizabeth Lloyd). However E.L. James is completely inept as a writer. She is extremely repetitive. Every time I read the word \\"murmured\\" being used in unfitting situations made me want to throw the book across the room. Every time she talked about \\"blood pooling in her stomach\\", I though \\"Oh thank God, he is killing her\\".<br /><br />Also, when writing an erotic novel you have to have the ability to say something other than \\"there\\" and \\"down there\\" when referring to your female sex organ. Just say it.... vagina!<br /><br />This book is so poorly written that I want to scream. Give this James a dictionary and a thesaurus and tell her to bother publishing anything else until she as a better grasp of the vastness of the English language.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this book is the cover art. I am actually ashamed to buy something so awfully written. I love erotica and there are so many good authors out there, but James isn't on of them. Maybe for people who dropped out of school when they were 13 and don't remember a thing about grammer, this is a good book. But for we, the educated, it is... As Ana says... \\"CRAP!\\"
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a great game. The graphics are amazing on my Kindle Fire and the game is free. I've gone on to purchase all of the other Angry Birds games and I'm not disappointed with any of them. Angry Birds Space HD is probably one of their best. I would recommend this game to anyone. Thanks to the makers!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|most amazing game ever ! i almost didnt get it because i hate lepruchauns ...but im sooo happy i did. its just like mario!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just found this book by accident and read it pretty much in one sitting, stopping only to sleep. It is an amazing book and I absolutely can not wait for the movie!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love this album. I've been watching Adam Lambert since he was on Idol. I was amazed by his singing and performing abilities while he was on the show, but, now - a little more than 3 years later - he's just awesome.<br /><br />This album is like the difference between Adele's first and second albums. Phenomenal.<br /><br />I also love how creative Adam was in selecting the songs for this album. Light and dark. Double entendres all over the place. Awesome.
0345803485|5.0|This book is definitely for not the \\"faint of heart.\\" It is very discriptive and discusses things many people have not even probably have heard of or maybe have only seen or heard of once in their lives. I can't tell you how many things I had to look up on Wikipedia! Haha. But I'm telling you, ladies...it definitely gets you going, if you know what I mean. It is a very exciting, nerve-racking book (as are the other two). Christian Grey has got to be the sexiest character ever written! I cannot wait to see the movie adaptation of this book. I hope it is done well and follows the book as closely as possible. In my opinion, I think Henry Cavill should play Christian Grey. He's who I imagine as the sexy, billionaire, BDSM-obsessed, greek god look-alike. *fans self*
B0013F1D02|5.0|Amazingly beautiful movie still, even in 2012. I can't believe I miss it in 2007.  Wonderful story, beautiful casting, superb acting, Robert DeNiro, wow, man, is he  versatile.  And the music, its perfect.  Get the soundtrack, it's worth every penny.  This movie is a classic on my list.
B000P46QIG|5.0|Who are these regular people?  These would be the regular people that say my reviews aren't helpful.  I am a huge fan of Planet X.  Planet X is one of those bands that if a regular person hears them expect, \\"Turn that xxxx down!\\"  I have been a fan of them since they started, and I will probably always hold them in high regard.  Quantum is perhaps Planet X's best album to date.  It goes without say that with players like these that Planet X is going to put out nothing but the highest quality music.  Really, Planet X is a contemporary jazz band, and one of the few that have actually gained a following in my generation.  If you want a pop album, then that is not what you will get with Quantum though the song writing is superb.  If you want to fit in, good luck if you listen to Planet X.  In fact, if you play this for your friends, expect to be an outcast.  Why?  Because your average Joe is not educated in music and falls for a bunch of tricks, but there are no tricks on Quantum, just music at its finest.  Going to a Planet X show is like attending a church where music quality is first and foremost.  Yes, there is far more to this album than chops, as though their needs to be some skill to play chops, but Quantum also has a complexity, such that a rest in the music says just as much as a note.
B0071BY1CO|5.0|3D de una excelente calidad en esta segunda entrega para esta historia... ojala y se animen por la tercera parte pronto...
B0036S4CTS|5.0|Absolutely devastating. It's \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" in a more experimental form with more tender imagery. Love it and can't wait to read more Nicholls.
159514188X|3.0|I won't tell you what this book is about, because you probably already know. And if you don't, I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />Most of the reviews I've read are along the lines of, \\"This book has changed my life,\\" or, \\"This book has made me want to be a better person.\\" And that's fine. If reading this book makes you more careful about how you treat other people, that's great. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a nicer person.<br /><br />However, there IS something wrong with abdicating all responsibility for your own life, and allowing other people to determine your fate. It has been said that you can't control what happens to you -- you can only control how you REACT to what happens to you, and I agree with that. It's dangerous to sit back and blame other people for everything that happens. To say, \\"Well, I can't be a success in life because my parents did such and such.\\" Or, \\"Somebody hurt my feelings. I might as well give up.\\" So what? You're in control of your own life -- nobody else.<br /><br />My daughter, a seventh-grader, knows to be nice to people. But she also knows that what she makes of her life is her decision to make, nobody else's. She won't be a victim.<br /><br />I read this book after my daughter checked it out of the library, and she and I will be having a long discussion about it. I want to make sure she understands that while life can be difficult, things usually get better with time. Sure, some bad things happened to Hannah. But is there anyone out there to whom NOTHING bad has happened? Hannah needed to pull up her big girl pants and deal.<br /><br />I get that it's a great concept for a book, but I think it's dangerous to plant the seed that if your life is difficult, the least you can do is be dramatic about it on your way out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great for killing time and its a great way to try to keep on track with things needed to do.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Gangstar is great, reminds me of gta 3, with better graphics and storyline. love the guns, love the cars, and I love messing with the cops. other then having a startup issue, or crashing during a cutscene every now and then, its a great game, I would have been willing to pay more
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The games are mind hobbling and challenging...Once u meet the first level of points....then it becomes very challenging to get the second level.... when I read the reviews before downloading on my kindle fire about the ads problem...I started not to download the game because of that....I'm glad I did...the ads are very small and low..it doesn't affect the game playing...I would recommend this game to my friends...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had to read the book before seeing the movie so bought the trilogy.  Then I just couldn't put it down and read straight through.  Fantasticly written, poinient, thought provoking, exciting.  It really takes you through the emotions of coming of age and sometimes having to take on more adult issues than you are ever ready to tackle.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Recommend you buy the whole triology pack rather than each book that costed more! At end of every book you want to know what happens in the next one..... Good read.
B007MAETA8|3.0|Being as fair as I can be for someone who has been to eight concerts and owns pretty much every piece of his released work and more, I would have to say that this is not John's best work. Before anyone gets into the hissyfit about \\"growing as an artist\\", let me stop you there and say that I completely agree that no artist should ever stay stagnant and exploration is truly the best way one can express one's creativity. That being said, I don't know how to really feel about the trajectory of these past two albums.<br /><br />If we follow the course charted out by his earliest work, Room for Squares, we see that even through the folky adolescent angst of a young man's lyrics, we hear the underpinnings of an artist setting himself to wade in the deep waters of a Blues Revival movement (i.e. City Love and Neon). In interview after interview he had always talked about making Blues music more accessible. With Heavier Things, he continued to push this agenda forward with songs like Come Back to Bed and to a degree, Daughters. At this point, if you're lucky enough to attend the live shows, the long Bluesy solos should clue you into what direction he's gravitating towards.<br /><br />To solidify this argument I present to you, The John Mayer Trio. All out, no apologies, I don't give a funk BLUES! Truly an amazing album and concert series. Many of the younger fans ignored it, but for those of us waiting for what seemed like a grand inevitability, it was quite the epiphany. Armed with the fuel of this experimental album, he went back to the studio and gave what many consider his greatest work, Continuum. With this album, I believe he achieved what he set out to do all along; producing pop-centered tunes with a ooey gooey Bluesy center. To me, it was the pinnacle of his music career.<br /><br />So, deciding that he wouldn't try to top that, he chose to change directions in the form of Battle Studies, an album that seemed lacking in the writing department and played too heavily to its retro California style pop theme. While it's hard to go wrong with John's great vocals, the album itself seemed to be mostly forgettable. There isn't really one song on the album that has ever stopped me in my tracks the way that 3x5 has, or tugged at my heart strings the way Slow Dancing in a Burning Room has.<br /><br />And now comes Born and Raised, which is an even deeper departure from those beloved Blues sensibilities. It's almost as if he's turned his back on it completely, and replaced it with a very lazy sounding album that, while trying to remain true to some semblance of a theme, muddies the beginning of one track with the end of another. After five or six listens, I don't know that any of these songs make me feel anything but indifference. Again, the voice is great. If you can't get enough of John's warm embracing vocals, you'll buy this album. It's hard not to like at least a few songs of any one album, and you could definitely leave it on in the background while you're at work or relaxing from a hard day at work. But is that really what we had hoped for from John, since the we were blessed with the energy and soulfulness of Continuum.<br /><br />Honestly, it feels like a betrayal of sorts. Many of us have followed him down a path that we believed would lead to something great. And it did! But then, at the height of all of this finely tuned writing, powerful singing and downright kickass guitar playing, he pulled the rug from under us and decided that he was done with all that. He's moved on and has left many of us wondering if maybe we should do the same.<br /><br />John's said different things throughout the years in terms of where he wanted his future albums to go. At one time, he said Continuum would be more of a classic R&B style, which I think it had some elements of, but not enough to considered truly R&B. How great would it be if he could take that Blues sentimentality and throw in some R&B style vocals. That's what I'm waiting for. Whatever Born and Raised is, it's commendable and it's palatable, but far from anything I would call great.<br /><br />UPDATE: After many months of repeated listening, I definitely have a greater appreciation of the album. It is definitely a mood setting album. You will either need to be in the mood for it, or it will put you in one. This is not to say that I am negating anything I had said earlier. There's a raw power and energy that I found in Continuum and John Mayer Trio that is still lacking here. But it's not so bad.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Books in a series have a lot to live up to if the initial book is well received. This book is no different. It is interesting and expands on the initial Hunger Games book, but falls well short of the expected results. Part of this in my opinion has to do with the depth of the concept and the arena layout. The extreme intricacies can only go so far and are even worse in book three. I have to say that I was appalled at the idea of the quarter quell not based on humanity, but on literary character. Really? A second book on the same far fetched concept? Only a young adult book could get away with this. Still, the author regrouped and completed a reasonable story, although I will say that my initial concern about the maturity of the main character is still too far fetched to be real. All in all this book is decent, but is nothing compared to the first.
B007O3QC8K|3.0|This performance commands attention. It is superior to the Fourth which appeared a few years ago.  The Berlin Philharmonic play magnificently (and not least, the double-basses and cellos). The recording is good. Sir Simon is more adept than previously in this domain: the long lines are less of a trial. His patience is admirable.  One does not become a master Brucknerian overnight but he is showing progress (to wit, the fugue in the finale where Sir Simon builds up a tremendous head of steam - it's the best I have heard).  There is still cause for concern whenever the score is in `second gear' but this performance does not fail from 'the sag'. Above all, this is a noble enterprise. There is no excuse nowadays not to play the finale. Hopefully others will follow Sir Simon's lead.<br /><br />Even so, it is not the Word. Here is a quick critique of the first movement. I nitpick but Sir Simon and the Berliners warrant comparison with the best.<br /><br />At the opening, the exchange between the woodwind and brass is somewhat brusque. I don't detect any \\"emergence from the primordial fog\\" such as Barenboim encapsulates so well [[ASIN:B000000SDZ Bruckner: Symphony No. 9]].  Sir Simon is clearly not conversant with that memorable little tome \\"Anton Bruckner and the Art of the Infinitesimal Delay.\\"<br /><br />If there is any tension in the episode for woodwind at 11'41\\" to 12'34\\" , I cannot hear it. Likewise at 14'29\\"ff .<br /><br />The titanic outburst that occurs at 15'35\\" ends tamely. In the Barenboim alternative, Marcus Curtius - in the guise of the brass - rides his stallion into the abyss. Here, it is inaudible.<br /><br />It is  a weak handover at 21'10\\"<br /><br />The coda - sadly - is unsubtle. Rattle focuses so much on the first violins to the detriment of the wider aural picture.  He also shifts hastily from second gear to fourth if not fifth gear (22'43\\") and then consequently has nothing more to give at 23'11. Contrast this with the Barenboim who waits until the very last second beyond shifting into Fifth and memorably so (24'44\\").<br /><br />As above, these are relatively minor points. There is however, a cardinal weakness that prevents this performance of the Bruckner Ninth from disturbing the likes of Furtwangler (44), Herbie (1966 & 1976) and Barenboim (Berlin, not Chicago) with the latter being my preferred version.<br /><br />It is easy - in a way - to play the Bruckner Ninth as \\"Tod und Verkl&auml;rung with ostintatos\\". It ain't. There is a sizeable dose of psychosis and dread to it.  As so often, one defaults to Robert Simpson for clarity. \\"In the first movement of the Eighth the sense of tragedy is objectively expressed, the tonal conflicts of the Fifth Symphony suggest a great classical fresco, in the strange tonal tensions in the finale of the Sixth we do not feel as if the composer is himself terrified by his own fantasies. But in the Ninth we sometimes receive this impression, not so much in the ferocious scherzo as in parts of the first movement and large tracts of the tormented Adagio.\\"<br /><br />What a concept: of a composer being terrified by his own creation.<br /><br />I find no trace of this here. High drama - yes. Poetry - yes.  Anger - yes, but not mortal terror. Mystery is likewise in short supply.<br /><br />And quite frankly, the Finale is a disappointment and the blame does not lie with the performers in any way - they give their all. Wildner's edition is clearly superior.<br /><br />Every coda in the Bruckner canon is a standalone feature. I do not know of a single instance where it is welded to the previous orchestral tutti - but that's what we get here. My fellow reviewer Ralph was right to lament the absence of the bridging material in the build up to the coda. Momentum in Bruckner is not a linear concept - much like Mallory's assault on Everest, Bruckner stops, breathes and then resumes the ascent. Here, it is both muddled and madcapped with no such segmentation. Moreover, why quote the twothirds of the main theme from the first movement and not the remainder?<br /><br />In short, the scholars (Samale/Mazzuca/Phillips/Cohrs) have buggered up the end of the finale by over-ratiocination. Given that the movement is only five-sixths complete - and Bruckner surely would have revised a complete version before sending it off to the publisher - why not run with the creative inspiration that produced the earlier version?

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|SPOILERS****<br /><br />This book is an example of an author that dug a huge hole, and could not for the life of them find a way out. The great thing about fantasy though is that you can create anything you like to make that happen. Considering this is a young adult book, the ratcheting up of violence in this series is rather disturbing. The third book takes this to a new level of explanation. The author does a good job of subduing details, but it is still over the top. The story advances continuously by killing off characters, but never comes to a final conclusion about the main ones, which is disappointing. For example, two lines are devoted to what finally happens to Gale, and maybe four to Peeta. In the end I found the literary approach or lack thereof in explaining the key details regarding the new antagonist \\"Coin\\" to be extremely lacking and the final resolution also extremely disappointing. It is as if the build up of three books comes to a climax and the author decided to rush through it so they could catch an episode of Seinfeld on TV. The ending is not mature writing and leaves a lot to be desired. I like the concept of this series and its potential, but I am afraid you would do better to use your imagination than rely on this author's resolve. Sorry.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|Like many of the other reviewers, I was somewhat disappointed on my first listen to \\"Shape Shifter\\". It paled in comparison to Santana albums from the 70s which I still listen to with frequency.<br /><br />However, with multiple listens, some in which I stopped doing other things and simply LISTENED, the album has grown on me. It still has that Santana \\"cry\\" and passion. I look forward to more listening to come.<br /><br />There is good music making on this album. The key to appreciating it is: 1) don't compare it to the past (at least while you are listening), and 2) actually listen to the entire album several times with an open mind and without distractions.<br /><br />What I love in this album is actually what I don't like about it (simply because there is less of it there).<br /><br />In the 70s, Santana's bands consisted of headstrong, individualistic players. You could hear it in their playing. Therefore, the songs \\"breathed\\". There was push and pull. Players listened to each other and responded in energy as well as in the trading of \\"licks\\".<br /><br />There is still some of this on the new album, but, unfortunately, less. First, I think it may be modern recording techniques, with use of click tracks, not recording live in the studio, doing the solos after the rhythm tracks etc. Secondly, maybe Santana is so big now that the musicians he hires do not dare play anything without direction from him. I do not know if the second is true, but it sounds as if that could be the case.<br /><br />The best tracks on this album are the ones in which you can tell there is not a click track. The tempos accelerate and slow down. The worst tracks, in my opinion, are those in which the pace sounds like a clock and the drum parts, for example, sound almost like canned backing tracks.<br /><br />The guitar sound on this album is rich, full and big. Problem is, it sounds more or less the same throughout the album. On the old albums, there was more diversity in the guitar tone. Again, I have no idea how the new album was recorded, but it sounds as if the guitar was plugged directly into a recording console and digitally processed. In the old days, you would have a player playing different guitars through different \\"live\\" amplifiers being recorded by different microphones in different placements, all the time picking up different acoustics. Also, since much of the playing was taking place live, not overdubbed, you would also get the blended acoustics of the band playing in the same acoustic space. The new album sounds too \\"perfect\\" acoustically, and thus not as diverse.<br /><br />OK. So fellow, old Santana fans... Get your comparisons out of the way. They are valid comparisons, but don't let them deafen you. Go and actually listen to this album. Listen to it all the way through more than once. Stop your internet surfing for a few songs at least and just listen without distraction. There is still tons of beauty in this album. Therefore, I give it four stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|i really loved the hunger games and this book to.  i liked the first book better but catching fire was really good.  it is to bad that there are only three books in the series but you take the three books there are in as you go.
B000HWZ5WE|5.0|Love this cd and play it all of the time.  Just wish there was more music on it.  These guys are great and they need to do more.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I have been able to put in quite a bit of time playing, and have enjoyed every bit. It has different several different challenges, creating a fun app that is worth getting!
B006Z21ZEM|4.0|Iron Maiden does a fantastic job in concert, and this live disc is no exception! The guys really bring the songs to life in concert. There is no such thing as a boring Iron Maiden concert, and I am thrilled to be seeing them again June 29 in Camden, NJ. UP THE BLOODY IRONS!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read all three books very quickly, mainly because by the middle of book two I was skimming the sex scenes unless they were ones that took place in his S&M chamber that I thought might actually advance the plot somehow. Now I never thought I'd say this but there was actually too MUCH sex in these books! I was really interested in the actual plot line but in the end I was annoyed because the writing was so poor. I think the sex scenes occurring so often actually took away from the story for me.  I also found that certain elements and phrases were repeated FAR too often (ie. the word mercurial and the whole inner goddess thing) and half the time I felt like the author was just saying the same thing five different ways.<br />I'm not saying don't read them, because the actual PLOT to these stories is quite interesting. But be advised that if you like the plot to advance at a normal pace, then you're going to have to skim quite a bit, as certain things might start to grate on your nerves!<br />I understand the hype though, I think this is the first novel I've ever read involving S&M and I found that part fascinating! I even ended up googling terms because I had no idea what they were talking about ;)<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey Movie....I will definitely be going to see that!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found this book completely enthralling and was unable to put it down. I completed reading it in record time and then consumed the two additional in the trilogy as well.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Yes, its almost criminal that this great film did not get a big theatrical release. Not much more I can say that hasn't already been said here. Check this one out!!!!
0345803507|5.0|Love love loved this book it's so amazingly intense and so leaves you with wanting more so you have to buy all 3 books so you won't miss a beat !!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very cute game... cant wait to see where the game-play goes! (: very easy to understand and user friendly. would recommend to friends
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Everything Jane writes is worth reading, but until you can find the time to read, this \\"Northanger Abby\\" version is completely worth the time it takes to watch.  It must certainly leave out hunks and small chunks of plot and character development Jane fans love, but it substitutes with wonderful period costumes and sweet, gentle cinematography of the English countryside.  I've both read and watched and am glad for both.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever you get to play with your favorite ice age characters and u cant get enough ussually I get bored within a day. or two but this time its for real
B000PTOICC|3.0|Be careful when you order, as the picture is misleading. You are only ordering one battery, consistent with the description, but different than what the photo implies. Given the slow shipping, $2.50 seems a bit steep when others are selling 5-packs for $4.
B007RXRSEY|4.0|I've been listening to the streaming version on the rolling stone website, and I love the album.  There's some truth to the theory that Slash is only as good as the band he surrounds himself with, and he's in good hands with Myles Kennedy and The Conspirators. Plain and simple....it's great old school rock!
B00138KKP8|5.0|Ray is now one of my favorites. Great voice I don't understand why it took a appeal for abused dogs to bring his music Trouble to the main stream
B007H7XJD4|1.0|Normally I try to find something nice to say but I just cant' find anything in this movie worth recommending. Poor story-line and poor acting. Some very nice CG but I think we are all past the \\"gee whiz\\" stage on that front.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my girls love this game and so far we have had no complaints with the game functions. everyone in my house plays it from my teenagers to my 7 yr old.
0385344228|3.0|This Kafkaesque story of a family in crisis is good, but not the masterful tour de force it's been held out as.  If you can compare reading a book to visiting a new restaurant, I didn't feel like I'd been been cheated, exactly, but I wasn't really satisfied either.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really did not enjoy this book.  I was interested in reading it because of all the hype in the media.  Did not like it at all.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|this is one of the best books on ndes that i've ever read.  would definitely recommend to all!  her amazing comeback from having cancer is nothing short of miraculous.
1573225517|3.0|Probably worth three-and-a-half stars.<br />This novel has some very funny moments but I did tire of it a bit.<br />I'm not sure I liked the point of view character a lot - and that's a problem when the book is written in the first person and you've really only got one character to choose from.<br />There's comedy to be had using a combination of what the first-person characters says and what they really think . But that becomes fairly predictable over the course of a novel.<br />Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood to enjoy this novel. Perhaps I hungered for meat and three veg and what I got was blamange. Sweet enough, but it didn't fill me up
B006PAO2FS|4.0|In 1980 I went to see Hunter S. Thompson.  Somebody asked him about Bob Dylan's move to Christian-themed music, which had just happened at that time.  Hunter responded, \\"I think that Bob Dylan has earned the right to do any damn thing he wants to do.\\"  Ditto McCartney.  Not every album is going to be Abbey Road.  But I'm sure glad that I don't have the constricting attitudes of the folks giving this album one star; there's a LOT to like about this record.
B006C45CFG|4.0|This is a fun movie with great actors.  I enjoyed it for what it was but don't think I would purchase it.
B007CKNX28|2.0|I know that rock is not supposed to be too challenging, but come on, next time please try harder to surprise me.
0307959856|4.0|I very much enjoyed this novel.  I am a huge Jane Austen fan, but do not expect any modern author to replicate Austen's writing style.  With this relaxed expectation, I thought this book was an interesting interpretation of Austen's characters.<br /><br />I found the mystery to be captivating, if the resolution did feel a little forced.  I do not generally read mystery novels, though, so I again expect that I have low expectations on that front, judging by some of the other reviews.<br /><br />Also, some reviewers said there was too much legal procedure involved.  I am a lawyer, so this didn't bother me.<br /><br />I guess the central thesis of this review is that I thought this book was great, but I had low expectations and a high tolerance for legal jargon.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|It's always been kind of frustrating being a Garbage fan seeing as they have only released 5 albums to date during their 17 year existence up to this point. Their latest \\"Not Your Kind of People\\" comes 7 long years after their last release \\"Bleed Like Me\\". I felt that Bleed Like Me was the best thing they had done since their debut in addition to advancing their sound while the latest release that I will refer to as NYKOP from here on out feels like more of a regression and celebration of the sound that they had back during their 90's heyday.<br /><br />It seems like NYKOP was done more for the hardcore fans rather than trying to win over new converts at this late stage in their career. It should please their fan base but other people who have been kind of indifferent towards what Garbage has offered in their career thus far will probably just shrug their shoulders and state that it sounds just like all of the other stuff. Well yeah, it does sound like a great combination of their self titled 1995 debut and the 1998 follow up \\"Version 2.0\\" and really sounds like it sould have followed those 2 releases easily. It definitely doesn't have quite as a much of a stripped down band sound like 2001's \\"Beautiful Garbage\\" and especially 2005's \\"Bleed Like Me\\" did but it makes me realize exactly what it was that made me fall in love with Garbage from the get go. Shirley Manson continues to grow as one of the most criminially underrated singers (female or otherwise) around and the band itself dances a fine line between a live performance and loops aplenty.<br /><br />While NYKOP is undeniably quite a bit of a regression in their sound after Bleed Like Me, I don't really view that as a negative in this particular case. After a 7 year gap, it seems to me that they are both embracing their classic sound and also using this as a platform to reintroduce to people what Garbage was about back in the mid to late 90's. This latest release does absolutely nothing new, but for longtime Garbage fans, any new music from this underrated band is always welcome in today's boring musical climate!<br /><br />I also highly suggest sprining the couple of extra dollars for the deluxe edition as you get 4 additional songs on it that are a lot of fun even if they come across more as B-side material in general.rbage fans, any new music from this underrated band is always welcome in today's boring musical climate!<br /><br />I also highly suggest sprining the couple of extra dollars for the deluxe edition as you get 4 additional songs on it that are a lot of fun even if they come across more as B-side material in general.
B007SGM084|2.0|A bit surprised this has been such a hit.  It is basically a mills & boon formula with a bit of bdsm soft porn thrown in.  Unless the author has picked up some of the criticisms regarding the heroine's inner dialogue, later books will be very annoying.  The same phrases are repeated over and over.  It feels like one person has written the basic story and another person has seasoned it with 'big' words and and few classical cultural references to add a bit of substance.  Anne Rice's 'Exit to Eden' is more erotic, better written and much edgier.  Buy 50 shades for your girlfriend if you want to add some spanky to your hanky panky without scaring her to death.  Buy 'Gone with the wind' by Margaret Mitchel, girls, if you are looking for real frustrated passion and romance. Go for the free sample before you commit.  I won't be reading beyond the first book.
0307956350|2.0|...but this book had so many flashbacks I felt like I should be taking notes to keep things straight.  There are Sci-fi books about time travel that don't jump around this much!!!  If done right, flashbacks can add depth to characters and reveal important plot insight but Pavone's overuse of them was clumsy, contrived and confusing.<br /><br />I usually enjoy books with a kick-ass female lead.  This book started off with promise.  Our heroine is an ex-CIA agent, who has managed to hide her profession from her husband for their entire marriage.  Now retired, her boredom is interrupted by the revelation that she's not the only liar in the marriage.  Sounds like a great premise but the characters are flat and erratic; helpless, shallow and naive and in a heartbeat transformed to calculating, devious and ruthless.  Maybe it will work better in a film version but I found it tough to swallow, tough to follow and can't recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Quite an engaging book.  I read the three books on my Kindle in one day.  The book was written in such a way that it was not considered pornography.  But E.L.James used sophisticated wording to describe intimate situations.  I feel that not a word demeanered women.  To me it was an exploration of intimate situations and exercises that many women need to be informed of and exlore...... to a limit for self comfort...HOT....HOT...HOT

0670022411|2.0|I debated between a review of 1 or 2 stars. Gave it 2 because there is potential for a good story. It started out good, was ok in the middle, but just bad by the end. There was some action/interesting parts at the beginning and the middle, but nothing interesting at the end. I kept waiting for something to happen. How much can one read about eating, drinking, talking, and sleeping. I realize this is a trilogy so the story isn't done, but there should be something climatic towards the end of each book. I felt let down that I read nearly 600 pages for not much to happen except set you up for the next book. There was way too much fluff in the book and it progressed slowly.<br /><br />Note to publishing houses: Not everything has to be a trilogy. Don't stretch out a decent story so much that you lose your readers interest after the first book!
0385738773|5.0|There is something so bittersweet about the final book in a series you loved so much. When the final Harry Potter book came out, I was thrilled and heart-broken at the same time! With The Death Cure, James Dashner's final book in the Maze Runner trilogy, I am sad to see the series end, but I started it hopeful the ending would be as I had hoped- finally a little peace for the kids who had been at the mercy of the evil corporation WICKED.<br /><br />Thomas and his friends survived the Maze (an experiment to judge their responses and hopefully find a cure to the Flare) and the Scorch (the terrifying desert filled with sick crazies). But now that they are back in the hands of WICKED, the company using them as lab rats to find the cure to the Flare, they know nothing good is going to happen to them. Held hostage and isolated for weeks, they finally find a way to escape, but to do so they have to trust Brenda and Jorge- WICKED employees planted in the Scorch to keep an eye on them. But with no other options, they find Brenda and Jorge hate WICKED as much as they do. Unfortunately, the world is a cold, dangerous place for Munies- those immune to the Flare.<br /><br />Once they manage to escape, they make there way to Denver which has become a walled, protected city free from the sickness. Unfortunately, the safety in Denver is all an illusion. The sickness is slowly starting to take over. When Thomas is contacted by the Right Arm, an organization devoted to take down WICKED, he knows they have to risk their lives and go back to the lab to destroy the evil people who test kids and have no qualms about watching them die. But can Thomas and his friends, the kids who lived through so much, make it through this final trial? Can they get rid of WICKED once and for all? And even if they do, what will be waiting for them on the other side?<br /><br />Oh Dashner, you rapscallion! You had me hanging through the whole book PRAYING you didn't leave those poor kids in a worse situation (and me totally ticked off) by the end of the story. Thank goodness you took it easy on those kids (and me!). We needed a good ending! This book was a great culmination in the trilogy we spent so much time waiting for (im)patiently and while I am sad to have it end, I am glad it ended the way it did.<br /><br />This series is phenomenal for any student, but I think it will be particularly successful with male struggling readers. The excitement and commitment to the young characters makes the story more than just plot twists and action. The kids I know who have started this series haven't been able to put it down. In fact, the adults I know who read these books couldn't put them down either!

As I described to my husband, it wasnt about the \\"sex\\" it was about the Good Cop bad cop throughout that kept me wanting more.  Their relationship is so complex yet so complete....I recently learned that the movie rights were sold and my first thoughts were that both Anastasia and Christian need to be played by a Non main stream actor or actress...this series deserves it own characters....thank you to all my friends for suggesting it..cant wait until the movies come out!!
0439023521|5.0|This product appears to be made to resemble a book. It consists of a thick cardstock like outer casing with vibrant colors and some sort of title. Once the casing is peeled back in a left to right fashion the interior is exposed. The interior of the piece consists of a much thinner paper. There is words printed on both sides of the interior pieces of paper.<br /><br />Overall a good product. It would work very well as some sort of kindling or maybe as a sort of camp latrine paper.

0307730697|4.0|Adam Brown's life ended in an isolated military clinic in the mountains of Afghanistan, his body riddled with AK-47 bullet holes from Taliban militia. However, Adam Brown's legacy lives on, described in his biography by author Eric Blehm. The book, Fearless, released today (May 22) is a moving account of the struggles, redemption, and sacrifice of Adam Brown.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a Navy SEAL operator serving in Afghanistan with the elite DEVGRU team, otherwise known as SEAL Team Six - the group that took out Osama bin Laden. Brown's journey to the top tier of military excellence is the story of a small-town American boy with a penchant for recklessness, an addiction to hard drugs, and a complete lack of fear.<br /><br />Brown's life was changed when he met Jesus in a grimy Arkansas jail cell. His problems didn't disappear. But his sinful heart was changed, and his life would take a totally different direction.<br /><br />Fearless chronicles the life of Adam Brown -- from humble birth to tragic death. The book tells the story of his wife's courage and persistant love. The book communicates the heroism of SEAL Team Six. The book conveys the pathos of war. Most importantly, Fearless shows how the love of Jesus can change a sinner's heart.<br /><br />Thoughts on Fearless<br />- Eric Blehm writes a good biography. He may lack the polish of an Erik Larson (Garden of the Beasts), but his style is simple and compelling. The power of his writing is its research and accuracy. Blehm set out to write a straightforward biography, not a sensational bestseller.<br />- Adam Brown's life is an inspiration. Ever since I was a kid, I cherished dreams of joining the Marines or Navy SEALs, just to prove to myself that I was powerful and capable. I'm probably not going to be heading into BUDS training, but I appreciated reading about someone who did. Adam Brown was the best of the best (SEAL) of the best (DEVGRU), working against unbelievable opposition and overcoming incredible obstacles to get there.<br />Brown wasn't just a meathead and military machine. He was a compassionate humanitarian, a devoted husband and father, and a disciple of Jesus. I appreciated his acts of kindness toward the Afghan children, and his brave witnessing to hardened SEALs.<br />- I'm thankful for our military. While I am not a fan of the ra-ra-beat-em-up-kill-em-all-send-em-to-hell approach to our nation's defense, I do appreciate those who serve in the armed forces. I am especially thankful for those, like Adam Brown, who bring compassion and maturity to their task.<br />- Most importantly, I marvel at the grace of God. Eric Brown's life, just as it is with anyone who has been redeemed, is a testament to God's infinite love and kindness. I was encouraged to be a channel of this kindness to others, and a faithful witness of his gospel. There are Eric Browns all around us. They need Jesus, not our judgment. They need grace.<br /><br />I encourage you to read Fearless for its dazzling display of God's grace, and its compelling story of sacrifice and courage.tacles to get there.<br />Brown wasn't just a meathead and military machine.

0385738765|5.0|I could not put this book down. Finally! All of my questions are answered and it is a novel of continuous action. I found myself skipping paragraphs just to find out what happens next (I would then go back and read the skipped ones.) If you are on the fence this is a must read I just wish the first book in the trilogy was this good.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I miss Andy as Spartacus, but Liam does a great job and brings his own to the part.  The actress for Naevia is different but needs time to bring her own to the role.  The other acters/actresses were great as always.  They do not disappoint.  The writers did a fine job.  They make it an even greater production as seasons progress.  I can't wait to season 3.  I can't wait to the Bluray release which provides extended episodes.

1400063736|2.0|I think people who don't like this book just don't like a certain style of writing. I felt hit over the head by redundant descriptions that felt just there for the sake of describing, and bordered on editorializing and were sometimes clich&eacute;d. That can annoy some readers. However there is optimism in it, and a unique kind of momentum.<br /><br />I do believe that McCann must be a lover of poetry. In fact I'd love to see whether he has published any long-form prose poems. I think he's ripe for that format.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Love this movie!  If you love classic stuff ...this movie  breathes life to the past.<br /><br />It is like a painting that became alive.  I will not analyze it to threads...it is to  be experienced.<br /><br />Let the director Cary F. and the superb actors Mia W. and of course, Michael F. And Jamie B. et. al. embody the lives of such characters  that interacted  over 100 years ago.<br /><br />Director  Cary F. did such a great job!  Your version is fresh, clean, beautiful , modern but classic!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Probably one of the most amazing books i have ever read. It has a wonderful story aside form the obvious sex. I will probably end up rereading this series again one day. I read the whole series in a little under a week, i couldn't put them down, it killed me to have to sleep and work haha.

B0053O89WY|5.0|Is there even a tentative release date for the Season 5 DVDs of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\".  My wife and I got addicted last fall.  We have the first four seasons and even t-shirts.  Can't wait for 5th season release.
B00773YOB4|5.0|I have been a fan of Bonnie Raitt's since the 70's.  Her husky voice is the original female bluesy instrument, emulated by so many on American Idol, and what a fabulous blues and rock guitarist.  She has always been a true professional, a perfectionist in fact, as well as an activist.  I have seen her live on many occasions at various benefit & \\"save the environment\\" & Honor the Earth concerts.  I already own most of her output, so was hesitant to buy another, but then amazon mp3 had it for 3.99.  Wow!  She has done it again.  This is one of her best albums ever, definitely worth adding to your collection. The production is impecable and crisp, the tunes (many are covers) are catchy, bluesy, rock 'n roll --  altogether  a winner. If you're not familiar with Bonnie Raitt, then do yourself a favor and do so!

0385474547|4.0|Despite (or because of) embarrassment about his father's laziness, Okonkwo works hard to be a respected farmer and warrior in his Nigerian village of Umuofia. When Christian Missionaries bring their strange religion and customs and laws, Okonkwo and his fellow villagers are first amused, then frustrated. In this heart-rending masterpiece, Achebe brings to life a powerful, though flawed, protagonist who fights for what he believes is right.

0393061310|4.0|In this Pulitzer Prize winning book, Diamond attempts to answer the question of why the Western Civilization rose to power instead of other civilizations. His answer is that they lucked out on geography and ecology. Western civilizations were better able to domesticate animals and plants due to the varieties that they had available, and were therefore able to develop larger farming societies, allowing for development of crafts and \\"scientific exploration.\\" Also, because they were in larger groups, they were exposed at low levels to many germs, and developed immunity. Because of these factors, they were able to harness the power of guns, germs, and steel in their pursuit of world power. This was a fascinating book, and definitely worth reading even after watching the documentary. It's just packed full of information, the writing is smooth and articulate, and the research is extensive.
B00753MBHA|1.0|There is no Accept without Udo. Udo is ACCEPT. Whats going on now  the band is milking a long time ago dead cow and new members just ripping off benefits created by Udo. This album sucks, just like a previous one.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|It has been some time since I read the book, Sarah's key, which I reviewed here on Amazon. So long ago, in fact, I'd have a hard time saying for sure if the movie is \\"true\\" to the book. I need to re-read. But it wasn't a book I was planning on revisiting anytime soon, since it was so very heart-breakingly sad. Well, the movie is very much in the same vein--very sad, very emotional.<br /><br />Kristen Scott Thomas is VERY good. She is definitely the stand out in this film, and really, besides Sarah, the main character, the plot revolves around her and her discoveries. At a difficult crossroads in her life and her marriage, she and her husband are about to remodel and move into the apartment her husbands parents purchased during the war in Paris. A journalist, Julia learns there was a large round up of Jews in the occupied city during the war that no one even seems to know about. And then she learns even more disturbing news about their \\"new\\" apartment.<br /><br />This film was very beautiful, the scenery was breathtaking. The young woman who plays an young adult Sarah Starzynski, Charlotte Poutrel is gorgeous, quietly mysterious and sad. The young actress who plays Sarah as a child is phenomenal: the role is nuanced and M&eacute;lusine Mayance is extraordinary in dragging you along on her journey and quest, reluctantly, as you know it will come to no good end.<br /><br />I almost didn't watch it, as there are some films and books, that while fictional, touch such a sorrowful place in me. But this film was very well done. I also really loved the actors who played the Dufaure couple, the farmers that help and hide Sarah after she escapes from the camp, Niels Arestrup and Dominique Frot--they were most endearing. Seeing Aidan Quinn as an aolder much heavier man was a  shock, but his appearnace suited his role as Sarah's son in the film. This is a great movie for a rainy day. Not for children under 12, as it could be very disturbing for them.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Mayer proves himself to be master of pretty much any style to which he sets his hand.  Here, he takes on easy 60's influenced country folk/rock, and he does it as if he were born to that style.  His guitar picking is first rate, simple and direct, always masterful.  His voice is in fantastic form, warmer, huskier than ever, sounding wiser for the life that he has lived.  He is so gifted at the guitar that sometimes we forget what a gifted singer/interpreter he is, and this gift for melody is in the forefront on this album.  Standouts for me include \\"Shadow Days\\", with an almost Harrison-esque opening guitar line segueing gently into a piano backed, steel guitar fueled easy groove.  He sings with conviction and beauty, a plea for understanding of a difficult breakup.  \\"I'm a good man, with a good hart, had a tough time, had a rough start...but I finally learned to let it go...now I'm right here, and right now, and I'm open, knowing somehow that my shadow days are over now\\".  I hope that his shadow days are over; this guy feels real, this feels like a really heartfelt tune, and is an instant favorite for me.  I also love the title track, with it's singalong feel and dense but lovely harmonies--and a divine harmonica.  The album ends with a reprise of the song, and it gives the whole album a completed feel.  \\"Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey\\" offers more plaintive harmonica over a great piano figure/guitar harmony, and some inventive chord changes that somehow feel right throughout.  John Mayer has always been good at crafting full albums worth of music--not a lot of filler on most of his albums; this album is just the same, but even more so--there is a sense that this was crafted as a set, each song as a piece unto a whole vision.  I haven't heard a Mayer album that I don't end up enjoying, but in the end, I think that this one has become a real special part of his musical tapestry, and an album that I will return to often and with genuine pleasure.  A long time ago, he saidthat he wanted to be the kind of guy that his fans will follow over the years as he grows.  I smiled at the time, thinking that he wouldn't really last that long.  I was wrong, and I'm so glad that I was, because this young man has something to say, the skills to say it well, and the heart to make me care.  Unreservedly recommended.
B0081ELJ7U|5.0|This show gave me butterflies.  I love Castle and his vulnerability.  Esposito is the hottest!  Ryan showed real friendship - sometimes you have to do the hard thing for those you care about.  Beckett get's the best lead ever in the end!  When is the next show - I can't wait!
B006CS7UXO|5.0|I love this stuff. Dance music that is so well done, so well sung, so well performed, that it leaves you in awe. I first heard Pet Shop Boys when they burst on the dance and pop scene back in the early 80s. Their Bobby O produced single \\"West End Girls\\" was an ear-opening experience. I was an instant fan. At the time I was also a big fan of \\"alternative\\" rock, but Pet Shop Boys were the ones to satisfy my inner disco soul. Their music was, and remains, a gulity pleasure for me. But of course they weren't just dance dudes, their music had --- and still has --- a very strong melodic pop sensibility to it. But I'm preaching to the choir here, I think. You all know how good their music is. And this 2-CD compilation is no exception. Admittedly, I have NOT been listening to each and every album PSB have released since I moved overseas in 1996. As another reviewer noted, the music they have done since then is practically that of a separate era. And yet ... their basic sound has not changed much during those long years. Their songs still sound vibrant and exuberant. The formula may remain the same, but don't go thinking PSB have become stagnant or that the songs on this compilation are inferior to their earlier tunes. With 38 songs on here, I assure you that there are some real gems to be found ... and heard. My personal faves are found on disc two; songs such as \\"The Resurrectionist\\" , \\"Friendly Fire\\", and \\"Always\\". But that's this week. I just got this collection last week and I'm certain that other tracks will endear themselves to me soon enough. Such is the beauty of Pet Shop Boys songs. Despite what some critics may say, there is depth and variety to their music. Music to dance to, songs to sing, melodies that linger. What more do you need?

B005LAIHIQ|2.0|Maybe someday Tim Burton will wander back from cuckooland and once more make movies that grip you beyond the pretty,pretty visuals. DARK SHADOWS starts out so promisingly, getting me so enthused, and then, as it went on, the awfulness seeped in and built and built. Here I am, tearing out of the movie theater, in a foul, condemning mood. My date's asking that I not walk so fast, but I can't get out of there fast enough.<br /><br />I've no concrete point of reference to compare this film adaptation to, although the original television cult classic had been around for decades, lurking as this creaky pop culture trivia. But I thought the film instantly assumes a vibrant gothic presence and unveils a captivating introductory segment. In short strokes, this opening passage chronicles the establishing of a Maine fishing village in the 18th century and the life and death - and then undeath - of Barnabas Collins, scion of the founding Collins family. Barnabas Collins, who fails to love a comely witch and is cursed with vampirism. The villagers turn on him. They bury him in the dirt.<br /><br />- Barnabas Collins: \\"Tell me, future dweller, what is the year?\\"<br />- Willie Loomis: \\"1972.\\"<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley (always reliable) plays Willie Loomis, butler to the present-day Collins clan and the first person Barnabas doesn't bite upon his release from entombment. Two hundred years (or, to be exact, 196 years) after being put in the ground, Barnabas bursts out of his coffin, shatters the chains encircling it, finds himself in today's modern era, in 1972. He makes a beeline for his ancestral home, now reduced to a dusty and dilapidated estate.<br /><br />Barnabas encounters his distant descendants and worms his way into their ambivalent graces, passing himself off as a relative from overseas. Only Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), the stern matriarch, knows the truth of Barnabas. In the passing centuries, the family fortunes have plummeted. Barnabas vows to return the Collins family to its former stature of wealth and prominence. He doesn't know yet that he's set himself against a familiar supernatural presence. It's sort of apropos that in 1972 the Eagles released their single \\"Witchy Woman.\\"<br /><br />You eyeball this glittering lineup and assume that you're in for some powerhouse performances. Except that this unfolds mostly as a one man show. Johnny Depp is undeniably fabulous, and if that's all you're looking for in this flick, then you'll walk away sated. You have to allow for Depp's affectations, his character's arch mannerisms, those expressive, elongated fingers of his. You have to, I guess, allow for his character's lack of accountability. Barnabas pretty much gets away with murdering a bunch of people, but never mind, never mind. I frankly love what Depp does with this role. But then most everyone else follows suit, and that negates the effectiveness of what Depp was trying to do. Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, even Chloë Grace Moretz all submit such stylized performances that I had a problem relating to them. Only Eva Green, as the wicked and long-lived Angelique Bouchard, brings it with vivid energy and great enthusiasm. Down the centuries, the witch Angelique had become a powerufl and influential figure in this fishing community. Compelled by dark designs, she promptly renews acquaintances with the lover who once spurned her.<br /><br />I admit to relishing the fish-out-of-water gags surrounding Barnabas' 18th century sensibilities colliding with the modern-day culture of 1972. He gazes, entranced, at a lava lamp, thinking it composed of blood and urine. He hangs out with hippies. He thinks the \\"M\\" on a MacDonald's stands for \\"Mephistopholes.\\" But the best bit may be Alice Cooper's cameo at the ball, with Barnabas gazing at him thru opera glasses and muttering: \\"Ugliest woman I have ever seen.\\" It's a shame the film denies us the thrill of a unique interaction between Barnabas and Alice. It's just one more missed opportunity.<br /><br />I don't think Tim Burton can craft an ugly-looking film if his life depended on it. DARK SHADOWS is cinematically well-executed. It treats us to a series of sumptuous visuals. But it's hollow gratification, yo. The story suffers from poor character development, the lack of a narrative drive, the actors' languid approach, and an underdeveloped and absolutely unearned love story. About the last, Barnabas keeps refering to the slim governess he adores as possessing these \\"fertile birthing hips,\\" except that she totally doesn't, so what was he going on about? The campiness and sense of satire are so marked that they pretty much overwhelm whatever meager grounding the film has. I admire Depp's performance, but I don't care about his character. I don't care about any of these characters. I don't perceive them as anything but caricatures. Anyway, the narrative, ultimately, takes a back seat to Depp's doing his weird sh--. To cap off the awfulness of it all, things fall apart at the climax. Somewhere along this final sequence, the film even finds the nerve to drop a reveal about Chloë Grace Moretz's character that is jarring and comes out of left field. In the past few years Burton and Depp's collaboration has become a gimmicky thing. It's disconcerting that SLEEPY HOLLOW - the last film by these two that I've really enjoyed - is thirteen years old. I had such high hopes for this one. I love several things about this DARK SHADOWS. But I dislike so much more about it.unity.<br /><br />I don't think Tim Burton can craft an ugly-looking film if his life depended on it. DARK SHADOWS is cinematically well-executed.

B007H9B8FS|2.0|The new Garbage album makes me really wonder what CURVE could accomplish if they really tried; which probably shouldn't be an old time Garbage fan's first thought. This release is way too over-produced and Shirley's voice is so off in the background and way too processed. Effects are cool.... but you need some precision and restraint. There are some really good songs here, but they're just... way too over done. It's like being served burnt toast with some apple butter.

0439023521|4.0|Not much for intellectual stimulation, though the author does manage to slip in some good prose. The story is a fun one to read. Collins introduces us to a world you want to visit agan. And the characters, though childish in their thoughts and conversations, are still interesting to read about.
0439023521|5.0|A well-paced and captivating, though dark, journey through a possible future. It's great to feel a sense of excitement about a book like this. I thoroughly enjoyed The Hunger Games!

B007N0REX6|4.0|Slash returns for his new solo album with Myles Kennedy from Alter Bridge on vocals and it is a great rock album that is sure to please fans waiting for a worthy sequel to Appetite For Destruction. The production on this album is cool with the guitars right up front and Myles Kennedy's vocals wailing on top. Slash is in fine form with some great riffs and some equally killer solos. Slash lets his influences such as Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith permeate his song and riff ideas but he puts his own modern spin on it all. Highlights include the rocking album opener \\"Apocalyptic Love\\", the awesome groove of \\"Standing In The Sun\\", the massive chorus hook of \\"No More Heroes\\", and the classical vibe of the guitar hook in \\"Anastasia\\". The deluxe edition has the two bonus tracks \\"Carolina\\" and \\"Crazy Life\\" that are definitely worth having and there is also an interesting behind the scenes look at the making of the album. Despite containing a couple of filler tracks, Apocalyptic Love is highly recommended to fans of Slash and will rank as one of the best pure rock albums of the year.

0375842209|5.0|The fictional story of the Book Thief set in World War II Germany, gives readers a different view on history as the story takes you back to WWII but through the eyes of a little German girl.  The tone and mood of this book is sad and depressing at times but also teaches the importance of family throughout the novel. Narrated by the omnipresent Death, the story swaps from small interjections by Death to the main character's point of view. This book would be ideal for anyone older than fifteen. I say this because the book has a lot of mature reading material that many under this age bar would not understand or be too immature to read. In general, I found this book extremely good. It was hard to put it down and the story and plot seemed to flow as if was not a made up story but a historical account that was written down word for word. The purpose of this novel was to relieve the bias feelings of World War  2 and give people around the world, mostly Americans, a view that we rarely think about. Today in our arrogant society a wake up like this is well needed. The author did an amazing job creating this book and for these reasons i give the book a top rating.<br /> ==============================================================SPOILER ALERT ====================================================<br />Not many things could improve this novel, but if any particular changes could have been made I would say that the author should not have killed off nearly every character in the final chapters. He spent the length of the book making the character's grow and giving the reader insight into their lives only to throw all of this away. He may have done it to make the loss that much more hard but i would have done otherwise.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh boy where do I start?  A colleague asked me if I would read the book (inappropriate in itself if you ask me) and kept asking until I downloaded the darned Fifty Shades.  From the start, I found Ana to be ditzy.  Although she is an allegedly educated 21-year-old, she came off as a silly 15-year-old more often than not.  The language she used to describe her inner thoughts was juvenile at best with her incessant usage of phrases such as, \\"holy cow\\" \\"jeez\\" \\"oh crap\\" and so on.  The repetition turned me off immensely.  The repetition continued when describing the couple's sex antics.  I mean really, how many times did Christian wrap her hair around his fist and yank her head back?  Better yet, how many times can one person \\"fist their hands\\" into someone's hair?  In fact, the continued use of the term \\"fist\\" was unnerving considering many of the things that Christian wanted to do to Ana.  For someone who is educated with a 4.0 average, she was quite gullible when it came to the `contract.'  I could not imagine not one person I knew signing such a degrading piece of crap such as that contract unless they were considerably intoxicated.  Even then, their \\"inner goddess\\" and their \\"subconscious\\" would scream and holler until they backed off.  Speaking of which, the author's continued use of the inner goddess and Ana's subconscious read like a Judy Blume book.  I kept looking for Margaret to complete the narratives, but even the 12-yar-old Margaret would have had better lines.  The fact that this allegedly bright young woman inexperienced in love lust, or whatever, even considered entertaining such a life altering proposition from a virtual stranger just because he was 'good-looking' was entirely unbelievable.  Never mind the fact that Christian repeatedly (there's that repetition again) admitted that he wanted to hurt her despite her inherent fear of him doing so was enough for me to want to call the cops on this almost rape fantasy of a book.  This is nothing that I would recommend to anyone nor would I have the gall to ask anyone that I knew if they had or would ever read this nonsense.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|What a fabulous show.  I've never bought a tv series, but this one is going to be well worth watching over and over to catch the clues and referrals of the dual world of fantasy and storybrooke.  I sure hope the DVD had a directors commentary and additional trivia to unfold.  ABC better continue this series because there are few shows you can enjoy with the whole family and this is one of them.
1741798981|2.0|I have visited London every year for the last 22 years.  So, I thought I would pit my knowledge against theirs.<br /><br />The first thing is I feel that this guide is written for people with no attention span.  Everything is very short and overly breif.<br /><br />First issue is how to get from the Heathrow to your hotel.  The Underground is great but will take you over an hour to central London.  Also, if your hotel is not off the Picadilly line, then you are going to have to transfer trains (and possibly more than once.)  So you are going to have to tote your baggage between trains.  This is also an issue with Heathrow Express, it only takes you to Victoria.<br /><br />So if you have two or three bags, you might want to explore the hotel bus shuttle.  More expensive but it might save your back!<br /><br />Second issue is the list of hotels and restaraunts, its a laundry list.  They list a number of restaraunts in each district of London but really don't break it down beyond the list (ie. price, cuisine.)  It would be nice also for them to review the chain restaraunts (Garfunkels, Angus Steak House and Bistro 1).  You see these while walking around and sometimes just want something safe.  (Bistro 1 is the best of the list but go for their two course meal, Garfunkels is a bad Denny's and Angus is good but over priced).
B004LWZW42|5.0|This was an enjoyable movie for fans of the genre; the pace, action and special effects were all well done and the story was filled with action. I had not read any reviews but watched it because of my general interest in the characters and the story of the beginnings of the X-Men.<br /><br />The movie was always on the move and held my attention from beginning to end. One discovers important information about each of the main characters and has a chance to observe the forces and circumstances that made them what they became later. As with all movies of this sort one must be able to accept the givens and I was able to do that so the movie became a vehicle for an afternoon's enjoyment. The video and audio quality is excellent although there were no special features on the disc which will present some viewers with a feeling something was left out.<br /><br />I recommend it for the fan of fantasy adventure movies.
B00122KW0I|5.0|This is some of the best music of all time! It's worth the money! Howard Shore does a wonderful job of bringing Tolkien's novel and Peter Jackson's films to life! Wonderful! (Notice how all my sentences end with exclamation points!)

B00007EDY5|5.0|This is required when using strobes and not wanting to use the external hot shoe flash for firing the strobes. It works extremely well. The only thing I don't like is that it has only 1 port for one strobe for cable syncing, you cannot use more than one cable at a time. Typically you can shoot and one strobe will fire giving out a signal for the other strobe to fire, this doesn't always work out wonderfully 'lighting wise' for some reason. I am a photography student so I am still learning. It is very affordable and great to have when using one strobe light, unless you're a pro at studio lighting.
B005HP2J66|5.0|This 1994 very informative and picturesque 3D documentary tells the story of the discovery of a cave in France containing paintings drawn about 32,000 years ago, making them the earliest still-existing paintings. Remarkably, the drawings of the animals, mostly horses, are so well done that one can almost see the muscles of the animals and sense their movements. There are also scenes of animals fighting. There is only one figure of a human, a woman that shows the lower half of her body. The cave also contains animal bones. There is a foot print of an eight year old boy and a wolf and we do not know if they walked together, the wolf was attacking the boy, or the two prints were made years apart. There is a column of stones with a bear's head at its flat top, and we do not know if this was an altar or an object of worship. A man who was six feet tall with a crooked little finger left a print of his hand, perhaps as a signature, on a cave wall.<br /><br />The cave entrance was apparently closed-in by a land slide thereby preserving its contents.<br /><br />The film has about a half dozen scientists explain the insides of the cave which is still being studied and to which entrance if restricted. They also explain how covered caves are found, including sensing air coming from between rocks.<br /><br />Besides obtaining a great deal of information about the past, some of which will be contrary to what they thought formally, such as the ancients being very short and very unintelligent and unable to draw properly, viewers will be prompted to think about other subjects concerning our ancestors, such as how did these obviously at least somewhat competent people live.

B0034G4P80|4.0|This 3D action film based on a Marvel comic out of space figure is fun to watch. The 3D gives the viewers a sense of depth, but there are very few times when viewers think they see items coming out toward them. The film is filled with magical/science fiction gadgets, such as a hammer that gives its user enormous power. Thor is the son of the king of a planet unknown to earthlings. His father needs to decide whether he is fit to succeed him as king. Thor commits an act that threatens his father's kingdom and is exiled to earth. While he is gone, his brother engages in acts that are far worse than the one that resulted in Thor's banishment. Thor faces problems on earth and needs to return to his planet to save it.

0307959856|5.0|P. D. James, considered by many to be the queen of murder mysteries, an author who is able to write a novel that is both high quality literature and a suspenseful and engrossing murder mystery, has succeeded with this volume in capturing all of the literary qualities of Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice and more. She continues the story of Elizabeth after her marriage to Darcy, as the two are living together with their children at their estate in Pemberley, and she uses the same language, turn of phrases, and sometimes antiquated terms, as Jane Austen. The characters from Pride and Prejudice reappear in this novel and we read how their and their family's life continued. However, James introduces a murder committed on the Pemberley grounds and we read how one of the people we know well from Pride and Prejudice is charged with and tried in court for the murder.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I was psyched when I found this product online!  I purchased this item for a THREE HOUR Spin-a-Thon I was taking part in 5/20/12.  I use a program called Digifit with an ANT+ device that connects to the bottom of my iPhone to keep track of my calories burnt/heart rate.  I wasn't sure my iPhone would last the entire three hours while using the Digifit program and wanted to make sure the battery wasn't drained.<br /><br />Conducting an online search I found this product.  I already had the charger and USB/mini USB to connect the CableJive to my external battery.  This basically was in the center of my iPhone and ANT+ device, connecting the two so I could charge my phone while still being connected to the Digifit program!  Genius!  Apple doesn't make anything like it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the item I recieved was defective but the part that inserts INTO my iPhone ripped part of the piece that it connects to in the phone.  The bottom section that my Digifit connected to basically came apart and stopped working.  Mind you, this happened the first day I recieved it and tried it out.  It didn't even make it to my Spin-a-Thon.<br /><br />I WILL NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN.  I would have given it -Stars if available.  Great idea however the product was a piece of junk.  I now have to be extra careful with my iPhone so the damahed pieces don't completely fall apart and I am not due to replace my phone for another two years.<br /><br />NOT IMPRESSED.
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Three young Israeli Mossad agents are sent to Germany in 1965 to capture a notorious Nazi war criminal, a doctor who viciously performed atrocious experiments upon Jewish prisoners, but something goes wrong and the Nazi escapes. The three decide to cover up the mistake and claim that they killed the man. Now, thirty years later a man has surfaced who claims that he is that doctor.<br /><br />The movie is based on a Hebrew book called Hachov. This title can be translated as \\"The Debt\\" or as \\"The Obligation.\\" I think that the latter translation captures the dilemma of the three agents better. The retired agents take three approaches to their problem. One feels an obligation to take revenge for the murders that the doctor did to Jews and other Nazis did to members of his family. One focuses on the obligation of morality, what is right and wrong, despite the harm that what she considers right may do to others. The third focuses on the obligation to be practical, to do what makes sense, to consider the impact their behavior will have on family and country.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|An old Chinese proverb states if you want a love in marriage, marry for a year. But if you want love that will last a life time, take up gardening. I did not read the book, so I do not really know why the author named his work The Constant Gardner, but I interpret the film as saying that Ralph Fiennes loved Rachel Weisz, the two stars in the show, with a love that is as strong as the gardener in the Chinese proverb. However, another interpretation of the title may be that while Rachel, a lawyer-activist in Kenya, is very active in her pursuit involving people, Ralph, a British government official, is somewhat passive, and although certainly loving Rachel, is generally uninvolved with people and more interested in his gardening. Whether I am right or wrong, the interpretations I give to the title, I think, captures some of the main characteristics of this fine film.<br /><br /> Without divulging the intricacies of the plot, it focuses on the fact that Rachel is found shot to death. This awakens Ralph, who feels remorse for not knowing what Rachel was involved in, and bothered by rumors of her infidelity, decides to find out everything about her and who killed her. He discovers a far-reaching high-level conspiracy, far more complex than he ever imagined.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|This is a suspense-filled, action-thriller, real-life depiction of a despicable chapter of the dark side of US political life, a story of how thousands of lives were lost due to lies that underpinned the Iraq War and how one family who revealed the lie were destroyed by officials in the American White House, perhaps by direction of the president or vice president of the United States. The story is well-known and is dramatized very well in this film.<br /><br /> President Bush insisted that the US should bomb Iraq because the country has weapons of mass destruction. A retired American ambassador was asked by the CIA to look into the matter and found that this was not true. President Bush ignored the CIA finding and insisted that Iraq had such weapons and had the US military attack Iraq. The ambassador published an article in a newspaper stating that there were no such weapons. The White House admitted that he was correct, but childishly and inappropriately struck back at the ambassador by illegally revealing that his wife was an undercover CIA agent. The film shows how this White House action destroyed the innocent woman's career, placed great strains upon her marriage, and forced the CIA to abandon the non-American agents that worked under her, many of whom lost their lives.

B000A2UBN4|5.0|This is a classic thriller by the famed director Martin Scorsese starring Robert De Niro as a crazed ex-con determined to take revenge against his defense attorney who failed to give him a proper defense. As a result, De Niro's character had to spend 14 years in prison and lost his wife and child. De Niro hounds the lawyer and frightens him and his family. The lawyer tries several ways to get rid of De Niro without success. The film was first made in 1960 and starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck, who have cameo roles in this remake. The excellent film is very well acted and is filled with gripping terror that builds emotions to a fever pitch in a crescendo of suspense.
B00181JGI2|5.0|This movie is one of the best of all time. I bet I have seen it 20 times and still enjoy it when its on.
B006VP1OYO|3.0|I was so excited to see that Amazon was carrying this.  I try to support my local indie stores, but they didn't have it, so thank you, Amazon. The music is of course wonderful, MBV is my all time favorite band.  Starting listening to them in 1991, and seeing them live was one of my favorite music experiences ever.  I really liked getting the extra tracks.  I had heard them before, but it is nice to actually own them now.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a much improved listening experience, this isn't it.  No I don't have a great sound system, yes I loaded it on my computer.  I know the true audiophiles are probably turning up their noses, but really, except for maybe being a little louder, there is very little difference.<br /><br />I don't usually get remasters, but I was so impressed with Johnny Marr's remastering of the Smiths catalog I figured there was a good chance Kevin Shields would be able to work similar magic.  Of course to be fair, the Smith's had a lot more room for improvement, especially on their earlier stuff.  But I was hoping that the MBV remasters would be able to capture the same expansiveness of the Smiths remasters while also retaining that wall of noise feel.  The wall of noise is still there, but it isn't much difference from the original wall of noise.<br /><br />So, if you never had the EPs or the extra tracks, I would definitely recommend getting this.  If, on the other hand, you are hoping for a much improved remaster, this is not it.  Five stars for the music, two stars for a remaster that isn't much different than the original.
006197806X|4.0|I am not often impressed by the second books in series.  Usually they are placeholders and barely move the plot along, causing me to wonder why there aren't more two book series.  However, Pandemonium did not disappoint.  I loved the non-linear story telling - how the author switched back and forth between then and now.  This allowed her the freedom to foreshadow current events with enlightenments from the past.  It moved the story along and afforded the reader perspectives that would have been missed by telling the story from start to finish.  It also made for a page-turning reading pace. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 (although maybe 4.5 would be more accurate) because many of the outcomes and revelations were quite predictable.  I did think that the themes of love and hate being emotions with similar motivations and good and evil not being black and white, were important and timely.  The final events of the book set up what is sure to be a great finale to the series!
1591795230|1.0|This book should not be under \\"Science\\" but under \\"New Age Stupidity\\".  This is not about science at all.  It's a combination of scientific vocabulary and pure and plain stupidity at the most basic level.  It is not science because the author does not \\"prove\\" anything.  He simply sets certain beliefs not subject to scrutiny or tests.  People, please stop reading these fraudsters who claim to have \\"alternative truths\\" that the \\"scientific community\\" does not accept. The true scientists are always willing to accept they are wrong and that there are new things that we didn't imagine could be true.  Einstein's general relativity theory proved that Newton was wrong (or, at least, that his laws were not accurate enough at a certain level). Then Einstein himself was wrong when he imagined a static Universe. And all this was subject to scientific testing, with predictions that were proven to work again and again.  That is science at its best.  This guy tries to convince us that he has \\"discovered\\" something revolutionary, and tries to obtain authority by borrowing scientific jargon.  Come on ...

B004EQAVHI|4.0|If you are emotional or easily depressed this movie is not for you.  It pulls on every emotional heartstring and sometimes I am not sure it wasn't done as a cheap way of getting a reaction.  The slaughter of the innocents with some dystopian touches.  Whatever, it does not make a difference, this movie is heartbreaking.  The scene where they are in the restaurant with the other couple who had heard a rumor, and the reaction of the woman after speaking to the three main characters is tragic.  If we truly live in such a world where these kinds of values are paramount, and there is so little regard for life and such selfishness and greed, this world has no hope.  Given the history of the 20th century, this movie might be saying that we may be living in that world already.  That is the terrifying part.

1594744769|4.0|This was a great story with magic and intrigue. I wanted more of a climax and resolution at the end, but all-in-all a great read. Loved the inclusion of the antique photos. Would definitely recommend reading this book with the hard copy rather than on a Kindle for that reason.

B004VUP8WK|2.0|Jesus Tapdancing Christ, I don't mind when a band tries different things and grows organically over time. King Crimson and Voivod come immediately to mind. Even when an artist goes off the deep end so to speak I can be counted on to go along for the ride so long as that detour is honest or of high quality. Artists follow their own muse. But this album sounds neither honest, nor is it of any quality other than questionable. The music \\"evolution\\" on Illud Divinum Insanus sounds forced, dated and I hate to say it, cynically commercial and even worse: art-less.<br /><br />So the guys wanted to incorporate industrial sounds into their music, so be it. Destructhor, Morbid's new guitarist was in Zykon and those guys effectively melded industrial with extreme metal. It can be done, and done well. The problem is that the industrial/techno songs on this album stink. From the silly one note pounding rhythm of the laughable Too Extreme! to the gabber like annoyance of Profundis - Mea Culpa, Morbid Angel's idea of industrial is not only dated but simplistic and musically under-develoved.<br /><br />The lyrics aren't any better either. Radikult, with its exhortations to \\"killa cop\\", an idea covered by Ice-T about 20 years ago and now sung by 40 something year old men, sounds like a pathetic effort to prove how radical a band they are to their perceived audience. And judging from the lyrical depth of other songs like \\"I Am Morbid\\", their fist-pump anthem, Morbid Angel thinks their audience is about 16. Sad, but these guys now sound like a dad-band version of what they once were: radical extreme metal. I think their muse is gone. Perhaps David Vincent's return wasn't really such a good thing.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs on the album, not earth shatteringly revelatory but decent: Existo Vulgore, Blades For Baal, Nevermore and perhaps Beauty Meets Beast. They add nothing new to their canon but at least sound like Morbid Angel and aren't embarrassing like Destructos Vs. The Earth. BTW judging from YouTube videos of the band playing live, many of the cool guitar solos are Destructhor's and not Trey Azagthoth. While there is some nice guitar work from both players, its not enough to save the cd from being a collection of Anthems to the Poopkin at Noon.. The Earth.

B005FISBTO|1.0|If Michael C. Hall and the rest of the cast and production team have any conscience, then Season 7 of Dexter will be one episode that is two minutes long.  That episode will begin with all living characters sitting in a room, looking apologetically at the camera.<br /><br />Dexter will be standing with the characters.  Dexter will walk around the room, shooting each of the characters in the head.  Dexter will then turn to the camera, say \\"I am sorry for Season 6\\" and then shoot himself.<br /><br />The credits will then begin to roll, but the credits will only say \\"We Are Sorry.\\"<br /><br />This is the worst season of anything, ever.  No show has ever dropped off the deep end so precipitously.  This makes season 6 of 24 look like The Godfather.<br /><br />This is worse than Highlander 2, worse than Police Academy 7, worse than Friday the 13th: Jason in Space.<br /><br />When you are watching the show and actually feeling ashamed for the writers, you know they have lost the plot.  They had literally no respect for the character traits that had been carefully crafted in the previous seasons.  Dexter just does what he feels like at the moment and gets away with it because he is now both really stupid and really lucky.<br /><br />Laguerta is detestable.  Deb is mega-detestable.  Quinn is unwatchable.  I seriously wanted every character to die by the end of the season.<br /><br />The only decent thing in the entire rotten exercise was Edward James Olmos, who stepped aboard this sinking ship way too late.  And he is the element most people were complaining about.  His calm delivery is the only thing that kept any of this cesspool even temporarily watchable.<br /><br />On the other hand, Tom Hanks' kid was brutal, and he is the one garnering praise from what I can tell.  Are you kidding me?  Watch for his stellar \\"Sybil-inspired\\" performance after the \\"big reveal.\\"<br /><br />I will watch the first two minutes of Season 7 and if it is anything other than my recommended plotline, I am turning the TV off immediately.  I don't see how the people involved can live with themselves if they film anything other than my suggestion.
0143117564|4.0|While some have said this was a simple sit down, dive in, and finish easily book, I would have to disagree. Inherent Vice for readers born after the 60s offers a tricky plotline to follow. Thankfully we have a magnificent leader in Pynchon to guide us through this psychedelic time warp. Like Magellan navigating the tricky straights of the southern point of South America, Pynchon navigates through all of the major conflicts of the 60s, and does so with ease through his character of Doc Sportello.<br />Doc Sportello is a Private Investigator, and public genius. To the police on payroll, he is classified as nothing more than a hippie vagrant like everyone else living in the Venice Beach area of Hollywood where his practice is located. But to the hippies, he is a regular Sherlock Holmes. While this doesn't hit on specifics like the Kent State Massacre, the difference between peace loving civilians and the police department is clearly shown. This key difference offers en extreme historical significance, adding to the underlying theme of the book.<br />Doc is introduced going about his daily business when he is interrupted by an ex-girlfriend, Shasta. As Shasta and he reconnect he discovers her new boyfriend, a billionaire construction mogul, will go missing and Doc is asked to help. A construction mogul having a billion dollars seems a bit outrageous, especially for the 60's, but Pynchon does everything for a reason. The loss of power and money in LA, and the introduction of corruption and deceit, represents as a whole, a new idea of how things are working in America in the 60's. As Doc attempts to discover his whereabouts hilarity ensues. Pynchon's trick to unraveling the 60's without becoming too political or factual is to use comedy to mask the deeper meaning. Doc is a peace loving hippy trying to find a straight edge, money loving mogul. This ying-yang difference is what creates the humor as Doc battles guns with weed, and uses love as a tactic to gather evidence.<br/>The genius behind Doc, excluding Pynchon, is his near addiction to smoking weed. His marijuana usage helps bring to life the psychosis of the 60s in the writing and plot line. He's not simply corrupting his lungs when he indulges on Vietnamese weed; rather, Pynchon is stating something of much bigger historical significance. But to Doc, everything is just a haze. The ambiguity of the case presents a parallel to Doc's hazy thoughts. He is able to float the line between a serious detective and a laughable hippie all thanks to his favorite herb. Overall though, it is Pynchon's ability to float the line between the serious issues of the 1960's and the hilarity of a story with a character that rivals the pink panther, that makes this book truly a great read.

0670023329|5.0|Once I started \\"Escape from Camp 14,\\" I could not put it down.  Although I was familiar with the inhumane and brutal treatment of North Korean prisoners, Shin's autobiography put these atrocities in a new light.  North Koreans have been brainwashed for over 50 years, made to believe anyone the state deems an enemy (even a child) is worthy of the most brutal punishment.  Shin's story reflects this taken to the most severe degree: children born into an environment with no morality, no humanity, and no love.<br /><br />The story moves fast, taking the reader from Shin's earliest memories, through his trials in the camp as a youth, and his escape from the prison and on to South Korea.  However, what is most remarkable (beyond his will to survive) is the slow realization that there is indeed a world beyond the fences.  Shin knew nothing beyond the hell of the camp, the torture, pain.  He had nothing to miss from the outside.  What would happen if that knowledge invaded his space?  The knowledge that there is more?<br /><br />The writing is clear and to the point, journalistic but not without emotional heft.  Harden provides some information on the North Korean state.  This will help readers who are less familiar with this isolated nation.  While Shin's trials and pains in the camp are shocking and sad, I was most moved by his struggle to heal and find himself in this world, a world foreign to him in every imaginable way.  I highly recommend this book.  It makes you confront the larger questions such as: when are human beings culpable for our actions? Are people innately good (I'm starting to wonder)? Perhaps most significantly, once North Korea falls, how long will it take and what will be required to rehabilitate a nation traumatized and terrorized for 50 years?
0553582038|2.0|Being a big fan of the first 3 books and the TV series I was willing to look past the negative reviews for this book.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.  Not much actually happens in this book, and the Cersie and Brianne storylines, which are the majority of this book, are incredibly boring.  I hope the next book is better, although the initial reviews for it don't appear promising.  Might take a break from the book series for awhile.

B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is a great comic series for those of us who love zombie thrillers! Well illustrated and a fun read. I actually got into this comic one the show \\"Walking Dead\\" aired. I hadn't realized it was a comic beforehand and now that I do, I'm a fan of the comic as well. They are awesome to read on a digital reader but a pain in the ass to read on a smartphone. SO SMALL! and NO ZOOM! I need to get a tablet...I can only imagine how badass it will be on a tablet. I have a kindle but since it's the black and white version it doesn't give the option to download to read on those kinds of kindles. boo! Still give it a 5 star though.

0439023491|5.0|What an awesome read and a great cliff-hanger. Can't wait to start book 3. I stayed up too late reading on several occasions! I have to admit that I didn't love it as much as the first one but Suzanna Collins did an amazing job and I started reading book 3 within a day or two of finishing this one because I have to know how it ends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read to be entertained.  And this book was very entertaining.  It did a very good job of picking up from the last book and contuining with the story and the characters.  There was a lot action, twist and turns.  If people are expecting the next great novel --- look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a good read -- pick up this 2nd book and enjoy the story.
0439023513|4.0|wow! it ended almost exactly like I thought it would, well hoped it would, but the twists it took before getting there were incredible. Usually when a series ends the way I predict it leaves me frustrated (like the Twilight series) but in this case I was very satisfied with how everything worked out and with how Suzanne Collins got everyone to where they ended up. I'm sure I will be thinking about this ending for days, asking \\"Real or not real?\\"<br /><br />As much as I loved all three books, Mockingjay started off a little too slow for me, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Still it was a great read and I'm sad that it is over.
B002S0OBMS|3.0|Vocally, I love Ramin Karimloo, except that the Phantom should sound/be older and have a darker voice, in line with the original story by Gaston Leroux.  That's my general opinion, nothing against Ramin's talent.<br /><br />Musically, there are some lovely melodies here, regardless of whether they have been recycled or not.  The problem is that you have to listen to some awful dialogue and lyrics to get to many of them.  Thank God for editing software so the songs that I do like that have portions that ruin them can be edited into an MP3 worth listening to.<br /><br />For example, **SPOILER** the Phantom confronts Christine after he figures out that Gustave is his son.  Christine starts to sing a reprise of, \\"Once Upon Another Time...\\" and in the middle of it, the Phantom says, \\"My own flesh and blood, and even he recoils in horror from me...just like his mother.\\" \\"Just like his mother\\"?  Laughable!  Obviously, the producers of the Australian production must have thought the same because that line was changed to \\"...as you did once.\\"  Simple change, so much better.  Anyway, through the magic of editing, that line is gone in my MP3 file.<br /><br />I bought the deluxe, 3-CD version, which isn't worth it, unless you are a die-hard fan of the show.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got a Kindle Fire for my birthday and this is the first book I borrowed from the Kindle Library. I am so glad I did. It was beyond awesome! I'd give it 6 stars if I could. This was a lightning quick read. Several times I read way too late and was only half conscious at work the next day.<br /><br />What can I say without giving too much away? Katniss is the kind of girl to aspire to be. Honest, filled with integrity, not willing to follow the crowd that she doesn't agree with, yet able to see the good in people that aren't like her.<br /><br />And I'm just a huge Peeta fan. I swear, had his name not been pulled, he probably would have volunteered just to protect her.
0345803485|1.0|... ashamed that I fell for an age-old con. Based on the \\"buzz,\\" I impulsively bought the first book.<br /><br />/Preface/ If you remain determined to find a trilogy for the summer, I cannot recommend enough the erotic (yes! it is!), spellbinding [[ASIN:0307595579 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Deluxe Boxed Set: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, Plus On Stieg Larsson]] /End Preface/<br /><br />The best erotic fiction is fantastical and yet believable enough to stir one's own inner (albeit forbidden) erotic fantasies to the extent that one has to touch one's own body, at first in secrecy, particularly for weeks, months, even years following the consuming reading experience. From the first paragraph of an erotic masterpiece, [[ASIN:0679723161 Lolita, 50th Anniversary Edition]]<br /><br />  Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta.<br />  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate<br />  to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.<br /><br />Compared to the first sentences of the long first paragraph of [[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br /><br />  I scowl with frustration at myself in the mirror. Damn my hair--<br />  it just won't behave, and damn Katherine Kavanagh for being ill<br />  and subjecting me to this ordeal. I should be studying for my<br />  final exams, which are next week, yet here I am trying to brush<br />  my hair into submission. <EM>I must not sleep with it wet</em> ...  (her \\"mantra\\" - yes, E. L. James used that word)<br /><br />James knows so little about modern-day sexual experience among college-age students that she wants us to believe that Ana has never touched herself, let alone touched herself with the goal of achieving orgasm. EVERY mentally-healthy young woman cannot wait to find out what an orgasm feels like. A longtime best friend like Kate, who is portrayed as persistently bossy, would have never let Ana graduate and enter the \\"real world\\" without having had an orgasm. If all verbal persistence had failed, Kate would have purchased a dildo for Ana with one or two words. I'd choose \\"gentle\\" and \\"explore\\" -- and not let up until Ana had turned that dildo on.<br /><br />Besides, I cannot believe Ana has not experienced a female erection while reading fiction. My god, even in the tiny rural town I grew up in, a single copy of Terry Southern's \\"Candy\\" made its way to every girl in my class and even to me, surprising because I wasn't an \\"in\\" girl. Its effect on me was as physical as it was mental. And its scenes gave me enough fantasy material to keep me entertained for years.<br /><br />Where were \\"Tom Jones\\" and \\"Moll Flanders\\" in Ana's college education? Where was Chaucer? And don't tell me that she never read \\"Lolita,\\" Nabokov's triumph of eroticism, desire, obsession, and complete mastery -- astonishing for a non-native American and non-native speaker/writer of English -- of a factually and linguistically perfect description of 1939 America and Americans.<br /><br />If James read \\"Lolita,\\" she'd have figured out that Nabokov traveled in an automobile everywhere Humbert Humbert went, painstakingly detailing what he saw and heard. Nabokov never had to ask his readers to suspend disbelief. He transported every American reader to a world they knew instinctively as their very own. Every sentient reader effortlessly believed what Nabokov wrote about his characters and their surroundings.<br /><br />Why does James not realize that Ana's supposed innocence is in fact psychologically and physically abnormal? That no mentally healthy Ana could be separated from her body without a physical abnormality or psychological trauma severe enough to disconnect her from every whole young woman's natural desire and sexual reflexes that are impossible to suppress?  Why does the author presume she can get away with having us believe that no mentally healthy Ana ever found any male student, T.A. (teaching assistant), and/or professor so desirable that she effortlessly had fantasies about them and let them near her?<br /><br />How can James make us believe that no male student, T.A. and/or professor was overwhelmed by her physical appearance, her confidence, her sense of humor, and her smarts that he could not help but throw himself at her which, if she were psychologically normal, she would find immensely pleasurable and sexually responsive (to varying degrees)?<br /><br />And how about those customers at the hardware store? Men who work construction are sometimes unusually hot -- that's why the male lover in many great romance novels (Lady Chatterly's Lover, anyone?) have manual jobs.<br /><br />Besides construction workers sure to visit that hardware store regularly, the larger area is populated by commercial fishermen, loggers, professional divers, U.S. Coast Guard search & rescue teams who risk (and lose) their lives in the *dangerous* waters of the Columbia River and the Pacific Ocean. Then there are Native Americans descendants of nearby tiny but independent tribes whose men raided each other's tribes, stealing and enslaving women. Those eyes, those cheekbones. Their feline, silent moves. Their need to go back in time, perhaps even conquering others' women.<br /><br />The crass displays of capitalism are amusing, from a British writer who has no clue that, in the greater Seattle area, those with real money NEVER display their wealth. As the son of two wealthy, socially prominent parents and surrounded by the wealthy parents of classmates, Christian would know (if James knew) that only the nouveau riche would drive a flashy sports car. I've seen Bill Gates in many settings, and never once did he indicate in any way that he had a penny but for the location of his seat at Sonics basketball games. Even his car was purposely a typical mid-size beige sedan, and he drove himself everywhere.<br /><br />Furthermore, Bill Gates would have never given his girlfriend (later his wife) an automobile that screamed \\"MONEY!!!\\"  Why not?  For safety: To avoid her becoming an easy target of car thieves, kidnappers, rapists, and police or troopers with unhealthy sexual needs.<br /><br />A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OF ESSENTIALS UNACHIEVED IN BOOK ONE -- ESSENTIALS INDISPUTABLY TAUGHT BEFORE OR DURING ANY HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN READING CLASS:<br /><br />These two reviews address problems I chose to omit from my own commentary:<br />(1)  An older man on truckling March 7, 2012<br />By david shobin/thatch pond corp<br />(2)  Bestseller? Really??? March 25, 2012<br />By DS from LA<br /><br />These two Amazon customers -- and several more -- have described, better than I, the problems with the writing, for which a student in Creative Writing 101 might receive a gentleman's C but deserves a D minus. And David Shobin's expertise as a gynecologist gives his observations credibility (and his concern about warts -- well!).<br /><br />What is book one's most egregious fault? It is not creative; it fails to achieve the necessary \\"suspension of disbelief.\\" (Is \\"suspension of disbelief\\" a new term? It means exactly what it says. It is the key that unlocks the door, giving your imagination access to the novelist's imagination and, if it is great literature, your imaginations join as one.)<br /><br />Book No. 1 deserves an F for its crass ending written solely to make gullible readers rush to buy the second book. If you fear you might be gullible, rent \\"The Grifters,\\" an excellent film that will show you how first-rate con artists work, including the most difficult con of all, a con that works perfectly on an otherwise first-rate con artist. Thereafter, you will be protected by your familiarity with how first-rate con artists masterfully execute complex plots that can only work because they also understand the human psyche more than most psychiatrists. Then, you will thereafter see E.L. James as an amateur, actually a con wannabe.<br /><br />It's human to desire a \\"naughty\\" book. It's particularly sad I fell for this con since I should know better. But I was gullible. I hadn't unpacked my collection of great literature in a long while. I needed to touch and open my special books. Such as Nabokov's memoir, \\"Speak, Memory\\" and his masterpiece of erotic longings:<br /><br />  Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta.<br />  The tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate<br />  to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee.

0061692042|5.0|\\"First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.\\" That's the first two lines of the book.<br /><br />Beyond the vast ocean of Saskatchewanian wheat fields, burrowed with the detritus of past lives and half-lives, a fifteen-year-old boy is marooned on a forgotten prairie land with fugitives and transients, like a scrap of driftwood or a windblown, bone-cracked bottle. His surname is a mystery for twelve chapters; it's released, finally, like a swift, soft teardrop.<br /><br />Ford's great American/Canadian novel is a coming-of-age adventure tale about realizing one's own identity through narrative, memories, and self-examination. Moreover, it's about crossing, dissolving, and abnegating boundaries, physically as well as psychically, and generating rapport between our internal selves and the external world. At the heart of this story are the borders we cross and the crosses we bear. Symbolic, too, is that Saskatchewan is the only Canadian province with no geographic physical properties to denote boundaries. The abandoned young Montanan hero redefines divisions and indivisible spaces with deep reflection.<br /><br />\\"If anything, the similarity to America made its foreignness profound...\\"<br /><br />This half of a twin, living as if he were an orphan, tells us his story with tender wit and optimism amidst the garbage heap of objects and dwellings inhabited by outlaws and goose hunters. He was taught to \\"always know something that I could relinquish.\\" And he was able to see the world as its opposite, and draw strength from that.<br /><br />The view of melting pot America ultimately merges with the cultural mosaic of Canada, and becomes a theme. In lesser hands, many aspects of this book could have seemed repetitive, tautological, but Ford amplifies the meaning of every revolving concept by mining it to its irreducible essence. Nothing is diminished in this masterpiece. The themes are potent, and not diluted with hollow slogans.<br /><br />The story's hero narrates dramatic, life-changing events that happened to him and his twin sister, Berner, after their parents robbed a North Dakota bank in 1960. The twins' father, Beverly Parsons, was an Air Force bombardier from Alabama, a smiling, talkative, self-serving handsome six-footer who returned from the war ultimately misunderstanding the world he came home to, and unsuited to the woman he fell in love with. But he embraced all that America stood for.<br /><br />Mother, Neeva, was a bespectacled intellectual from Tacoma, the daughter of educated Jewish immigrants, a woman who didn't want to assimilate with the people and land of Montana. The mismatch of parents created a terrible, unresolved tension that was chronicled in Neeva's journal and left as part of a legacy of loneliness for the children to untangle or inherit.<br /><br />This nerve-shattering story is filled with vivid incidents and characters alike, propelled by charm and clarity, provocative as it is diverting. Short, fluent chapters maintain a lyrical, vibrating rhythm. It is accessible, engaging, eloquently woven and plotted, not one word out of place, not one event unnecessary. The prose is unprepossessing and yet noble, austere but lush, stark yet playful, elegiac but bright, polished with all the messiness of life.<br /><br />It moves with the alacrity of a gazelle, spins together with effortless grace. As radiant and moving as a cinnamon sun and as sublime as a silver moon. This is a sensuous departure from the Frank Bascombe novels. The understated narrator's voice is flawlessly vulnerable, wry, and lightly brushed with a mournful surrender.<br /><br />As an addendum, I read that Ford is planning to write more novels set in Canada. According to Harper Collins, \\"We are thrilled to be publishing the first of Ford's novels to be set in this country\\" (north of the 49th parallel).llow slogans.<br /><br />The story's hero narrates dramatic, life-changing events that happened to him and his twin sister, Berner, after their parents robbed a North Dakota bank in 1960.

I loved entering into the futuristic world and seeing how things could get out of hand if we were no longer given free choice.  Not being able to choose who you wed, or a job, or being able to freely love.  These thoughtful images had me thinking as I listened.  I have read this book around five times now.  I truly enjoy it and recommend it!

1400049628|5.0|Bought this book after reading world war z just for kicks. I enjoyed WWZ more because of its story and alternate reality, or how the world might end up due to a pandemic such as the zombie virus.<br /><br />This book however was more instructional, and entertaining. Though, if you are taking it seriously you might not see the humor in it. Still, it IS useful reading \\"just because\\". I mean, why not, right? There are some good general survival tips in here that made me want to start making my own BOB (bug out bag) to be ready for anything, just in case.<br /><br />Either way, it's up to the reader to take something away from it. A fun read on one hand and a prep guide on the other.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I am a bit puzzled by the negative reviews of this book but everyone is certainly entitled to their opinion and we all look for different things in what we read. Maybe I was in the right frame of mind for this book. First off, I appreciated the wit and heart of this story. Some of the one liners were laugh out loud funny. The photos were fascinating and I looked forward to each new one. AS for the story, I am not really giving away anything to tell you that this is obviously the first installment in a much larger tale, in which the fate of the world will hang upon the success of an intrepid group of very special children, that will span great distances, cross dimensions and flow through worm-holes in time. But I think it is more than that. It is also a story about regret, loss, and the choices we make and how we deal with the consequences of those choices. I am looking forward to future installments.
B003U0I9TQ|5.0|I already owned the original release of the Sigh No More CD and the Sigh No More Deluxe Edition (Live At Shepherds Bush Empire). So when I found out that they had another live album out I had to have it. Even though I already own two copies of the original CD it wasn't going to stop me from buying it again. Mumford & Sons are just as amazing live as they are in the studio. Even there is only 5 songs on the live CD in this it is awesome. They are crisp and clear tracks. Beautiful! So now I have three copies of Sigh No More and will definately buy a fourth if they ever release Sigh No More with another live CD. I don't think they will though.<br />Mumford & Sons are always worth buying any CD they are a part of. Hopefully when they release their new album they will release several more live stuff with it!<br />Buy this item if you like Mumford & Sons! You will not be dissapoiinted.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi by Yann Martel is an adventure novel, about an Indian boy named Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel. It was published in September of 2001 by Knopf Canada, and since then has won several literacy awards.<br /> Pi grew up in India, where his family had been zookeepers. He enjoyed walking through the zoo every day, on his way to school, and observing the animals. He loved swimming and religion. He loved God, and wanted to serve him in as many ways as he could. He was born a Hindu, and became a Christian and a Muslim.<br />His family decided to move to Canada, but became shipwrecked in the middle of the voyage. Pi found himself on a lifeboat, with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, a Bengal tiger, and had to struggle for survival.<br />I found the excessive detail Martel used about Pi's life before he boarded the ship both problematic, and interesting. At face value, the detail in the beginning of the book was very boring, and this is a problem because people might not want to read this book if it starts off that way. I found it boring how he goes into much detail about how Pi loved swimming, the animals, and religion, while the only important factor of these three, is his love of animals. He might've ended up in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, but didn't step off the boat, other than the times he went to his makeshift raft. Even then it doesn't mention that his swimming when he was younger helped him in any way. He prayed on the boat, but it wouldn't have changed the story much if Martell had left that out.<br />After the introduction, however, the story is very interesting. He takes the reader inside Pi's head, and tells him exactly how Pi feels about every situation. When Pi is bored on the boat, Martel writes the book to sound a bit dull. When Pi is excited, the book becomes thrilling. He shows the reader what a brave, moral, and intelligent person, Pi is, by letting us feel all the sorrow Pi feels, as he kills and eats his first fish, and how smart and courageous he was to be able to train Richard Parker.<br />After having read the book, it becomes apparent how much the detail in the beginning of the book adds to the storyline. The very fact that the things he loved, the animals and the water, could have ended up being his nightmare for 227 days. His foreshadowing was very discrete and tasteful, as foreshadowing should be. However, it was also boring, and made the first part of the book dull and uneventful.<br />I was also confused as to whether the animals in this book had been real or not. When Pi had been explaining his story to the Japanese men at the end of the story, he changed the orangutan to his mother, the zebra to a sailor, the hyena to the cook, and the tiger to himself. It left me wondering whether or not he had been telling the story with animals just as a way to express it.<br />I would recommend this book to be read in a school setting. There is a lot of depth to this book that a single person reading it won't pick up on his own, but rather would be brought up in a discussion with others.<br />This book teaches a valuable lesson about life. About how even when things are as bad as Pi's situation, it's always worth it to keep fighting, because things will look up eventually.<br />Also, things are easier to get through, if you have company, even if that company is a Bengal Tiger. If you have people suffering alongside you, and depending on you, it becomes more apparent how giving up is a selfish act.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless, by Eric Blehm, is a moving and amazing true story.  It chronicles the life of Adam Brown, a member of Seal Team SIX, from his youth, through his addiction to crack and a stay in jail, into his training as a Seal, and concluding with his death on a mission in Afghanistan .  I don't quite know how to summarize this book.  Adam was a fearless, determined kid who exhibited tremendous kindness towards others.  After high school, he began making poor decisions that resulted in an almost overwhelming drug addiction that finally landed him in jail.  While living at a rehab facility, Adam accepted Christ as his savior.  Following rehab, Adam met his eventual wife, Kelley, and made the decision to become a Navy Seal.  This is a very general description, but I can't do justice to the experiences portrayed in the book.  Blehm interviewed a number of people who knew Adam, including his fellow Seals and commanding officers.  A pretty complete picture of Adam Brown is presented, and he is a tremendous example of a man, husband, father, friend, and warrior.  This is a fascinating story, but the last few chapters are hard to read, due to the emotional content, particularly for this father of young children.<br /><br />I highly recommend this encouraging story of redemption and courage, and the saving power of Christ.  A warning though, that there is a little bit of \\"salty\\" language due to the nature of the men interviewed.  It is never inappropriate, but it is in there.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah's Blogging for Books program in exchange for an honest review.
0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild, by Jon Krakauer is a non-fiction story, about the adventure of Chris McCandless. After Chris graduated from college he decided to journey into the wild in search of adventure, and to bond with nature. He donated 25,000 dollars to charity; left his home and family behind, took a couple of supplies, renamed himself Alexander Supertramp, and began his adventure. He met some friends who helped him find food, and drove him to his next destination. He found some temporary jobs, but he didn't stay in one place for extended periods of time. He traveled into the Alaskan wilderness for his ultimate adventure, and was found dead in an abandoned bus on Stampede Trail.<br /> This was a very interesting book, and a quick read. Krakauer vividly describes Alex's surroundings making you feel as if you were there, hiking alongside him. This story makes you really appreciate all of the luxuries and necessities that we take for granted, such as a place to live, and food to eat.<br /> Living completely of the land for as long as Chris did was a very difficult task, and we have to respect him for that. Yet, we can learn from Chris; we can learn not to act as he did, and to label him a fool. He took very few supplies on his journey, and didn't honestly consider the dangers of traveling Alaska. There was no emergent medical help available, and the chances for his survival were very slim. Alexander was indeed a very brave fool.<br /> Into the Wild was a very exciting, beautifully written book, and very hard to put down. It helps you remember not to take all of the luxuries in your life for granted, and to value your life. Value it more than at least Chris McCandless did. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in non-fiction, or the wilderness. Jon Krakauer did a very good job capturing the life of the foolish but brave Alexander Supertramp.

1401235417|5.0|This trade collects Batman 1-7 (2011-12).<br /><br />There was a lot of uncertainty going into DC's New 52 and what was essentially a reset of all of their titles.  Scott Snyder has made the most of the opportunity by presenting a Batman story that captures familiar characters well for long time readers while building a compelling new story that's a good starting point for new ones.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is looking to the future, looking to rebuild derelict areas of Gotham's industrial district and supporting an altruistic new candidate for mayor.  But Gotham's past isn't finished with Wayne nor Batman, and an old legend and nursery rhyme may hold some secrets for the man who thinks he rules the city...<br /><br />Snyder does a wonderful job building his story and letting things unravel at the proper speed.  This tale is dark, and is obviously leading to another volume, but it's also engrossing and introduces a legitimate threat.<br /><br />The art here is fantastic.  From action scenes to facial expressions to a myriad of subtle (and not-so-subtle) artistic effects everything is spot on and elevates an already impressing story.<br /><br />A great start for one of DC's flagship titles following the reboot, Court of Owls is an easy recommendation for any comic fan who doesn't mind a grim tale.

B006VFLIYK|3.0|Spoiler alert, sort of... sort of not... Let it suffice to say that world class hyper-military, vigilante, good-guy assassin and FBI hotshot/hot-to-trot/hotty fail to see the obvious until the precocious 14-year old chicky points out to them, and the bad guy, that a platoon has more than three soldiers.  This revelation, it turns out, is her death warrant, and will she live to see tomorrow??  Who knows what other dark secrets she may reveal?<br /><br />How an otherwise fairly well crafted page-turner could hinge the plot on that nonsense is beyond me, but I don't write 'em (and I suspect he doesn't either, but they all do that, right?).  I guess that is a \\"spoiler,\\" technically, although it's so obvious that it will spoil nothing for any reader paying attention.  Also, I easily guessed who was pulling the strings, as the author has a way of \\"wink-wink-ing\\" little details so you don't lose track later.  And I pretty much guessed who the bad-guy assassin would turn out to be, based at least partly on its implausibility.  Right again.  I read a Baldacci book some time ago and I think I had the same general impression.  Entertaining, if you suspend disbelief sufficiently, but it may require some effort.

B00005S6K8|5.0|I saw this in my teen's, and fell in love with the characters, the story, and the beautiful score. Now in middle age, its still one of my most favorites, my kids even love watching it because the story line is so smooth, flowy, and the characters so charasmatic. I think this is much better than the original, but no one comes close to Audrey Hepburn though...still I will say Julia did a fantastic job..
B007ZJDGXC|3.0|It was a good movie but not great.  Much was made of Frost as the ultra spook in the beginning of the movie and that was where this movie goes awry.  It devolved quickly into an action film rather than a thriller. I expected the plot to utilize his psychological skills; pitting him against the CIA; but instead it became one long chase seen with no real surprises.  Safe movie, guaranteed payday with Washington as lead, but disappointing.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like the case in the sense that it is protective. It stands pretty well and overall functions as it should. However, I dislike the fabric cover. I've only had it a short time and it's got little fuzzies all over it already. If you have animals that shed it gets covered with hair and is hard to get off. I think maybe a microfiber or suede one would suite my needs better.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This is my first review its a shame its a negative one.<br />Three very long books leading to this one had me hooked into the lives of the main characters, good and evil. He wove a tale that had me believing that good characters did bad things and the most corrupted could find redemption in good actions. Then he threw that all out the window and marched along on a new pace - one of inaction, tensionless drolling, and monotonous diaries. All this while ignoring the characters we most wanted to hear about.<br />Felt let down and disappointed, never mind onward and upward to more books immediatly!
1594203334|5.0|As new parents, my husband are I are surrounded by a wide variety of parenting styles, influences, and forms of advice.  This book offers none of those; rather, Druckerman simply notes the profound differences between American and French parenting, and as a result, the children themselves.  The culture around us seems to embrace parenting that caters to the child in (what seems to us) unhealthy ways.  In contrast, Druckerman's observations point toward a parenting style that is both warm and authoritative, lenient yet structured.  She doesn't necessarily give pointers on how to achieve this careful balance; rather, she simply notes that it produces fairly well-behaved children who thrive within the structure provided to them.  What I really liked about this book was that Druckerman is a real parent; that is, she, like many parents, doubts herself and points out her failures (but she isn't too hard on herself or self-depreciating).  Reading her observations, the reader gets the impression that she is learning as much as the reader as she goes along.  Finally, I appreciated that all of her observations are precluded by caveats (not ALL French children behave a certain way much like not ALL American children behave a certain way).  Overall, this was an enjoyable, take the advice/leave the advice read.
0307946711|4.0|I was all prepared to gush about this book. How it's not like the other books; not Nicholas Sparks or Jodi Picoult or any of that nonsense. It's a great idea, and a great story, with a great writing style. Dexter and Emma become friends on the day after their college graduation, July 15, 1988, and they have strong romantic feelings for each other, but the situation isn't right for them to get together. (As is so often true in life). But, they manage to stay friends. Through years and years and jobs and emotions and relationships and breakups and gains and losses. It's not easy, and they are both far from perfect, and they fail (a lot), but they manage. And that's the most beautiful thing I can think of. Dex and Em, Em and Dex. Best friends, estranged friends, bickering acquaintances, completely in love but never talk about it because the situation isn't right. I won't lie and tell you it hasn't made me want to call my own \\"Dexter\\", and tell him I forgive him for not calling me on my birthday two years ago, and I'm sorry I told him to f*** off the last time he drunk-dialed me. Because neither of us is perfect, but if someone wrote a book about one day of my life every year, I'd want him to be in some of them.<br /><br />The format of the book is magical. There's one chapter per year, the events of July 15, every year. And nothing in between. The story moves a long at a faster pace that way, because you're eager to find out not just what happens that day, but also what has happened in the past 364 days. Sometimes the chapters end with a little teaser, since the reader will never directly know what happens the very next day. But the answer is easily deduced from the next year's chapter. It even has repetition (which I love when done correctly) to emphasize the ways in which their lives are the same for multiple years, and the ways in which they come full circle.<br /><br />And then I got to page 348, at which point the book became complete crap. And stayed complete crap through the end. Why can't authors understand that a book doesn't have to end in both romance and horrible, shocking tragedy? The contrived scenarios are unrealistic, and if I'm going to read a story that is unrealistic why would I read one that doesn't make me happy? (And doesn't have dragons in it?) Life, love, relationships, and friendships almost always, like the world, end not with a bang but with a whimper. This novel had the potential to reflect that, but fell short.<br /><br />This is a book about growing-up, and the difficulties of friendship, and the difficulties of ordinary life (not contrived tragic life) in general. I recommend it to anyone who wishes that The \\"Unbearable Lightness of Being\\" didn't suck so bad.<br /><br />But for the love of all that is holy, STOP READING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE 347.<br /><br />Please email me if you would like my address to send me your copy of the book, so I can glue pages 348-435 together and return it to you.<br /><br />I'm not joking.<br /><br />The End.

B007L96SI6|5.0|Hands down, my favorite idols of all time are Kelly Clarkson and Adam Lambert and after hearing this album Haley is now the third added to my list.<br /><br />Haley Reinhart went from one of my least favorite idols last year to one of my all-time favorite American Idols all in the span of one season.<br /><br />I was initially worried about her chances for a record deal since she started off very shaky but fought for her life and clawed her way to third as one of the only shining lights in one of my least favorite seasons of idol ever. I still think she was robbed!<br /><br />My worries were that her heavy handed growling on idol wouldn't really make a listenable pop album.<br /><br />Either way, I've been looking forward to this album since I heard the ultra cute single Free and this is one of the best debut albums from an idol that I've ever heard. The songs are all varied but also work very well together in maintaining a cohesive jazzy, pop, 60s vibe, which is absolutely the perfect style for Haley.<br /><br />Almost all of the songs are upbeat and very summer-y. The lyrics are also well-written and seem thought out for this kind of pop. Haley also keeps her sometimes annoying growling that she used on idol to a minimum, which may or may not be good depending on your perspective. Her voice has a very light, throwback style that's perfect for the songs on the CD. The music style reminds me a little bit of Duffy (with a MUCH less annoying voice), Joss Stone and Adele mixed together (but less angry and more upbeat and catchy.)<br /><br />Overall, she sounds great and there isn't a bad song on the CD. I can honestly say I like every single song. Since I bought the album today, I've listened to it quite a few times already and my idol fan co-workers were digging it as well.<br /><br />Support the idols that can actually sing and purchase the album! If you're hesitating about buying this, let all the five star reviews convince you and go out there and get it. :-)
0399536108|5.0|I've been following Chris's blog for a while now and have always enjoyed his posts.  I purchased this book to get a more comprehensive idea of his philosophy and I got just that.  Some of the information I already knew and some were new ideas to me, this book is certainly not for someone who is established in their preferred life path, but is quite useful for those who'd like to start thinking outside of the box.  I recommend this to anyone who is considering veering from what we often accept to be a standard way of work and life.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|I met many of the Tuskegee airmen at an air show in Columbus, Ohio several years ago. (\\"Mustangs and Legends\\") True American heroes and key men in the advancement of civil rights! I enjoyed the movie and found it to better than I had heard. One major negative- the left wing George Lucas took his racist shots at the brave American white pilots. What a \\"surprise\\", George. They deserve better- Lucas should be ashamed. Otherwise, the movie does portray the struggles and the bravery of the Tuskegee airmen. It's a story that needs to be told, and one that shouldn't be forgotten.
1400069181|4.0|An interesting read, although will not teach you much about HOW to start something that matters.  Blake  encountered a series of happy accidents, which allowed him to build a great company.  Unfortunately, these accidents cannot be taught or planned for.  They just happened and he, being an entrepreneur at heart, knew what to do with them.  Quick and easy read, enjoyable and inspiring, but certainly not useful for someone looking for business advice.  I recommend it to anyone interested in others' stories of inspiring success!

B004X80QNG|4.0|Informant is an all in one app for productivity power users. It attempts to combine a calendar and to-do list into a streamlined format. However, as I will explain in a moment, it only partially delivers.<br /><br />Pro: This app seems designed specifically with Toodledo users in mind. It logs into the service with barely an issue and syncs with all of your folders, contexts, whatever with relative ease. Make a ToDo item, bam! It's on your Toodledo service as soon as you hit sync. Contexts, notes, due dates, everything pops up on the webapp almost instantaneously. I found that Toodledo by itself is alright, but add in Informant and I just can't live without it!<br /><br />Con: The easiest way to say this, is everything but Toodledo syncing. The app connects with your Google services to integrate Tasks and Calendar, which is a nice touch. But, unfortunately, it does this so poorly that it is not worth even setting up. The calendar service is slow especially compared to the stock calendar. Google Task integration is almost non-existent. In fact, every time I attempted to sync with Google Tasks completely screwed up my lists. Basically, don't try it!<br /><br />Most Useful Features:  As mentioned above, Toodledo syncing. Toodledo is one of those services that requires a mobile device to access, just so that your ToDo list is available whenever you need it. Informant makes this possible. Also, when creating a task, I especially like the alarm feature of the app. The app will set up a gentle reminder using your phone/tablet alarm system for any task you want. Very nice!
B002JODPSO|5.0|I've seen all the Die Hard movies and Live Free or Die Hard is one of the best (except for the stupid title). John Smith is back at it again with his comical remarks, tough guy attitude, and big kills. I really liked the villain and sidekicks in this movie too...far better than Samuel L. Jackson and \\"Simon.\\" Turn the speakers up, sit back with some popcorn, and and watch what an action movie should be like.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were a great read that captivated you from the first chapter to the last.  I'm hoping the authori decides to write a follow up!

B007YOC4RW|5.0|I'm a huge Joe B fan and like almost anything he does.  I was excited when I heard that he was releasing this album.  When the samples showed up on Amazon, I ran thru them all and was decidedly disappointed.  Not sure why I felt that way, but today when I could buy the MP3's, I did so, strictly on his rep.<br />WOW!  Played entire songs thru my Sennheiser HD598s and was wildly thrilled with the driving music that I could now clearly hear.<br />Really simple advice, if you even kinda like Joe B., BUY THIS ALBUM.  I think some of the songs could be huge popular crossover hits.  But what do I know?  I'm just a 63YO grandpa who has loved almost any kind of music all my life with favs in rock/blues.
0142405809|5.0|This is one of my go to books to give as a gift for a birthday or holiday. it is so cute and has gotten us into some other of the author's books.
B005LAIGN2|4.0|The story of these men is very moving... they fight for a country that treats them like dirt.<br /><br />As others have said, This story was told in \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" not that long ago; but maybe some people need regular reminders.<br /><br />I'm of Irish/German ancestry, and being white, hear a lot of trash from people who don't think that they're racists.<br /><br />Keep reminding us.<br /><br />Another movie especially worth watching is \\"The Miracle at St. Anna's\\".<br /><br />In any case, I thank these men; and all American warriors.  My continued freedom is thanks to you.
B0084YC5UC|3.0|Often the problem with Mad Men is that the writers seem to have come to hate nearly all of the characters. Betty used to be the emotional punching bag for the show. But more recently, \\"Betty hate\\" has pushed into almost every character. Its Lane's turn this week. Right turn clyde and Suddenly Lane is an entirely different character with all sorts of new things happening with no development. And all realism goes out the window as well. Whoever came up with this didn't understand much about how a business works.<br /><br />Its also Joan's turn. She is now as bad as Peggy. All whining and self-pity. Her husband is in the military which by the logic of the show makes him an inexplicable monster. We get more confirmation of his monsterousness which serves as a good lead-in for Joan's collapse into self-pity.<br /><br />They are gradually bleeding everything interesting out of Megan. The show tells us that she is a deadbeat over lunches one week. Next she insults another actor going for a role. And now we are down to domestic tantrums at the dinner table. No small irony that Mad Men in the latest season has been degenerating into the sort of melodramatic soap opera Megan complained about in a recent episode. Everyone is out of control. Everyone is whiny and bitter. They are on their way to ruining every character in the show.<br /><br />They put all kinds of poorly done throwaway cultural references in the episode. None of which seem to have been researched very well. We get Hari Krishnas, Star Trek and and Jaguars. The Hari Krishna stuff is probably three years too soon even if they had tried to get the details right. The Star Trek stuff is about one or two years early considering that it had only been on the air a couple months before the timing of the episode. Its the little details by which the writers tell the audience \\"we don't care\\".

0345803485|2.0|Do not waste your time reading this book.  It has no plot whatsoever, it is extremely repetitive and the sex is so unrealistic given the circumstances that it is just funny at times.  The writting is just so below average I just dont understand what is the big fuzz about this book.  Do not plan to continue reading the other two books.  Sorry!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|could not put this one down just had to read it all the way through can not wait for the next book in this series to get here fast enough
0345803485|5.0|So, first and foremost, if we leave out the naught tid-bits I actually found parts of the book humerous, cute and fun. I've heard it compared to a R-rated Twilight...but I love Twilight and that is also a guilty little pleasure of mine. It's fun fantasy, plain and simple. It's imagination gone wild and romantic and obviously a lot of women dream of a character such as Christian Grey or we wouldn't all be eating it up. I read all 3 books and enjoyed them immensly, but of course it's fiction so I read it as a fiction novel, not as an autobiography of a virgin college girl who winds up with a wealthy unstable fetish freak. The books make me smile, and what women wouldn't want that kind of attention? I blush with Ana...oh if only. So, for those who are seeking something other than fantasies and sexual situations that will make your jaw drop, do yourself a favor, read something else. I loved it and have recommended it to my reading group...that will make for a delicious meeting at book club. :)
0345803493|2.0|I thought the first book was interesting and very different, and thought I'd give book #2 a shot.  I was really disappointed.  I found that the book really lacked a strong plot.  It just seemed like a bunch of contrived reasons for the main characters to constantly reaffirm their feelings for one another and then have sex.  It gets a little old without an actual story to back it up to keep things moving.
8866130109|4.0|The only problem I had with this edition was that there was a small lego block affixed to the cover. I tried to remove it but then thought against it lest I damage the beautiful hardcover. The rest of the quality is like usual. I liked the decorative stickers as well.

B007EJ6S92|5.0|EPIC!  There are many moments on this album where you're going to stop and think \\"this is the best album EVER!\\"  I even think the track \\"A Greater Darkness\\" is the best song I've ever HEARD.  Moonspell is a top-notch, grade A band, and I'm still blown away.  Check out their new videos on YouTube if you need any further convincing.  This is definitely the album to own of 2012.
B002G1K82Q|2.0|The Beatles, the Vietnam war, star crossed lovers and show-woman Julie Taymor.  That is what `Across the Universe' brings to the table.  It doesn't always work and yet it is never less than intriguing.<br /><br />Using Beatles songs as jump off narratives for plot shifts, Taymor wraps her `Shakespearian' tale around a poor artist from Liverpool who travels to America and falls in love with a girl out of his league and mourning the loss of her beloved (who died in the war).  Together they make an odd pair, born more out of division than unity (their style, taste and political aspirations all stem from separate places) and yet the stars have aligned and shown them the light.  Musically, it doesn't always work.  It seems a little too all over the place and other than Sturgess and the dynamic Dana Fuchs, the vocals don't always deliver the goods.<br /><br />That said, it is a lovely looking film (the art direction is stunning and those costumes are spot on) and it has a central flow that keeps one glued, but it doesn't always make it's point quite how it wants to, and the interwoven storylines (especially concerning Prudence and Sadie) don't add anything to the film...in fact they tend to take away.  Taymor has an issue with overthinking her productions.  She creates truly grandiose looking vehicles (you can add this in with `Titus' as one of the prettiest feature films in recent memory) and yet they are hollow, forgettable almost.  She hasn't figured out how to incorporate her obvious talent for window-dressing into a film that has substance.  Oh, and the special effects here are somewhat atrocious.  She tries to tamper with Baz's insane editing and fast paced musicality with one of the earlier numbers and it comes across messy and childish.<br /><br />It had promise, but overall `Across the Universe' falls flat.

1451627289|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read from Stephen King in a long time. His books had become boring, as if they had been spat out by a computer. But not 11/22/63. The nostalgia was wonderful and the plot intriguing. I literally could not put it down, stayed up until 3am to finish it, and suffered a sore shoulder, elbow, and wrist because the book is so heavy. So I bought a Kindle Fire (and I love it) so that won't happen again.

0307352145|5.0|The extensive research behind this book brings out some interesting points. American society is generally more extroverted than Asian countries, and our preference for the gregarious person over the serious thinker has spilled over into our school classrooms. The typical classroom with its emphasis on \\"group learning\\" and extensive class participation is not a friendly place for an introverted child. This is particularly disturbing when you consider that the tendency for introversion has a definite genetic basis, and attempts to train children to fit in may be extremely stressful to them. There is no specific advice here, simply a wake-up call for parents; monitor the school environment to be sure appropriate learning and socialization strategies are applied to your children.<br /><br />The chapter on Cain's experience at a cultish Tony Robbins pep rally is worth the price of this book. The emphasis on schmoozing and positive thinking in overwhelmingly extroverted Harvard Business School students and in the business world is a symptom of a serious systemic defect in our society. Some victims of this mentality are unemployed people who are sold expensive Robbins-style classes in hopes of landing a job by projecting confidence. (Barbara Ehrenreich develops this theme in her book \\"Bright-Sided: How positive thinking is undermining America\\".) The \\"team building\\" fad in the workplace has not resulted in more productive employees.<br /><br />Corporations typically overlook their quiet talented employees for upper management positions in favor of aggressive self-promoters, with unfortunate results. Some of the research findings are truly shocking, and Cain has missed an opportunity to develop them further. For example, it has been shown that extraverts take more risks than introverts. Combine that with the fact that 20% of the top three executives at Fortune 500 companies are Harvard Business School graduates, and we can see this as a factor in the 2008 financial crash. Extreme risk taking was a major cause, yet these are some of the same executives who amassed multimillion dollar increases in compensation since the economy tanked.  Is there a correlation between identified corporate looters and whether  they are predominantly extraverts, or not?

B006AX6ONI|4.0|Mark Cuban is a fascinating man and his book is surprisingly simple. He offers very practical advice and tells personal stories including the losers.<br /><br />The cons are that this is a series of blog posts so there is no connection between previous chapters or building story line. The themes of mastering a craft, working hard and getting up when you get knocked down come through but this is certainly not a novel.

B0071LLHGC|5.0|Better than the Fillmore East Live album in my opinion and that album is pretty darn good. The recording is excellent on this album and Betts and Allman's guitars are very distinctive and clear. Duane Allman has never played better and Greg Allman's vocals were clear and strong. Truly a great album.
0439023521|4.0|Hunger Games Review<br /><br />After the reading the first installment of the hunger games, I find myself having an insatiable appetite for more.<br />An absolutely wonderful read, the first installment in the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins follows two protagonists, a girl named Katniss, and a boy named Peeta on a remarkable journey. Set in a futuristic world where the North America as we know it no longer exists, Katniss and Peeta are chosen from their impoverished district, district twelve, to compete in the Panem (name of the new country) \\"Hunger Games\\". These games pit the two against not only each other, but 21 other participants from the other districts in Panem (12 total).<br /><br />What Collins does well is establishing the bond between Katniss, Peeta, and their hometown of district 12. The book is a whirlwind of action and revelation. As both protagonists learn more of their abilities and potential in the hunger games, they also begin to reveal more about themselves to each other. A special relationship forms between Peeta and Katniss that plays a pivotal throughout the hunger games, at times pitting them against each other, while other times, making each other their only hope for survival.<br /><br />The Hunger Games takes a daring twist halfway through the book, and to share it would only ruin it for you, but rest assured it will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole book. Collins truly has mastered the craft of keeping the reader guessing, and flipping the pages wanting more. The story is a very simple one of survival and spirit, but the characters and scenarios that arise give it a unique and memorable touch. The Hunger Games is a book that leaves you hungry for more, and thankfully there are two more installments in the trilogy to enjoy.<br /><br />Regardless of what kind of book you like to read, the hunger games has a story and message universal to all. It will keep you flipping the pages until your eyes threaten to shut down, andeven then you will them to stay open just a little longer. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody, and plan on picking up a copy of the sequel very soon. So happy reading! And may the odds be ever in your favor.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book. Stephen Greenblat is a recognized historical scholar who knows how to make his subject exciting. You will be amazed at the story of Poggio, the secretary to popes who discovers the manuscript that turns the world upside down. The manuscript is a copy of a 200 page poem by Lucretius that was critical in forming the world views of Galileo and Freud, Darwin and Einstein; and had a revolutionary influence on writers such as Montaigne and Shakespeare and even Thomas Jefferson. It isn't too great a leap to thank Lucretius and Poggio for the Renaissance. It's a real page turner.

B007L96VCY|5.0|RAM is the classic McCartney solo album--a masterpiece. An explosion of durable musical ideas. He probably would have continued in this direction if the bone-headed rock critics of the time didn't scare him off. It's great to have the extra cuts that have been tagged on--but if the remaster is meant to celebrate RAM, why not include demos? Is McCartney saving them for some future acoustic release?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun... I love playing it even though I fail a a lot ofthem.... I'm trying my hardest to win but I&quot;m only doing this review for the points lol
B004LWZW9C|3.0|This movie felt a little too manufactured - whomever thought it up seemed to be reaching for every demographic, and just kept throwing in new storylines to try and grab everyone. Like it's precursor [[ASIN:B003HFKAM8 Valentine's Day]], it consists of several intersecting storylines, but this time centered in New York on New Year's Eve. It has an all-star cast - Halle Berry, Robert De Niro, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Katherine Heigl, Ashton Kutcher, Seth Meyers, Lea Michele, Sarah Jessica Parker, Michelle Pfeiffer, Hilary Swank, Sofia Vergara. The problem is, with so many stars and storylines, no one can dig in. The result is disjointed, with just a few nice moments. For me it was OK, a solid 3- stars, but if my husband was writing this it would clearly be a 1. So, if you are really in the mood for a romantic comedy, give this a try, but set your expectations accordingly.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kindle is constantly full of games that my 6 yr old is downloading so she can keep herself busy when idle, i.e. waiting room of doctors office etc... but games tend to get too complicated or not enough leaving u tapping a button every so often like a Sim game. This game she can actually play to try and get a better score than her previous and is also not to complex but still plenty fun and there are plenty of mini games so wen she gets bored with one she can switch to another with out having to download another game and fill my kindle further.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought the kindle Fire and the case for my nine year old son with disabilities. He is a bit of a clutz so I was concerned about him dropping and breaking the kindle. He has dropped it about 4 or 5 times and the kindle has had no damage thanks to the case. He is able to easily use the stand feature so he can watch a movie without holding it. It does its job, but there isn't much to it which is why I see it as being overpriced. Other than that, I like what I bought.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I do not like this youtube app. so if I do not like it you shod to.this is not a good app a bit!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Have had this for 3 months and it works great.  Fit perfectly and works great.  No batteries and the mouse operates exactly the same.  At night I just leave on my charger which is on my desk.  Read negative reviews.  I have had no issues.  When I quit using my mouse I set on charger pad was it's the perfect holder.[[ASIN:B004GCPJDQ Mobee Technology Magic Charger - Inductive Charger for Apple Magic Mouse (MO2212)]]<br /><br />Quit working after I wrote the review.  Service from company was non-existent.  Tried to contact company and finally gave up.  It's worthless to me when it doesn't work and they don't stand behind their product.<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004GCPJDQ/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B004O3YGMC|4.0|App is good. Which mouse control was better. Also could not get scolling to work. App changes my screen resolution on my PC because it says computer is running to slow. But the app does a good job of accessing your PC remotely.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Yikes.  There are SO many problems with 50 Shades of Grey.<br /><br />Even if you can get past the ridiculous names of the main characters, you might be concerned with their nonexistent character development, inconsistency, and complete lack of likability.  Anastasia Steele (seriously), apparently has multiple personality disorder.  She constantly confers with her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious,\\" the former of which seems to be a nymphomaniacal gymnast and the latter of which spends all of her time reading 19th century British novels and scowling in some forsaken corner of Ana's brain.  The author lets us know that Ana is \\"smart\\" and \\"witty,\\" but nothing Ana says or does confirms this.  In fact, whenever she mentions Austen, Bronte, or Hardy she muddles the references horribly.<br /><br />The novel is entirely written in the 1st person present (from Ana's perspective) which comes across as embarrassingly juvenile.  Ana's inner dialogue is baffling at best, and mostly borders on ridiculous.  The author seems to have forgotten that her main character is a 21-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN, who would NEVER take a \\"smart rucksack on holiday\\" and apparently doesn't have an email address (even though she just graduated college..and this book is set in 2011).  The prose is boring, stilted, and repetitive, much like this sentence.  All I can say is..if this was supposed to emulate Stephenie Meyer's writing style, she succeeded.  Not surprisingly, writing aimed at teenagers translates poorly to erotic fiction.<br /><br />I get the feeling this is supposed to be a redemption/romance about how Ana \\"saves\\" the poor, abused \\"Fifty\\" (seriously, these names), but her thoughts come across like an after-school special and do a disservice to the complexity of what could have been an interesting character study.<br /><br />By the end of this book I wanted to violently murder Anastasia Steele, her \\"inner goddess,\\" and her \\"subconscious.\\" (That's a lie.  I wanted to murder them by page 8.)
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I've been trying for two days now, both from my Android phone and online, to enter my cell number or email address just so I can download the stupid app store app. I click \\"go\\" and nothing happens. No matter what. You just lost my business, I'm sure not going to buy apps when you can't even make the app store download happen.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Got this as a birthday present for my 3-year-old niece. Apparently it was a hit.  My sister-in-law texted that bathtime lasted a full hour that first night.  She wouldn't even stop playing when the water got cold.  They had to refill the hot water.  Sounds like a winner to me!
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I'm very pleased with the vendor and the quality of the sunglasses.  They send/delivered the product when they promised.  The only glitch I had is that I bought the 55mm size and my wife is 52mm.  But apart from that, very satisfied with the product, delivery, and prize.  Thanks!
B007NUQJGO|1.0|hello, i have just about everything that santana has ever done, and i have to tell you this is without a doubt the WORST album he has ever done!!!!!
B0081KTI0E|4.0|Started out kinda slow and confusing, there were some flashbacks that left me wondering where the heck did that come from? Well that doesn't really make any sense. Part way into the movie I went back and started from the beginning to see if I might have missed something important. I hadn't, so I continued to watch hoping it would pick up.  As the movie progressed the story did unfold and started to come together. I won't give away any spoilers or storylines, needless to say although it wasn't action packed or thrilling it did manage to scare the hell out of me more than a few times. I was pleasantly surprised with Daniel Radcliff's (Harry Potter) acting in this role, he did a supurb job.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I started playing this game because I was bored but it has become addicting for me Lol. My only negative is not having neighbors but besides that its a overall fun game
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Thanks to, Tori Thomas whom had given out the hint to those of us that couldn't figure out why the phone kept closing out every time we tried dialing! I really had enjoyed what I had seen so far in this game, therefore, I wasn't about to give up on it so easily as so many others had done. So,I turned to the reviews, hoping that someone had been kind enough to reveal the secret to dialing that blasted phone! lol I may have eventually figured it out on my own but, my patience was quickly running thin!<br /><br />For those of you that are still struggling with this same issue: You only need to dial the LAST 5 digits! =)<br /><br />*Helpful Tip*<br />By searching Google or YouTube, oftentimes you can find Help videos or a Game Forum with a Q & A thread that will discuss many of these Hidden Object games. Oftentimes, focusing on the very same areas where many of us all seem to get hung up on! I've been able to find a way through a couple of games this way when I've become desperate. This a fairly new game so, I don't know how much one will find as of yet, but never know until you try! I'm gonna start searching myself if I can't figure out the combination to the padlock soon! lol Hopefully, I'll be able to figure it out soon. It's probably something quite simple, too! Simply maddening! Ahhh!<br /><br />I'm giving this app only 4 out of 5 stars because after I was pestered 12 times to rate the game...which I have gladly done, I'm STILL receiving the nag screen every 10 minutes or so! Most irritating to say the least! Stop the nagging & the app will be a perfect 5 stars!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's hard to write a review of this book.  On one hand it captured my attention completely and I couldn't put it down for more than an hour, finishing it over a weekend.  I found the storey between the two main characters very compelling.  I was caught up in the whole will she give in to him, how far will she go, will he be able to give her more, why is he the way he is ....  I kept reading and reading to find out the answers to these questions.  And I have just ordered the second book to continue that journey.  So in the character development and storey line this book is a winner.<br /><br />On the other hand, I have to admit that it was the erotica tag that first drew me to this book.  I haven't read erotic fiction before so I was drawn in by the promise of that and, quite frankly, was left rather disappointed on that front.  Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe I'm just to jaded in that department but I really don't consider this erotica. I've read some romance novels that are almost as descriptive.<br /><br />So I guess my end comment is that the storey between the two main characters is hot, the erotic writing is not.
0143119680|5.0|I needed to write this review for the fact that in my opinion, it deserves a 5-star rating. This has been the first story, in quite awhile, that's gripped at my heart and touched my soul. I understand that not everyone will agree, but with my love for history and the supernatural I thought Ms. Harkness did a superbub job in mixing the two. The storyline is not your typical supernatural romance or drama and a lot of the plausible facts she outlines really bring the exsistance of witch, vampire, daemons, and humans into question. One might have a hard time disagreeing the exsistance after reading this story. Ms. Harkness brings just the right amount of fact mixed in with fantasy to make you question it. I love it.<br /><br />She wrote it well and I love the other concepts of witch and wizardry she brings forth in this novel i.e. describing magic versus witchcraft. I appreciate the fact that she describes the differences between them perfectly, and demonstrates it.<br /><br />Excellent story, excellent adventure. I can hardly wait for Shadow of Night.
B007R41E8O|1.0|continuous downloading never got to play would like a refund<br />I warn everyone not purchase this game first it says 4mb but starts loading 350 then says verifying of 350 Mg then loads 500mb then verifies _500mg of downloading then verifies then downloaded 600mg
0345803507|5.0|Yes, the best story I have read in 2012!  The story made me laugh,cry,shout in rage,and shout in joy!  When a story can do that...it rates 10 stars!  That E.L. James was able to take a \\"taboo\\" subject and weave it into such a wonderful story----it is nothing short of amazing!<br /><br />A must read!
B000FC1KGG|5.0|This book was wonderful! It was beautiully written, and it had me in it's spell from the first page. It is full of hope and wonder.
0345803507|3.0|Point well made.  If I ever have to read that again, I may rip the page out.  This is the third book in the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy, which I'm assuming refers to Mr. Grey's fifty different personalities.  Like my other reviews in this series, I'll summarize for simplicity:<br /><br />I am Anastasia.  I have known this man for 2 months now, he is my first boyfriend ever, but I just know we'll be together forever.  He's also inexplanably great in the sack, like I have anything to compare it to...but moving on.  I will wear my purple plum dress, because one time, he told me he liked it on me.  I can't remember to take any sort of birth control, not even every 3 months, what this says about my intelligence level, I don't want to know.  Mr. Grey is controlling and I have to have permission from him to do anything.  If I do something without his permission, I get in trouble like a bad little girl, I want to live the rest of my life like this!  Oh no, this story is getting boring, better add some plot in.  Some bad guy is out to ruin our perfect romance, but the plot will drag on and on and on because really, we're too busy having sex.  Now our family is perfect, Mr. Grey is completely healed and we'll live happily ever after, at least until Mr. Grey cracks again.  The End.<br /><br />Ok, this book, the incessant sex really got on my nerves.  I started skipping those parts just to get back to the plot, not that the plot was especially interesting or surprising (I guessed the basics of any plot back in book 2).  The writing is very repetitive and got on my nerves.  I gave it three stars, like the others, because it IS hard to not finish, just to find out what happens to these ridiculous characters.  Alas, the answer is, nothing much.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Well, not literally, but it feels that way. It's a very minimalistic story, but what drives the movie is the intense atmosphere and emotions you get from the characters. Everyone here plays the parts flawlessly. From Gosling's seemingly stoic performance as The Driver, to Perlman's role as Nino. If this movie had any flaws to me, it would be that it feels so short. I just get lost in it every time I watch and find myself surprised that it's actually over. I loved it. But I can also see why some people wouldn't. It doesn't have a lot of dialog, the violent scenes come out of almost nowhere, and most people seem to want a fleshed out story for the most part. If you're going to watch this movie, understand that it is more like watching a piece of art. I have no doubt that in a few years, the movie will reach 'Cult' status among the likes of Fight Club and Donnie Darko.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'll admit, I was hesitant to get this book because the plot didn't really sound like it was my kind of read despite it's excellent reviews.  While browsing for something new to read I decided to give this book a try.  I'm still not sure this is my kind of genre, but the writing was excellent and the plot really just sucks you in and holds you tight.  By a couple chapters in I was hopelessly hooked and just couldn't put the book down....needless to say, I got very little sleep for a few days because not only could I not put down the first book I just had to read the other 2 right away as well which resulted in every second of my spare time for several days being devoted to reading. If you are at all like me and get sucked so deep into the plot of a good book that you can barely function until you've finished, make sure you don't start until you don't have anything going on for a few days because if you're not reading it, you'll be thinking about it, and you'll probably sacrifice some sleep to find out what happens next.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Nice to see the actors/actresses breaking away from the spell of typecasting. This is a great scary movie, and a wonderful story line. The graphics are amazing, and the general sense of creepiness and uneasiness of the entire movie is all over the place, and is an amazing and enjoyable movie to watch, considering the stuff that has been coming out in the last 10yrs or so. Its an original story, done by a good screenwriter, done by a great director, and has some amazingly great acting in it. I am amazed at how good Daniel Radcliffe is, and wish all the Harry Potter actors/actresses all the best of luck in the years to come.
B004I744AS|1.0|Ah, the pure, unadulterated study of words..... and your horoscope, too! Yes, I'm being facetious. Who splits up a science class with a bible study? I'm guessing that the horoscope industry has a vested interest in this app since I can't remove it using the customization option. Other than that wart that I have to look at, it seems okay.
1609613937|5.0|I had been eagerly looking forward to read John McDougall's Starch Solution. Not only am I delighted about the contents of this book and the important message it conveys but also the production is impeccable. McDougall's writing is so captivating and makes so much sense that it would be almost impossible for the reader not to want to apply this knowledge at once.<br /><br />44 years of \\"hands-on\\" medical experience packaged into a 200 page educational resource everyone can understand.(plus 150 pages of practical recipes to make healthful living even easier) A total must-read for medical students and health practitioners. THIS is the missing piece of education you've been looking for.<br /><br />It's almost as if Dr McDougall wants to do himself out of a job because once you read this book you probably never need see a doctor for any of the dreaded (and costly) \\"western\\" diseases so commonly assumed to be the inevitable course of ageing in our affluent societies.<br /><br />Old = sick? Not so, and there is plenty of proof included.<br /><br />In my opinion, Dr McDougall's book highlights the connections between food, health, lifestyle, and the \\"sickness economy\\" in the most accessible manner and belongs into absolutely every household.<br /><br />To first seek the truth and then to bring it to the public takes courage.<br /><br />Thomas A. Edison the great inventor said 100 years ago: \\"The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest her or his patients in the care of the human frame, in a proper diet, and in the cause and prevention of disease.\\"<br /><br />Well, the future has arrived. Dr McDougall, you have truly enriched my life with this book.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />D Frost (NZ)
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved the 1st book, The Girl with The Dragon Tatoo. Couldn't wait for book 2. I was not disappointed. Can't put it down. If you want books that take you away, read this series.
B004SDSSFY|3.0|I decided to buy the full version because I needed a way to create Excel spreadsheets on my Kindle Fire. Though it takes a short time to figure out how to do even basic tasks under the somewhat confusing navigation menu, I was able to complete several spreadsheets. My problem came when I reopened my document. The file would save my inputted information, but lose quite a bit of my formatting. Thankfully I don't need the application for anything work-related or I would have given it one-star.
B001E45XT4|4.0|It's cheap and better audio sound quality and better look. I am going to use with my PS3. It's not that bat as people give some bad review. I recommended this item
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I'm very pleasantly suprised at how good this album is.11 powerful songs that switch from anthemic post-punk defiance to pretty, mournful ballads.Then for a few bucks more (or the mp3 version for 10 bucks) you get 4 extra songs that almost stand like a bright and poppy ep of its own.<br /><br />Highlights for me include the title song-a dreamy landscape that is a thing of beauty.With powerful lyrics to musically empower outsiders (just like the great closing song \\"Beloved Freak\\").\\"Big Bright World\\" is classic Garbage-very melodic with a big buildup.\\"Sugar\\" is a smooth song i put on repeat a lot too.<br /><br />Not Your Kind Of People is a great edition to Garbage's catalog and is one of the best albums of the year.
B0076UXKDG|3.0|The grip feels good and solid and give the camera a nice feel but i still dont understand the reason behind the price. I think it is way too expensive
B0071QIN00|5.0|I really like Trial Extreme 2 Winter edition. It is very addictive and fun. It has had some glitches; like the mans motorcycle gets stuck; or his head goes through the wood. The levels start to get very hard though. But its still enjoyable! I think it is worth the money.
B00006AW2E|5.0|I was pretty apprehensive after reading some reviews on the sound quality, but I think it sounds great. Maybe not as good as some of the other Rolling Stones SACD's but definitely not as bad as some other reviewers have noted.
0525478817|5.0|Spoiler free!<br /><br />This book took my mind & threw it, and my entire self, into an emotional roller coaster.<br /><br />The day that I received it, I became so absorbed in the book after reading just two chapters, I couldn't resist the idea of reading more later on. When it came night, I picked it up again & then proceeded to stay up the entire night reading the whole thing for about a total of six hours. I smiled, I cried, and I felt the emotions of the characters. I wish I hadn't read it so fast because it was so good, but I plan to read it again soon.<br /><br />I recently rediscovered my love for reading & this was the first book that I picked up from my order. It was great & I highly recommend it if you just want to read a good book with a good story.<br /><br />Also, the 'Review' quotes sum it up perfectly, as well. I advise you to buy this book. Now.
0345803485|1.0|I'm having WAY more fun reading the horrible reviews!<br /><br />Now, I only read the first half, but that was too much for me. I'd love to buy this author a thesaurus. And a little creativity. The things the characters do is SO repetitive!<br /><br />she bites her lip<br />he runs his thumb along her lower lip<br />he tells her \\"Breathe\\"<br />he forces her to eat<br />she refuses to eat<br />his long fingers<br />she blushes/flushes<br />his crooked smile<br />she smirks<br />he smirks (someone's always smirking)<br />she peeks up through her lashes<br />she thinks 'oh my'<br />she argues with her 'inner goddess' (puh-leeze)<br />Holy Hell/Crap/Cow<br />she says 'Mr. Grey'<br />he says 'Ms Steele'<br /><br />Why does she always refer to him by his full name in her thoughts? That's kinda creepy.<br /><br />How could she possibly have lived to be a 21 college student and not have email?? Never had sex, never had an orgasm? Of course, now she has an orgasm at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />I could go on, but I won't.<br /><br />It's just terrible.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I was kind of suprized by the simplicity of the controls of this game. I'm use to having to make the character do every little thing but with touch screen control that gets difficult. So over all fun game with simple handling.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|very easy to order and download book instantly. Haven't started  reading it yet but collecting for summer beach reads this summer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought the Fifty Shades Trilogy was amazing. I wouldn't suggest them to readers under 18 years of age but to anyone above that, they are a must read! If you enjoy a story with drama, love (lots of love) and twists in every chapter, you will love these books. And I promise you won't be able to put them down.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have found the Mahjong Delux HD game I purchased to be very intertaining and I have enjoyed it very much.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|It is so good to hear music made by a real vocalist with lyrics, melodies, rhythm and sass. Too much of what passes for music these days is repetitive beats, repetition of a few words and near mind piercing electronic drivel. Adam was robbed of the title on American Idol by producers who have let Tweens mega vote and crowning bland WGWG (white guy with guitar) since Adam and whatshisface competed. I have waited to hear what Adam's creativity would deliver and the results so far are damn good.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Brittany is AMAZING!! She just has an unforgettable, soulful voice. I've enjoyed every single song on this album. Being an Alabamian myself, I'm proud of these guys (and gal)!!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I love the Pocahontas movie even though it's not realistic it still teaches children and adults a wonderful meaning. Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Whew!! I just finished reading this book and I am breathless. This book was wonderful! It contained the right amounts of emotion, romance and steamy steamy steamy parts. I literally blushed several times reading this book and that is hard to do! The steamy parts were what any woman would enjoy! Great characters and story line! I can't wait for the second book!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like it.  It's fun and challenging so far. I expect it will get harder as I reach the higher levels;but<br />I get bored if the game is too easy.
B002JVWR4A|3.0|My wife and I just realized we hadn't watched this season of Bones as we rewatch some of our favorite series. So even though the series is now into season 7 (on the air) and we have season six waiting to be watched, I've come to realize that the show has grown a bit \\"long in the tooth\\" and some of the plot contrivances are starting to wear thin enough to take this down into the mediocre. A lot of fans will disagree, but I've commented to my wife after watching more than one episode that the story was contrived. I've even noted a horrid plot ending where we were told the resolution to the case, rather than watching is play out. Brennan has suddenly lost her savvy in a number of areas and again repeats \\"I don't know what that means\\" far too many times, especially if previous seasons have already revealed her knowledge in a certain area. In addition, the series has dropped into the Star Trek: Next Generation syndrome of having meaningless (yes, nothing but empty words) techno-babble substitute for real forensics. It is as if we've spend almost five years and Brennan has no ability to learn new things. Her strident attitude toward the mundane has worn particularly thin and is now unconvincing, whereas in past seasons, the character demonstrated she could learn new things. Now, she digs in and defends where admission to the unexplainable would be more satisfying. (I've already watched a number of season six episodes as they aired on Hulu and found Brennan to have become even more strident in Season six.) For a series that had great chemistry and character interplay during the first four seasons, this one was a disappointment.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|For one poor woman, it's a day from hell! Just when she thinks she's found a way out, she's right back where she started!  I'm not gonna give too much info about this movie away, great film about friends getting stuck out on the ocean after their boat tips. They spot a ship and think their troubles are over. They could't be more wrong!<br />A must see for fans of The sixth sense, Shattered, and other sci-fi, horror films .
B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel Kahneman mentions in the introduction of the book that he seeks to increase the quality of conversations had at the watercooler (or something to this effect), and it absolutely has had that effect on me. I now am much more mindful of focusing illusions (people think the topic at hand is way more important than it actually is in relativity), how I react to statistics (percentages are much better for assessing true impacts while fractions are more for invoking emotion since people easily fall prey to denominator neglect), and making predictions from an outside view to an inside view (we often predict ourselves as coming much too close to the best case scenario, rather than looking at the average and then appropriately adjusting predictions based on the aspects of the case at hand).<br /><br />I find myself referencing and quoting this book, literally on a daily basis, and I think that anyone who reads it will draw a significant benefit from doing so.
0393064476|5.0|Greenblatt writes in a very lucid style, and doesn't spare the scholarship.  This book is an entertaining as well as an informative exposition of Lucretius' De Rerum Natura, and its place in the Renaissance.  The text is a good read, and notes and references provide lots of grist for the more proficient.  Another of Greenblatt's 'great books'.
0345803507|5.0|Wow!  Not usually my type of book, but I ordered the next two half way through this one.  loved it
0307266303|5.0|With over 1k reviews here, there is not that much that can, or needs to be, be said about this book. It is one of the few best-sellers that is not only as good as advertised but, in my opinion, has emerged as a modern-day classic.<br /><br />I have both the audio version and the hardcover and revisit both on a regular basis. McDougall is a talented writer and has put together a book that competes as a stand-alone novel or as individual chapters that can be read and reread by themselves.<br /><br />I am unable to think of a person who would not enjoy this book, runner or not.
0385738765|3.0|As the second book in the trilogy by James Dashner, this title was fast-paced and an easy read (something casual and light).  Some of the events seemed a little too convenient at times.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Love the serIes.  Keep them coming at reasonable rates. Great to watch them when ever and where ever I want.
0061122416|5.0|Obviously if you are looking for a thriller or a romance novel, this book is not for you. I have been astonished reading some of the user reviews of this book, reviews that ask questions along the lines of \\"what's the big deal?\\" The answer is that there IS no big deal... this book is simple, patient, and in many ways a reflection only of the person reading it. As such, it can, on the one hand, be nothing more than a story about a boy looking for something he saw in a dream. And while that story has charms of its own, it is not terribly unique or exciting. On the other hand, the deeper question being asked by the book is: What were you meant to do on this earth? And if you can discover the answer, there is a follow-up: Are you willing to try to actually DO it? If these questions seem irrelevant or self-indulgent to you, then you will probably not find the book interesting. But if such questions seem worth examining, then this book will come alive in your hands. You will read it again and again, and you will wish it were twice as long as it is.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|Well worth watching.  As usual, Meryl Streep did an excellent acting job as was recognized by the Academy Awards.  Some friends commented they expected more of the Prime Minister's on the job activities.  Not having these expectations, I thought the script was well done.
B007H9B6KA|4.0|Garbage is back.<br />But...ARE they back?<br />Obviously, this is their new album.<br />But...IS IT...?<br />Let's find out.<br /><br />Automatic Systematic Habit - First things first, you are Garbage. You blazed a trail in the 90's by, not so much creating the hot-female-fronted-dark-pop-rock-band-with-some-electronics-thrown-in-there, but certainly by perfecting it and carving a niche for yourselves in pop culture.<br />You are not Britney Spears or Madonna or some other crappy/bland product that needs autotune and nastee hott tekno beatz to get people's attention...as you've done with \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\".<br />You're better than that.<br />Now that we've agreed on that, we can focus on the fact that it is a very brave song. For this to be the first track on their first album in seven years is very courageous. It shows evolution of sound and concept and that is always exciting to see.<br />Just wish the song was better.<br /><br />Big Bright World - Ah, here we are. I'm beginning to understand why everyone who heard this album said it sounded like the first one: because it's great. This is the kind of track that made Garbage stand out, that grabbed the mainstream's attention. It's not dark and smoky and sexy like some of their other stuff, it's bright and open and hopeful, which is just as welcomed as the former. Love the sound of this. It would go perfectly with a fan made Doctor Who music video.<br /><br />Blood For Poppies - A bit radio-y for my taste; not bad, just a bit...soft, I suppose. There is some new ground tread on here which is always nice.<br /><br />Control - Harmonica is a bit weird... Something about it reminds me of the feel of Use Your Illusion II. Interesting, but not really great. Oh and that singing-into-a-fan vocal effect towards the end...yikes.<br /><br />Not Your Kind Of People - Starts off kind of weak. Remains weak. On the whole a pretty forgettable song. I thought this would be a lot more aggressive and confrontational basedon its title. But it's more sad and proud; a low energy anthem for outsiders. A lot of this album seems dedicated to said outsiders.<br /><br />Felt - This feels like a b-side. A really good b-side. Not bad at all, just a bit incomplete maybe. Love the guitar and chords. Shirley's...yodeling at the end is an odd choice...<br /><br />I Hate Love - Excellent, rock-solid 90's Garbage. Total call back to what made them great. I hope this is the next single. At times it has the feel of (another) Bond theme. And the ending? \\"And then your love dies\\"? Dark.<br /><br />Sugar - Really dig this one. Don't know if anything Shirley Manson does could ever be as sensual as \\"Supervixen\\", but this comes in a close second (or third if you count \\"#1 Crush\\"). Her sultry little husk is still intact after seven years of disuse. Or, to put all this into one word: rowr. Although, much like with Lykke Li, I have trouble believing that either of these talented, gorgeous, artistic women really has problems finding men to love them.<br /><br />Battle In Me - Very strong, very forceful track. I really enjoy the guitar/drum breakdown at the chorus. Not sure why this was the first UK single and America got the far less interesting \\"Blood For Poppies\\". Then again, all these record companies are reaching senility and making less sense, so...I guess that explains it? Either way: great song.<br /><br />Man On A Wire - Kind of sounds like Peaches. This brings up an interesting aspect of Garbage's music. More often than not, it isn't good Garbage songs versus bad Garbage songs, it's super catchy and well written radio playable Garbage songs versus skippable Garbage songs. I can't really think of an out and out bad Garbage song, just a bunch that I'd rather not listen to in favor of a different, better Garbage song. The delineation is clearest, I feel, on their second album Version 2.0. There are two types of songs on that album: the radio singles and those that are not radio singles. The former just have that perfect mix of hooks and melody and everything else that makes a song great and super replayable, and the latter just feels a bit...wrong. It isn't really something I can point out, just this abstract feeling of \\"these are better than those\\". All this to say: \\"Man On A Wire\\" is skippable. For me at least.<br /><br />Beloved Freak - A disclaimer: I'm a huge Eels fan, and, as the title reminds me of \\"Beautiful Freak\\", the two songs will always be compared in my mind and the Garbage song will always be found lacking. Sorry guys. Also, I don't really like the song a whole lot. It's too smaltzy and saccharine. \\"You're not alone, you're great, you're special, let your light shine...\\". It all just sounds like a grade school teacher consoling a kid that all the other kids are calling a weirdo because he like Magic cards instead of baseball cards or plays D&D or wears a cape or something. Honestly, I blame my own cynicism. It's a sweet, warm, encouraging song and my sensibilities just don't lie that way...even though I, too, own a cape.<br /><br />Overall, this album shows that Garbage is still capable of evolution. Maybe not lyrically so much, but sonically. Most of the music on this album has so much going on under the drums, bass, guitar and vocals that it makes listening with headphones and listening on speakers two very different experiences, both rich and highly enjoyable.<br />I'm very interested in hearing the other eleven or so songs the band wrote and recorded for the album, as they're known for having some really excellent b-sides out there, many of them better than some album cuts, in my opinion. I don't think I'll consider Not Your Kind Of People truly complete until the other half has been released and can be fit in and around this first half. In any case, Garbage is certainly back and, hopefully, able to step right back into where they were almost ten years ago.<br />Oh, and also, Butch Vig is awesome.

0061692042|5.0|Many years ago, ten or fifteen at least, people in high places were saying the next American writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature would be Richard Ford.  There is a lot of water under that bridge, but judging by Canada, Ford's in focus out of focus time travelling modern parable of American life, it could still happen.<br /><br />I don't know what Ford's connections are in the banking industry but his new novel has the look, feel and attitude of work that should be wrapped, shipped and Fed Ex delivered to Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan.  In this tale of a father wrapped up in illicit crime, he has not only constructed an engaging story, but made bankng the central metaphor of our time.  It starts moderately enough but by page 71, it's on you like a sledgehammer: \\"how do people act when they're about to jump in their car and drive off to rob a bank?\\"  You don't need  a shotgun, or a pistol.  You could very well rob a bank using a credit default swap.  In fact you could rob a country that way, he seems to say.<br /><br />So I don't buy the argument that Richard Ford is regressing into the past, cycling back to his work with Rock Springs.  Jamie Dimon's bank got robbed, what? Last week?  First we heard $2 billion, now the number is $5 billion and likely to go higher.  And what makes Canada all the more intriguing is Ford's method of alternating time and space - a new technique for him.  Rock Springs was constructed in the past and stayed there.  The Sportswriter and Independence Day glimmered on the surface of conteporary life.  Canada occupies both past and present, allowing Ford to make not so subtle allusions to the banking crisis that nearly took the country (the world?) down.<br /><br />In the novel, however, there is punishment and not all of it inflicted by the legal system.  In real life, there was no full accounting of damage.  This too gets its comeuppance with the deftness that has come to characterize Ford's work.  \\"Some people want to be bank presidents, some people want to rob banks\\", and are not too particular how they go about it., some people want to rob banks\\", and are not too particular how they go about it.

B007EC6FIS|3.0|The \\"classic Keane sound\\" is back.  While that is definitely good news, it comes with some baggage.<br /><br />For background purposes, I will say that I loved the first two Keane albums and loathed the second two.  This album, as others have already said, brings back the piano and gives us some catchy, snappy tunes similar to the first two albums.<br /><br />That being said, there is something lacking on this album- I think it lacks a certain depth.  A lot of the songs come across as generic and almost forced; there is a lot of good music here but not a lot of emotion.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"You Are Young.\\"  It's a nice little song, but carries the depth of the average television commercial.  \\"You've got time to realize / you're shielded by the hands of love / `cause you're young!\\"  Blah.<br /><br />\\"Disconnected\\" has my favorite \\"hook\\" of the album- it features a great chorus that's tough to get out of your head.  However, it starts with two weak verses that almost sound like it was written too low for Tom Chaplin's vocal range.  \\"Something's crept in under our door\\" - those are the opening lyrics that provide a bizarre visual to a song with more promise than what's delivered.<br /><br />\\"Silenced By the Night\\" and \\"Sovereign Light Café\\" come the closest to the emotion of the older Keane albums.  There are plenty other bright spots as well.<br /><br />I struggled between giving this album 3 or 4 stars; 3.5 sounds about right.  It's not fair to compare Strangeland to Hopes and Fears or Under the Iron Sea and to give it credit, Strangeland has its moments.  But there is no \\"Atlantic\\" on this album, a song that is heartbreakingly raw and emotionally charged.  There is a lot of pleasant-sounding music, but once you give it a few listens, the charm wears off.  It's good background music and compared to the last two albums, I'll happily take it.  But while I want to like this album more than I do, I know Keane is capable of more than this.  In the meantime, I'll take what I can get.
0345803485|3.0|Yes this book is top seller right now. But most of this book is just like the Twilight books except without vampires and with a sex addict instead. Ana is an exact mirror image of Bella. And Christian Grey is the over protective boyfriend and they have this \\"connection\\". Yes people may like the book but if you didn't like twilight this book is not for you. Plus it contains graphic details on their \\"relationship in bed\\".

B007NESBK2|5.0|Sade's new blu-ray concert video is exceptionally crystal-clear, great to watch and highly recommended.  Sade performs with style, grace, and elegance as always.  Her voice is even more beautiful and clear than ever -- and the band is tight; a great ensemble. Stuart's sax playing, esp. on Jezebel, is legendary...way to go!<br /><br />There's many new tracks in addition to familiar favorites like Paradise, No Ordinary Love and Smooth Operator; for example the new \\"Love is Found\\" song is upbeat, fun to watch. Thanks Sade for continuing to shine, to the band for musical brilliance, and to everyone for making this possible (clear audio and excellent visuals/dp/production/staging).  As a longtime fan since the 80s, it's great to see Sade continue to perform magnificently.  Very professional and well-produced.<br /><br />To the music,<br /><br />Ken<br /><br />7/2012 Update: Two months later, this is my most-played recent concert DVD... I'd watched Sade's earlier dvds dozens of times over the years; I've been watching this at least 1-2x/week since I got it, lots of replay value.  Really enjoying the high-impact production touches; like lightning flashes on No Ordinary Love, the staging on Smooth Operator a la film noire look, upbeat visual background scenery on Kiss of Life, circles/visuals in video background on Paradise. Perfect way to highlight Sade's most-beautiful vocal stylings.<br /><br />Sade's band redefines \\"tight\\", with smooth backup singers, and brilliant ensemble musicianship this one's a real treat to watch over and over again.  Thanks Sade for shining some light into these times.  As always you sparkle with clear, thoughtful vocals, wit, professionalism, talent and stylish worldclass musicianship. You 'bring it'; we all appreciate it.  Like a fine wine, you and the rest of the band just get better with time.  Thank you!  A+++  This one's a winner.<br /><br />9/2013 update: all this time later, I like this bluray dvd better than any other concert one I have, imho it's the best released in recent years.  I watch it over and over again, Sade and her band bring beautiful music better than anyone else. Tight, hip, fun, immensely musical; thanks so much to all of you for producing this treasure.  Best. Concert DVD. Ever.  This is very watchable/listenable, over and over again; I watch favorite tracks from this more than any other, in my considerable library.  Sade's the best.  Smooth, stylish, tight, and wonderfully brilliant.  Thanks a million, for adding so much.  Classy musicianship reinvented and kept more vibrant and alive than ever.  You're my favorite singer, and favorite band, of them all.  Unlike others, I never get tired of listening to Sade.  I still watch 'Love Is Found', 'Paradise', 'Your Love is King' and others every week, very enjoyable.<br /><br />12/2014: the professional sound, impact and visuals continue to make this my favorite concert dvd ever. In watching it so often one thing I like a lot is the variety of songs, from upbeat 'Paradise'/'Love is Found' to quiet, wistful 'Jezebel'. Astonishing range and versatility from the entire band, and world's best singing from Sade. Thanks!imho it's the best released in recent years.

0345803485|4.0|Like many other reviewers have stated here, the writing in this book series is very amature and was clearly poorly-edited (if edited at all.)  This first book is particularly hard to stomach - the attraction Ana feels toward Christian is difficult to understand and the relationship they develop with each other is not a very healthy one.  When I was reading this book I kept trying to project myself into the character's shoes but found her impossible to relate with; her tolarence for his \\"baggage\\" is saintly. When I finished this book I hesitated before picking up book two.  If the second and third volumes in the series were going to be more of the same, I really didn't want to keep reading.  However, the hype surrounding the series finally convinced me there just HAD to be more to this.  So I decided to keep reading and found myself devouring the books.  Did the writing get better? Unfortunately no.  But I will say the character development gets better as the series progesses.  I really can't pinpoint what exactly I loved about these books, maybe just the fantasy of it all?  Maybe the discussions this books has opened up between my friends and myself, my husband and myself? I'm not sure.<br /><br />In the end, if someone were to ask me what I though of this series I would say \\"The writing is terrible, the story is unbelievable, and I loved it.\\"

B007MAETA8|5.0|In his excellent DVD \\"Where the Light Is\\" filmed in 2007, John Mayer adamantly insists that those who think they know his music are mistaken. He suggests that a true artist should be a musical chameleon capable of changing the face he shows the world. Mayer also suggests that even he doesn't know what that true face may be. Nothing he has released since then contradicts that viewpoint. This superb record, which hones his artistry to bare essentials in both song writing and production, is merely the latest evidence of that. Sounding as if it might have been recorded in his basement, Born and Raised features the very essence of Mayer's artistry. The songs are melodic and memorable without being cloying. Mayer's lyrics are probing and insightful but never self indulgent. With a decidedly Country tinge that is nevertheless strangely timeless in its appeal, this is Mayer's least commercial and most accomplished CD to date. Songs like \\"Speak For Me\\" and \\"Born and Raised\\" sound as if they have always existed and that Mayer simply grasped them out of the air, put them in his guitar case and took them home. He has traveled a long way from his beginnings as a pop heart throb. Mayer's talents as guitarist, singer and song writer make him today's most versatile musician, each new release a snapshot of where he currently resides. This latest release showcases John Mayer living at home, just south of the crossroads where American music has its roots in both folk and the blues. Born and Raised is a strong release from a gifted artist.<br /><br />Mike Birman

B006Z21ZEM|3.0|I wasn't happy with the quality of the recording on this one. It sounded really muddy, and Dave's guitar parts tended to disappear in the mix at times. I know this is a danger with live recordings, but we've also heard most of these songs before (MANY times before). It's worth getting if you MUST have \\"When the Wild Wind Blows\\" live (which I did, so I got it), but you may be disappointed if you're looking for a crisp live recording.
1847879071|5.0|This was a FANTASTIC purchase!  Though I've had extensive statistical training throughout my Ph.D program, I feel like this book connected SO many dots for me.  It is clear and easy to read - simple real life and easy to understand examples.  The language is clear but isn't talking down to you.  I couldn't recommend this any further!  (And of course I just read the \\"outlier\\" example, so I had to make sure to add my own rating of 5 stars!)
B00753MBHA|4.0|It was really good to hear Accept back in old form. Some of the songs are weak, but the strong ones more than make up for it. Shadow Soldiers in particular is one of my favorites, along with Dresden and the title track. Accept was NEVER just Udo...it was at least in equal part the musical vision of Wolf Hoffman, and this album shows that he still has that vision and drive.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very good story with intriguing twists and turns.  I didn't really think that I would like it as much as I did, as this is not really my type of reading material.  I was very much surprised how it kept my interest and now I want to start book 2.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|I have always loved Rubinstein. I might even venture to say that, though he may not have produced the definitive recordings of all pieces within his repertoire, to my ears he never produced anything that sounded anything less than beautiful. Here is a man whose delight in the sound- and soul-world of music ripples forth in every arpeggio, whose identification with the message behind the music emerges from behind the dying into silence of every lingering fermata.<br /><br />There are individual discs here that are simply mind-blowing, from the early Chopin to the Beethoven concerti with Leinsdorf to the Mozart concerti with Wallenstein and Krips to the collaborations with Heifetz, Szeryng, Piatigorsky, and the Guarneri Quartet. Indeed, as much as I love the concerto works, Rubinstein brings something so inimitable to chamber music, some deep commitment to ensemble work that is all too often missing from the later generations of virtuosi.<br /><br />In short, let me accord this release my heartiest recommendation. It was worth every penny, and every hour of listening has been glorious. And I haven't even gotten to the DVDs yet!

0307352145|4.0|'Quiet' is a timely series of well-researched essays converted into a book.The footnotes lead to impressive reading material for anyone interested in a wide scope of areas associated introversion. Many of the comments and concerns raised by other readers will be easily answered by the footnotes at the end of the book. I am an INTJ and I can sense some of the challenges Susan seems to have faced in writing this book - There is tons of meta-analyses, followed by some prescriptive advise, followed by some anecdotes about famous introverts. The fundamental mental premise of this book is that the world needs to improve how it deals with introverts and deaddict itself from the culture of extraversion, a valid concern in the complex dynamic world we see today. The content is valuable; initial chapters successfully explain how the finer aspects of how to differentiate between introversion and some traits that unfairly get generalized/attributed to introverts.The problem is that the book tends to make a diffused case as it tackles multiple facets and lacks some editorial insight. With so much to say, the book falls into the trap of trying to make every case that it can and ends up with breadth and depth alternating unpredictably. It makes me wonder if the 'extroverts' of the world will be able to complete this book.
0439023521|4.0|The book carries the reader swiftly from the start to the end in a story that has a very personal feel within the framework of a very compelling adventure. It is told in the first person through the eyes of Katniss who gets embroiled in the Hunger Games, an event akin to the ancient Roman gladiator fights in the Coliseum. The arena even has the underground rooms and tunnels like the Coliseum. However, unlike ancient Rome the Hunger Games takes place in the framework of advanced technology with frequent technological surprises along the way. The story of Katniss's participation in the Games reveals the structure of an oppressive society where the aristocrats or oligarchs in the Capitol control those living in the 12 districts. Those in the Capitol hold all the wealth and power and privilege while those in the districts suffer in poverty and food shortages and oppression. Like a good adventure story there is plenty of action as well as a web of relationships and interpersonal stories. All these operate within the framework of a society that monitors and controls its citizens very closely. [[ASIN:B005DI4906 Selected-The Strange Story of Captain Jennings]]

The song Apocalyptic Thrill has this bad ass little hammer-on pull-off riff, You're a Lie has a this double picking riff about 0:57 into the song that sound like something John Petrucci would come up with, and there is a lot more kick ass music on here.Get this CD!!!

B007RRFUHM|5.0|Like a beautiful musical sprite from another planet, Kimbra casts a spell with Vows, her debut album that is both a wonder and treasured gift. It doesn't fit in the box of any musical genre. It cleverly covers a wide range of musical styles which is a testament to Kimbra's artistry. Here are my 5 favorite songs for now:<br /><br />\\"Something In The Way You Are\\" so perfectly expresses that curiosity you have that drives you to get to know someone better (or to psychotically obsess over someone). Whatever the case,<br /><br />\\"Cameo Lover\\"  is a fun flashback to the 60s, this sounds like a spirited hit that Phil Spector would have written.<br /><br />\\"Good Intent\\" has a air of suspense to it in terms of sound. And I love how the lyrics express that good intent don't always render the best results. How true!<br /><br />\\"Call Me\\" (from the deluxe version) - Growing up on a healthy diet of R&B/Funk, I naturally gravitated to this song instantly. No cryptic lyrics or deep emotional content here;  just a great head-bopper.<br /><br />\\"Sally I Can See You\\" - an ode to the eternal them of change. I love the chord progression throughout the song.<br /><br />Vows is a remarkable debut from an intelligent, gifted artist. What an all too rare and satisfying experience it is!
B0018RKELY|5.0|I can appreciate what Green Day did in their earlier career, but I have not been much of a fan of their newer music. Dookie and earlier were great albums (I refuse to call them 'punk'). Since then, they've lost me.<br /><br />This Foxboro Hot Tubs album, though, WOW! It is amazing. The best of the catchy Green Day hooks, but with more of a 60's garage band feel. I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />The vinyl pressing is nice. I had purchased the download off iTunes, and when I realized how start-to-finish awesome it was I ordered the vinyl. Packaging was fine, it came with a CD, which is nice, but somewhat worthless to me. I'd rather just get a download code with vinyl, even though I didn't need the download with this particular purchase.<br /><br />FanTAStic album. I really wish they'd put out another album and tour again as Foxboro Hottubs
B002KE47Z8|3.0|This is a book of collected stories written by Lahiri. Part One consists of 5 separate stories. Part Two titled, \\"Huma and Kaushik\\", is three stories. The first is by Huma, the second by Kaushik, and the third is a combination of the two once their lives reunite in Rome when they are adults.<br /><br />All stories have the common theme of immigration into the USA from the Bengal region in India. The Bengali parents move to the States and the children become Americanized. There is a conflict between the children wanting to follow American traditions and clothing, whereas the parents want to hang on to their traditions and socialize with other Bengali families. Once the children are grown, they marry with white Americans infusing the traditions of the two. Sometimes they work and sometimes not.<br /><br />The tone and style of all stories read the same so that they flow together. I never felt a difference from one story to the other. This book is an interesting look into the Bengali culture and the experience of immigration.
1416511946|5.0|Scary stories. Somewhat unbelievable to hear what was going on. I was in high school when this journal was written and I was blind to the level of abuse that was going on. I saw these guys as 4 guys who liked to drink and screw. I defended them up and down to my parents when they complained about what I was listening to.<br /><br />I guess they were right. It's unbelievable to me that Sixx lived through this. This is one of the deepest, darkest things I've ever read. And it's true.<br /><br />A great book, and an interesting layout with the graphics and photos throughout. It can be a bit difficult to read due to the layout and the content, but it's worth it.<br /><br />Also note that his photography is outstanding. Check out that book when you've finished this one.

0812550706|3.0|Marie's review is, I think, spot-on: [...]    I was also really turned off by the foreword in my edition, I find authors telling us how great their own works are to be really off-putting.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Mrs. Taylor's Senior Honors Literature class was assigned to read Jane Eyre. I truly enjoyed reading this book. The details were so good that I could imagine myself there in the action. Jane Eyre is a dynamic character. She is very strong willed. I would recommend this book to just about anyone.
0812992792|5.0|This is a brilliant gripping story.  The author has done an amazing amount of research and weaves a tale that I found hard to put down.  His dscriptive style carried you right into this dark oppressive country.  Some parts were very difficult to read but because I was so invested in the characers, I had to keep reading.<br /><br />It is also a very frightening book.  It is frightening that a country like this exists in the world and it is frightening to think that if some people have their way, our country may resemble this.  A place where no one is safe.  A place where everyone is suppose to be the same and everyone is interchangeable.  Only those at the highest levels of the society acknowledge any individual talent that may be unique to an individual.  Otherwise, if a person works hard enough they should be able to do anything.<br /><br />I had seen almost nothing about this book before I began to read it.  It just seemed to beckon to me from the shelf every time I went by.  It is not normally the type of book I would pick up from the description.  But I did not read the description, I just began to read it because it seemed to be calling me. then, I couldn't put it down, even in the parts that are very hard to read.<br /><br />It was very interesting to see the way propaganda could twist the description of the United States to take what we consider positive to turn it into something sinister or insulting.  It gave me even more respect for our Secreary of State who must deal with these types of things.<br /><br />I wish the book had been just a few pages longer.  We found out what happened to Sun Moon, Commander Buc, the Intrrogater and his family, and it was strongly hinted what happeed to our hero Jun Do.  I wish he had gone on to tell us what happened when everyone arrived for the events of the morning, ecause those characters were also fascinating and I became interested in their reactions and choices.<br /><br />This is a book I think everyone should read.

1400032717|3.0|I read this at the recommendation of a friend and am now left in an awkward position wherein I have to return the book underwhelmed.  She was so insistent that I read it, too.  Bummer.<br /><br />It's not that the book is bad.  It started off with an addictive momentum and when I was away from it, I found myself missing it.  I was enthusiastic about the read when it was in my hands because it was different and unpretentious.  Briefly, a dog is murdered and the crime needs solving.  The protagonist, Christopher, logs his investigation in a sharp, first-person narrative.  He reads as a troubled child, likely affected with something akin to Aspergers or a autism-like mental illness.  Emotionally void, he traverses the incident like a robot filling in dry spots in the narrative with math problems and notations about the manic mannerisms he uses to keep himself occupied and scream-free.  It was all interesting, occasionally sad, and I adhered to it willingly because the story is a mystery and there are some twists and turns initially that were making it worth my time.<br /><br />But then it flattened out and stayed that way through its ending.  I hate that I'm complaining about this because the story was realistically grounded and not at all too fantastic to believe, which is something I typically lean on.  But, man, I eventually became bored with the whole thing and found myself reading on autopilot while daydreaming about other things.  (This may sound ridiculous and irrational, but this is the sort of story that I would have gobbled up ravenously had it been non-fiction.  A true story written by its little life astronaut who opted to track for us the situation given here?  I'd have been all over that.)<br /><br />And I understand what it was the author was trying to gift to us but for me it just wasn't enough.  I commend him for giving a voice to this tortured teen but I needed something more to feel like I'd experienced something remarkable.  Still, the read was decent enough that if I see Mark Haddon's name on any future works, I'll consider handing him my hard-earned money because I do believe he's a gifted writer and capable of producing stories of substance.  This one, however, just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I thank you for your time.<br /><br />- tnt enough that if I see Mark Haddon's name on any future works, I'll consider handing him my hard-earned money because I do believe he's a gifted writer and capable of producing stories of substance.

0345803485|2.0|In an age of trilogies, especially after the recent hunger games success, people are after trilogies - this one was highly recommended to me by a neighbor who had yet to read the book.  I am not at all anti-sexual content in art as long as it has meaning to the story and characters.  In the first book, it did - it added elements of personality to the main characters.  But then the elaborate narratives about the sexual acts really got boring in book 2 and 3.  You keep reading because you wait that after this long wait, something must happen but don't read any further, nothing really happens. It is sad because this author is quite talented given her plot and character development in book 1.  She just got too caught up in the success, I think.  I was an english major. She developed lovely characters, 2 of whom she developed very well, The rest 10, well why did she even give life to them.  If you think, this will be like the hunger games, it is NOT.  This is the type of book sold in groceries stores with half dressed men and women line the covers.

0345803485|3.0|I read this book without knowing anything about it, and I found it to be more disturbing than erotic.  Coming from a therapist, I guess that's an appropriate observation.  I found myself wanting to counsel both Grey and Ana!!!  The sex was very REPETITIVE and just not that believable or arousing (for me), I do understand there is a group of people who really enjoy that lifestyle...<br />Its really hard to believe that a 21 yr old virgin with no computer or e mail address is even considering this lifesyle/way of sex/F-ing, is able to have earth shattering orgasm...OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER....REALLY???<br /><br />In summation...I read because I was curious, but not curious enough to read the sequels.  I prefer the vulgarness of Zane!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is simply a great read.  It will pull you away into literally, a whole other world with characters well-developed enough to feel like friends after the first book, let alone the third book.  The author is very creative in her world-building while keeping concepts simple enough for the novel to remain a youth novel.  While the books have been talked about for their romantic aspects (which are extraordinarily well done), this is merely one strong thread in a plot complex with politics, deception, family, and the skills (often unanticipated) that one needs to survive.<br /><br />If you are a parent considering whether or not this book would be appropriate for your child, do be aware of the violence in the books (not horribly graphic, but pervasive in all 3 books).  No worries about language or sex.  If you let your child watch PG-13 movies, then they are ready for \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />For a quick plot summary - imagine the world as we know it - gone.  A war of massive proportions has dissolved all current governments, and all that is left are 13 \\"districts\\" headed by one government: Panem.  To exert its control over the districts, the government destroys district 13 completely and then forces the other 12 districts to offer up 2 children each year and enter them in the Hunger Games - a fight to the death with only 1 winner.  The first novel follows Katniss and Peta as they are chosen to compete in the games.  While the fight for life inside the arena rages,the first sparks of a fight for freedom from the corrupt government begin to grow on the outside.  The second novel (MY FAVORITE OF THE THREE) finds another year passed and another Hunger Games on the horizon.  This time, however, past Hunger Game WINNERS are thrown back into the arena for an incredibly creative game fought by the best survivors from several generations.  Their fight to come out alive a second time turns into a fight to change the world they return to.  Which leaves us with the third novel - a book about a rebellion long overdue, led by Panem's surviving greatest competitors.  The Hunger Games tributes bring the games to the very capitol itself where once again, there can only be one survivor - the government or the people.<br /><br />This summary does not even hint at the wonderful language, characters, and incredible creativity of the author.  The beauty of these books is definitely in their execution.  As some characters are lost, new (and just as wonderful) characters are introduced.  The villains are incredibly complex for Youth Fiction.  The author beautifully shows characters as they walk the line between winning and winning at all costs - which might turn someone into the very thing they are fighting against.  Again, the world building is amazing (the details of the games are so much fun, as are the descriptions of the districts and the capitol and its people).<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is in the third novel.  While I certainly am glad that the author did not focus too heavily on the love-triangle while the entire Hunger Games world is at war, the way she handles its resolution is lacking.  So many other plot threads are wonderfully tied up and resolved - to leave the love story where she did really creates a serious imperfection.  It wouldn't have taken much - one or two scenes added between the characters (and one real breakout scene between Katniss and the one she does eventually fall in love with) - and this thread too could have given the incredible satisfaction that the rest of the book gives.  It's really so bad - I am convinced they will change the end for the movie versions!  No director is going to direct that...<br /><br />Still - this series ABSOLUTELY is worth the hype and all the praise it has received.  Collins steps into some mighty big shoes (those of J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyers) to make reading a true pleasure.<br /><br />Carrie Salo<br />Author of the Supernatural Thriller - The Soundingus with the third novel - a book about a rebellion long overdue, led by Panem's surviving greatest competitors.

B007MAETA8|4.0|John Mayer's new CD is more stripped and rootsy than his previous releases, pushing his vocals and guitar work to the fore. Produced by Don Was, the songs sound like they came from another age; simple, introspective and melodic.<br /><br />Standouts include \\"Shadow Days\\" (with Mayer singing \\"I ain't no troublemaker, and I never meant her harm\\"), the tender ballads \\"Born And raised\\" (with nice harmonica - it gets reprised at the end in a cheery Country/Gospel vein), \\"If I Ever Get Around To Living\\", the Bluesy \\"Love Is A Verb\\", \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\\" (with Chris Botti giving a great trumpet overture and tenderly plucked strings), and \\"Whiskey Whiskey Whiskey\\" (with such lovely harmonies and sprinklings of harmonica).<br /><br />This may catch fans of his earlier more heavily produced albums off guard, but you can see this is from Mayer's heart.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|After publishing my romance novel, Painter of Dreams, and having no idea how to market it, I chanced upon this book.  It was a lucky find, maybe even a Godsend, as it offers some useful suggestions, which I intend to try.  All John says makes sense to me.  In fact, I was so impressed that I bought a second copy for a writer friend who intends to epublish his thriller but has little to no experience in marketing.  I'll also recommend this book to other writer friends as I'm grateful that John shared his marketing secrets with those of us who are struggling to be read in this vast digital sea. If you're reading this, thank you, John.
B007H9B6KA|4.0|It's hard to believe it's been 17 years since Garbage released their eponymous debut. I've loved their singles \\"1 Crush\\", \\"Push It\\", \\"Special\\", \\"Cherry Lips\\" and more. Their latest release \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" is more of the same melodic Electro Rock with Hip Hop leanings. \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" (with vocodered vocals), \\"Big Bright World\\", \\"Blood For Poppies\\" (\\"I don't know why they are calling on the radio\\" Shirley Manson sings) aim straight for the jugular.<br /><br />Other upbeat rockers are \\"Felt\\", \\"I Hate Love\\" (which reminds me of \\"Push It\\", Manson purrs like Debbie Harry here - this is my favourite), the chugging \\"Battle In Me\\" (with stop/start effects in the chorus), and \\"Man On A Wire\\". Slowing things down are \\"Control\\", the Americana-tinged \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\", the atmospheric \\"Sugar\\" (remniscent of \\"Milk\\", another standout), and closing ballad \\"My Beloved Freak.<br /><br />I would urge you to get the deluxe edition which includes the frenetic \\"The One\\", the rocker \\"What Girls Are Made Of\\", the woozy ballad \\"Bright Tonight\\", and the sublime \\"Show Me\\" with clever layering perfectly showcasing Manson's crystal clear vocals, yet another standout and worth getting the deluxe for this alone.<br /><br />It's almost like those 17 years never went by.

B007N0REX6|4.0|When Slash released his debut solo album in 2010 it featured a wide and diverse selection of artists from the like of Ozzy to Fergie, Lemmy to Adam Levine as well as spots for Nicole Scherzinger, it was an album that worked well and featured a standout track in \\"By The Sword\\" sung by Andrew Stockdale of Wolfmother. The album also featured two songs by Alter Bridge frontman Myles Kennedy who would also go on to front Slash's group for his world tour during which he would sing songs from Slash's former bands as well as tracks from the album, so every night Kennedy would be filling the shoes of Axl Rose, Scott Weiland, Andrew Stockdale, Ian Astbury and Chris Cornell it was a job that he performed admiringly as his voice handled all the different ranges. So for Slash's second album Kennedy performs all the tracks, it seems like a natural progression and a working relationship has been built up by the two men.<br /><br />The album itself \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" is a rock fuelled funk filled adrenaline rush of old school rock and roll and it's clear from the outset that the album has one intention and that's to rock, it's an album full of great riffs such as the opening song the title track \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" with its funk driven riff that has Myles Kennedy using his full vocal range to drive the song on and features a great sing along chorus. \\"One Last Thrill\\" starts out with a scream in the background before Kennedy delivers the lyrics at 100 miles rate; it's a great piece of punk rock. It shows Kennedy has many different styles of vocals. It's also topped off by a trademark Slash solo. There's some great drumming and bass playing from Brent Fitz and Todd kerns on the song \\"Standing In The Sun\\", both Fitz and Kerns are part of slash's live band.<br /><br />The song \\"Anastasia\\" starts out with a gentle flamenco style acoustic guitar (think end of double talkin' jive) before kicking into a \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" riff and changes again and features a great solo from slash as well as Kennedy going from low to high with his vocal. \\"Bad Rain\\" has a pure rock swagger about it with its pounding drums and a grooving riff. The first single \\"You're A Lie\\" is a good indication of the album with its killer chorus and sleek guitar playing, it shows how much the Slash and Myles Kennedy partnership has grown.<br /><br />Slash seems to have found his perfect frontman foil in Myles Kennedy and \\"Apocalyptic Love\\" is an unashamedly full blown rock album, one that owes much to Slash's 70's rock influences. It will be interesting to see where they go from here as the they continue to gel even more, Slash has stated in recent interviews that making the album was the most fun he's had in a long time and listening to the album its clear to hear the chemistry that they have.

B007H9B6KA|4.0|It's been seven years since Garbage released their last studio album 2005's \\"Bleed Like Me\\", in that same year the band ended a world tour abruptly that saw the band cancel the end of their tour and go on an indefinite hiatus, it seemed the band had reached the end of the road as they were sick of record label interference, life on the road and sick of the sight of each other, after all this is a band that always had a fiery relationship with each other that had seen many a studio bust up. So as lead singer Shirley Manson went off to make a solo album (which has never been released) as well as star in the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles and drummer Butch Vig went back to producing albums it seemed unlikely Garbage would end their hiatus. Thankfully that all changed as the band regrouped and confirmed work had begun on a new album that would be released on their own STUNVOLUME label, it seemed that working without a major label suited the band and that they were all getting on and (whisper it quietly) having fun working together again. So finally we have studio album number five \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" an album which features all the hallmarks of Garbage's signature sound of a rock/pop fusion.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" which is a disco filled rock song that has Manson saying she won't be anybody's \\"Dirty Little Secret\\", the song has a big pounding beat and some distorted vocals; it's a great way to kick off the album. \\"Big Bright World\\" is reminiscent of the Version 2.0 era with its slow build up before exploding into life. The first track we got to hear from the album was \\"Blood for Poppies\\" which at the time seemed a strange choice as the lead single but it's a song that will grow on the listener over time and features a trippy breakdown towards the end. One of the standout tracks is \\"control\\" with its intelligent use of a harmonica and big beats with a chopped up vocal effect and a great lyric in \\"It's always darkest before the dawn\\".<br /><br />The title track \\"Not Your Kind of People\\" which is a slow paced song which has a dreamy 70's sound with a guitar at time not sounding unlike Lynard Skynards \\"Freebird\\". If there is one thing Garbage did better than anybody it is on big sounding numbers such as \\"Vow\\" from their debut album and with the song \\"Battle In Me\\" that is what Garbage do, it's a big sounding track with an aggressive vocal from Manson and a big heavy guitar/drum chorus, it's a song made for playing live. \\"Man On A Wire\\" is another stomper that's played at 100 miles per hour. Former Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery (who will play bass on the bands tour) plays bass on both \\"Battle In Me\\" and \\"Man On A Wire\\". \\"I Hate Love\\" is another dance rock track that's full of effects.<br /><br />It's good to have Garbage back with album number 5 which is a strong return for the band and shows there's still plenty of life left in them yet and it seems the time apart has revitalised them and got them on the same page musically again. There's plenty on here for long-time fans of the band and hopefully convert some new fans.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash makes his solo return with his second album Apocalyptic Love. After listening to it a couple of times, i think that it is a nice upgrade from his solo debut. Apocalyptic Love has a more connected feel about it that better showcases Slash`s trademark no-fills rock along with fine support from Miles Kennedy and the Conspirators. Listening to the album, it is very obvious how well they have gelled together after a lot of touring in the last year.<br /><br />Overall i highly recommend Apocalyptic Love to anyone that loves no-fills, balls to the wall rock.

B007RRFUHM|5.0|It is fanatic to finally have some music to listen to by an artist who has her own input into what is being released, rather than just a mouth piece for the record label.<br /><br />Vows is a wonderful alternative to the pop world. In vows I was taken on a journey to unexpected places which after the first listen you just have to dive straight back in and listen some more. The exciting thing is Kimbra has admitted she has so much more to learn. I look forward to seeing her future music its going to be a great trip! For now, I have to get back to Vows and become lost again in this album.

1469984202|4.0|So I am patiently waiting for the third book... I agree with all the other reviewers that this is a good book.  There are not many other options like this,<br />I keep looking.  This is a story you will walk around throughout your day and wonder about how the characters are doing.  BUT..... it could have been<br />so much better.  I would like to recommend the book \\"The Breakout Novelist\\" by Donald Maass to the author, to suggest he ramps it up a bit, a little<br />more action, more of the feeling of being at the top of the carnival ride the zipper, suspense, punch me in the gut, please!  It is so close to being perfect.<br />Overall it works, but it seems like it could have satisfied so much more.  The second book - Second Shift, is worth a read, same dragging, waiting to long<br />for something to happen, but it does quench the thirst.  Please read the writing book Mr. Hughey, you got what it takes, thank you.  Also I have requested the library stock the book, and my local Books A Million.  When is the next one ready??

B005LAIGPA|1.0|If your an adult, save your hard earned bucks, this one is for the kiddies. Reminds me of those silly made for tv shows for teens on saturdays way back in the eighties. Almost everything you see in this is shot by lead guys hand-held camera, he takes it to school, \\"here's my school\\" around the house \\"say hello to my new camera Mom\\", etc. Was there a script or was this all done off the cuff. I need a refund for this jewel! Wish i could give it a half of a star.

0307949486|4.0|I found the story interesting, and yes, disturbing at times. While I found parts of it, including the conclusion, to be inevitable or easy to figure out, I did not guess who the villain was which kept me interested. There is a finish to the initial story line after the murders but it's common in many books to spend time with a story at the beginning and end of the book with another the 'center' of it so that didn't bother me and I found it interesting as, if nothing else, we learn more about who our main characters are. I have just begun the second novel and look forward to learning more about 'Sally'. ;)<br /><br />I realize that some people were upset about the sexual violence in it but it reality it was very little of the book. The scenes, with the exception of the end of the main story line, were short and rather impersonal (due at least in part to the translation in my opinion). They were not drawn out or in my opinion graphic. Romance novels have a LOT more graphic info. The crimes were mainly written out and described, not lingered on or approached with a great deal of emotion that might have made it harder to read. Think the calm reading out of circumstances in a L&O: SVU episode.<br /> I would think the sexual lives of the main characters would be more disturbing. Our MC is sleeping off and on for the last 20 years with his best friend, and practically the permission of her husband. It ruins his marriage and during the course of the year he takes up with a neighbor and our heroine. His friend/partner may not mind but they aren't so willing to live within a triangle many times over and I don't blame them. This part of his personality was way beyond my comprehension. Lisbeth admittedly doesn't care who she sleeps with if she's in the mood. It may sound like and admirable quality of looking over labels of \\"gay\\" or \\"straight\\", whatever. I don't agree but then that's between the author who wrote her and the reader who connects with her.<br /><br /> I did like Lisbeth, though she was far from perfect and had her issues as well. At least she seems to have come by them honestly (through past trauma which I believe will be laid out in book 2). I heartily agree with her sentiment that no matter what happens to you, you don't get to fall back on it when you make a decision that's wrong. If she were to be caught she wouldn't play a blame game. She's not a perfect person, far from it. But she recognizes her issues and tries to function the best she can in the ways she knows how. I'm certainly looking forward to reading more with her.sbeth, though she was far from perfect and had her issues as well.

B005HW21Y4|5.0|Take a slice of Harry Dresden, add a pinch of Buffy/Angel, throw in some Sookie Stackhouse and you have a recipe for success.<br />Atticus, the 2100 year old druid (who only looks to be about 21 - don't worry, the explanation makes sense) runs a Pagan/Mysticism shop in Tempe, Arizona. He has a sword that Aenghus Og, of the Irish Pantheon wants - and he's coming to get it!<br />There are plenty of mystical and mythical creature in the pages of this book - Gods and Goddessess, witches, a Vampire and Werewolf legal team - and they all fit well within the story. There's always something going on but it doesn't feel rushed or overbusy. I am looking forward to reading more books in this series.<br /><br />Oh, yes, and there is Oberon the Irish Wolfhound, Atticus' pet - possibly the greatest dog character ever written and an excellent comic foil at times
B005LAIGPU|4.0|As a kid did you ever daydream about acquiring some kind of superpower? Of course you did. But the real question is what did you do with the power in your dream? Did you use it for good? Evil? A little of both maybe?<br /><br />Chronicle seemingly starts off as a drama about a kid in a Seattle high school that really doesn't fit in and progressed to a movie about finding that superpower that we've all dreamed about when we were kids. Okay, okay....that power we still dream about even as adults! To make things interesting this kid happens to be with his popular-on-campus cousin and one of his cousin's buddies when they stumble upon an object that grants them telekinetic abilities. The result is a sometimes funny, sometimes dramatic and a lot of times action filled movie that I pretty much enjoyed from start to finish.<br /><br />There has been no shortage of hand-held camera and found-footage films to come out in the past few years, and Chronicle adds to that list. Chronicle did the hand-held thing quite well without a lot of shaky footage and \\"dropped the camera\\" shots. But I still never got the point as to why the director chose the hand-held format versus presenting a cleanly produced film. I guess in this day and age of YouTube everything it just seemed like the \\"in\\" thing to do.<br /><br />Fortunately, I thought that the hand-held silliness was made up for by a uniquely written script by Max Landis (son of Writer/Director vet John Landis). And the mostly TV actor cast of three performed their roles with believability and emotion.<br /><br />While the final 15 minutes of this short 90 minute film were a little offsetting and not quite as believable, I'd still recommend this movie to any fan of the superhero genre. And the door has been left wide open for a decent sequel that could continue into a saga of how to become a superhero.<br /><br />Buy it or at minimum put it in your queue.

B0072X2O66|5.0|well,let me start by saying if u are looking for this to sound like dream theater(mike portney)or symphony x(russell allen)dont bother getting this cd.it doesnt sound like either of those bands,but why should it?? i dont think mike portney and russell allen would put together a new band just to have it sound the same as the music they have already been doing.with that said,if u will listen to this with an open mind and not compare it to the bands these guys are in(or have been in)it kicks some serious butt!!! mike orlando does an incredible job on guitar & bass sounding a lot like zakk wylde(ex-ozzy osbourne)at times.russell allens voice is amazing as always & mike portney definitely beats the hell out of his drum kit.this is more or less a straight up heavy metal/hard rock cd with some melody throwed in,mabye even a possible radio hit or two(oh,no not that).i would recommend this to anyone who likes their music loud and in your face.great songs and great production,play it loud and proud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006NXI58M|5.0|Absolutely riveting.  I was constantly on edge with anticipation.  The story is unpredictable and intense.  I couldn't put it down and was pleased I had purchased the trilogy so I was able to go straight to the next book.  The story line is thought provoking and cleverly written, like a puzzle unraveling without you even realizing. If you relate it to our world it leaves you wondering about our own humanity.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I realize this book was written for titillation and not literary greatness but if I read \\"geeze\\" or \\"oh my\\" or \\"what does that mean\\" one more time I may have thrown my Kindle away!  If Ana was a university grad she should have asked for her money back. Also very difficult reading about a supposed intellegent young woman thinking she was in love with an abusive, controlling man. Considering the hype very disappointing.

Overall, this trilogy was worth buying.

0671042858|5.0|Though horror king Stephen King's books have no shortage of monsters, the best of his horrors emerge when real life people come face to face with the monsterous that exists in reality itself.<br /><br />In this book 9 year old Trisha McFarland comes very much face to face with reality's most monsterous.  Little Trisha's trip starts with an innocent seeming nature walk with her mother and older brother and ends...let's just say...not so well.<br /><br />As Trisha's journey takes her deeper into the Maine/New Hampshire woods it also takes the young girl deeper inside her worst fears as she faces her worst nightmares.<br /><br />It's King's ability to seemlessly develop the story along all its various permutations that marks his skill as a master story teller.  To be sure this is not one of Stephen King's greatest stories but it remains great story telling nonetheless.<br /><br />With King as our guide no venture towards horror goes unrewarded or should I say, unpunished.
0439023513|4.0|The third and final book in Suzanne Collins's [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] trilogy completes Katniss's story by taking her experiences to the next logical (and inevitable) step. In hindsight, the progression of the three-book storyline is obvious: Katniss goes from a tribute in a gladiatorial death-match, to getting caught up in the revolution that follows, to this: her participation in a full-scale war.<br /><br />Rescued from the arena at the conclusion of [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]], Katniss now finds herself recovering in District 13, a place long thought to have been destroyed by the Capitol, but in actuality existing as a vast underground complex. Her teammate and would-be love interest Peeta was not so lucky, for he was captured by the Capitol and is now being used as an instrument of propaganda by the sinister President Snow. Due to their home in District 12 being bombed, Katniss and other survivors/refugees from the mining community have joined forces with District 13's resistance fighters, though it would seem that their every act of kindness is hedged with self-interest.<br /><br />Katniss, her mother and sister, and her childhood friend Gale are moderately safe in the extensive underground bunkers of District 13, where schedules are tattooed in impermanent ink on everyone's arm each day and wasting food or other resources is tantamount to a criminal offense. Naturally, Katniss chaffs under the imposition of these strict rules, but luckily for her, she's got some leverage. Having made herself infamous through her actions in the Hunger Games, the resistance wants her to become a symbol of the uprising, using her status as the Mockingjay to unite the remaining eleven districts.<br /><br />She agrees, but not before laying down a few conditions of her own. It's at this point that we see Katniss finally become more aware of her own power as well as (paradoxically) her inherent helplessness. On the one hand, she's a valuable asset and thus has a certain amount of say in District 13's decision-making; on the other, District 13 is just as capable of manipulation, cruelty and exploitation as the Capitol, and Katniss sees firsthand the lengths to which they'll go to in order to destroy the totalitarian regime of President Snow and the Capitol. Can she be a part of it without compromising herself?<br /><br />Once again she finds herself in the Hunger Games - though of a slightly different sort this time. Now the cameras are trained on her as she visits hospitals, rallies the districts, and consoles her wounded compatriots. She's become a part of the propaganda machine, and struggles to maintain her own agency and personality in the progress. Clearly suffering from the first signs of PTSD (complete with concussions, drug-use, on-going injuries and nightmares) Katniss also struggles with the knowledge that everything she does to rile the Capitol may be putting the captive Peeta into danger.<br /><br />It all comes to a head in a nail-biting game of cat and mouse with in the streets of the Capitol itself, and in the climactic final gambit played out by Katniss.<br /><br />It was with interest that I read some of the other reviews for \\"Mockingjay\\", particularly the ones that gave it a lower rating. Notably, there seems to be a definite disconnect between what people were expecting, and what Collins delivered. Is this a dark but ultimately uplifting story about a girl who becomes a hero and leads a rebellion to victory at a large but ultimately necessary cost? Or is it a story about the effect that war and death have on young people, how both sides of the conflict can be morally grey, and how people have only so much strength in them before they break? It's the latter, but lot of people wanted the former, and it's clear that they're judging \\"Mockingjay\\" not on what it is, but what they wanted it to be. Naturally everyone will have a series of expectations whenever they crack open any book (especially one as anticipated as this one), but I also think that Collins had a specific message to impart, and ignoring it is to miss the very point of the trilogy.<br /><br />For example, Collins makes some very interesting storytelling decisions throughout. For the last two books President Snow has been set up as Katniss's primary antagonist; the ultimate foe that she will one day face (it's even foreshadowed in their names: Snow versus the Girl on Fire). Yet without giving too much away, their confrontation is not what you'd expect. Likewise, there is a rather unconventional resolution to the love triangle that many may not find satisfactory. Personally, I was never in any doubt as to which of the two boys Katniss would chose, but the way in which is occurs is hardly what you'd call a \\"fairytale ending.\\"<br /><br />However, there are some parts of \\"Mockingjay\\" where I can understand why readers were a bit disgruntled. The death toll is extremely high; I wasn't keeping count, but there's a good chance that more named characters (I'm including the minor ones in this) end up dead than the living. In this case, Collins's gift is also her curse: by creating characters that you care about so quickly and so deeply, it is gut-wrenching when several of them not only die, but do so in a swift and anti-climactic manner. Sure, she's trying to make a statement about the randomness of war, but it's hard not to think that some characters deserved more - if not their lives, than at least a meaningful death.<br /><br />Although the writing is still as strong as ever in terms of its pacing and clarity, there are times in which Collins trips up. About halfway through the book, Katniss sings a haunting (and highly symbolic) song called \\"The Hanging Tree\\". Instead of Collins simply leaving the reader to interpret its meaning, she has Katniss internally analysis it for the benefit of the reader (taking up two pages!), thus robbing it of all its mystery. There are a couple of times in which she breaks the \\"show, don't tell\\" rule, breaking down various situations instead of letting the reader figure it out for themselves. (Though ironically, the most crucial gambit that Katniss plays toward the end of the novel seems to have been *too* subtle, given that many readers have expressed confusion over it. Or maybe most readers are used to being spoon-fed answers, thus justifying Collins's early attempts to spell things out. Who knows). Yet Collins's strength in writing is still apparent: her ability to maintain a riveting pace, in which everything flows smoothly from chapter to chapter, and suspense builds as the story goes on.<br /><br />Having a dig around some of the other reviews, I was disappointed (though hardly surprised) at the criticisms leveled at Katniss's characterization. Generally speaking, it's immensely difficult to write female characters, especially protagonists, as they will always be held to a higher standard than male characters. If she's too competent, too loved, too successful, she'll be deemed a Mary Sue. If she's too flawed, too fallible, or makes too many mistakes, then she's a bad role model and an affront to feminism.<br /><br />It feels as though that's what happened here. Many wanted her to step up as a hero and take control of every situation. Others dismiss her as \\"fickle\\" or \\"selfish\\" due to her interactions with Peeta and Gale (claims that baffle me considering her devotion to her sister and willingness to die for others). Others think she spent too much time under sedation, or gunning people down, or making the wrong decisions; and of course, with so much attention placed on the love triangle (not so much in the book, but certainly in on-line fan discussions - one can't help but feel that Stephenie Meyer's endorsements drew in the Twilight crowd) there were inevitably going to be disappointed shippers who would accuse Katniss of making \\"the wrong choice\\" no matter what boy she chose. So what was she: too good to be true, or a disappointing female character?<br /><br />Actually, she was neither. She was a seventeen year old girl who goes through a devastating ordeal, and the crux of this trilogy is that the reader shares in her terror, her self-loathing, her mental collapse, and her gradual crawl back to some degree of normality. It's a grueling experience, but one that's unflinching in revealing the true cost of war.<br /><br />So thank you Suzanne Collins for giving me Katniss: a three-dimensional, fully developed character who was nothing like me, and yet who I could relate to completely. Sometimes she failed, sometimes she succeeded, but she's embroiled in a story that is complex without being convoluted, and which raises difficult questions about the world without providing any sort of simplistic answer. The character development reflects this, for Collins doesn't make it easy: not for Katniss and not for the reader, and in my opinion, this uncompromising storytelling makes the complete trilogy stronger as a result. Will it be a classic? Only time will tell, but were I to place money on it, my bet would be yes., don't tell\\" rule, breaking down various situations instead of letting the reader figure it out for themselves.

0345803507|3.0|Christian had so many mood swings, he should be committed.  I was looking forward to reading this book after reading the preceding ones, but I have to say it felt like I was reading them over again. I needed the story to develop into one where Christian and Ana are taking their relationship to the next level.  It just seems as if the sex just continued and continued at the same pace and the relationship is only built on this overwhelming sexual attraction.  I expected to read more about Ana's relationship with Kate, Taylor and Mia.  Kate's relationship with Elliott and Christian's relationship with Elliott and how those relationship impacted Christian and Ana. I realize that this book is an Erotic Romance novel, but my goodness, it is unrealistic for people to recover from an organism that fast and go right back into another one.

And once initialized, the screens are attractive and functional.  The home page even displays wind speed and direction information.

Overall, an attractive design that is easy to use and functionally superior to other weather apps.

From the first few pages I knew that he would become one of my favorite authors because he doesn't try to fill your head with nonsense, but instead encourages you by introducing new ways of thinking and being more open minded. I really enjoy this book and look forward to reading more by him.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|One of my fondest childhood memories was from a family vacation to Paris.  Of all the wonderful things in that city, one place struck me the most, and my memories, upon a recent revisit, were relit: The Grand Gallery of Evolution.  The Grand Gallery is organized far different than American museums.  The entire structure is dedicated to placing Darwin's theory of natural selection right in front of you, to let your eyes see the story of life itself.  There are few colorful placards, no special themed exhibits, or other things tailored to appeal to pop sensibility.  Instead, the viewer is faced with endless rows of skeletal fish, reptiles, amphibians, marsupials, mammals, and crustaceans in one chamber, and a less dense collection of dinosaur fossils in the other room.  The skeletons in the first chamber are each placed amidst related species, so as to indicate their shared heritage.  The collection spans the smallest fish to the largest whales, the most humble toad to fearsome land predators.  There is one particularly morbid shelf that places infant skeletons side-by-side of each ape species, including a human infant skeleton.  Above all this is a wide class ceiling window that allows light to pour through onto the specimens.  No artificial light is necessary to view life's grandeur.<br /><br />The Grand Gallery, through the sheer brute facticity of physical evidence, proves what Dawkins in his latest book \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" proves through citation and argument.  Because of his crusading against theism during the 00s, it can be easy to forget that Dawkins is one of the titanic names of evolutionary biology.  Not only did he pioneer research into the role played by genetic competition in competitions between organisms, but he has written multiple \\"user-friendly\\" guides to the mechanics and intellectual debates within evolution.  With this most recent tome, however, Dawkins seeks to provide a much-needed guide to the evidence that proves Darwin's theory.  He covers a wide variety of different \\"sectors\\" of evolutionary evidence, ranging from fossil dating, comparative anatomy, modern genetics, paleoanthropology, and others.  He tackles each of these subjects, and demonstrates that when the study of life is approached with the scientific method in hand, it's impossible not to see the incredible explanatory power of Darwinism.  Although Dawkins frequently addresses creationist critiques of evolutionary theory throughout the text, this book has both an effect and appeal beyond those who want to disprove the nonsense known as \\"Intelligent Design.\\"  Dawkins succeeds in paying homage to the awe-inspiring natural history of life itself.  The book entertains and inspires, as well as informs.<br /><br /> \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" is not just some recap of your high school bio courses either.  Dawkins is a genuinely talented scientific writer, and his style aids greatly in absorption of the information he presents.  However, Dawkins also tells the story of how modern science finally discovered natural selection, along with all the bumps and failures along the way.  Furthermore, and this is something I give him a lot of credit for, Dawkins discusses the epistemological challenges that evolutionary biology has struggled to overcome throughout its development.  One of the most basic challenges that evolutionary biology faced in its formation, in terms of its conceptual apparatus, was with the way the human mind conceives of living beings themselves.  We like to think of living organisms as fixed species, and our complex taxonomical systems help perpetuate this illusion.  As Dawkins states though, life is Heraclitean, not Platonic.  It is always in flux.  Organisms are bundles of genes which constantly compete with each other for expression.  All evolutionary changes are contingent by essence.  They depend on the pressures and mutations that an individual organism faces.  They do not fit into a master plan, and it is clear that there is no intelligence behind their design, at least in the sense that Creationists argue.  The physiological and behavioral characteristics that genes express can shift in their usage, and reconfigure to push evolution onwards.  Feathers were originally \\"meant\\" to keep certain dinosaur species warm, or perhaps aid in sexual selection.  However, at some point, natural selection pushed this characteristic towards usage in flight.  The eventual usage of feathers for flight was entirely contingent.  Evolution easily could have pushed the avian dinosaur species in another direction.  This is the same reason, as Dawkins points out, why bats have an entirely different means of flight from birds, because the means by which they gained the ability to fly was contingent.  It was based on certain selection pressures they faced at a certain point in their natural history, and was based on what biological tools bats already had in their repertoire, which didn't necessarily have anything to do with flight beforehand.  Also, many seemingly complex devices, such as eyes, go through phases of increasing (and sometimes decreasing) complexity, but not because they are working towards an end goal, but because natural selection pushes them in different directions at different points in evolutionary history.<br /><br />Some of the most fascinating pieces of evidence that Dawkins provides are recent, and highly successful, attempts at recreating species evolution in laboratory settings.  By simply exposing microrganisms, inspects, and fish into controlled settings, it has been demonstrated that evolution, and huge leaps in evolution at that, can occur before our very eyes.  Many changes that Creationists used to claim were impossible can actually be observed directly by the scientific process!<br /><br />Aside from this, Dawkins provides the reader with glimpses into the story of natural history in our own bodies, the organs of animals, the fossilized imprints of plants, and countless other sources.  The incredible thing, which I don't think I entirely grasped before reading this book, is that the evidence doesn't simply point to the fact that changes occur constantly throughout natural history, but that we can see the battles between competing genes as they're played out in the very bodily being of life itself.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have a high opinion of this book.  If you've been turned off by the sometimes boorish (although often insightful) things Dawkins has to say about organized religion, then I implore you to put aside your prejudices and read this book.  Dawkins is a lovely writer when you give him a chance.  If you affirm the scientific theory of Darwinism, but don't feel as if you really know much about evolution per se, then this book will go a long way in filling that gap.  If you're an ID proponent or a Creationist, then I double dog dare you to read this.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is easy to play but I cant put it down<br />when I have a couple minutes I play and play and play.  I love it
B004WR125O|5.0|I got this with my new AVR NR-809. Setup is very easy and the AVR recognized it right away. I tired both of the options (Manual and Push Button with PIN) to connect the device to my wireless router and both worked without any problem. Once the device was connected I tired Internet radio the DLNA and both of them worked just perfect.<br />This is a great product, just read the instruction first, it takes only 2 minutes of your time but once you know what to do it becomes so easy to set it up. I think this is a must if your AVR supports the Onkyo UWF-1 Adapter, it works and it is very cheap. Recommending it to everyone.
0345529057|4.0|There are the emotions, sentiments, rages, ambitions, calculations and egotism, lust, naïve and childish behaviors and options, mistakes and successes, suffering and false hopes and so on - more so in theses novels than anywhere else one reads nowadays - but that is not what sets George Martin from all the others. It's something great, something really \\"in tune\\" with reality, something that I might consider genius-like.
B007L96SI6|5.0|This album is funky, its retro, its jazzy, and its pop. She has stayed true to herself and this is a wonderful debut album for Ms. Reinhart and this album deserves a lot of success! The best tracks for me are Wonderland, Undone, and Hit the Ground Runnin'. Also, iTunes has the deluxe version with 4 bonus tracks, I highly recommend those as well. :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was very racy, but interesting at the same time.  The second book as well as the third book contained more \\"vanilla sex\\" and the \\"more\\" Anna so wanted from Grey.  She changed his life, as he did hers.  They grew together as a couple.  They faced problems and danger headon together (well Anna sometimes took on danger first and Grey would need to be the Prince Charming and rescue her right back).  It was nice to see their growth together as couple.  Love from their families embracing them also.  I would recommend reading the other 2 books, as they are nothing like the first book.  So if you are embarassed by the first book, please do not give up on romance as it is definately in the other two books.

0345803485|1.0|I read five pages and sent my Kindle version back for a refund. I was looking forward to it, but I never got as far as a raunchy part. How did this get by an editor? The author must have some dirt on somebody to get this published. Ms. James never met an adjective she didn't like, and apparently she never met a turn of phrase that couldn't be made better by its repetition 100 times. (I wasn't allowed to write like this in junior high school.) Alas, Amazon doesn't allow for half stars. I will stick to well-written anthologies for my erotica. Amazon has a ton of them.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|This album is an acknowledgment of the Native American people, but do not expect a heavy influence of Native American music. Also, If you are expecting \\"Supernatural 2012\\" you will be gravely disappointed. There is only one song with vocal verse and chorus, and it is in Spanish... That one song \\"Eres La Luz\\" is also a change-up for the mood of the album, offering a Latin dance beat on an album dominated by smooth, almost melancholy Jazz.<br /><br />The opening title track opens with Dennis Chambers offering a cool tom beat under Carlos Santana's signature style before settling into a 4/4 rock track with interplay between guitar and organ that was almost Deep Purplesque.<br /><br />Track 2, \\"Dom\\", is more mellow. Not sure of the time signature, but it ain't 4/4. Melancholy and moody.<br /><br />Track 3 brings back Dennis Chambers toms and some cool guitar riffage on \\"Nomad\\"... going between heavy and melodic with some fast soloing and more organ/guitar interplay. By the end of the song, the main riff is just about played out. I'm certain this song was born from a jam session.<br /><br />Track 4, \\"Metatron\\", is almost an anthem, if an instrumental can be. It's a bit short, but that works.<br /><br />Track 5, \\"Angelica Faith\\", brings back the smooth jazz feel. Organ is replaced with a more piano-like keyboard sound. Maracas add a touch of accent to an otherwise pedestrian rhythm track. This one doesn't feel particularly inspired.<br /><br />Track 6, \\"Never The Same Again\\", begins with a Spanish style acoustic guitar with a moody textural key sound, before changing to a mid tempo, jazz piece. Dennis Chambers has a backbeat that borders on funk with this one, with little variation after the initial intro.<br /><br />Track 7, \\"In The Light of a New Day\\", slows the pace again. It's relaxing, but reminded me of a GRP sampler disc. Midway through is an almost blistering solo that strongly contrast with this otherwise laid back mood of this one.<br /><br />Track 8, \\"Spark of the Divine\\", seems like an inspired intro to something greater, then quickly fades off into...<br /><br />Track 9, \\"Macumba in Budapest\\". Starts somewhat textural and relaxing, but then the drums build to a drum filled latin beat remenicent of Santana's former drummer, Michael Shrieve. Dennis Chambers drumming is complimented by a conga track, probably from an additional percussionist. The feel of this track continues with Track 10, \\"Mr. Szabo\\", dominated by Spanish acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Track 11 is \\"Eres La Luz\\", the only non-instrumental, mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Track 12, \\"Canela\\", slows the tempo down again. This one has a slow bluesy feel. An organ fills in the whole track, with Guitar and Piano trading off duties as main instrument (well, Guitar mostly). Almost reminds me of some slower paced SRV and Double Trouble.<br /><br />Track 13 \\"Ah, Sweet Dancer\\" ends it with some melancholy Guitar and Piano interplay.<br /><br />Overall, I feel that this is the most impressive work from Santana in years. He has a very skilled band, although fans of early Santana might prefer the syncopated drumming of Michael Shrieve to Dennis Chambers' jazzy \\"in the pocket\\" groove.the Divine\\", seems like an inspired intro to something greater, then quickly fades off into...<br /><br />Track 9, \\"Macumba in Budapest\\".

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Straight to the point, we LOVE this game! It's so variable, it teaches bargaining, strategy, saving, etc...<br /><br />I play this with my husband and 3 boys; ages 15, 13, 11. We do have 5 people, so we take turns being the banker. We've purchased the expansion pack, but haven't played it  yet. All of us love it. My boys' friends come over, and they always ask to play this (even over video games many times!)<br /><br />On a product note, we did find that the outside pieces start to warp a bit, which makes the board bubble up and become difficult. We found if we alternate which way we put them in the box this  helps. Also sometimes we have to manually \\"un-bow\\" them.

0547258305|5.0|Romance? Check. Adventure? Check. Flawed protagonist? Check. Formidable villain? check. Suspense? Double check. I would rate this almost comparable to hunger games, though maybe the romance part is much weaker. Katya is basically a killing machine that does not have any weakness, or so we thought. But she now has to run and be hunted by someone that can easily defeat her. Really great story with a lot of suspense.
B007LNJ4YW|2.0|Great material live, less enthralling in print.<br /><br />Loud. Overproduced -which should put people iffy about Teen Dream being well beyond their tolerance for it. Not a bad thing in-itself, but Bloom is what you might imagine the pre-Teen Dream releases to sound like if they had been given a 2x's Team Dream treatment in sound production.<br /><br />Experientially, a short ride in comparison to Teen Dream, lacking the sheer song writing and lyrical robustness of its immediate predecessor, as well as the sparse resonance of the more minimal production style of their first two releases.<br /><br />Voice and Mix. Legrand is utterly subsumed. Vocals are double-tracked and/or synth treated; we don't fully get to appreciate her presence and prowess except for the rare moment where the wall of sound erected around her is dropped back.<br /><br />It's an album to put on when entertaining company, the mixing favors listening with speakers.
0345803485|2.0|I haven't quite finished the first book. I'm about 75% into it.<br /><br />Too. much. repetition.<br /><br />The characters use the same facial expressions and are described the same over, and over, and over.<br /><br />They have sex pretty much every few pages. Her inner goddess and subconscious are mentioned almost every single page.<br /><br />So far I am not seeing any real plot or storyline, just a lot of sex. I can't imagine what book 2 and 3 are going to be about...... sex?<br /><br />I think that maybe this book was written just to feed the author's BDSM fantasies.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like sex in a book. But I'm pretty sure that realistically they should both be pretty raw by the amount that they have, and it's always the same descriptions.<br /><br />Since I bought the trilogy for $33 I'm going to finish reading it.

But I just don't care any more.<br /><br />Security pulls guns on Barney at the airport but he has no reaction? Barney's apartment is decorated like a Hello Kitty fanatic's place? How stupid.<br /><br />I haven't laughed with this show for a LONG time.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|Oh - Antony. Such a beautiful angelic creature. His presence is far beyond earthly mortals. His voice and music leaves the listener spellbound during an inward journey of sweetness and pain within the heart. This may sound utterly hokey to those who have never seen or heard this artist, but believe me, there really are no words that adequately describe how you feel while listening to his music. All his CDs contain precious jewels that reach in and grab the soul in a profound way. You won't forget nor regret the purchase, and like me, you will tell others.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|This book will keep you interested from the very beginning.  It has all the characteristics of a love story, but it also keeps you on the edge of your seat.  You cannot predict everything in this book like you can many other romance novels. This one is worth the $.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I was hopeless after I finished the Fifth Shades trilogy that I'd never find another book that would come close. I started this book and was finished within a day.  I can't wait until October 2012 for the second book.  This book ends waiting more! Great read about ups and downs and dysfunctional relationships!!!

B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I love this game, but unfortunately cannot give it a good rating because it drains the kindle fire battery super fast. After each turn, there are unnecessary graphic animations (stars on an orange screen). I suspect this is the problem. Too bad a great interactive game is ruined by poor design relative to battery life.
B001993Y2C|1.0|I purchased the product based on a few postings I read stating that this particular packaging of the product and the product itself are the best when one is trying to purchase the whole series.  I also thought that Blu-ray would be the best way to view the series as I had seen it all previously on DVD.  I am very disappointed.<br /><br />There are some scenes where the video and graphics are so poor, I can honestly say without hyperbole that my VCR has pictures of higher quality.  I was watching just last night the second installment on Disc 1 of Season 1 which is the second part of the miniseries.  When the President is in the botanical ship talking to the captain of the ship, the picture is so grainy it actually looks pixelated!  My TV is a 55\\" HD Samsung.<br /><br />There is no excuse for this.  Extra features and interactive menus does not a Blu-ray make!  The quality of Blu-ray is what I care about, not the packaging or other gimmicks.  I actually want my money back on this product.  The quality is marginal, at best.<br /><br />jbna

B006X415GK|5.0|This doll is amazing, I'm a collector of Monster high dolls, I currently own 15 of them.<br />I have to say  I just love this version of Frankie Stien.<br /><br />The doll is beautifull and well detailed, She is completely Monochrome.<br />Starting from the head down she has beautifull styled hair, Although I recommend washing the gel out with hot soap and water, It's much nicer without it.<br />Semi Metalic Makeup, And her stiches are also Metalic.  Something small that amused me is that if you look closely at the bolts on her neck (That are silver on this doll) They've gone to the trouble of putting the Screw detailing on it and making it look like and actual bolt, Her outfit is in two peices,  A swimsuit with a Skirt that wraps around it.<br /><br />She has earings but you can't see them that match her  Shoes and Bracelete.<br />She also comes with a stand.<br /><br />The doll is well jointed as all monster high dolls, And I was happy to see that all the joints on mine were tight,  And I couldn't be any happier.<br /><br />This doll was supposed to be and exclusive so I have no idea how she winded up on Amazon for Seven bucks, But it's a well seven bucks spent. (At least that's what I paid at the time.)
B005EGXTEE|4.0|A unique story that was very gripping. Writing quality wasn't amazing but the story line sucks you in that I read this book in record time and quickly downloaded the second and third novels in the series. A fun read that isn't to heavy.
0345803485|1.0|Kinky sex does not offend me.  Terrible writing does.<br /><br />If you liked the Twilight series, are a mousy, clumsy, emotional female, and have your fingers crossed that a billionaire is going to mistakenly think you're something special, read the book.  Otherwise save your time, money, and dignity, and read something (anything) else.
1416596585|5.0|As business biographies go, I have never been so enthralled by a piece of literature. Levy reveals the Googly character within every single major player of the organization since its beginnings. Levy is a master storyteller. The events, from the widely-publicized to the little-known, are told extensively, eloquently, and engagingly. Some of my favorite stories:<br /><br />--When Sergey Brin and Larry Page were pitching the CEO of Alta Vista on investing in Back Rub (PageRank), the CEO turned them down, saying that it was \\"too good\\" and that people wouldn't stay on the search page long enough to be optimally exposed to advertising.<br />--In trying to eradicate porn from search, Matt Cutts established \\"Look for Porn Day,\\" on which he would bring in cookies baked by his wife to entice other Googlers to help him find unwanted porn sites to block.<br />--In trying to perfect the algorithm, Googlers noticed at one point that a search for \\"running shoes\\" brought up a gnome wearing shoes and the engineers couldn't figure out how to fix the algorithm in order to remove it. So, one engineer went out and bought the gnome--thereby removing it from the search page.<br /><br />And these are just a few. The book is rather lengthy (20 hours audio), but I'd listen to it again and again. Google's drive for innovation and relentless mission to unleash public access to information is inspiring. One quote to live by that Levy presents us with toward the end of the account seems to be the enduring mantra of Googlers: \\"The best path to success is doing what conventional wisdom says you cannot do.\\"
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Even though i have not yet seen Thor, i thought this movie was great. It had lots of action, good special effects and some really good laughs. There was not one corny line of dialog in the whole movie, unlike others i have seen this year. This was a fun movie. A feel good movie. I did NOT look forward to the end of it, which again, has happened with other movies this year.<br />No matter if you see it in a Theater, rent it or buy it, it's a good movie to watch.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|My rating is purely based on the show.  It truly grabs your imagination and gets you emotionally involved with the characters.<br /><br />Technically speaking, disc 4 will not play on my blu-ray player.  I have to use my PS3 to watch that disc and I really hate that.  I don't know if it's a quality issue or what.  It also takes 5+ minutes for the player to load the discs that do work.  It may be my player but it's something interested parties should be aware of.
B0000DJZ8R|3.0|reading too much material on our economic future I see this as a deja vu for surviving this decade, deep sympathies evoked only when one can relate and I can only see this migrant path of seeking food and discrimination that perhaps this depression only ekes a sliver of what is to come... a testament to fortitude and just a dance could set minds flowing with abundance I doubt this will be the case in the near term, we will prolly look back and see how wonderful their lives were... no one had credit cards and hence significantly less debt, the assistance programs were more abundant and the global debt was negligible vs today, so hold on to ur tophats lads... wonder what Steinbeck would write today?

B00068TJM6|5.0|I have this watch with both the black face and the white face. I've had the white-face vesion for over 6 years, and I still love it as much today as when I bought it. I have never had any sort of problem with it: all the pain on the bezel is still in great shape, the crystal isn't too scratched... it has really held up. For a long time, it was my standard day-to-day watch, and I can be really hard on watches.<br /><br />But then, back in 2008, I saw a guy on the airport shuttle with the gold case/bracelet and black face version, and I couldn't stop staring at it - just beautiful, but I couln't be sure if it was just a different colored version of the one I was actually wearing at the time. (If the bus had been a bit less crowded, I would have just asked the guy.) So, I went online, hunted around, and sure enough, I found it. But, I don't really wear gold, so my next step was to find the silver version, which I did, and I bought it. Sure enough, it looks cooler than the white one, and for all those years I didn't even realize it came with a black face.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, and I still love this watch. But - and yes, this is the 'but' from my review title - I seem to have gotten a big of a lemon... I have to replace the battery weirdly often (I assume it's the battery, when the watch just stops running every few months, and then I replace the battery and it works for another few months). I have no idea why, but I can say I never had that problem with the white version... I think I've only changed that battery once since I've owned it. Maybe this one is secretly powering a military satellite or something. Anyway, the black one is also tighter on my wrist, or if I put a link in, too big. Again, just weird, since it is the same watch as the white one. (Aside from the military satellite thing, I guess...) Either way, this all makes me sad, because it really still is one of my favorite watches.<br /><br />I know what you're saying - \\"How can you give it 5 stars if you have to keep changing the battery!\\" I can do that because, 1) it is still one of the best looking watches I've ever seen; and 2) the white one I have has performed flawlessly for a very long time. I do believe the one I got is just a lemon, and is not representative of the true quality of this model. And for the record, no, no one is paying me to write this review, and I have no association with Seiko. I'm just another legit consumer who's a bit obsessed with cool watches. And this watch is cool. If it were solar, it would be absolutely perfect. (And that would also take care of the battery issue..., so that would be a double.)<br /><br />One *minor* gripe... the screw-in crown on *both* of these that I have is a bit of a pain to actually screw down. I really have to push them in and twist at the same time, and it usually takes me a few tries before I finally get it. As a result, I dread having to reset the date or the time. For a while on the white one, I just left it unscrewed, but eventually realized that was stupid - but not the hard way, thankfully. Initially, I assumed that all watches with a screw-down crown must have this problem; but then I got my Citizens BJ2004-08E - piece of cake. So, it's a design flaw. But it's still an awesome watch.

B007H9B8FS|4.0|I love this band and own every album they ever put out. I absolutely loved every song on every single album they've put out prior to this one, so I had very high hopes for this album, considering the long hiatus taken between albums. And while I like 80% of the songs on the album, I'm certainly not in love with this album the way I was with the others. Their sound seems a little bit different, but not drastically. Overall, if you're a Garbage fan then you should buy this.
0062112430|3.0|This book was definitely a unique experience. I feel like I'm the only reviewer who didn't completely fall in love with this book. It was really good, it just didn't pull me in the way it has other readers.<br /><br />The premise was what interested me. There are plenty of dystopians where the society appears perfect because any and all causes of discord are erased from the world, but never has the cause of all this been love. If you think about it, it makes sense. Love and hate influence much of what we do, and have been the cause of many problems in our society. What would the world be like if we erased those things? Would things be better or worse? I don't know, but I don't want to find out!<br /><br />I like the fact that this is set in an alternate-present, instead of a far-away future. I think that's something a lot of people didn't get, but to me it seemed clear that this isn't set sometime in the far future, but that their was a conflict sometime in the past that would've lead to the society being like this by now.<br /><br />Based on what I picked up from the story, the cure had been around for quite some time before Lena's story takes place. Because of this, I wonder how inventions such as the internet came about. Any great invention can't be invented without a passion burning behind it.<br /><br />I found the characters alright, but there wasn't anything to make me love them. Lena seemed kind of shallow. She did whatever she was told, regardless of what she should've done. That wasn't my biggest issue, though.<br /><br />There's a moment towards the end where she says something along the lines of `I only feel beautiful when Alex tells me I am' and that just wrecked her for me. If she doesn't like herself, why should I?<br /><br />The story felt really slow paced. It took 200 pages in before anything exciting happened. I didn't mind that so much. It made some room for world-building and getting to know the characters. After that, the pacing caught up and the story really began to pull me in,  keeping me captivated the whole way through.he story really began to pull me in,  keeping me captivated the whole way through.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Make no mistake about it, despite its simple, clean one-word title, Richard Ford's latest novel is an all-American story from start to finish.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Canada\\" takes place in Great Falls, Mont., in the 1960s at a time when quiet hometown streets were still crowned with elms and box elders. The second half jumps the 49th parallel and takes place in the same time period in and around the one-horse town of Fort Royal on the barren no-man's land of the southern Saskatchewan plains. Both parts make up an extraordinary and expansive story, as exhilarating as America at mid-century.<br /><br />This is an archetypical American tale where the life led by 15-year-old Dell Parsons and his twin sister Berner is mostly ordinary and conventional right up until the late summer morning when his parents drive off in the family's white-and-red '55 Chevrolet Bel Air and commit a bank heist that triggers what happens later.<br /><br />Ford's masterful, complete control of his story is such that an event so abnormal and preposterous as parents robbing a hometown bank becomes entirely plausible, even inevitable. Think about that, you're a kid and your mom and dad rob a bank and that it could happen just the way it did, with Dell and Berner's father Bev waving a .45 caliber service-issue pistol at one of the bank tellers and their mother Neeva driving the get-away car.<br /><br />After his parents are apprehended Berner flees to California hoping for a new life. Dell is spirited away, out of reach of juvenile authorities by his mother's friend Mildred. She drives Dell across the Canadian border where he is left in the care of her brother Arthur Remlinger, a disenchanted, exiled American, a Gatsby-esque rogue and force of nature who represents everything both wild and constrained about his former country. Remlinger has tried to escape a violent past that he can't outrun simply by crossing the border into Canada.<br /><br />Dell narrates the story. He's young, observant and thirsty for experience as only someone trying to define his place in the world can be. Taken on but not taken in by Remlinger, Dell is a witness to what being an American means and what that represents. \\"Canadians are hollowed out,\\" says Remlinger's hired hand Charley Quarters. \\"Americans on the other hand are all full of deceit and treachery and destruction.\\" The hired hand tells Dell that he loses something of his self south of the Canadian border. \\"Something goes out of me when I go down below. Then something goes out of me when I come back up here.\\"<br /><br />From the time he was young, Dell has approached life relying on a process he calls \\"reverse-thinking,\\" a trait he uses to find meaning by inverting the obvious, flipping the self-evident to get clarity and to arrive at the gist of an issue. An example of reverse thinking: Dell's parents, he tells us, were the least likely people to rob a bank. \\"They we just regular - although, of course, that kind of thinking became null and void the moment they did rob a bank. Ford also relies on a type of reverse-thinking to examine the American experience by contrasting it to life north of the national border.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first half more than the second, which reads almost like a frontier fable with shadow figures moving about with ominous portent. Both parts are equally keen at examining the whole of American experience from either side of the Canadian-American border.<br /><br />Ford lays out a central theme that unifies the story's two elements when he tells us how people are motivated to do things \\"outside of boundaries they knew to be right, and then found themselves unable to go back.\\"<br /><br />By the story's end we see Dell in late middle age and we learn how he has come to be shaped by ordinary people driven by choice and circumstance to do uncommon acts. In Ford's capable hands, Dell tells an extraordinary story.and thirsty for experience as only someone trying to define his place in the world can be.

1401235417|5.0|Rebooting the DC Universe from the ground up (for the most part) seems like a daunting task, but for writer Scott Snyder (Detective Comics, Swamp Thing, American Vampire) it's child's play.  Granted he isn't necessarily rebooting the Batman group, but building upon it in new and exciting ways.  Case in point with this first collected volume of The Court of Owls, in which the Dark Knight discovers that Gotham City's past is tied to a mysterious group known as the Court of Owls, which seemingly run everything in and out of the city, and have for quite some time.  Add to that a seemingly unstoppable assassin dubbed Talon and secrets involving the ancestors of Bruce Wayne, and you've got quite an intriguing and often surprising mystery on your hands.  A storyline that was heavily hinted at in the Gates of Gotham mini-series (that was published before DC's whole New 52 thing happened), The Court of Owls is setting the stage for a truly epic Batman event to unfold, and it's a wonderful entry point for new readers to boot.  Add to that the surprising art of veteran Greg Capullo, best known for his 90s work on Spawn.  I've never been a big fan of his, but he's really honed his craft here.  Some spots appear a little shaky compared to others, but this is without a doubt his best work to date.  All in all, if you've never read any Batman stories or have tuned out the past few years, this is an oh so excellent place to start.
B005K2XM94|5.0|I really like this case.  I almost didn't buy it because of the complaints about it being too tight of a fit......one even saying that it turned his Kindle on when he put it in the case.  I find the fit to be very good.  Snug but not hard to get the device in or out.  The material is what I like.  Casual and good quality. I recommend this case.

B003UESJH4|4.0|In the King's Speech, we see a perfectly able, decent man incapacitated by a disorder. What holds him back is stuttering, something that is caused by his unhappy past. Alas, he is no ordinary man and may just be forced to step up to a place of a king at a time of worldly crisis. Oh, the fear that must grip him! Not only of the nightmarish public embarrassment but even worse, the fear of failing to lead a nation (and perhaps a good part of the world) because of a seemingly small impediment that he fails to overcome.<br /><br />And that's the point of the speech disorder, I think. From my perspective, the entire person of King George VI seems so stupid because of his stuttering. I say to him, \\"Hey, what's the matter? Why are you stuttering? There's no reason for you to stutter! Just speak normally, like me. Now watch how I do it.\\" As I watched him battling his demon with the help of a mentor, I came to appreciate a little more the problems that people have, whatever they may be. Something that to me seems so easy to overcome may not be so simple to the person concerned.<br /><br />So, please, friends... Be kind to me and my many shortcomings. I am trying, really.
0545265355|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before I bought this trilogy.  At first I was afraid it would be too youth oriented for my personal taste.  But I was wrong.<br /><br />And I'm gonna have to disagree with a lot of the readers who complained about the last book.  There are definitely things that could have been done differently with the book.  Clearly I think there was enough material to maybe make 2 books.<br /><br />I've read some reviews about Katniss' character turning too dark and moody in the final book but honestly, she just had more of a stage to be dark and moody this time around considering everything she had been through.<br /><br />I fully expected someone (or possibly multiple someones) to die in the finale - it's inevitable so although I was sad I was not surprised.  If there was anything I would have liked to have seen was a little more closure of their respective relationships with Katniss.  To have Gale drift away almost unmentioned was odd.  And to have Kat decide is one summary sentence that Peeta was who she belonged with was even odder to me.  i don't care - it was irrelevant to me who she ended up with but just a little shaky on the loose ends.<br /><br />All in all a great book series.  Now I'm forced to go out and watch the first movie!  Although after reading the books I can tell you that I'm already disappointed in some character choices - namely Woody Harrelson for Haymitch.  Doesn't in any way match the character that evolved from the series.  But I'll wait and see I guess.

B003UESJEM|5.0|The Company Men is one of the most elegant, moving studies in the effects of corporate downsizing and Board level maneuvering to protect their own inflated salaries, bonuses, options, etc. at the expense of employees ranging from the lowly secretary to a divisional vice President who co-founded the company. The lie CEO's tell about corporate loyalty is that it is really only a one way street: you should be loyal to the company no matter what is asked of you, but it will only be loyal to you as long as it is convenient for the company. Some have criticized the movie for its focus on the higher level employees, and those critics sadly miss the point: those people, especially Chris Cooper's ill-fated 30 year veteran, invested large amounts of time and effort to reach the levels they were at. Yet, in the end they were just as expendable as the base line secretary.  The great achievement of the movie comes out the ending and the options people face when abruptly put into an unemployed situation after years of service and sacrifice for the company that just fired them: You can try applying to another ungrateful behemoth in hopes of landing a similar job, give up and end your life, or take the entrepreneurial approach and start your own business. As with the anti-materialistic \\"Fight Club\\" before it, I found it astounding that a movie such as this actually made it through the corporate system it harshly criticizes to even see the light of day.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My kids were reading this novel, so I picked it up via my Kindle Fire.  Within two pages I was hooked.  This one has everything, including a point: a dysfunctional society's abuse of its weaker members.  But this is not your ordinary anti-utopian novel.  The main character, for example, manages to be both feminine and tough; many authors have trouble pulling off this combination.  Too often tough female protagonists seem like males with a female name.  Not here.  Further, the depth of character development here is outstanding.  The reader instantly comes to identify with the protagonist, understand her motivations, and root for her.<br /><br />This story is told from the first person perspective and the writing is clear, direct, and concise.  The action scenes and descriptions in this novel are razor-sharp.  The reader never has any difficulty understanding precisely what is going on in this novel.  There are many unexpected twists and turns in this one, and I will not give anything away.  While this novel is said to have originally been targeted towards \\"young adults\\" in my opinion this one will please the most sophisticated reader.  In point of fact this is one of the better fiction novels that I have read in the last ten years, which is high praise indeed.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
0525478817|5.0|I read this book while in waiting room for my son therapy sessions. I cried. No, correction, I bawled. The secretary lady looked at me like,\\" What is wrong with that girl!\\" Umm, whats wrong with me is that I just read the most epic story ever!<br /><br />When I started this book I expected many things. Death, love, new adventures, but never did I think that this book will take me where it did. It took my heart, star-crossed lovers, and an impending death mixed it all together leaving me in a puddle of my tears. What gets me is how everything is so unexpected. I mean you expected it, but you never think that it will go the way it goes.<br /><br />The love in the book is so pure. It's a love that is cherished with every moment that they have. They don't waste time or beat around the bush. They take every single minute, slowly, carefully, entwining whatever time they have left.<br /><br />The ending. Geesh! This is the part that crush me to pieces. The letter at the end is so brutally honest, so loving, so freaking epic, that I sobbed in that waiting chair. I could not, for the life of me, hold in my tears. Mr. John Green, for you to write such an divine, life changing book, it makes me see things differently. That, \\"What a slut time is. She screws everybody.\\" True. So freaking true.<br /><br />Take my word for it and read this book. After reading this book, you will learn to appreciate the time you have, even if its short. The Fault In Our Stars leads the reader to a vulnerability that they do not see coming. The reader falls prey to the amazing writing of John Green, leading them to a story that will single-handedly break you down. Want an epic story that will blow your mind, read The Fault In Our Stars.

B0063TX06I|2.0|Tony Manero be damned, Main Course is one of many artistic high water marks for the Brothers Gibb that easily equal or surpass their Saturday Night Fever explosion, offering a dense and diverse palate of rich harmony and even richer song-craft - making Rhino's handling of this re-release uncharacteristically short-sighted and an object lesson in marketing and engineering malpractice.<br /><br />Rhino's senseless indifference to sound quality needlessly undermines a seminal, underappreciated record by electing to deny a long overdue remastering. Why buy the rights to the title just to be bad stewards?<br /><br />I have records remastered off of old 78 rpm cylinders that sound cleaner and more resonant than this much younger recording. You would have thought that with seventeen years to improve on the sonics of the original cd release, Rhino could have, should have gotten around to it.<br /><br />Regrettably, it's buyer beware for a personal favorite that deserves better.

B007N0REX6|5.0|Really good album from slash & some great guitar playing. I knew going into this that it would be very hard to beat the last album just because it was so good. The last album is more like a Slash & friends album. With there being so many different singers on the album the music changed from song to song to fit with what the singers could do. It gave a feel like you were listening to a rock station with so many great singers on it that are being played on rock radio right now. This is a different beast. This is a band album and this is like a new Slash band. The album is very good. Slash is really playing great. He has a few years of touring back under his belt and it shows that he is not taking breaks and is back in the flow of playing everyday. Best guitar work & tone Slash has had since the Use your illusion albums.Great cd as a band album. It's better then Velvet Revoler was in every way. The bonus tracks are even great songs. It's more of a Guns n Roses album then you have with Axl Roses new fake Guns n Roses/The Axl Rose Band! Slash is not out to make money. The man just wants to have fun & play for us fans & i'm one of them & i'm so glad he is playing for us again.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|Enjoying the album for almost a week. Have listened to it non-stop and still a lot of fun. The album stands out as a fine example of a mix of electronica, rock and pop.  Reminds me so much of the 90ies and other awesome Garbage creations of that era. There are very few bands that make this kind of music. If it's your thing, go ahead and get it. The whole album is worth buying; I wouldn't split the songs.

Now I can't even give them away.  My advice - read a sample or excerpt first.  If you don't feel nauseous, perhaps these books are for you.
B0057ZEMF2|3.0|Great Concept!  Two of my favorite genres Indian and Flamenco on the same CD with some songs merging the two.  However in comparison to another CD that I bought at the same time, the quality of the Indian music seems leaden and somewhat amateur, something I found a little shocking for the daughter of Ravi Shankar. I would LOVE to hear the Next Gen version of this concept.  I really hope it doesn't end here because Ms. Shankar has demonstrated that Indian and Flamenco music make some of the most beautiful musical children together  :)

B0053O89JM|5.0|I am going to write two reviews. One will be spoiler-free. The other will delve into the final season of this amazing series.<br /><br />Spoiler-free:<br /><br />How do I sum up a show that has influenced me so greatly without giving anything away about the finale, or the episodes that lead up to it? I think the answer lies in House as a character. I have to assume if you are reading the review for the final season of a show that has had eight, that you are at least somewhat familiar with it. I am going to assume that because there is no way to talk about the character as a whole without going over the past seasons. I will not spoil eight at all, but I will talk about seven in this review, and how it ties into eight beautifully.<br /><br />So, here we go. House is as damaged as a character comes. He has tried to find love, with Stacy in season two, and Cuddy in season seven. Some can argue there was even something between he and Cameron in the first season. House is capable of love. He loves more than most do, but in a way that is guarded behind cynicism, sarcasm, and avoidance. He sabotages every relationship. Cuddy made his fears come to life in \\"Bombshells\\", the season seven episode. It ultimately leads to what many call the \\"jump the shark moment\\". House drives his car through her living room. To me it was brilliant, and completely in character.<br /><br />What the season seven finale left were a lot of questions. Many felt like the House they had watched over the years would never have done something so destructive. Season eight had to be about redemption. And my fellow fans, the writers hit it out of the park. He paid the price for the crash. Due to a negotiation fall out Lisa Edelstein's final scene in the show was last season, after House gives her the hair brush back. And, in my opinion, it was the perfect exit for her character. But, that doesn't change the fact that the act of last season made many find House's character had gone too far.<br /><br />Season eight is all about new beginnings, but at the same time falling back into old habits. The first episode is about paying the price for crashing his car into her home. The episodes that follow slowly peel back layers of House we haven't gotten to see before. His redemption comes in paying high prices. The final four episodes of this season are some of the best of the series. The final arc is the one that really challenges House. It makes him show love in a way we knew he was capable, but haven't seen before. To me Wilson has always been the left foot to House's right. So many people talk about Cuddy as House's love. Whatever place she did have, she gave up when she toyed with him. Wilson has always been House's deepest love. They have a friendship that has survived betrayal, (Wilson in season three's, \\"Merry Little Christmas\\") death, (Amber in the season four finale \\"Wilson's Heart\\") and House's countless acts of self destruction. For House, his love is not Stacy, Cameron, or Cuddy. His love is Wilson: A friend that has been there through the worst of it all and hasn't abandoned him. It is completely fitting and fantastic that the last four episodes focus on House and Wilson. And the finale is one of ultimate sacrifice. It is House's redemption, and ends this series in the best way possible.<br /><br />Spoiler review:<br /><br />This is for those who have watched the whole final season, the finale and all.<br /><br />Let's begin. The price House pays for the car crash is a year of prison. The episode does a wonderful job of setting the stage for what the final season will be. He has paid his price, and now is released under Foreman's watch on parole. House's office has been shut down, and turned into a whole other ward. Foreman is now dean. Two new doctors join his team. Throughout the season, House slowly earns his office back. His team is Chase, Taub, Park, and Adams. It's about rebuilding. Season eight has a first season feel, and I love it. I feel like we now know what Wilson talks about in the first season: House pining over Stacy for five years; us meeting him as he starts to pick himself back up again. Wilson talks about how he was there when House got really bad. I feel like the seven seasons were us watching him slowly get back to that dark dark place that Wilson talks about in the first season. And so it is very fitting that the final season is about him starting over again. We have come full circle, and season eight is the only place House could have ended. Because, this time, he changes himself.<br /><br />The final arc was beyond brilliant. It was heartbreaking in its irony and eye opening on so many levels. Wilson has cancer. Not like Cuddy last season where it was a close call. He has a stage 2 thymoma that has invaded the tissue around his thymus. There's a seventy five percent chance of beating it, which also means there's a twenty five percent chance of not. The final four episodes are about House and Wilson. The arc starts with a radical treatment that doesn't work, until it soon becomes about accepting the final five months House has with his best friend. In the penultimate episode \\"Holding On\\", a small prank from House becomes his downfall. As he has begun to accept that he has five months left with Wilson, the small prank comes back to bite him. He has to go back to jail for six months; Wilson only has five to live. I entered the series finale feeling a sense of dread. After all, its titled \\"Everybody Dies\\", and there is absolute truth in it. But, the finale was the most fitting one I can dream up. Kutner, Amber, Stacy, and Cameron all came back as different parts of his subconscious, convincing him that there was more to him than the medicine, or his friendship with Wilson. Convincing him that he'll be okay even when his friend is gone. It was incredible. I used to think the only way for House to end would be for him to die. And he did, but not the man, the identity of House. He faked his own death, destroying any chance of practicing medicine again, just so he can spend Wilson's last five months with him.<br /><br />You wanted redemption. There it is. And in a scene I never thought I would see, House and Wilson ride off on motorcycles, starting their last five months together. It's as happy of an ending that a show like House can have. In his own way, House did get to ride off into the sunset. Amazing. Inspired. Incredible. There will never be another show like House.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved the idea of putting Sherlock Holmes in modern day London.  I like the fact that Cumberbatch has added a hint of sexiness to his character. I love the fact that Watson is an Army medical doctor who was in Iraq and sufferes from PTSD. I love the relationship between these two men - which is a true, abiding friendship. I love the acting, especially from Cumberbatch and Freeman.<br /><br />Having said that, I can understand why some people would not like this series. I do find it difficult to follow at times. For example, in 'A Scandal in Belgravia' I completely missed the part where Irene declares she is gay.  The ending in this one had me confused too, I assumed that somehow Sherlock saved Irene from beheading, but I am not sure how.  Sometimes things (like facts) get jumbled up in my head. Scenes run into one another. It can be frustrating. But for me, the series as a whole is still worth viewing.<br /><br />I am fortunate in that I have never read the original books, so I don't have any other<br />prejudices getting in the way of enjoying this adaptation.<br /><br />This series is very cutting-edge. It is not for everyone. But I do think it's worth watching one or two episodes to see if you like it or not. I will continue to enjoy Sherlock.  And it looks like I'll have to get the DVDs too, as I have learned from the reviews that I was cheated out of eight minutes here in the U.S.!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Much more to this game versus other games I have got for the same price. The other games I finish in an hour this 1 took several hours :) this game had a lot more tasks and goals which made for much more game play compared to others.
0307949486|5.0|I am amazed by the way Larsson crammed so many different themes into one book and tied it all together in a coherent way. Here are the topics that I counted:<br /><br />1. lifestyles of the ultra-rich<br />2. counter culture<br />3. mental health<br />4. violence against women<br />5. journalistic integrity<br />6. family dynamics<br />7. guardianship/care of mentally unstable individuals<br />8. computer hacking<br />9. book of Leviticus<br />10. corporate malfeasance<br /><br />Larsson did a fantastic job of weaving these topics together with a compelling group of characters.  Its definiately a book to read. I only wish that Larsson was still around to write more books like \\"The Girl\\" series!
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I'm surprised there are 757 reviews and the overall is 4.5 stars? That seems crazy. There were actually typos in the book.  The main character is a VERY dramatic college girl, but I got a more immature high school vibe from the book. It is very cheesy, with the typical \\"bad boy\\" beating up people for looking at \\"his girl\\" the wrong way. I usually like books that are an easy read, but this was just downright corny. Save your time and money.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.. I couldn't put it down. Was glad I ordered all 3 of the books at the same time, when I was done with 1 I went right into 2, when I was done with 2 right into 3. I really liked that it gave background into Christian Grey!!!! :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game!! I only wish there was an option to play with the computer or something...I don't like waiting on my friends to respond. I want to keep playing! Its totally entertaining!
B003R17BV0|5.0|Based upon a true story, this was a very entertaining movie with a feel good, uplifting storyline.  Love, action, drama, overcoming the odds, and well acted, there's something for the guys and gals to enjoy.  I rented this from Amazon Prime, and the quality was really good in HD.  It made for an enjoyable evening at home and well worth the time spent.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Toby is a former CIA agent, who has been out of the loop for ten years, but suddenly appears. Matthew is a young CIA agent, who is trying to make a name for himself, and is stationed in a safe house in South Africa. The bad guys go after Toby, and he is brought to the safe house. The drama begins, the action is explosive, and the good guys are on the run. Highly recommended for action, drama, and thriller lovers. There is never a dull moment as we view car chases, shootings, brutal fighting, and politics of the spy world. Denzel Washington is outstanding in his superb performance as usual in a riveting story that makes you sit on the edge of your seat.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|In my opinion, this book is a must read for all married or committed couples.  It really helps communication between partners that might not always understand one another. It has made a real difference in my relationship and I highly recommend this book.
098478280X|5.0|Computer Science graduates recommend to me this book, saying that it is a must-have before I go to a coding interview.<br />Also, customer service is excellent, so do not hesitate to buy.
0345803485|5.0|I am so glad that I listened to a friend and ordered these books. I couldn't put it down (not much got done at home).... :) Glad I ordered all 3 so I didn't have to wait to get to #2 and #3. I highly recommend this Trilogy to EvERYONE!!!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Ok ... so Fifty Shades of Grey ... where to start. I picked this book up as I was seeing it everywhere and I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Honestly, I'm hooked! Why? I'm not fully sure. Ana I just couldn't connect with, at all - well not until the very end that is. Christian is completely screwed up. But even still, I completely fell for him. And Christian is the reason I liked ... no loved this book. I'm not going to go into my feelings on the writing style as a whole, because I don't want to pass judgement on anyone. Sure, I found the first few chapters a little slow to get into, but then after that I was flying with it. It warranted a five star from me, so it's certainly done something right. Will I read the next book - with that ending - YES!<br /><br />I know there are mixed feelings about Fifty Shades across the board, but for me a good book should take you ... no steal you, throw you up in the air and land you back down to earth with a bump. This book did that. So for me it was fantastic read and I thank E.L. James for letting me in her imagination. It certainly spiced up the last few days for me!
B004SDEP38|2.0|Build 1277 was released in Google Play on April 30, 2012.  After almost a month, the version in the Amazon Appstore has yet to be updated.  I like this app but it's entirely too annoying to keep seeing it as updatable in Google Play.  I'll update my review when the the update is available in the Amazon Appstore (and downgrade it along with uninstalling it if it doesn't happen soon).
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I was lucky enough to be in the UK when season 2 aired over the Christmas holiday. Now I'm so pleased I can watch it again in the US. The show was the highlight of Christmas telly for me. I'd watched the first season many times and was certainly was not disappointed with series two. The Blue-Ray is superb qaulity. Not much on offer as extras though. Less than the season One Blue-Ray. The Sherlock docu is quite short. Of course, one of the highlights of season One's Blue-Ray was the unaired pilot. Anyway, the the three episodes in season two are wonderful. This is British TV at it's best. Wonderful stuff. Now Sherlock has been set in the 21st Century, I hope the writers will let Sherlock and John get a civil partnership because it's so obvious they are in love. John Watson makes a good put upon wife!
B00782O7IY|4.0|This movie really goes against the grain for a contemporary movie. It is nearly devoid of special effects, the story has a simple narrative, it is shot in glorious black and white, and there is no dialogue save for title cards that splash across the screen periodically. Despite all of this I really liked this movie. However, I like old silent movies and watch them on TCM quite often. I don't know if everyone would like this movie, but if you have watched silent movies in the past and like them this movie might be for you.<br />The plot is fairly simple. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a romantic lead and the toast of Hollywood and Peppy Miller (Berniece Bejo) is a movie fan/wannabe film ingenue. Their paths keep crossing as the two experience the high and lows of fame. There is a connection there, but they keep colliding with one another as George's career falls apart and Peppy's  is on the rise. George represents the old Hollywood and Peppy the new which includes the advent of sound. The plot incorporates elements of Singing In The Rain and A Star Is Born.<br />I think this movie works because Dujardin and Bejo are two really appealing actors who act with their faces and have mastered the art of pantomime. The supporting cast is first rate. Penelope Ann Miller appears as George's shrewish wife. While no words are heard, she milks her part for what it is worth. John Goodman is great as the boisterous movie mogul who ultimately controls George's fortunes. James Cromwell plays George's chauffeur who really is more friend than chauffeur and looks after George when things get really bleak. The part of \\"The Dog\\" is played by a non-descript terrier named Uggie  who is a cross between Rin Tin Tin and Toto who is part savior and 100% man's best friend. The script is straight forward and amusing and endearing enough to get the viewer invested in the film. I knew the film was good when I stopped being conscious of reading the subtitles. I'm certain that early moviegoers did exactly this before sound movies were introduced.<br />On the face of it, the people who made this movie did something gutsy when they made this movie. Reverting to silent film doesn't seem like the smartest move.<br />I don't think we'll be seeing more silent films made for today's audience, but I enjoyed this one.d exactly this before sound movies were introduced.<br />On the face of it, the people who made this movie did something gutsy when they made this movie.

B0051GOB26|3.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  As for this specific incarnation of it... I wanted to upgrade to HD and was hoping to have both BluRay and HD Digital Copy.  The product description doesn't specify (and couldn't tell from looking at a store), so I emailed NBC-Universal customer service and was told that yes, the Digital Copy is HD.  After buying the BluRay, I was disappointed to find out that the Digital Copy is NOT HD after all.  I replied to NBC-U customer service, but they just pointed the finger at the 3rd party company that handles the Digital Copies.  So, unless you really want the BluRay, you can just get the HD version on iTunes for $5 less.
0345803493|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. When I was finished I went right into book 3. Recommended this to many friends to read!!!
B007SGM084|1.0|I'm so glad I didn't pay for this! Received the trilogy as a gift and I hope the gift giver never asks for my opinion on the story. I was so underwhelmed! It's beginner's BDSM *yawn* and the story totally could have been consolidated into one book (no longer than 300 pages if you want to be generous). I was bored and frustrated about 70% of the time; the interaction between the 2 main characters were stale and the sex scenes made me feel numb and empty, but I was determined to finish the books! I really wanted to know if the main character, Anastasia, eventually grows a personality (spoiler alert: she doesn't!) The one thing that bothered me the most was that she says \\"Oh my...\\" at least every other page and each time she does, I hear George Takei's voice in my head.
B00009P1O2|5.0|This concert is truly magic. We will never see the likes of this again. The music,the showmanship,the atmosphere were amazing. I believe all lovers of music should get this DVD, to see how a concert should be done. It is so professionally crafted and one that encompassed the entire stadium.<br />I have four copies in case I wear them out. This concert took place in 1986 and I have never seen anything like it since.<br />Its so sad Freddie died as I believe he had so much to give the world.<br />Great work Queen, you were and are the best.
B004132I20|5.0|This series is an amazing spin of the world of Sherlock Holmes. This Sherlock uses contemporary tools to solve his crimes but still uses his intellect to unravel the threads of the case to create a picture that only he can see. The use of \\"subtitles\\"(for lack of a better word)to infer what is going through his head is nothing short of genius in my opinion.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching this series if you enjoy a good murder/mystery with a lot of wit and a gritty backdrop in London. Watson provides a great source of calm in the face of the tremendous energy that Holmes displays. His opinions carry great weight with Sherlock and he can rein him in when he's gone too far.<br /><br />This series is a refreshing change from the sensationalism of reality TV. Great plots, great acting, a fantastic meshing of the world of Sherlock Holmes that meets our fast paced world filled with gadgets that creates a wonderful series.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This movie is great! Action packed and exciting until the end. Loved in the theater and love on bluray. A movie I can watch more than one or sure

B000VNMMQG|4.0|Wilbur Wilberforce spent 20 years of his life working against the slave trade; this crusade cost him dearly with ill health and political suicide.  In the end, as with all things God has his hand on, England abolished the policy of slave trade and Wilberforce's name went down in history.  This triumph over a shameful business practice eventually crossed the waters to America, and the rest is history.  It is sad that it took so long for educated men to realize that each person is equal in God's sight.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|I loved this history of Queen. What an interesting insight into this amazing band. Right through to the final days of lead singer, the charismatic Freddie Mercury. All Queen fans will love this and is a great addition to your library.<br />Long live Queen
B00003CXCW|2.0|I guess we're supposed to judge a film by how well it achieves what it sets out to do, and based on that, this film is a success. However: For me it is depressing, with little redeeming value. *Spoiler Alert*... The most likeable character is killed off at the end by the very unlikeable aging star (and it's her personality, not age, that is the problem); it's an innovative ending, but not a satisfying one, IMHO. This film achieves \\"creepy\\" very well, but cast an unpleasant shadow over my evening.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is a good quality controller. I have dropped it on many occasions on accident and it still works perfectly fine. Durable and reliable.
B0007939NO|1.0|This is one of my first Gene Kelley movies. I'm not a huge fan. He seems alright, but everything seems formulaic, and by the second or third movie it all starts running together. My mom said, wow, \\"Gene Kelley really let himself go.\\" I had to laugh. I don't even know these actors but, \\"Mom, I think Gene Kelley is the other one.\\" Poor Van Johnson.<br />Singing, dancing, all fine. That's what the point is, right? No one's looking for holes or just plain stupidity in the storyline. Those aren't important.<br />The music is memorable, I've even heard a couple of the songs somehow, and now I know where they came from. Some are infectious, that's either good or bad. I probably looked dumb walking around singing, \\"I'll go home with Bonnie Jean\\" for the week or two after watching this.<br />There are some issues with the point of the story. Man, woman, magic disappearing town, cursed/blessed to wake one day every 100 years. What's that mean? It sleeps for the other thirty six thousand four hundred and ninety nine. 36499 days of sleep! Seriously? How romantic. They might as well be corpses, or weird zombies that wake every century. Who cares? They have no impact on the world, and vice versa. But that's the point. God saved them from the naughty wicked world. They don't stay to make it better. They don't participate, earn, strive, or suffer like the rest of us mere humans, they hide, and so they are preserved sans formaldehyde. Asleep. For basically, forever.<br />So, one day every hundred years, and they don't age. How do they reproduce? I guess that's not necessary. They also fall asleep at dusk or so, so I guess no one has a love life, or goes to see a movie, at least not at night. If they don't do the dishes before they go to bed they will be dirty for the next 100 years!<br />They will wake up 10 times every millennium and age 10 days. The sun will only last another few billion years. The next time they come back the world may have already ended, all the plants, animals,or oxygen may be gone. But I guess you don't want a real world perspective, you want a happily ever after one. In which case, who on this entire planet would think going to sleep forever was the best thing that could happen to them? Not me. So, one guy wants to get in, one guy wants out. Through brilliant maneuvering, they prevent this cataclysmic action by killing the poor fellow who wants out. That takes care of that. But the fellow wanting in, well he has to stay or he will never be able to come back. But he doesn't stay, regrets it, and gets back anyway.<br />Honestly, for this to be a happily ever after for me, after all their dancing and singing around Brigadoon I was really hoping he'd rescue the poor girl and get her out of her tomb town. But no luck. Let's see, if this were made in 1954, then in 2054 they will wake up and will it be tomorrow for them. Maybe they can talk it over and decide eternal sleep isn't that healthy for them or their relationship and they can make a daring escape. I can't wait till then, if I live so long, to find out what happens in Brigadoon II.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|The women in my family were all RAVING (yes shouty caps-so dumb) about this book, so as an avid reader I thought maybe I was missing out on a great book. The only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't purchase the whole trilogy but just the first book. At the end of it I literally kept on trying to get to another page on my Kindle because I thought that for sure this wasn't all there was to the book? Really? Thats it? okay... Makes me wonder what the hell my family members read if they thought this was a great book. I rate is as okay since I've read worse novels. At least the author made you like these characters, Grey definitely has issues but cares about Ana and Ana is just a likeable character, if naive. My family says that I feel this way because I only read book one. Well, the way I see it book 1 wasn't good enough for me to waste my money on book 2. If I HAVE to read the others in order to enjoy the first, then the book isn't good enough to stand on its own. To me that means that book 1 and book 2 should be ONE book. Whatever, I'd be willing to read the second and third installment just to see if my family members (and co-workers) are right but there is no way in hell I'm paying for it. I already wasted $10.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Had to get this to watch the whole thing, I caught the end of it on t.v. It's pretty funny for a spoof, and definitely memorable. It's now our own running joke whenever we talk about zombie movies, bad movies, good movies, or the name Shaun. Or British English. Some things get lost in the translation, those were pretty heavy accents for us to decipher. Probably everyone can relate to the family or dating relationships going on, so get to laugh at themselves. There was also more swearing than I felt necessary, but I've never been in a zombie apocalypse so I can't honestly say how much swearing is enough. Now to watch Dawn of the Dead so I know what they're spoofing.
0307454541|5.0|I must say I was apprehensive when someone first suggested this book to me, as I am not normally one to enjoy mystery novels.  On occasion I come across one that I like, but in general I tend not to go in that direction when choosing a  new novel to sink my teeth in.<br />Suffice to say, Stieg Larsson put me in my place and proved that there are mystery/suspense novels out there that even readers who normally don't turn to those type of books, will enjoy.<br /><br />I guess I need to point out as well that I'm Norwegian, so I am fully able to relate to a lot of the political information, the scenery and the culture described in the book, so in a sense that may have made it a tad bit easier for me to read than the average American.  (No offense at all by the way, it's just that I'm familiar with most of the events he listed in his books, so I could easily follow them).<br />Even for me, however, despite being familiar with a lot of this, some of the political ramblings were a little much at times and I must admit I skimmed through a few of them so I could get back to the core of the story.<br /><br />I loved this book.  Once I got through the initial introductory pages and chapters, I was completely involved in the story and couldn't wait to see what was next.<br />Larsson's characters are fantastic.  I love his descriptions of them, you can completely envision them in your mind and relate to who they are and how they present themselves.  I love how he doesn't let them waver at all from their persona, whenever they get emotional in one way or another, whether it be love, sadness etc, they stay in character.<br /><br />As far as the mystery is concerned, I love how detail oriented Larsson is, I loved the entire process of the detective work involved.  I just thought this is a fabulous mix of the old-time GOOD \\"whodunnit\\" crime books that I did enjoy some of growing up (Agatha Christie, Perry Mason, Derrick (for Europeans out there) etc) and a more modern type of crime book.  The violence is higher, and although I'm not normally one to condone violence in stories, I do recognize the need for it in order to enhance the story, and this is one of those books in which the violence is indeed contributing to the story and it's not just in there because he wanted some action.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book from page 1 to the last. I do however, think it's the kind of book that you either love or can't get through.  The ones of us who make it past the first few pages will enjoy the entire book, but I do have friends who have put the book down after a few pages because it was such a \\"heavy\\" read.<br />The heavy read though, is because of the amount of detail Larsson has put into his descriptions in order to properly set the scene for his novel, so if you can keep this in mind while reading the beginning of the book, you will see that it becomes easier to digest this novel as you move along.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good read, I'd definitely place my bets on this one and like I said, even if mystery isn't normally your thing, I'm fairly sure you will still enjoy this one, just speaking from my own point of view.<br /><br />Lastly, I just want to mention that I'm so sad that this author is no longer alive and cannot produce any more masterpieces.  This book showcases, not only his talent as a writer, but his intellect!  This book was no doubt written by an intelligent man, and I love to read intelligently written literature.<br /><br />Love it. Love it.

B005L38QK2|5.0|This is a very cool looking and is a diablo iii official mouse. The flashing Diablo III logo will get people attention.<br /><br />This mouse has 4 side buttons, 2 left and 2 right. You can able to use all diablo iii move with just mouse no need keyboard, but it will get used to it since the button isn't easy to assesible and might be a bit press the wrong button since they too close each other. The mouse has high DPI and you can custom, problem is the software, the side button are basically useless outside diablo. Wish you can program for other stuff.

B001AQT0RC|3.0|We get it, Carl, you hate God, and everyone who likes him is dumb.<br /><br />Moving on. I can't analyze all the big theories and allegories this movie undoubtedly has. I'll leave that to people who claim to be experts in the fields of space stuff and God stuff. Or movie stuff. I can however say for the moderately inquisitive and curious readers and watchers of sci-fi, who hope that the center of the universe isn't our little marble, and maybe, just maybe, there's room for more people and maybe even a deity out there, that this was a pleasant movie if you can get past all that bile-raising stuff. Sagan wasn't so much as educating the uneducated as bashing and berating those who do not agree with him. I think he had the opposite effect, unless that was his sole intention, to seem small minded and angry. If I make a movie about space, hope, and the future I'll probably try to not degrade over half the people of my planet and fill it full of politics and hate.<br />It kind of makes me think if there were someone else out there they'd watch how we belittle each other (as per this movie) and pass right on by.<br /><br />But it gets an \\"A\\" for effort. I'll take away this part of the movie (unless I made it up myself). The future could use more open minded and enthusiastic hopeful people.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|I watched this movie and I have to admit it was not as I expected.  At times this movie was hard to watch as Dr. Jung is interviewing this young woman Sabina who he ultimately falls in love with and has a long term affair.  I don't think Keira Knightly was believable in this role and I found her accent to be really forced.  I'm just used to seeing her in other roles, I guess, and it was difficult to watch her--she was trying too hard to portray this woman and for me it didn't work.  However I liked Viggo Mortenson in the part of Sigmund Freud--I wouldn't have recognized him and I feel that he pulled it off well.  The positive aspect of watching this film was that it made me want to know more about the characters involved, especially Carl Jung.
0307386171|1.0|After reading \\"Atonement\\" I was so excited to get another book from this author.  I was very disappointed.  The plot was less than intriguing and the content dragged.  The first chapter kept me reading for a bit, but i skipped every other chapter that only prolonged the disappointing and strange outcome of the story.  I definitely wish I had the little amount of time that I spent reading this book back so that I could read something else.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|In this period of divisive and vicious political wrangling, comes a book that teaches us respect and appreciation of true patriots.  Most of our ex-presidents became friends and worked together for the common good. In this day and age, truly a remarkable feat. Wish our Representatives and Senators would read it--especially those who are adverse to  any sensible solutions!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is the first review that I've done so please bear with me. I'm fat...so in the attempt to lose weight and get in shape I've attempted to read and research quite a bit. This is the first book that I've read that seems to cut out distractions and just give quality information on how to approach building a better body. That is a refreshing change of pace from all the other products tat I've seen. On top of that, I've exchanged e-mails with the author; asking specific questions. He responds quickly and seems genuinely interested in helping and providing good info. That is priceless in my opinion.

B00846WWVM|5.0|Similar to angry birds in that you have to aim and shoot, but this is more of a puzzler. VERY fun and definitely worth the price! There 's a reason why iPhone fans went nuts over this!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book is so inspiring to me! I've started to slowly run and build up my stamina again, very happy with this purchase!
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|The book is full of twists and surprises. Jeffery Archer is a such talented story teller that the readers are totally immersed in the story.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have passed this book around my whole family.  It is truly an awesome book and I recommend it highly.  I had a difficult time laying this book down after I started it.  It will keep you on the edge of your chair every minute.  These young men do awesome things every day that we never hear about.  This will certainly help you to appreciate our troops more, especially the Seal Teams and Green Beret.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Its a good game on my kindle fire but hard to get out of the game that's why I gave it four stars
B0071MV540|3.0|This movie was fun, but it fell apart in the end because the plot was so poorly constructed. On the other hand, the cast is great -- particularly Eddie Murphy and Alan Alda. I agree with other reviewers that it is an okay rental but not something you'd need to buy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read a book that has created more discussion amongst women of all ages.  I'm 50+ and my 20+ nieces are reading it, my 60/70 old friends are reading it.  It's awkward to bring it up but eventually we realize we all are enthralled by it.  Maybe because the subject is outside of the norm it facinates us. It definately is thought provoking as you try to understand each of these characters and how they deal with their differences.  With most things in life - compromise is a key.  It could certainly bring a little spice to some otherwise boring relationships out there, that is for sure. I just finished the 2nd one and I'm on to the 3rd.  I hope it's a happy ending.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy!!!  I was so sad when I realized I was done reading them so I decided to read them again.  I was memorized by Christian and Ana's relationship.  The depth of their love is unbelievable as it pulls him out of all his traumatic childhood issues.  Don't be shy by their trysts, but look past them and see the beautiful love story that enfolds Christian and Ana!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its great for kids my son loves it there's no Mario games so this is a close as I gets
B004I8WD6E|5.0|So many cases out there are bulky.  This one doesnt add much bulk and does a fabulous job protecting my iPhone!  Dropped it down a few cement steps accidentally with zero damage.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|ok so I love this game a lot but recently it stopped working everytime I try to get on the screen turns black and it turns off! :( I'm really disappointed  but hopefully omgpop can fix it. if it worked I would give it a 5 star
B003L77GGK|5.0|This is the best show ever...I bought as a gift for my best friend and she said she loved it, then I watched and i was hooked on the first episode...Now me and my boyfriend watch it...I on the third season and everytime i watch an episode it keeps getting better and better... Great show.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Only had this app for a day but I'm in love! Thank u for providing this. Only thing I ask is create a way to drag notes from books on kindle fire
0375869026|5.0|This is one of those books where I started reading and couldn't stop until I finished the book.  I had plans for the day that I kept pushing back, because at every chapter's end, I would tell myself I was going to stop, only to say, \\"one more chapter.\\"  I had joyful tears and some tears of sadness.  As someone who works with special needs children, I could really identify with this book.  But I think anyone can relate to this book, and would highly recommend it to all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although not a particular fan of this genre, the story  and it's characters pulled me in. I became transfixed on how the story would end. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of \\"Twilight\\" as there are dome similarities-- which the author readily admits to basing the story on.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|when I was about to buy something it took my gems so be careful when you try to buy something and look carefully
B005D0RDKW|5.0|If you are a Rush fan, you will love this concert. They put on a great performance for almost 3 hours. I recieved the blu-ray version of this concert and it is fabulous. Crystal clear picture and rich sound. A must see for sure.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this one but I have to say, it was fantastic.  I laughed out loud several times.  Emma Stone was great but even better were her parents.  Great, great movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a really beautiful book.  I was the slightest bit disappointed in the ending, because I didn't feel as if I got enough closure.  But otherwise, this was an awesome book that really resonated with me.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very enjoyable. I love the auto complete as well as that everythingmoves quickly and is not at all sluggissh. I am using the freebie version so I do get tired of all the ads. Other than that, I Love it!!
B005ZUR724|2.0|I really liked this game at first. Running through the landscape works well on the Fire. There are a fair number of glitched quests; but that was workable.<br />However after the last update the Fire version no longer works. For that reason this game gets a poor review. It has been broken one week, and they are aware of the problem, supposedly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|enjoyed playing for hours cool graphics and animations just maybe a few more options like change or customize background and deck of cards
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and outgoing but it also is fun to play on long trips and vacations and if your pregnant and in the house alot
0307730697|5.0|If you've spent much time reading the Old Testament, you'll remember that it's a story of a people who are chosen by God, who promise to be faithful to God, who forget their promises, and eventually return to the God who never gave up on them. You might also remember that there are a lot of things in the Old Testament that just couldn't have happened. That is, they couldn't have happened without help - a lot of help. Maybe a better way of putting it would be that God orchestrated some of these situations so that it would be obvious that He was in charge, that this wasn't something that human beings could do on their own.    Reading \\"FEARLESS\\" ( Eric Blehm, WaterBrook Press, 2012) reminded me a lot of the flow of the Old Testament, along with some similarities to the parable of the Prodigal Son. Promises made, promises broken, things that couldn't have happened without God's help, but God was there, helping, and waiting patiently for the prodigal to come home. And Adam Brown did return.    This is the story of Adam Brown's journey to become a member of an elite team: SEAL Team SIX. Along the way there were lots of obstacles; as his faith and family, along with a lot of prayer, helped him to overcome those obstacles, God was at work doing the humanly impossible.    A history of drugs and arrests didn't keep him from his goal, even though the military has a very low tolerance for that sort of thing -God at work. (The publisher assured me that the accounts of drug abuse and arrests had been verified.)A couple of physical injuries should have kept him from meeting his goal; they didn't - God at work, again.    Although most of us will never be called upon to be the type of hero that Adam Brown was, if more people could learn to face challenges like he did, the world would be a far better place.    This is not just a story about the rigors of becoming and serving as a SEAL, it's a story of how one man was strengthened by his faith and the love of and for his family. It'sa story of overcoming obstacles, pursuing a vision and becoming the person that God wants you become.    And it's a reminder that sometimes things happen in ways that make it clear that this could have only happened with God's help.    Adam Brown made the ultimate sacrifice for his country when he lost his life on a mission in Afghanistan. This book could have been told from the perspective of honoring a hero, but Adam himself wanted the story to include his life before Christ, so that in perspective the reader would have to see that this is a story about honoring God.    Wondering about how to live a Christian lifestyle and move along in your Christian walk? Is drug abuse a part of your history? Are you in the military and scared about this deployment or the next one? (Yeah, scared, deep down even though you don't want to admit it to your friends) FEARLESS may be the book that helps you face those issues head on!    Here are some links provided by the publisher that you can check out    NBC coverage: [...]    Book trailer [...]    WaterBrook News:  [...]    Read the first chapter: [...]    Thanks to the publisher for providing me an advance review copy of this book.(I was not required to write a positive review). Thanks also to the publisher, author and family, for several copies of the book which were donated to the Chapel at the Air Force base in my community.

0525423656|3.0|Cassia Reyes was raised in Oria, under the thumb of a Society that dictates what Citizens eat, who they marry, what they wear, how they make their living, and even when they die.<br /><br />In MATCHED, Cassia is matched with her best friend-the handsome, popular, perfect Xander, and she couldn't be happier. But the next day a second face flashes up on the screen from her match banquet microchip-the face of Ky, an Abberation and acquaintance.<br /><br />Cassia is left to wonder if it was a mistake, but the thing is, the Society doesn't make mistakes.<br /><br />Or do they?<br /><br />In CROSSED, Cassia decides to spend her summer vacation in the work camps of the outer provinces in search of Ky. Meanwhile, Ky is literally fighting for his life and trying to find a way back to Cassia, who he presumes is still in Oria. Both make new friends along the way, and have to bargain, trade and escape in order to find each other. Oh and as with the first book, there is lots and lots of poetry, or rather pieces of the same poems recited over and over again in an annoying fashion.<br /><br />CROSSED is told in alternating first person chapters from Ky and Cassia's POV. While I do not mind this format, Condie did not distinguish the character's voices well enough from each other, which made it confusing at times.<br /><br />Other reviewers have likened Cassia's dystopian Society to THE GIVER (which I have not yet read), as well as to THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy (which is far more dangerous and suspenseful than the Matched trilogy). I was reminded of Lauren Oliver's DELIRUIM, which I highly recommend (five wing rating).<br /><br />All in all I give both MATCHED and CROSSED three-wing ratings, and will read the final book in the series, REACHED only to find out how it ends, but am in no big rush to do so. CROSSED was more of a \\"bridge\\" book than anything, with little suspense.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on www(dot)faeriewriter(dot)com
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed these stories. I could hardly put it down. Wish I would have just bought the triology to begin with because I had to get to the next series as soon as I was done with one.
B005CAAVVQ|4.0|This is a great second cd just as good as the first.  Lenny Kravitz's influence is very apparent.  The addition of female vocals is great.  Well worth the buy.
0801896940|5.0|A delightful gem which is a model of physics instruction.<br />The writing is lucid, crisp, even friendly: the mathematics lucidly presented to complement the physics concepts.<br />The author exudes a passion for the subject which translates into a wonderful learning experience.<br />One goal: to allow the reader entree into the relationship between symmetries and conservation laws.<br />Preface: &#34;...Noether's Theorem deserves to be more widely known among Physics students, including<br />undergraduate physicists, than is presently the case. This book attempts to fill that need.&#34;<br />(Which need this book does, indeed, fulfill !).<br />The textual material is suffused with an historical enlivening and interwoven with questions for<br />reflection and discussion, followed by ample exercises enabling the reader to test understanding.<br />(Note: The book emphasizes Physics; historical and mathematical niceties will need to be sought elsewhere !).<br />Accessible to senior undergraduate physics students (familiarity with Mechanics,Electrodynamics,Quantum Mechanics).<br />Four Parts delineate the text: Functionals, Invariants, Fields, Post-Noether.<br />Nine Chapters include: Lagrangians, Hamiltonians, Gauge Invariance, Electrodynamics, Quantum Mechanics.<br />(1) D'Alembert's Principle : &#34; From this sample review we can appreciate how Hamilton's Principle<br />grew out of a tradition of  looking for a foundation of mechanics that could be expressed in the language of<br />variational principles.&#34; (Pages 44-47, A nice interlude discusses &#34;Why Kinetic minus Potential Energy ? &#34;).<br />(2) &#34;Perhaps we can distinguish matters of principle from what is detectable,&#34; which statement serves<br />as prelude to an elementary discussion of invariance under infinitesimal transformations (Page 62).<br />(3) Inverse Problem: presents the option &#34; given a Lagrangian, to seek transformations that lead to invariance.&#34;<br />(4) &#34;But, Quantum Mechanics finds complex numbers compelling. The existence of the tunneling effect illustrates why.&#34;<br />A statement  nicely elucidated in subsequent discussion (Pages 110-113) preceding elaboration of Gauge Theory.<br />(5) &#34;In a general physics course, when you chose to set the gravitational potential energy to be zero at the base<br />of the roller coaster track,you were using gauge invariance.&#34; (Page 130).<br />(6) &#34;So, local gauge invariance requires the photon to be exactly massless; but, to turn this into real science,<br />what is the measured value of the photon mass? &#34;(Page 140);<br />there follows a beautiful exposition regarding Electrodynamics as a gauge theory.<br />(7) &#34;Why should we care about Internal Degrees of Freedom ?&#34;<br />there follows discussion of Kaons and two-state systems, described in elementary fashion (Pages 145-148).<br />(8) One Problem  asks the student to &#34;explore the context in which General Relativity is a gauge theory&#34; (Page 166).<br />This is a four-part  (a-d) problem concluding with &#34;list analogies and differences between the procedure just outlined<br />and the gauge transformation for Electrodynamics.&#34; (An excellent pedagogic device !).<br />(9) A brief, elementary,discussion of Hamilton-Jacobi Theory is also supplemented by interesting Exercises for the reader.<br />One multi-step problem involves the method of isoclines in the solution of differential equations (Problem 8.4, Pages 187-189).<br />(10) The final line of the text invites you to &#34; find out whatever you can about the Feynman Path Integral (Page 202).<br />Thus, this book serves as  bridge and foundation stone to more advanced approaches !<br />Appendices briefly review: Tensors, Special Relativity, Legendre Transformations, Jacobians.<br />The book offers a unique blend of classical and modern physics, along with the concomitant mathematics,<br />presented at a level not too advanced nor too elementary; Readilyaccessible to its target audience.<br />Highly and Warmly Recommended to all students of physics.<br /><br />Addendum: The book is reviewed in the pages of Physics Today (September 2011, page 62).<br />As mentioned in that review there are misprints and  historical inaccuracies promulgated<br />in the book.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Installation:<br /><br />Installation was a little confusing and took about 20 minutes. Other than putting one thing on backwards (my fault) there really wasn't an issue until I had to screw the heatsink into place. Even with the fans removed, it can be a little frustrating to screw in some of the bolts. I have large hands so some of this is expected<br /><br />Operation:<br /><br />This thing is a beast. Im running a FX 6100 oc'd to 4.7 GHz with 1.5 V core, temperature has never gotten above 40 C after six hours of Prime 95. Might note, I have have the dual fan option installed, with extensive case fans (6 x 120 mm fans).<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />I was thinking about a pre-built water cooling system and I am more than happy to have picked this. I never wanted to overclock my system to death and I met my goal with this awesome heatsink. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE!
B0071T3Q9K|4.0|It's a well recorded album of standards and standards-sounding well performed songs. You might have to be a McCartney fan to enjoy the entire album all at once but randomize your library and when one of these cuts comes on you won't hate it, you moght even listen to it. It's a good album that I would buy again.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a very cool game I've been playing for a while now. I have many other games by gameloft
1400034779|4.0|I had originally written a much less positive review after reading the first book of this series, but something about it stuck with me and kept me reading the next one...and the next...and so on.  I'm up to the tenth now!  These stories will definitely not be to everyone's taste, but Smith is a highly skilled writer and there really isn't anything else like this series that I've encountered.  They are sweet and lovely, as everyone says, without being condescending to characters or reader.  They're also just plain fun to read, and I've really enjoyed them a lot.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The price point is awesome for the performance it provides. I think if I were to upgrade I would have to go water cooling because I don't think an air solution could do much better than this thing. This hsf is large so make sure it will fit in your case and also make sure that your ram is not too tall. Also be aware that when you first install this product and go into bios that the temps run warmer than they will in windows because of power management features. Mine runs around 41C in bios.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game is great.  Played the Mystery of the Crimson Manor and the Secret of Grisly Manor and then bought this one.  This was more challenging, as someone new to this type of game, and addicting.  As others have said, I didn't want to stop.  Got stuck in some areas, but then finally figured out what to do. The obvious wasn't always so obvious.  Look forward to new products by this company.

B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been a huge, HUGE fan of this band since they released their debut record back in '95. And have loved<br />everything they've released since then (including 2001's experimental \\"Beautiful Garbage\\" which most people seem to hate).<br />Now after a seven year long hiatus we get \\"Not Your Kind Of People\\" which is more a return-to-roots type of record. I'm not gonna break down the album song by song like most people do on here so I'll just make this short and sweet...If you are a huge GARBAGE fan like I am, then this album won't disappoint! It's that good!!! Don't listen to any bad reviews you hear on this site. Take it from me...Shirley sounds amazing, the song writing is amazing and the production is Excellent!<br /><br />This band ROCKS, this album ROCKS, Shirley ROCKS and anyone else who thinks differently, well...<br /><br />Now off to see them play live in NYC tonight!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun to play.  I enjoy getting new levels and finding new games.  I would get this again even if I had to pay for it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was very surprised by this book. Too bad this will be her last books. I guess we will have to wait for the movie.

B0071MV540|5.0|Such a fun movie!  Sure, it's not cinematic genius, but it's super fun!  Definitely worth the $4 rental.  I'll be recommending it to my friends and family!

B007MAETA8|5.0|This is great stuff. I love the acoustic guitar.... Not over produced, you get the real John. Just what I was hoping for. Listen and enjoy! ( Don't ever listen to pro critics!)
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was skeptical about this book at6 first. I saw the American version of the movie first and loved it! I decided to read the novel since usually the book is better and I was not disappointed. The first novel of the trilogy keeps you hooked and coming back for more. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes complex murder mysteries. I am reading the second book (The Girl Who Played with Fire) and I must admit that Larsson does an amazing job setting up the characters and the plot lines needed to progress into the second book. So far, this trilogy is really well crafted and I am sure that if you have a strong enough stomache(there are some really disturbing parrts)you will truly enjoy Larsson's work.<br /><br />As an aside - If you are a teacher and are trying to get your students to learn awesome vocabulary, this book is good for that too although you may need to get parental consent before handing it out.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I read the first book and could not wait to start the second.  Unfortunately I was a little disappointed with the second one after reading the first.  Things happen in this book but are over in several pages so I felt there was never a high point that kept you on the edge of your seat like the first book did.  You find out more about Christian and his fifty shades and the relationships he's had in the past.  Needless to say I'm a sucker for Christian Grey and can not wait to read the third book. Definitely worth reading!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In this book, you may THINK you have it figured out where things are going, yet it'll keep surprising you. There are twists and turns that you won't see coming that will make you flip back pages to reread something to check it out again. Instantly jumped to the top of my favorite books list. Apparently you CAN cut in line. So good I couldn't put it down and read it in under 2.5 days over the weekend.<br /><br />I say redundant since 692 out of 775 reviews (as of 5/23/12) are 5 out of 5 stars. This is just another one, doomed to be lost in the crowd of phenomenal reviews for a phenomenal book.
0345803485|2.0|Like many other reviews written before, I downloaded this book mistakenly based on the assumption that if something is garnering so much attention, it must be worth my time and money, right? Wrong. I just finished the 1st book, and am applauding myself for that, because it was a struggle. The reviews citing the unbearably poor writing skills are 100% true. The author makes NO attempt to hide the fact that this is her very first full-length novel, with her CONSTANT repetitions and lack of creativity. If I have to read about someone \\"murmuring\\" or hearing \\"Holy crap/cow, jeez, oh my, etc, I'm going to lose it. Don't even get me started on the mentions of an 'inner goddess', subconscience, etc. Mind you, these utterances are from a college graduate that is going on 22 years old. I honestly felt like the protagonist - if one can call her that - more closely resembled a 15 year old freshman in high school.<br /><br />The sex scenes were extremely vanilla and repetitive, which I am honestly shocked by. For a book that is apparently being banned in certain parts of the country, there was absolutely nothing graphic about the sex whatsoever. In fact, it's quite immature, with the author calling Ana's genitalia her \\"sex\\", or even better, \\"down THERE\\".. Oh please. Oh, and nevermind the fact that this 'virgin' is suddenly climaxing on every other page. The characters are nearly impossible to relate with, and there lacks a real, tangible plot. The book is plagued with repetition and a lack of subtlety and realism. We get it, he's rich and good looking. There were also several inconsistencies, including the fact that he's presented as an extremely busy man in the beginning, but throughout, he has time to stalk Ana wherever she goes, and reply to emails within 4-5 minutes or less.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of one is because my friend and I read this together, and were able to laugh in unison at the author's lack of talent and completely unbelievable storytelling.<br /><br />The rather 'vanilla' eroticism aims to distract one from the painfully amateur writing. Save your money; don't buy into the hype.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is very challenging. Makes you want to play forever!  I love that there are so many options and that you have to pass one game to open another.
159562015X|3.0|Do you have the opportunity to do what you can do every day - probably not. The author's first book was a best seller in 2001 and this one is just the continuance to that first book called<br /> Now, Discover Your Strengths.  This is just a new and a bit improved version of the first one with an access code for the website.<br />The test shows you not just what your top five strengths are, but also how you rank in the rest of the 34 strengths from Clifton's model.<br /><br />This book includes:<br /><br />StrengthsFinder: The Next Generation (an introduction to strengths and psychology)<br /><br />I: Finding Your Strengths (An overview of strengths  and how the Gallup system works)<br /><br />II: Applying Your Strengths (This second part includes the 34 themes of Clifton's model, what people with that strength look like, and how to manage them, also including ideas for action if you have that strength).<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those readers who are looking for finding out what their strengths are.<br /><br />Warnings and observations:<br />***************************<br /><br />And don't buy a used book - you can't use your test code online if you have a used book and Gallup does not sell new codes for you.<br /><br />Also, the online test is just a basic test - not all the 34 themes included... you need to pay more if you want all of them...So, you probably get more detailed test in some other talent/strength test.<br /><br />Also, this is about the same as the previous book - just a bit newer format. Do you want to pay this much if you have already bought the earlier version.... maybe not...
B003D8KH9A|3.0|I got this for the 103\\" pool and it is so huge, it dips down in the middle and touches the water, so I know if it rains, it's just going to fill with water on top of the cover.  It's so big, there is no way to get it tight.
B005LAIHPY|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #33 : \\" Battleship \\"<br /><br />Hasbro and director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) are on their way to bring another commercial product to life - this one loosely tries to give you the feel of two enemies battling for their survival. There are Aliens from another galaxy battling and a Navel `maneuvers' event (with several nations competing) that turns into a literally \\"battle for the survival planet Earth\\". There really is no reason given, motivation presented or even a hint at why the aliens are doing what their doing - but I guess you are supposed to `go with it'. Okeydokey!<br /><br />With really no true story running through this film, writers Eric Hoeber and Jon Hoeber (Red, Whiteout) tried to develop a relationship with two brothers and an apparently disapproving father-in-law-to-be and make that the emotional core of the film. It just doesn't work for me. A wedding where the groom can't even ask the father permission to marry his daughter - because his is the Admiral of the fleet! More than a little shallow and superficial - the story really becomes interesting in one way - the Battles.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film is the fast action of the aliens, their technology and how the earth sea vessels and aircraft fight this extremely powerful and strong Earth invasion. The special effects and tactical planning of the attacks on both sides is engaging and candy for the eye. Really the movie becomes quite interesting - if completely illogical - when the humans and aliens make their attempts to achieve military control of a communications satellite array in Hawaii.<br /><br />There are some good performances by the two brothers played by Taylor Kitsch (John Carter, X-Men: Origins) and Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood, Straw Dogs) who lead the pack in the adventure that seems forever foreboding. Pop singer Rihanna makes her screen debut in this film and she does quite a good job as a tough, go-getting navel navigator. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List, Taken) does what I call a \\"cameo\\" appearance as the father (and Fleet Admiral) of the love interest and motivating factor for the youngest brother (Kitsch) - Brooklyn Decker (Just Go With It) artfully plays her role with clever wit.<br /><br />Overall...the \\"Grid\\" they use to simulate the original Hasbro BATTLESHIP board game is actually cleverly designed as a plotting coordinates made by ocean buoy's in the see. Of course The end sequence is kind of clever - yet completely non-realistic - but involved the decommissioned USS Missouri in Hawaii. I won't tell you what happens...but it was both patriotic and slightly heartwarming.<br /><br />This is defiantly a film with good action and special effects. There is no meat in the story and really nothing to do but just enjoy the special effects ride. I think kids will enjoy it - past the first half hour...and those that are fans of Navel Military vessels will love this film. Otherwise, it really candy for the eyes and a good thrill ride - did I mention the first 30 minutes? Zzzzzzzz.

B005LAIHHC|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #34 : \\" The Dictator \\"<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohan (Hugo, Borat) pulls no punches when he does his films. They are direct, ironically sarcastic and extremely crass. If you are easily offended by racist comments, political commentary or very color visuals....this film is NOT for you.<br /><br />Larry Charles (Borat, Bruno) directed this film, like he did Sacha's others films with the style of farce, slapstick and extreme visualizations and graphic body parts....yes body parts. (If you have seen Borat, you know what I am talking about.)<br /><br />Screenwriters Sacha Baron Cohen, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer came up with a story that basically puts an abusive dictator in a fish-out-of-water story by having him come to New York to sign a pact (unannounced to him) that will allow his county to sell oil.....he wants to keep it, but his right hand man does not.<br /><br />His right hand man is played by Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List) as secretly back-stabbing second-in-charge who tried to have the Dictator killed several times. - Unsuccessfully, of course. The story is simple and predictable. The action slapstick and visual and you have to look close...there are planted gags, signage and more - especially when you get into the Dictators palace. He is obsessed with bling and himself. It's funny and very visually sharp.<br /><br />The Dictator is eventually kidnapped and `shaved' and becomes like everyone else as his double is put in place in order to over throw his government. One event after another makes his adventure fail almost at every step.<br /><br />I actually enjoy his films and although he is politically incorrect most of the time....I know he's a comedian trying to make me laugh. A lot of people don't like this form of crass comedy - but I wasn't disappointed. In fact, there were several times I was laughing hard out loud and other times I was saying....\\"oh no!...\\", out loud as well. This is like the adult version of Monty Python!<br /><br />There are other performances by some pretty good actors like Anna Ferris (Scary Movie, Cloudy with A Chance Of Meatballs) as his `boss' in a new eco-friendly store that he has to take a job in and survive. She is the one who actually gets him to understand what the `right' thing to do is. Even Megan Fox and Edwaqrd Norton make cameo appearances with film clip archive footage of Hillary Clinton and Obama!<br /><br />Also John C. Reilly (Chicago, Step Brothers) makes an un-credited appearance as the agent who kidnaps the Dictator and gives him his new look!.  Again, if you have a weak threshold for crass (visual) humor and no stomach for political incorrectness...this film is NOT for you. I thought Bruno and Borat were better films overall of this type, but this one did make me laugh out loud!Python!<br /><br />There are other performances by some pretty good actors like Anna Ferris (Scary Movie, Cloudy with A Chance Of Meatballs) as his `boss' in a new eco-friendly store that he has to take a job in and survive.

B007MAETA8|5.0|Well it looks like exile was the best thing for John, and as it turns out, for us as well. If you listen to the interviews that John is doing now, he sounds like he is a lot happier, more at peace, and it definitely shows. You can just tell that he is so proud of these new songs, and he should be. Born and Raised is so enjoyable from start to finish, and I literally cannot listen to it without smiling. It makes me wish I was hanging out on the back porch of his new ranch in Montana, makes me long for the open road, and the beauty of the West. He reaches a whole new level here lyrically and sonically. The guy learned how to play harmonica and pedal steel guitar for Pete sake!<br /><br />Now, I have to be careful not to annoint B&R his greatest work, but honestly, I think before the dust settles, the consensus will be just that. In a world of throw-away pop tunes and empty lyrics, B&R is indispensable. It's relevant and thought-provoking. I like what another reviewer said about \\"peeling away the layers.\\" I think that is right on. You don't get it all after just one listen. There are so many intricacies that require (and will easily provoke) multiple listens. The melodies are so smooth and vital and just darn-right enjoyable! Did I already say that? Not to mention the lyrics. This is Mayer's most honest album. You will probably hear that thrown around a lot, but it's true. I own all of his albums and this one feels the most genuine. He touches on some pretty personal subjects, which really help you connect with the songs. Favorite track: A Face to Call Home. I get so lost in this song. I have to be careful when driving and listening to it because I start bobbing my head so hard I start to swerve. It gives me goosebumps. Favorite line: \\"You know my paper heart, the one I filled with pencil marks? I think I might have gone and inked you in.\\" How heavy is that?<br /><br />Having said all this, Mayer fans might be disappointed. They're too fixated on the Continuum John. It's too bad, because they're missing out on a true masterpiece. To them I say, if you want \\"Continuum-John,\\" listen to Continuum. He's evolving people! Evolve with him, or get left behind. The truth is, Born and Raised is not for everyone. It's not mainstream. Mayer's work here is a far cry from the modern world of hitmakers and manufactured music. It's not hard-charging. What it is is smooth, airy, laid-back, starry-night fun, and that is exactly what we needed from him.<br /><br />Standout tracks: A Face to Call Home, Age of Worry, Walt Grace

B003O86FMW|3.0|I'm very pleased that buying this as a Kindle book, the cost was less if I would purchase it on a local library, but the font is not the best, or \\"reader friendly\\". I don't have a Kindle device, and on my Kindle for PC I can't change it. :(
B003ZHVJFA|2.0|I bought this movie at Movie Stop bc I had finally found it after waiting 2 years for it. The Tekken Movie is another one of those failed adaptions, right there with the Street Fighter movie, and Dragonball Movie. Much better than the Dragonball movie, but probably even with the Street Fighter movie. Complete lack of thought as far as the story is concerned. Not 1 reference to the Devil curse (Which can be excused). Kazuya Mishima has major character flaws. He is too whiny, and not nearly vicious enough to be the real Kazuya Mishima. Plus he has a goatee in this movie (O.O) wtf?! Heihachi Mishima was ok but yet more character flaws. He was a much more honorable man in the movie than he is in the games. In the games he is a bitter old man with a hatred for his son and grandson. Not the case in this movie. Jin Kazama was probably the better part of the movie. The outfits were all spot on, but relevance and character was lacking big time. Jin has a smaller build than he should have had which can also be excused considering it is supposed to be a younger Jin Kazama. You can tell its a low budget film as the entire Anvil part of the movie looks like stage props from a play. The only other issues I care to point out are Christie and Nina. Nina Williams has always been one of the 5 Star fighters in the games. She was always a pain in the ass to beat but Christie disposes of her like she is nothing. Unacceptable. Also Christie is not using Capoera like she, and Eddy Gordo use in the games. Eddy uses it in the movie but not Christie. Beside these great flaws in the movie, it was worth 1 watch but I am going to trade it in a movie stop. If you know nothing about the Tekken story then you will likely enjoy it, the fight scenes are excellent minus the fighting style mishaps. 2 Stars.
0345803493|5.0|Words can not describe how much I love this book. Its a wonderful love story. I would give this book a thousand stars.

B007MAETA8|3.0|I find this one to be bland. It's not bad, just not very good. It is a striped down version of John Mayer. I prefer more production in my music, I guess. Every song sounds the same to me.
B007BVOF8E|3.0|I read some reviews that said this movie develops very slowly, but actually it is positively glacial. I watched it through to the end, but it wasn't easy. I think the book is more interesting, richer in detail and more well-written than the movie. Good actors, though.

0756405890|3.0|I read so many breathless reviews of The Name of the Wind inside the cover that I spent $16 to buy the book without even skimming a few pages.  Now I wish I had rented it at the library, because it was certainly not worth the money or the time.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind certainly aspires to be a grand epic, but is too problematic to warrant that claim.  The story is mostly told in flashback by the protagonist, the sorcerer Kvothe, with some of it taking place in the present.  Its central flaw is the painfully slow and meandering plotting.  Plenty of things happen with little of anything key to the central story arc happening at all, with the exception of a few notable yet short incidents scattered throughout the book.  Kvothe endures an incredibly long series of hardships, triumphs, and more hardships, in a way that seems designed purely to create drama and comes off as self-indulgent.  (A particularly personal gripe is that Kvothe endures so much detailed and repetitive physical trauma that sometimes I felt like I was watching a Mel Gibson movie.)  By the end of The Name of the Wind very little has actually moved forward.  In addition, we are still a long way from understanding how Kvothe came to be the powerful sorcerer that he is for a book that is intended to be a prologue to present-day events.<br /><br />Other complaints include the poor character development of almost everyone but Kvothe himself.  Several of the female characters fall into unintentionally amusing stereotypes, such as the full-breasted co-ed who lusts after Kvothe (Kvothe goes to wizard school) and the mysterious seductress who we are constantly reminded is the mysterious seductress.  The author gets repetitious yet again by attempting to subvert the fantasy genre by actually telling us he is subverting it with phrases like \\"This is not that kind of story\\" or \\"I wish I could tell you this story was like that\\" at the end of several chapters.  The end result, however, is still a fantasy.<br /><br />All of this is unfortunate because the writer is clearly skilled.  Kvothe is an interesting character who lives in a large and ancient world and a lot of potential exists to build quite a story around him, potential that is left unfulfilled after 700 pages of text.
B001PB3NWK|5.0|I purchased both \\"Karol, A Man Who Became Pope and \\"Karol, The Pope, The Man.\\" Both are awesome movies. It kept my attention from beginning to end. If you like Pope John Paul you will not regret purchasing these DVD's!

0345803493|2.0|I forgave Fifty Shades of Grey for being written so poorly because it actually had a plot, but this book just drags on and on with no real action. I'm about a hundred pages from the end, and I don't even care to finish it. Fifty Shades Darker Drinking Game: 1 shot every time the word \\"exquisite\\" is used, 1 shot every time Ana thinks she isn't good enough for Christian, and 2 shots each for every time Ana mentions Christian's \\"twitching palm,\\" or Christian tells Ana to quit biting her lip.<br /><br />Don't waste your time reading past the first book.

B000V1Z8KK|5.0|This movie was a good one to watch.  It remained suspensful throughout the whole movie.  Once again the good guy gets his justice one way or the other. This movie also portrays the great government conspiricies, and how far they take things to cover those conspiricies up.
B005I4JG80|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, mainly because it lacks the fear and judgement that many parenting books load up on new parents.  The whole tone of the book was more of a anecdote of the author's experiences rather than \\"this is how you should do things.\\"  I purposely don't read parenting books because I dislike how they \\"should\\" all over me and purport what often goes against instinct.<br />I definitely didn't agree with everything that the French mothers are doing, however it was refreshing to read that someone else out there believes children should have time to run and play and be children and also to have some autonomy.  I don't think that most of these techniques and beliefs are really anything new or even a method of parenting in themselves; It is more a common sense approach to children as tiny humans.<br />I would highly recommend this book and already have to several friends and family members.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hands down my favourite Kindle purchase so far. In my opinion, the Wool series is written better than many of the best-selling sci-fi books.<br /><br />Wool 1 would have made a fantastic stand-alone story, but things just kept getting better and better. The conclusion, while not happy for everyone, is very satisfying. Hugh, you've done a great job of creating realistic and likable characters. I'm really glad I decided to read this series!<br /><br />When is Hollywood going to pick this story up? They'd be stupid not to.<br /><br />EDIT: Hugh, after reading the couple negative reviews (which suggest that my 5 star review is a fake...hmmm), I've decided to show you (and others) how much I think this story rocks. I'll be buying this again for every family member I recommend this to.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Enjoyed this latest edition to the Mission Impossible movies.  Lots of action and thrills (just as in previous MI movies).  In my opinion it is a \\"buy\\" and one you won't be disappointed with.
6304698623|4.0|This is from Warner Brothers Family Entertainment, and from what I can tell, I'm not certain it was ever in the theaters. There are no famous actors or actresses in it, although Eleanor Bron, who plays the evil headmistress Miss Minchin, looks familiar. This is a beautifully produced adaptation of the original book, which I remember rather better than many others in this cycle of books made into movies. And like the Shirley Temple version, it ends with Sara reunited with the father who was presumed dead in World War I. In the book, as I recall, the kindly old man next door, or rather his son, adopts Sara. But in modern times, unfortunately, this would be taken as too suggestive of child abuse or at least exploitation.<br /><br />So it goes. Literature suffers for the sins of man.<br /><br />Anyway, the stories of India which Sara tells to the other girls are illustrated by the movie, including a \\"Prince Rama\\" who has blue skin. So we are to imply that he is not merely magical, but a god. Sara, of course, knows little of such details. She is relating the stories her nurse told her in India and embellishing them with her fertile imagination.<br /><br />It's a story celebrating imagination, but at one point poor Becky says, \\"This time I think you have gone too far.\\" When you see the movie, you may be inclined to agree with Becky, although nominally there is a material-world explanation for what clearly seems to be some very powerful conjure magic.<br /><br />You should see it, and share it with your kids and grandkids. It deserves four stars.

B005LAIIS0|5.0|This is the first film in a long time that has moved me on such a deep level. I was a police officer, and learned to become somewhat close with death. it was something I knew that may become my fate, and it was something I witnessed happening to those I tried to save. The scene of the man slipping away after the crash brought out emotions that I never knew I had. It was so raw, it immediately took me back to those who left this earth in my presence. Whatever they did, they did it well, and it left me with feelings of inspiration and sorrow.
B00004TJKI|4.0|James Stewart plays just the sort of attorney you would want to represent you if you were accused of murder.  His client, a young and rather arrogant soldier, is not only accused of murder, he admits he shot the guy.  His argument is that there is an \\"unwritten law\\" that justifies the killing.  Gently, his lawyer points out that unwritten law is not relevant in a court of law: only the written kind.  Still, he is willing to take the case mostly because he feels sorry for the young soldier and his rather pretty wife.<br /><br />I've always had a real soft spot in my heart for James Stewart, and for many of the other members of the cast, and it did, after all, get the academy award for best picture of 1959. One bonus is a score by Duke Ellington, who also does a cameo role as a piano player. I'm also fond of stories about lawyers.  So with all my biases, I have to give it four stars.
0345803485|5.0|Real good stuff! Congrats, Ms. James.  I was able to bring back some memories from back in my days. Needless to say, my life was spiced in fifty different ways. Are there any more books like this out there?

0345803485|1.0|This is literature for those with third grade level comprehension skills that only have sex in the missionary position. I've read children's book by Dahl and Sendak with more eloquent vocabulary and development. I have to point out that this isn't my first book in the erotica genre. It seems that the fans have never read Letters to Hustler or Anne Rice's the Taming of Sleeping Beauty series. Seriously, this is tame in comparison and actually reads as silly. Really? This Anastasia girl has never touched her own pu$$y but she's 21? Give me a break. It all reads like Twilight. Same protagonist: helpless ignorant plain Jane meets billionaire (really? not millionaire but billionaire?) strong man that can't resist but dominating her life through the pretense of attraction. Somehow he's managed to learn how to fly a helicopter, play the piano at a masters level,and start his own empire by 26. It's like it was written by a thirteen year old that has a long day dream about getting her cherry popped and writes her fantasy in her pink Hello Kitty journal. Female written misogyny at it's best. Unless someone posts that Anastasia ties this guy up with his own suit ties and smacks him in the ass with her platform stilletoes, I'm not finishing this pos. It's a rewrite of Twilight without the monsters. I read extensively on my kindle and can't believe how poorly written this \\"best seller\\" is. I'm forced by proxy to give one star.<br /><br />Sex books for grown ups: http://www.amazon.com/Claiming-Sleeping-Beauty-Anne-Rice/dp/0452281423/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337717207&sr=8-1
B002GIBVV6|4.0|This is another one of those Warner Brothers Family Entertainment movies, quite good really. You will recognize one actress for sure: Maggie Smith plays the neurotic housekeeper, and she is familiar to many of us as Professor MacGonagall in the Harry Potter series. She's not a bad person, really, just terribly misguided.<br /><br />Anyway, the kids are lovable, although Mary Lenox starts out as a crabby child whose parents never had any time for her before they were killed in an earthquake in India and she was sent to England to her uncle. And, it turns out, her cousin Colin, who also starts out pretty spoiled and throwing temper tantrums. But as they get together, and we learn why he's such a little snot, he turns into a good kid. In the meantime, Dickon the local moor-loving boy who knows all about plants and animals, is a friend and a source of information. He's also somewhat magical, and in fact at one point the kids dance around a fire and \\"perform magic.\\" It works, too; Colin's father (Mary's uncle) gets a sudden urge to return home.<br /><br />It's a pretty story, and you will love the sets, both inside and out, but it's not so complex and well done as A Little Princess, which is by the same author. One of my favorites, Frances Hodgson Burnett, who also wrote Little Lord Fauntleroy and The Lost Prince, which may indeed be her best.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|\\"And how are you this evening, Mrs. Darcy?\\"<br /><br />One of the reasons I started this project of reading the original books from which these movies sprung is so that I can find out whether my favorite bits are in the original. The above line, the last in the movie, I sincerely hope is from the book. It's so perfect. But of course, you have to know how it came to be so perfect, don't you?<br /><br />Keira Knightley is a beautiful woman, a superb actress, and could probably make any role a fine thing. But this is only the beginning. I love period pieces with great costumes and sets, and the old-fashioned dignity of the King's English, and those lush landscapes. And I do love Jane Austen. This movie not only has all that, but some sweet special touches, like Donald Sutherland in a role unlike any he has ever played before, with gentle humor and just exactly what's wanted in the father of five girls.<br /><br />The humor is gentle all through this movie, such as when the two oldest sisters giggle together under the covers over their reactions to the gentlemen at the rustic country ball. The contrast when an elegant upper crust ball is later held so gently illustrates that only those two eldest girls have the kind of class required to be at home in both circles. Yes, their mother is ridiculous, but she loves her girls sincerely, and did not manage to ruin their chances by being rather too obvious in attempting to marry them off.<br /><br />There are difficulties, of course, but the only tragedy comes when the youngest sister proves too eager to be married and runs off with a soldier. Yet rich relations can smooth things over, and she returns to the family a smug married woman, if not exactly a lady.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I regularly use two weather apps: The Weather Channel and Accuweather. I like The Weather Channel better as a mobile app, but the two apps often give slightly different forecasts and I find it helpful to have both pieces of information.  The Weather Channel tends to be more optimistic, Accuweather is more likely to forecast rain.<br /><br />The Weather Channel app is a well designed app that scales to the screen size of your device (I use 7.7 Galaxy tablet), where as Accuweather is designed for a smaller screen of the phone. It does not scale and does not respond to zoom gestures.  Thus the font (grey on black) is hard to read.  The icon for 10 day forecast is not descriptive, located by itself, and was so hard to find that I was about to give up when I accidentally stumbled onto it.<br /><br />I am using both apps on 7.7 Samsung Galaxy Tablet running Android Honeycomb with no technical problems.<br /><br />Overall, I like The Weather Channel app a lot more, but when it really matters I check both.<br /><br />Ali Julia review
B00011D1OA|4.0|Well, we all know the songs, we know the story, it's not new anymore. But somehow that doesn't matter. We've grown up pronouncing \\"The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain,\\" but it's still a delight to see Liza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) get it right at last, and send Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) and Colonel Pickering (Stanley Holloway) into joy unconfined, dancing and playing at bullfights and collapsing in laughter.<br /><br />And of course the embassy ball, where Liza dances with the prince and convinces Zoltan Karpathy (that hairy hound) that she is a Hungarian princess in disguise, is priceless. So is her day at the Ascot races.<br /><br />Perhaps I'm just too jaded, but I can't help thinking about the fact that Rex Harrison puts more into \\"Why Can't A Woman Be More Like a Man\\" and \\"I Shall Never Let a Woman in My Life\\" than he does into \\"I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face.\\" I simply cannot take the concept of romance between Hepburn and Harrison seriously, so I can't take romance between Doolittle and Higgins seriously.  But the music is wonderful (I've memorized the entire score), the costumes and the sets, and Audrey Hepburn is enchanting.
0345803485|5.0|I have one more chapter to go.  The book is hard to put down but I can't sit and read all day long!  Very different than any book I have read before but the characters are very interesting.  I've already ordered the next two books in the series because I have to know how it ends!  What is the secret past of Christian Grey?  That is the big question.  Will he ever allow himself to open up and fall in love?  Will Anastasia ever be able to touch him?  Hopefully this intrigues you to read the book!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Great game, great price. Best adventure/hidden odject app yet. Great value, you get a few hours of gameplay for only a buck. Graphics, story, and atmosphere also great. Hope there is a sequel.

0800141660|5.0|I first saw this film under bizarre circumstances. Friends invited me to their place following a personal tragedy, and as a way to distract me, they played this movie for me on their big-screen DVD player. It did in fact manage to distract me, especially recognizing Snape (Alan Rickman) in the person of Colonel Brandon. Hey, he's a nice guy in this picture!<br /><br />There are no villains, really. There are only people, such as Willoughby, who are pressed by circumstances into being cruel to those who love them. Everyone is very, very civilized, actually, the way only the British can be.<br /><br />No, I take that back: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, the beautiful Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet respectively, have a sister-in-law who is truly evil. But then, she dresses the part, and sounds the part: you can't miss her.<br /><br />Here's a curious fact: Emma Thompson got a Golden Globe AND an academy award, but not for her acting. She also wrote the screenplay. The DVD includes her speech upon acceptance of the Golden Globe, and it is a classic. In it, she acknowledges that they owe it all to Jane Austen, and then asks what Miss Austen would say if she were there. She then read her (Jane Austen's) speech, and it was perfect! It sounded just like her, and was amusing with the dry wit that makes her books so delightful.<br /><br />Anyway, I have no hesitation in giving Sense & Sensibility a full five stars. It is a beautiful movie in all respects. I am especially crazy about the costumes.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I have two boys but bought this set for them anyways.  I actually put away the pink box so they didn't see it was \\"girly\\" and just tossed them in with the rest of the Legos they have.  They enjoy using the colors that come in here and have never commented about them being only for girls.  I think it really livens their huge stock of the basic red/blue/yellow and adds more creative possibilities.  I enjoy playing with these colors more myself too.  And I like when girls come over to play, they are more interested having these colors available to play.  Highly recommend :)
B005GVF95O|4.0|This app does not contain enough puzzles to justify the purchase price, glad we got it for free. At 22 months this was easy for my son, but it did teach him to use the then brand new tablet. Now he is two, but he actually still plays this game sometimes and talks about what the animals eat and say, if they are mamels, etc. So still fun and cute to watch him play, but probably no educational value beyond about 18 to 24 months. Great to have something so easy to learn on though. Could use 2 more pages of puzzles to make it a good value. Would pay a buck for it for a very young one.
B006OB3K56|4.0|The movie is excellent; however, be aware that the digital copy only works with Android devices.  It will not import into iTunes for iPods, iPads or iPhones.  Meanwhile, I've written to Fox and they will not provide any way to download it to your Mac.<br /><br />DRM sucks.
B0006Z2KXE|4.0|The year is 1940. The country is gearing up for war. But you won't find the slightest trace of it in this high society comedy. In fact, the musical remake years later with Grace Kelly in the lead was named \\"High Society.\\"<br /><br />This is Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant and James Stewart, as well as a very clever little 12-year-old whose name I did not catch who played Hepburn's little sister. Just to confuse fantasy and reality, Hepburn's character is named Tracy.<br /><br />There is some very sophisticated comedy here, as you might expect when Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn get together. But James Stewart holds up his end of it, as well. In fact, there are great scenes with two of each of the three players. Mostly while being more inebriated than they are willing to admit.<br /><br />It's pretty light-hearted, but it really is a lovely movie. Maybe not what you'd expect for a country gearing up to fight a war, but I suppose they needed some glitter and some laughs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun. This is a great game to play if you are just sitting on the couch with nothing to do. I can play this game all day, there is such a different variety of games great for all ages

0307949435|5.0|Awesome start if you're looking into the Keto world or low carbing world. Loved every bit of it. Lots of my questions regarding carbs was either answered in this book or I was able to put the pieces together which in the end made sense to me. Although I love carbs, I must do away if I want to reach my goals. Well worth your money!
B0000549B0|5.0|You may not be able to see Harvey, but you will come to believe in him. He's a Pooka, a magical beast in the Celtic tradition, always quite large, and how are you Mr. Wilson. (That's what it said in the dictionary at the hospital when Wilson looked it up.) He's an invisible white rabbit, well over six feet tall, and he's Elwood P. Dowd's best friend. Elwood likes to drink, you see, and Harvey keeps him company down at Charlie's Place.<br /><br />But Elwood's sister and niece don't really like living with Harvey anymore; he interferes with their social life. So Vita, Elwood's sister, decides to have him committed to a mental hospital. It gets more complicated, and extremely funny, after that.<br /><br />Elwood is a very gentle man who has simply given up on facing reality. And he'll give you pause about just what constitutes \\"reality,\\" too, and what it is or is not good for.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Wow.  This is what the Tedeschi/Trucks Band is all about.  If this release doesn't spread the word far and wide about this band-I don't know what will.  Fans who've heard this band live already know-but if you're wondering what all the talk is about-look no further.<br /><br />In this day and age of sound-alike pop/dance music, this band has chosen it's own path-playing the music they love-and it shows.  The rhythm section does what it's supposed to do-push everything along while still coloring the overall sound.  Kofi Burbridge's keyboards, along with his brother's bass work and the band's backbone, their drum sound, is full and expressive yet well thought out.  The soulful horns (especially the trumpet and trombone) aren't merely filler or window dressing.  Their role is to add depth and feeling to the music-which they do.  The vocals too, fit in well.  Mattison and Rivers' harmonies are at times like another instrument.<br /><br />And Susan Tedeschi isn't there just because she's Trucks' wife.  Her fine vocals give the band another instrument  to incorporate into their sound.  And her guitar playing speaks for itself.  Anyone who thinks a woman can't play the guitar in this kind of setting needs to hear this.  Her style both complements and acts as a foil for Trucks slide playing.  And Derek Trucks-whose abilities and feel for the music-surely place him at the top of the list of great slide guitarists.  After a few bars you know you're listening to a master of the guitar.  His solos can be exciting bordering on intense, yet there's also a subtly in his playing.  His tone, his choice of notes and chords, even the spaces and pauses between notes only add to the intensity of his style.<br /><br />And the songs.  Listen to Wonder's \\"Uptight\\", or Fred Neil's (made popular by Nilsson) \\"Everybody's Talkin'\\", the LOVIN' SPOONFUL's \\"Darling Be Home Soon\\", or Bill Withers' (!) tune-all slightly different genres, but all stamped with this band's sound.  Even on the 2003 live set from DTB at the Georgia Theater, they included a cover of \\"Freddie's Dead\\".  Since then the band has refined their approach and sound even further.  Their song choices (along with their playing abilities) are a large part of why this band is so exciting, so interesting and unique, and (yes) so fun to listen to.  Even \\"Wade In the Water\\" has new life breathed into it.  They bend and shape a song into something uniquely their own and infuse it with their own identity.  At times I'm reminded of the GRATEFUL DEAD, who also incorporated songs seemingly outside their boundaries, and stamped them with their own sound.  That and there's a feeling that this music unfolds and happens like it's supposed to do.  No grandstanding, no aimless noodling-everything is aimed at making the best possible music.  The choices of band originals is also very astute.  Playing these songs live has given the band the chance to refine them slightly-which has improved already good songs into something even better.  The small refinements here and there show that the band isn't content to rest on it's laurels-they're always looking at how to improve their music.<br /><br />Fans (especially those who've heard the band live) will have their own favorites.  And if you haven't heard them live, this well chosen collection of songs is truly representative of where the band is now, and (hopefully) gives some indication of where they're heading.  This is exciting, soulful, fun music.  The packaging and booklet contain several good color photos of the band.  And at this low price-it's a steal.  When you get your hands on this set, try listening to it repeatedly over the next few days, and really let this music sink into your musical soul.  It's good for what ails you, and a panacea for all the shiny, thumping, plastic music that seems to be everywhere.  This is a band at the top of their form.  One listen and you'll hear why.e set from DTB at the Georgia Theater, they included a cover of \\"Freddie's Dead\\".  Since then the band has refined their approach and sound even further.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|By FAR, the greatest television series I have ever watched in my life. And I've seen many great tv series over the past 20 years. Nothing compares to how AMAZING this is. There is only one bad thing that comes to mind when I talk about Spartuacus, and that is how much it saddens me that the character spartacus played by Andy Whitfield (RIP) had passed away after this season. I don't think a single person in this world could have played that part any more perfect. I don't even know the guy and it breaks my heart to think of how amazing of a person he was in the show, and how powerful he was with life, courage, pride and integrity, was able to get taken from this world by a rare form of cancer. Guess it shows you that God doesn't play favorites. Nevertheless, watch this series, it'll change your life!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|While surfing Amazon.com last week, I came across this book series and was intrigued by the description.  I read all four books in this series in a week.  I haven't had so much fun reading a series of books since I started the [[ASIN:0451457811 Storm Front (The Dresden Files, Book 1)]].  The story flows straight through to the end of the book, the dialogue is intriguing and funny, and the characters are easy to like.<br /><br />The author took the time to research the mythology and history that is mentioned in the book, as well as many of the places depicted.  To me, that shows a deep respect for his readers.  If he just threw it together it wouldn't feel as real or smooth.  Instead, the story makes sense, is slightly educational, and with all of the surprise battles it's exciting.<br /><br />Atticus, while being over 2100 years old, doesn't think or act like someone who is old.  His character is immersed in modern culture and brings it up all the time.  The best part about it, is he's a science fiction fan as well.  Mentioning topics ranging from Douglas Adams to The Princess Bride and even contemplating introducing himself and a friend as \\"The Doctor and his companion.\\"<br />The best dialogue of all is between Atticus and his wolfhound Oberon.  Oberon says some of the best and funniest lines in the book.<br /><br />Overall, I truly loved this series and I cannot wait for the next installment in the fall.
1118156315|5.0|Like it's cousin, \\"Business Model You\\" asks you to look at your career as a canvas of 9 parts.  This isn't a cookie cutter model, though.  The canvas takes you through 9 parts of a business model that you get to paint.  Painting and canvas aren't loose metaphors here, you can actually paint on the canvas using sticky notes and pictures.  For example, key activities is one of the parts.  What do you do?  Draw a wrench and a beetle, because you fix software bugs, or write down fix software bugs.  The pictures make it more real and tell a better story.  That's what makes painting on the canvas so good, you can tell a better story of what you do, who you do it for, who helps you, who gets benefitted by it, how much it costs, how much you take in.  Highly enjoyable.  Great stories.  Well worth the time.
B0081X40HW|5.0|LOVE IT! Catchy, upbeat, retro, and vocally flattering. She is reaching for the stars and I hope she gets there. Congratulations, Haley!!!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|i only tried 2 tags. one on tv and another from a music clip in YouTube. it worked both times. only if i could have had this app years ago when i was recording instrumental music on cassette tapes. i has a few sings i need to know who they are.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I have just finished this book and i had NO idea what it was about.<br />The first 30 pages or so, i was sure it was for me, but when i thought the romance was kicking off i got interested (love a good love story).<br />When i realised what was going on i was a bit shocked but nothing to bad.<br /><br />The main thing that annoyed me about this book was the author - pretty much everytime Ms Steele said something to anyone the author then had to write, something that Ms Steele was saying in her head, in italics !!! 'oh jeez' being a common thread. This bugs me as i am sure that i along with other who have read this can work out whats going.<br /><br />There is a LOT of sex in this book, but it does nothing.... i feel the author is lacking something when writing the scences, its all a little bit cold despite the heat between Mr Grey and Ms Steele.<br /><br />There are some witty moments in the book, mainly the emails between them.<br />There are some dark thoughts and acts in the book, and i guess we are all dying to know what happened to Mr Grey.<br /><br />On the whole though i have to say i did like the book and i will be reading two and three....
B005HSL626|4.0|I luv this app ssssoooo much but after about a haft a year the app wouldn't open and I don't no what's wrong! now I cant play it anymore! it makes me so sad!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is an excellent movie. I had wanted to see it for months, and I just expected it to be a huge hit. But I always had this little fear in the back of my mind that said it may not do as well as it should, considering Prince of Persia's huge failure, which is a movie I also loved. Then sure enough first weekend $30 million, which if you know the movie business, a movie with a 200 million budget making 30 million is bad, really bad. I kept thinking and hoping for the future of this franchise that it would by some miracle surpass it's budget and do ok. But I was wrong, the next weekend it made even less and less, until The Hunger Games came out to completely diminish any hopes of serious money or any at all for the tale of John Carter of Mars.<br /><br />But what America didn't spend the time or money to find out, was that John Carter happens to be one of the best scifi action adventure movies, one that Disney has ever put out, and two ever made. John Carter has an incredibly captivating story to tell, and has a side romance for any of you women out there. I know right now the chances of John Carter: God of Mars being made are about as good as me going streaking through Harlem. Right, probably not gonna happen, but I guess we can hope and pray, for a sequel not for me streaking. John Carter has an interesting prologue that leads into an excellent adventure on one of the many planets you've probably never been to: Mars.<br /><br />So pick up this movie immediately, because you will never be bored and you'll continuously be asking yourself what life would be like if John Carter hadn't bombed. Who knows you could be rich, or you could be dead. Well it was a thought anyway.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I really loved this game - got thru the first level on my first try.  love the mini games.  but now the first two title screens come up and then a blank screen with the music going.  I hope there is a fix cause I want to go on to the next levels. will give 5 stars once it is fixed.

0439023513|2.0|The Hunger Games series is a prime example of a trilogy that, even though it started off with enormous potential, has gone horribly, terribly wrong.  Sequels, eagerly anticipated though they may be, are often the bane of a truly great story line and, unfortunately, MockingJay is no exception.<br /><br />Where to begin?  The main character, Katniss Everdeen, lacked depth and consistency throughout the first two books, however that fact could be overlooked due to the sheer quality of storytelling.  Not so here, as the underdeveloped and inconsistent protagonist is woefully unequipped to carry a plot that can be best described as labored.  The true art in storytelling is that you do not actually TELL the reader what's happening you SHOW the reader.  MockingJay is plagued by too much TELLING, as the reader is forced to remain on the sidelines because Katniss can't seem to find a way to stay out of the hospital's recovery room.  Katniss should have been there, WE should have been there as the plot unfolded, however the most crucial events of the conflict are summed up to Katniss and the reader in quick concise paragraphs.<br /><br />As I read this book I continuously asked myself what was the author's purpose in writing this book?  Was it to tell the story of a desperate rebellion winning out against all odds? Was is to highlight the inner workings of a teenage girl's mind as she tries to choose between two loves?  Was it to reward the reader for allowing themselves to care about the characters and the poor belabored citizens of Panem?  By all means it should have been some combination of all of those things.  Instead the purpose seemed to be \\"let's just get it over with already\\".  There was not enough material in MockingJay to warrant the 390 pages it comprises, and the author clearly was struggling to bring all of her plot lines to a close whether gracefully or no.<br /><br />While Suzanne Collins is clearly a very talented author, it pains me to say she really under-delivered with this one.elivered with this one.
B004EPYZZ8|4.0|Soul Surfer is a beautiful movie and contains great messages of courage and faith, friendship and family. Parents will be moved to tears. Tween and teen girls will LOVE it and may also be moved to tears. It's not so much a boy movie, however, and although I'm sure some boys have seen it and loved it, I'd recommend saving it for girls-only movie nights and/or sleepovers.

B00005B6C9|5.0|\\"This is Where I Came In\\" will be remembered as The Bee Gees swan song. Beautifully recorded and produced, is simply one very good album. It might be one of their very best ever.<br /><br />1. This Is Where I Came In. 5/5 Stars. This songs starts the album in a very high point. It features a acoustic sound, not done by the band in later years. Very good indeed. It is catchy and sticks in your mind !<br /><br />2. She Keeps On Coming. 5/5 Stars. He tempo and sound are rare for a band like the Bee Gees. A rocker similar to, lets say, the Stones.<br /><br />3. Sacred Trust. 3/5 Stars. It's a pretty ballad, not great and not bad, simply it could have been a lot better. A good song to give other singers to.<br /><br />4. Wedding Day 5/5 Stars. Barry and Robin's interplay on this song. One of their finest. Good song.<br /><br />5. Man In The Middle 5/5 Stars. The late Maurice sings on this one. It's a great autobiographical track especially the chorus. Great song.<br /><br />6. Deja Vu. 4/5 Stars. This Robin-Led Song. I like it.<br /><br />7. Technicoulor Dreams:4/5 Stars. My least favorite track on the album. It sounds like a small bar show tune with the sound of a clarinent in the midle. It is just a different song.<br /><br />8. Walking On Air: 5/5 Stars. One of the album s'best. Everithing sound perfect here. Maurice sings on this one too. The guitars, the synthesizers, the tempo, the drum programming,etc. is perfect.<br /><br />9. Loose Talk Costs Lives: 3/5 Stars. Barry lead this one. Its a filler, not bad but....<br /><br />10. Embrace. 5/5 Stars. Great up-beat tempo on this one. Good song.<br /><br />11. The Extra Mile. 4/5 Stars. Good. Barry and Robin lead on this one.<br /><br />12. Voice In The Wilderness. 4/5 Stars. A great rocker to end the album and the final song of the final studio album by one of music best bands ever !
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Ghost Protocol is a great movie choice for parents if your kids have grown past films like The Lion King and Ice Age, but are still too young for anything R-rated. With its mature storyline and action-packed footage, Ghost Protocol has an R-rated feel, but without the excessive sexual content and bad language that accompanies true R-rated movies. It's a great compromise for parents and those teens who're in a hurry to grow up.<br /><br />My only negative comment about the movie is that a couple of scenes are difficult to follow due to the mixture of action and dialogue.

Highly recommend.  As a day hiker and outdoor junkie, I admire her strength and courage - her tenacity.  Her journey was inspiring -
B006CHML4I|5.0|I was surfing on Amazon the other night and stumbled upon this watch. For some reason the blue one is less expensive than the other colors so that was a little score because it's the one I wanted anyways. Some other reviews complain about the accuracy. Mine is too new to comment on that and I honestly don't care about that as I can just look at my phone if I need the EXACT time. Plus or minus a few minutes and the occasional reset are fine with me as I just like the way it looks and watching the automatic movement. The aesthetics are nearly perfect in my eyes and better in person than in the picture.<br /><br />The strap is nylon, not canvas but that's probably better for durability. It's a Seiko so I trust it to be around for a long time. I'm just curious to see how it will age and if it will scratch easily. At this price, I can't complain or expect much but I'm still going to be hopeful. I tend to write reviews for only items that I'm quite fond of. I've bought alot of things on Amazon but only reviewed a handful of items. That should tell you how happy I am!<br /><br />Lastly, it's comes in a very nice box if you're planning on giving this as a gift.

I broke my first pair by stretching the headset too far away from my head when i took them off.<br /><br />for 21$ i cant recommend a better headset. Sound quality is decent but spend +30$ more you can get a far better headset.

The book delves into SEAL Team SIX, and reports on one man, Adam Brown, and the ultimate sacrifice he made for this country.  Just in time for Memorial Day, this is one book that is NOT to be missed.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There is so much depth and color in the world of literature, and this book is a perfect example of that. Green has this style that I've yet to see in any other YA fiction -- hilarious and poignant, sweet but raw. His characters are not easily forgotten, and they are so hard to say goodbye to. I hated coming to the end of this book, hated knowing that my time in Hazel Grace's world was up. This story will break your heart, if you let it, but it's worth it.
0802798225|5.0|This is an amazing story and i have read and reread it and i still love it. This is as real as it gets.(Mostly) Its a definate must read if you are into teen romance.

I loved the twist that was placed on time travel seeing as I am a history major. Ive read every thing King has written and this is King at the top of his game. It shows why he is the Charles Dickens of our time.

B007BVOF8E|2.0|The acting was good, but I found the story quite slow, and didn't quite keep my attention the whole time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read the whole trilogy. I kept thinking something would happen to warrant all the hype. That and the fact that I always have to finish a story, even if its bad. Well, this was bad. I've read novels that were available for free on Kindle that had a better story line and sex scenes than this. Seriously? Women of the world, you are deprived in your sex life and I can't even believe you have never come across reading an erotic novel before. Not even by accident? This fantasy is so unrealistic and amateur in its story line. The worst ending I've ever read. I felt like I could have wrote this in Highschool. Jeesh.

0553386794|5.0|If you start reading this, you will probably end up getting sucked into this world and that is a significant time investment.  The writing is top-notch, but you will have to wait a long time to see the story's conclusion.
0385342063|4.0|Even though this book made me snicker a lot, I can not get past the disgusting \\"four\\" letter word.<br /><br />Is this word used in the UK as a substitute for \\"shoot\\" \\"darn\\" and even \\"crap\\"?  I find this appalling.  There is another English author who I think can really write a good story, but her books also use this tone.<br /><br />To me it is vulgar and I wish for a kinder, gentler society.
0553801473|5.0|Sure it may not be as exciting as the first three, but the book is still excellent and necessary to the proper continuation of the story.  I do not really know where all of the rage surrounding this and the fourth book come from, but I think a lot of it comes from the time that people have had to wait on them and the expectations that they built up.  Rather than getting any resolution, this book ultimately leaves you with more waiting.  I am fine with that, but I can see why others are not I guess.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is incredible, and i think it is the best in the series (so far at least).  I would strongly recommend it to anyone.
B003O86FMW|2.0|I found this trilogy disturbing and a foreshadowing of where a Republican US government could take us. The trilogy is an allegory on what happens when the elite and controlling top 1% and their minions destroy the middle class and turn it into subservient slave workers. They keep the 99% in check with 'games' that remind the former middle class how powerless they are against the monied elite.<br />Catching Fire is depressing but an interesting commentary on our political system and where it could go.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This is probably my least favorite entry in the series, but that does not mean I did not think the book was great.  Following the incredible third book, it really is a change of pace and many of my favorite characters did not even get chapters (had to wait till book five to get theirs).  This is essentially one humongous book that was split into books four and five, so things are going to be different than what you are used to.  That said, it is still an amazing entry in the series that is necessary to set up what is in store.

B0083EW97W|5.0|\\"Born and Raised\\" captures the essence and the best of what John had to offer in the earlier albums, \\"Room for Squares,\\" \\"Heavier Things\\" and \\"Continuum\\" --He successfully builds on the past without necessarily repeating or rehashing it-a feat often attempted by successful performers, but not always so easy to achieve.  The mood is quieter and pensive.  Overall, the arrangements are sparse & reserved with his acoustic guitar leading the way.  As usual, the vocals are solid and you can see how far he's evolved as a songwriter- The 9th track, \\"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967,\\" stands out the most among the others beginning with a gentle horn and carried along with minimal keyboards, drums and guitar.  It best embodies the themes of redemption and renewal that pervade the album-- \\"Cause when you're done with this world/You know the next is up to you.\\"  Other gems are \\"A Face to Call Home\\" and \\"Shadow Days\\" -delivered with a chastened and weary spirit, yet striving toward hope and brighter days.  A wonderful album-  great job, John.  And thanks so much for keeping a low profile.

0439023491|2.0|Expectation:  Situation gets more difficult; Young Heroine steps up to be the iconic savior of a nation.<br /><br />Actual: The pace of this book series hits a brick wall at this book.  The series really dwells on the love-triangle between Katniss & the two male leads.<br /><br />Result:  Katniss becomes really hard to identify with.  Her choices range from indecisive to irrational - but not in the charming anti-hero type of way.  It's really hard to see her as the \\"Heroine of the Nation\\" as she seems more interested in romance than actually doing any work.<br /><br />Conclusion:  If you enjoyed Book 2, you'll probably like Book 3.  Personally, I finished just to say I completed the series.  If you feel it's going slow, it's downhill from here.
B003VFEROQ|4.0|As a David Bowie fan, I've always enjoyed hearing covers of his work, and WE WERE SO TURNED ON has plenty of covers to choose from.  I wouldn't recommend this to the casual Bowie listener; the two-disc set covers a ton of material, and many of the best covers come from songs that weren't his most popular.  It's interesting that many of the covers here fall into electronic/indie territory (bands perhaps more influenced from the Berlin Trilogy than the early catalog).  Sadly, there isn't much material from early 90's and onward.  At its best, this compilation takes great Bowie songs and gives them new perspective; at its worst, bands seem to not understand what makes the song great in the first place and makes a misstep.  Because the quality of the covers vary wildly, I would either recommend streaming/sampling this album first before buying it.  The best option is probably buying individual MP3's of the songs that you enjoyed sampling; the overbearing length of the collection probably works best that way.<br /><br />Highlights include Chairlift's slick rendition of \\"Always Crashing in the Same Car,\\" Xu Xu Fang's dark and sexy take on \\"China Girl,\\" and Carla Bruni's bare piano treatment of \\"Absolute Beginners.\\"  If you are really into David Bowie, this compilation will both surprise and disappoint, but luckily, it leaves a good impression (even if it runs a little too long).
B007SYWFRM|4.0|so far i can't  complain. it's fun. easy to play. nice pace. you don't need others to level up and cokplete tasks. works great on my kindle fire.
B003XX2PD6|5.0|Deerhunter's HALCYON DIGEST is a whirlwind of repetition, drones, experimentation, distortion, and melodic hooks.  This collection of songs probably ranks as the most easy accessible and digestible of the Deerhunter/Bradford Cox catalog; it will probably serve as a great gateway for beginners to the Deerhunter canon. Musically, the album feels like a musical successor to Radiohead's OK COMPUTER.  It's all over the place in terms of tempo and timbre, but the album is maintained by a strange sadness.  All of these songs stand on their own as good accomplishments, and together, they form a complete, coherent album.  It's one of the best in years.<br /><br />The album rarely repeats itself in regards to style and timbre.  \\"Earthquake,\\" the intro track, is a great slow-burning landscape; \\"Revival\\" is an all too brief uptempo track dabbling in distortion, electronics, and acoustics; \\"Desire Lines\\" is a solid rock song that ends in a flurry of ambience; \\"He Would Have Laughed\\" is the only track I don't particularly care for, but it too is wildly different than anything else on the album.  Again, while these songs are diverse in their own styles, they coalesce together nicely as a unified whole.<br /><br />This album is so good that I would suggest a blind-buy (buying without even previewing it).  I'd recommend HALCYON DIGEST to fans of Radiohead, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective.  Recommended highlights: \\"Desire Lines,\\" \\"Helicopter,\\" \\"Fountain Stairs,\\" and \\"Revival.\\"
0061692042|4.0|This novel was test of endurance for a number of reasons, subject, particularity of detail and length. It is a depressing tale of a brother and sister in the 1960s, fraternal twins Dell and Berner, whose parents rob a bank in North Dakota, return home to their fifteen-year-old children in Montana and are soon arrested for their crime. The convoluted logic that leads to the robbery is accounted in the first half of the book in an emotionless narrative by Dell that describes two mismatched parents, too few years of relative domestic harmony culminating in Montana, where Bev Parsons becomes involved in an illegal scheme that leaves him in severe financial jeopardy. His solution- the only way out he believes- is a bank robbery in another state, his wife coerced into acting as Bev's partner in lieu of their son, Dell.<br /><br />The prose is funereal, the first part of the novel delivering a now homeless Dell to Saskatchewan, Canada (his sister runs away to avoid the same fate) in the care of Arthur Remlinger, brother of Dell's mother's friend Mildred Remlinger. Helpless and hopeless, Dell is at the mercy of strangers in another country, one step ahead of Montana officials prepared to put the twins into the state's custody. Left to fend for himself with Remlinger's handyman in tiny Partreau, Charlie Quarters, Dell yearns for the attention of his enigmatic, albeit illegal guardian. From a two-room shack with no amenities to Arthur's hotel, the Leonard in the more populous Fort Royal, Dell is finally taken under his guardian's wing, only later discovering the man's unsavory past and activities that demands a reckoning with two strangers from Detroit looking for Remlinger.<br /><br />While Dell's sojourn in Canada is more eventful than his past in Montana- save the crime that severs children from parents' forever- a challenging, tainted childhood is even more bizarre under Arthur's care, the boy thrust into an untenable position with no one to shield him from the consequences of his mistakes in judgment. It is only Dell's common sense and thoughtful response to crisis that frees him from the random mendacity of adults. Witnessing the treachery of those around him through this young man's eyes is a daunting experience, a hardscrabble life with few moments of happiness or contentment. Literary this work of fiction may be, but also ponderous and as thoroughly detailed as an eighteenth century novel. I give Ford four stars for his perseverance and total commitment to Dell's coming-of-age struggle to survive his fate. Luan Gaines/2012.es of his mistakes in judgment.

B003HARV3Y|1.0|It's been a while since I've seen this movie (watched in theaters), but I recall that the movie was Hollywood's overhaul of an otherwise great series of books.  The books were subtle, mischievous, and fun while the movie was an explosion-laden, shallow delivery of instant gratification which killed any hope for a sequel.  Key points that I recall that were serious and almost unforgivable transgressions against the books:<br /><br /> **Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />1) Poseidon appearing as an old sailor - from my memory he always appeared as the stereotypical surfer/beachcomber.<br />2) The reason for the hydra fight in the museum - the hydra was fought in the swamps of Florida and for an entirely different reason.<br />3) Huge plot gaps with missing involvement of Aries, Aphrodite and other figures in Greek mythology<br />4) The antagonist and the use was utterly wrong and held little to no connection to anything happening in the book.  There was never any indication of who the TRUE antagonist was and the threat ended with the final fight.<br />5) The love interest was developed too quickly and the tension that was existent throughout the series was cast aside.<br /><br />This series of books could've been turned into a wonderful trilogy of movies (it absolutely had the potential), but all of that was squandered by some Hollywood blow-hard ripping all that was good from the story.  This was the first time I've ever walked away from a movie angry, but this was clearly someone trying to cash in on a title and nothing more.

B002ZMZBD2|5.0|This was bought for our son.  He has a liking to this kind of music.  When he finds one he likes he gets it right away.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|I avoided this movie because I rarely enjoy horror and I heard it wasn't much for a Scorsese film.  But I had access to it one day and played it out of boredom.  It's not horror by a long shot.  Some definite disturbing images, but from the trailer I thought it would be much more graphic.<br /><br />Instead, it's a mystery thriller with a noir flavor.  The plot is telegraphed from the beginning, but lucky for me I'm not really a plot guy.  Atmosphere, acting, and ethos are what draw me in, and this movie is soaked in those.<br /><br />This is the rare movie where I didn't mind style over substance.  I was never invested enough in the lead character to be deeply sadenned by his plight.  For this reason, I was safely detatched and could just enjoy the show: a winking you-already-know-who-dunnit spectacle of men in hats smoking cigarettes.<br /><br />I took a class on Film Noir and, while it didn't become a favorite genre of mine, I learned to like haunted, life-weary men walking around in shadows and delivering bittersweet lines with panache.  When movies like this one (and like The Man Who Wasn't There) cash in on that atmosphere smartly I usually have a good time with it.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if Scorsese took this movie as seriously as some of the folks who hate it.  I don't think he's a plot guy, either.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|What a disappointment and waste of money. This movie was terrible, the previews literally showed the best part of the film. The \\"hero\\" spends most of the movie getting beat up, and losing his grip on the one thing he needs to protect at all costs. If your looking for something like 300, just watch 300. Avoid this movie.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|What I feared was that the song writing would have suffered when Ben Moody left, but it hasn't. Evanescence's second album \\"The Open Door\\" is another hit! Their music sounds a bit different to me than their first album, but it just shows that they've kept their uniqueness. My VERY favorites on the album are: \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\", \\"Lacrymosa\\", \\"Like You\\", and \\"The Only One\\". The slow songs on the album are: \\"Lithium\\", \\"Like You\\", and \\"Good Enough\\", all of which are very powerful, just as the ones on their first album had been. All of their songs have a cool, unique sound to them and you can not only hear the meaning behind the lyrics, you can feel it through their music. I definitely recommend this album as well as their first album, \\"Fallen\\"!

B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Evanescence's first single, \\"Bring Me To Life\\", I thought, what a unique and awesome sound this band has. Usually I listen to samples from CDs before I buy them, but I just went ahead and bought this one, assuming the rest of the songs would be as good as the first one I heard. I was and still am VERY happy I bought this album! I listen to it, as well as the other Evanescence albums all the time! My ONLY problem with Evanescence is that they should've released more albums since 2003. It's really hard to pick a favorite from this album. What I would've wanted to know before I bought it (not that it would've mattered cause all the songs are awesome): \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" are the only slow songs. The rest are rock. Also, the music and the lyrics are brilliantly written and played out. If you don't already own a copy (or haven't downloaded the mp3s), you should definitely check it out!

The prolific Joe Bonamassa is back with a new CD (11 tracks) : of which 5 are originals in \\"Dislocated Boy\\" (great first single), \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" (incredibly beautiful title track, my favourite track from this CD), \\"I Got All You Need\\", \\"Heavenly Soul\\" & \\"Somewhere Trouble Don't Go\\" and the other 6 are covers. Joe Bonamassa delivers great blues music in this new CD (wonderful blues guitar, melody & vocals) : stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Dislocated Boy\\",  \\"Driving Towards The Daylight\\" (slow-tempo track with incredible melody, great blues guitar work & high-pitched vocals. Song like this doesn't come along very often. Can't get enough of this track at the moment), \\"I Got All You Need\\", \\"New Coat Of Paint\\" (a wonderful Tom Waits' cover) & \\"Too Much Ain't Enough\\" (a rocky-blues track from this 1987 hit by Australian rock superstar Jimmy Barnes. The song features Jimmy Barnes himself on vocals with Joe Bonamassa, a beautiful version of this 80s rock hit). Great tracks include \\"Stones On My Passway\\" (a rocky-blues cover of Robert Johnson's song), \\"Who's Been Talking\\" (Howlin Wolf's cover), \\"A Place In My Heart\\" (Bernie Marsden of Whitesnake's cover, great blues guitar work), \\"Lonely Town Lonely Street\\" (Bill Withers) & \\"Somewhere Trouble Don't Go\\". Okay track for me is \\"Heavenly Soul\\".<br /><br />On overall, the prolific blues singer-songwriter/guitarist Joe Bonamassa doesn't disappoint in this new CD release 'Driving Towards The Daylight', great blues music with some rocky guts, a highly recommended CD listening.
0345803485|5.0|Fascinating! I must say this is the most intense book I've ever read and by far the best. I could re read this book over and over and doubt I would get bored. This book makes me want to be in ana's spot! My favorite....absolutely! A must read for people who enjoy an exciting book that makes a woman giggle and squirm in her seat while reading!
B007O3QC8K|5.0|After finding much to love in Rattle's previous Bruckner 4th, also with the Berliners, I hoped that this reading would seal Rattle's success as a Brucknerian.  In the \\"Romantic\\" Symphony, Rattle made his case by emphasizing the work's romantic qualities, letting pure lyricism come forth.  But the 9th Symphony demands a certain commitment to a dark world that isn't all about joy.  Could Rattle find meaning in a work that throbs with inherent spirituality?  And could he make a persuasive case for this new completed version of the finale?<br /><br />I had my doubts.  I'm a devoted fan of Rattle's, considering his Brahms' symphonies set and his Schoenberg disc from last year to be monumental achievements, but I had no small qualms about the idea of a transversal into Bruckner's most religiously intense work.  Rattle has transformed the Berliners into a band that shines with a transparency that I'm not sure we've ever seen anywhere else.  I've yet to find a conductor who even approaches Rattle in his ability to make the most out of the most intricate details in the score.  I knew we would experience world-class voicing.  But would Rattle merely fuss over Bruckner's immense score, leaving us with great orchestral playing but little more?<br /><br />The answer, thank God, is a resounding no.  I'm reeling under the shock of how good this disc is.  Instead of relying on his orchestra's ability to make beautiful sounds, Rattle has found dark intensity in the work.  Who knew that he had such a feel for the long line?  I'm not sure if even Karajan betters him in this regard.  But what separates him from his great predecessor is his flexibility.  Where Karajan is rigid, Rattle lets the line expand, producing moments of soulfulness that reaches into the beyond.  I was astonished at how successfully Rattle is able to let the music fluctuate.  He understands that there are times when the music needs to stop and breathe.  Yet for all his flexibility, he never once sounds mannered or fussy.  He knows when to build and when to hold back--you never want to let go too soon in Bruckner.<br /><br />What Rattle isn't insistent on producing is terror.  A fellow reviewer and friend finds this album less than satisfactory for that reason.  I can see his point--the music doesn't scare us as with Karajan--yet for myself I feel the music can almost sink in deeper when bombast isn't employed.  Rattle is so sincere that the music is often heartbreaking.  Instead of frightening us, Rattle draws us near and lets the poeticism of the work move us.  There was hardly a moment in the entire symphony that I wasn't fighting the tears.  This is music-making on a level that denies the power of words.  Expansive and fraught with fervent emotion, Rattle lets all the bittersweet memories of the past wash over us in waves.<br /><br />The Berliners play with all the authority we'd expect.  Listeners are sure to notice that Rattle doesn't give the brass the prominence they usually receive in Bruckner.  They're not overpowered, though, just kept in check enough to let the rest of the orchestra clearly state their parts.  In a miracle of inspiration, Rattle lets us hear details that we never imagined were there, yet it somehow welds into a comprehensive whole.<br /><br />As for the completed finale, Rattle interprets it so well that it seems that it always belonged.  Rattle claims in the liner notes that there's more Bruckner here than there is Mozart in his Requiem and I'm inclined to agree.  I hope it wins acceptance.<br /><br />Rattle as arrived as a mature Brucknerian.  This is a huge victory a conductor who has struggled convincing critics that he has what it takes to master the German romantic repertoire. If this isn't success, I'm not sure what is.fussy.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game looks like a lot of good, clean fun, with colorful, amusing graphics and happy sound effects. Play is sufficiently challenging that light game players 8 to 88 years old should not get bored with it. The trouble is that I installed it on my Android phone for my 5-year-old daughter to play, and it proved to be beyond her. I do not spend much time playing games on my phone, and since I got it free from the Amazon App Store, I opted not to keep it.<br /><br />I docked this game one star for poor playing instructions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am reading the book right now and it is very intriguing. I don't know what to expect from the characters for the author hides and reveals the characters so well. It keeps me guessing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great tool to easily take the time to read the word.  I like the devotions selection -way more then I thought there was going to be.  Plus a wide range of subjects and time ranges, something for everyone.  Even kids and teens!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this e-book very helpful in helping me set up my first Kindle e-book,  [[ASIN:B007WD7SSK The Face of Love]].  I especially loved how simple the process was laid out in the book--in fact, it helped me to get my book up and running in less than a day! Anyone wanting to make their own Kindle e-book will definitely find this to be the all-in-one guide to help them through the process!
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Saw this in the movies and just HAD to have it.  Pre-ordered and have been enjoying the disc ever since.  Got the delux set so my son and daughter could enjoy it on their computers.  Please, please don't miss this - ok, I'm a geek but it's soooooooooooooooooooooooo wonderful.
B007SGM084|1.0|I have all but stopped using my kindle. Living in France people back home in Uk quote prices for books to me which just make using kindle obsolete. Its just far too expensive now to 'download' when I can have the book for a fraction of the cost. Very, disappointed in Kindle now and hardly use it.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|What can I say - I'm hooked.  The family wanted me to see the series but I held out thinking it was boring but WOW when I finally checked it out I was totally hooked.  Sets and performances are supurb.  Music, costuming fabulous.  Can't wait for 3rd season.
B007ZTN07O|5.0|installed on Kindle Fire and HTC Vivid.<br /><br />pros:  responsive touch controls and buttons.  vibrant colors and effects translated very well into mobile platform.  character animation has also made a good transition over as well.  extras like challenge, endless, and unlockable artwork give good replay value.<br /><br />cons:  character selection could be better given that KOF-i 2012 has a much larger selection.<br /><br />other than that, this is a very well made mobile port of a great arcade game.  hopefully we get an update soon for more characters!
1401307450|1.0|I have always been a fan. I just wish to read the positive side of being a multimillionaire. The world has too much negativity and tragedy.

Just don't abuse consumers with public information for profit.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this is a pretty good game. you get coins fast and there's fun things to do. it just needs more interactive games.
B007Q35PLI|4.0|The movie about Temple Grandin is very positive about one person's path to not only cope but excell with Autism.  A lot of credit needs to go to Temple's patient and dedicated Mother.  The caring support her Aunt, High School Science Teacher and an understanding room mate also were part of Temples later attainment of influence and success in Animal handling and Autism treatment. Wonderful story and acting about a real and interesting person.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is great for wasting away some time, not overly easy or difficult but a perfect time killer if you ask me.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Everything you need elegantly displayed! Great Job! It was worth the ninety nine cents. Works very well on my Kindle fire! keep the apps coming!
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app's functions are all here; news, forecasts, current conditions. What I think is cool is the weather service - which is not in the version for iOS.
B005D81W5Q|2.0|I felt like the whole concept of Bad Teacher was stupid. However, I did laugh at parts. This has more of a stupid humor. The story line wasn't very good at all. This is only worth a rental and not a purchase! I just felt like the whole movie was off for some reason, that the characters and story was just there for the sake of being there with no real purpose. I don't really know who to describe it. It almost seemed by the end of the movie nothing was really achieved and we're at the beginning again. Overall, two stars for at least keeping me semi interested with barely decent humor.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Definitely worth buying if you like Sade.  Especially if you went to the concert.  We went to the concert in Phoenix and it was fantastic!  I spoke to friends across the country and word-of-mouth was that this was one of the best concerts of the year - even for those years younger than us (we are mid-forties.)  Saw some criticism on the number of cuts/edits.  I did not believe these to be excessive.  It seemed about right to me.  The beautiful sets translated very well to Blu-ray.  I own numerous concert discs and this is one of the best.  Highly recommended!
B000QRIGJY|5.0|I thought the book was a good read, though the jurisdictional conflict between the Feds. and the locals was a bit overdone. I liked the the character of Harry Bosch. He's irascible and not well liked. Despite all the obstacles thrown in his path he gets his man. He's a believable character.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]
B007CKNX28|3.0|This album has little stand-out material and frequent stretches where the music fails to hold attention.<br /><br />In style, it's closer to The Raconteurs than The White Stripes. The diverse instrumentation includes a lot of piano (but not a cheesy Billy Joel way). It's OK, but piano rock is usually a take-it-or-leave-it proposition for me.<br /><br />Folks looking for great new rock n' roll would to well do check out [[ASIN:B003SG8168 J Roddy Walston & The Business]] instead -- especially those looking piano rock.
044655667X|5.0|I just finished reading The Fifth Witness and thought it was really good. I liked the way Mickey Haller goes into detail about both developing his courtroom strategy and understanding the strategy of the prosecution.<br /><br />In his cross examinations he is laser sharp. He doesn't hit you over the head with one revelation but rather builds the seeds of doubt little by little with each cross examination. If I ever get into serious trouble I hope I can find a defense attorney like Mickey.<br /><br />Philip Lear author [[ASIN:B0066PQSJA Writer Interruptus and Other Stories]]
0307730697|5.0|Fearless by Eric Blehm is the true story of Adam Brown, a member of Navy SEAL Team SIX, who struggled with drugs as a young adult, found God and turned his life around to the point he was a member of one of the most highly trained teams in the world. It is an incredible journey with many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />This book has it all from a psycho young man striving to be the best at everything he tried to a drug addict throwing his life away to a Navy SEAL saving lives and taking out evil people. In between these three stages of life are many struggles, injuries and life experiences that are interesting to hear about and at times breath taking to behold.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that Adam Brown was not a perfect man but he overcame his troubles to excel in a field that few succeed. He wanted to make sure that his complete story was told, so as to help others who may be struggling with addiction based issues that threatened to wreck his life.<br /><br />This book does contain some pro-war propaganda and I am not a supporter of the war but it is to be expected as it is a soldier's perspective of the war. Although I don't support the war, I have the utmost respect for the soldiers that are over there doing their job and hopefully making the world a better place and the sacrifices they make on a daily basis should not be underestimated.<br /><br />The narration was quite interesting because the narrator, Paul Michael, attempted to play multiple people including women. I think it would have worked better if a woman did the female voices and he just spoke the male voices but I quite enjoyed the overall effect. I found the narration quite interesting and it helped convey the different opinions of the people central to Adam's life.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I have read in a long time because it was so interesting and inspiring to see someone who didn't start out perfect but achieved so much in such a short space of time to become a true hero.<br /><br />This audio book was gifted as a part of the christianaudio Reviewers Program in exchange for my unbiased review of this work.

B004JN1D2I|2.0|It is ok, and the lay out is fine. Only problem is that the pagecount stops after the first book is finished. Bit inconvenient.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I'm a fairly shy person when out meeting new people, thought this book would be useful.  Have to say I found it very dull and it lost my attention after a few lines of each chapter.
B006YZHEB8|5.0|Excellent Service! Definitely recommend this movie and Facing the Giants. They are both from the same Director and Writer. Thanks!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I haven't read a book like this in many years.  The sexual tension was so thick that I had to force myself to go to sleep at 4:00 AM at my first read!<br />I was surprised at my reaction.  I am now 60% into the third in the series.  You have to read all three!

1401234542|4.0|In 8 years since Geoff Johns took over Green Lantern, Hal Jordan has reclaimed his position among Batman and Superman as top tier characters in the DC Universe that expanded upon the entire GL mythology including the entire light spectrum of lantern corps., and Blackest Night, and a whole bunch of continuity like never before.  What Johns also did was make Hal Jordan's greatest villain Sinestro, far more complex and villainous being then ever done.  After [[ASIN:1401232345 Green Lantern: War of the Green Lanterns]] and [[ASIN:1401233430 War of the Green Lanterns: Aftermath]], Sinestro went from being that top villain, and thanks to an odd twist of fate became a Green Lantern again, while Jordan was discharged from the GL Corps. all just before The New 52 Re-boot.  Now Johns begins this new chapter in the GL legacy with Sinestro at the helm and this looks to be quite a different chapter at that.<br /><br />GREEN LANTERN: SINESTRO collects issues #1-6 and begins with Hal Jordan (again, discharged from the Corps.) back on Earth and trying to fit back into modern society, which hasn't been working out for him in his favor (all done in a comedic fashion).  All the while back at Oa, Sinestro wants nothing of being a GL again, but has no choice in the matter but to follow the orders of the Guardians.  Sinestro wants to take back his Yellow Lanterns, but finds out they strayed away from his teaching due to his new allegiance to the GLs...Sinestro then needs Hal Jordan by his side to take back his old Corp...but with a huge catch.  All the while Hal and Sinestro go at it, the Guardians are tired of Hal, Sinestro, and the other lanterns going against them and want to start a new corps.; a third corps.  What we get is one heck of a funny, interesting, and buddy comic of two rival's butting-heads and working together for a greater cause.<br /><br />Geoff Johns writes a very different book to start the New 52, with Sinestro taking over as main character and Hal being the \\"side kick\\".  The tone is lighter and far more talkative then any book Johns has done in his 8 year run on GL, which is quite refreshing to try out for long time readers of Johns run.  It does have some action to it, but subtle.  We sort of had a smidgen of this in ([[ASIN:1401231411 Green Lantern: Brightest Day (Green Lantern Graphic Novels)]]), but it's in full swing in this book.  Hal has a series of comedic turns trying to live on Earth now without a power ring and seeing Sinestro as a GL for the first real time and getting into his mindset is interesting considering we get behind his actions now, not denounce them when he was the villain.  And when Hal and Sinestro actually have to work together, it's that rarity when the hero and villain's ideologies and egos clash for an entertaining read to watch unfold, especially for long time readers.<br /><br />Doug Mahnke's art is great as ever.  A sense of sketchy and clean and be crazy designs in his splash pages that carry well with Johns story narrative.  His art never gets old.  Mike Choi's art in issue #6 is decent but hurts the flow narrative.  It's utterly different from Mahnke's art with younger, more anime-styled characters.  I don't mind it since the one issue is a transition piece for the next arc, but it's still noticeable.<br /><br />As for a possible setback, the tone change for established fans might not like this.  As mentioned before, this is quite a talkative arc compared to other GL arcs in the past and it might seem tame to some readers.  The other thing is for new readers who have probably been thinking about jumping on Johns run on GL at some point.  Well I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is decent start for new readers.  New readers get a relative generalization of the GL lore and mythos, but new readers will miss out on a lot of information with the character dynamics and future plot points that established readers have been following.  Much of the great chemistry in reading about Hal andSinestro is based off of the long history these characters have, as well as most of the conversations being expositions about the built-up mythos, all of which will be lost to new readers.  Add to this, many plot points in the future to come will revert back to previous knowledge of the GL mythos that new readers again will be lost in.  So although GL:Sinestro is probably the best/roughest choice to jump on in Johns run for newbie's, I highly recommend as a prerequisite go start back at ([[ASIN:B0064W657K Green Lantern: Rebirth (New Edition)]]) and work your way all the way up to this point.  I assure you it's for the best.<br /><br />GREEN LANTERN VOL.1: SINESTRO is the start/prelude of what looks like another long and interesting journey in the GL legacy, with Sinestro and Hal looking like the ultimate odd couple in comics that long time readers get an opening taste of what's to come down the road.  New readers can jump on, but be extremely cautious if you do.  A new chapter in GL lore in on the horizon and it all starts here.Sinestro is based off of the long history these characters have, as well as most of the conversations being expositions about the built-up mythos, all of which will be lost to new readers.

0312330537|5.0|I found this book hard to get into at first, but well worth the effort. I started it twice without getting too far into it, but the third time was the charm. Once I got past the first 150-200 pages, I could not put it down. The author's adventures may be a bit over the top, but his depiction of places, especially Bombay, people, and relationships is incandescent. Highly recommended.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|As always, Meryl delivers an outstanding performance. I do agree with the critics that it was a bit disappointing that quite a bit of the movie focused on Mrs. Thatcher's decline.

B000V1Z8KK|1.0|A product of the Hollywood war on the Bush administration and character assassination of our veterans and patriots that believe and serve our country.  I decided to watch, just to see how much leftoid crap they could write into the screenplay and finally, at the end, could stand no more.

Went to call steel series and they have no phone! your supposed to submit an email request online and wait 3 days for a response. I dont think so , the mouse was more than the game itself! Its absolutely absurd that a company can get away with no having a phone number where customers can reach them and actually talk to a representative. Boycott Steel Series!
B0084YC5UC|5.0|this time the show's two most beautiful characters go out together, not for some tryst but because joan blew up in the office when served with her divorce. as usual, this show goes for the rarely before televised.  how many people ever think about two beautiful people having problems in their love lives?  creator matthew weiner lets us see that these people may be set up for little else but problems.  it is so easy for them to attract others that they wander into relationships without as much thought or work as a less gifted person does.  thus, the woeful times which await them.  no other show has ever explored this. the product they are paired off with is also beautiful, a Jaguar car of that era. ironically enough, also experiencing problems which were later resolved by Ford Motor.<br /><br />there is, of course, loads more in the episode but for me personally this was the most profound entry.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0057567P0|1.0|Sonnet USB 3.0 ExpressCard/34 USB3-2PM-E34 is not a reliable product and the quality of build is questionable for the casing build is of low quality (very flimsy).<br />I have tested the Vantec and Startech 3.0 usb designs and quality of build and found them reliable and sturdy where the Sonnet brand is defiantly not.<br />Sonnet's Quality Assurance and Quality Control are very poor when it comes to the materials used and reliability in regards to failure of the internal electronics as well.<br /><br />In conclusion the Sonnet USB 3.0 ExpressCard/34 USB3-2PM-E34 is prone to electronic failure in addition to poor quality of materials used in the build in comparison to the reliability of Vantec and Startech products in materials and electronic components which are very reliable indeed. Never shop by price for just because it is expensive does not necessarily mean the quality is any better.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I was very surprised by this film. I was completely captivated by this movie once I started watching it.  It very much reminded of many of the Jules Verne films I grew up with, but as it progressed I could see more parallels with H. G. Wells given its inert statement on political issues and establishments. This is a highly entertaining film with incredible visuals and hats off to Edgar Rice Burroughs' Confederate Civil War hero. Mars no less!

B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is an impressive film based on the ground breaking heroics of the Tuskegee Airmen. Despite the racism and a reticent military establishment to give these men some credence and a chance to serve their country, they outshine all the disparagers and achieve their aspirations to the \\"call of duty\\" above and beyond even their own expectations. This is the stuff dreams and heroes are made of. I like this film because it does not preach to the viewer, but instead lets the visuals of all that heroism speak for itself. This is a good stand up and cheer movie that celebrates these men. I highly recommend it.
