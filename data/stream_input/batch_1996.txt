B009MF56GC|5.0|I enjoyed Expendables 2 much more than the first movie. The sound was much better and I felt the script and acting better.<br />The film was beautiful to watch. Another excellent production distributed By Lionsgate.<br />I liked all the actors in the film and the story had better continuity.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book isn't just for romantic relationships.  It applies to all relationships, including friends, acquaintances, and co-workers.  It really helps to understand what makes people like you.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Hilarious.<br />Mark Walhberg is very funny and a bunch of other recognizable actors,  point blank this is funny.  NO KIDS this is only an adult comedy.
081299471X|5.0|This was a perfect buy!  Delivery, transaction, quality were excellent!  Reasonably priced for this buy!  This was a gift and the recipient was thoroughly pleased!  Would recommend this seller to all those looking for similar products.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|very much awesome with another side of awesome and a little bit of cool sprinkled on it for some flavor.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Great book<br />One of the best in my opinion that is. Probably going to read the second book for sure
B00062PN6I|5.0|Love the sound and it arrived before it said it would. I love using them on my I-pod and while I am traveling with my parent.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable show! It is nice to see new and fresh stories produced and not the fairy tales I grew up with skewed into something different. Delightful!
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I like the style of the ablum. Certain parts reminded me of Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and the Beach Boys. i really liked One Foot, All Alright, Out on the Town, the songs were really good. It reminded me of late 80s early 90s electro pop. And the all the songs are very personal and so open. Nate Ruess?? does a really great job singing all of these songs.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The new book was extremely well thought out and definitely tied for my favorite but I do have some suggestions I think that they really could have been more detailed description of the girl who was Greg and Rowley date and I really wish that they have some of holly hills in it for Greg's date and I would have loved his parents and Roderick and Manny In it more
B009KS4XRO|1.0|keep getting error Msg 401 that it can't connect to fb account. follow instructions to log out then log back in. still does not work. have to uninstall then reinstall and it will work for a bit. then get error Msg again.  not worth the hassle. I recommend waiting until bugs r fixed- and as a long time bingo blitz player who survived the beta period on fb, I can say with confidence that buffalo studios will be unresponsive for a while b4 they look at fixing issue
B004HXIZVC|1.0|I downloaded this app and was only able to use it twice. Now, it won't even open. It just shows a black screen! Until this is fixed, this gets a terrible rating.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I caught this when it was streaming free on Netflix and proceeded to watch it everyday for weeks.  I would work in the office and let it run in the background.  But I'm also a huge fan of Pride & Prejudice as well as time travel romance so this movie was literally made for me.  Of course I knew the Pride & Prejudice 'story' prior to watching but had never seen any of the P&P movies - after watching this and then watching P&P I do prefer the Lost in Austen take on the story.<br /><br />My recommendation:  BUY IT AND FALL IN LOVE!!
B005HSL626|5.0|A lot of fun and there aren't many advertisements. This game is very fun and a good free game. Download it.
B0042816YK|5.0|Being a woman I think we've all wanted to do just as the main character in this movie does... take off on a soul searching journey looking for who we really are.  This is a wonderful movie and great for anyone that needs to live vicariously for 2+ hours.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best! There aren't many advertisements and it's very very fun. I recommend this version to all.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I think this is a good CD for Adele fans.  It showcases her songs and music with a few of her hits that I love and also some songs  I like from seeing her on PBS.  All in all a very good CD
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game but because it's free they are a lot of advertisements which come on between every level or so so it's a little annoying but not so much. Download it.
1476712042|5.0|This novel made me laugh,broke my heart and captivated me in every way. After I read \\"Beautifuul Disater\\" I read it again immediately because the twist and turns captivated me so much. Great novel!!!I cant wait for the second one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Best game ever but it is free so that means lots and lots of advertisements which can be very annoying at times and I'm not sure if this is because it is the free version but this version can be a little slow and glitchy. If you didn't want to pay the 3 bucks for the alternative then this is good.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Remember when these things used to be relevant to the gaming industry? Man, those were the days. And you cant beat picking them up now for only a penny...
B007N5YIUS|3.0|The original is better, this one is kind of boring and easy. I don't know, I guess if you like angry birds, you'll like this game but I didn't.
0307346609|5.0|Max Brooks managed to do it again. First with the Survival Guide and now with WWZ. From front to back its a great thought experiment into the various dynamics that would effect the world in the event of a global viral outbreak. Not just a zombie thriller, the events of this book could easily be held as a warning to the way the world will react to a real outbreak of some unstoppable and deadly virus that we are yet to stumble into. Its definitely an interesting read that manages to still be entertaining all the way to the end.
0439023521|5.0|I love this book and the entire series but this book is filled with typos! I had to re-read a few sentences to see what Collins was trying to say. If you could get past that then you'll love this book because it's so much better than the movie.
1400049628|5.0|A lot of folks like to ding this book because of its unusual and fantastical subject of a fabled Zombie Apocalypse. Max Brooks couldnt have put together a better blend of satire and seriousness. This is one for the collection folks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am hooked on the story taking place in another reality. Looking forward to the continuation of a love story or a rebellion.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Casting of female as Dr Watson gives whole new meaning to the role and a fresh approach to the whole Holmes genre.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is just so much fun to watch!<br />The characters and costumes are perfect.<br />What an enchanting story!<br />Bring us more PBS
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I cried. I was hooked on the series from the start. Finished the trilogy in four days, I couldn't put the books down.
B0080OJBQW|5.0|I just love anything Adam Lambert!! He is the hottest thing around! I listen to this just about all the time

B009FXIICK|4.0|This game is fun, but I had no idea how to play at first. Once you figure out what the point is, it can be a pretty fun game. My wife is terribly addicted to it. She likes it more than I do. I find it a little boring after a short while, but I understand its appeal.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow... just wow! I LOVED this book! Once I started I couldn't put it down, and I didn't!! Great story. Definitely a must read.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is very well written! Captivating from the beginning. Definately recommend this book to others! Great book for a booo club!
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|The story of August Rush is unique and the music in the movie just as much. I don't want to give a plot summary here, but suffice it to say that this movie will move you. Anyone who loves music will appreciate the musical diversity of the film and the culminating effect it creates. For a good night in, grab some popcorn and feel the music!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is one of my new favorite movies! I just love it. I could watch it over and over again!
B000YHG72E|4.0|This movie is great if you're looking for a pick me up at Christmas time. The plot is well thought out and the acting is very effective at getting humor across to the audience.<br /><br />-1 star for some crude un-intellectual humor
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I am not sure how this won any awards, very unfunny compared to family guy or american dad. I do not recommend it.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I like these so far.  The are very flexible, so no headache worries, the sound is good and the price is unbeatable.  I ordered 3 pair (I am afraid I won't workout in silence).  And some other reviews said they didn't last &#34;forever&#34;, but some other reviewers bought again, so they must be good.<br /><br />The headband is adjustable, the sound is clear, and the price is right.
B004I744AS|5.0|I try to use correct words and find definations very useful. I also enjoy historical information. I have found it useful and entertaining.
B004FEL6GO|5.0|My son loves this toy. It was a little hard to get it to transform the first couple of times that he used but then it seemed to work better.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|This is another well written book from the Vorkosigan Saga.  i love that this one was centered around Mile's cousin instead of Miles
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Have been a Rod Steward fan for MANY years! I really l love this CD. It's perfect to hear his voice set to the tune of lovely Christmas music.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|I gave this recording five stars because it is one of my favorite so far last year and hope the group makes more like this on.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He LOVES IT!!! More than I expected him too. We received it very quickly and decided not to wait until Christmas to give it to him.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|Got this in a timley manner. My husband has really enjoyed it and we look forward to listening to it for years  to come.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was a great book! Action packed, but a little slow at first. I could read the whole trilogy again and again!
034580404X|5.0|In love with this beautiful story that will stay with me forever. Everyone needs to read this! Came in beautiful package and brand new, would buy from them again. Worth buying the trilogy instead of individually, great purchase!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game didn't work for me from the first game.  I had no more options and yet it didn't finish.  It never ended the game.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|i purchased for casual reading after release of the movie this year. started reading but not finished.do plan to read it soon
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't care for the ending...kinda sick and very much overrated.  I don't understand what all the hype is about.  Would hate to think that something like that can become a best seller.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Il Divo is one of my favorite groups. I listen to this cd in my car. Excellent choice of songs
0987300911|5.0|I must get a score 7.0 or 7.5 to enter graduate school. I didn't find a practical book for IELTS. However, I found it. I think it's very useful and practical for real tests. In addition, I could understand every contents of it because this book is written in simple English. As for people who doesn't have enough time for IELTS, I think, this book is very effective. Especially, I recommend to read it before examinees take the real test.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Loved the story, but it was a little hard to follow.  Would have been nice to have an addition that I could flip back through to review. I would recommend the book
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book<br />I can't wait to read the next book<br />Thriller..shocking turn of events in this book..excitement throughout
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The product is great but they could improve the documentation a wee bit. If you use Windows 8 on a desktop or notebook, don't get that version of the product because it isn't fully functional at tis point. Rather install the standard Windows version and get all the functionality.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I tried very hard to like the movie - given the actors involved and the esoteric subject matter.  However, there is the occasional book which does NOT lend itself to movie making.  In this case the links between the stories are so subtle that in a book - you go AHA.  In a movie, it's easy to MISS entirely until a second viewing.  This book is wonderful.  The movie - despite the fine people involved - was not.<br /><br />READ THE BOOK!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I ordered this for my kindle fire and &#34;your gonna love&#34; the length of this cord. You can use your kindle while charging. I highly recommend this item.
145210655X|3.0|Really good art and cute, charming humor.  A quick, pleasant read that will strike a note with Star Wars fans.
B000B8QG22|4.0|I had it recorded on VHS and I liked the movie it brought back alot of memories of that era. I'm glad to have it on DVD and have the closed captioning I desperately need to enjoy it.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This is a great soundtrack that parallels the movie, and has all the great songs from the stage production, plus more.
140131046X|5.0|Lovely heartwarming contrast of two men serving God!!!<br /> Mitch has a very special way of preserving his relationships. So much love!!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Disclaimer: I don't know anything about rap aside from what I personally like. And what I personally like is pretty simple: heavy percussion, great beats I can snap to (don't you judge me. You love to snap just as much as I do and you know it. That's why we spend hours as a child mastering it), and inventive, heartfelt lyrics. Much to my delight, this album has all of those things and more. Listen to Wing$, Same Love, and Starting Over and tell me you don't get chills every time you hear them. Tell me that you can't think of ONE person in your life those lyrics wouldn't apply to. Listen to Can't Hold Us, BomBom, and White Walls and tell me it doesn't get your blood pumping and your body twitching to dance or act out. Listen to all of the songs and tell me you aren't refreshed by the lack of usual rap bulls***: bitches, hoes, titties, big asses, shooting people, and hollow sexing. To the cynical you may find the lyrics too political, too much of a personal platform, too preachy. As if those who love this album would expect anything less from the cynics. To someone that's tired of the same old raps about killing, drugs, and name checking, I hope you give this album a genuine try. It has an essence, a spark, a genuine truthfulness and relatedness that inspires instead of placates/sedates.
B008KE3960|5.0|Fun strategic game. Free, but you will want to upgrade as I did it is just that addicting. I like those tower defensive strategy games though. 4 levels in each map, about 10 maps, gain money to pay for different plains in your group. gain gears to add plains to your group. It's fun, try it its free.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was deep, and I felt like I could relate. Charlie talks about things that really put life into prospective. I am very impressed with this book, and I'm going to watch the movie to compare.
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|From the opening song, Driftin Back, through the last, Neil takes us on a trip. You will enjoy it and do it over and over. You're hooked. Classic Neil!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I actually enjoyed this movie, especially since the hero has my kinda dog! As my title suggests, this was a movie made more for young people than adults. But, it's still a whole lot better than almost any of the films in sci-fi you can watch for free on Amazon Instant Videos that it was well worth the $1.99!And a much better love story than Twilight!
0765325950|5.0|Amazing writing.  Sanderson has become a master bard in his own right filling in the vision of Robert Jordan.  That said, very disappointing in the decision to delay e-book release just to make sure it had a better chance of reaching #1 on some arbitrary list.  With that decision I am sort of glad there won't be any sequels or prequels.  Maybe in 100 years after it becomes public domain, another talented author will pick up and write why it became important for the dragon to be able to manipulate the pattern itself.
B009LY72LQ|2.0|O.K., I know about the weird deal- you get one wig and one pair of shoes (\\"Say whaaat?!\\") and two dolls. I always checked out these sets when in stores, but always balked at the above and the $20.00 price. That is, until Amazon brought the price down to $13.00, and even down to $9.00 the closer it got to Xmas 2012 (I paid the $13.00). Finally, we could check this set out. Here is my data:<br /><br />You get:<br />-1 wig: magenta, long, layered, slightly wavy with bangs and lavender highlights framing face and crown, very soft<br />-2 beautiful heads<br />-2 torsos<br />-2 sets of arms and legs that separate at mid-points<br />-2 plastic, gray ears for wolfie<br />-2 soft plastic, translucent sea green wings for draco<br />-1 polyester sleeveless dress that stays up with crescent moons, monster eyes, and the MH logo skull<br />-1 polyester matching short jacket with pink crescent moons and hole for dragon wings<br />-1 poly halter top that ties at back and has Velcro, green<br />-1 poly matching skirt<br />-1 pair of cool boots with white crescent moon<br /><br />Full moon:<br />-Some pieces snap together easily.<br />-Wig and wings are easy to place.<br />-Parts do not fall off/become loose.<br />-Outfits are cute.<br />-No jewelry to fuss with.<br />-Boots are easy on, easy off.<br />-Dragon body parts are scaly, have leg and arm \\"fins\\", and pretty diamond markings on the left side.<br /><br />New Moon:<br />-Some pieces do not snap easily together.<br />-Our wig's bangs are splayed.<br />-Heads sit a bit high.<br />-Skirt rides up.<br />-No jewelry to fuss with.<br />-Only one wig.<br />-Only one pair of boots.<br />-Ears do not snap into wolf's head- you have to clip them into the hair like barrettes. Difficult for even me, placement is always off, and a portion of the clip shows no matter how hard you try.<br />-Halter is hard to tie, you have to create an impossible-to-untie knot to keep it on.<br /><br />Now that I know all about these types of sets, take it from me- you can live without them unless they go on sale.<br /><br />And Mattel: Shame on you for creating depression due to your cheapness. Whose idea was/is that to not fully deck out these babes? Why torture innocent children and adults who quickly glance at packages with small print (\\"Only 1 wig included\\") before purchasing, never knowing that one doll will prance around bald and shoeless? Yeah, I knew, and I bought this set, but it still stinks. I realized I made a mistake when I saw my daughter's face upon learning that there was only one wig. In the future, it would be nice if you could also include some sheep that can go missing.rom me- you can live without them unless they go on sale.<br /><br />And Mattel: Shame on you for creating depression due to your cheapness.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I had reservations on this book but was well worth the cost.  Great story and gives one much to think about.
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|This was everything I'd hoped for and the best is the remastered video shot on the first So tour. This has the full concert minus the edits that were released on the POV video. The book is a great read and the vinyl was the icing on the cake (say what you will, LPs have better audio *fidelity* - which is NOT the same as noise reduction - than CDs) and from an audiophile's perspective it's the best that you can get.<br /><br />Very happy indeed with this set.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I am in love with Lindsey Sterlings's music. Never been into violin music before but her range and passion fill the heart. Buy it, you will love it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Didn't catch this series until the third season started.  The scenery (especially the house, and the incredible detail that went into making everything look authentic on top of the work of whoever actually owns the real building) drew me in, and the characters got me to stay.
B0063GORYU|5.0|pretty good app being free and all. its good for those times when I'm bored and unlike other games I don't have to wait for a cool down or regain of coins. I just play as long as I want.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For those of us who believe that we experience God within us, and that the deepest revelation of God comes from our life in God in &#34;CONSCIOUSNESS&#34; itself, this beautifully related experience of NDE is received with intrigue and delight.
B001NHNG64|4.0|This is the first Lee Child book I have read.  I saw the movie Jack Reacher and liked the character so I decided to read one of his books.  The book was good ... slow in parts ... fast paced in others ... but gruesome and disturbing in others.  Although I enjoyed the book, the descriptions of torture, the killings, and twisted minds of others is not something I enjoy reading about so I will probably not read another one of his books. I prefer reading to be relaxing escape from the cruel, evil, and disturbing actions of others, some of the disturbing scenes in this book haunted me.  I like suspense and action but not with twisted, gruesome and disturbing evil mixed in.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Don't care for this particular bingo blitz.  I don't get into facebook, therefore, this game is not for me.  It is for the younger crowd.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I like this game a lot. Keeps me trying to do better and save the babies! One of my top games!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great!.  It is very convenient.  Nice to be able to get weather where relatives and friends live in addition to my own.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|The book is an amazing it had lots of cliff hangers. Although it was sad I still loved it and I could not put the book down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great!!  This is my favorite game of all.  It is interesting and challenging.  It is a great tool for entertainment.
0316069434|4.0|This is a really nice addition to the Harry Bosch series. I enjoyed it a lot. There is a point thought where Harry needs to just go with the flow although I doubt that will ever happen.
B000002QWD|5.0|&#34;White Christmas&#34;<br /><br /> We had this album when I was a kid.  I wanted to get it again on CD, and am not dissapointed.
0553582038|5.0|At first I did not like this book because it was missing many of my favorite characteres. It turns out they all turn up in book five which I am now reading. I understand why he did it but it was confusing at first. Read it. It keeps getting better...
0893860468|5.0|This is NOT just a book, this is an inspiration to turn inwards, to look, to examine and to realize your true self. However, reading of the book by itself is not enough, success is driven by your earnestness to follow the path that Maharaj ji lays out.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have met Marcus Luttrell (after I read this book), and so I may be biased.  However, when I read the book, I literally couldn't wait till the next opportunity when I could read more of it.  The &#34;couldn't put it down&#34; syndrome.  That NEVER happens for me.<br /><br />This book also gave me a great pride in knowing our military seeks out and produces super heroes like Marcus, and his story demonstrates the human ability to overcome.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|I first saw this performance, broadcast live from the Met, on PBS sometime in the 1980's and was utterly enthralled with the music and the cast, and I thought then that it just might be the perfect opera to introduce a person to who might be inclined to think that opera would never work for him or her.  After seeing this remastered DVD rendition, I still think the same.  La Cenerentola is a story that everyone knows (it's the Cinderella tale).  The love story between the prince and Cinderella is played straight while just about everything else is played as comedy.  A great mix that really works!  Frederica von Stade is alluringly beautiful in the lead role (her unexpected unveiling at the Grand Ball is quite moving), the Prince is compellingly ardent, and especially funny are Don Magnifico and Dandini.  The acting is superb and all of them are in great voice with Rossini's orchestrations, as always, full of color and energy.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find that it is now available, remastered, on a DVD.
B002RHGYOA|2.0|I was really disappointing with this book. After watching the film 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' I was expecting a good story at least. I never found out.The style was so predictable and boring I didn't read beyond the first few chapters. Waste of money :(
B007V4LKRU|5.0|Clockwork Angels is by far the best of all the concept albums that the band has created but is there a continuation to the story?  The album begins with the tolling of a bright sounding bell which is then drowned out by a mysterious sound and then a very rush rock sound that continues snakes and arrows becomes present.  According to the story that explains the tracks, a young man is ready for journey and is “thinking big.”  It should be noted that no other concept album is as extensive in how the story is fleshed out.  And if you are concerned that the sound will not be impressive then settle your heart, for the variety of sound that is the concert of Clockwork angles is both delightful and surprising.<br /><br />The sound that begins the album is certainly an important element that should not be dismissed.  Longtime fans of Rush will recall the significance of the bell in Losing it from Signals.  This is mentioned because here to we will be tracing the life of a character who reaches a stage of life that is much past his prime.  In this adventure the character is not doomed to suffering though.  Instead the sound of most of the songs and lyrics are pointed towards passing down knowledge as evidenced in Wreckers and The Garden.<br /><br />Fans will enjoy that much like the message from closer to the heart Neil has pointed us all to improving the world around us and yet he has not shied away from the harsh truths that were raised in Grace Under Pressure, Roll the Bones, Test for Echo and Snakes and Arrows in BU2B.  And the character is wrought with angst in B2BU2 which makes The Garden such a wonderful closing track.<br /><br />Before commenting directly on The Garden, the opening tacks of Clockwork Angles, in particular the track of the same name, are some of the most passionate tracks and continues to capture the wide-eyed nature that pervades The Fountain of Lamneth.  In contrast to that track and its emphasis on the individual, Clockwork Angels shifts focus to capture something more than just the life we live in trying to attain something monumental.<br /><br />The Garden is a capstone to the philosophical work of the band so far.  The track opens with a harmonious arrangement of strings, which is only a smooth transition from Wish Them Well thanks to the calm chorus and balanced vocals, and the message is also meaningful in the context of the album because it again is talking about a vile truth about life, that limited time and the presence evil in the world are constants, but does so in clam way that is worth lauding Geddy Lee the title Artist and Neil Peart again the role of Professor.<br /><br />The trio’s collaborative focus is what makes these compositions so enjoyable and the messages ever deepening.  The disconcerting element that one can be left with after listening to the album is that the final note is so beautiful and emanates from a cello that is not by the hand of any of the three primary musicians.  One may wonder if it is merely an apt conclusion to the best work the band has created or if the resounding note of resolution is signaling the end of what the band has lived and created with the hope they have given enough.o capture something more than just the life we live in trying to attain something monumental.<br /><br />The Garden is a capstone to the philosophical work of the band so far.

B004I744AS|2.0|I love words and word games, so I was glad to see this has optional word games on the homepage. I'll begin my critic there...<br /><br /> 1. Spelling Bee- this game has 3 levels of difficulty, it gives you a definition and you enter the word. I like a challenge, but when the definition is the 2nd or 3rd meaning, it really takes the fun out of trying to earn points. And there really didn't seem to be any difference between easy, hard or difficult...this would definitely not be a game you could entertain your children with at the dentist.<br /><br />2. Hangman, Same game we all know and love, but considering the difficulty of the first game, it gets boring pretty quickly. I played maybe 50 times and had many words solved simply by selecting all the vowels, I only missed 5 or 6 of words. This is not a word game I would generally gravitate to, so to have this outcome suggests it's pretty easy.<br /><br />3. Words in a word- Same game we all know, it gives you the number of approved words the dictionary recognizes and you try to find them all. Again, 1/2 of the words are so obscure, unless you are a Word Master, there is no way you can win. Also the configuration used to display your answers quickly fills the small space..I'm using a kindle...after about 20 words you can no longer see your previous answers, and the way it handles a correct 2nd entry of a word is to just let it go thru, so you have to constantly reposition the screen. When you are dealing with 100+ words, it's an aggravation issue.<br /><br />4. Thesaurus- You choose which words in a list, share the same definition. Again, very obscure words.<br /><br />Now to the dictionary itself, my first issue is, when it asks you for the language you want to use, the only English version is denoted with a British flag...it seemed to lack some American language words although, I just purchased it yesterday, and only checked for slang...it does seem to be more UK leaning.<br /><br />2. When you enter a word to look up, it creates a list...which also seems to pick up some of the words from the word games...there is no way to delete or trash the words this list creates...it's just another  step to navigate through when looking up a word. I find this feature annoying.<br /><br />3. There is advertising at the top of each definition page. I guesswork it's free, you have to expect it...<br /><br />4. The definitions are expansive...there is s huge amount of information offered for each word...and honestly, the first definition sort of gets lost on the page.<br /><br />Lastly, I was extremely disappointed this morning to find all of the methods used to bring up the keyboard were frozen...Again, there is no directions to tech support, or FAQ' s...so I shut down and rebooted maybe 5 times and they worked.<br /><br />So for 2 days it use, this is what I found, good and bad. Overall I think you get your monies worth...there is a vast amount of information provided...if you like to spend time with a dictionary, and have several sources of information in a single app; if you enjoy learning the most obscure words, and their definitions...this is for you. If you just want a no frills, concise dictionary...I would keep looking.it creates a list...which also seems to pick up some of the words from the word games...there is no way to delete or trash the words this list creates...it's just another  step to navigate through when looking up a word.

B0086700CM|5.0|love playing this....will tell all my friends to get this...I think everyone should have this game. it is very addictive
B003E8P9G0|5.0|As always, Rick has blown me away again. I loved it and hope for more books! Thank you Rick Riordon
0547260695|5.0|The Little Prince is my little brother's favorite book and I managed to get this before he found out about its release. Needless to say it was a huge hit. This is the most beautiful pop-up book I have ever seen. Each pages pops are ingenious and interesting. This already amazing story really comes to new life in this wonderful edition, buy it right now!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Enjoyed reading this book easy reading with little twist at the end. Would have liked to have found out more about picturesque he got off the boat however.
B008G12ERC|3.0|Since I discovered them, Muse has become one of my favorite bands.  Getting the extremely uneven 2nd Law inspired me to sing the praises of their other, better albums before reviewing this album, since though the others are also uneven, every one of their earlier albums adds up to greatness overall.<br /><br />First of all, if you're gonna get into Muse, you must understand two things:<br /><br />1) Their songs basically fall into two categories: songs about bad love, and rousing calls to revolution.<br />2) You've heard of \\"over the top\\"?  As far as I can tell, Muse feels the top is something one is perpetually trying to get over.  Each CD thus produces a new top to strive to get even farther over.  Relax; it's just one of the many delights of listening to their music, along with utterly unexpected genres, outrageous vocal acrobatics, and occasionally stumbling across remarkably effed-up lyrics (see \\"Megalomania,\\" \\"Hysteria,\\" \\"Undisclosed Desires\\" ... well, a whole bunch of them).<br /><br />Yes, you will hear lots of elements of Queen, and opera in general.  You will be struck by their truly amazing musicianship and passion.  You will get to enjoy a jaunty clarinet solo in \\"I Belong to You\\" (from The Resistance), a flamenco interlude in \\"City of Delusion\\" (from Black Holes and Revelations), and spectacularly dramatic church organ in \\"Megalomania\\" (from Origin of Symmetry).  \\"Dark Shines,\\" also from Origin of Symmetry, features him pounding on a piano tunelessly like a little kid--but it works!<br /><br />I don't really get all the \\"Muse goes dubstep\\" reviews of The 2nd Law.  In terms of its sound, this album seems to me like a natural progression from previous album The Resistance.  Origin of Symmetry pretty fully explored what a rock trio can do with drums, bass, guitar, and vocals, plus keyboards and other creative instrumentation, but it was, at its heart, a rock album.  Absolution stretched from there into richer instrumentation--lots of piano, synthesized instruments, and a bigger sound.  Absolution sounded to me as if a recording studio couldn't hold their sound anymore--they had developed into more of a stadium sound.  This proceeded to Black Holes and Revelations, which has soundscapes that sound almost as big as a city: galloping horses, orchestras, a sweet and twisted multi-harmony lullaby, and downright bizarre instrumentation (is that a saw I hear?).<br /><br />They had obviously been heading toward more and more synthesized instruments all this time.  With The Resistance, I felt that this transition was essentially complete.  Matthew Bellamy can rip it up with the best of them on the guitar and piano and continues to on every album, but with The Resistance, I felt they had completely moved away from that rock-trio sound into heavily produced, mainly synthesized arrangements.  Please note: I don't consider this a bad thing at all.  I like any genre and combination of instrumentation, as long as it works, and on The Resistance, it works wonderfully.<br /><br />Thus, the highly synthetic sound of The 2nd Law doesn't surprise me a bit.  I love the looped vocals and synthesized bassline of \\"Madness.\\"  The passion and operatics and great production and songwriting that made the other albums great are still there (at least, on this song).  It pleases me to see they're finding new tops to get over.<br /><br />One thing this album lacks (as so many modern albums do) is dynamics; basically it goes from loud to louder.  I finally had to turn the thing off after a few songs, because it was so exhausting to listen to.<br /><br />So yes, \\"Madness\\" is excellent.  \\"Panic Station\\" is funky, fun, and characteristically outrageous.  \\"Supremacy\\" can be fun, if you're in the right mood.<br /><br />I guess the impression I'm left with of 2nd Law is like they got overexcited and overshot their goal.  As a musician myself, I've seen that when you get excited about something, sometimes you aim so high that you can lose sight of the ground.  Muse has found a platform to express their political views (all those calls to revolution), and as they gain popularity, more people will hear them, but before all else, an album must come down to the quality of the songs themselves, and I'm just not hearing it as I did on their previous albums--to the point it kind of ruined their earlier work for me for a little while.  The first four songs are pretty good, but argh, \\"Survival\\" is terrible.  (I liked what Entertainment Weekly had to say about it, under \\"worst singles of the year\\": 'You know your Olympics anthem is in trouble when the Phantom of the Opera, Cookie Monster, and the ghost of Freddie Mercury are all like, \\"Whoa, dudes.  Maybe rein it in a little?\\"')  A most amusing review, but my problem with it isn't the theatrics nearly as much as the pound-you-over-the-head simplistic lyrics (\\"fight!  fight!  win!  win!\\"  NO) and the fact that though it's very, uh, unignorable, it's also just ... not fun to listen to.  I've always loved the unapologetic drama of their songs, but with this CD it seems deliberate and self-conscious, rather than their simply doing what they felt like doing whatever anyone might say about it; thus it comes off as less an album than a stunt.<br /><br />Starting, then, with \\"Survival,\\" the CD takes a sharp downturn.  The following four songs--\\"Follow Me,\\" \\"Animal,\\" \\"Explorers,\\" and \\"Big Freeze\\"--suffer from similar problems--terrible, dreadfully obvious lyrics (\\"kill yourself and do us all a favor,\\" from \\"Animal,\\" a song about Wall Street ... ?  \\"This planet's overrun/there's nothing left for you or for me\\" from \\"Explorers\\" ...?  Cringe ...) and a lack of feeling.  The songs are very busy, but they sound like soapbox speeches, not heartfelt creativity.<br /><br />Chris Wolstenholme wrote and sang the next two songs (Bellamy wrote and sang the rest).  \\"Save Me\\" is pretty, but not something I'd seek out to listen to, and \\"Liquid State\\" is rockin', but again, unmemorable.<br /><br />The2nd Law ends with what seems now customary, after the lovely 3-part symphony that closed out The Resistance: more classical-sounding arrangements (though in this case, it sounds more like soundtrack music than a symphony).  This time, it's voice-overs of pointed, unsubtle news reports and wailing that counts on a level of sustained interest unearned by what's come before on this crappy album.  Nonetheless, aside from \\"Madness,\\" \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" is one of the prettiest, most genuinely emotional songs on the album, musically speaking, and one of the only songs I actually enjoy hearing.<br /><br />So, here's hoping Muse finds their way back to performing music instead of sermonizing and grandstanding.
B0037AGASG|5.0|My granddaughter doesnt just like him, she LOVES him! (but dont tell anyone!)<br />It plays in my car often! (I dont mind)
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|The trailer for this movie was very funny.  Save your time and money and just watch the trailer! Two hours I will never get back!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is the first movie my granddaughter ever laughed AND cried over!<br />She was 7 when she saw it and she LOVED it, so I bought it for her and her sisters for Christmas. There was too much fighting, but the men never got hurt and were able to turn from fighting to buddies over and over. I think it's a guy thing. In fact, this movie is probably good for both genders as both will laugh!<br />(I dont think its appropriate for children under 5 and some young children may lose interest in the story line).
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book. Loved it and couldn't put it down. Will recommend it to everyone. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Its one of the best animated Batman films i have seen in a while. Everyone should check this out for real.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Love historical novels and this was super!  Slavery had been connected with the Civil War for me and this really brought to light the situation with indentured servants.  Great read I highly recommend.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|We are thrilled to have this complete collection of the Columbo TV series.  Wonderful to savor every episode anew and witness our beloved Peter Falk solve the mystery in his inimitable way.  Kudos to a superb ensemble of actors, screen writers, director, etc.  Don't miss buying this series if you enjoyed Columbo on TV - you won't regret it.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I love Nicholas Sparks books/movies.  I seriesously thought this book would rank right up there w/the Notebook, A Walk to Remember, or A message in a Bottle, but it did not.  This book, was very predictable until the ending about Jo.  Here's hoping the movie is better....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the whole trilogy. I found the main characters to be intriguing, endearing and believably complicated. I found myself wrapped up in the  story, really wanting to see what would happen next. By the end I just wanted to spend more time with the characters. I feel the trilogy has been unfairly typecast as a soft core porn or a book about bondage. It is neither of those things. It is a great love story which happens to have some kinky details. At any rate, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will look forward to any future books written by EL James.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This movie is a hit.  It offers a good plot line and characterization, without being a rip off of the Stallone film.  If you like or need to see a good action adventure, then Dredd is the one.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I am new to this series.But this is TOTALLY cracking me up!I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good scence of humer!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Didn't want to put it down! Loved it!!<br /> Kept me on my toes about what was going to happen next
B009H442DG|5.0|Heard about this new CD from Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta - What a pair, since Grease, one of our daughters all time favorites.  Had to get a copy of the CD for our daughter as well as ourselves.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I think this is a great soundtrack.  Love the icloud. Its on my iphone, kindle, and computer. The movie was great.
B00001ZWTT|4.0|Richard got to shopping on Amazon first and enjoyed picking out a few movies for himself.  This is one of his favorites.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good books. I just wish it wasnt so drawn out and really over fantasized. She did do a really good job on her research.
B00005JKZ3|4.0|Finally started my holiday shopping on line this year.  Saved me a lot of steps to the stores and the malls this year.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|If you think you bought it but it wont download and you cant find it on  your Kindle  then it usually means it isnt accepting your payment. You did not buy the app. It only looked that way.
0307744434|5.0|I ended up having to purchase a copy for my son and now he is purchasing a copy for his girlfriend. Its one of those rare reads that when you finish reading it, your mind starts listing all the people you know who would love reading it too. A simple but compelling plot drives The Night Circus through the twists and turns of years with artfully worded details that skillfully provide the perfect balance between character development and story progression. The characters (including the Circus itself) lead you through the tale instead of their personalities being lost in the action.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is really great even though you run out of coins its all in how you play and stratigically put the coins. I love this game it helps me to relax.<br /><br />would definitely recommend.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is best program for ideas, inspriation and fun ever!  I refer back to my boards all the time.  Great way to organize and keep an idea file for anything!
B0081X8AE6|5.0|This is great albulm. If you like real music you should buy it. I heard one track off of it on the radio and went out on a limb and bought it. There are multiple tracks that are GREAT on it.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time without a doubt! Roy is the man! This is a must see!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Lots of great tracks on this albulm. Fans of Mumford & Sons should also enjoy this. I like this better than Mumford & Sons.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I enjoyed the varied use of the violin. The blend of classical tones with fast past aggressive patterns. My son heard the music and became very interested with the artist.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Another emotional book on living life through the easy and the difficult.  Comiserating with the main character was easy.  The author expresses the characters feelings in a way that I felt myself walking in her shoes.
B002OSXDAU|3.0|Yesterday I finished reading The Fountainhead. It's my first Rand book; I've heard more about Atlas Shrugged but wanted to read her first book first.<br /><br />I have rather mixed feelings about this novel. I love the message as I thought I would. Other reviewers I'm sure have covered that aspect of the book adequately so I won't get into it here. I loved it because it spoke to me, my experiences in life so far, and deals with a topic so rarely addressed.<br /><br />My gripe is with the more mundane stuff--her writing. If I had a penny for every appearance of the word \\"bromide\\" or \\"whom\\" I'd be posting this review from a luxury resort somewhere. The book is 70 years old and it shows it the stiff writing style.<br /><br />Rand also fails to give the characters any real depth with the possible exception of Ellsworth. For a novel about a topic so near to the author's heart (and presumably many of her readers) this makes reading it a dull experience. Only the continuous pace of the story kept me going.<br /><br />And lastly this is an unnecessarily wordy book. Rand loves to spend a page or two on something that only requires a paragraph. Only when you've dug through 80 percent does the story become interesting. Rand seems to love writing but not storytelling.<br /><br />Still I recommend this book (with the above caveats) but perhaps only because I haven't read Atlas Shrugged yet. Look for that review in a bit--I understand it's an even longer book.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|The only reason I don't rate it a 5 is that sometimes it won't open.  The graphics are great and smooth.
B0019N95IK|5.0|OK, I was smart enough to wait to buy the original DVD Enterprise sets at pawn shops for about $25 each. I enjoyed the series a LOT, and even my wife liked them. So the years go by, and I convert my entire DVD collection to Blu Ray, and wait for the Star Trek stuff to come out. Finally TOS comes out on Blu Ray, and I bought them 1 season at a time. Woops...then they release all 3 for much less. Fool me once.<br /><br />So when I see Enterprise FINALLY coming out on Blu Ray for a whopping $84, I jumped at it, then had second thoughts. $84?? Really? I've never paid that much for ANY Blu Ray series...EVER. Why is this one different? I don't know, but I do know that I will not buy them individually. I'll wait for the complete series. Fool me once shame on Paramount. Fool me twice, shame on me.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|My kids like this movie alot.  It is cute and funny.  It has good guys, bad guys and smart children.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Those who like nonograms and the sort will definitely enjoy this one. I got this game as the free app a while back. I played a few levels but got bored with quickly and uninstalled. I recently installed it again to give it another chance. I am glad I never fully deleted from my account!<br /><br />It is well worth the actual price as it contains over 200 puzzles which will require hours of gameplay before finishing. For those debating  between this one or FlipPix version, do not hesitate and get this one. This is so much better! I would gladly pay $4.95 for quality puzzles vs the FlipPix version which I do not even want as free. Here we get a finished product that actually is a picture vs colored boxes that are supposed to a picture but in reality is not.<br /><br />If you like challenging puzzles that also have quality this is your pick! Keep them coming!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This move is great.  The kids enjoy it and so do the grownups.  A movie for all ages!  (Yes sad at the beginning but overall a good show.)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|At first I was hesitant to get this app back when it was the free app of the day because, well, it looked stupid and boring.... seriously, how good can an app where you have to draw a stick man be??? Apparently very good!!!<br /><br />After reading reviews and watching the video I decided to get it. It was free at the time anyway. Well, it turned out to be a very good game. The stickman becomes alive and you take it to a journey. Once you complete a stage it will unlock the next. Some levels have multiple solutions thus opening different stages as well.<br /><br />A game that can be played at any age. My mother, sister, niece and myself have all become players. Ranging from ages 6-50. Kudos to the developers!
0446580848|2.0|I remember John Corey being a wise ass in The Lion, but he wasn't quite such a boring, one-track wise ass. In The Panther, all you get is an endless loop of sarcastic remarks about Yemen, Al Qaeda, Yemenis, and his fellow operatives on the team. Endless. It's as if DeMille had an idea for a great short story, and he stretched it into a book. I plodded through it but if you want to skip pages...lots of pages...in order to get to what finally happens be assured that you won't miss anything.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I am glad to say I got it as the free app of the day but well worth the price. Provides hours of entertainment as you try to solve each level. Some levels seem to be unsolveable but after hard thinking and dedication you see that is not the case. In one case I gave up on a stage but a friend of mine found the solution. Good game to play with others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This really was a great book. Nothing too complicated and nothing overdone. Simple, fun, good read. I really enjoyed it.
B002TK78HC|5.0|Fast shipping in wonderful condition love Ozzy and it was pretty cool to find this LP I had it in high school. Walking Dow memory lane.
B007MG360G|5.0|I mean this is the best game ever it download fast a lot of animals and the cure ducklings a're so cute
1451695187|5.0|What makes this book so interesting is that it it describes a near death experience that is unusual.  Dr Alexander for some reason did not experience any kind of judgement of his earthly life which for some reason he could not remember while he was in coma that was the result of his illness.  He discovered however in this state that I was a citizen of a universe that was staggering in its vastness and complexity and ruled entirely by love.'  It seems to me that every person should read thiks book.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|This album was so reasonably priced compared to iTunes, they wanted $13, I paid $5 for this album!! I love every song.
B001J4E1D8|5.0|See above.  I believe I would enjoy it and regret anyh aspersions that a low star rating might have given it.  I just have not had time to watch it.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|It is very draining to be left on so it has to stay plugged. &#62;_&#60; &#62;_&#60; &#62;_&#60; &#62;_&#60; &#62;_&#60; &#62;_&#60;
B003JXUXPW|5.0|I heard this song on a local jazz station one evening.  I'd never heard of Gregory Porter but liked his voice (deep, smooth and mellow).  His music is nice to listen to on a lazy day or to wind-down from a busy work week.  This cut is slightly up beat....in the same vane as Louis Armstrong's &#34;What a Wonderful Day&#34;.  I've downloaded other cuts from GP and they are just a nice!
B007HACDLK|5.0|As always, Vince really did an excellent job with Mitch, Stan and Irean. Great plot real world danger. Vince when is your next book coming out? Can hardly wait!
B00178JDCK|3.0|it's so so just too much like a robot trying to do ballet!!! price is good in a pinch you can find 1 or 2 useable rev's
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I really love Tina Fey; from her smile to her humor, she just makes me laugh. Excellent read! Will be gifting this to friends.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a heart warming story of an unloved, spoiled little girl that moves to England after her parents die to live with her uncle, discovering a new world, a mysterious cousin, and a garden that she believes is dying. She and her new animal-charmer friend, help to wake up the garden, and change forever herself and her cousin.
0307943259|5.0|I've read everyone of John's books and find myself thinking each of them is a creative writing exercise. This last one is brilliant, and the Audible narrator, J.D. Jackson, does a perfect job with each of the characters. The book starts off a little slow with character development as some of the Grisham books can do, but as the book starts building steam you realize it's to the readers benefit. This is no exception.<br /><br />I have one comment, which is after watching the documentary, \\"The Wild and Wonderful White's of West Virginia\\" this week while in the middle of reading the Racketeer, it's easy to make several comparisons, almost as if John used this documentary as a base for his book. The prison angle, Appalachian culture, the generational drug dealing, and even naming one of the characters D Ray. If anyone else has had the opportunity to take in both the movie and book, I would like to hear others thoughts on this also.<br /><br />Documentary Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VWC4BW/ref=...
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Have watched it several times now. Have to get use to the British axcent. Shipped same day as ordered, GREAT SERVICE as always. Packaged OK, no problems.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Nice design, I like the scrollable cheese bar to revert the trail.  Only negative there is if you want to adjust the trail closer to the cheese, you have to wipe out the whole length from the mouse.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Quite a preformance by Jamie Bell, great movie, can this boy dance. A MUST see movie, great for the whole family over 13 years of age.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I usually try and read books before I see the movie based on this book, didn't happen this time. I loved the movie so I had to read the book,I'm definitely a big believer that books are always better than the movie even when the movies are spectacular. This held true once again
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is an Oldie but Goodie. It brings back memories that I thought were forgotten and it also gives me new thoughts.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Quality was great I enjoyed the book and it made me feel as if I was there great book! I would recommend it!
B008UFUOH6|5.0|For a different take on seasonal music this is hard to beat - a thoughtful and melancholy collection of pared down arrangements showing Tracy Thorn's vocals at their best.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The  author successfully paints vivid pictures of the characters and the landscape.  I  could not  put it down.  I can not  wait to start the last book.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|Music that I like. Clapton with his early blues etc is great. Slowhand is giving me the music I prefer listening to.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Being able to find meaning in suffering... very interesting to read! Thinking that only through suffering we are able to find meaning in are lives is something I felt strongly about but after reading this book, that true meaning to are lives doesn't necessarily have to come from suffering and isn't any less meaningful. I'm glad I read it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Very well written.  Fast read.  Difficult topic but put not depressing.  Actually takes a step into the lives of people with issues I never considered.  It really makes you consider life and what is truly important.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was a well written story that left you guessing, which is my favorite part about it.  If we could all experience a first kiss like that!  WOW!  Loved it!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|At first I thought this game would be like many other boring waiting games, but boy was I wrong. It has a very fun and addicting strategy element in it and anyone reading this won'be disappointed when they play this. it does bug out a bit, but all you have to do is restart it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was really looking forward to this book after reading Slammed and Point of Retreat, but this was even better!!! Beautifully written, gripping novel!!! Loved it!!
B009O2XY12|3.0|Easy game, would be a great game for kids. Even young children could get this game. Easy to pass the time away
B009UWYFFK|3.0|blu ray - video quality - 5/5<br />audio quality - 5/5<br />movie - 3/5<br /><br />blu ray is great, but the movie itself could have been a lot better.<br />great for kids, but just ok for thinking adults.<br />madagascar and toy story still entertained adults, but this one just didn't<br />do anything for me.<br />if you have kids get it on blu ray, otherwise it's just good as a rental
B0016K40KY|5.0|I'd recently taken in this epic on the big screen at a local theater as part of the 50th anniversary redux with 4G technology. I left the theatre feeling like I had the Arabia sand in my shoes -- stellar stuff.
B005VPRETE|5.0|It was a great Christmas gift for my niece who raved about it! It exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it to any aunt that wants to make her niece happy :)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|in this puzzle you need to merge  the blobs just right to end on top of all three stars for a perfect score.
B005XN31LY|5.0|We missed several episodes of Once Upon a Time because other programs interfered with it being recorded. I was glad to be able to catch up on them.
B005AERS74|2.0|I really like Maroon 5 but this CD is definitely not a hit. I could listen to all songs and kept skipping the musics.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I missed seeing the first season of Game of Thrones when it aired, so I was glad to be able to get it here at a good price.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|This is a must have MP3 CD. I loved Maroon 5 and this was in my opinion their best work.
B008CJ0KI8|1.0|I am not familar with this artist.  I purchased it for my Daughter-in-Law.  She loves the CD, and was very happy and surprised to receive this gift.
B00004VWA7|4.0|This is the ground-breaking 1976 album from Jaco Pastorius, the genius manic depressive who rewrote the book of what was possible with the electric bass guitar.<br /><br />Pastorius' eclectic style might be classified as jazz but incorporates 1970s funk plus ballads and latin rhythms. His music is difficult to pigeon-hole because more than anything else, it's his own style of playing which shines: fast, inventive, melodic and of awesome virtuosity, he placed bass guitar at the centre of the band and used it as a lead instrument. If you're an aspiring musician and have never heard Pastorius' playing, just listen to this and be blown away.<br /><br />Pastorius always used a fretless bass for recording and on stage but practiced regularly with a fretted instrument, \\"because the strings eat the neck up\\". He is joined here by Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Lenny White and a host of top-flight jazz musicians (as many as 10 musicians surround Jaco and attempt to keep up with him) and the result is astounding. However on a couple of tracks - the stunning opener `Donna Lee' and `Portrait of Tracy' - Jaco basically plays solo, supported on `Donna Lee' only by the congas of Don Alias.<br /><br />This release contains 2 previously unheard bonus tracks: an alternate take of `Cha-Cha', and `6/4 jam' both of several minutes' duration.<br /><br />It has been said that Jaco Pastorius was the last jazz musician of the 20th century to make a major impact on the world at large, so radically did he re-define the musical landscape. His tragic death in 1987 aged 35, following a violent attack by a nightclub bouncer (who later pleaded guilty to manslaughter) was a serious loss to music, but he left behind one heck of a legacy and is revered by genuine musicians everywhere.
1452101248|5.0|this book is fabulous. if i actually planned what i bought and followed the recipe i'm sure i'd love it - but many of the ingredients are pretty unique/specialty. i find it a really great book to flip through to inspire me in a direction. the publishing is fabulous and i pick it up more than any other book on the shelf.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The context of the story- the upstairs story/downstairs story was genius! Without it, this would just be another mildly appealing saga, but one I probably would have stopped watching long ago. And it just keeps getting better!
B00936A0RU|5.0|This movie is really a good movie to watch if you like boot leggin, and prohibition, plus it also has gun fights fast cars and great actors!  EXCELLANT
B005LAIGN2|5.0|I got this for my husband who is a history buff.  He loved it.  he gave us all a history lesson while we watch it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app. I like the big button, don't have to squint to see them. Don't have any issues with it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good book. It really kept me interested. Collins really painted a picture of what was going on in the book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing book! It encompasses all emptions possible in a book. Colleen Hoover is a great writer who really knows how to draw you in from the start of the story and hold you until the very last sentence.
B002BWP49C|5.0|If you are a Twilight Fan you will be utterly happy to own it because no one Twi-Fan will have waited for it to be released on DVD to see it.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|For us this movie was a waste of time. A few funny parts, wish it was hilarious, but it was not.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love love love her and her music. She's amazing! Wish a couple of the songs she did for games were on it but no complaints, she's great!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|My wife is a runner...this was the perfect Christmas gift.  It syncs your run times and calories...all your info...right to your computer for tracking!!  Durable...this is her second!
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|My favorite song \\"On My Own,\\" performed by Samantha Barks, is cut off at the end, and is finished on \\"One more Day.\\"  This sucks when you're not listening to the album completely, or on shuffle.
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|Fun quick read. Great way to spend a rainy Sunday. Good stories, ready for the next books and to see how the series progresses.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|did not live up to the full potential that the proceeding books gave hope for, the Author had potential to lead us to a grand finale but simply wrapped it up, crossed a few T's and dotted the I's
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I actually sat down and had a marathon watchibg this series as I wanted to get to the third season..<br />What a fabulous fabulous show....so addictive you cannot wait to see what happens next.
B008Q09K2U|3.0|the overall story line was great but the climax lacked suspense and good ideas basically everyone packed up and went home when the book reached a suitable size
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Its the complete Star Wars saga on blu-ray! What could be better?!?! I'm a long time fan of the series so this was the perfect Christmas present.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|can't wait for the final book, Lets hope there is a finale equal to the beginning, A great concept for a film
1421550644|5.0|I purchased this manga since I'm a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki's works, the price was good too. The story of Nausicaa in the manga is much explained and detailed more than the movie which will help you understand a lot of things that weren't clear in the movie version, also this manga is much longer than the movie, it has many scenes that will happen after the movie with much more characters. Very Recommended to Ghibli fans!
B0082Z1CVQ|3.0|when I originally read this as a child of 6 or 7, I really liked it. Rereading it now I find I am disapointed. Everything I remember is still there, but I now notice the preachyness of the book that didn't bother me as a child.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very sturdy and well built knife!  Would highly recommend this to add to your survival gear! A little bigger than I thought, but I love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like all the games.Very addictive and enjoyable to play I got twevle games to play and they were lots of fun.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|My preschooler and i play this together! We love it! Great price with lots to do. A bunch of different animals to explore.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book had a good plot with lots of surprises. Once I got into it , it was hard to put down .
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun for everybody, even my Grammie got in on the game! We made a competition of it. It's tough, but very enjoable.
0385751532|4.0|My daughter read this book for her 10th grade English class and loved it. She passed it on to me afterward with the warning of \\"it's very sad\\". Sad in an understatement, but this is a powerful story.<br />This is a quick read, a day book, but I would recommend it to readers of all ages. Certainly it's a work of fiction, but it's is a quick reminder of the dangers of forgetting history. We are often very different from others when seen from the eyes of an adult, but children have a nose for the truth!<br />Great story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It took me awhile to figure out how to get the guy to go across the screen... ((you have to move the actual kindle)). However, once I figured this out I played for a couple of hours... it was addicting!
0684857219|5.0|Anybody who wants to learn about exercises and physiology, buy this book and read it.  I keep it in my office at work (military) and it comes in handy quite often.
B0009UC810|5.0|A classic film that others have tried to copy but can't match the original.  The soundtrack is the best along with a great cast.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Cute but contrived and using NYC colloquialisms. Plot okay but not great. I like the tv show better. Seems like it was written for a male audience.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|A total waste of time (no pun intended). Story flow could have been better and inconstantcies should have been avoided.
B009C7JS14|3.0|It's okay. There are better weather apps available. Very basic and not what I thought it would be.  Should have researched it more. That's on me.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book. Despite it bouncing around a little it was still very good. I do like the epilogue... how it switches into Christian's perspective... I'd enjoy reading that angle.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Townsend offers insight into a world that is filled with sex, drugs and rock and roll, which he admits is not all its cracked up to be.  He comes across as very practical at times, but then also possesses a less than humble side regarding his place in rock and roll history.  Great inside information concerning his relationship with the other members of the Who and rock and roll royalty.  Great read!
6304712944|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Between the wonderful actors, the story line, the music (especially), this is an wonderful classic....none better!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg this is the best game ever! You can build whatever you want to in creative mode wherever you want to. Just wish survival mode was a little easier(I haven't been playing this game for long) and gave you at least one weapon and one type of infinite building material. Thanks Mojang!
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a great BBC series. Highly recommended if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan. Set in modern day and very well acted.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved the story but hated the ending it just suddenly stops when it's beginning to get good. But I've got to admit the story kept you on your feet
B003TOMAPC|5.0|It's always great to see the basic &#34;heroe beats them all&#34; theme and have a spin put on it. The dark humor was excellent and the villains very hateable. The heroine was a spitfire full of energy, wit, and dedication to the cause of fighting evil. A unique, colorful film, full of action and comic satire.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|It was pleasant reading with the odd good message without requiring any effort from the reader.  It was predictable throughout.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow up to the first book! Absolutely great and well written!  My favorite of all in the series. Kept me on my toes!
B00899DR40|4.0|My 4-year-old and I enjoy listening to Justin Bieber all the time! I take my Kindle anywhere I go, so my daughter can be entertained!
B008TTPQXA|5.0|A fascinating story on a subject that interests me. The story justs seems more cridible as it was wtitten by a specialist who originally was a sceptic.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I couldn't stop reading and lacked sleep for a few days! I purchased the final one right away! Great book!!

B003U74NQW|3.0|if you like david lynch then watch this ...if you dont then dont lol. Im a fan so i had to watch it but it is definately out there.
B000W2742I|5.0|I buy these every year pretty much and give them to music friends who have not listened. This series of songs can astound. Not straightforward construction. Not jazz. But difficult to label. One of my favorite, non-jazz, non-classical albums of all time and it does not seem to fade with age so far.
B004YSDT52|4.0|great little thriller that does the foreign version justice. Great cast, and not a bore. Wondering if you should see it? the answer is Yes.
0988262592|5.0|Every business is in the IT business, regardless of the business that they think they're in. This compelling book provides much needed insight into the inputs and outputs of IT and shows how important the DevOps movement is. Get this book, read it and share it.<br /><br />If you're only going to read one book in 2013 to \\"catch up\\" on DevOps, this is it. It has most of the practices, the historical DNA, and the way of thinking that you need to get a hold of.
B003FL4O9E|5.0|Watch this fun movie so happy 90s had the best movies, best movies, good movies. TMNT is awesome. Review is now over!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I do not allow this program to run all the time as it does not behave well enough on my Android phones to be allowed that freedom.  But, when I need it and launch it, it does work, if cumbersomely.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is excellent when you're traveling. You can be sure of getting to the airport on time. You can adjust the volume to suit yourself.
0375869026|4.0|The writing was okay, but the narrator jumping from character to character was a good idea but the writer overused it, pushing into some characters that were unnecessary.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After watching I heard that I would not have had to pay for it, using pbs.org. Amazon should have extended the same courtesy. Awesome program though, adding benefit to life rather than mind numbing typical options on tv.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really cool. When you run, you keep going until you fall! My point is, you'll never win :]
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love this app. Saves my life!!! There is never enough light for cell calculators. Very accurate.<br />I would be lost paying bills without this program. Thanks kindle
B005FISBTO|5.0|I ordered this a little late as a Christmas gift for my husband, and wasn't sure if it would get here in time, but it did! I was very pleased with the speed of the delivery. It was packaged well and arrived in the shape I expected.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i think it is a really fun and addictive game to do when u are bored just wish i had more coins to begin with
B0068RHSZO|5.0|If you like a good mystery and a movie with a few twists plus a good story, this movie is for you
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It's very difficult to write a book that has a seamless flow. Usually there are sections of even very good books that drag a bit, that you have to endure to get to the payoff. Anthony Ryan has written a novel that manages to be interesting every step of the way. That's quite an accomplishment.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I don't mind a bit of romance, but in this book, there there could have been a bit less of that and a bit more action and intrigue.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|It is an excellent review of a person who has changed the world.  It gives an honest account of the person and his faults do not take away from the accomplishments.  His good qualities and convictions and not so good attributes can be lessons for everyone's life.  It is an inspiration to know about Mr Jobs' life.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I have not viewed these DVDs as yet.  I bought Season 7 because I have all previous six seasons.  Bone is my favorite show on television these days.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Arrived on time and in excellent shape in original packaging. Would definitely recommend it to all.
B00915G6MG|5.0|This is one of my favorite programs.  The characters are lovable, funny, and human.  They care about each other and doing their jobs well.  Their cases are interesting.  Ducky and his expertise is interesting.  These stories and the people are believable.  I never tire of watching.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|This was a gift for Christmas. It arrived in a timely manner in original packaging. This is a excellent family movie for kids 8 or older, especially boys. I would highly recommend it if your child loves the father/son relationship with life size toys involved.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The first full season is probable the funniest season of them all. You will enjoy a few good hours of laughter along with some side splitting comedy from these nerds.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|You'll have to just see it to believe.<br /><br />I'm 47 years old. I normally walk out of animated films which sound too noisy for me.<br />I not only stayed the entire movie. I watched it again 4 times -- alone even, just to experience it again and again.<br />The magic of childhood is the magic of wonder, play, dream, believing. And if you still have that imagination left in you,<br />then maybe you could still sit down, laugh, cry, cheer with your kids while watching this movie.
B0053O8AQE|4.0|A great way to spend a few hours with a couple of good looking ladies laughing and having fun with your family or friends.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I love every one they were great actors the theme was great when will the 3 series be coming out go teen wolf
B004OHV5TU|4.0|Wonderful program  of  classical music. A.  Tharaud is a spectacular pianist  whose style is illustrated on the YouTube  videoes. I fell in love while watching his fingers dance on the keys..
B004UJAOLM|3.0|I am thankful for the kindle dictionary. I have gained some new vocabulary for sure. Once I had discovered the darkness of the book, it was too late to stop reading. It is a compelling story.  How do I give a book that has endured so many years less than a 5? I give it a 3!
B0026P3G12|5.0|What can I say, SuBo is superb.  The CD is excellent.  This is what dreams are made of,  I would recommend SuBo's music / CD to everyone.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|Nicely written account, very honest and a good read. I highly recommend this book.  It is real and an easy read.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel will keep you guessing until the very end.  I can see why it is on the best sellers list.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I have a 3 yr old and a 4 yr old and My kids love it. I would recommend it to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Topical subject that is written so well that you can feel the fear and finally the courage it requires to break the bonds of spousal abuse.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|Kid is awesome. He rocks like always.  He keeps it real and doesn't forget where he came from.....Detroit, Michigan USA
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|The human characters are painful to look at. Did they all really need emo black rings around their eyes, have sucked in faces and behave that wierd to get the point across?<br /><br />Bottom line<br /><br /> Tries too hard to be a dark movie.  Waay too hard, the black and white is overkill and distracting...<br /><br />  Story is predictable, boring and slow. Waste of time imo
B004VMUS9G|5.0|app does just what it is supposed to all the time. sound of the alarm is gradual and enough to wake up by
B008HK3RVY|4.0|I ended up liking this case a lot. However, when I first got it, the case barely fit my iPad mini.  Over time (a month or so) it opened up a tiny bit so that its usable. I love the workmanship and the color, and I don't worry about it scratching going in and out of the case.<br /><br />Padding is ample and I've dropped it from waist level with no effect at all.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B0081HLM2E|2.0|This movie presents a story that has intrigue, surprise, and clever plot twists, but I threw it in the trash.  Unless you like to see people fornicating and full frontal nudity, you won't like this movie either.
1401307787|5.0|the guys got a way of seeing life in a way<br />most people never see it.gives you a real understanding<br />of how to slow down and live here and now and let the future take care of itself

1577314808|4.0|oh eckart is a wizard!!!! he knows what makes the human mind tick.<br />read this and come out a smarter lad
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't know this book would be this amazing. Sure it was about love at first sight, relationship troubles followed by a seemingly perfect romance, but it was so much more. This book was different, it actually had a storyline that wasn't your run of the mill YA romance. This story was so well thought out and it was obvious the author strived to create something special, something different- something hard to do when everyone wants vampires and werewolves right?<br />Colleen Hoover is so good at remembering small details she put into the book and remembering to explain them, even if it's at the end of the book. I had no questions unanswered after reading the ending, this book was just put together perfectly.<br />Sky Davis is no Bella Swan, I'll tell you that, and as much as I loved Edward Cullen, Dean Holder was absolutely the perfect boyfriend/best friend. He cared about Sky do much, and he didn't just love her for how beautiful she was or how great her body was, or those type of things you see nowadays in YA romances, but he loved her for her. Their relationship was not at all \\"Perfect and cookie cutter\\" like they are in books. This wasn't a happy ending for them. This was a great closure and their questions were answered, but by no means was the end of the book a \\"Happily ever after.\\"<br />If you want to read something different, something that is so beautifully written and doesn't have a protagonist that makes you want to gag, give this book a try. Those people who gave it less than 5 stars obviously just don't like books like these. It's no that the book isn't well written or has flaws, it's just that those people can't appreciate something amazing and DIFFERENT.
6305428387|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Glad to have it to play as often as I please. Would love to what  other things the Jamaican actors have appeared in. JMosley
B001CP4VNY|3.0|To be honest, Joel Schumacher's \\"Batman Forever\\" was easy to watch, but difficult to review. It is a fun, enjoyable popcorn movie, with good acting, and fun characters, but just as with the previous Tim Burton films, it falls flat on a narrative level, and the actions of many of the film's characters (including Batman and even his love interest) make absolutely no sense. Still, this is the film that calls back to the most seminal year of my childhood: 1995. Many movies came out that year, and other than Goldeneye (which was an amazing film, and widely under-appreciated)this was the film that I remember the most, and it still for many reasons (including the very beautiful Nicole Kidman) enjoy this film, despite it being a flat, dull, plot hole driven misfire of a movie.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-Val Kilmer's Batman (Not Bruce Wayne)---Val provides an excellent effort, despite him being a choice that no one really thought could play the character. He provides a good dark rendition to the character and a slight vulnerability that had not been seen in Michael Keaton's rendition in the previous Batman films.<br />-Solid musical score--Elliot Goldenthal's music provides a gothic, yet heroic atmosphere, but lacks the iconography that Danny Elfman's had in the previous films<br />-The Batmobile--(despite being completely redesigned, and it would have been cooler to use the original from the Burton films) is decent looking and is very fast<br />--Good use of large sets and real locations (The Ritz Gotham and The Hippodrome Circus are some of my favorite sets from the film itself)<br />Great Acting from Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (despite his character been essentially a cackling maniac with a joker like personality)<br />--Film utilizes a good \\"popcorn\\" movie like aesthetic and atmosphere that makes it enjoyable to watch<br />--Jim Carrey's Riddler/Edward Nygma is well performed--very reminiscent of the late Frank Gorshin from the 1960s series<br />--Good action scenes, good car chases and great stunts and choreography<br />--Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian--she is very sexy, seductive, and feisty; a fun character to watch, and her performance and chemistry with Kilmer's Batman is very appealing--she teases and tantalizes him in a few scenes, which in turn are some of the best parts of the film itself.<br />--Chris O. Donnell's Dick Grayson/Robin is good--O' Donnell gives a tough, hip \\"generation x\\" approach to the character<br />--Schumacher's film makes a good effort to balance the dark and tragic elements from the Batman mythos while managing the kid-friendly, comedic and romantic aspects that the film tries to convey during it's 2 hour and 3-5 minute duration<br />-good visual effects<br />-good bat-suit (very reminiscent of the Len Wain/Neil Adams/Denny O' Neil Comics from the 1970s)<br />-Film makes an effort to mix together and juxtapose its potential plot points to some good effect<br />-Bruce Wayne (at least character wise) has a very public persona which acts in conflict with his duties as Batman<br />(The Burton Films lacked this vital aspect to his character extensively)<br />-Michael Gough's Alfred--once again (and as always the only layer of continuity between films) is excellent with his subtle use of emotion and father-figure aesthetic that he brings to his performance.<br />Favorite Scenes:<br />1.) Dr. Meridian uses the Bat-signal to meet and seduce Batman<br />2.) The Circus Scene--the film's utilizes a nice touch on the whole \\"ripped from the comics\\" origin story on Robin that has now become common place for all comic book films and their characters(the ones that are any good--like the first two Nolan Batman Films that I will eventually get to)<br />3.) The Nygmatech Party--Great fun to watch! Especially when Two-Face and Spice crashes the party and Batman arrives to kick ass, saves Chase, and hooks up with her (briefly)<br /><br />#The Bad#:<br />-Despite playing a very decent Batman, Kilmer's Bruce Wayne Falls flat! he's stale, uninteresting, and lacks the charisma and sarcasm that are essential to Bruce Wayne's character<br />-This film suffers from many of the same problems and plot holes that the Burton \\"Batman\\" films had (including the 1989 original that started the series)<br />-Not much chemistry between Kilmer's Bruce Wayne and Kidman's Chase Meridian<br />-To much emphasis on the stunt casted villains (Carrey and Jones, especially, despite the fact that they work well together)<br />-Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face is a crazed cackling maniac (contrary to the point of the character as a whole)<br />-Commissioner Gordon has nothing to do in this film (as with the previous films) has no function, motivation or purpose to exist in the film at all than to turn on the bat-signal and call out to Batman to respond to a crime in progress.<br />The film cut out some of most important scenes despite many of them explaining why what Bruce Wayne does over the course of the film makes any sense. (especially that great (but deleted) scene when Bruce returns to the section of the cave and confronts the giant Bat that scared him as a child, and thus inspired him to become the Batman)<br />Too Many Plot holes!<br />1.) Why does Harvey want to kill Batman so badly? Batman didn't throw the acid! Salvatore Maroni did!<br />2.) Despite Nicole Kidman's great performance, why is Chase Meridian so in love with Batman? Why does she call him to her apartment at midnight, only to break up with him? (The interesting Romance between them is way too short and unexplained on a narrative level)<br />3.)How does the Riddler know where Two Face is hiding out and is setting up shop within Gotham City?<br />4.)Why does Batman (in the Batmobile) run away from the threat that he was called to respond to?<br />5.)Why does this film open right in the middle of a crisis?<br />6.)Why does Dent Blame Batman for what happened to him when he was D.A. of Gotham City?<br />7.) After Going out of his way to explain to Dick Grayson why killing is wrong, why does Batman toss up the coins and cause the apparent \\"death\\" of Two Face?<br />8.) Why does Harvey flip his coin 6-7 times in order to Kill Bruce Wayne?<br />9.)Why is Batman suddenly okay with the prospect of Robin Killing Two Face?<br />10.) Why are Riddles so easy for Bruce to solve?(any intelligent grade school kid could solve those questions)<br />11.) What happened to all of Harvey's thugs after he falls to his death and Nygma is sent to Arkham Asylum<br />12.) How did Chase Meridian get her credentials as a \\"criminal psychologist\\"? Where did she come from? Where does she go after she leaves Gotham?<br /><br />In addition to the plot holes, the film cuts extremely fast, without explaining its characters, their relationships or motivations throughout its 2 hour and 3 minute duration.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />Despite my many gripes with this film and the several plot holes, and the fact that it suffers from the same problems that previous films had, its still a fun movie to watch. I was throughly entertained, and engaged. I still recommend it a look,  for its great action set pieces as well as the great stunts and acting performances from the ensemble cast(and especially for the nicole kidman scenes, even though her character's actions and motivations made no apparent sense). The Gotham City design was interesting, despite the fact that its bright colors and neon graphics make it appear that this film is not a part of the continuity established by the Tim Burton Films. Still, Nicole Kidman was undoubtedly hot in the movie, and the film as a whole still brings back great memories for me. An entertaining ride, from start to finish.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|A quest of Heroes is a must read. I could not put it down once I started to read it. There is a whole lot going on with the Main character and it makes you want to keep reading to see what will happen next.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|I loved Passion Pits first two albums, and this is their best yet!<br /><br />It's got a hint of RnB influence to many of the songs, but keeps the distinct sound that made them so great in the first place.<br /><br />Definitely buy this album.
B004BSFC46|3.0|Quality is good.  Great to have for babies who can't hold onto things yet.  However, the straps are a bit short, and may not fit bigger babies.  Mine is only 11 lbs right now and he has almost outgrown these.  Also, my baby never really showed much interest in these.  But that may just be my baby.

B001ANSSDC|3.0|3.5 Stars.  Not your warm fuzzy romance with the happily-ever-after ending, but I knew that going into the story. Overall I enjoyed the book, but disliked that Quick made Pat sound like a five-year-old. Not only was it not believable, even under the circumstances surrounding the story, but I found it slightly offensive, given he was an intelligent adult prior to his breakdown. I was also disappointed that there weren't more details revealed about the events leading to Pat 's breakdown. This was the heart of the story, yet the reader receives a condensed version in a rushed ending, and suffers through pages of football stats instead. Tiffany's story was also a key piece, but the reader is only given small glimpses dotted here and there between \\"games.\\" Lots of unanswered questions, but the premise of the story is unique and still worth the time to read.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has NEVER written a bad book - only great novels.  &#34;The Racketeer&#34; is no exception.  As I was reading, I could see a Hollywood screenplay being written.  I foresee Denzel Washington, Holly Barry and Jamie Fox as the stars.  PLEASE, Hollywood - make a movie out of this one.  I promise it will be a box office smash!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The inner turmoil Katniss felt over Peeta made this all the more interesting. I enjoyed the depth of the characters. The author did a great job of keeping me guessing what was next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was... amazing. It really made me feel the moment and had a very nice story to it. There was a very good moral to it and quotes and just a great book. I recommend this book for people who like to read mysteries or realistic fiction. It probably would work for anyone. Some friends  of mine read and I know they don't read the same genre a me. So if you are looking fir a \\"I nee  to get back to my book\\" type of book or,\\"I need to read the next chapter\\" read this.

I just wanted to kick her a few times (not too hard though). WAKE THE HELL UP, ABBY!<br />Travis is to die for. I immediately loved him. Sexy, intelligent, tattooed and an ass kicker....lethal combination.The only reason this book got 4 stars and not 5 is because I felt the romantic scenes could have been written better...by that I mean more detail....<br />(Note to Jamie McGuire: Paint the picture for your pervy fans too!)<br />I loved this book and you will too...Promise!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The bag was included free as a promotion with my new DSLR. I bought a different sling bag at the same time, which is what I use primarily. I unpacked the AmazonBasics Backpack and it seems well constructed with plenty of room for all your gear, but I haven't actually used it yet.<br /><br />I am planning on using it this summer when I go to Hawaii for vacation. I'm going to take a couple different lenses that won't all fit in the sling, so this will be a great test for the AmazonBasics Backpack. I'm sure it will hold up great.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Amazing! We all knew how it was going to end, but the movie brought us in like it was just happening. You couldn't help to holler as he raced. Very realistic and heartwarming. The best part was the commentary at the end when they told about the people who lived and worked with Secretariat and also the Necropsy they performed on him after he died. Remarkable horse!
B007THA4FI|4.0|It took me a while to get to The Casual Vacancy by J.K. Rowling. I was so worried. I had seen so many reviews that didn't particularly shine a very good light. But then I decided to just dive in. I like literary fiction, and I was dying to see if Rowling could prove herself. I had always said, seven books is cool, but she would really prove herself as a writer when she wrote something outside of the Harry Potter world. (At least to me.) So here was the proof. And man did she do well.<br /><br />So many intriguing twists and turns that made me smile and get giddy. I really liked it the further I read, even though it was a really long book. It probably could have done with some more editing cuts. But Rowling really knows how to write teenagers. The teens in this book were very deep, diverse, and strong. It may have been an adult book, but she should keep teens in all of her work.<br /><br />The use of parentheses was a little overboard. There were some times I would be reading and suddenly I would see a closing parenthesis and think, what is that doing there? I'd look back and see that she had inserted an entire page and a half parenthetical. There is also the issue of switching narrators from paragraph to paragraph. I actually found it very smooth since most of the transitions went from one person thinking about another to the other person then narrating, or something of that sort to show a change in narrator. I rarely had to go back to understand who was talking.<br /><br />I think this book caught such a hard wrap because Rowling's normal audience couldn't wait to devour more of her work. And this is exactly why publishers say not to switch genres as an author. For literary fiction fans, this book is definitely a hard hitter. For young adult fans, it is a complete dud. So take it as you will.<br /><br />My biggest advice on this one: pretend it's not by J.K. Rowling. Don't think Harry Potter will come out and save Pagford from Voldemort in the end. This is not Harry Potter. This is something so different and yet completely stunning in its own right.y Potter. This is something so different and yet completely stunning in its own right.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|Very good movie of early Whitney and Kevin. They sizzle and yet it's sweet at the same time. I can see why it got so many awards :)
B000AJIF4E|3.0|I used to have a pair of old school MDVR600 and they were just a work horse of a set.  I picked these up and right off the back the highs were so high.  Everything sounded clear except I couldn't get over the highs.  I am mixing down mainly modern hiphop hop and electronic and to me personally they just aren't made for this type of mixing.<br />I thought maybe it was just my mix but listened to several recent hiphop( Kanye) and alternative (Imagine Dragons) and they were just to hissy for me.<br />I guess if you had time to break them in, cool but I don't and just need them to be flat response right out the box.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I'm no techie slouch and certainly no Apple rookie, but I just could not get this thing to work. First, yes the battery pack is very difficult to install. I damn-near broke the retainer clip trying to get it snapped into place. Once installed, my 2011 13\\" MacBook Pro (Mountain Lion) couldn't find it. I did the usual troubleshooting: restarting, fully charging the device, unplugged and plugged back in; all in various combinations. I read that there is a form factor problem with newer Magic Mouses and the Mobee battery pack so that in order to get it to work, you had to mostly install it. In other words, it wouldn't work if the battery pack was completely in place--no go. I got to the point where I was afraid to mess with it anymore for fear of breaking the battery pack and rendering the product unreturnable. I really hate giving up on these sorts of things; I'm the kind of person who will spend way more time than is acceptable to figure out a problem when just moving on is the better route, but not in this case. I would recommend waiting until a better product enters the market.

Very funny, the image of the Indian family in a quiet Swiss village is hilarious and the characters are true to their origins, right from the Father to the French lady restranteur & the Swiss villagers.  I am glad he made it but the end was not as fun as the beginning and middle of the story.

B00846REIS|4.0|As most part people, I loved the fifty shades series.  It's not only a sexy read but the story is good too.  I was both intrigued and leery to read this one because I didn't want another fifty shades.  I wad surprised.  There are definite similarities, but the story seems a bit more raw.  Loved it! Can't wait to read the second book!

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Watch the former two movies and you have the plot storyline. The whole movie is like a repeat with of a  tall tale told around a camp fire the only thing . that saves this are the special effects. The main stars seemed to apologize for some of the dialog

B00A0SKFLG|4.0|\\"Total Recall (2012)\\" is a remake of the very entertaining [[ASIN:B000HIVOIM Total Recall [Blu-ray]]] (with Arnold Schwarzenegger). Both of these movies were adaptations of the story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\" ([[ASIN:0806512091 We Can Remember It for You Wholesale (The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick, Vol. 2)]]). While I prefer the \\"original\\", this is a very watchable movie. Both Colin Farrel and Kate Beckinsale have good screen presence, and that adds a lot to the enjoyably.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me: The plot centers around Douglas Quaid, a factory worker that has an average life (but a surprisingly attractive wife), that dreams of adding some excitement to his mundane life. This is the future and the ability to implant \\"memories\\" has lead to adventure vacationing without the hassles of actually leaving town, so Quaid decided to visit \\"Rekall\\" for a little excitement. The action picks up right from there and it really doesn't stop all the way through. This does feel a bit like watching a video game, but it is very exciting. The special effects range from decent to excellent.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable movie that includes many of the best elements from the first version and adds some unique twists to keep it interesting.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

B008458O3S|5.0|This is a great puzzle game.  Period.  There is enough variation that you are constantly trying to solve the puzzle and get to the next level.  The variation builds on itself so it gets very hard by the time you reach the last set of cities.
B003R0MF5I|4.0|If you're not aware of the series CHUCK, it's a<br />great mixture of comedy and action.<br />Give it a shot.
B004DM0UII|4.0|This is a good, but not great application.  Using the search feature, you are able to find what you are looking for, like ESPN radio and get a very good signal.  In fact, a much better signal than standard radio.  The drawbacks are its interface, which wasn't necessarily intuitive.  For example, I could not find how to stop the signal and exit out of the app without trial and error.  I would say I am looking forward to having this program on a trip so I can really put it through some paces.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was well written and well documented.  The author was successful not only in presenting the facts without bias, but also in examining all known possible explanations for his experiences before reaching his conclusions. Well done!

B008QI6EHQ|5.0|I think I waited 45 years to read Hitler's words because of my aversion to this tragic episode in world history.  I wish I had read it sooner.  In fact I wish everyone would read it today.  Hitler's first work is filled with inconsistencies from my perspective.  It is also hard to comprehend his hatred of Jews and Marxists in the context of current times.  I'm still at a loss to explain the differences between Marxism and National Socialism in the mind of Hitler.  It almost begs the reader to think that the thing that distinguishes National Socialism is the belief that under Hitler, they would execute it better than the Soviet Union did.  We have heard that argument in favor of Communism and Socialism for a century.<br /><br />Here are the key points to be gleaned from the work and reflected on.  Hitler believed that the state was nothing but an organizational framework for promoting and protecting nationalism.  We once believed that but no longer do. Today we are told that the state is omnipotent and may not be questioned. Anyone expressing criticism of our government is labeled an extremist.  (Jefferson is rolling over in his grave) His most cogent points related to propoganda and the masses and it is here that we see the strongest parallels between Nazi Germany and our country today.  Hitler knew that the intelligencia wouldn't subscribe to his propoganda but the uninformed would eat it up. They did and the rest is history...repeating itself in 21st century US.
B008D47DXC|4.0|I enjoy comedy.  Kids can really be entertaining.  You never know what can happen when your cancels your date and then take a babysitting job!
B002JVWQT6|1.0|Of all the lame shows on TV today this one is the lamest, by a long-shot. It's boring, extremely cliched, and utterly pathetic. The comedy is tired and low-key and is never irreverent or groundbreaking.<br /><br />This show gives a tri-perspective of three families. One is gay, the second is interracial, and the last is straight and white. Consequently, they're all pathetic and cliched, especially the gay one, it seems like they're just there for the sake of being politically correct. How is this funny? Furthermore, in retrospect it actually seems like they're all just clustered together to make the show look more progressive and diverse than other shows but realistically what normal family in this era do you know that has all the aforementioned groups living in an upper-middle class community?<br /><br />Of course like almost every comedy in the last 10 years the male lead characters are portrayed as the most ignorant and gullible, except the gay ones of course. The females are slutty and unoriginal.<br /><br />What happened to the good old days when gay shows were statistically normal and only aired on gay stations or had one modest gay comedy on mainstream TV?<br /><br />And did I mention cliched, hell even the DVD cover rips off Party of Five.
B000JIN3HK|3.0|The 1940 \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (hereinafter P&P) starring Laurence Olivier is really awful. They are wearing clothing from decades later (hoop skirts like in \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and made ridiculous changes to the story (Lady Catherine is in cahoots with Darcy and thinks Elizabeth is good for him). They made Mr. Collins a librarian instead of a clergyman. Even Olivier said that Greer Garson was wrong for the role of Elizabeth. Characters are missing (the Gardiners, Maria Lucas, Georgiana Darcy!) and there is a slapstick element in some parts that seems wildly inappropriate (Mr. Collins running after Elizabeth), Lady Catherine sitting on a music box, the Bennets letting Lady Catherine in and making her step over broken china that is on the floor). Major plot elements are either removed or altered to such an extent that it is not worth watching.<br /><br />The 1980 v. the 1995 versions:<br />I disagree with the reviewer who called the 1980 version more authentic than the 1995 version. In the 1980 version Lizzy laments that Mr. Darcy would not send her a letter but in those days a man could not send a letter to an unmarried female. That is why he had to personally hand her the letter he gave her after his first proposal. Also the clothes are not as authentic as the ones in the 1995 version. They changed certain lines for no apparent reason. They have Mrs. Bennet showing Lady Catherine in--that would not have happened. They had servants to do that. Mr. Darcy is so stiff in the 1980 version that you can almost feel that he was directed to be proud and ram rod straight. He is too wooden. Colin Firth's Darcy's woodenness has a humanity behind it. You don't think about the acting while watching him. The 1995 version is much more fast-paced and engaging--just like the novel. I did like the actor who played Mr. Collins in the 1980 version better than the one in the 1995 version. He is more like what is described in the book. Mr. Bennet is pretty good in the 1980 version but overall the 1995 one is vastly superior. It draws you in and you feel like the characters from the book have come alive.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Phillip's first album, but after several listens I'm liking it more and more.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Very well written. Great characters. Clever story and emotionally complex. A very satisfying book. I hope she writes many more.
B00004WPAE|5.0|The vinyl pressing is superb. And the song lineup features re-mixes of a lot of classics. The album is a must for Beatlemaniacs.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I usually purchase a children's Blue-ray DVD every year at Christmastime for my<br />daughter.  I'm adding to her collection for when she has my first grandchild.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|If you like movies with revenge plots you will love this. Ultraviolent, so watch it without the kids. I loved it.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I bought this for 2 kids, aged 3 and 7.  It's kind of hard for those to ages to play a game together, but they both loved it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book... it was written very neatly. Some of the story didn't run as smoothly as it should have though. But it was definitely a good book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|&#34;The Martian&#34; was well written, but the ending was cut short, and left this reader wanting more. I would still buy another book by Andy Weir !!!
B008PE9GSA|3.0|The kings of Texas boogie pair up nicely with producer Rick Rubin.  The cover of the '90s Texas hustler anthem &#34;25 Lighters&#34; (here, called &#34;I Gotsta Get Paid&#34;) is by far the highlight but several other tracks find ZZ in good, reinvigorated form.
B000NY12CI|5.0|I found Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali a real eye opener and inspiring read.  Beautiful and brave.<br />This book moved me to tears of pain and joy and not just on a personal level,  Her thought processes and reasoning gave me a better understanding of some political situations than I ever gleaned from news commentary.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B005NS0VNU|5.0|Here is the only compilation that has the three songs in it that I want. You hardcore REM fans don't need 'Stand', but I do.<br /><br />As I expected, some of this music is mixed 'everything louder than everything else', but the sound is not butchered like a lot of 'the loudness wars' stuff. I am fussy about sound quality, and this meets or exceeds minimum requirements.<br /><br />The part I am most pleasantly surprised about is the tri-fold cardboard cover. There is not one bit of plastic in the packaging of this compilation. Kudos for making it real!
B000JML90Y|5.0|What can I say I had to read the original. Charles Darwin's observations are as insightful today as they were when written.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Nice game, fun, but not always sure what I am supposed to do. Couldn't find a restart when I got stuck (like at a closed gate), so I just kept pressing the back button until I got back to the menu. Also, top many animations slow the game down.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I watched this series two times, and I would probably watch a third time. The cast is really amazing and I enjoy their screen companionship in the evenings. They are nasty characters in many ways, none of the characters are angels, there's no real protagonist I have to say. But you do root for their fates. Bad but real people and it's liberating in a way to be in their companionship.
B004X8W42M|5.0|This book is fantastic. It's hard to put down. I love non-fiction and have read many books about musicians. This life story is by far the best autobiography I've ever read. Hands down.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I watched the entire series, all 3 seasons, two to three times within a month. Just couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />My criticism for this season is the Spartacus actor isn't as good as from the previous season. He's too baby faced and doesn't look like he wants to kill anyone. He also lacks the tension that the other actor had with Illythia.<br /><br />Except for this it was another amazing season overall.
B00992CF6W|3.0|My 9 Year Old Son and my 6 Year Old Nephew play this game non stop and cannot seem to get enough of it
B006ATJXQW|5.0|This is the best way of telling how Thomas is put in the maze and how his mom gave wicked her son
B0061S073A|3.0|Works great and even prevents her from following adds in free apps! Just responds a little slowly when she tries to exit before it dumps her back in kid game land...which means she keeps pushing buttons while the app is trying to reopen its self so she ends up restarting the wait for herself over and over.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|I am a huge fan of &#34;Family Guy&#34; and &#34;American Dad&#34;.  this movie was about 45 minutes too long and both of those shows are much more funny. parts had us laughing out loud, but it was a stretch to make it a full-length movie that was entertaining for only half.
B004WR125O|5.0|I just hooked this WLAN transmitter to  my brand new TX-NR5009 and works like a charm. All I had to do is enter my WEP code to connect to the net and presto. Although I have not connected to my network yet but it should not be a problem.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a blast . so fun get this game so cool a jet pack come on that is cool.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Easy read and keeps you interested. Its better to get the story from someone that had boots on ground instead of the media. I was interested, because Bin Laden and his grand vision (I say that with so much sarcasm) took many lives and took the fathers, mothers, daughters, sons and whatever type of relative away from their families forever and for the 6months-a year that people had to stay over there at any given time. Thank you for authoring this...<br /><br />US Army and US Air Force Vet.....
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Not quite up to his usual standard but enjoyable nevertheless and can still be recommended to Michael Connelly readers today
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Such a fun game for the family. With the different levels and grid sizes my 5 and 7 year olds<br />love it as much as me. Gotta love games that promote critical thinking and problem solving while having fun.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Can there be any more Star Wars??? At least it's a game I understand and can play with my grandchildren so they think Grambie and Dede are pretty cool.
0345803507|5.0|I have to agree with the others, the trilogy could have been written better. there were grammatical errors and way too many HOLY COW, HOLY S__T, HOLY F__K, etc.<br />BUT despite all of these, I couldn't for the life of me put the damn books down! I have read the trilogy multiple times and I have to honestly say that I have lost count. The sex and BDSM side of it is amazingly fun and erotic to read. At the same time, if you read between the lines, the trilogy is in fact to me a beautiful love story. If you concentrate on Christian Grey's character and attempt to dismiss the BDSM side of it, he gets an A+++ in romance! Just read how he treats and kisses and makes love to Anastasia. The little things that he does for and to her are so lovingly heartfelt and warm. The epilogue of the third book was to me an added bonus. It gave the reader a glimpse of how their lives were after Teddy came along. I couldn't believe what they were still doing even after Anastasia became pregnant! It was so sexy and erotic!!<br /><br />I had such fun reading MEET FIFTY SHADES which was the very last part of the third book. It involved Christian's perspective from the moment Ana fell into his office. He talks about what he felt from that moment on all the way when he left Clayton's.<br /><br />I had to go back and forth between certain chapters to witness and pinpoint exactly when they started falling for each other.<br /><br />after having read the trilogy multiple times, I have to say Christian and Anastasia fell in love from the very moment they met on May 9th, 2011. They just didn't know it. This was the day of the interview in the first book.<br /><br />I do not have a favorite out of the three books. I loved reading each and every one of them and will probably read it again in the future. I am just waiting for the movie to come out now.<br /><br />For all fifty shades fans, keep your fingers crossed for an awesome movie release!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|If they love it that's fine with me and makes the grandparents happy as well as everyone else. Easy to play.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like that the app allows me to wake up to my own music instead of the regular alarm.  it also lets u set multiple alarms unlike most free alarm apps.
B0039OGGVQ|4.0|This is one of Slash's best efforts. I like his guitar playing and he is really good. My favorite song on the album is \\"back To Cali\\" with Myles Kennedy. I also liked \\"Doctor Alibi\\" with Lemmy Kilmeister. Get this album and Apocalyptic Love.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a great book, very easy reading and keeps the reader interested.  Not normally a King fan, but glad i read this book!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I read this book in 1 day which is unusual for me. It's an easy read and I really enjoyed it. But I'm not sure how someone whose not a fan would like it since it goes overboard on the Eagles chants and rituals. While somewhat accurate it got tiresome and I love the Eagles.  Also partway through the book I was wondering if it was going anywhere else as it was getting repetitious. Then it changed course and was a feel good read. I would recommend reading just don't think us Eagles fans are all this crazy.
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is the 2nd book in the series and the 2nd one I've read.  This one was pretty slow in comparison and thought it was just ok.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This was a unique and interesting story even though most of the narrative is delivered in a fifteen year old's head.  It was the ending that gave me the most problems.  Sad I can handle, depressing is something else all together.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Good writing about a real life situation.  One feels deeply for all the characters.  A must read anytime.  I will definitely read more of Jodi Picoult's books.
1607066017|5.0|so i loved Y:the last man...and to be honest it took me awhile to actually get around to reading Saga...so in the start of the year i read a some blog,they had made a list of the best comics of 2012..i agreed on most of them and then their choice for #1 was Saga..after that i was super interested and really wanted to read it..i love vaughan's stuff, so i dont really know why it took me so long to read Saga! as soon as i read the first issue i HAD to read the rest...just read #9 and loving it..there is violence,sex,its uh..graphic and really not for kids lol..i love the story,plus marko is a hottie! lol im super interested to see where they story goes,why each race hates each other,what makes alana and marko so damn special that everyone wants them...anyways,i just enjoy reading Saga..i do not own this vol 1...i have them on digital comic but am thinking of getting this vol or each individual comic..(i normally buy digital as a \\"trail\\" if i like the story then i get physical copies)<br />but this is most def a must read!!
B005LAII3U|5.0|I loved the original and was excited and nervous to watch the remake.  I was thoroughly impressed with the way the remake was written and filmed!
B003Z0BWRM|3.0|It was recommendet to my by a friend and based on her description I read it. It is interesting to read and I do want to know whatchappens next but is is extremely predictable. It is well written for a younger audience but not suitable for adults. There is not much deapth to the story and much of the dialogue is outright ridiculous.
B008MEM24S|1.0|Please fix! Error when trying to buy!  Also where's my Perry needs more levels! Other than that I love it!
B003Z0BWR2|2.0|Took me 2 days of casual reading to get through this. Was tempted at times to skip pages as boring in many aspects. The development of the characters is non existant. The storyline is even more predicting than in the first book. Another review stated that it gets better with every book, that is the main reason why i still read it, still waiting for it to get better though. For someone like me who is really into fantasy books and have read mainly Pratchett, Robert Jordan, Hobb, Terry Goodkind, Harry Potter and Pullman, I thought this might be good. Utterly disappointing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this for my friends son for Christmas and he loves it! Such a cute movie and very colorful. My friend says her son watches it all the time now!
B00A8KJN14|4.0|Sleeve on package was ripped down the side. Movie was cute. Arrived to late to get my double reward points for Disney reward club.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My son hasn't watched this yet but decided to get it for him for Christmas since we go on long trips and drives.  Seems like it will be cute and Amazon had an amazing price on it during the holidays.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a great case. The quality is there and it could take a beating, but do NOT buy the white case. It gets dirty VERY easily. I've had it for less than a month and it already has irremovable dirt embedded in the white backing. Mr. Clean Magic Erasers can even clean it. Other than the white not staying pearly white, it is still a solid case.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|Not a huge fan of the movie but its cute for kids. Got it for christmas for my son because Amazon was having a great price on it. It will do the job while in the car on long commutes for him every day!
B0000TB014|5.0|It doesn't matter what they say about him, he is still one of the greatest entertainers or all time.  He paid a huge price for his fame, and it goes to show you money is NOT the answer to all our problems.  Wish he could have met a Eckhart Tolle or Deepak in his teens?  Would've done him a world of good and we might still have him around to make beautiful music:-(
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son is obsessed with Cars. Bought this one b/c his other one got used so much it broke. This is the widescreen version tho which I didnt realize at first. I was just buy b/c the price was cheaper than the others I saw on here. But it works and not a big deal that its widescreen. He doesnt care!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|excellente application, elle vaut son tarif, tout est accessible à distance depuis sa tablette soit en wifi local soit via Internet grâce à Gmail.<br />vous pouvez même regarder un film son inclus (ça le coupé sur le pc) et la définition est adaptée selon la tablette. top!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|There are two names that are equally synonomous with this piece: Isaac Bashevis Singer (the author of the short story and co-author of the play) and Barbra Streisand. In history, no other person has taken on so many jobs for the creation of one film as Streisand did for this one. &#34;Yentyl&#34; was ten years in the making. though Streisand obtained the rights for the project ion 1969, hoping for it to be the film she made after &#34;Funny Girl&#34;  When reading the short story one would think, &#34;:This could never be made into a movie&#34; However, Streisand covered all of these issues by using voice overs to express inner monologue; somewhere along the way she decided to contract Micheal Legrand and Alan and Marilyn Bergman to turn these monologues into songs and since Streissand, who wrote, produced, directed and edited this film, also played the title rolel, was suddenly singing the most remarkable film music ever written in history. (I include &#34;:The Wizard of Oz&#34;, &#34;Singing in The Rain&#34;, &#34;Jaws&#34; and &#34;Fame&#34;- I do not speak of Boradway trnsfers to film such as &#34;West Side Story&#34; or &#34;Sweeney Todd&#34;) So through the systematic solving of some big problems we now have one of the finest film scores and film songs in history.<br /><br />The story is remarkable and every element of the film is accurate. Not only do we see the Jewish life in Poland fifteen years before before the first world war but we see the struggle between the role of men and women. It is her desire to learn and to read and be more than a cook and housewife that causes the young girl to disguise herself as a Yeshiva Boy<br />(student) cut her hair and travel to the big city to enroll in school.Yentyl takes on the name Anshul there and parts of life that she never imagined opened up to her. This film contains none of the usual folly that ensues as a result of cross dressing tactics; it is not a comedy and though the same things may well happen here that one sees in La Cage Aux Folles and The Bird Cage, they are depicted with the hard pain of the reality. Even this is brought to light through the artistry of Streisands work.<br /><br />The film begins by following a white down feather along a flowwing creek aqnd post rain running puddle, through a market place and into the scene. The detail is precise and this same precision remains until the very last cut which is a camera at sea level looking upon an ocean liner bound for America after Streisand has sung the most amazingly difficult and moving piece of music in the film. The composition of this piece (It is called &#34;A Piece of Sky&#34;) is such that the composers used  fragments of many other songs in the score and fused them together over which they lay this fresh new song. Streisand holds the final note for a total of ten measures; it is a B natural, the note that falls directly on Streisands passagio, and therefore, in full chest voice, has the most intensity that any sung note can have. Composer Jule Syne found this piece of<br />Streisand twenty five years earlier and used it for her voice with the first act finale of &#34;Funny Girl&#34; and indeed, Streisands incredible breath control and support is what has made her so famous because frankly, nobody does it better. She uses the exact same muscles and control early in the film, alone by a campfire after her father's death as she steals away to the city in a remarkable song called &#34;Papa, Can You Hear Me?&#34; Every trained singer who hears this sits, slightly tense, aware that she took no safety breath and that it is humanly impossible to sustain sound that softly for that long, yet, even after fifty years of listening to Streisand sing, she continues to do it and continues to be modest about it. She continues to astonish us.<br /><br />Mandy Patinkin, fresh off the stage from &#34;Evita&#34; and just before his return for &#34;Sunday In The Park With George&#34; does a remarkable job with the co-starrole, playing Avigdor, Yentyl's study partner with whom Yentyl falls in love and Avigdor develops a warmth friendship as though this young boy were his own brother. Mandy Patkinkin has prooven himself time after time to be a remarkable actor and in this film he is no different except that Streisand has managed to block the cameras to intensify emotional moments, whether they are building to a fight or thy are creeping around a dining table allowing us to spy on the emotions of each individual. Patinkin is very aware of the camera staging and plays with it beautifully.<br /><br />Many critics have complained that Streisand did not have Patinkin sing, and indeed Mandy Patinkin is one of America's finest tenors, but their complaints over this are in print because of a lack of understanding and perhaps even idiocy as I have already explained that the music in this film is to allow us ONLY into the mind of the individual who is hiding so much about her true self. If you wish to hear Patinkin sing, buy a CD (I recommend &#34;Sunday In The PArk With George&#34;)<br /><br />&#34;Yentyl&#34; is period perfect, from properties, costumes, sets and dialects to the instruments in the orchestra. If the instrument wasn;t used in Eastern Europe in 1892 or wasn;t invented then it is not here. The harmony is all modal, utilizing much from the Jewish services including some beautify string and vocal parts using the Kaddish that underscore her father's fiuneral and another temple scene.<br /><br />This film was fairly wellk snubbed at the oscars, but then Barbra Streisand has been fairly well snubbed by the Oscars herself for her entire career. She won her first Tony Award at age 19, the same age that she won her first Grammy Award. She won The Oscar for best acress for &#34;Funny Girl&#34; and best original song for &#34;Evergreen&#34; but Streisand is to film direction what Barbara Walters is to journalism and Shirley Jackson is to serious fiction. Had this film been directed by Billy Wilder and come out as good it would have swept the Oscars, instead it swept the Golden Globes where Barbra Streisand became the first woman to ever win as Best Director.. Proof of this is in the film &#34;Prince of TIdes&#34; which would come about seven years later where Streisand directed Nick Nolte and the film was nominated in almost every catagory ExCEPT for best direction. At the Oscars, &#34;:Yentyl&#34; was famously snubbed&#34; With &#34;The P{rince of Tides&#34; it became clear that it was Streisand whom the Oscars were subbing.The opening of the Oscars that year had BillyCrystal singing new lyrics to &#34;Don;t Rain On My Parade&#34; and during the bridge (with the one-four time measure after each phrase) Billy sang, &#34;Did this film direct itself?&#34; The conductor's hands remained up, not moving,Billy stood still and the audience roared with laughtter evolving into a standing ovation. &#34;The Prince of Tides&#34; was nomionated for seven Accademy Awards but 1992 &#34;The Silence of The Lambs&#34; swept all catagories making it (with &#34;One flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&#34;) one of two films in history to win virtually every single major catagory.<br /><br />Thus I can say that &#34;:Yentyl's&#34; lack of oscars should not deter you; should not disqualify it as being one of the finest films of the post Vietnam era and certainly one of Streisand's greatest efforts.role, playing Avigdor, Yentyl's study partner with whom Yentyl falls in love and Avigdor develops a warmth friendship as though this young boy were his own brother.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|We had lost our copy that we have had for years! So sad as we watch it every Christmas!! Thankful to have it back
B0059XTU1S|1.0|Confession: I was and remain a HUGE fan of the original \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, but \\"The Hobbit\\" effort is TRULY APPALLING!<br /><br />This movie so constantly suffers from the inability to decide just which age-group it's being pitched at.<br />The humour(?) is kid's stuff, but it's also quite violent and frightening in parts.<br />Despite this apparently incompatible miss-mash, what TRULY astounded me was the \\"silly\\" slapstick approach adopted throughout.<br />The beginning scene, which is allowed to drag on interminably, is truly like a BAD pantomime.<br />The repetitive comical facial muggings and stock theatrical poses from everybody had me expecting to have to shout out \\"He's behind you!\\", ...or even \\"OH yes you are!\\"<br />I kid you not, it's literally Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, ...except in this case there's thirteen of the overly made-up little buggers.<br /><br />After what seemed like an hour of falling over, knocking into each other juggling dishes,(boom-tish),and more eye-rolling and mugging at the camera, Buttons and Widow Twanky...., sorry, Bilbo and the group set off and you FINALLY think the story might be underway.<br /><br />But no, ...then there's another over-extended sequence with three grotesque ogres or some such having a barbecue and discussing how to eat the adventurers. This is an opportunity to do even more Three Stooge type comedy with blows being exchanged, eyes being poked, guts being punched, burps, farts, arse-scratching and other gross-out humour.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|I was surprised at how brilliantly absurd this movie is, not to mention highly entertaining.  It is a comedy and an adventure yarn, with a bit of romance thrown into the mix.  There's even a history lesson, of sorts, and an obnoxious American pilot who wants to become an actor and then the president.  The plot plays out like an old Hollywood war movie.  There are aerial battles, kidnapped girls, and a grudge match.  And yes, pigs do fly.  The artwork is vivid with color, the score is fun; I didn't even mind the choices for the English dub.  (As always, I also had the English subtitles turned on and no, the dialog doesn't entirely match.  It's almost like hearing what someone has said and then reading what they're actually thinking.)  My only quibble is with a lack of explanation as to how or why Porco Rosso became a pig.  I don't suppose it matters much in the scheme of things, I'm just curious.<br /><br />This is a welcomed addition to my collection.<br /><br />There are not stars enough to indicate just how excellent this movie is.
B004DM0UII|4.0|Grabbed this app when it was free as I have never been able to get Winamp to work properly on my device. It's not always as convenient as Pandora or similar apps, but the sheer varietybof streams makes up for it. The alarm feature is a nice touch as well. Don't know if it's worth the price tag, but definitely worth what I paid.
0761169253|4.0|I got this for New Years. Its Fun, concise and to the point. Clear thought provoking ideas that will leave you taking  new steps in life (hopefully!)
1455502758|5.0|I am dealing with cancer so I loved Hitch's thoughts facing his battle.  It was surreal and I had to smile a few times between the tears.
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked the book,but Eva could get annoying at times,and also Gideon seemed more submissive than dominant.  Still,I will read the rest of the series,because it managed to catch and keep my interest.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Excellent plot lots of cliff hangers can not wait to begin the next installment of the series! Great read for all knob levels
0805092919|5.0|My preschool class really enjoyed this book and even made a class book with this theme. (What Do You See?)<br />GREAT Book for beginning readers!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Although for my wife she seems to enjoy it quite a bit and plays it often. She's more than tickled when she beats it!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I loved this book! I always thought it would be boring, but I found myself laughing out loud, crying, smiling...I couldn't put it down. It was so witty and sweet. It has become my favorite book and I will read it again and again.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A little to wordy in the beginning, the first chapter really didn't do much for the story. Having had a out of body experience and going to the light, he confirmed my feeling that there is a supreme being and I didn't imagine my flight to heaven. Thank you Eben, you described your experience perfectly.
B007X70NVO|5.0|Anyone who loves riding will love this movie. I've never even watched MotoGP before and I loved it. Definitely going to try and watch some races in 2013.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Recommend for a book club. The author kept the reader very engaged in the story. If you have ever wondered what a parents past might have been like and what mysteries their life held you will enjoy this read. Kate Morton is a very good author keeps one wanting to read more of her books.
1419705849|5.0|My son absolutley loves reading books in this series, and is one of the main reasons he has enjoyed reading AND being read to!  Hey - not only is this book a fun one to read....I enjoy reading them as well.  :)

B007M45PMU|5.0|one of the greatest bands I've heard so far. add them to my collections of music<br />now i have new songs to sing to the kids
B009JBZH54|5.0|For the price of one Bluray movie I got the whole Batman trilogy.  The sound quality is amazing as well as the HD picture.  The package a few days after it was scheduled to (I was afraid it wouldn't get here by Christmas), but I contacted customer service and they let me know exactly where the package was and I received it the next day.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I choose this rating because this is the second Bible that i have order and it is the best one easy to navigate choose a book and it goes to that book. you don't have to keep entering what you want
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Pudding Monsters has some good similarities to Cut The Rope - such as how it teaches you the game as you play - but seems a bit less challenging overall.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|If you haven't read this book you haven't lived yet it is so amazing I could read it ten more times.
B004OZOTSQ|3.0|Not sure how or if it works. Added to my Kindle Fire thinking it would make it work when traveling, but took it across state and could not access the internet. My misunderstanding of product's purpose.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even after watching the movie, this book kept me wanting more and I was completely enthralled!! Can't wait to read the next one!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Great to have on my Kindle Fire. The numbers are easy to read and the display of the calculation is a plus. It's also less clutter for my desk.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I mean, I've played minecraft on computer, but now I can enjoy it wherever I go! if I could, this version would get a 10 star rate!
0385523912|5.0|This is a book everyone should read - sad, moving, enlightening - if they want to find out about life  in this secretive state.
B0015AARJI|5.0|excelente ESA es la plabra q heno q utilizar envio y presentacion, muchas gracias, Todo Funciona a la perfeccion, agradecidos con el Productos
B005LAIHY0|3.0|The movie was decent but the way it was pitched as not being a prelude to the Alien series and then finding that it was . . . . it was a bit disappointing.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I give this book a 4 1/2 star rating. It was funny like each in this series. It was great and now my favorite out of all 7. I recommend this book to Jeff Kinney fans or people that like comedy books. I hope Jeff Kinney keeps making more Diary Of A Wimpy Kid.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm still reading the first book & I'll admit, it was a slow start for me.  But the action has really picked up.  Also, there are a lot of characters & it did take me a bit to get them all straight.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is very difficult, but very fun unlocking new things and killing all of humanity. This game is worth the $0.99 i paid for it.<br /><br />This game is played by Jakthemoron at YouTube.com
B0000027I6|5.0|IMHO:<br /><br />I got this CD when it came out in 1992. One of the main themes  Waters  wrote about was the U.S.military  involvement in the middle east, 8 years before 9/11 happened. The lyrics on ATD hold up extremely well, and it is now 2013. CDs usually have a hard time staying relevant for a few months, and the lyrics hardly ever  get *better* with time, but ATD has gotten better.<br /><br />The production values were, are and always will be quite stunning. It's easy to see who the brains behind the \\"pink floyd sound\\" were all along. I feel most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference in style between, for example,  The Wall and ATD, if they didn't know any better. The only give away would be that Gilmour could never play guitar nearly as well as Jeff Beck. In all fairness, who could?<br /><br />Jeff Beck's guitar playing on ATD was, is and always will be an absolute delight to listen to. Waters was very wise to ask Beck to play on this album, and Beck was smart to agree to do it.  IMHO Jeff Beck may have  been  the most gifted blues guitarist on the planet in '92. The interesting thing about him is he has improved over the last 20 years.<br /><br />ATD is prophetic, meaningful, beautiful, mind blowing, and just as, if not more, relevant today than it  was 20 years ago. Everyone involved in making this piece of music should be very proud.<br /><br />If anyone reading this has been or knows someone who is or has been in harms way in *any* war, this is a piece of music should be listened to by such a person. Any veteran of any war would appreciate it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book is excellent from beginning to end! The details of every event are sharply described in and out. Hands down one of the best books in the past decade !
B008B8A9V8|2.0|I think I would like the book alot if it wasn't on my KINDLE FIRE.<br /> I don't like my Kindle
B00APUQRPC|1.0|That's 111 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. I couldn't tell you what's worse... the trite script or the ham heavy acting. All right it's the script.  An over the hill baseball scout needs his daughter's help because he is going blind. They reconcile and she dumps her lawyer boyfriend for the ex-ballplayer... who could seen that coming?! Sad to see Clint embarrass himself with crap like this and the performance with the chair at the RNC. Please stop tarnishing your brilliant career!
B005BDZQKU|5.0|I would Recommend this to all my friends and it came in on time and it was a good price
B0036SQZ2K|4.0|I love pleasant surprises. This film came and went quickly with little acclaim. I loved the cast members and was disappointed at the bad buzz. So I was thrilled to love this movie. Grant Heslov and writer Peter Straughan have successfully pulled off a Coen-esque war comedy of the grandest order!<br /><br />The cast is simply brilliant... every role is perfect.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Our daughter wanted this for Christmas.  I ordered it just before Christmas, and it arrived just in time.  She was so happy to have it, and we all watched it together.  The quality of the DVD is very good.
B0073O0AME|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my sister and she is very pleased!  Great<br />deal and shipping! Thanks for the special treat!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless blew my mind away. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful book that pulled me in from the beginning.I have never had a book pull me in for hours only to come out still in the haze of the book. The winding paths and sharp turns break your heart and sometimes require a chapter break. Hopeless shows that the deepest love someone can have for you spans time not in mere moments.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I learned long ago to stay away from these games because I get addicted. So, of course, when this popped up in an add on Kindle, I got it. And play it all of the time.<br /><br />What I like: You have it your way. I play Las Vegas Solitaire. But you can set it for other types (except Spider which is sold separately.<br />I can delete my losing score and start over again!<br />It runs fast and smooth. No glitches. The cards are brilliant and easy to see.<br />It has a timer and a move counter to help you improve your playing.<br /><br />What I don't like: There are ads at the beginning of each game.<br />I wouldn't mind except some you can delete easily and others don't let you delete until it runs through a certain cycle. One star removed for this annoyance.<br /><br />However, if you enjoy Solitaire, this is the best game I've seen for free. Highly recommended!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome. I knew I loved it from the beginning. I wish it was real in life. -written by my 6 year old
B00A8SPNYW|4.0|Overall, this is a really fun game. The mouse is adorable and makes cute squeaky noises. And I love how he goes all ravenous and goes wild when he finds the cheese and digs in for a feast. The game play is smooth and straightforward. No hiccups or glitches on my phone or tablet; playing nice with Android 2.3 and 4.0. Basically, there's a 3D maze, with a mouse at one end, and a block of cheese on the other end. Drag your finger to draw a trail from the cheese, through the maze, to the mouse. Then hit the play button at the bottom of the screen to see the mouse head into action; working through the maze following the line you drew, straight to the cheese. Sound easy? Guess again! Naturally the levels get more complex as you go along, and there's booby traps and obstacles to avoid, en route to the next block of cheese. The only issue I had, was I found it a bit counterintuitive to draw the path from the cheese to the mouse -- I thought it should have been the other way around -- drawing the path from the mouse to the cheese. It's no biggie, but it seems to make more sense to keep the focus on the mouse, since he's the adorable little main character. The 3D rendering is actually quite good -- so many apps don't refine their 3D rendering as nicely as this one. The animation is spot on, and this is certainly programming up to snuff, and of the caliber one should expect from a FAOTD. But as far as apps featuring mice hunting for cheese go, I prefer Spy Mouse over this one. Both are fun, but for me, Spy Mouse just had that little something extra. But From Cheese is still a fun game and a very well done app, and I'll likely keep playing it. It's just fun, and the mouse is really cute. I like helping him get the cheese and do his happy dance before he devours it with his knife and fork; so proper and mannerly a mouse there never has been. Cute!
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is among the best of the old 'Stones. Very &#34;Bluesy&#34;! This is the type of music to listen to on those long drives!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|HD Premium got an update via Amazon for Kindle.<br />However, this version is sorely lacking &quot;Flight in the Night&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; add-on, as well as additional Sandbox.<br />Extremely disappointed in Amazon. No, this is not a Rovio issue. If there is an update for the paid (premium) version for Kindle, then there should be one for the free version as well.<br />Get with the program Amazon! I am not a happy camper, so-to-speak.
1250027624|4.0|I am only a little ways into reading this book. I am enjoying delving into the characters and the era, but I wanted to go ahead and mention that the book does give away some story line from Season 3. Make sure you watch the first couple of episodes of Season 3 before you start reading this book.
B005IQZB14|5.0|There just aren't enough books out there about the adventures of backpacking !  I loved the journey Cheryl Strayed shared with us, even though somewhat amazing a person like that could survive, let alone complete such an arduous task, I loved her descriptions of life on the trail and living with your whole world on your back.  I love to backpack and know what you give up, to live in the wild with very limited resources and a great deal of knowledge to get you through !  When you return from a pack trip, even turning a faucet to get clean water is a luxury !  Strayed's book was well researched and exemplified true backpacking !
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Great Movie! Of course, I do love all Harry Potter movies, so as a big fan, I love all the movies.
B008SOSBJM|3.0|The album is great, and the picture disk is very cool, but when I received the product from this seller the plastic sleeve was broken on 3 sides. I know the sleeves aren't the highest quality, but it was still embarrassing having to give a gift in that condition.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great Movie! Of course, I do love all Harry Potter movies, so as a big fan, I love all the movies.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great free app.  The bingo play is fun (addictive, really!), and I enjoy collecting items to complete collections in each room and increase my daily credit allowance.  I also love that there is a free daily tournament, so you get 5 free games every day on top of the games you buy with your credits.  It just extends the game time a little, which is nice.  My credits always disappear so quickly...sad. ;)<br /><br />The reason I give this app only 4 stars is because there seem to be a lot of glitches that haven't been worked out yet.  The game regularly freezes which is very frustrating, especially when I can hear the numbers being called but can't daub my cards because I'm frozen on the \\"buy\\" screen; sometimes all of the treasure chests I've collected won't open even though I have plenty of keys; and several times I've bought cards and then suddenly found myself bumped out of a room (having lost my cards and all of the credits used to purchase them!).<br /><br />I've also noticed that the conversation in the chat box can be inappropriate at times...BUT there is a setting that allows you to turn chat off if someone is being really obnoxious.  This is important for parents to know if you plan to allow your kids to play this game...I've seen some downright raunchy things posted in the chat box that kids just should not be exposed to.<br /><br />Because it's free, I don't let these things bother me too much.  If I were paying for credits (which you can do for the price of a pretty penny) then these issues would REALLY tick me off.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this app to BINGO lovers.  I have tried several other BINGO apps for kindle fire, and this one is my favorite. =)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was awesome. Even though I had seen the movie before reading the book, and knew what was going to happen, I could barely put it down. Can't wait to start the second book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have loved playing spider solitaire on my PC for several years, and I am so pleased that I can now take it on the road on my kindle fire.  This app works well, and I appreciate all of the settings that are available to customize it the way I like.  Could be a little more customizable (different cards, backgrounds, etc.) to make it more aesthetically pleasing, but as far as game-play goes this little free app is great. =)
B004XVN1T4|4.0|It starts kind of slow but it gets insteresting very fast. A nice long weekend-read, the book is not too long, I recommend it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We loved playing Angry Birds on my mom's iPad, so when I got a kindle fire I was pleased to see that there was a free Angry Birds app for kindle. =)  Love playing it when I have some time to kill, and the kids love it, too.  However, playing on the kindle doesn't even compare to playing Angry Birds on Roku on my 42\\" flat screen. haha<br /><br />Plain and simple...if you don't have angry birds on your device yet, what are you waiting for???
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Am hopelessly addicted to this show.<br />Great cast and great show. watched season 1 and 2 in less than 1 week
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have to admit that in reading about this app I didn't understand what all of the fuss could be about.  But once you pick it up and start playing, you quickly realize how addictive this game is! haha<br /><br />The game has a nice aesthetic - the boards consist of several brightly colored dots on a black background. Crisp and clean.  There are plenty of boards available at each level, so unless you are an addict and play for hours a day (or have to share with your children! haha), you'll have enough boards to keep you busy for weeks or months.<br /><br />My kids and I all love Flow Free to the point of arguing over whose turn it is.  My youngest is 12, but I think the game would be appropriate and fun for kids as young as four or five (on the smaller boards).  I'm up to 11x11 boards and really enjoying the challenge of working my way up to 14x14.<br /><br />I can't even describe how fun Flow Free is...I just recommend that you download this app and try it yourself. =)
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I am a big fan of 30 Rock - like the show, Tina Fey has the ability to come up with the weirdest zingers out of nowhere. Light reading, entertaining.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Now that I'm done I need to start the third one immediately. This book was so good I couldn't stop reading it.
0062202081|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loved this book ... It was a good history lesson on him also... I would recommend for teenagers everywhere..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best action book ever.I can't wait till the movie comes out. But a VERY long book I can tell you that.
B00846REIS|4.0|Unsure if I like the caracters as much as I liked the caracters in 50 shades of grey. It is a good novel and a pretty fast read.
1439127700|4.0|A history book from a unique perspective. Illustrates some of the little known details of president's relationships with each other.
B004SHGBDG|5.0|Love this guitar pick maker, works great and fun to make our own picks. My boyfriend is a musician and loves that he will never run out of pics now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The NY version is even better than the 1st version. Great Colorado and easy to learn how to play, too! I totally recommend!!
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I took on this book just because I heard that it was accurate in technical details. I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be intensive and enjoyable reading.<br /><br />For someone who liked the story in Digital Fortress, but could not stand the Hollywood style technological inaccuracy. This is a great choice.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|A great CD with a great sound.  Lots of emotion pouring out of these songs.  I enjoyed more than Lungs, which I thought was above average as well.
B003GK22HA|5.0|For me this is the absolute definition of an historical adventure. As always with Wilbur Smith this is an marvelously well written story that goes into great detail yet it stays intriguing all the way. The only downside is after reading this you have no choice but to read the whole Egyptian saga.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not to bad of a read. Could have been a bit longer book and given a little more info on what the background story is. Guess I'll have to read the next one.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game, but I have to turn completly off my kindel to turn off the game. The game itself is fun.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Dad loved it!  King Kong is his favorite movie and this did not disappoint!  Great sound...great picture...great buy!  Thanks Amazon for offering such a great movie!
B000R9RGF6|5.0|What can I say?  I adore the music of Ludovico Einaudi.  If you are unfamiliar with his work, I suggest you listen to something on youtube or download an mp3 tune. If you like it and want to have the liner notes, buy the CD.  This particular CD was purchased as a present for someone who doesn't do well with gadgets and &#34;modern&#34; technology, but who likes this type of music.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter is awesome!  Loved that I found this series on here since I buy most of my tv series from Amazon.  The DVD's are great and Dexter is stunning!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Brilliantly shot documentary. Equally brilliant is the narrator, David Attenborough. I have watched the segment &#34;Insects&#34; multiple times and still get a thrill as if it was the first viewing. Great detail of the little hairs on the bugs. Blu-Ray brings this to our attention. The deep sea creatures are interesting and the follow up information as to how the crew shot these scenes allows us to learn and respect their efforts. This video is worth every penny spent!
B003O86MY8|5.0|What can I say...it's David Garrett and he rocks!  Bought this album for Christmas for my mom and she absolutely loved it!  Will be looking out for more David Garrett stuff in the future!
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Written, Directed and Produced with a 14 year old as its target audiance.  Or maybe just adults with 14 year old mentalities.  I feel ripped off watching this.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I was so happy to find this 25th anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera for my mom's Christmas presents.  She saw this production of this Phantom on WTTW Channel 11 Chicago and couldn't get enough of it!  I was overjoyed that I found it on Amazon...you guys rock!  As soon as she opened it, we had to put it on right away!  I'd had never seen Phantom of the Opera before watching this DVD...loved it!
1595825045|5.0|This is more than just an art book, it's a detailed account of the creation of the show by it's creators.  A fascinating inside look at the process of launching an epic animated series, with a look at the evolution of the characters, universe and plot line.  If you love the Avatar series, you NEED to have this book on your shelf.  You will go back to it again and again.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is good I have to do it to check out my battery life and roll out my new book yes I have to check out my blog
0307266303|5.0|I loved this book!  I was a very novice runner when I got this, and it gave me hope for my knees and to really learn more about how to run in a healthy way.  It's been about 6 months and I am still running strong.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's a really good app but the only problem is that it may freeze only to collect coins but your still playing if that doesn't happen your going to be addicted
B0076DELIG|3.0|MC tries to turn Harry into an action hero in this one.  Exploding helicopters and evil billionaire conspirators are a little too Vince Flynn for an old LA detective.  A good story, but lacks the believability factor of the rest of the series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is really calming~seriously! After being on my feet 10 h a day, when I get home and it's time to relax I start playing. Great destresser. Easy 5 stars!
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great free app!  Fun game, works great on my Nexus 7.  Not as childish as I expected, either.  This is definitely one of the better free apps lately.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I really liked this show a lot. It was so cute it even brought years to my eyes at the end.
B001HTSCZI|5.0|My son (age 8) is a big fan of the Clone Wars television series, so we knew this movie would be in the same style.  Prime Instant Video worked very well.  We purchased the movie (my son bought it with his birthday money) and were able to begin watching it within about 60 seconds through our Roku.  I won't get into the debate over canonical/extra-canonical content.  For our family, it's just a great way to enjoy even more Star Wars.
B0041D843M|5.0|This should be required reading for all med students, doctors, nutritionists, health care professionals and parents or anyone interested in healthy living.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put it down,l loved (lived) this book from beginning to end. The characters and their stories captured my heart!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Riordan finishes the series very well. I am so glad that he is writing a new series with Percy. Fantastic
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena McKennitt what more can I say. We have a number of her CD's. She has such a pretty voice.
0060555661|4.0|this book can be recommended to anybody who likes to start into \\"investing\\" (per definition from Graham a well planed activity is an investment, speculation is gambling or if you have no sound plan).<br /><br />I like the examples from 18th century (which are similar to todays developments) but times have changed a little since Graham wrote this book. It is not so easy anymore to buy a company for $0.3 which holds high rated bonds with a value of $1.3 for each $0.3 share. Since hedgefunds have done this in the 90th (you remember \\"pretty women\\"?) and there are not so many companies left where the book value overexeeds the stock value by such a dramatic portion.<br /><br />Some page references are outdated (e.g. references do not exist at the reference page number) and it looks that nobody really read the revised edition. Technical investment ideas can be backtested and it is less of a gamble nowerdays to trade on a technical base but anyhow the basic idea remains valid: BUY LOW AND SELL HIGH (or sell High and buy back low afterwards, but this is something Graham does not like so much).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I became interested in this program from other watchers and the number of accolades the program was receiving.  We received a Roku player for Christmas and was delighted to find both series one and two available.  Being a lover of English history I am now hooked on the program.  I found the episodes about the war to be quite factual and find myself wondering how the actors endured those costumes!  I can't imagine wearing evening gowns and tuxsedos to eat dinner in your own home every evening, let alone working in them.  I wear shorts and sandals every day!  Thank you for providing this excellent programing that takes us to another place and time.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|So it's pretty easy to understand the game from the get go. You draw a line from the cheese to the mouse press play and he gets the cheese. But it isn't that boring you actually have to make sure mouse is going to cross certain paths an example being he has to step on button first to open a door to get to cheese. It's timed to so you have to find the fastest route. Not bad for $1 and best of all no in app purchases as far as I can tell. :-)
B0037AGASG|4.0|I bought this CD as a gift and never heard the recording.  Most of his music is very good and seems appropriate for  a young girl.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I felt like it was going to be so much better but it wasn't. I think a little more should have been added. I guess it wasn't really to my liking but hey everyone is different.
B002T921AC|3.0|I bought this CD as a Christmas gift for a friend's child.  I have never heard the CD, but I think it was okay.  I haven't heard differently.
B001676320|5.0|Seen them live and together in Cleveland, Ohio. Really enjoyed the concert so I purchased the Blu-ray. With a good sound system connected it is even better than in person. But I would go see either again live if I get the chance.
0521673763|5.0|Understanding the human brain and its multitude of complexities is not easy, but this book not only explained everything well, it also included numerous pictures, diagrams and drawings to help one clearly see how the nervous system works. Now it's easier to explain to patients and families that their mental illness is based on how this complex machine can sometimes go awry, and how certain medications and therapies can help readjust the imbalance at its cause. How nice it is to explain that it's not any will power issue or poor character development, which gives hope and promise of better times ahead.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|would recommend, very incitful regarding training and life style of olympic hopefuls, such an interesting story -dominique tells it without hate and in the end overcomes it all
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Bought this edition as I had been waiting for years for it to come out, and I was not dissappointed. Looked better on my 3D TV than I remember when it was re released as 3D in the theaters. (Seemed more grainy, lost some color and light values). I got the box set to share with others that were pleased also, and the extras fed my interest in this tragic/romantic event.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Love the book overall but it was slow in some places but enjoyable to say the least.  I would (and have) recommended to all my friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never write reviews, but this book was amazing. The characters and plot kept me guessing till the very end. I love the way Colleen pieces together every little detail. Would definitely recommend to friends!
B008DKBPTO|5.0|This is a solid product and it's really nice looking. I feel like it protects my kindle really well and have had no issues so far!
1449410243|3.0|A series of what cats are like.  Somone really understand the way cats think.  A pretty good group of stories and cartoons.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great series. The character development is amazing, with equal coverage for all of them (the rich as well as the servants).
1452110581|3.0|Marked by mistake.  Haven't read this yet.  Am in the midst of reading my periodicals.  Love all cat stories good or bad
B009AMAK54|4.0|If you like Clint Eastwood movies then you'll like this one as he's done it again. Great movie add it to your collection
1441856617|4.0|Love this type of book.  Reminds me a log of John Grisham legal stories.  This is definitely a mystery solved
B004XZ99LO|5.0|I've never been to a live performance by Cirque du Soleil --and I can understand how they would be spectacular -- but the sheer beauty of the backdrops on this 3D BluRay make it a stunning experience. A few times I even wondered to myself if I was missing the wonder of the physical feats by appreciating the 3D settings so much.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Don't buy unless you have time to waste very addictive don't know why its not all that.  dont have anything to add
B003PDMMYQ|5.0|As always, Umberto Eco writes very complicated, gripping stories.  You have to pay attention or you get lost, but it's worth keeping going to the end.  I very much enjoyed it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this for 2.99$ during Cyber Monday deal on Amazon. Great animation, cute story. A little over the top with pushing eco-green ideals but hey, it's a pretty good thing eh? Great for kids and adults!
B009G1PHP2|5.0|I studied this book back in school as intuitive introduction to structural system. It introduces very complex structural concepts in a very simple matter that anybody can understand.<br />I highly recommend it to everybody, from professionals in the structural engineering industry to people without structural background that just want to know.
B004A94FE4|5.0|Let me preface by stating that I have only worn them 2 times, after two long runs. I can't speak to the science behind them (as there isn't much yet) but I will relay my opinions thus far. I am appr. 6'2&#34; 200# these fit me very well, just about perfect. They appear to be made of tough material and have great tough stitching at the seams. Post workout they feel great, keep the muscles warm and &#34;snug&#34; and have a good amount of compression. I can't say that I have seen a huge change in &#34;recovery time&#34; but i have only worn them twice and my longest run was only a fairly tough 10 miler. The real test will be post-marathon.
0061438294|4.0|We are apparently saying alot more than we think we are with unconscious small actions, fascinating.  The beauty of these tells is that the person doing them is usually not even aware they are doing so.
0545265355|5.0|Enjoyed reading this trilogy as a family. Didn't even want to turn on the TV but just get to the next chapter.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|What fun to watch this latest installment of the series. If you want some lighthearted entertainment for the entire family, this is for you. As with the other movies, it touches on family values, whether they are blood related or not. Not a throw it in your face lesson but subtle enough for even the youngest viewer can relate. The humor is a wonderful bonus. Well worth watching.
1449410243|4.0|How can you not like &#34;kitty&#34; books?  Maybe if your a dog lover....  This was a Christmas present and received with the humor with which it was given!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story was amzing i couldnt but it down by far the best nicholas sparks book.. Her story was a beautiul page turn that makes you feel for her so strongely.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Humanizing a video game character, didn't think it would work but I loved it.  This really added to the story of Halo for and is a must for any franchise fan.
B0061S073A|5.0|This app is just what I've been looking for!  I sit with my kids when they use my Kindle but sometimes they get button happy and do things before I can stop them.  This app gives them freedom and gives me peace of mind!
1449410243|4.0|Most chapters are funny and would be appreciated by cat lovers but didn't particularly like the bobcats chapters.  I guess I just didn't get it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I personally, do not read romance novels or any book for that matter. After buying a Kindle, I have been reading books left and right. Anyway, staying on topic, there is a reason why this book has so many positive reviews. I am going to keep it simple since most of the stuff has already been covered. Everyone should give this book a try, it is only $3.00, trust me you are spending your money wisely. At first I was getting a bit bored with all the romance and puppy love stuff in the beginning of the book. However, looking back now, it all makes sense how the author set the book up. She introduces the characters to you making them somewhat real. It is amazing how the story twist and turns connecting everything since page one. I have already loan this book out once, I am telling everyone about this book. Take it from a non-reader turned reader, this is a solid book that deserves everyone's attention for a few hours in the day. Thank you for a good read and solid book.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Big movie, all the action and theme, is a wonderful conjuction of elements! The history of this movie will live forever in our minds.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I had never read the books this show is based off of, but it's an epic and a fantasy so I figured I would probably get into it just fine.  It took me a while to come round to it, but I finally gave it a rent and watched through the whole series within a matter of a few days...very good show!<br /><br />As far as battles and action, it wasn't overall quite as epic as I was expecting in that regard, but there was enough action to keep me engaged in the show...especially later on in the season.  More than that but the twists and the dialogue and the quality of acting in the movie also kept me very engaged in it!  At the end of the season, I was just like 'wow' and very excited to see the 2nd season, which I will probably do soon.<br /><br />My only disclaimers for anyone reading this that hasn't seen the show are as follows:  1-If you are squeemish and don't care much for gore, you may want to avoid Game of Thrones, because there is definitely some gore in parts.  2-If nudity and sex bother you, you probably should not watch this show either because there is quite a bit strewn throughout the show...one scene in a later episode felt almost like porn and I couldn't believe it, and I'm not even easily bothered by nudity & such in movies and shows.  It's still a great show, but those are just a couple of things I felt that some folks may want to be aware of before watching this.<br /><br />Aside from that though, if you can get past that stuff or it doesn't at all bother you, I do highly recommend giving this show a watch...great acting and premise, can't wait to see more!
B009MO5G90|5.0|I always love Milla...this is not a exception! The war of zombies by the Corporation will not end here, we will expect more!
B004EPYZOY|4.0|Disclaimer right off the bat:  If nudity, gore, language, and/or matters involving hell and the Devil offends you or you have children...DO NOT WATCH THIS OR LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH THIS!  Drive Angry has that kinda stuff in spades...sex and nudity (full frontal nudity in a couple of parts), language throughout, and definitely violence and gore and a bit of demonic stuff.<br /><br />That being said though, if you can get past that like I can and enjoy the movie for what it is...a full throttle action thrill ride...then my friends, I encourage you to give this movie a watch.  This movie came off to me as a cross between Ghostrider and Constantine (2 movies I personally enjoy) with some Robert Rodgriguez thrown in (i.e. the language, gore, and nudity...it kind of seemed like his style).<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail about the plot or anything, because you can read that well enough for yourself on the product page, but it is an enjoyable and exciting ride...as long as, like I said, you can get around the language, gore, nudity, and demonic stuff.  If you liked Ghostrider and Constantine though and enjoy Robert Rodgriguez/Quentin Tarrentino films, then this movie should be right up your alley.  Give it a watch!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun. It's got a wonderful selection of mini games.Although some are a lot harder than others. It's a good mix. Fun for the whole family.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The 2nd film in this series, The Dark Knight, is still my favorite of the 3...but that being said, I felt The Dark Knight Rises was still amazing and a fantastic ending to this series, (or at least, we're lead to believe this is the last movie in the series, but there skepticism over whether or not by popular demand that more will be made later on down the road...only time will tell).<br /><br />The casting was great, something frequently seen in Christopher Nolan films...I'd be hard pressed to think of a better cast for this film.  Christopher Nolan is great as Batman in my opinion, as is Tom Hardy as Bane...I thought he did exceptional.  Joseph Gordon Levitt is always cool too, and Gary Oldman, also, is a fantastic Jim Gordon...he is without a doubt one of my favorite actors!<br /><br />As far as the plot line and everything, I won't go into too much detail about it, but I thought it was really well done and succeeded in being a great \\"possible\\" ending for this series of movies.  Again, there is speculation out there about whether or not there will be more movies, what with Joseph Gordon Levitt's character hinted at becoming Robin and the whole idea behind a possible move towards a Justice League movie and whatnot.  Who's to say?  Time will tell.<br /><br />The action scenes in the movie were very well done and just super epic!  There is a fun twist at the end of the movie too, when a particular character comes into light, and those who are familiar with the character whether from comics or playing the Arkham games, you'll be like \\"Oh whoa...that person!\\"  I had an idea toward the end about it but wasn't absolutely sure until it happened.<br /><br />In any case, if any of you have not seen this movie, you need to!  This whole franchise of Batman movies is epic!  Go and give them a watch!

B004EPYZV2|5.0|It had been a while since the first 3 Mission Impossible films and many people including myself I'm sure were not expecting it to be brought back, but sure enough it did, and I think I read that they're planning to do more, which is okay by me, because I love the Mission Impossible movies and they have so far all been pretty good.<br /><br />This one is no exception, and as a matter of fact this particular one is one of my top favorites of those movies...probably number 2 next to the original, followed by 2 and then 3...they're all good though!  One of my dad and I's favorite types of movies to go to are action and espionage, and we of course didn't miss this one in the theater!<br /><br />As far as cast, most of the original cast members did not return in Ghost Protocol, other than of course Tom Cruise.  (Ving Rhames does not star in the movie but does make a special guest appearance at one point...I won't say when or for what).  Anyway, say what you will about Tom Cruise as a person but the man is a great actor and has been in many great films, and this is certainly one of them...he does a great job as usual in this.<br /><br />I was very pleased to see that Simon Pegg was added to the roster as the tech guy...perfect role for him, and I absolutely love him as an actor, ever since Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, and he was phenomenal as the new and younger Scottie in the new franchise of Star Trek movies.  Awesome also was the introduction of Jeremy Renner into the Mission Impossible roster...the man is an absolute action/thriller/espionage genius of an actor and he would have been an obvious choice in my book to play the role he did in this film.  I was not all that familiar with Paula Patton before this film, but she shined in this movie as well I thought.<br /><br />The action sequences are engaging and very well coreographed I thought, and a couple of parts keep you leaning on the edge of your seat.  The story was good and seemed believable enough too.<br /><br />To boil it all down, if you love action and espionage at all, this movie is very good.  If you love those kind of movies and haven't even seen any or all of the past Mission Impossible films, then what the heck?  Get on it friends!r />To boil it all down, if you love action and espionage at all, this movie is very good.

B00A8SPNYW|5.0|But dang - that little bigger is cute. And I see what others were saying about level 6 - (spoiler alert) - instead of running over to the other block to open the door, just run over the first block twice.<br /><br />I'm having lots more fun with this game than I've had with Angry Birds or Cut the rope.  Probably because this is more my speed being an old gammy :)<br /><br />Also for those who think the game is backwards - starting with the cheese and going to the mouse, remember, you're leaving a scent trail. You WANT to start on the cheese so the &quot;scent&quot; gets stronger the closer to the cheese you get. Think about it....the smell is always the strongest where you START than where you finish, so you're giving the mouse a &quot;taste&quot; if you will, of where he needs to go.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm liking it a lot more than I thought I would. I'm glad I bothered to read the reviews, otherwise, I would have past up this little gem.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire HD and have no affiliation with the developer. I simply only review books, apps, and merchandise I like unless it is a really bad purchase at which time I'll write a negative review. I just don't believe in dissing an app I don't like simply because I don't like it personally. Someone else may and I won't cause someone to miss out on something that they may have enjoyed.<br /><br />I think I'm past my 20 word minimum now :)
B009POCG2C|4.0|I got this movie as a Christmas present and just had a chance to watch it last night.  It was a good formula baseball/family relationship based movie.  The main characters played by Eastwood and Adams felt believable in their relationship with each other.<br /><br />As for the rest of the movie it reminded me a lot of the movie \\"Talent for the Game,\\" with Edward James Olmos, an older aging scout, trying to find that last player before retiring or moving on.  In the case of \\"Trouble with the Curve,\\" instead of focusing just on the player they find it is more about the way scouting has changed for better or worse and sometimes the old ways of doing things work better.  I would recommend this movie for people who like Baseball movies however if you don't even like baseball it is still an enjoyable watch.
B0070R8WY2|5.0|Van Etten's voice soars, the music is complex, great production, what more can you ask for?  Get this album now!
B007Q0OUKS|4.0|I know that may sound a little weird but my wife bought this for me and my daughter to play with for Christmas.  Since then I have bought her a couple of more Lego sets from the Lego friends collection.  However with this set she absolutly loved playing with the catapult and ballista weapons, firing these at the other lego people.  Overall it is a good product and would recommend for anyone with a little kid who likes to build things and play with their imaginations.
B008E374PO|3.0|I would like to preface this review by saying that I'm a huge fan of the beautiful music Adam Young has created over the years under the Owl City project. His unique ability to paint pictures with words and blend them together with music never ceases to amaze and inspire me. The Midsummer Station, however, felt a little off. It's still good, but far from his best work.<br /> In writings and interviews about this latest album he has said that he never wants to repeat himself, and for this record he was trying to \\"capture magic in a jar\\" using \\"self-imposed parameters.\\" This \\"jar,\\" it turns out, is typical pop music of today. With the help of co-writers (which he very rarely used in the past), he crafted an album full of very typical pop-sounding songs. Maybe they're a little better than most of today's radio hits, with a bit more magic and a lot more tastefulness, however in my opinion they don't quite live up to the uniqueness and creativity of his prior works.<br /> Musically, though less unique, the album is still interesting. There's some really beautiful piano on the track \\"Silhouette\\" and strings in \\"Embers\\" and \\"Metropolis.\\" The synths on \\"Shooting Star\\" are, for a little while at least, quite reminiscent of the Ocean Eyes era, and \\"Speed of Love\\" is a musical party. For the most part, drums remain at a constant thump-thump-thump-thump that is prevalent in nearly all of today's hits. Though this is slightly disappointing in comparison to the very complex drums of the previous albums, the musical change is not what I find upsetting.<br /> In my opinion, his dreamlike and at times nonsensical lyrics are what's really missing from this album. I miss how his music used to have the power to sweep you away with images of hot air balloons, fireflies, air traffic, downy feathers, autumn leaves, and deep blue seas of paper maché. This album just doesn't have this same kind of lyrical beauty. Flickers and traces of it can be heard in \\"Shooting Star,\\" \\"Dementia,\\" \\"Silhouette,\\" and \\"Metropolis,\\" however it never appears half as much and to such a great extent as it did in previous albums. Instead, the lyrics are usually very literal and unoriginal, especially in \\"Gold,\\" \\"Good Time,\\" \\"Embers,\\" and \\"Take It All Away.\\" I understand that he is experimenting and these changes may not be permanent, however it really is sad to see something that was once so different and exciting fade into a sort of normality. The album itself is not bad at all, however when placed next to other Owl City records, it's disappointing.<br /> So overall I would give this album a 3/5. Though this record was not my favorite, I will continue to follow his music and I'm interested to listen and see how the fifth album that he is currently working on will sound and what experimental twists and turns it will take.

1400069289|5.0|As I enter the later stages of a successful life, by my standards...there are no others, I still strive to be better and give more of myself, so I've been meandering through the self-improvement shelves and attempting to \\"pick-up\\" small self improvement tips !! This book is a keeper !! First, the concepts are simple to understand and simple to personally employ, second, there is significantly less professional analysis, what some might call \\"psychobabble\\" that tends to confuse the everyday layman. As to general applications, they fit the same effective mold, simple and applicable, by everyone !! As a \\"C\\" level executive in major international corporations, I can attest to the importance of \\"corporate cultures\\" and their either effective or destructive impact on the performance of an entire organization. The author not only explains the importance, but makes it clear how anyone can apply the same criteria to their own situation, be it work or home.<br /><br />If you're looking for detailed psychological data and mind numbing statistics that will change your life, this isn't it, if you're interested in ideas that have everyday applicability, this may be your book !! I heartily endorse it !!
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|I'll quickly throw out the pros: I liked the characters. I generally liked the good versus evil plot. It could have been a great story, but there were several things I could not get past. Enough so, that I will not be reading the next book. 1) The book is set in the real world. Waaaay in the future, but still our world. There have been 2 more World Wars since the ones in our times. Knowing what we know now about our general hero worship of wounded soldiers and civilians and how we celebrate any scientific advancement that increases a disabled person's ability to enjoy and participate in life, I cannot believe that an advance, scientific, society like the Commonwealth would have such overwhelming prejudice against people with cybernetic components. In 2012 the world cheered for a double amputee who ran sprints in the Olympics. You want me to believe society DE-evolves in the future to the point that people who have been saved from death or dismemberment by cybernetics will be judged second rate citizens who are inhuman? That thousands of years of evolutionary tolerance will be forgotten? That society would spend the resources to rescue a person and \\"fix\\" them, only to toss them aside, regulate them to the societal trash heap? I don't buy it.<br />2) I figured out the plot way in advance. Pretty much from the moment they mentioned the missing heir to the Lunar throne, I know who it was. I guessed the Doctor's secret right away, too. It left little anticipation for the end of the book, so I felt like I was reading just to have my suspicions confirmed. 3) I don't believe that in the future a modern and powerful culture such as the Commonwealth would actually have a blood lineage monarchy as the ruling authority. The Commonwealth basically evolved from China. They stopped doing the dynasty thing a long time ago. I don't believe they would go back to it. I don't believe any modern society would. Democracy, Dictatorships, Republics, sure. Kings and Queens, not so much. So,I don't buy the whole, \\"Evil Queen wants to merry the Commonwealth Emperor to have political power and produce a royal heir\\" thing. There has to have been a better way to translate that element of the classic Cinderella story.
0765325950|5.0|I was one of those people that picked up the first book of the wheel of time clear back when I was fourteen years old. I am now thirty three so I have been reading this series for more than half my life. I have read each book multiple times having reread the series before each book came out. I know that everyone has their favorite book in this series, and I have seen more than a few complaints about some of the last books Robert Jordan wrote before he passed away, but I am of the opinion that while Robert Jordan's books always fell on the side of being massive; I believe that he truly didn't waste words. I know that this is my opinion but I loved each and every book. They are all masterpieces told to us by a master storyteller. All that being said, it was heartbreaking when Robert Jordan passed away. In someways I felt guilty because I used to joke with friends that he would do so before he finished the series, because it felt like eternities between the release of each book. I had thought him a slow writer. This of course was before I started writing my own novels and now fully appreciate the fact that he was a lot faster writer than I ever gave him credit for. So upon his death I felt both guilt because of my crass jokes about him living to finish the series and true sorrow that something as wonderful as the story he was writing possibly never being finished, and even if someone else finished it how could it ever be as good. I don't know of a single other author who has taken someone else's work and written something that the fans loved. I would make the argument that Brandon Sanderson truly was one of the few people who could have ever pulled it off. And what a marvelous job he did. Brandon captured the heart and soul of the series with the last three books he wrote finishing off the series in what I can only say as breathe-taking. Having read the final book The memory of light I am speechless that someone could give it a rating less than a perfect five. Indeed it almost seems disrespectful for them to do so. I can only guess at their motives to do so, but maybe it is the sorrow we all feel that this grand epic is finally over; that something that has been so near and dear to are hearts has come to completion. But what an ending. I wept multiple times and laughed just as often as I read this book. It was everything I could have hoped for and more. It is another gem another masterpiece. It is the crowning jewel to a story that has no equal. For generations to come all of us writers will find ourselves in his shadow, and indeed if I was ever compared to him I would find it to be the ultimate compliant. Thank you Harriet; Thank you Brandon for seeing this story; his legacy to completion. I stand in awe and I know that Jordan is looking down from heaven pleased at what you two have accomplished.<br />Giving this story a 5 out of 5 doesn't do it justice, and for all you haters out there ask yourselves in what universe could you have ever created something so grand.<br />Happy Reading<br />Lloyd D. Frazier<br />P.S. I completely understand why a lot of you are upset about the date set for the ebook release. After all I would have bought the ebook at the same time I bought the physical book. I have a signed and numbered copy and would have preferred to keep it completely pristine but there was no way I was going to wait until the ebook came out before I read it. I also understand that a lot of you have posted a 1 star as a review in protest to this. but I ask you is it really fair to do so after all the joy these books have brought you. Just something to think about.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|My son (age 6) bought a Kindle Fire after saving up his money and it made me nervouse having it just sitting around unprotected.  When I saw this on line I thought it would be perfect and it is!  His Kindle is securely attached...this case allows him to play it in his lap, on the table, in the car....where ever he might want to and at any angle.  I am very impressed with the quality and the price.  Would for sure recommend this product...for any age!

B001NLKZUA|5.0|This series continues to get better and better. Each character is unique and relatable. This book is nothing less than amazing, I'm buying the third book as soon as I finish this review!
B008S80P38|4.0|I enjoyed the album and I was actually surprised with this new album. It also came pretty quick. I am glad I made this order.
B0063IH60K|2.0|i had been playing this game and enjoyed it but now i can't complete it as an X comes up on  the cards i want to distribute. how can i get rid of this and play a full game.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Without the pigs, Angry Birds is just not the same.  I really did not like this.  Try Angry Birds Space, which is my favorite!
B005LAII12|5.0|Though a bit crude, it is a fantasy come to life, but with heart and insight to our fear of growing up.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|My son wanted this app and I did review it but it only showed a small amount of content in the preview. At first it seemed just fine but then the more things you combine the more graphic it would become. When you combine a man and women it shows (in a cartoon version).....well use your imagination. We immediately deleted it but all 4 of my boys were sitting together......not something I wanted them to see. Not worth it at all.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Beautifully constructed and well written.  Not as good as the first one, which gave a background to each component, literally 'building' Batman.  I would have preferred more back story on the rebuilding of the Wayne facilities and new 'toys'.  How did Batman get this point.  Story points were missing.  But, over all, very well done.
1451696191|4.0|I haven't saw the movie yet because I wanted to read the book first. First I real all the reviews and I thought a lot about buying or not. At the end I said ''why not?'' It shipped just in time and I read it in 2-3 days. At first it got a little ''cheesy'' the protagonist Charlie it's a boy who's VERY innocent and ''dumb'' about many things in life. And has a LOT of lack experience. He also has a different way of thinking and if he thinks to much he loses it and doesn't ''participate'' in life. So I was getting a little tired of reading but at half book it was starting to get me. The way he describes the moment, the music, his love for his friends you can almost feel it like you're there! At the end of the book I just layed there in my bed thinking so much about all those moments when I felt ''infite'' which is such a big word to describe a moment. I also thought of the people who make me feel like that. Just like he feels with Sam. So' I would recommend it! It's a good book, like I said It's hard to get at first but after while you'll start to get along with it and at the end you'll feel...INFINITE.<br />Can't wait to see the movie!
B00275EGWY|5.0|Great movie, I recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it. There are some slow parts, but sometimes you need that to make the other parts even better. Jeremy Renner and becoming one of my favorite actors.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|By the time the USN eventually caught a u-boat the British had had Enigma for years. All the yanks did was risk tipping off the Nazis. This is stolen glory, like wearing the medals for a conflict you weren't in.
6304711891|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies, I mean c'mon Sean Connery is in it! &#34;Welcome to the rock&#34; haha
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was resistant and really did not want to read these books....but I did, and I liked them. No, they are not books that will ever compete with the big authors...they are merely a quick, fun, easy, mindless read. And sometimes, that is exactly what I want to read :-)
0061992860|5.0|Every camper should have one of these in their pack. This book is filled with great information, most of which you hope you'll never have to use but you'd be glad to have if you did need it. The size is perfect as well, not much bigger than a pack of playing cards.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has a lot of twists and changes in direction to develop the characters. I really enjoyed the way it suggested where the story was going and then got there slowly through the characters. By the end, you have an excellent portrait of the killer's pysche, even though you knew who the killer was through most of the book. I liked this book so much I bought 2 more and I'm really enjoying them.
B000065U1N|5.0|One of the best war movies of all time! It's right up there with Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, and Full Metal Jacket.
B003719G40|5.0|The seller was prompt and the item was in very good condition! - - - - - - - - -
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Great package deal that fits right on your belt. The multitool is nice and has lots of uses, the little flashlight is always nice to have and the fire starter is always comforting to have with you. This is the perfect little kit for the outdoors man and camper. Gerber always makes a nice quality product and this is no different. Bear Grylls might be a fake but this multitool pack is not.
B000S1LUE6|5.0|The seller was prompt and the item was in very good condition! - - - - - - - - -
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Great DVD pack, comes in a nice tin case just like band of brothers did. If you haven't seen the Pacific you are missing out.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|Sir Arthur Conon Doyle has written ages ago but the stories still feel current.  What a sense of perception!  Very edgy.  Worth a read.
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|The cable works great on Netflix and other apps. I have a felling that a lot of the 1 star reviews are either user error or a TV that isn't compatible. Works with current apple update . Make sure your tv is on AV instead if USB.
0375869026|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!!! It is a wonderful story and I think almost anyone can relate to the many different parts of this story.<br /><br />I loved that the different points of views could make such different impacts. I did not think a couple of them really landed for me.......... but that did not diminish the overall story for me.<br /><br />Wonderful writer, wonderful story. I look forward to her next book !!!
0316069884|5.0|While I'm not a vegan or full blown vegetarian (I love fish too damn much!) I found this book to be unlike other books of its kind. It was very fair, balanced and non-judgmental.  It doesn't try to guilt the reader into not eating meat. Rather it educates the reader on all sides of the matter. Highly recommended.
B001P06GX4|2.0|This game is great! Lots of fun.<br />The only reason I gave it a low rating is that I was sent a used game with a torn up box instead of a new game that I ordered.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game is overwhelmingly suspenseful! The only negative I can think of that is that it's only one map. It's very fun and I think it's worth the $1.29!!! PS- get app
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is beast. its like the best game ever invented. I haven't played the Pc version but since I love this one ill probably like the Pc version
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I think everyone would benefit from watching this DVD.  Gave good, clear information that the general public probably doesn't know much about.  Makes people aware of how industries are raising and processing the food we eat!  Gives you a better understanding of what people are eating ... thus, after you view it, you will realize that you have choices.  You can choose to eat these foods or not!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|You might think that a movie made in the 1980's about a killer doll, a child's toy no less, would be really cheesy and stupid, especially considering how many cheesy horror films came out of that decade... However, Child's Play is surprisingly a memorable, creepy and smart slasher movie.<br /><br />It starts out innocently enough with a mother buying her son a discounted \\"Good Guy\\" doll from a street vendor. It turns out that in the opening of the film, a sadistic serial killer named Charles Lee Ray was gunned down and dying and transferred his soul into the doll by reciting some occult spell. The doll comes to life and begins a reign of terror that is creepy, bloody and destructive.<br /><br />Child's Play (Chucky's 20th Birthday Edition) DVD has some extras that the first DVD release did not have including several featurettes, audio commentary and trailers. A worthy purchase for any horror fan.

B007KAJG3K|3.0|I am on vacation and I have the downloaded Ultraviolet copy for this movie on Flixster. (Since I am on vacation, I am typing this on my iPhone).<br />I cannot watch the Ultraviolet copy of \\"A Game of Shadows\\" on my wi-fi iPad offline.<br />On vacation with no Internet I cannot see my movies on Flixster. So, I can't play them. Very frustrating.<br /><br />The film itself is enjoyable. That's why I wanted to watch it.<br /><br />Edit 1/18/13: I updated the Flixster App (when I was briefly at a place that had wi-fi) and my two movies are now visible in the program. But \\"A Game of Shadows\\" can't be played because it is \\"processing\\", meaning it needs a wi-fi connection. So, I won't be seeing the film on this vacation.<br />- And I sent a message to Flixster support about the problem. There has been no helpful response for several hours.<br />* Poor customer service along with poorly designed software.<br />There should have been an iTunes Digital Copy option with this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My Bible teacher has been pushing us to read the Bible daily. This is just what I need, since I'm always on my Kindle.

B001KO8AQ6|5.0|Love all 3 of her albums so far and this one was my favourite - it is moodier than the first 2 but sonically brilliant - gorgeous production and mixes...Grafton St is mesmerizing.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|The whole series is not up to the hype....really a Mills and Boon with a bit of kinky sex...nothing to write home about but an ok read
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I thought this movie was very well done. Enjoyed watching! The animation was excellent. I've always enjoyed watching this type of movies.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|An ok read....the whole series not up to the hype but if you like a bit of a love story then you may find it ok...
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I love this CD. I think that I have listened to it from start to finish about five times in the last two days alone.
B008AX1HD8|4.0|Wasn't grabbed as much as I have been with the other Hole books but the character was being developed. Slower start but enjoyable none the less!!!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This movie is one that I must watch each year. The acting and storyline are top rate. This gets me into the spirit of Christmas
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Is it the greatest movie of all time? Perhaps not...that horrible song playing over the end credits pretty much negates that possibility. But it is great fun...especially if you know what you are in for....just sit back and enjoy the ride...
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This movie is one that I must watch each year. The acting and storyline are top rate. This gets me into the spirit of Christmas
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read all three books within about 5 weeks (which for me is unheard of).  I stayed up late one night to finish Mockingjay as I knew I was getting to the end and decided the discomfort of sleep deprivation would be worth the prize of getting to the ending.  Was I ever wrong.  I finished the book, and had the oddest feeling.  It wasn't anger, disappointment or sadness.  It was shock at how abruptly major story lines where settled  - \\"did that just happen?\\" was my thought.  \\"Did Collins just cover like five significant events in about 30 pages (maybe even less than that) with very little detail? I can't believe Collins would write two great books and most of a third book, only to do this to us. Was there was an ink or paper shortage causing her to abruptly end the book with little drama or explanation?  Did she have a strict page limit?  A deadline? I can't help but think about how we spent several pages in the first book going over Rue's death, and it is mentioned throughout the second book as if Katniss lost a close member of her family, yet she knew Rue for all of like 12 seconds.  But then Prim dies and it's barely covered...same goes for Finnick.<br /><br />I just can't get over the empty feeling I have over not how it ended, in terms of outcome (I could care less who lived/died/married/etc.).  I have an empty feeling because all these outcomes are presented at the end and very little explanation is given to how you get there...<br /><br />The series overall gets 4 stars (5 for the first two books).  I am very curious to see how the last half of this book is translated on the movie screen.  I happened to like the first movie, despite its differences and hope the last two are just as good.
0738212415|5.0|I'm so excited that I found this book.  I got it for my son as part of his Christmas and he is going through this book with his new sketch pencil set and sketch pad.  He is learning about shadows and how light hits objects.  It's wonderfully written.  Simple enough for a 5th grader to understand but with plenty of room for future growth as well.  Highly recommend.
B003TNW044|5.0|I love This series.  I own almost every season now. I have always watched friends and always will.  Great quality
0071373586|3.0|On a fundamental level, this book gives some good ideas on how a consumer views different brands, and how they may or may not be influenced by traditional advertising. However, since the book was written in 1974 the examples tend to be dated, and sometimes the predictions are contradictory to how an observed company actually succeeded or failed. These missteps tended to taint my view of the importance of the authors words. In the end, it did offer some interesting insights and contributed to my arsenal of marketing ideas.
0399226907|5.0|I remember reading this when i was very little.  I had to buy it and add to my collection of good books!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Don't try to guess the outcome.  You'll be wrong. Fast paced read.  Beautiful story will have you smiling, laughing cursing and crying.

B002ZHKZEC|5.0|David Tennant's final specials as the Doctor are displayed stunningly in Blu-Ray and make his presence on screen even more enjoyable.

B0089AD8IO|5.0|It is great to have the first series of the rebooted Doctor Who and have the Doctor you restarted it all help usher it in with Rose.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great graphics, interesting puzzles and a different kind of story. I really enjoyed playing this game. Let'see more like this one.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great read. It's a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. I started reading it as a secondary book to read while I finished reading another book. This book got my attention immediately and I still haven't finished reading the original book. Just wow.

1567184855|3.0|This was certainly a fascinating read. I am faithful to my Catholic upbringing and my trip to Medjugorje in Bosnia to witness four out of six visionaries who are having daily apparitions since 1981 with The Blessed Mother. They all talk about seeing Purgatory, Hell and Heaven and not once did any of them talk about reincarnation or messages from Our Lady with this topic. To me, if reincarnation happens, then there would be a time that our Lady would talk about it to all visionaries throughout the years.<br /><br />I do believe that Mr. Newton actually interviewed his paitents and they told him these facts he speaks about in his book.  I have read many books on &#34;Life After Death&#34; because I enjoy this kind of read. In the books I have read, none of the people who had experienced their soul leaving their bodies, talked about reincarnation. They all talked about meeting a Being they believed to be Jesus.<br /><br />From what the patience told Mr. Newton about what they experienced while being dead a short time, made it sound like they should have been gone for days with numerous meetings with the counselors and leaders.  It's confusing when so many told the same stories but it's the first book I read on reincarnation only because it was highly recommended to me.<br /><br />I didn't find a spiritual read in Journey of Souls. I actually longed to read about it with the person's experience with God and it wasn't there.<br /><br />I just couldn't let go and believe in reincarnation even after reading the book. It's all about what we believe.<br /><br />I try to keep an open mind to things we know nothing about. We all wonder what it is like to die and where do we go. I guess we will all come to the belief we have in our hearts.

B007DIQC90|5.0|Something new and different. Eclectic, unique and fun - totally beats out all those bands that feel the need to remake old songs into crappy hip hop with fake voices. Great cruising music!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories. It's the best book I have ever read!  I loved it!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Myi grandson likes this--he calls it The Worm game! And for 4 years old, he does a great job of figuring out the puzzels!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I think this product should be available for the newer kindle fire cause that's y I wanted one if gameloft makes this and Miami available I will pay 14 for both please make them available I'm very disappointed that I can not get this game because my device is a new version! ! ! ! I love and miss these games! ! !
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Great fun, when I have the time to fool around with it!  Grandkids get a giggle out of it, too!

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Like the rest, a lot of fun when I get time to play!  Nobody doesn't like Angry Birds no matter the season!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. I cried...... I laughed........ this book is just great I will be buying the next one.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Everybody, but everybody loves this game, don't they?  I haven't met anyone yet that didn't get wrapped up in this game and not want to put it down!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so creatively written!  It keeps you engulfed til the end.  With shocking twists and turns its impossible to put down once you start. I was hooked from page 1! Thank you Colleen for sharing your captivating talent!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|Fun to play when I have time, which lately is in remission!  But a good time if you have time!
140131046X|5.0|EXCELLENT LOVE MITCH ALBOM'S BOOKS.  WHAT AN INSPIRATION.  CAN'T WAIT FOR HIS NEXT BOOK VERY EASY READINGI HAVE PASSED IT ON TO LOTS OF MY FRIENDS
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved the way the author thoughtfully wove so many characters and plotlines into the story.  Lisbeth Salander is such an intriguing heroine, and hard not to root for.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good plot, liked the characters.  Yes, I would (and have) recommend book number one.<br />Look forward to the next episode
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book was extremely well written, and hard to put down.  The language in the book was pretty foul, but could be tolerated because it was so rivetting.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I found the 2nd book draggy and repetitive, not well written.<br />Yes I would recommend it (but with reservations) because it completes the trilogy.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is very addictive. Both my girls love to play it and I find myself sucked in when giving them (3 & 9) a bit of help. I need get it on my nook as they don't want to share with me. lol.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I like the way it looks and works, I need 12 more word so here they are nine ten eleven twelve.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Nobody has this much sex!!!  I know that was not the case in my relationship...even when my hubby and I first started dating, and had young on our side!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|This is a great book, with a wrong title: it applies just as much for startups as for big corporations.<br />The concepts of test and learn, don't be afraid to fail as long as you are willing to learn, and to do it all fast and cheap are greatly explored.<br />For my taste, the descriptions take too long, and a clever reader will be able to skim them. It s not enough of a reason to detract from the 5 stars.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Why are these characters always so stinking rich, and seem to have an extraordinary amount of danger surrounding their day to day lives???
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I love the Alien movie series!  If you have ever watched any of these movies then you know Sigourney Weaver is splendid in these.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I LOVED this book!! It got a little too sappy for me in some parts but overall this book is fantastic. I'm absolutely gonna read Rules of Attraction next.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|this was a great game.Once you play you get addicted and can't stop playing. This is just like Temple run but more harder.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This series is amazing. Can't put it down. Not as good as the first but still great. Definitely recommend this book
B009XWD02G|1.0|DONT DOWNLOAD THIS APP ALL THERE IS IS LOTS OF ADDS AND WHEN YOU TYPE IN THE SONG TO DOWLOAD IT MAKES A FART SOUND &amp; IT WONT LET YOU DOWNLOAD IT :(
B004SBS8LA|5.0|At first I was wondering what this new update was going to be like....This game is the most improved app of all the games I own.  I also have it in HD.  I really recommend this RIO game to everyone.  I have had so much fun with it...and it has a variety of freebies or items that are helpers for only .99cents.  OMG!!!!  I can't wait, everyday until I get to my Kindle Fire's...I'm telling you its addictive, in the best possible way.  Go for it....its a great stress reliever. if that's what you need.  Have a ball!!!<br />Theresa
B0091REZMW|5.0|It keeps you tempted for more. Even though it takes a while . To obtain certain objects, I think it is worth the wait. Definitely a game to download, especially if you have the time to spend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is sooooo fun, I get all excited when I win a prize, looks real &amp; I love that we get free coins!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I read this one just because I wanted to see the outcome, what happens to the characters.  she's a very good author in that she keeps you entertained, waiting for the next detail...and on and on.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|no issues with the dvd<br /><br />great classic movie<br /><br />must have<br /><br />fun fun fun<br />how many more words do you want?
B002NT3B52|3.0|it's not a hard read by any measurement, but left me feeling unfulfilled.  interesting stories and nicely written, but there's no real science to it, and it's just not worth the read.  I read it for a book club.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|I like the movie, however, the Amazon movie included some edits that were not in the movie the first time I viewed it.  The edits in the shortened Amazon version removed some key plot elements and made it hard for those who had not previously seen the movie to follow certain key moments and plot lines.  I have to wonder why the Amazon showing was different from the rented version that I saw.
B004HUE57S|5.0|I can use the computer for hours now without suffering stiffness and pain.  I read where others took awhile to get used to the grip and buttons, but everyone in my family took to it right away.  Wish I had discovered it sooner.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this remake. The special effects were great. Colin Farrell made his character believable as a vulnerable but skilled spy and assassin who could not remember his real identity.
B000001G5L|5.0|I have listened to various versions of this werk for 35 years.  The performance of Ms. Mutter is exquisite.<br /><br />John Hnery Mclean
B007THA4FI|4.0|A much darker novel than the Harry Potter series, but Ms. Rowling keeps the reader involved and intrigued.  A very good read!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I movie this movie. It is a classic. It is great for the whole family and funny! Buy the Moose Mugs to go with this.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I liked it but my wife didn't. I wouldn't pay to see it again. Maybe it was made for another generation
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Though these books will never win a scholar's award, it's an enjoyable read. It's easy to pick up and read off and on again. Yes it's full of sex, etc., but it's a love story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely loved this book :) couldn't put it down. I'm not the kinda person who can just sit down and read a book. But with this book I definitely could! The movie does not give this book any justice at all.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Loved the the shifting between decades and the suspense of not knowing what might be uncovered.  Mostly, I loved the ending!
B009YQJ322|5.0|I rented this at redbox yesterday. I love Karl Urban as an actor.  I was so surprised at how good this movie was. I wish it had done better in the box office. It was fast paced and the camera work they did in it I have NEVER seen before in the movies, some truly stunning shots. I think they did a great job with staying true to the comic book characters. I am DEFINITELY going to buy this! I really hope they make another one in the near future. Happy viewing! You won't be sorry :)
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very very wonderful. I loved this book and definitely couldn't put it down. Exciting, fun, and interesting. Makes you think..
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this cd months ago and it is still in my cd player in my car. I am literally unable to get sick of her music. I can't wait for the next album. Celtic, Classical and Dubstep all rolled into one. She is so talented. I wish I could give her 6 stars!
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I got this cd after purchasing 3 singles on iTunes. I figured if I was going to buy more online then make a copy for the car I might as well own the actual cd instead.<br /><br />I found myself singing along to songs I never heard before in the car and actually liking some songs I never heard before but the thing that started to bug me was the obvious inspiration for some of her songs. I'm assuming its Jake Gyllenhaal, but it could have anyone too to be fair, but Taylor lays it heavy in some songs about NYC and his family, which kind of started to creep me out.<br /><br />I would like more songs not about hot, famous guys she dated for 2 months, which I think would make her more grounded/connected with her fans. I think if she wrote ones like on The Hunger Games and a couple other songs I've heard I wouldn't feel like I'm supporting someone's obsessive behavior. She obsessively has the skills to write great songs, so why not?<br /><br />Other than that Red was a good album, but it could have been better.  Some of the songs on the Target exculsive album could have replaced some of the more mediocre songs and then I wouldn't have to keep looking out for those singles to finally pop up on iTunes.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|My daughter loves this movie & watches it daily!  I got it at a great price and plan to watch it myself.  Good job Amazon!!!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was sceptical at first with the book, not knowing if it would be a cheesy romance, but it wasn't at all. The story behind the romance is what keeps the book moving and keeps you wanting to read more!
0316232955|5.0|I very fan The best Sellers, I hope you had soo The video on demand The this Book, I wait for my another &iacute;tems. Thank you.

B0076DELIG|5.0|The ever evolving Bosch character has never been better.  I feel as if he is a member of my family.
B004ADH1RI|1.0|If you want to be subjected to nearly 2 hours of pre-pubescent boys yelling continuously at each other in squeaky voices, then go ahead, maybe the other content of the movie will entertain.<br />For me, I'm posting this review to offset a bit the unimaginable 4 1/2 star overall rating this movie has, that enticed me to waste 30 minutes of my life in the belief that there had to be a scene somewhere beyond the opening that did not consist of kids yelling at each other.
B008IYR2BA|4.0|Good cliffhanger ending, multiple story line possibilities for next season.  Not thrilled with the Deb story-line, not as intriguing as it is creepy.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|Love the movie and the soundtrack is great as well. I think that this being Whitney's first movie, she did a good job. Good love story,
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I watched the movie first so I ended up finding the book predicable although, it provides much greater detail into Bella's journey of become a vampire.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best books I have ever read. The setting and details are dead on. I didn't know it was a murder mystery until well into the book, and I thought I would be disappointed by this turn of events as I wanted it to remain historical fiction. But the history lesson combined with the mystery made it a page turner. Couldn't put it down.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|This is my first Tom Rob Smith book and was pleasantly surprised. It was well written though there a few slow spots. I did have to look up many of the russian words which was a little distracting.
034580404X|3.0|Ordered these books because I had to know what everyone was talking about. They are a quick easy read and once I got into them I could not put them down! If you are looking for something to read on a rainy day this would be the set of books.
B00ADQPB50|3.0|Season 1 of American Horror Story blew my mind. It was fresh to see a show that brought horror to television in a way that was both unnerving, clever, and appealing. Certain elements didn't work for me, but with the overall performances those flaws were easy to overlook and each piece of the story was worked into the whole with purpose, even if it was only a small purpose.<br /><br />Then came Season 2, better known as American Horror Story: Asylum.<br /><br />I'll admit the first episode had me both excited and nervous. The idea of crazy people who aren't crazy trapped in a torturous religious establishment is great as from a story-standpoint, and with a lot of the cast returning in new roles I wasn't too nervous about the acting. Sure I knew the Nazi thing basically from the get-go, I figured that Jude would wind up a patient, I knew the lesbian reporter was the character to watch, but the alien thing felt like a hat on a hat.<br /><br />This season wound up jamming together torture porn, religion, aliens, Nazis, possession, crazy Santa Claus, and a serial killer all into 13 episodes (12 of which have now aired) and it has felt disjointed and over-the-top, and not in a good way. From the obvious revelations of who Bloody Face was to Arden's unmasking as a Nazi, what was the point? To any of it? All of these things came down on the asylum and many of them have been resolved, but the point seems to be that we shouldn't care about any character because they'll all turn out awful and then die. The genre overload not only made the season feel awkward, but with the premise of one story per season they seem to have gotten through a lot of season possibilities in a very short amount of time.<br /><br />All this said I will cite the performances and storylines of Sara Paulson and Lily Rabe as highlights. The lesbian reporter captured by the serial killer to be his mommy really did it for me and it was so well acted, I bought that she was terrified and damaged the entire time. Her turn-around into a strong woman was perfect. As for Lily Rabe she has been able to switch between poor little innocent Mary Eunice and Demon Nun seamlessly, its been amazing. Her performance has piqued my interest in her as an actress and I will be following her career from this point on.<br /><br />Overall this season was a mixed bag at best, with some things that worked and a lot that didn't. But next season is a new story and I'm excited for that as well. If you liked this then it was for you, but its not for everyone. I see the appeal, it just wasn't me in the target audience this year.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just got this book and couldn't put it down. Wonderfully written and there was so much emotion. Loved it!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A charming tale that leaves you wondering where the real world ends and dreams begin.  Enjoyed it very much.  A fun read.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I received the Logitech G930's from my wife, who bought them through Amazon from Accessory4U on November 26 2012, as a Christmas gift on 12/25. I opened them that day and installed and used. I was amazed. It had great sound. The 7.1 was brilliant and crisp, yet bassy and full. I use them for gaming as well and have had great response, and sounds are very clear. However, just recently, while playing my favorite game and they went berserk. I had loud buzzing, cutting in and out, major echoing of my voice, yet no one could hear me. They no longer turn on or off, if I plug it in, I get no charge indication. I hadn't done anything crazy. I kept it charged.  So now I am looking to see what my wife can do as far as getting a replacement or a refund. I wouldn't mind a replacement, I understand that s*** happens and it could be a  fluke, but hopefully we can get some help somewhere and I can get back to good sound again    [[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]].
B0000039QA|5.0|One of my favorite albums of all time. I still listen to this whenever I feel a need to escape all of today's mainstream pop sound.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had so much bloody fun reading this book.  REAL sci-fi; which means this historian didn't comprehend crap beyond the name Archimedes.  Look, this tale was filled with suspense, adventure, snark, and real humanity.  I loved every sarcastic comment right to the very end.  This is the kind of book that I'll think about for a long long time.  Especially when I eat a potato.<br /><br />In my next life I'm coming back as an engineer.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|Honestly, easily the best mainstream electronica albums to be produced in 2012. Every track can be played without a skip. It's THAT good!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Was too cheap to buy this so waited until it became available at the library. Boy, am I happy I did. For me, its not re-readable. The first quarter of the book was OK and the last 2 chapters were OK. Everything else was just blah.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|What an unusual story,  such an amazing concept - I can see this being made into a movie. This book touches on the imagination in a way that is very believable.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have watched this movie countless times. i can never get tired of it. Her acting and singing is phenominal.
B0054W4JQK|5.0|This story kept me on the edge of my seat, and the twist at the end kept me thinking about this book for the next day!  Very believeable, a psychological thriller with the emphasis on anticipation rather than frightening the reader.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|as i watch this show it is easy to see why it is on MASTERPIECE THEATRE. PBS has always shown wonderful shows and this is one of the best.
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the way the author told the story, you gained a picture of the characters from the letters and the pieces built up like a jugsaw.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I love hiking and have done some hiking on the PCT, so I could relate to a lot of the joys and trials she faced.  The way she was so candid about her life, both good and bad, took a great deal of courage to me.  I have to admire her perseverence in adversity. I liked the book so much that I could read it again and probably will some time in the future.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Look past the raunchy sex bits (gets a bit much at time!) and you will enjoy the story line.<br />Well written insight to the effects of upbringing, and life as a child.
0307592731|4.0|Good story, well told. Cheryl made poor choices and was ill-prepared, but she survived and thrived and that is a good lesson.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Great follow up on previous book. Again I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone, especially to men, great insight as to why people are the way they are!!
0812993292|5.0|I'm a walker. Walked from LA to Washington DC, from Leningrad to Moscow. %,000 miles total. I wish I'd met Harold Fry! This is a beautiful story. I couldn't put it down. Read it through the night.

B008602KQI|5.0|I like that the package came as fast of it could. I choose 3-5 day shipping and it came in 3 days, it took the minimum amount of time.  The CD came in good conduction there are no starches and it works great
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! Full of emotion and drama. I couldn't out it down. Loved it!!!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was so good I couldn't put it down.  There is something for everyone to learn from it....parents, lovers, teenagers, etc.  A worthwhile read.
B00004THAY|5.0|It seems that Eric Clapton and BB King go back a long way -- there's a nice photo in the liner booklet from maybe the '70's of them together, with BB with his hair styled and Eric with a pseudo-Afro!  Let's say thirty years later, on this disc, they sound good, and there's an nice airy feel to the sound generally.  They're well-supported and in good voice too, although I've never considered Eric's voice to be more than serviceable.  The guitar sound is great throughout, although I'm not sure what playing to attribute to whom, given the excellent supporting cast.  All the performances are fine.  Some of the stuff I didn't know that impressed me were \\"Three o'Clock Blues,\\" \\"Help the Poor\\" and \\"Worried Life Blues.\\"  I notice that some reviewers see the album as a bit of a cop-out, and it's true that it doesn't have the rawness of some of BB's earlier stuff (although the voice hasn't totally lost its distinctive edge and there's even an echo of a \\"shout\\" or two), but surely both these guys have earned the right to be entertainers, just as Van Morrison has, and Ray Charles had before him.  Indeed there would be something inauthentic about their pretending to be anything but highly successful professional musicians.  So go ahead and get this if you like the artists -- it's cheap now, and it sounds just fine.

B000JMKSE2|5.0|The Manx Cat,the powerful King of the Land of Hollyork,was fat and smoked big cigars. He drank martinis for lunch. All day he bellowed, blustered and belched from his throne atop a tall, glassy tower in the big city. Beautiful girls waited on him hand and foot, hoping for an opportunity to please him. He had everything, and everyone wanted what he had. He was the king of the entertainment and business jungle. His stubby but magical golden tail was admired by all. It was the source of all that was good. It created the hit records, movies and books. It sent forward ceaseless waves of ideas, products and services that everyone purchased and used. Favored singers, actors, and writers became heroes. Other very talented people were ignored. Their voices, sometimes very sweet, went unnoticed. This fat cat was in charge. Everything of consequence was produced and delivered by the Manx Cat. The entire world hung on his every word, as they watched their Magic Picture Tubes and reacted to every twitch of his tiny, yet magical tail. He was the King of the Economic Jungle.<br /><br />Now, there was another cat in a faraway land.The city people in the Manx Kingdom knew little of this part of the world and cared less.This cat was the King of the Land of Maine -- a Maine Coon Cat. Unlike the Manx, he was long of tail,lean and he lived a clean life. His kingdom was larger, more diverse and filled with great multitudes of little people. But they lived in small hamlets far apart from each other.  And  because the people of Maine lived so far apart, they were unaware of their own goodness and wonder.<br /><br />Now the Maine Coon was good king. He traveled from village to village honestly admiring the handmade artifacts of his citizens. He would tell everyone he met about the many good works of his people. In each town he would arch his back and waggle his long tail in appreciation of their interesting and diligent efforts. The little people did create many good and different works, but their work went unknown. That is until...one day when a little girl presented the Maine Coon Cat with a special gift. It was a magical White Cube she had been given by an eccentric, but intelligent, bald-headed troll whose workshop was in an abandoned stable. The electric box captured pictures of every product, thing, talent, and service available in the Land of the Long Tail. Most magically, the Cube could send these pictures of goodies to every person in the land, every minute of the day -- and if the people wished hard enough, the pictures became real and words, music, and things of every sort were delivered instantly to the little people. Sometimes they paid for their wish -- sometimes they got things for nothing. It was a strange and wonderful machine. The people of Maine were now united. No longer were they outcast and unknown. Unlike the people of Hollyork who sold in bulk to the masses, the citizens of the Land Of Maine sold their works one by one to discriminating and dedicated customers.The Maine Coon Cat was most grateful to the little girl and to her troll friend as his Kingdom was now important just like the Manx Kingdom. He raised his long tail proudly for everyone to see. And the people cheered him.<br /><br />Now the Manx Cat really didn't seem to care about the magical White Cube. His tail still had some magic -- but not quite as powerful as before, because the entire world could now see everything everyone had to offer, not just the things that were issued forth by King Manx. Although he took a pay cut, he still smoked cigars and he remained convinced he was king of everything that was important.  Faraway, the Maine Coon King continued to live his clean and simple life, and he too was happy because his people were happy. They enjoyed the Kingdom of the Long Tail.<br /><br />And everyone in the two kingdoms lived happily ever after.t their work went unknown.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|These are the stories I first fell in love with as a teenager (my hard copies are two big volumes in a slip case).  While I would not read too many of the short stories at once (they are formulaic; downing too many at once is like consuming a whole box of candy) the novels are dandy and, I believe, arranged in order of publication.  I had no problem navigating the TOC, and the next time I get stuck in an airport I'm going to be glad I have this.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|I'm only starting to get into fantasy because I find a lot of it poorly written. However, I'm finding the First Law Trilogy really well written and with great character development. I really enjoy the moral ambiguity of the main characters.<br /><br />I'd very much recommend this for someone who is just starting to read fantasy and likes epic political drama.
0061969664|5.0|I loved every minute of Death of Kings. Finally we have knocked off Alfred. Unfortunately Edward seems equally as lame. All I really want to know is when will the next one be out?
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Perfect conditions, perfectly in time, excellent purchase. Exactely like it was described in the announce, I am therefore fully satisfied.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This is a typical and predictable good guys vs. bad guys movie. However, I enjoyed watching all the &#34;mature&#34; action movie actors one more time.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is not the first time I read this book. It is very deep and in the same time delectable. This is also the third language I read it in (I read it in Romanian, in French, and now in English) and it still has he same charm.<br />The book is so complex, I am laking the skills to describe it. Al I can say is that is a great read and a great life lesson in the same time. And while you are at it, try to read between the lines too... you will be surprised :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would just like to say that this is the most funnest game in the world. I need to get $6.99 so I can get this game. I always play on my friends xbox or ipad for this game. I really do love your game:)

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Its been a while since I settled down with one of Mr. King's novels. I had forgotten how much better his writing is than other popular authors. After starting the story, I was so completely immersed that I read marathon style for two days of my Christmas vacation. What a terrific experience!
B00124BNF4|4.0|then this is a great bargain and has a lot of good songs that were hits back in the day. The quality is good.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An amazing story of his life and all that he had to overcome. The book does not just tell the good but both the highs and lows. You really understand who Adam Brown was. An inspiration and a hero.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this to my friends because it was funny and joyful. I love this book! It's now one of my favorites!
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|This movie contains several references to the previous Batman release that I didn't think were necessary.  I welcomed the addition of Anne Hathaway to the cast.  She did a fine job as did the rest of the actors.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|The online features alone make it worth it. However the graphics are kinda pathetic. Low end ps2 style graphics but a fun story mode takes awhile as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story had a great plot.  Lots of unexpected twists and surprises.  The romance between the main characters was tasteful and well written for the age they were.  Really good read.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Very long King opus on time travel and the Kennedy assassination.  Great concept and the story has its moments. Loved the ending.
0316228532|4.0|I read all HP books, and bought this book more out of curiosity than anything else. Even if it is no literature classic, it is quite enjoyable!<br /><br />Rowling is an excellent writer. She can make the story flow, add drama, humor and excitement. Her style is very good.<br /><br />I agree with a previous review that in the beginning a lot of characters appear, and keeping track of them is difficult. But other than that I had quite a good time with this book.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Since before the mechanization of farming starting 150 years ago, machines in one form or another have been displacing humans in the workplace. These trends take time to play out but their impact can be vast: For example farming went from employing 70-80% of the US population in 1870, to just 2-3% in 2008 (Wikipedia). Although government assistance for retraining didn't exist in 1900, retraining was exactly what was happening during this period, and on a massive scale. With the benefit of hindsight we understand the positive effects of eliminating manual labor and enabling whole new industries to absorb those displaced workers and expand living standards for all. While the revolution is happening, though, it's a different story: We mostly see job loss and chaos.<br /><br />With this backdrop, the authors' basic thesis in this book is: We are about to enter another major wave of technological unemployment, driven by the confluence of (a) rapidly improving IT and robotics technology, and (b) the existence of large sectors of the economy, mostly repetitive jobs, that are on the cusp of being \\"automatable\\". In the next 5-15 years, the authors argue, we will see large numbers of people lose their jobs in the manufacturing, distribution, and retail sectors. The authors further hypothesize that we can already see this happening: The tepid job growth coming out of the current (~2012) recession is symptomatic of a secular decline in jobs due to automation, jobs that will never come back.<br /><br />Personally I think the thesis presented here is spot-on. As someone who works in the tech industry in silicon valley, it's dead obvious to me that in 15 years Walmart (if it exists at all) will not employ thousands of people restocking shelves. What's new is that the authors are among the first economists to be tech-savvy enough to see what is happening. As the authors point out, it is the exponential nature of change that makes it easy to underestimate the future impact of technology, which tends to render tasks long considered impossible to automate, suddenly possible.  (They cite Google's self-driving cars, Siri's voice recognition, and IBM's Jeopardy-playing computer Watson as examples of things considered infeasible just 5-10 years ago, but now practical.) Most economists don't have technical training that allows them to see what's possible in five years, and so they cannot perceive these trends or their impact.<br /><br />That said, I would have liked to see a little bit more in the book.  One area is additional specifics on the impact of technology on particular jobs, and where are the largest pools of labor that are likely to be affected near-term. I would also have liked to see more quantitative case studies, for example studying an automated warehouse and how human staffing is reduced as current technology is deployed. Putting more numbers to their analysis would help frame the magnitudes of these changes. Finally I would have appreciated some thoughts from the authors on what is an appropriate response, for workers and policy-makers both.<br /><br />Quibbles aside, this book is both insightful and important, and for that reason I highly recommend it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book was amazing! I enjoyed every bit of it. The book has great detail to it. It is one of my favorite books this year so far. In the end the story finally clicks and its amazing to see what the author came up with. Defiantly one of the best books I've ever read.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Saw the movie and can relate watching this dvd with it. Great, both movie and DVD.  Nick Jonas and all the rest of the cast did a great job.
B004QX07G4|5.0|If you are a fan of Ellen, this is an easy to read, must have book!  She is completely herself and you feel as if she is talking to you personally.  Had me laughing aloud from the very beginning and is very difficult to put down! Great, enjoyable book!
B00004ZKVM|5.0|This album changed my outlook on life and pleasure as a teenager.  Morrison and the Doors music -- mesmerizing, like some epiphany!
0321714113|4.0|I bought this book because it comes highly recomended in the C++ community for beginners.  I have not worked my way through the entire book, however the excercises leave something to be desired.  Mostly they are identify the correct syntax or is this statement legal.  I don't think this goes very far to teaching a student how to code. If you don't write it you won't remember it.  The only other issue I have incountered has been mentioned by another reviewer; The examples often references variables that have not be mentioned sometimes for a page or more.  You will find yourself flipping around and scanning text to locate what the authors where referencing.  It can become rather tedious.  Overall great content poor teaching tool.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My kids loved this movie!  They felt it was possibly even better than the previous Ice Age movies, which they loved as well.  It was a perfect movie for family movie night!  Entertaining for all ages.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This is a really enjoyable CD. If you like instrumental rock then this would be a fun one to purchase, it has a lot of different themes and is pretty musically diverse.  Mr. Satriani uses a lot of really interesting guitar effects to add a little bit of intrigue to his music.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This was one of my all-time favorite television series, so I jumped on the DVD set when it was first released.  Then I decided it was one of the few DVDs in my collection worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray.  Although the BR packaging is quite good, it's not quite on par with the wooden box packaging of the DVD set.  Still, the BR set is a welcome addition, and I was able to sell the DVD set to help offset the extra expense.<br /><br />I see the price has jumped back up from the $43 I paid to currently $65.  It seems like the price of DVDs on Amazon is more volatile than the stock market!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Always nervous buying used, but no problem with this order.  Movie in great shape and I got it really fast too!
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Given that this is one of my all-time favorite movies, it's one of the few dvds in my collection worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I read the book, which is excellent, when it was first published and thought there was no way a movie could do justice to what happened there.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Technically, both the video and audio quality are excellent.  In terms of value, the extra features, most especially the commentary by some of the military personnel who were present, are alone worth the price of admission.  As far as the movie itself, this is a great one.  The story is compelling, especially since it's based on an actual event.  The directing is top-notch.  The acting is excellent and wholly believable.  Black Hawk Down is the sort of movie that stays with you long after it's over.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is a worthy tribute to our men and women in uniform in general and to the soldiers who took part in this battle in particular.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|Somewhat choppy retelling of the entire Alatriste bio. Definately a role Viggo was born to play, his characterization is what makes the movie.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great series and a wonderful homage to our Greatest Generation.  This is one of the few DVDs in my collection worthy of the expense to upgrade to Blu-Ray.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is awesome...non-stop action, edge of your seat scenes...it's great. It's definitely faster moving than the second season, and you can tell they listened to what viewers were missing from last season. Can't wait to see the second half in February!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This set was one of the few in my dvd collection worthy of an upgrade to Blu-Ray.  I'm speaking of The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2, of course.  Part 3 is a complete snoozer and if I could have saved a nickel by buying only 1 and 2 I certainly would have done so.<br /><br />Since I was in no hurry, I waited for the set to be on sale, then bought it for $20, almost half of it's current price.  It seems the price of dvds on Amazon is more volatile than the stock market!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|easy to  setup great app, is great to use and will protect you if you set it up all the way
0307593312|3.0|Previous reviewers have remarked on the boredom of the last third of the book; they are not wrong.  But it's still worth praising the first two-thirds----an enveloping, weird, well-shaped act of imagination (at least for first-time Murakami readers, as I am).  Reading it is like walking through the anterooms of a palace: each door opens to bigger and more beautiful rooms than the last, and you find yourself getting sucked in.<br /><br />I can't wait until you get into the greenhouse with Aomame and The Dowager----lucky you!<br /><br />Butterflies and flowers aside, none of the characters you are falling for are really admirable or sympathetic people, but the author has a powerful alchemy that makes them attractive on the page.  He also makes them do implausible things without damaging the story (in particular, Aomame's professional modus operandi makes little sense inside 1Q84 or out of it).  This may be why one blurb says, \\"Murakami is a magician\\".<br /><br />Like all illusionists, Murakami's show only lasts so long, and by the time you finish the book the show taking place in your mind will be over.  1Q84, as other reviewers have remarked, is not a world you'll want to keep going back to----and that may be just as well, as all of the characters are trying very hard to get out of it themselves.<br /><br />You should feel perfectly justified in getting out early.  Books, when they become page-turners and keep us up at night, develop obligations towards us that they can't always fulfill.  Luckily we are well-capable of breaking the contract in turn----it's much easier than walking out of a movie theater.<br /><br />If you only skim part III for \\"the good parts\\", and to find out what happens at the end, you'll be missing very little.  In the first two parts, Murakami has set up his main characters, Tengo and Aomame, in an attractive field.  In the third part he only watches them spiral together (very slowly), adding a mediating particle (Ushikawa) for good measure.<br/><br />During this slow infalling, we learn nothing fundamentally new about the main characters or the issues that the story runs on.  Those pages, therefore, didn't really need to be written; and so, they don't really have to be read.<br /><br />If you read the book this way, feel free to give it four stars; but save the five stars for the book it could have been.  You might think that the \story of 1Q84 simply ran out of steam after part II; actually, it seems to have been Murakami who got fatigued (marathon-runner that he is).<br /><br />For there are several fine mysteries remaining at the end of part II.  Who are the Little People?  Where do they come from?  What goes on inside Sakigake?  A shift of perspective would have allowed us to see that part of the story, while the Tengo-Aomame story finishes of its own accord.<br /><br />For some reason Murakami chose not to raise the curtain on that act.  I don't think this choice benefits the reader: he hasn't really given us enough building blocks to imagine those mysteries for ourselves.<br /><br />If he ever writes a sequel that approaches those topics, I hope he also takes the time to trim the fat from part III.  Until then, trim it yourself.<br /><br />GUIDE:<br /><br />The book is worth reading for you if you enjoy the first chapter.  After that, you'll probably want to read up to the end of part II.  If part III gets slow, you may want to skim it to the end.<br /><br />There are some wonderful inclusions that you may enjoy in themselves (The Town of Cats, the Gilyaks, a quotation from a Japanese epic poem).<br /><br />It reads at a moderately fast pace, but as it is a long book it will be a substantial time commitment even if you curtail the third part.<br /><br />The hardcover is beautifully designed and worth having.
B005V5WBFG|2.0|its not totally free you think they would state that on the download but they do not its not simple to setup
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it every time. You won't know where the novel is going until near the end--very suspenseful! I loved it.!
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen is hilarious! With that being said, the book wasnt what I thought it was going to be, instead it was just a smorgisboard of junk. I think she just wanted more money and thats sad to say because I dont see her being that person, but this book made it look like it.<br /><br />It didnt change the way I feel about her and I would probably still buy her books.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Kids love this simple game, keeps their mind busy.  Parent approved. On long trips this easy but involved game keeps the kids quite.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|A great album by the XX. Coexist is Kind of short but i like the beat and feel of every song.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Fun game but sucks when you make progress and the whole app crashes and it doesn't save your data with gameloft live
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. One of the best I've read in a while. It is uniquely written from two different perspectives. Twists and turns abound. If you like psychological, mystery, murder, or twisted humor, read this book now.
B009H442DG|2.0|I loved Grease so I though this might be a fun cd to have.  I forgot that John Travolta is not a singer, he's mainly an actor.  He needs to keep his day job.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed Gone Girl because I feel it was a topic that is intriguing and the author took a different twist (style) in writing than I'm used to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book. I find myself completely lost in the games with Katniss every time I read. If you saw the movie you really need to read the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it.  You cheer for katnis and peeta every step of the way. Definitely worth reading again and again.  Awesome
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Bought it immediately after finishing the second book and haven't put it down yet. Absolutely love this series. Every time I pick it up I get completely immersed in Panem.
0786958731|3.0|So I liked the idea of co-op. Avoiding my nephews and kids hitting constant competition and some kid whining about losing, or another rubbing it in as a bad winner, etc. This game was meant to offer them a simple boardgame delve into a dungeon. It does that, does it well, and comes with TONS of minis, missions, etc. That said, it's designed very well, the characters in this version stand up very well to the mobs/missions, but for some reason unlike some other games we own, the kids don't get immersed in it as well. It just kind of feels linear and you feel lead along. Maybe I need to work better at narrating or something, but that's just my 2 cents.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had to buy as soon as I finished the first book. Riveting, couldn't put it down once I started it. Can't wait till they make the movie now.
B004G25V9S|1.0|First of all, I would like to tell you about my historic musical experience. I have loved rock 'n' roll for all my life. When the late 1990s arrived, I felt that the creativity in rock/metal had started to plateau, that was the era when bands like Korn & Limp Bizkit came along & I was not impressed, heck, I don't think I'm going out on a limb when I type that the only thing good from then onwards in mainstream rock was the Foo Fighters. I started learning to play the guitar in 2000 & I was hooked. I had discovered Opeth in 2004 & I was amazed, I honestly thought that nothing that was both legendary & new would come to be. After listening to Still Life & Blackwater Park I was blown away. I bought all of their previous albums & in the future, I bought all their new releases. When Ghost Reveries came out, I new in my heart & head that that would be their last great album. I was not impressed by Watershed or Heritage. I think the message is very clear, it's better to die than to fade away. It would of been stupendous if Opeth could of left on a high & perform their last world tour after Ghost Reveries so that we could remember them as simply awesome, to say thank you & good-bye. Opeth started plateauing when they produced Watershed & I find the timing of Peter Lindgren & Martin Lopez leaving the band before this as evidence for my opinion, even though with Peter it was due to a lack of enthusiasm to continue playing with the band & for Martin it was for mental health reasons.<br /><br />I understand that Mikael loves music & that he believes he will continue to play, write & perform music until he dies. I respect that, I really do. However, I think it would of been best to preserve the Opeth name in eternity as legendary with not a single bad album produced. Mikael should of thought about his legacy & moved on with a different project or some alternate career in music.<br /><br />What do you think?
B006JPML7K|4.0|Cute, not as good as the first, in my opinion, but my son loves it<br /><br />Family friendly fun and cute
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is great! It helps me see the time, wake up, and the weather, for free!  I'm thinking of getting the paid version, where you can get custom clocks, and wake up to your music.  This even shows ads that I'm actually interested in, and it doesn't keep bugging you to get the paid one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wasn't expecting this book to be what it was. It was absolutely amazing. Very good storyline and well written. .
0786838655|5.0|My daughter recommended I read this series after finishing the hunger games. The book reads a lot like hunger games....leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter....sending you to the next one!
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Great graphics and game play!  Very challenging and fun game for all ages! My kids love it!!!  Really nice animation, can't go wrong with this game....
B007THA4FI|4.0|I like the book, but a little slow in getting to the point.  Ending was so-so.  I love J.K. Rowling but this was not her best work.  Worth the read though
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Green knows how to tell an enjoyably sad story that makes you see the world differently. He makes you think about death (something no one wants to think about) in a way that almost makes you no longer fear it.  I need to read it again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I THINK THE GAME IS OK, BUT SEE U NEED TO BE ABLE TO SWICH MODES AND U NEED IRON AND STEEL CUZ WHATS THE POINT OF JUST HAVING TNT IF U CANT DESTORY WITH IT. IF U WANT JAILBREAK IPHONE GET THIS APP.GET IFILE AND LOOK ON YOUTUBE FOR THE REST. THAT WAY YOU CAN SWITCH MODES.
B009JEMF0Q|4.0|I found this to be another complete album by Ellie that you can easily listen to from beginning to end without having to skip any songs.  Some songs I found a little to slow or meh, but overall another great album from this folk/pop singer.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I Hate Facebook. I have tried to get off of it every way possible. I keep coming back because it's the easiest way to communicate with my friends and relatives. If there were a more invasive nastier product on the planet it would be hard to find.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|Love the music videos and the different stars and the ease of navigating the program. Lots of enjoyment from diverse music genre, artist and singers and being able to play song on demand thru search functionality.
B009IU69JY|5.0|I have watched these movies over 150 times. I will keep watching. They are AMAZING. They are prophetic and Tolkien was a prophet and a Saint. Jackson did an unbelievable job with these, and just at the right time in history too. As the Shadow approaches to devour our world, where is our Aragorn?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love it so much! when. I saw the picture I thought it would be stupid but it is so fun!!!!!! it has almost the same controls as temple run sk it isn't confusing!!!!!! Love, love, love!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&icirc;!!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The thought of a world like this is feasible enough to turn your stomach, but the simplicity of the life and survival of a brave young girl makes you realize just how spoiled and unknowing we are to the availability of the world around us.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great Story, well written. Kept me hooked all the way through. First time to read this author, would recommend it.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This is a great case! I chose this one because it had everything I want. It has the stand option, with the swivel stand option too so you can prop it up vertically like a book and read it without having to hold it. It also has the strap on the back that gives you a grip to hold so it makes it really easy. It also turns on and off with the case opening and closing. All in all, it has everything I need. Its also very sleek looking with the black leather
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Absolutely outstanding series with a FANTASTIC finish.  GREAT television.  The acting and writing is absolutely fantastic, I recommend this to everybody.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting makes the entire series seem real. Wished Amazon prime did not have such a connection problem sometimes during the viewing.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Definitely kept my attention. Really well made and interesting. Makes you realize what a mess the whole banking system is.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Nice alarm with a lot of good features! Perfect for work or school. Would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but nice alarm clock!
B000KG499M|5.0|This was the first time I have ordered the stand.  Decided to purchase just one to see if the product was reliable.  Required minimum work for assembly.  I would order this product again.
B000008LH5|5.0|I've seen 10 years after in the bay area allot of times and they put on one of the best shows ever so this brings back allot of memories.
B009FO96ZC|5.0|I love this! A wonderful follow-up to &#34;To The One&#34;! Great composing AND playing by all involved.<br />Won't get into a highly detailed review, but, let's just say if you like JMcL, I'm quite sure you'll be happy with this work (especially if you liked &#34;To The One&#34;.)
0273710516|2.0|The title of the book was referring to the newest edition, but what I received was an old edition. So unfortunatelly I have not received what I expected. So I am dissatisfied with the service.<br /><br />Old edition title: The Pyramid Principle<br />New edition: The Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing....
B007EDYN36|2.0|I was sad reading this book.  It amazed me that Peter never took responsibility for any of the contracts or of the Lawyers he hired to look out for his best interests, but if your always stoned you just care about your next score.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game. Having trouble with the food.. have bought and grown food and it shows my purchased amount and my grown amount but when I go to feed them, even showing a high number, I just keep getting the box that says I am out of food so buy or grow.... please please fix this so I can play.
B009369Z8A|5.0|TH gets better with every film.  His portrayal of Forrest is amazingly understated, believable and intense.  I'm ready for the next one!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is my new favorite book on my kindle fire and the best book for teens and thank you Rick riordan for this epic book¡
B00908DDZM|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis hit this one out of the park.  Neon cathedral is probably my favorite song from this album.  They also have a bunch of other songs available for download as well.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|Great movie for a great price.  Interesting view of a slightly futuristic government controlled society with Christian Bale about to change the rules.
B000641D2Y|5.0|We usually don't care for the second in a series, but this one was pretty good.  It's a good thing to have around for the holiday movie collection.  You have to have the original, too!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|HOPELESS by Colleen Hoover... Where do I even begin, really? Simply put, this is hands down the best book I have ever read. Literally. In all honesty the way she seems to capture each and every moment of this book simply leaves me speechless. The whole entire book becomes so realistic and I found myself overwhelmed and wrapped up in the book. Every time a character hurt, I hurt, every time they cried or laughed, I felt every emotion as my own. It is a beautifully written masterpiece and deserves so much more recognition than it currently has, to be truthful. Very well done, Colleen. I now look forward to reading any other books you have written.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love The Ref (as my fav Christmas flick), but it's not suited for ALL viewers so this is THE movie for the Christmas collection!
B0083Z614S|5.0|No much I can say about this book as I think it is a great story.....I Love it.....Made me very happy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Five star read. Enjoyed the whole book. Love to see  a movie made from this book. Recommend it to everybody
B008HK3XKO|5.0|One thing that makes the Kindle Fire great is that, when compared to other products, it is very economical. It is great hardware for roughly half of a competitor's equivalent. Is it perfect? No, but for the price you get more than what you pay for.<br /><br />And, I feel safe saying the same thing with this case. It isn't perfect, but for $25 it is pretty great since something similar for a competitor (say, with a fruit on its back) would cost twice that amount... if not more. And, I like how it wakes up the Fire when you lift open the case. I love it, and this doesn't leave me wishing I had picked up something different. For $25, I really don't think you can go wrong with this.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Received within 6 days, in good shape, and as advertised, and good price.  Would order from this company again.  Movie subject helps me better understand this period in history
B007X4ECMI|4.0|This is one of those hit or miss sci fi action films that comes close to really hitting, especially on the humor and one liners.<br /><br />It's basically about an agent (Guy Pearce) wrongfully convicted of a crime who is sent to rescue the American President's daughter (Maggie Grace) when she's captured at an orbital prison facility (she's investigating a drug being used to put convicts into stasis sleep and whether it has long term damage). It's set in something of a near future Sci-Fi piece with cars that drive off the ground and such.<br /><br />The humorous romantic chemistry between Maggie Grace and Guy Pearce was the best consistent thread of the tale but some of supporting cast are below par. There are some nice touches here and there like the convict not letting them pass who has skull tats all around his mouth or how the ally of Grace's character gives her about another minute of air. That said, this is a lighthearted action piece which doesn't take itself seriously so consider it to be casual fun if you enjoy the genre.<br /><br />This French film had a budget of $20M and made a bit over $28M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B; ACTION/CGI: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|My best friend recommended this book. It took me a little while to get to it, but she was so right. It is a funny, fantastic, feminist read. Moran has a quick wit that makes this book a joy to read. Nothing about it that I don't like. I'd strongly recommend it to anyone - in fact, I'm going to have my boyfriend read it next.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|With the exception of Pulp Fiction, Django is QT's absolute best. The score, the expressions, the camera movements, the costumes, the scenery, the campy acting, the very overstated violence, the dialog, the story, the underlying comedy, everything fit together like a perfect puzzle. I had such a good time watching this movie I lost all sense of time. Some people may be offended by the overuse of the 'N' word or the blood splattering.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Gave this as a Christmas present to my husband and he loved it! I really like the fact that it came in a collectible tin. It made it a very nice gift.
1439127700|5.0|I admit to being something of a presidential politics geek, so this gift was just the book for me. I was amazed at some of the alliances - like Nixon and Clinton and Truman and Hoover. The book highlights how, post service, these men were willing to put aside (most) of their emnity and serve the country. To some, this might seem like a given. But men with the ego, ambition and power-hunger to seek and secure the presidency should be enemies of those in the opposing party. Instead, they are usually giving of their time and perspective. If they disagree, they try to hold their tongues in public. A fascinating read for those who enjoy \\"the inside scoop\\" on presidents past and present.
B0041X90CQ|5.0|Great record from a great band, somewhat underappreciated here in the states.  Become a Metal Guru and score this now!
B004JHYRAE|5.0|Book on the subject.<br />Easy reading. Very informative.<br />My wife and I very much enjoyed it reading it. Very entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very good book a lot different from the movie I can  wait to read the other books in this series
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw a trailer for the movie & thought I'd check out the book first - started it & stayed up til 3:50am to finish! It is amazing!! Looking forward to the next one in the trilogy!
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Super easy to use and well laid out. No onerous features, simple, and intuitive. I love it and would recommend it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Absolutely love this series and needed to catch up so I could be current. Hope they don't cancel this show
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|I have a couple of different versions of 2112.  The original American CD release, the Japanese release and a vinyl I transferred to DVD-Audio at 24/96.  This one hands down blows away all of the other versions I have.  Super warm sound and a much better mastering job.  Absolutely love the on-screen artwork as well.  I'd give it 5 thumbs up if I had 5 thumbs!
B0018OASZE|3.0|When Adele unleashes and the instrumental mounts, the power is there and a joy to listen to in this recording. Of my 180g albums, this one certainly has the most extra noise. The deduction in stars is purely for the quality of the press.<br /><br />Each album purchase, even of higher weight albums carries some variation in &#34;clean&#34; sound from the master sources,  the press, and of course general care after purchase. Luck of the draw I'm sure, and I'll certainly enjoy it when I put it on. :-/<br /><br />My two cents, in case others have similar experiences.
146500632X|5.0|My13 yr. old  granddaughter loves her 2013 One Direction calendar also. Anything One Direction is the hottest item for young girls this Christmas.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|A great 3d arena game. Levels and enemies can get a bit repetitive but its still great for an entertaining way to pass the time.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This book is like a good action movie.  Somewhat formulaic but very entertaining.  Good characters.  I like the Sigma Force books and this is up there with the better ones
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Beautiful scenery and a gripping story that makes you think &#34;What would I do if...?&#34;  James Franco delivers a very believable performance.
B009A882D0|1.0|I have owned various LP's and CD's of CCR and this collection by far has the worse sound. No pop, flat dynamics. I have no idea what happened. Was remastered by Phil Horn who does good work. Phil can you tell me why?<br /><br />Avoid this collection. Many others that sound much, much better. Love the selections to bad the sound is just aveage at best, and I am being kind.<br /><br />Just A/B a cut from this collection and compare it to John's long way home CD of his hits.<br /><br />Shame, I love CCR.I purchased about 3 cd set with 50 tracks. Title Creedence Clearwater Revival Collected CD.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love the kindle fire lightweight case.  It fits perfect and has a nice velvet lining. I read in bed alot and the case serves as a stand and balances on my lap. Great case for good price.
B0053EOFHW|5.0|I really like this movie. Normally you purchase a movie, and watch it once a year or so. This is one of those movies that has it all, sci-fi, action, and adventure. Something I can watch over and over. Enjoy!!
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is a very poor imitation of Fifty Shades. Other than graphic sex scenes, this author did not display any imagination.  A troubled Billionaire boyfriend with masochistic tendencies, how original! A total waste of time.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Book was a fast, compelling read.  Covers many teen angst issues beautifully with good discussions questions at the end.  Told in letters form vs chapters.  Interesting
B007EDYN36|5.0|I don't know if everything in this book is true or not cause of conflicting stories with Doc on the Kiss Kruise but than again I don't think Peter's got much to gain or protect compared to Doc.  Peter took a lot of self blame for his mistakes but he can give as good as he can take or better. This was a great read and gave some interesting info that I always suspected about the inner workings of this band.  For anyone that's a Kiss fan you gotta have this. Even for a casual fan it's really attention grabbing.  Just try to keep an open mind and think about the info before judging.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|The  puzzles are challenging, with new ones and hudden object/logic tasks mixed with perennial favorites such as Towers of Hanoi.  A very thoughtful,  well done game with a lot of bang for a coupla bucks.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Not only does my sweetie like this toy, but so do our cats!  Moving that little ball around can keep any of them entertained for an hour or two.  Really glad I picked this one up!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|bought this cooler simply because it was cheap and was looking for an alternative to stock cooling for an i3 3220. i thought it would be really heavy but its not. setup was easy once i read instructions. i get 34c on idle but i dont have a dedicated gpu yet so i guess thats why its running a lil warmer than usual. overall an excellent product.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|rthanks for the quick response . the movie was great ./  we enjoyed it greatly . wqould recamend it ,
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|iT IS JUST &#34;GREAT&#34;...VERY TWISTED......HOWEVER VERY WELL CRAFTED....  YOU WILL FIND NO &#34;REDEMPTION HERE&#34;.....JUST PURE EVIL ENJOYMENT!!!  LOVE IT ALL........
B005NKGEP2|3.0|As a supporter of debut novels, I looked forward to reading Pavone's first publication. I finished it last night with the nagging feeling that the plot was great, but I didn't know who the characters were nor did I form any emotional connection. This bland character approach dampened the tension for what could have been a brilliant novel. For example: I could not envision Kate and Dexter as a couple because page after page there is little love or friendship demonstration, but then Pavone would throw in an emotional comment such as Kate remembering what she loved most about Dexter.  Huh? I knew WHAT they did, but I didn't know WHO they were.  The plot is purposefully built for secrecy and plotting, but the character relations should have been more developed. I give Pavone high marks for the plot development. So if you're a person who doesn't care much about character visualization or connection, this mystery is your book. As for me, it was lukewarm.<br /><br />For those readers who felt that Pavone had an insider help with marketing his book I say, \\"So what?\\"  In the long run, the quality of the book and Pavone's writing skills determine how successful this book will be.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case was much less expensive than the namebrand ones.  I have had it for over a year and it has worked great--very durable.  It actually is better than most because it is lightweight and doesn't take up as much space as other cases.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I decided to acquire this movie after reading about it on line. After receiving it and looking at the first episode it was evident that I was going to enjoy this movie. Within two (2) days i had viewed the entire series because of its intrigue. The story was just fabulous and the action kept me on the edge of my seat. Each disc showed very clear and this contributed to my anxiousness to view the series as quickly as i did.<br />i have already recommended it to a few of my friends and I am sure they will enjoy it as well. I look forward to getting the second season as soon as possible.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|cpu with onboard graphics is pretty nice. i wanted to get an i5 3470 but i don't need it and the money i saved buying this allowed me to buy an ssd. the hd 2500 graphics are ok. i mostly play world of warcraft on my machine and i plan on buying a dedicated gpu later on. this runs wow on fair with  no lag in 25 man raids which is perfect for me right now. definately recomend this product. also this one is 22nm so i can use my memory at 1600 which is good. buy it.
B00005JSGK|5.0|thanks for the quick service . we enjoyed it greatly . we are john wayne fans . would recamend  .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fell in love with this book.  Could not put it down and now wish I had not finished so fast!  This book is filled with unpredictable twists.  It is wonderful!
0545128285|5.0|HE LOVED IT STATED IT WAS JUST AS EXPECTED AND FELT IT WAS WORTH READING FOR ANYONE AND SAID HE LOVED THE BOOK
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|The cameo cast seems more star-studded, but perhaps that is due to the first season being so good. This season's episodes do not have me wanting to see the next one with any sense of urgency that the first season did.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|I like the way this game looks, and the sound. Despite the fact that it's black and white, it's still interesting to look at. I enjoy the game play, it doesn't feel like a lot of the other fish games out there. The controls are good, which is no small feat. The problem is the repetition and difficulty/scoring. It's very stingy with the stars, which is annoying because I'm a perfectionist. even when I feel like I did a great job it might give me 1 star or none. It seems to score based on speed rather than accuracy which seems strange to me. And sometimes I don't know how the heck it's scoring. Basically it's the same few challenges over and over, with increasing difficulty. For example you must get your health to a certain number, hit a certain number of checkpoints (a circle you sit on) or stay alive for a set time. I think I'm on level 15 and already it's too difficult. The death blobs cover the checkpoints or health spots. It really affects my enjoyment.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is sooooooo much fun! I love playing everyday! It's not to hard but not to easy, the graphics are cute, and it is an all around fun game.
B00633W614|5.0|This trilogy is very similar to the Kane and Abel novel, which was one of the best books I have ever read.  He ha finally returned to his former quality writing .
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Well  i can't enough of this series. ALL of the gang is great, but Sheldon is my favorite, in this one the interaction between him and Amy is hysterical. Caution DO NOT eat or drink while watching this episode. All Amy wants from Sheldon is some attention and when she becomes sick she gets it, but she wants more. more is what she got but not quite what she was expecting. Sometimes we don't know what we want till it is offered, then well, we take it and ask for more.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LOVE THIS PLACE AND AM ALWAYS ON WHEN I GET THE CHANCE I REALLY LOVE THE GAMES AND BEING ABLE TO CONNECT WITH MY FRIENDS
B00A8SPNYW|2.0|This is a clone of Yoshi's Fruit Cart on Nintendo Wii U minus all the challenge and most of the charm. If it wasn't free I'd feel really ripped off which is probably how Nintendo feels about this, err, fromage.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Good job!<br /> I really like and live this game! This game is the best I prefer this game to all the ganersnout there j.<br />this world!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Its like Jerico meets Men in back in the best way possible.  When they try to have special moments the acting is a little duchey however, it is a great show.  Cant wait for season 3!!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Love this movie - its just a lot of fun to watch!  And I LOVE being able to watch it in so many formats - makes it easy to travel with it!  LOVE IT
B000W7JWUA|5.0|very high quality. top notch.  got it to me super quickly.  also, the game didn't come with a few of the little wooden pieces that it was supposed to, so i contacted arts game store and they sent me the missing pieces like the next day.  i was very impressed.  5 out of 5.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN  I LOVED IT WAY  TO GO ENJOY READING AND JUST WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED GOOD BOOK
B009UX2YAC|1.0|this game is just a cartoony version of temple run. The people couldn't. come up with a game do they took temple run, changed the name, and made it there own. Try to come up with your OWN idea next time Kiloo!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! The only reason I cant give it 5 stars is a bug that makes it shut down ALOT!! It is soooo aggravating! But being addicted to the game, I reboot it and keep going!
0007294662|5.0|A Real great coffee table book ! Also makes a great gift for a  someone (all ages) who has everything.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Got this as a present for my husband who is a HUGE batman fan.  He loves it!  The quality is incredible and we love having the whole trilogy!
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I love this movie! It also has bonus features of how they made the movie. I also loved the bonus extras featuring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i LOVE EBAY I SHOP HERE DAILY A GREAT VALUE AND I CAN ALWAYS FIND JUST WHat i want Thanks
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved the movie and wanted the soundtrack. I got exactly what I wanted. No complaints about the product at all.
030788743X|5.0|Ernest Cline has written a griping fast paced page turner. This is a must read for any gamers who grew up in the coin-op age.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Really suspensefull but too short. Hard to put down. I could not put this book down.The story begged to be longer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book will become an American Classic, it reminded me of Catcher in the Rye in many ways. This is a good piece of literature and is not based on science fiction, drugs, or sex like many books today are based on. I absolutely loved it.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|Until this movie, when I thought of James Bond I pictured Sean Connery.  I'm 60, and I remember standing in lines that spread around a city block to see [[ASIN:B002BXRCV4 Goldfinger]], and I never thought there could be anybody else who could play Bond.<br /><br />Since then the chain of Bond films became synonymous with stunt-oriented, fantastical tales full of whimsy, exotic locales, and girls, girls, girls.  Bond himself became defined only by the particular villain he chased down, and there was a certain mass-produced feel to each of the post-Goldfinger era.<br /><br />Though still a popular and cash-worthy entity, Bond had become a franchise; the films became increasingly silly, and the only really interesting patter about them became who was going to be the new Bond this year.<br /><br />Then along came Daniel Craig, and 007 came alive once again.<br /><br />The most remarkable and successful aspect of \\"Casino Royale\\" is that, after twenty films in the Eon line its producers decided to use it to reboot of the Bond legend.  Like the new [[ASIN:B002WV5A9G Star Trek (2009)]] (minus the temporal window, of course), this movie is the beginning of the next phase of the secret agent's legend. Another likeable quality is that, for the first time in years, a Bond movie plot can be followed in one viewing.  Certainly there are twists and turns, but this is no serpentine movie defying the viewer to follow it.<br /><br />And, as there is no mention made of the previous films or characters within them--save M (his boss) and Felix Leiter (his American CIA counterpart)--our Bond is free to kick start the mythology anew--in fact, one of the most amusing segments of this film occurs when the spy becomes eager to find an alcoholic drink he likes.  After several false starts he quickly orders a vodka martini, but the bartender has no idea Bond is at that moment under great stress, and when the server asks if he would prefer it shaken or stirred, our spy snaps, \\"Do I look like a man who gives a damn?\\"<br /><br />That this is a remaking of the 007 legend becomes clear at the precise moment the movie starts: shot in black-and-white, the first scenes depicts Bond's attainment of his double-0 status through the removal of a traitorous double-agent.  It is made clear immediately that this Bond is a no-nonsense creation; a thug being polished into a highly trained spy.<br /><br />When the film returns to color we find 007 assigned to Madagascar, where has to chase down a spy who has been accidentally alerted by another agent's foolish mistake, and a thrilling parkour chase once again confirms that this Bond means business.  While their target colorfully and gracefully runs like a gazelle, wending his way through a building by ballet-like leaps and agile maneuvers, Craig's Bond smashes through boards and wire fences like the Hulk.<br /><br />It is this aspect which Daniel Craig portrays so well.  He is a lean, hungry Bond, quick-witted and clever, yes...but he has the persona actors like Steve McQueen conveyed so well: a quality that quite clearly said that he is not to be intimidated or outdone.  He is, indeed, a brute who can wear a fitted suit and pass for a sophisticate, but just as the excellent opening theme song (by Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave) informs anyone opposing him: \\"the coldest blood runs through (his) veins.\\"<br /><br />Bond has always had a contentious quality about him toward any of those who would be seen as \\"above\\" him, but it was almost always playful and non-threatening.  Craig's Bond goes a little further: he is a man whose anti-authoritarian chip-on-the-shoulder smugness runs quite definitely in opposition to those who are attempting to control his actions.  In fact, this will be a quality that will fuel the new trio of movies made at the time of this review.  M (played by Dame Judi Dench, the only remnant from the films preceding this movie) is in fact quite ruffled by his presence, and constantly seeks toupbraid him for insubordination.  Yet, even when he breaks into her apartment and hacks into her computer, she does little other to him than give him a tongue lashing. She has her eye on this agent, to be sure, but it is clear the thought has occurred to her that they might just have created a loose cannon.<br /><br />There is scarcely a \\"down\\" moment in the movie, and some scenes are truly spectacular.  Bond's saving of a new airplane prototype is as physical and rough and tumble as they come, featuring not only his prowess with his fists, but also other athletic feats as rough and tumble as, say, Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones.  There is some price to be paid, however, in the new films: after the airplane escapade Bond is debriefed by M in the Bahamas, and his body is riddled with wounds, scrapes, cuts and bruises...and this is NOTHING compared to what he will go through soon.<br /><br />There are many terrific battles, but the one for which the film is titled is a high stakes card game that involves Bond and LeChiffre, a criminal financier who is trying a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy by backing a winner-take-all poker game.  Our side's plan? To bankroll Bond and have him destroy LeChiffre, at which point his creditors come after him and he's left with only one option: our protection.<br /><br />Of course, the game is exciting, and there are several scenes that let us know how vital these games are.  Suffice it to say that there are several deaths...and one of them is Bond (watch the film!).<br /><br />Yet there is more than one climax in this film, and our Bond is not done--not even when an anguished LeChiffre has broken loose and decides to torture a naked Bond in a manner that, well...  Let's say his voice will never reach the low notes again.<br /><br />But, as one might guess, Bond wins the day, and to continue speaking about the plot would be to tell too much, only that what happens is important enough to supply the next film with its driving force.<br /><br />My main bullet point, therefore, is that \\"Casino Royale\\" is a terrific and intelligent movie.  If you have ever seen a disappointing Bond film, be reassured: he is back in form again.  James Bond is no longer a silly, quipping fop whose main sources of derring do are doing things that warrant words like \\"derring do.\\"<br /><br />And I, for one, am glad.upbraid him for insubordination.

B005LAIGPA|5.0|I was impressed with this.  The kids acted just like you'd expect teenagers to act, and they all were good actors.  I'm a major sci-fi fan, and I would highly recommend this movie.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This is one of those books that you just can't put down. It really has a surprise towards the end of the book. Our book club really loved this one.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love Phillip Phillips... This was my first download purchase and it was Quick easy down load!!! Will use MP3 And purchase from Amazon... As always great service.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Thanks was a donation to the pediatric ward at my hospital for christmas for those children who could not be home for christmas.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L. James really improves as an author in her third book of the trilogy. Yes, they still have sex, a lot. But the book is no longer based on their sex lives, there is an actual story behind it now. Seeing her develop as an author and have an actual story behind the sex is very interest. My favorite of the 50 shades book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you don't like this game its eather your divice or you if you play it wrong then it stinks but you have to play it right for it to rock you year
B0000714BP|5.0|Patrick Swayze outdid himself in this movie.  The characters were all well drawn and well executed.  I would recommend this highly.
0060936223|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when a friend handed me this book and told me I must read it. I had no idea Patti Smith was such a beautiful writer. This book is so touching and beautiful and interesting and smart. Needless to say I had to purchase my own copy after I finished it. This book was written with love. It covers the struggles of artists, relationships, and friendships, set to a backdrop of gritty 60s and 70s New York. As soon as I have time I want to read this book again. I thought I knew of these artists: Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe. Personally, gritty spoken word and sexually explicit photography are not my type of thing. But this book is beyond that and reveals the people beneath the legacy and they are beautiful people. This book took me into a world I would have never gotten to see. I can't express enough how touched I was by this book. Buy it. For real.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|good game lots of fun very very good game did not think to much of it Cu's of the name but turns out to be a good game works very good on my kindle tablet no issues at all first load of game takes a minute then works fine after.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book can't wait to read the last book. Best book ever would recommend to everyone. Can't wait for the movie to come out
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was long in page count but the way the story is told the pages just fly by.  The story seems so unbelievable, yet I found myself actually believing it...the ending has a a great twist with a deep message.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This is not something that you can just put on and it'll work. You'll spend hours just getting it to work to the point, that it almost works. You'll put it on and the senor can't see the floor, or the kienect will have a black screen, or you'll have a &#34;halo affect&#34;. It just will not work like you' d expect it to. My Expectations were a bit too high, i guess. Ruined the day for my three year old.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I hope to hike the PCT someday and was excited to read this book. I was surprised how messed up Cheryl's life was before the hike. I'm glade she had the courage to do the hike and be so open about her experience.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved It!!!!!! Can't wait to read other books by the same author...when can we expect more from her!!! Again, Loved the whole series!!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|As always Mad Men is great to watch.<br />Although not as good as other seasons and some of the stories had a strange ending.<br />But on the whole, enjoyable to watch.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Great movie with lots of hilarious references to the actors' defining roles. Loved it, but not much that a movie that prissy girls would like that's for sure.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written and compelling story about a very controversial topic from a scientific mind that actually experienced a NDE, it's very hard to discount many of the facts presented in this book.
B009E3EY4M|4.0|Celebration Day (2CD +1 Blu-Ray) - Love the music &  video, wish I had gotten the one with the rehearsal also. A Got To See item!!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|CHallenging but fun. GRaffics are exceptionally good. The timed challenges add to the game playing. It's one of the best games I have played of this type.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|I never heard of this movie until i find it here.If you are sci fi fan you must watch this movie. Great cast and plot.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|First saw this at the drive-in with my 11yr old daughter &I her friend. It was way better than I thought it would be. Had to get it on dvd for my daughter for Christmas.
B00846REIS|5.0|I highly recommend...... I read it within days. It's a page turner.Loved the dept of the love story and characters. Gideon and Eva will make you fall in love with them.... it was similar to Fifty shades... love, sex and excitement!!!
1426308469|5.0|Emad was fascinated with his booki book.  It will help him continue his exploration of our past and how animals have evolved.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|This album has some of my favorite songs like Unchained Melody, Send in the Clowns and many more. The duets are great also.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Downloaded this book on my Kindle app two days ago and already finished it! Loved the connection between the characters and the web of relationships that intermingled throughout the whole book. Lots of unanswered questions were answered by the end of the book. Great mix of love and friendship while touching on more serious issues like abuse and suicide. Gave me butterflies! Holder and Sky are a great couple, absolutely meant for each other. My new favorite of Colleen Hoover's!
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Follows the book pretty well. We watched it just before going to see part 2 and the combination was awesome.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game it keeps me bound when I'm bored and it'd very exciting and I would recommend this to anyone who loves going to bingo
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|The best movie ever. Super funny great music and a great cast! I've watched it so many times I know the movie by heart
B005UBNKWO|5.0|When I selected this CPU,  more cores are were important than absolute speed.  This is the low end of the 6 core processors, lower wattage (power consumption and heat generation) and it works well, it is very fast.  I do not over clock the stock heat sink and fan keeps the processor 35C ~ 53C, mostly under 40C when doing light work.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the whole experience. What a treat! Mr Riggs writing style and storytelling skill just pulled me along through a memorable tale with convincing supporting photographs!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The book's description had me hooked and, to be honest, I was let down when I first started reading it. The first chapter moved so slowly and I almost gave up on the book entirely. In the hopes that it was just a slow start that would pick up pace, I forced myself through it and am so glad that I did.<br />Mitchell has written a wonderfully complicated book, the kind that I kept thinking about long after I finished reading it. Each chapter is interrupted, some of them mid-sentence. The following chapter weaves the previous one into its own story, so that there is some context for why that chapter was included (although the full meanings aren't always clear until closer to the end of the book). As the first chapters progress, the stories move into the future. Mitchell then moves backwards after the center story/chapter, picking up each previously interrupted chapter and finishing each individual narrative while subtly weaving each narrative together.<br />It's truly impressive how Mitchell has managed to seamlessly weave six individual tales into one cohesive novel. He has some obvious messages in his writing, although I appreciated the subtle ones much more. While I felt that some sections of the book were a bit of a stretch, I still love the book as a whole. Mitchell's style of writing is certainly not for everyone, but I look forward to reading more of his novels in the future.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I didn't know what to expect since I had not seen a trailer for this movie. It was a nice surprise and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|One of the best new alternative albums I have purchased in the past year. Love their sound, lyrics and style.
B004H83IM8|5.0|For anyone who loves Mike Myers in Austin Powers this box set is wonderful. I dislike how the first and third movies are on a double sided dvd. For movies with extra features I wouldn't mind. But each feature should be on it's own disc. Oh well, it doesn't really hinder my enjoyment of the films themselves just the careful handling of the dvds is more vital.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|AMAZING!! I couldn't put it down!! Left me wanting more!  Can't wait to read book 2.  Makes me love reading....
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app does everything I need it to do. It gives today's weather by the hour, the next 15 days at a glance, and can do it for multiple locations.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is a wonderful Christmas cd! Buble has put his spin on some classic Christmas tunes and debuted some of his own holiday songs. I'm always a little hesitant to buy holiday cds, but my family has had this one on repeat the past two holiday seasons so I'm definitely glad I purchased it.
B003SI6C4O|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat with suspense. The best movie I have seen in quite some time.
B004KA9MQO|2.0|Jennifer Hudson is the only good thing on I Remember Me. I don't know why they put all that old stuff on there.
0061733199|5.0|While I have not fully read it yet, the passages are organized and images accompany certain sections that need further demonstrations beyond just words.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|It loaded and installed quickly.  This app is useful in finding Wi-Fi weak or dead spots for both 2.4G and 5G signals.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Different from his other books.  Took me awhile to really get into it.  Ending too flat.  Still was a ok read
B003VANOFY|1.0|Brand new, out of the box and the &#34;receiver&#34; is bad.  Logitech worked with it but no good, so after alot of complaining, they agreed to send me a new receiver in the mail.  To package up and ship this headset back was a major inconvenience for me.<br />I have not received the part yet.....hopefully it will arrive soon or I will have to contact Amazon on this issue.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I've watched better- A bit dumb-Hollywood has to do better, if they expect  anyone to pay then high cost of watching
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I LOVED EVERY SONG!!! BUY IT!!! IT&#34;S WONDERFUL!!! Adele is on fire. I think every age bracket will love it. &#34;21&#34; is a must have.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|beautiful and interesting. this narrator is much better than weaver by the way so make sure u get this version
0385742886|3.0|it was pretty predictable, and very repetitive. it didnt really tell you why or what was happening, until you get far into it
B002ZBZNPO|4.0|I liked it, but I don't think it has the same &#34;soul&#34; that the first album did.<br />It was worth the $5 I paid for it.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This was an unexpected awesome surprise of a movie.  I'm telling ever manly man I know to rent it.  No regrets renting this movie.  I'm considering buting it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm late to the party on this story...i haven't seen the movie, which had already come out on dvd before i thought i'd check this out. I figured i'd borrow the book for free on amazon prime and if i still hadn't finished it at the end of the month i could decide then if i wanted to pay to read the rest. Ha! I read the whole book in one day...i couldn't put it down! Originally i was hesitant thinking it would be too brutal to read about kids having to kill each other, but i was pleasantly surprised to find that the main characters weren't brutal at all and extremely likeable. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy and watch the movie now!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I heard the movie was coming out, and as books are normally better than movies, I decided to read it first.  After reading through it 1. I will not watch the movie 2. I regret wasting my time reading the book in the first place.<br /><br />The book is not very well written, and gives the feeling that it was just randomly thrown together.  My largest issue is that early in the book it says \\"it's a story that will make you believe in God\\".  This sets the bar high, and after spending a decent amount of time writing about the different religions and how Pi learns about them, the second half of the book makes few references to god again and just continues to blather randomly on.<br /><br />The book was highly disappointing.  Save your time, don't read the book.
076790592X|5.0|fantastic book. tragic, heart warming, and inspirational. the five people you meet in heaven and for one more day are great also
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  I wanted to recap the first season now that the third season just finished. I hope it has a long run on TV.
B005QPGHQU|1.0|This album has none of the feeling of Evanescence, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought it was a different group with a signer trying to sound like Amy.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on it.
0307361012|1.0|I ordered this book since I've read every one of the Harry Hole series.  To my disappointment, there are at least 40 pages in the middle of the book that were cut short before being bound.<br /><br />When I tried to mail the book back to the UK, the cost would have been over $25.00; far more than I had paid for the book.  Now I gues I can just imagine what the short changed pages said.
1607066017|5.0|i picked this book after hearing and reading rave reviews.<br /><br />was a little skeptical at first, but this book blew me away. the art is amazing and BKV's story telling and dialogue is immaculate.<br /><br />buy this book. you wont regret it
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Love interuption has some of the best lyrics  &#34; I want love to roll me over softly stick a knife inside me and twist it all around&#34;
B00APUYN0I|5.0|The movie is awesome! It is absolutely hilarious. I would suggest at least renting it if you're curious! I will definitely be buying the Bluray after renting and watching this movie! My boyfriend loved it as well, so it's not just a movie for girls!
B009EAO38C|5.0|I've loved the Piano Guys ever since they began their slow takeover of Facebook and Youtube. Their love of music and sheer passion shines through in the playful nature of their songs. The new takes on pop songs, sometimes mixed with classical pieces and sometimes simply spun around and put back together in a new way (&#34;What Makes you Beautiful&#34;) make every song on this album a delight. Can't wait for the next one!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I liked this Dark Knight movie better than the previous 2. This plot seemed much more positive and less dark than the previous two movies. I wasn't quite as annoyed with Christian Bale's voice as I was in the early movies. The blu-ray is excellent. I cannot wait to go through all of the extra on the disc.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fun and entertaining movie. It came as expected. I don't have anything else to say about it but it won't let me move on until i have enough words.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game! pretty good graphics too.  all ages can play this game but it still holds challenge.  its worth it to download!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|This movie was just okay.  There were some good funny parts but overall just okay.  Elizabeth Banks character was the funniest, love her.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|More and more freqauntly I pay the extra for the movie to be in Hidg Definition and only about 2/3 of them are. This is getting old and all my other HD's work fine, TV, Netflix etc.
0765325950|5.0|this, the final book in the Wheel of Time series, is everything one hopes it could be...<br />the gazillion threads Jordan/Sanderson were juggling all come to a satisfactory tie-up & Rand gets what's coming to him...<br />love it
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Interesting and quite detailed of Dr. Alexander's experiences.  I do believe God gives us small glimpses into His Spiritual World and Dr. Alexander is passing along one of those small glimmers.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is an excellent reader and I recommend it highly. Our book club will discuss this book in February and I am looking forward to this meeting.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My daughters absolutely love Taylor Swift.  I was very happy with the ordering process and how quickly the cd was received in the mail
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I liked this movie.  I wasn't sure I would considering I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan but I liked it.  Tom Cruise was actually decent in this movie.  I thought the love story was good and just the whole thing was pleasant and really good music.  Would recommend to anyone.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Enjoy the show and this is a great way to catch up if I miss an episode, go back and re-watch a scene or full episode if I have questions.  Like it.
B003719G40|5.0|I was inspired to purchase this book when I had two different guys ask me what was my Love Language and I had no idea what they were talking about.  After reading this book I found that it applies to romantic relationships as well as relationships with parents, sibilings and friends.  I found that the five languages are pretty much on target and it helped me understand myself better and how I can better communicate with my loved ones.<br /><br />As a single girl dating I was able to reflect back on past relationships and see how this could have helped me in the past and I this book is a good tool for anyone currently in a relationship.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|liked the ending of a LOOOOONNNNG series. glad it's done. still unsure if i like the ultra violet digital option because we had to set up a whole new &#34;air&#34; account for the utra violet co. and have to remember the pass word and that it is available. but the movie in blue ray and dvd are great.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|This movie has virtually no blood, violence, people getting killed every minute, explosions or multi-million dollar special effects.  But it has some interesting ideas that make you think.  Regrets, parallel worlds, love, sadness, redemption, self-reflection and a chilling surpise ending. An Indie film and nice change of pace from mainstream Hollywood fare. If you're into lots of fast paced action and F/X you may get stir crazy.<br /><br />On many reviewers top ten lists for 2011.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I truley enjoyed playing Twisted Lands Shadow Town because I truely enjoy playing hidden  objects or adventure games.  I would recommend this game .
B00632HWOG|3.0|Several times each week I am waiting on Yahoo to fix one of their problems.<br /><br />I want the option to &#34;Block&#34; some in-coming e-mails.  This was an optional a few years ago.<br /><br />It should have a simple option to automatically add an e-mail address I want in my contacts.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Giving this one star may not be fair, but I cannot figure out how to play this game. The tutorial seemed to have more confidence in my abilities than I did-after a few minutes of trying to move, the tutorial came back, said well, now you know how to move, you need to learn how to craft. I didn't know how to move, and I certainly can't figure how to craft. WAY too frustrating! When it turns to night, I can't see anything on the screen. Maybe I need a larger screen and a younger mind!
B0082JYAZ2|5.0|I love Regina Spektor's music. I have probably everything she's published... I love how she plays with her voice, treating it as various musical instruments. I absolutely love her voice and piano! Fantastic lyrics of the songs. The way she paints images and feelings is so beautiful. Her music not only reaches into the deepest parts of your soul but it takes you on a journey through the Universe(s). Truly multidimensional! It transforms the 'ordinary' into something new and wonderful. It expands!<br /><br />My favorite is 'How' ~ what a beautiful description of the feelings after a break-up, without judgment or blame... pure appreciation from the neutral place of real love. Simply AMAZING! I must be on the way to the Guinness Book at numbers of listen to one song. LOL. I absolutely love 'Firewood' (\\"Love what you have and you'll have more love...\\"). Thank You!<br /><br />The whole album is amazing, actually. From more than cute 'Small Town Moon' through funny 'Oh Marcello' (where Regina plays with her voice so cool ~ from an Italian accent to her voice-drums), playful and vibrant 'Don't Leave Me (Me Ne Quitte Pas), fantastic 'All The Rowboats' (which makes me think of Chagall for some reason), unlike anything else 'Ballad of A Politician', etc., to a simple & tender 'Jessica'. The whole album is another triumph of originality. I am so happy to see that Regina Spektor stays loyal to herself. BRAVO! Thank you for another masterpiece, Ms. Spektor!
B003QSMCKO|5.0|You can't go wrong with this Disney video. Mulan is one Disney Princess great stories, some familiar voices are used in the movie which makes it easy for the whole family to enjoy.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I read this after 50 shades & I thought it tried too hard to be like 50 shades. The descriptive language was a little more for my liking. Just wasn't very good in my opinion.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is an enjoyable game. I enjoyed finding the hidden objects and the adventure games.  I would highly recommend the game.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I read the reviews and it said that it deletes your progress but I updated and it didn't delete mine
0765325950|4.0|This book is one long fight, and is a who's who of the series. The characters are all super-saturated versions of themselves. Powerfully written, and a satisfying conclusion to the story. I teared up more than once.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Chose this to use with old Kindle that was not charging, but found it works great with my new Kindle Fire as well.
0345803493|5.0|The sequel in the Fifty Shades trilogy didn't fail to stimulate. I was riveted from the moment I picked it up. It is action packed and we start to see the softer side of Christian Grey. I couldn't wait to see how this turned out and rushed out to get the third installment.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Got the item weeks before time expected. Works great. No scratches. What i reviewed about the item before i bought it is exactly what i received. Im very happy with this.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|this was / is an enjoyable hidden object adventure game to play. Especially enjoy the extra adventure game after game was finished.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Both my 10 year old and I like to play it.  Rules are simple to understand, and you need to use a little brain to get better score.  But if you are short in this department, you could finish it anyway - like golf.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I have to admit that I had grown board with the original Angry Birds, but this added a spark of interst and I again find my geeky self swiping and tapping my way to earn stars level after level.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|This is truly a guide to feeling good about yourself, and the power that you have to change your life into infinate possiblities.
1416955070|5.0|I am in love with characters of this book. Jace is the perfect hero while Clary is the perfect heroine. You can't help but love Simon because we all had a Simon in our life at some point. They are all endearing. As for the action, it is non stop and you find yourself reading for hours with realizing it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have enjoyed this book very much. It is on par with the other Tom Clancy books that I have read. I requimend this book to any one who likes action and adventure, and fast paced excitment.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Like the court style of format. Has lots of surprises and quick read.  Kinda can guess &#34;who dunnit&#34;  half way thru but still  holds ones interest till the twist in the end.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Fantastic book.  The author used several modes to create and sustain interest very skillfully: alternating timeframes, mystery, unknown rules of a death game, incredible fantasy and deft description.  On top of it all, the book was delivered in one second.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Works well when I spill cereal, rice, popcorn, and broken chips which sadly I spilled in the first week of owning this device, but gladly it did the job and did it quicker then my old broom.  The only negative I have seen is that It will sometimes kick a pice of cereal clear across the kitchen but scoops it up quickly after I chased it down.
1586638491|5.0|I didn't like this book but this copy was very good. Although it was used when i recieved it, it was only written in once.
0345803485|5.0|This book is highly enthralling and I couldn't get enough or read it fast enough. I felt as if I was Ana's best friend and living through all of the events with her. This book moved so quickly, I literally devoured it. The cliffhanger drove me crazy and I couldn't get to the book store quick enough.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|This is great for what i use it for . I thank it is user preference though.I like the controls better than others.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|I was happy with the actual puzzles for my grandchild.  there are only 4 puzzles unless you want to BUY more
B005CWRB44|5.0|Perfect always with me on the key ring that is the purpose. Without the push button it is very short. The latest ones on Amazon  are already 170 Lumens. The head is sitting on firmly tight and the Fenix is not switching on by itself. I do not know about reliability.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awsome good book the best book I have ever read I can't wait till Jeff Kinney makes a new book
B00932A6G4|5.0|Yes is &#34;animated&#34; vs. live actors, but it DOES follow the same story line of the original movie and I enjoyed it, especially because I didn't need to pay over-priced hollywood actors a fortune in royalties to watch!!
0345803507|4.0|I simply love how this last book unfolded into an amazing love story. The whole trilogy was very intense. I was a bit disappointed in the ending. I'm not sure if it's because it was lacking or because I hated to see the story end and I  wanted more details and wanted to know more about them. I read the book in less than 24 hours and hated to see the series end. I will have to reread the series so that I can savor them a little more.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This is a video the puplic needs to see. People need to be more educated on the truths about fracking and we need more public involvment to stop the poisoning of our precious water. Until there is a proven and regulated way to cleanly remove the natural gas from underground it should just stay right where it is.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Great app for Jazz fans. All forms of jazz included, and no problems in using.  I'd recommend it for your usage. It would be great to have some videos of studio / club performances etc.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Before House there was Wooster. I have had the VHS version for 20 years. This has a few scenes I had not seen before and the image quality is much better.
B008OIQYTG|3.0|Lee Ritenour is an accomplished guitarist and session player who has graced so many jazz/pop/rock recordings I lost count. When I saw the concept for this record - reuniting with a lot of the master musicians he has played with in the past mostly the 70's and 80's it peaked my interest. Sorry but Lee just plays it way too safe. This has always been a complaint of mine with his approach. I have probably bought 10 of his recordings 3 remain in my collection. This is not a bad recording just very forgettable in general. His tune with George Duke and Stanley Clarke is really nice, but dredging up Corea's &#34;Children Song&#34; is a real question mark. His solos sound like they were written not improvised on much of this CD. Like Larry Carlton, Lee does much better on other folks projects. I'm sure his fans will disagree but I would not recommend this CD.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Purchased for me daughter and son-in-law but quickly &#34;acquired&#34; by my grandson who LOVES it; little fella plays with this for hours and the wear and tear on the I-Pad is relieved!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This second book is really something. Just when you think this young couple has been through enough turmoil, they are hit with another round. This second book was even more action packed. Will this couple finally get to just be a normal everyday couple with nothing more to worry about than what to wear to school? I love how this book delivered on all counts. I look forward to reading the next in the series as well. I can't wait to see what's in store for the Lena & Ethan and I look forward to the release of the movie of Beautiful Creatures in just about a month.
B0088X7YMS|5.0|I liked the first movie but not the second and third ones. I had no idea what to expect on this one but I came in expecting it to stink. It's a cartoon but it resembles the videos that you see in campaign mode in the Halo games -well done and intense. Like the first film, this one is for adults -not kids!
